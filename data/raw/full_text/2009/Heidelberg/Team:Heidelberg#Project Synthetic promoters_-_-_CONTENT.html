</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Abstract"> Abstract </SPAN></H2><P>Promoters are the key regulators of gene expression. Possessing promoters which are active under a desired condition, at a desired strength and in a specified tissue is of great value for Plant Biotechnology, Gene Therapy and fundamental research in Bioscience. Therefore, it has become a desire to synthetically construct promoters responsive to a variety of pathways. We explore two ways to the synthesis of promoters: On one hand, we have developed a bioinformatical model and database (<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT" title="Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT">HEARTBEAT</A>) describing the structure of promoters responsive to user-defined inputs. On the other hand, we have developed a biochemical method for the synthesis of randomized promoter libraries. Using this method, we have created a library of constitutive promoters of varying strength. Also, we have created libraries of promoters putatively responsive to a variety of pathways. We have screened these libraries for functional, pathway responsive promoters and present a detailed characterization of a NF-κB responsive promoter of our making. We finally discuss ways to combine randomized biochemical synthesis and bioinformatical modeling to propose a method towards the generation of promoters of complex regulation (i.e. by multiple pathways).
</P><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Synthetic_Promoters" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[TOP]</A></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Introduction"> Introduction </SPAN></H2><P>Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations. </P><P>Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of &quot;genetic switches&quot; (see <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[2]</A> for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[3]</A>. Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to <I>endogenous</I> signals (referred to as &quot;synthetic promoters&quot; in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[4]</A>). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[17]</A>) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.</P><P>Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[5]</A>). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested <I>in vivo</I>. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[6]</A> and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[7]</A> and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements  <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[8]</A>, but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[9]</A>, <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[10]</A>.
</P><P>In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several &quot;domains&quot;. The <I>core promoter</I> is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[11]</A>). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as &quot;enhancers&quot; and &quot;silencers&quot;. A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[5]</A>.

If knowing the response elements for the transcription factors of a pathway, any promoter can be assembled by this method.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>We have developed a standard method (termed &quot;Random Assembly PCR / RA-PCR&quot;) for the construction of randomized promoter libraries. We modified Assembly PCR <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[12]</A> to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[10]</A>) by inserting it into <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Measurement#A_promoter_measurement_kit_for_use_in_mammalian_systems" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Measurement">pSMB_MEASURE</A> (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K203100" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Part:BBa_K203100</A>), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization. </P><P>Please see a detailed protocol for RA-PCR <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#RA-PCR_protocol" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">below</A>.

We performed RA-PCR on oligos containing binding sites for some well-known generally activating transcription factors (<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia#Sp1" title="Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia">Sp1</A>, <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia#Ap1" title="Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia">Ap1</A>,<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia#CREB" title="Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia">CREB</A>, <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia#NF-Y" title="Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia">NF-Y</A>)  which we identified from literature search <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[8]</A>,<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[7]</A>,<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[10]</A>. We also added <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia#Transcription_factors" title="Team:Heidelberg/Eukaryopedia">NF-κB</A> responsive oligos as NF-κB has non-specific activity and is therefore used by a variety of viral constitutive promoters, e.g. the HIV promoter <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[13]</A>. We picked 24 colonies, two of which we dismissed after a test digest (not shown). Fig. 3 shows the sequence analysis of some randomly selected clones and demonstrates that RA-PCR is able to generate randomized repeats of oligos. We then measured the activity of the clones we picked by applying the <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Measurement" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Measurement">Concept of Relative Expression Units (REU)</A> we developed. Fig. 2 shows that we have been able to create a library of promoters of varying strength, some of which have an expression strength higher than JeT (which was attempted but not accomplished by JeT's developers <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[10]</A>). Such a library is of great value for fine-tuning gene expression levels.

Box 1 demonstrates how the oligos were designed from a frequency matrix.  33 clones were picked, miniprepped and transfected. NF-κB was then induced by the addition of <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Notebook_MaM#Induction" title="Team:Heidelberg/Notebook MaM">TNF-α</A> (2.5µM) for 10 hours, and left uninduced as a control. The plate was then scanned by TECAN, an automated fluorescence plate reader. TECAN is very imprecise on eukaryotic cells, and the arbitrary fluorescence we measured is not proportional to <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Measurement" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Measurement">REU</A> or another precise measure of mammalian promoter activity, but it can serve as a rough indicator of promoter induction. The result (Fig.4) shows that most clones appear not to be induced by NF-κB / TNF-α, whereas others are induced at varying levels of strength. Considering the sequence analysis of some randomly selected clones (Fig.5), this result is not intuitive, as most sequences contain a NF-κB binding site, but it demonstrates that simply cloning repeats of a Transcription Factor Binding Site in front of a core promoter will not necessarily work.</P><P>We picked clone 31 for further characterization in REU.

</LI><LI> For SREBP and Estrogen, we encountered technical problems during promoter synthesis (probably damaged HindIII enzyme) and therefore were unable to produce enough clones for  sufficient screening. For SREBP, we therefore cloned two natural, SREBP-upregulated promoters we had at hand and submitted them to the registry (<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Natural_promoters" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Natural promoters">Main Article: Natural promoter subproject</A>).</LI></UL><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Synthetic_Promoters" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[TOP]</A></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="HEARTBEAT.2C_a_model_describing_promoter_structure"> HEARTBEAT, a model describing promoter structure </SPAN></H3><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT" title="Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT">Main article: HEARTBEAT</A></P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><DIV style="text-align:justify;"><B>Figure 12: Probability density function for the distribution of VDR-Binding sites along an ideal promoter as modeled by HEARTBEAT</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><DIV style="text-align:justify;"><B>Figure 13: Frequency of other transcription factors occurring together with VDR. 680 transcription factors were examined, of which the displayed 340 show coincidence at least once.</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="text-align:justify;">Based on the assumption that transcription factors (TFs) have a spatial preference for binding to the natural promoters' sequence concerning the distance to the transcriptional start site (TSS) <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[14]</A>, we developed HEARTBEAT (Heidelberg Artificial Transcription Factor Binding Site Engineering and Assembly Tool). In a first step, 4395 human promoter sequences 1000 bp upstream from the TSS obtained from the UCSC genome browser were analyzed by the program “Promotersweep” <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[15]</A>. Promotersweep is able to assign transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) to a given sequence by retrieving and combining information from three homology databases (EnsEMBL Compara, NCBI HomoloGene, DoOP database), five promoter databases (EPD, DBTSS), six sequence motive identification tools (e.g. Meme, Gibbs Motif Sampler) and two matrix profile databases (Jaspar Core Library, Transfac Professional Library). Each TFBS motive is further classified into weak, conserved and reliable according to the quality of the assignment. The final result of Promotersweep can be divided into general spatial information about the TFBS and the consensus sequence on the one hand and further detailed facts about the associated gene on the other.
In Fig. 12, the spatial distribution of VDR (Vitamin D receptor) binding sites within 140 natural promoter sequences is shown as an example. The size of each bin equals the number of VDR-TFBS within a range of 20 bps. The solid line represents the probability density function (pdf). Here, the maximum of the pdf is located 54 bps upstream to the TSS indicated by the vertical line. Natural promoter sequences usually exhibit multiple TFBS which implies dependencies between different TFs according to their binding behavior to the DNA. Fig. 13 shows the frequency distribution of coincidental appearing TFBSs if VDR is present. The highest peak represents VDR itself. The next three highest peaks are Kid3 (inhibitory), WT1 and AP-2 (stimulatory). In total, together with VDR, there are over 300 different TFBS coincidentally present. Both plots represent data deduced from the Heartbeat-database which enable a well-defined synthesis of promoter sequences.</DIV><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Synthetic_Promoters" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[TOP]</A></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="An_in_vivo_test_of_predicted_promoters"> An <I>in vivo</I> test of predicted promoters </SPAN></H3><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT_database" title="Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT database">Main article: HEARTBEAT database</A></P><P>We tested SREBP responsive promoters predicted by HEARTBEAT and found only sequences matching the predictions best to be upregulated by SREBP (see figure).

Even by analyzing modest amounts of clones for each individual pathway, we were able to obtain promoters of a wide variety of strength and inducibility. Also, we were able to obtain constitutive promoters of greater strength than JeT, which has not been possible until now<A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[10]</A>.</P><P>Many insights about promoter regulation are possible by analyzing different promoters created by RA-PCR. For example, NF-κB clone 3 and clone 11 (see Fig. 4 and 5) differ only in the positioning of the single response element (RE), but still, induction strength differs threefold. This gives hints about Nf-κB's binding preference. A systematic study of promoters generated by RA-PCR and their strength can therefore be used to develop a comprehensive model of transcriptional regulation. This approach was addressed with the <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT_network" title="Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT network">HEARTBEAT-fuzzy network (FN)</A> modeling. HEARTBEAT-FN is used to predict the outcome of the designed sequences and in a reverse process to determine the quality of the synthetic construct.

From our cell culture work, we learned that finding the ideal timepoint of induction for a certain pathway and the ideal conditions is very difficult even with literature at hand. Also, one would expect a much higher induction than the one observed for the NF-κB responsive clone we describe. Our induction levels might be low because NF-κB has a high constant actvity <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[16]</A>, especially if the cells encounter &quot;rough&quot; cell culture conditions. This also explains the (small) induction of uninduced NF-κB responsive promoters we observe in Fig. 7. Therefore we suggest that for future screening, a library of siRNAs for the transcription factors of interest should be compiled. Also, a library of transcription factors mutated to be constantly active is required. With these libraries available, individual transcription factors can be knocked down, and activated specifically at 100% efficiency. This will greatly facilitate screening and parts characterization.</P><P><A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Synthetic_Promoters" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">[TOP]</A></P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Generation_of_down-regulated_promoters"> Generation of down-regulated promoters </SPAN></H4><P>As shown, we were able to generate a set of promoters upregulated by certain factors. For several applications, promoters of a high constant strength, which become down-regulated by a signal, are required. We think it might be possible to construct such promoters by performing a RA-PCR with oligos containing weak binding sites for generally activating transcription factors (that is, binding sites which deviate from the consensus sequence) and to add some oligos containing very strong binding sites for the transcription factor of interest (say, NF-κB). If this factor is not active, the general activators will be able to bind to the DNA and activate transcription. Upon factor activation, the general activator will be replaced. If the binding site is then in a position where it does not initiate transcription (as for some of the clones (32 etc.) shown in Fig. 4 and 5), the promoter will be downregulated, instead of upregulated. This hypothesis remains to be tested.

If a promoter regulated by multiple pathways, for example VDR (Vitamin D receptor) and SREBP (Sterol regulated element binding protein), is to be constructed, considering the density curves as obtained from the model (Fig. 12) can give clues about its construction. A working VDR/SREBP promoter requires VDR and/or SREBP Response Elements (REs) in the close vicinity of the TSS (at approx. 850). It might require SREBP REs between 300 and 700, and VDR REs between 0 and 300. This distribution can be reflected by setting up 3 RA-PCRs with varying concentrations of VDR-responsive, SREBP-responsive and spacer-oligos (compare Fig. 15). If a 3'Stop oligo containing a NheI cutsite, and a 5'Stop oligo containing a SpeI cutsite (or any combination of cutsites yielding compatible ends) is used, an infinite number of RA-PCR products can be assembled and cloned in front of a core promoter (having a SpeI cutsite 5').</DIV><P>We believe that this technique, termed Model-guided Random Assembly PCR, or M-RA-PCR, is the way forward to constructing the promoters of complex regulation described in the <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Introduction" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters">Introduction</A>.
