He has recently finished the 4th semester. He likes the idea of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. He is looking forward on working with a highly motivated, young team and learning much about arranging own scientific projects.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Simon Haas </H3><P>Simon is a Bachelor student in <B>Molecular Cell Biology</B> at the University of Heidelberg in the 4th semester. During several smaller internships at institutions like the BZH, ZMBH, HIP, ZI he gained experience in experimental molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry. He is fascinated by the idea of creating functional synthetic systems in biology. Besides Synthetic Biology Simon is highly interested in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience. He will continue his studies in Biochemistry at the Imperial College London next semester.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Tim Heinemann </H3><P>Tim started his scientific career at the Humboldt University Berlin with the Bachelor program of <B>Theoretical Biophysics</B>. Inspired by the beautiful cultural and academic atmosphere of Germany's capital he first encountered the field of Theoretical Biology. After three years he wrote his thesis in multivariate statistical analysis at the department of physics at the Free University Berlin. Currently he completes the second semester of his studies of <B>Systems Biology</B> within the Master's program Molecular Biosciences at the University of Heidelberg. During this work he realized that having knowledge in both the theoretical and practical field is essential to model biological systems. For example to make a good theoretical model it is necessary to be aware of the approximate character of the experiment and to evaluate the collected data. According to him this combination of the theoretical and the experimental approach is impressively realized with the iGEM idea. He is grateful to be part of this year's team and to have a nice summer with the students.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Corinna Hiller </H3><P>Corinna has finished her bachelor thesis about experimental and computer-associated search for p53 inhibiting agents with subsequent validation by crystallography at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) as a student of <B>Molecular Biotechnology</B>. As one of 30 other students she will start with the master of Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg in October. The iGEM competition demonstrates a unique opportunity to organize a scientific project and to meet a young inspirational team of students.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Nao Iwamoto </H3><P>Nao is a Master student of <B>Cancer Biology</B> at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). During his Bachelor's program in <B>Theoretical Biophysics</B> at the Humboldt University to Berlin he gained his strong enthusiasm towards Systems Biology. Before joining the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he worked as a student research assistant in the lab of Dr. Ursula Klingmüller (Systems Biology of Signal Transduction) at the DKFZ. Being a member of the iGEM team Heidelberg '09 he is looking forward to contributing to the exciting project on the theoretical side and is glad to share a wonderful summer with the students.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Stephen Krämer </H3><P>Stephen has just finished his 4th semester as a student of <B>Molecular Biotechnology</B> at the University of Heidelberg. He believes that biology can contribute to solutions to major challenges of the 21st century like the growing water and food shortage in many regions of the world. But in his opinion modern biology will only unfold its full potential if it will be based on a systematic foundation. This is the reason why he is fascinated by the ideas of Synthetic Biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Hannah Meyer </H3><P>Hannah has just started her fifth semester as a student of <B>Molecular Biotechnology</B>. In her second semester she has started working in the Tucker group at the university of Heidelberg where she has worked in the field of neurogenesis and nerve development. After having learned new methods in wet lab work, she is looking forward to bringing in her experiences but also to organizing and setting up own scientific projects. She is very excited to work in a new field of biology and hopes to have a great summer with the other team members!
</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Douaa Mugahid</H3><P>Biology for a better life is what Douaa believes in. Coming from a country where the availability of food and better health care is always an issue for the masses, she believes that as a biologist who can use science for the help of better, cheaper industrial/agricultural/medical use she has a lot to give to her own country and the masses at large. For those reasons Douaa studies <B>Biotechnology</B> as an undergraduate, but being faced with the immense costs that people are faced with in that industry in general made her want to think of how to bring them down. In silico optimization of biological processes away from the workbench in the lab seemed like the best idea, which is why she is currently doing a masters in <B>Systems Biology</B> at Heidelberg University. Being part of the iGEM team this year makes her know that as biologists there is so much we can do that is creative, useful and eventually cost effective and widely available for all researchers all over the world.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Anne Rademacher </H3><P>Anne also just finished her 4th semester of <B>Molecular Biotechnology</B> at Heidelberg University. Next to her studies she had worked in Faiza Rharbaoui's group at Cellzome for three semesters. Regarding iGEM she looks forward to a summer with students from different studies and a lot of fun experiencing a new field of biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Hannah Uckelmann </H3><P>Hannah is a student in the second semester of the <B>Molecular Biosciences</B> Masters Program with the major Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Heidelberg. She completed her bachelors degree in biochemistry at the Florida A&amp;M University in the states. She has experience in obesity and cancer research and hopes to be able to contribute greatly to the wet lab work in this years iGEM project. She is excited to work on this fascinating project with a great group of students!</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Lars Velten </H3><P>After finishing high school, Lars spent a year volunteering in Development Cooperation, selling solar power to Massai people in northern Tanzania. Perceiving plants as the better solar cell, and also interested in everything else (but urchins), he turned to study <B>Molecular and Cellular Biology</B> at Heidelberg U, where he has now finished his 4th semester. He collected some wetlab experience during an internship with Kartsten Weis' lab at UC Berkeley, where he worked on a project studying proteome turnover. He is looking foward to working in Synthetic Biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Bingqing Zhao </H3><P>Bingqing just finished her <B>medical study</B> this July in Peking University, China. The five-year study and internships in different hospitals has taught her a lot in medicine. This as well aroused her special curiosity for congenital disorders. She will continue her study in major Developmental Biology of master program <B>Molecular Bioscience</B> in Heidelberg University. Earlier this year, she took an internship at Prof. Eils' group, focusing on promoter measurement with real-time RT-PCR technique. This experience leads her to the iGEM team Heidelberg 2009. She is looking forward to an exciting and passionate summer with all the team mates!</P></DIV><DIV class="gallery"><H3> Chenchen Zhu</H3><P>At present, Chenchen is a master student of <B>Molecular Biosciences Major: Infectious disease</B>. He had studied <B>Informatics</B> in China for one year. After half-year learning of German in Berlin, he moved to Heidelberg and furthered his study in Molecular Biotechnology for three years. His main interest is in microbiology, especially in the research of Hepatitis B Virus.
