7-24-2009
start new cell culture: HeLa, U2-OS
7-27-2009
start new cell culture: MCF7
split HeLa and U2-OS (both from 7-24-09) 1:10
7-28-2009
start with stable transfection of HeLa, MCF7, U20S cells with pFRT/lacZeo following Effectene protocol
Washed(PBS) and changed medium of all cell lines.
Splitting  HELA- and U2-OS (from 7-27-2009) 1:10
7-30-2009
removed old medium
added fresh medium with Zeocin (stock at 100 mM (used all the stock for 50 ml medium) --> add to medium to get a concentration of 200 µM (1:500))
8-03-2009
stable transfection: changed medium (without washing)
Hela --> quite a few dead, but some areas seem to be dense
MCF7 --> many dead cells, but dense nonetheless
U2OS --> fairly dense and not so many dead cells
8-04-2009
splitted MCF7 and U2OS with Zeocin medium in new 6-well plate (each 1:10 and 1:5)
8-06-2009
changed zeocine medium of HELA, MCF7 (original well, 1:10, 1:5) and U2OS (original well, 1:10, 1:5)
8-07-2009
Hela: original 6-well --> kept 1/3, split rest in 2 petri dishes with 3 ml medium with Zeocin (--> final volume of 3,7 ml)
MCF7/U2OS: used 1:5 dilution (from 8-4-2009) --> resuspended in 2 ml and added 1 ml to 3 ml medium with Zeocin in two petri dishes
(MCF7 looked strange --> very long, almost like fibers)
8-10-2009
Zeocin selection: picked 4 Hela and 4 U2OS foci from petri dishes and transfered them to 24-well (see methods);
MCF-7 not ready
changed Zeocin medium in 6-wells (Hela, 1:10 MCF7, original MCF7, 1:10 U2OS -> original U2OS too dense)
used second petri dishes (Hela, U2OS) to split in 96-well, so that there should be 1 cell per well -> U2OS: counted 3x104 cells/ml, diluted 1:2, used 0,6 µl per well and prepared 24 wells; Hela: counted about 0,75-1x104 cells/ml, used 0,9 µl per well and prepared 24 wells
8-13-2009
selection of stable clones of U2OS
single cell wells: 5 96-well plates with one cell per well in 150 µl Zeocin DMEM+++ (originally 22,5*10^4 cells/ml)
selection of stable clones of HeLa
7 cloning disks placed on colonies visible without microscope (following protocol, see methods)
transfered cloning disk to 96-well
8-18-2009
split U2-OS from 6-well in large petri dishes (1:30, 1:50)
HeLa and MCF-7 from 6-well discarded because they looked sick
8-21-2009
HeLA from 96-well (8-13-09) trypsinized (20 µl Trypsin, 5 min) and filled up with 200 µl DMEM/zeocin
should spread the cells over the entire well
8-23-2009
restarted with Hela and MCF-7
split in 6-wells (4 wells, 10^5 per well)
8-24-2009
picked 7 U2-OS foci from 1:30 petri dish in 96-wells
transfected Hela in 6-wells (from 8-23) with lacZeo/FRT
MCF-7 not dense enough for transfection
8-25-2009
transfected MCF-7 in 6-wells (from 8-23) with lacZeo/FRT
changed Medium (DMEM+++) of transfected HeLa (from 8-24-09)
8-26-2009
changed Medium of transfected HeLa (from 8-24-09): now kept under selectionpressure with Zeocin in DMEM+++ (1:1000)
transferred HeLa cells derived from one clone from 96-well (13-08-09) to 6-well in order to expand them
removed transfectioncomplexes from MCF-7 (8-25-09)by changing medium (DMEM+++)
8-27-2009
split transfected MCF-7 (from 8-25-09) 1:2 and started keeping them under selectionpressure with Zeocin in DMEM+++ (1:1000)
8-28-2009
trypsinized HeLa and MCF-7 ( both in 6-well) and resuspended them in 2 ml DMEM+++/Zeocin
transferred 1 ml of cell suspension to 7 ml DMEM+++/Zeocin in petridish (10)
changed medium (DMEM+++/Zeo) of HeLa in 6-well (hopefully stable clon)
9-02-2009
splitted MCF-7 from 6-well 1:2 in another 6-well
picked another 8 foci from U2OS (petri dish) into 96-wells with DMEM+++/Zeocin
splitted rest of U2OS from petri dish 1:3 in new petri dish (10)
found cells in 96-wells with U2OS (2-3 cells/well)
9-04-2009
transferred 10 wells of U2-OS (2-3 cells/well) from 96-wells into 24-wells
9-07-2009
transferred the 10 wells of U2-OS (2-3 cells/well) from 24-wells into 6-wells
9-08-2009
splitted "stable" Helas from upper 6-well in flask (25cm²)
9-10-2009
splitted "stable" Helas from upper 6-well 1:3 into another flask (25cm²) (one third stayed in old 6-well, one third into flask and one third for cotransfection (3 times 3x10^4 in 6-wells))
washed and trypsinized "stable" Helas from lower 6-well
trypsinized U2-OS (picked with cloning disks 9-02-2009) and left in 96-well
washed and trypsinized Helas and MCF-7 (under Zeocin pressure, not picked yet)
spotted very weird/huge focus of Hela in one of those wells
9-11-2009
prepared two 24-wells with MCF-7 for Lipofectamin testing and transfection with linearized lacZeo plasmid
splitted four confluent colonies (#1,3,5,7) of "stable" U2-OS from 6-well (9-7) 1:3 into two other 6-wells for co-transfection with recombinase
9-12-2009
transfected (Lipofectamin) MCF-7 in 24-well with linearized lacZeo plasmid (SacI digested)
prepared one 24-well with Helas for Lipofectamin testing
"stable" Helas for co-transfection in 6-wells not dense enough --> wait before transfecting
"stable" U2-OS in 6-wells for co-transfection confluent --> splitted 1:3 (2/3 in 25 cm² flasks)
9-13-2009
changed medium of 24-well with linearized lacZeo --> added Zeocin for selection of stables
transfected Helas with Lipofectamin
9-14-2009

p55, p43, p45 (CMV, Cherry, Recombinase)
p31, p45 (JeT, Recombinase)
p55, p45 (CMV, Recombinase)
co-transfected four (#1,3,5,7) "stable" U2-OS (from 96-well with 2-3 cells/well) with p55, p43 & p45 (CMV, Cherry, Recombinase)
transferred three U2-OS colonies (#1,2,3 from cloning disks) into 24-wells
9-15-2009
changed medium on "stable" co-transfections --> DMEM+++ +Zeocin in the morning
changed medium on "stable" co-transfections --> DMEM+++ +Hygromycin (1:200) before leaving
prepared 1x10^5 cells (stable HeLas) for genomic DNA extraction --> works (15 ng/µl)
9-16-2009
PCR of FRT-site (to check if it's actually there) with O.243&O.244 and genomic DNA
9-17-2009

split "stable" co-transfected U2-OS 1:5 into another 6-well (except for #5 --> wash and put new medium on; leave in 6-well)
put PCR of FRT-site (9-16) on gel --> looks good (fragment should be 240 bp; is between 200 and 300 bp)
9-19-2009
changed zeocin medium of stable U2-OS (1,3,6,7 in flask)
split stable  HeLas 1:10 (flask)

9-26-2009
changed medium of yesterday's transfections
checked flourescnece of transfected cells:
CMV very bright
Jet, CMV_Jet , constituiv S4 and L4 no flourecence visible
9-27-2009

changed medium of the cells: DMEM+++/Hygromycin (200 µg/ml)
9-28-2009
cells of transfections are too dense; according to manual Hygromycin not effective if more than 25% confluent
split them 1:2 in petridishes
isolation of genomic DNA from
U2-OS "2-3 cells/well" # 1,3,6,7
U2-OS "cloning disk" # 5,6,7
HeLa (two samples of same clone)
MCF-7 ( from Yara,two samples of same clone)
9-29-2009
froze stable cell lines (3 of U2-OS, 1 of HeLa, 1 of MCF-7 -> all from picked foci using cloning discs)
checked "surviving rate" of cells under hygromycine pressure
HeLa: look pretty bad, only very few surviving
U2-OS: look better, surviving ones express GFP
started LAM-PCR according to protocol Schmidt et al. 2007
stopped with overnight capture after second linear PCR
Schmidt M., Schwarzwaelder K.,Bartholomae C., Zaoui K., Ball B.,Pilz I.,Braun S.,Glimm H.,von Kalle C., (2005) High-resolution insertion-site analysis by linear amplification–mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) Nature Methods 4:12, 1051-1057
9-30-2009
changed Hygromycine medium on transfections (remaining 6-wells and petri dishes; 200 µg/ml)
continued with LAM-PCR
began with hexanucleotide priming and stopped with overnight capture after first exponential PCR (Primer LCI)
10-01-2009
continued with LAM-PCR
second exponential PCR with primer LCII and reaction specific primer
gelelectrophoresis on 2 % argarose gels
reaction 9 and 10 successful, but more then one integration site per cell line
need to do topovector cloning, hopefully possible via GATC
10-02-2009
changed hygromycine medium: diluted 1:500 -> 100 µg/ml (stables should be selected -> make them grow faster with lower antibiotic concentration)
10-05-2009
new Hygromycine medium (100 µg/ml)
10-08-2009
picked foci of stable integrations (transfected 9-25) in 96-wells using cloning disks:
CMV (U2-OS): 5 foci
S4 (HeLa): 2 foci
JeT (HeLa): 1 focus
L4 (HeLa): 1 focus
used regular DMEM+++ (w/o Hygromycine) overnight
also put regular DMEM+++ on petri dishes overnight
After this day, we only changed medium on the plates with the foci. That is, because we had the LAM-PCR results that showed we had multiple integration sides. Thus, we figured we should not invest the time to clone the mixture of bands into topo vectors in order to sequence them.
