All cells for flow cytometry were transfected with the promoter of interest in front of GFP and the reference plasmid with JeT and mCherry in a 2:1 ratio. This ratio was chosen to ensure that we have GFP in every cell expressing mCherry and thereby increasing the number of double positive cells.
Time course measurement of 24 and 96 well plate (Fig. 1-2): Triplicates of cells transfected with the same promoter were loaded at different positions of the plates (Fig. 3-4) to ensure that the results do not change significantly over the time course of one flow cytometry measurement.
Figure 1: Time measurement 24 well. The bars indicate each triplicate located at a different position on the plate as shown in the scheme below. The standard deviations of the replicates are indicated by the error bars.
Figure 2: Time measurement 96 well. The bars indicate each triplicate located at a different position on the plate as shown in the scheme below. The standard deviations of the replicates are indicated by the error bars.

Crossinduction of NF-kB responsive synthetic promoter NIIL10 (Fig. 20): We measured the promosing NFkB responsive promoter NIIL10 (clone 31) in different media in U2-OS. Here, we want to see, if there is an induction of a nonspecific drug (Thiazolidinedione, 1:100 000) and how the different media affect the promoter activity. No significant change -> no influence/induction of the drug or medium.
