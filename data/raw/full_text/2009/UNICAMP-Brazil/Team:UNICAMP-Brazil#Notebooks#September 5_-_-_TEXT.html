MicroGuards
We made more 22 LB-AMP plates.

ColiGuard
Cre-Recombinase
The colonies with Cre Recombinase (BBa_J61047) plated yesterday grew up very well!
We inoculated four colonies in liquid LB-Amp media in order to make a miniprep tomorrow.
We let then grow for overnight at 37°C.

finO and finP Isolation from R Plasmid
After the successful recovery of the R plasmid (July 24th), we could start working on the isolation of the finO and finP sequences from this plasmid. We performed a PCR using the primers we designed on July 25th, and then we ran an electrophoresis gel with the products, in order to confirm that we indeed amplified the correct fragments.
As shown is the photo, the finO's PCR product reached about 600 bp, and the finP's PCR product reached about 120 bp. The size reached by both products correspond to the estimated lenght of the finO and finP sequences, suggesting that we amplified the correct fragments, and that we sucessful isolated both sequences from the R plasmid.

Terminator Biobrick
We purified the Terminator digestion from agarose gel using Pure Link Kit ( Protocol 7 ).
