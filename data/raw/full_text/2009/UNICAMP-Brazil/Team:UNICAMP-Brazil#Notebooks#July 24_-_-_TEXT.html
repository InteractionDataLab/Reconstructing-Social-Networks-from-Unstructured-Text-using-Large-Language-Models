R Plasmid Minipreps
Once we sucessfully recover the F plasmid, we now start the recovery procedure for the R plasmid. We will need this plasmid purified in order to isolate the FinO and FinP sequences (both related to the inhibition of the conjugative process).
We performed minipreps from R plasmid-containing cultures, according to Protocol 2 .
We then ran an agarose gel with miniprep's sample, also running a few F plasmid's sample as a band-size control.
As we did for F plasmid, we were also able to recover the R plasmid.
Gabriel, Marcelo and Victor.
