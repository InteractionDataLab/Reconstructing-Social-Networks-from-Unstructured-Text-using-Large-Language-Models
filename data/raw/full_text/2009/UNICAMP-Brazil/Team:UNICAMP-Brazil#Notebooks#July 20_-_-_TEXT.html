Restriction Assay
After the recovery of F plasmid (July 16th), we performed a digestion of the miniprep's product, in order to assure that we indeed recover the plasmid itself. We did this assay by using two restriction enzymes: EcoRI and ClaI.
We then compared the pattern provided us by pDRAW software with an electrophoresis gel of the digestion product. According to this assay, we indeed were able to recover the F Plasmid! =]
