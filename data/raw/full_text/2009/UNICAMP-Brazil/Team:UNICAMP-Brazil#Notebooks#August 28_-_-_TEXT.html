Kluyveromices lactis genes
The PCR for the K. lactis genes worked very well! =]  We got specific bands for the 3 sequences (agarose gel above).
Terminator biobrick
Colony PCR
The colony PCR was made to confirm the presence of terminator transformants, because  the antibiotic resistence is not working to any antibiotics.
We plated the cells in LB and picked up some colonies with a toothpick, inoculated on a backup LB plate and put the toothpick on a tube with 20µl H2O. Then, denatured these cells at 95°C during 5 minutes and heat shocked on ice for 5 minutes. Spinned the tubes and used 1 µl to make the PCR.
Preparing for Miniprep
We also inoculated 10 colonies transformed with the terminator biobrick to perform the miniprep tomorrow.
