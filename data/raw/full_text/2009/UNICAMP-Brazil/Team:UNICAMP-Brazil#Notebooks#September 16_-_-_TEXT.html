ColiGuard
F plasmid's digestion with HindIII
The digestion with the HindIII restriction enzyme was performed according to Protocol 14 . In place of the second enzyme that is used in this reaction, it was used the same volume of autoclaved distilled water.

PY Promoter - Transformation
After the O/N period we transformed the ligations PY1 + BBa_J23100 and PY2 + BBa_J23100 into electrocompetent E. coli bacteria, strain DH10B. We followed Protocol 3 (Electroporation) without modifications.
After the transformation we plated the transformed cells in LB-AMP plates and let them grow at 37ºC for an O/N period.
