Yeast experiments: Lysozyme
Today we began the tests with the yeasts transformed with the following constructions: YEP+pDLD-Lysozyme and YEP+ADH1-Lysozyme.
The pre inocula made yesterday grew.
We will have 10 samples at the end of the tests:
a) Wild type: inoculated in Ura+ media. No plasmid, no induction, no lysozyme expression.
b) Glucose ADH1+Lys: plasmid with lysozyme under control of ADH1, a constitutive promoter. No induction.
c) Glucose pDLD+Lys: No induction. Lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter.
d) Glucose pDLD+Lys 1: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 5mM lactate.
e) Glucose pDLD+Lys 2: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 25mM lactate.
f) Glucose pDLD+Lys 3: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 50mM lactate
g) Ethanol pDLD1+Lys: No induction. Lysozyme under control of Adh1, a constitutive promoter.
h) Ethanol pDLD1+Lys 1: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 5mM lactate.
i) Ethanol pDLD1+Lys 2: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 25mM lactate.
j) Ethanol pDLD1+Lys 3: lysozyme under control of pDLD, a lactate responsive promoter. Induction with 50mM lactate
We chose ethanol as a carbone source since it doesn't represses the lactate perception unlike glucose (Catabolic Repression). We inoculated the pre inocula in 50mL of each medium (YNB Ethanol Ura- and YNB Glucose Ura-). The wild type yeast is Ura- so we grew it on YNB Glucose Ura+. The inocula grew for 4 hours in 30ºC and 150rpm until the OD 1,3 before the induction with lactic acid.
We performed the induction 5 hours long. We mesured the OD every one hour to construct a growth curve. At the end of the 5 hours we pelleted the culture, colected the supernatant and freezed the pellet to analyze in SDS-PAGE tomorrow.
We also dripped drops of the supernatant in filter paper discs and placed them in a Lactococcus lactis plate. We hope to see inhibition zones surrounding some of the filters.
The Yeasts inoculated in YNB Ethanol media didn't grow enough to begin the induction until the end of the day.
