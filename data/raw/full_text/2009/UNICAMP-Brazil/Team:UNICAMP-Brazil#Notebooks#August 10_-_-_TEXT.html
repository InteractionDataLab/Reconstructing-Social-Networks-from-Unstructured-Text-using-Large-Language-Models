Recovering the BioBricks
Today we ressuspended the chosen BioBricks according to the standard protocol. Each undergraduated student was responsible to ressuspend a set of BioBricks. All of them were transfomed into electrocompetent E. coli cells (DH10B) according to Protocol 3 . The cells were then plated in LB media containing the appropriate antibiotic.
