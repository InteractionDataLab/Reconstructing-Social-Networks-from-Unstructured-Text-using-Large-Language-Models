Culture growth of bacteria containing the F plasmid
From a permanent culture of bacteria containing the F plasmid, a sample was inoculated into liquid LB-AMP medium and let grow O/N at 37°C.

finO and finP's transformed bacteria
All of yesterday's transformed and plated cells grew in the media!
We then selected 10 colonies of each transformation (finO+pSB1A3 and finP+pSB1A3) in order to confirm them. We inoculated those colonies separately into liquid LB-AMP medium, and let then grow O/N at 37ºC.
We will then proceed to the minipreps of the cultures and, once we could make another PCR for the inserted fragments, we will be able to confirm that both finO and finP are indeed in biobrick format.

PY Promoter - Purification of the digestion reactions
We purified the digestion reactions of PY1 and PY2 with the Invitrogen's PureLink™ PCR Purification Kit, following the manufacturer's protocol without modifications.
We also prepared an agarose gel to run the digestion reaction of BBa_J23100. The band in the gel had the expected size (2940 bp). However, it is not possible to confirm the digestion by the size in the gel because the difference between the plasmid BBa_J23100 with and without the fragment excised by XbaI and SpeI is too small.
We excised the band from the gel and used the Invitrogen's PureLink™ Quick Gel Extraction Kit to perform the purification, following the manufacturer's protocol without modifications ( Protocol 7 ).
