Gallus gallus RNA

The concentration values are ok, but the ratios 260/280 and 260/230 are not that good. Let’s find out what we see in the agarose gel.
Raíssa
Agarose gel
We have chosen the best samples from each organ to verify the quality in the gel. The samples are: Blood1, Blood3, Spleen1 and Oviduct2. We had problems with our UV transilluminator and didn’t manage to take pictures of the gel. =[
But we are going to tell you what we found! The bands were there, especially in the spleen and oviduct samples, not perfect, but we bet they are ok for cDNA synthesis.

Terminator biobrick and RBS+CFP ligation
We verified using electrophoresis, the digestion products of both parts digested yesterday (Terminator and RBS+CFP).
The gel showed we had no success with the digestions. Two inespecific bands appeared.
