ColiGuard
Selection of transformants
Today we selected 4 colonies of each transformation to confirm it. We inoculated them separetely in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic and let them grow O/N.
YeastGuard
Recovering the biobricks
We decided that we won´t need biobrick BBa_J04630, because the other two reporters are OK for our constructions.
We're going to need large amounts of DNA, so we inoculated colonies in liquid media in order to repeat the plasmid extractions of the six biobricks we are really going to use.
