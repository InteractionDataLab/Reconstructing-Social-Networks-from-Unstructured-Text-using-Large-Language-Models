Recovering the biobricks
In the LB-AMP plates we managed to get isolated colonies, but the LB-KAN plates were the same as the first we had. We think that the antibiotic is not working on these LB-KAN plates, since the supposed antibiotic for the terminator vector is ampicilin.
We selected colonies from the LB-AMP plates and inoculated in LB liquid media for the miniprep tomorrow.
We also inoculated colonies from the RBS plate for the miniprep.

Today, we performed two enzymatic digestions of two RBS, recovered in order to prove the transformations. We got it!!!
