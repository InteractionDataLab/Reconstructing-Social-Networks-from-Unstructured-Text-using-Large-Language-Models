E. coli transformation with F plasmid
E. coli DH10B electrocompetent cells were transformed using the recircularized F plasmid, according to Protocol 3 .
After the incubation time, 100 μl of medium containing the transformed cells were plated in LB-AMP-Xgal culture plates, and incubated O/N at 37°C.

finO and finP - Still Trying to Confirm our Biobricks
After the miniprep procedure, we performed PCRs with finO and finP's designed primer, in order to confirm that our inserted fragment is indeed contained in the vector.
As we had already got an amplified fragment of expected size from those colonies, we expect that those PCRs results in a successful amplification of our fragments. Moreover, as we aimed in reducing the amount of genomic DNA, we should got less inespecific amplifications.

CeaB and CeiB: Miniprep and transformation
Today, we performed miniprep ( Protocol 2 ) of the transformed cells and PCR again, so that avoids unspecific amplification. We didn’t get the expected band size again.
