Terminator biobrick
The biobrick BBa_J63002 was ressuspended from the plate and the transformed E. coli have occupied the whole plates, both LB-AMP and LB-KAN plates. We decided to replicate these colonies in other plates in order to get isolated colonies for the miniprep.

Enzyme restriction
We performed miniprep according to Protocol 2 and immediately made enzymatic digestion using XbaI and PstI in order to prove the existing part in the plasmids. We didn’t find the correct band size (514 bp); we just found the linear plasmid size band.
