Digested F plasmid's electroelution
The digested F plasmid (digested with HindIII) was electroeluted, according to Protocol 12 . A 110 V voltage was applied during 3h before its extraction from the membrane.
The next step is to verify if the electroelution went OK. The collected samples of purified plasmid will be applied to a 0,8% agarose gel.

finO and finP's biobricks confirmation
We repeated today the PCR's of the minipreps samples, once we now have received new Taq Polymerase enzymes.
We ran an agarose gel of the reaction products and, according to it, we amplified in a few samples a fragment with the expected size of finO! We couldn't verify this amplification for finP though.
Nevertheless, we also got several inespecific amplification in almost all samples. We considered that this was caused by the increased amount of genomic DNA we obtained after the miniprep procedure.
Therefore, we will perform another miniprep of the cultures by which we best amplified our expected fragment (highlighted).
