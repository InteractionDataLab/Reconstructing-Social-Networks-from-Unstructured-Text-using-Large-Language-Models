Biobricks recovered: RBS and CFP digestion
Today we started the construction of our first biobrick. After quantification of the miniprep products (from August 11) we performed the digestion ( Protocol 14 ) with SpeI/PstI and XbaI/PstI of plasmids containing the RBS and the CFP reporter respectively in order to connect these parts.
After the digestion we isolated the target bands from the agarose gel, according to Protocol 7 .
The CFP digested band was correctly purified from the gel. Unfortunatly, we lost the RBS fragment. =( It must have been lost at some stage of the purification, therefore we could not ligate these two parts today.
