Recovering the biobricks
5 plates from yesterday transformation had colonies. The other 2 transformed bacteria were replated into two diferent antibiotics and in higher cell concentration, in the morning. At night one of these plates showed colonies.
We inoculated some of the grown colonies of each biobrick in liquid media to perform miniprep tomorrow.
