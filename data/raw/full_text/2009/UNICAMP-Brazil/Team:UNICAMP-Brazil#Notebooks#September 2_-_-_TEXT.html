Lysozyme PCR: Gallus gallus template
The results obtained today were extremely awaited. We did the PCR using the lysozyme primers. There was a total of 13 reactions: one for each organ, using the 2 cDNAs (1: pDN6; 2: oligoDT) and the RNA without treatment (because there was still genomic in it!).
As you can see in the gel, we got specific bands from the oviduct sample! =]

RBS+CFP ligation
We verified using electrophoresis, the results of the digestion made yesterday (RBS+CFP plasmids). The gel showed we had no success with the digestions.
