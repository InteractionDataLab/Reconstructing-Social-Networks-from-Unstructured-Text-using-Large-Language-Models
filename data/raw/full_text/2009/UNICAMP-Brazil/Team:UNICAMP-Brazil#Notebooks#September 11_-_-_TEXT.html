New biobricks in biobrick format
The four ligation reactions that were reacting O/N were dialyzed for one hour before undergoing transformation into E. coli ( Protocol 3 ). 5µl of each ligation were used to transform the bacterias. After growing at 37ºC for one hour in LB medium, they were plated on LB+AMP plates and continue to grow at 37ºC O/N.
