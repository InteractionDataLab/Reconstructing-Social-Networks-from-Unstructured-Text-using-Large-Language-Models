Material
We found a farm that creates chicken for food production, and they have donated us the organs we needed to make the RNA extraction of Gallus gallus: the blood, the spleen and the oviduct. =)

We used the Trizol protocol for the three tissues ( Protocol 8 ).
We obtained pellets from all tissues! Hope their concentration and quality are ok! =]
