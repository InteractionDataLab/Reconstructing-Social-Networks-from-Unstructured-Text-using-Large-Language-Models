ColiGuard
Minipreps from BBa_E0840, BBa_I718017, BBa_J61000 and BBa_I78016
Today we performed minipreps from yesterday's inoculated cultures, related to the biobricks already cited.
We followed Protocol 2 , without modification.

Purification of pTet and double terminator biobricks
Once we digested those biobricks yesterday, we could proceed today to the purification of the target band from an agarose gel.
We used Invitrogen's Purelink Quick Gel Extraction Kit, following the manufacturer's protocol ( Protocol 7 ), without modifications.

CeaB and CeiB transformation into plasmid pSBA3
Today, we dephosphorilated the plasmid pSBA3 , and immediately started the ligation reaction of this unphosphorylated plasmid with CeaB and CeiB. Considering that the dephosphorylation use buffer that contains salt and that salt could be interfering in the transformations, we performed a dyalisis to get the samples free of salts. At last, we transformed competent E. coli (according to the protocol 3 ) and plated the respective plates. This time we expect to obtain transforming cells.

Dephosphorylation - CIAP test
The E.coli didn´t grow in any of the plates again. =[  We discovered that the electrocompetent E.coli that we used yesterday were dead! So we transformed another electrocompetent E.coli using the rest of the ligation reactions we had. We extremely hope to find colonies tomorrow!
