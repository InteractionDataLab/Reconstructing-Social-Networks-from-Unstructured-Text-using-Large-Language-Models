Electroelution verification
The samples from yesterday's electroelution were applied to a 0,8% agarose gel and submitted to 80 V during 30 minutes. A band of approximately 22 kb was visible, indicating that the F plasmid was succesfully purified!
Now that the F plasmid was obtained, the next step is its recircularization.

finO and finP - Still Trying to Confirm our Biobricks
We inoculated those colonies that actually resulted in a expected amplification size fragment after the miniprep procedure (recent assays), separately into liquid LB-AMP medium, in order to repeat the miniprep, aiming in reducing the amount of genomic DNA extracted together.

CeaB and CeB: Previous treatment, ligation and transformation
In order to avoid recircularization of BBa_B0015 plasmid, we tried it with alkaline phosphatase ( Protocol 9 ) . After, we started the ligation reaction of this unphosphorylated plasmid  with CeaB and CeiB respectively. Considering that this dephosphorylation uses a buffer containing salt and that this salt could be interfering with the transformations, we performed a dyalisis to get the samples out of salts. At last, we transformated competent E. coli (according to the Protocol 3 ) and plated the respective plates.  We expect great results for tomorrow!!!
