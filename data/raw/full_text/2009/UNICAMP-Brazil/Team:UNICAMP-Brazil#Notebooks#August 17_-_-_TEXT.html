Biobricks recovered: trying to purify the RBS digested fragment
The RBS band purification performed on August 15 didn't work, so we digested the plasmid again. Curiously the digested band was a little bigger than we expected , so we decided to check over it's size on Registry and we found that we ressuspended the wrong biobrick!!! Fortunately it's purification didn't work before! =)
After this finding we checked the other biobricks and ressuspended the correct RBS. We transformed it in E. coli, plated and grew it in liquid media.

Culture for Miniprep
We apparently got the transformed cells; we made the cells selection and inoculated the culture in liquid medium for tomorrow's plasmid extraction.
Recovering two RBS
We recovered two biobricks:
- BBa_J61100  RBS (Ribosome Binding Site Family Member)
- BBa_J61107  RBS (Ribosome Binding Site Family Member)
