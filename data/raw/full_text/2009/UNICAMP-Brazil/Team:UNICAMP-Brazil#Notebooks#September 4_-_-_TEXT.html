Electrocompetent E. coli
Today we prepared electrocompetent E. coli to use in our transformations according to Protocol 4 .
ColiGuard
Hemolysin Operon Amplifications
We tried again to amplify the hemolysin operon, but this time we reduced the annealing temperature to 50, 48, 46, 44, 42, 40 and 38 Celsius degrees. Again we do not had positive results.
The DNA used was extracted from wild strains alpha hemolysin positive, we decided to use an already known strain, O26H-, which probably has the plasmidial hemolysin.
Our primers was designed to plasmidial hemolysin and we don’t know if the wild strains have plasmidial or chromosomal hemolysin.

Cre-Recombinase without ATG
Today we started the construction of Cre-Recombinase without ATG, in order to made a new biobrick involving this construction. We ressuspended the biobrick of Cre-Recombinase: BBa_J61047  and transformed in E. coli DH10B eletrocompetent cells. We then plated on LB Amp plate, according to information from registry page.

PY Promoter - PCR amplification
Today we performed the PCR amplification of the PY promoter from the F plasmid previously extracted from the conjugative strain (July 16). We did two different reactions, using two types of forward primers (Ppy-F-1 and Ppy-F-2) for the same reverse primer (Ppy-R). The product amplified with the Ppy-F-1/Ppy-R primers has 133 bp and the one amplified with the Ppy-F-2/Ppy-R has 75 bp. We called these products PY1 and PY2 respectively. The sizes of the products were confirmed by an agarose gel:
