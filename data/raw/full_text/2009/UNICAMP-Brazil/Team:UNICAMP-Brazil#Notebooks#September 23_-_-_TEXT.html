CeaB and CeiB: colony PCR
We got apparently good transformations but we have to prove the correct position of DNA inserted. So, we performed colony PCR with right primers.
We didn’t get the band size expected and we found unspecific amplification, therefore we will make miniprep and we will try PCR again.
