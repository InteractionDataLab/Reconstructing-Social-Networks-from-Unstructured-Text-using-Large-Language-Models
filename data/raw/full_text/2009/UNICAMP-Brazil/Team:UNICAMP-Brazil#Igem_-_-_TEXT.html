International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM)
Since 2003, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of the most important universities of the world, organizes the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), in which students from world renowned universities gather together to apply genetic engineering techniques in solving the most pressing problems known today in industry, environment, health and other research fields. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.
