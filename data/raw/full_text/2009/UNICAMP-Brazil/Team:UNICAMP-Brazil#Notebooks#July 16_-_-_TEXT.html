ColiGuard
F Plasmid Minipreps
In order to start the Coliguard work, we performed minipreps from F plasmid-containing cultures, according to Protocol 2 . Since this type of plasmid was chosen to be the one which our E. coli strains will be carrying in, it's quite important to recover this plasmid (see the project overview for further information).
We selected four colonies from two strains:  Flac+ and Famp.
According to the picture, we sucessful recovered F plasmid from both strains, altough Famp strain's plasmid appears to be better extracted.
Gabriel, Marcelo and Victor.
