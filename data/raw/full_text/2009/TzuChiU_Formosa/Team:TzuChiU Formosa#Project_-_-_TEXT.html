Project
The Midnight Apollo
There are 9 power stations in Taiwan generating energy by coal and produce 269.1 million tons of CO2 every year. Power stations are one of the major causes of global warming. Our plan is to create an environmentally friendly system that could continually produce light without generating CO2 or pollutants and thus diminish global warming. We aim to create an eco-friendly, novel lighting system that free from combustion fossil power. We named it the “Midnight Apollo” project. The “Midnight Apollo” will be turned on when surrounding area turns dark and will be turned off automatically when the environment becomes bright. The idea is based on two genuine natural systems, Cph8 and aeoquorin/GFP. The Cph8 is regulated by visible light that can activate protein translation of an illuminating system. Subsequently, this illuminating system would use aeoquorin/GFP to light up the environment. Though it is a long way to make this system feasible, we hope the Midnight Apollo could be applied in producing eco-friendly street lamps, signboards, emergency lighting, or searchlight in the future.
Safety 1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  researcher safety,  public safety, or  environmental safety? No 2.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? Yes 3.What does your local biosafety group think about your project? Biosafe, would not endanger human or environment. 4.Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues? No If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
