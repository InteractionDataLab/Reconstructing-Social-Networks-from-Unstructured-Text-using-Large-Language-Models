In 1966, Master Cheng Yen established Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation which practices the philosophy of relieving suffering, giving happiness, helping the poor, and educating the rich. Nowadays, Tzu Chi people around the world reach out to the disaster areas, and relieve the suffering and agony of people in need.
Tzu Chi University was in the eastern region of Taiwan which was established by Dharma Master Cheng Yen to raise the level of health care and education and to educate students to do good deeds and help others. Furthermore, our university expects the students to continue carrying out even after they graduate.
With a spacious campus and green grass everywhere, Tzu Chi University provides well- equipped teaching facilities and a comfortable and graceful living environment, sponsors various student clubs, and provides a wonderful research atmosphere.  This is a university that blends professionalism with humanitarianism.
