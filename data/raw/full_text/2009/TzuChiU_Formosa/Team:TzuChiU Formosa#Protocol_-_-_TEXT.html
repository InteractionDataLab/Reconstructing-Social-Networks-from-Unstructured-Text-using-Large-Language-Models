Protocol
A. Culture CP919
B. Put Aqueorin-GFP into plasmid .
C. Transform the cp919 into the Midnight Apollo!
D. Sense the light.
E. In the dark,  the Midnight Apollo! is activated and emit the light.
Competent Cell (CP919-Cph8)
Day1. Streak out the E.coli strain on an LB plate (with kanamycin)and incubate at 37℃ overnight (16-20 hours).
Day2. Select a single colony and inoculate 10 ml sterile LB and grow overnight (16-20 hours) in a 37℃ shaker incubator.
Day3. Add 2ml overnight culture to 250ml flask containing 100 ml LB.
Grow the cultures to OD600 = 0.2~0.4 (incubate with shaking for 75~90 min.)
Spin down the bacteria at 4℃,3000 rpm for 10 min.
Discard the supernatant and mix the cell pellet with 10ml FSB.
Keep the cells on ice for 3~4 hours.
Spin down, at 4℃,3000 rpm for 10 min.
Discard the supernatant and mix the cell pellet with 5ml FSB.
Pipet 200μl of the cell suspension into sterile 1.5ml eppendorf tubes. Freeze these tubes in liquid nitrogen, then transfer them to -80℃ freezer.
Tansformation Protocol
Take competent cell in an eppendorf tube from -80℃ freezer put in ice.
Add 2ul plasmid to competent cell and place in ice for 5 minutes.
Put the transformed cells into 42℃ water bath for 60 seconds.
Then place the cells in ice for 2 minutes.
Add 1ml LB to the cells and mixed.
Put the eppendorf tube in 37℃ water bath and incubate for an hour.
Spin down at 7000 rpm for 5 minutes and remove most of the supernatant.
While the cells are incubated at 37℃ water bath spread 100ul Ampicilin(50mg/ml) on the plate. When the plate is dried, spread bacteria on the plate.
Incubate at 37℃ incubater for 16~18 hours.
PCR
1. Dissolve the primers in water to have the concentration of 10nM.
2. PCR reaction mixer：
Template DNA（10ng/μl）  5  10× PCR buffer   2  10× dNTP（2mM）   2  forward primer（10μM）  0.5  reverse primer（10μM）  0.5  Pfu DNA polymerase（2Kb） 0.1  PCR water   9.9  _______________________________________  Total    20 μl
3. Put the reaction mixer in a PCR tube.
4.The PCR program is as follow :
4.1
94℃    30 seconds
60℃    30seconds
72℃    2 minutes
Cycle   9 times
4.2
94℃    30 seconds
55℃    30seconds
72℃    2 minutes
Cycle    34 times
Extend PCR product at 72℃ for 10 minutes
5. The PCR product was examed by electrophoresis in 1％ agarose.
T-A cloning
Take an eppendorf tube and add following component one by one and mix well,incubated at 4℃ overnight.
2x ligase buffer 7.5μl  Insert(Aeq.-GFP) 5.5μl  Vector(pGEM-T-easy) 1μl  T4 DNA exp 3/12 1μl  _________________________________  total   15μl
Colony PCR(To verify the presence of our gene of interest)
Take 10μl of bacterial culture, spin down at 14000 rpm for 10 min.
Discard the supernatant
Add 500μl ddH20, Vortex
Boil for 20 min.
Take 5μl of above bacterial lysate, and add 10x dNTP 2μl, 10x Buffer 2μl, forward primer（10μM）0.5μl reverse primer（10μM）0.5μl, Taq DNA polymerase 0.1μl, ddH20
Use the PCR to amplify our product：PCR program
95℃ 4 min   94℃ 30seconds   55℃ 40seconds   72℃ 2 min  Cycle 34 times  25℃ 2 min
7. The PCR product was examed by electrophoresis in 1％ agarose.
Plasmid extraction(Homemade)
Transfer 1.5ml of bacterial culture to each well(24 wells plate)
pellet cells by centrifuging at 33000 rpm for 10min at 4℃
carefully remove the supernatant
add 100μl of Solution 1 (*)to each well, and vortex
add 200μl of Solution 2 (*)to each well, and mix gently
add 150μl of Solution 3 (*)to each well
spin down 3000rpm at 4℃  for 10min
add 1 ml 100% EtOH to new well
Transfer the supernatant to the new well, containing 100% EtOH.
spin down 3300rpm at 4℃ for 30min.
carefully remove the supernatant.
add 75% EtOH to wash pellets, then remove the supernantant, then air dry.
add 40μl ddH2O to each well, to dissolve with plasmid DNA
store the plate in 4℃
(*)Sol 1: 10m Miris/0.5mM HEDTA, PH 7.4 buffer.     Sol 2: 0.2N NaOH/1% SDS     Sol 3: 3M KOAC/HOAC
