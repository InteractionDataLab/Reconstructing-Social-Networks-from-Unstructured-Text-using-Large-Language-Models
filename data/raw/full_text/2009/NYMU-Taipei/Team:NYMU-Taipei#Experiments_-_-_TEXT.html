C-IgAP
K195405
coding 1257 BBa_K195405 C-terminal of IgA protease The leader sequence of C-IgAP is cleaved at the membrane by a signal peptidase, releasing the mature polyprotein into the periplasm. When in the periplasm, the beta-domain of the protein inserts into the outer membrane to form a beta-barrel structure. After formation of the beta-barrel pore, the passenger domain is translocated to the cell surface through the pore. Once at the cell surface, several possibilities may occur.

This device is produces damped oscillations between TetR and CII. The pRE (K116603) can be activated by CII (K116602), which in turn produces TetR (C0040) and GFP. The TetR then represses the pTet promoter (R0040) resulting in slower production of CII.
This design was based on the design of a relaxation oscillator (two component oscillator). This design does not produce sustained oscillations like a normal oscillator (relaxation based or otherwise) because of the two oscillating effectors not being able to directly affect each other.
