Motivation
We want to let our virocatcher know it is time to trigger downstream reaction when catching the virus.
So we design a signal transduction system
Design
Histidin Kinase Receptor(Detector)
We modify the ligand-receptor structure. Just mimic the method of construct photosensor in Bacteria.[1]
Histidin Kinase binding domain was replaced by our receptor of ViroCatcher. And do some random mutate to find out which mutant still have the funtion of receptor and can affect the phosphorylate inside of Histidin Kinase.
Before binding with virus,inside of Detector can be constitutive phosphorylate and turn on the OmpC promoter
After binding with virus, detector could be dephosphorylate and turn off the OmpC promoter.
ex:We construct TetR in the circuit that inhibit pTetR promoter.
When catching the virus,ViroCatcher can trigger the pTetR promoter.
Goal
Detector attach the virus, triggering the downstream reaction .
