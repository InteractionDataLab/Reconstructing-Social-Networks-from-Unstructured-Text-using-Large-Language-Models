Oscillator Modelling 1
TetR concentration
CII concentration.
1/3min intervals.
Variables Used
Protein Name
Half-life (min)
Promoter
Promoter Strength (relative)
Inducer
CII
8 [1]
pRE
0.025 (est)
Repressor
TetR
40 (est due to LVA tag)
pTet
1
Reporter
GFP
2160 [2]
Time segment used for the calculation: 1/3mins Maximum amount of Repressors that can stop promoter activity: 10 (an arbitrary number)
Formulas used
Calculating the strength of the pTet promoter when there are repressors around:
pTetcurrent = pTetmax*1-1/Tetmax*[TetR] ----- (1)
Calculate the amount of each protein produced:
CII = pTetcurrent ----- (2) TetR = [CII] * pREmax ----- (3) GFP = [CII] pTetcurrent ----- (4)
The calculation of amount of substrates remaining w.r.t the half lives:
[CII] = [CII] x 0.5(Δt / CII-t1/2) ----- (5) [TetR] = [TetR] x 0.5(Δt / TetR-t1/2) ----- (6) [GFP] = [GFP] x 0.5(Δt / GFP-t1/2) ----- (7)
Conclusion
The only variables are:
The relative strength of pRE relative to pTet (since it has not been measured yet)
the weaker pRE is relative to pTet, the slower the oscillator dampens.
Maximum amount of repressor such that adding more repressors will not affect the strength of pTet anymore.
Amplitude of TetR oscillation is directly proportional.
