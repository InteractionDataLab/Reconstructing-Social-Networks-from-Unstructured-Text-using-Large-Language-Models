About Us
The Receptors section is split into three subsections:
the virus receptors we used to bind to various viruses,
the autotransporter secretion system.
the signal transduction system.

Viral Receptors
We designed and engineered four different receptors to bind viruses:
CD4 (for binding HIV)
Integrin (for binding various viruses)
Sialic Acid (for binding influenza)
The scFv Antibody (for binding influenza)
The Autotransporter Secretion System
The Autotransporter system.
Signal Transduction
When the virus binds, a Signal is transduced to downstream.
