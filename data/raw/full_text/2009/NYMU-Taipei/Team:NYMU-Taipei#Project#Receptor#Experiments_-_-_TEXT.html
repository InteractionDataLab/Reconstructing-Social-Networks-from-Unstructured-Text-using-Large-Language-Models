Testing our receptors
We had created the viral proteins annealled with GFP.
The viral proteins include H1N1, H5N1, HIV's gp120, penton base and fiber protein of adenovirus. * As for influenza viruses, H1N1 may bind to alpha-2,6-sialic acid, while H5N1 may bind to alpha-2,3-sialic acid.
If we have successfully presented alpha-2,6-sialic acid on the bacteria's cell membrane, it should have the ability to bind H1N1 virus. When the binding of H1N1 with alpha-2,6-sialic acid happened, we may observe the fluorescence of GFP on the membrane coated with our ViroCatcher because after binding with our ViroCatcher, virus is too big to flow through the membrane.
If no binding, it may indicate that our experiments failed to transfer alpha-2,6-silic acid onto the cell membrane.
