From 2009.igem.org
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250x buffer P1 (kept at 4C) and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube
Add 250x  buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4-6 times to mix
Add 350x Buffer N2 and invert the tube immediately but gently 4-6 times
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13k rpm (~17,900 xg) in a microcentrifuge
Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting of pipetting
Centrifuge for 30-60s. Discard the flow-through
Wash QIA prep spini column by adding .75mL buffer PE and centrifuging for 60-70s
Discard the flow through and centrifuge for and additional min to remove residual wash buffer
Place the QIA prep column in a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50x Buffer EB (10mm onj.cl pH8-5) or water to the center of each QIA prep spin column. Let stand for 1 min. and centrifuge for 1 min.
