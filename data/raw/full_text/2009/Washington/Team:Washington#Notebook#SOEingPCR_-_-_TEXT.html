SOEing PCR
Design primers
VF2 / VR = standard forward and revers primer from original construct
For mutations/insertions/deletions of 1-15 base pairs
Forward: 5'-----------------------XXXX-----------------3'
Template: 5'----------------------------------------------3'
Reverse: 3'-----------------------XXXX-----------------5'
X = mismatch base pair with template
- = Matching base pair with template. Make sure that 15-25 base pairs match. The Tm of the matching regions should be >60C, and the GC content 40%-60%
For mutations/insertions/deletions of 15+ base pairs
Forward: ..............................................5'-XXXX-----------------3'
Template:..5'------------------------------------------------3'
Reverse:...3'-----------------------XXXX-5'
X = mismatch base pair with template
- = Matching base pair with template. Make sure that 15-25 base pairs match. The Tm of the matching regions should be >60C, and the GC content 40%-60%
PCR: Adding the mutations
An example assembly altering DNA at three different points (can do this with as many or as few as needed for your application)
Top Strand..... T7F........M1-F..................M2-F....................M3-F...................
Ref Sequence ...................X.........................X...........................X.....................
Bottom Strand ...............M1-R..................M2-R....................M3-R............T7R
MX-F = forward mutation primer X
MX-R = reverse mutation primer x
X = mutation site
..... = place holder
Samples, 1 set without DMSO, 1 set with 5% DMSO
T7F+M1-R
M1-F+M2-R
M2-F+M3-R
M3-F+T7R
PCR 1 Master Mix
36.5uL dH2O
10uL Phusion Buffer
1uL plasmid template
1uL 25mM dNTPs
0.5uL 100uM Forward primer
0.5uL 100uM Reverse primer
0.5uL Phusion
PCR 1 Cycle
98C, 30sec
98C, 10sec
58C, 10sec
72C, 30sec/kb
Repeatsteps2-4 29x
72C, 5min
4C, forever
Run DNA gel (5uL PCR reaction + 1uL 6x loading dye)
possible outcomes
Single band at correct fragment size. PCR purify all of PCR product and spec
Do not PCR purify chunks less that 70bp, estimate concentration based on gel
Multiple bands.Run another gel using all PCR product, gel purify correct band, spec
No bands / no bands at correct length. Change annealing temperature of PCR to gradient (55-72)
PCR 2: Putting the pieces together
Need equal-molar concentrations of each piece,normalize concentration to size
Make 20uL mix of the pieces
If DMSO worked in PCR 1, add 5% DMSO in PCR 2
PCR 2 Master Mix
18.5uL dH2O
20uL of pieces mix
10uL of Phusion Buffer
1uL 25mM dNTPs
0.5uL Phusion
PCR 2 cycle
98C, 30sec
98C, 10sec
58C,10sec (or same as PCR 1)
72C, 30sec/kb
Repeat steps 2-4 5x
72C, 5min
4C, forever
No need to purify or anything after PCR 2, just go directly to PCR#3. (I have PCR purified after this step (do not gel purify) and had everything still work though.)
PCR 3: Amplifying full length construct
If DMSO worked in PCR 1, add DMSO 5% in PCR 3
PCR 3 Master Mix
36.5uL dH2O
10uL Phusion Buffer
1uL PCR 2 product
1uL 25mM dNTPs
0.5uL 100uM T7F
0.5uL 100uM T7R
0.5uL Phusion
PCR 3 cycle
98C, 30sec
98C, 10sec
58C,10sec (Tm for T7)
72C, 30sec/kb
Repeat steps 2-4 29x
72C, 5min
4C, forever
Run gel
Possible outcomes
Single band at correct fragment size, PCR purify your final product
Multiple bands, run another gel using all PCR product, gel purify correct band
No bands or no bands at right size, Change annealing temperature of PCR to gradient (55-72)
Next Step: Standard cloning
digest,purify,ligate,transform
