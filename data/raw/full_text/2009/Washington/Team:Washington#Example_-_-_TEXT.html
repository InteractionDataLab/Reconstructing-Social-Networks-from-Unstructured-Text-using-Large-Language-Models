I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REMOVE THE CONTENTS THING FROM THE TOP BUT I THINK WE SHOULD TURN IT INTO OUR SIDE BAR
EXAMPLE PAGE
Throughout these pages you will have two sidebars: one on the left that is the main sidebar for the wiki that has all of the important pages listed, one on the right that is specific to this project page that organizes that particular page.
BANNER GOES HERE
SMALL GRAPHIC FROM MAIN PAGE AND DESCRIPTION OF GOAL ex. "The Secretion System easily recognizes secretion tag on A Favorite Protein and exports that protein to the extracellular milieu."
This is the background and design section.  "There have been many secretion systems documented for Gram-negative bacteria.  We chose X system because it has been described to have N characteristics [Reference] and it has been previously shown to secrete proteins [References]."
More Detailed Graphic Goes Here
For example parts list / plasmid of the system, or whatever graphic technically describes this portion.
Part A has these characteristics.  This part spans the inner and outer membranes and acts as a pore, with a mechanism to selectively recognize the secretion tag described in the Target section.
Part B has these characteristics.  This part is embedded in the outer membrane and contributes to secretion in a way that has not yet been defined.
Etc.
Construction (and Data) Section
Short sentence explaining experiment.  "In order to test whether we were getting expression of the display protein, we first performed a Western blot analysis with an anti-his detection reagent.  We incubated overnight cultures and HERE IS WHERE YOU DESCRIBE THE EXPERIMENT."
- And explanation of the data figure.  "We found that..."
CONCLUSION about the data.  "This demonstrates that our proteins are being expressed inside of the cell."
Repeat as needed for more data.
At the end of the page, be clear about what was generated and where we stopped, and what work (if any) remains to be done.
