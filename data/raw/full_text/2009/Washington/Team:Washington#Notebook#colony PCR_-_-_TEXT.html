Colony PCR
Prepare one sterile 0.6mL tube with the following reaction mixture for each colony you intend to pick.
5uL Qiagen Master Mix
1uL 40uM VF2
1uL 40uM VR
Prepare one sterile 0.6mL tube with 20uL sterile diH2O for each colony you intend to pick.
Pick colonies
Pick a single colony using a micropipettor with sterile tip. The pippettor should be set to 3uL
Aspirate colony into 20uL diH2O vigorously to transfer cells to diH2O
Transfer 3uL of diH2O containing cells to reaction mixture set up in step 1
Run reaction
94C - 3min
94C - 30s
55C - 30s
72C - 1min / kb gene
repeat 2 - 4 29x
72C - 10min
4C - forever
