Project Goals
Develop the prototype of an easily an automated liquid handling system that satisfy the following constraints
Low Cost – Cost significantly lower than $10,000.
Hardware Platform that is easily accessible
Hardware Design that is easily replicable  by other iGEM teams.
Software Design  that is robust, plug and play. Can swap modules from other iGEM teams.
Design that is easily extensible, to allow future collaboration with other iGEM team.
Achievements of Goals
We have developed BioBrick-A-Bot Model C, which satisfy all the goals listed above, as follows
Low Cost – Cost under $700. Require 2 NXT Kit ($278 each), Wooden Frame ($30 materials) and RobotC ($50).
Hardware Platform – We selected Lego Mindstorm NXT Kit which is the industrial standard  and is easily available.
Hardware Design – We provide detail instructions of how BioBrick-A-Bot is built, so that other iGEM team can build it.  We checked in the Hardware Design document into iGEM registry.
Software Design is robust, plug and play. We introduce a new concept called LegoBioBrick which consist of a LegoNXT Brick connected to 1-3 motors, doing a specific  tasks in BioBrick assembly. The software should be flexible enough to plug-and-playmultiple LegoBioBrick instances build by different iGEM teams, with different physical dimensions and geometric dimensions. 2 prototype instances, ALPHA-120 and ALPHA-90 are developed to proof the point.
We implemented BioBrick-A-Bot using 2 LegoBioBrick modules ALPHA and PHI, mounted on a frame BETA which can communicate well with each other using Master Slave Synchornization.  A demonstration of its functionality by transferring colored dyes on a 96-well plate is provided. We made the software open-source, so that other iGEM team can easily replicate BioBrick-A-Bot or extend its functionality by adding additional modules. In the next version of (BioBrick-A-Bot Version 2.0) we will also add another module called MU, which is a Movement Utility.
