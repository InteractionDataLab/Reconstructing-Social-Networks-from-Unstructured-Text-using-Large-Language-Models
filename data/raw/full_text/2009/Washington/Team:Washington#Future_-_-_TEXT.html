Overview
Target Construct
Attempt to add additional proteins into the vector and test for functionality
Vary linker lengths
Make a simpler version for trouble shooting the secretion system: [6x-His]-[NheI]-[prtB]
Transfer to a vector with the same origin and resistance as described in the original secretion system (pBR322+Carb).
Add a lacI into the expression and target vectors so repression is hard-coded into the vector and expression can be induced regardless of the cell line.
Secretion System
Transfer to a Chlor resistance, p15A origin vector as used in the original papers
Add original upstream DNA (50bp) before the native RBS to ensure proper function
Add an arabinose inducible promoter for better control over secretion system activation
Combine with target vector so entire secretion system is contained in one plasmid.
Display System
Construct a new modular display system:  CDS
Use computational protein design to create a monomeric protein that binds tightly to biotin:  FoldIt
