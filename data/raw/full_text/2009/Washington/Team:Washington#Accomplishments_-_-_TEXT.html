University of Washington 2009 iGEM Team Accomplishments
Demonstrated that at least one new BioBrick Part of our own design works as expected
BBa_K215000 Target Expression Vector - expresses a favorite protein fused to streptavidin-binding Nano-Tag, secretion tag that directs export of the protein, and a His tag - all tags are removable by incubation with TEV protease. Find this in our wiki
BBa_K215091 Expresses OpdA, a nerve agent-degrading enzyme. Find this in our wiki
BBa_K215000 Protein Expression Vector - when IPTG-induced, expresses a protein with strong promoter and RBS (a good combination of BioBricks not previously found in the Registry). Find this in our wiki
Characterized existing BioBrick Parts and documented this information on the Registry
Find these in our wiki
BBa_J36848 2006 Harvard iGEM Streptavidin Cell Surface Display Construct - monomeric streptavidin, one OmpA transmembrane helix
BBa_J36849 2006 Harvard iGEM Streptavidin Cell Surface Display Construct - single chain dimeric streptavidin, one OmpA transmembrane helix
BBa_J36850 2006 Harvard iGEM Streptavidin Cell Surface Display Construct - monomeric streptavidin, five OmpA transmembrane helices
BBa_J36851 2006 Harvard iGEM Streptavidin Cell Surface Display Construct - single chain dimeric streptavidin, five OmpA transmembrane helices
Synthesized and BioBricked type I secretion system from Erwinia chrysanthemi
Find these in our wiki
BBa_K215107 , Type I secretion system from Erwinia Chrysanthemi, constitutive expression, low copy, STRONG PROMOTER
BBa_K215108 , Type I secretion system from Erwinia Chrysanthemi, constitutive expression, low copy, MEDIUM PROMOTER
BBa_K215109 , Type I secretion system from Erwinia Chrysanthemi: constitutive expression, low copy, WEAK PROMOTER
Developed assay to quantify secreted protein
This assay assess for the presence of secreted His-tagged protein in the growth media by running media over a nickel column (His-tagged proteins will be retained), wash column, and elute protein.  Eluted protein is quantified by comparing to a calculated standard curve. Find this in our wiki
Designed new modular surface display system
This BioBrick is designed to express any protein as a cell surface display protein, using the well-characterized Lpp-OmpA cell surface display system.  Generated BioBrick, functionality not confirmed. Find this in our wiki
Worked on computational design of novel biotin-binding protein using Rosetta and Fold-It
Find this on our wiki
Gained real-world synthetic biology experience
We learned about the power of synthetic biology to address real-world problems, gained experience in designing and constructing our own molecular biology projects, and discovered that proficiency in troubleshooting is a must with synthetic biology. Find us in our wiki
BioBricks
Target Vector
BBa_K215002 Is a BioBrick part that was designed to work in conjunction with the Secretion System ( BBa_K215107 ). Expression of protein from this vector creates a fusion protein that contains the prtB secretion signal recognized by the secretion system.  The fusion protein also contains: a Nano-Tag to the protein that is able to bind Streptavidin, Histidine Epitope Tags for easy protein purification, and TEV protease sites for removing all tags from the expressed protein.
This part is composed of:
BBa_K215000 : Protein Expression Vector
BBa_K215001 : Fusion protein sequence
This part is used in:
BBa_K215010 : GFP fusion protein
BBa_K215011 : BBa_K215090 (organic phosphotriesterase) fusion protein
Current Status: Complete
Secretion System
BBa_K215107 Is the BioBrick version of the Type 1 secretion system from Erwinia Chrysanthemi. It directs the secretion of proteins that contain the prtB C-terminus Epitote tag. To create a fusion protein with the prtB tag see BBa_K215002 .
This part is composed of
BBa_K215100 : Gene encoding prtD
BBa_K215101 : Gene encoding prtE
BBa_K215102 : Gene encoding prtF
BBa_K215103 : BBa_K21500 + BBa_K21501 prtD + prtE
BBa_K215104 : BBa_K25103 + BBa_K25102 prtD + prtE + prtF
BBa_K215105 : BBa_K215104 + BBa_B0014 in PSB1AK3 prtDEF + Terminator
BBa_K215106 : BBa_K215104 + BBa_B0014 in PSB3T5 prtDEF + Terminator
BBa_K215108 : BBa_J23114 + BBa_K215106 (Medium Promoter + prtDEF-Terminator)
BBa_K215109 : BBa_J23113 + BBa_K215106 (Weak Promoter + prtDEF-Terminator)
Current Status: In progress
Display System
BBa_K215200 is a Display vector that will allow for the presentation of any protein on the cell surface by fusing the protein to the transmembrane region of Outer Membrane Protein A (OmpA). The fusion protein contains a GS peptide linker to space the displayed protein away from the outer membrane and also contains a TEV protease site to allow for purification of the displayed protein.
This Part is composed of:
BBa_K215201 : Display Vector with 5 trans-membrane OMPA
BBa_K215250 : Coding Sequence for fusion protein scaffold, 1 trans-membrane OMPA
BBa_K215251 : Coding Sequence for fusion protein scaffold, 5 trans-membrane OMPA
This Part is used in:
BBa_K215210 : Display system (1 trans-membrane) in protein expression vector
BBa_K215211 : Display system (5 trans-membrane) in protein expression vector
BBa_K215260 : BBa_K215210 fused to Streptavidin
BBa_K215261 : BBa_K215211 fused to Streptavidin
Current Status: In progress
