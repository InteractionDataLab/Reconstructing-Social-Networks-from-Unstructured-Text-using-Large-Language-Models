Who we are
The Team (Josef, Jeff, Alex, Chris, Doug/Conan)
Stupendous Students
Josef Dunbar, Bio-Chemistry "Johny was a chemist's son, Johny is no more, what Johny thought was H2O was H2SO4"
Jeff Nivala, Bioengineering "I see no true difference between art and science. They are both merely manifestations of life's suffering."
Douglas White, Bioegineering "The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual."
Alex Leone, Physics "This is not Doug's quote."
Chris Eiben, Cell Molecular & Developmental Biology "The freethinking of one age is the common sense of the next."
Awesome Advisors
Ingrid Swanson, Microbiology "Undergraduates are the workhorses of the world."
Rob Egbert, Electrical Engineering "It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop."
Sean Sleight, Bioengineering "Please pass the pitcher of resveratrol beer."
Justin Siegel, Biological Chemistry "Something clever..."'
Fantastic Faculty
Eric Klavins, Electrical Engineering
Where we worked
We were very fortunate to have the use of two molecular biology workspaces: a dedicated undergraduate lab in the Electrical Engineering Department that had been set up for basic molecular biology work, and the lab of Dr. David Baker in Biochemistry.
Between some shelves in the Baker lab, Chris eyes some RFP-expressing bacterial pellet that Josef produced.  Great pellet Josef!
Doug rocks the purple gloves in the undergraduate molecular biology lab in the Electrical Engineering Department.
Jeff, a two-year iGEM veteran, has mastered the art of standing while pipetting.
Josef in the iGEM lab, working hard - that gel is not going to load itself.
This is how Alex pipettes.
Gene synthesis from scratch requires a lot of oligos!  (See our Notebook page)
Support
Funding for supplies and travel was obtained from the Departments of Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, and the College of Engineering.
We also received several free samples of reagents from the BioMoles gel purification kits, PCR purification kits, and a pair of agarose gels, as well as a DNA ladder.
