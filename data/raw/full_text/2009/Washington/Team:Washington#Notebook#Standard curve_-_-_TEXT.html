Generating a Standard curve for GFP concentration
Purify GFP-fused protein using traditional purification protocol
Measure absorption at 280nm to quantify protein amount
Serially dilute protein into plate and read fluorescence, excitation 485nm, emission 525nm
Compare values of protein concentration to fluorescence to create a standard curve allowing for the comparison of fluorescence to protein level
