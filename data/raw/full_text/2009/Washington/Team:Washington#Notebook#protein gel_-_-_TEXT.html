Protein Gel
Set up overnights of parts J36848-J36851
Dilute 1μL overnight into 1mL broth
Add 1 mM IPTG and let grow for four hours
After cells have grown up to saturation, heat water to a boil
Add 100μL of overnight to a 1.5mL tube
Pellet by spinning at max speed for 30 secs in the microcentrifuge
Discard supernatant
Pull an aliquot of 5x sample loading buffer out of the freezer and thaw
Add 20uL BME to aliquot
Resuspend samples in 50μL sample loading buffer (pipette up/down)
Boil samples for 10 minutes
While boiling, prepare 500mL 1x SDS buffer:
50mL 10x buffer to 450mL water
Take a gel out of the fridge and and put it in the gel box (keep the gel container for staining!!!)
Pour the mixed buffer solution into the half of the gel box that the gel is in
Remove the gel comb
Fill the little container on the top of the gel until it's about 0.5 cm from the top with buffer
Remove any bubbles in the wells
Vortex samples
Spin down samples for a few seconds
Load 3μL into each well
Load 10μL of ladder in appropriate wells
Run at 180V until the dye is about to fall off the gel
