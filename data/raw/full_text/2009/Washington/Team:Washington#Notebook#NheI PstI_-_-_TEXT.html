Gene Assembly using the NheI and PstI sites
Start with first 23 coding nucleotides of gene, eg. 5'-atgcgtaaaggagaagaacttt...-3'
Replace the atg start codon with the XbaI site: 5'-TCTAGA-3', eg. 5'-TCTAGAcgtaaaggagaagaacttt-3'
Add 6-8 random nucleotides to the 5' end of the primer, eg. 5'-cgggcTCTAGAcgtaaaggagaagaacttt-3'
Tweak the 3' end of the primer (add /remove nucleotides) so that the annealing temperature is close to that of VR
Amplify your gene using the designed forward oligo and VR
PCR purify the PCR product
To ensure that the proper size fragment was amplified 5uL of PCR reaction can be run on an agarose gel
Digest PCR product with XbaI and PstI
PCR purify
Digest Vector with NheI and PstI
PCR purify
Mix insert and vector in 3:1 ratio and ligate
Transform into competent cells
Screen cells for correct insert using VF2 and VR
