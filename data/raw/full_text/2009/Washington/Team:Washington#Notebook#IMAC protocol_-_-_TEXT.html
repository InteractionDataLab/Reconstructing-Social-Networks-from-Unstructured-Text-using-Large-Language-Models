BioRad Micro Column Protein Prep Protocol
Day 0:  Clone gene of interest into vector of interest using standard cloning techniques.
Day 1: Overnights
Pick a single colony from plate and inoculate 1mL fresh media, with proper antibiotic, in 15mL culture tube
Place lid on tube as not to form an air tight seal
Shake at 37C for 16-24 hours at 200+ rpm
Day 2: Expression
Inoculate 50mL media with 500uL over night, in 250mL flask
Shake 250mL flask at 37C at 200+ rpm
Monitor OD600 of culture until OD600 ~0.4
Use 200uL of culture and 800uL water in 1mL cuvette
Read OD600 and multiply by 5 t get original OD600
Should take ~2-3 hours
INDUCE culture once culture gets to OD600 ~0.4 with IPTG so that the final concentration of IPTG is 0.5mM (ie 25uL 1M IPG for 50mL culture)
Place in shaker 24-36hr at 18C.
Day 3: Purify (~3.5 hours)
Pellet Cells (0.5hr)
Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 20 min in 50mL falcon tubes, discard supernatant
Cells can be stored in -20C until ready for purification
Lyse (0.5-1hr)
Add 1mL of lysis buffer, re-suspend, transfer to a 2mL eppindorf tube
Continue to incubate at room temperature for 20min, mixing with plate mixer
If worried about protein stability then incubate in cold room for 1hr on rocker
Pellet Insoluble Fraction (0.5-1hr)
Spin the lysis for 30-60min at 15000rpm (spin longer if supernatant is not clear, but 1hr should be plenty!)
Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube (~1800uL)
Filter (0.1hr)
Run supernatant through a 0.4micron filter to remove any remaning particules that would clog columns.
Bind Protein (0.5hr)
Add 100uL of NiNTA Agarose 50% slurry to each column (this is the Ni-beads)
Add 600uL of diH2O to each column
Spin 500rpm for 10s, discard flow through
Add 500uL of wash buffer, spin, discard flow through
Add 500uL of supernatant, spin, discard flow through
Repeat previous step until all supernatant has passed over column (~4x)
Wash Protein (0.5hr)
Add 500uL of wash buffer, spin, discard flow through
Elute Protein (0.2hr)
CHANGE TO FRESH COLLECTION TUBE
Add 200uL of elution buffer pipette up and down to mix the beads
Incubate for 2min the spin at 500rpm for 1min
THE FLOW THROUGH IS YOUR PURIFIED PROTEIN!
Recover the beads for re-use (~45min)
Extract beads using 200uL diH2O and transfer to 15mL falcon tube
Store columns in dry place for later use after thoroughly washed out with water. It is fine to just run tap water over the columns after beads have been removed
Spin down 800rpm for 5min, then decant supernatant
Fill falcon tube with 100mM EDTA, and re-suspend beads
Spin down 800rpm for 5min, then decant supernatant
Fill falcon tube with diH2O, and re-suspend beads
Spin down 800rpm for 5min, then decant supernatant
Fill falcon tube with 100mM NiSO4, and re-suspend beads
Spin down 800rpm for 5min, then decant supernatant
Fill falcon tube with diH2O, and re-suspend beads
Spin down 800rpm for 5min, then decant supernatant
Add 20% ethanol until a 50% slurry has been reached.
Store at 4C
