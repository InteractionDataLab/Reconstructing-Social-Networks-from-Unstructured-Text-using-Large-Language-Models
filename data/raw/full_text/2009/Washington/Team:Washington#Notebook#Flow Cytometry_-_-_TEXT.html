Flow Cytometry
Set up overnights of parts J36848-J36851 in terrific broth (TB). Let grow overnight at 37°C.
Dilute 20 μL overnight into 1 mL TB and grow at 37°C until OD 0.3 to OD 0.8.
Add IPTG to 1 mM concentration and let grow for minimum of four hours at room temperature (~23°C).
Record OD 600 and add equivalent of 1 μL of OD 2.0 cells to 1mL PBS with 1 mg/mL BSA and specified flourophore concentration (0-100 nM) and allow time to bind (30 minutes to 1 hour).
Preincubate second set of samples in 1 μM biotin to test for nonspecific binding of the fluorophore to the cells
Similarly incubate streptavidin-coated beads with fluorophore in PBS + BSA.
Record cytometry data with 100 μL of each sample.
Centrifuge samples, carefully pipette off supernatant to ~20 μL to avoid disturbing loose pellets, and resuspend samples in 1mL PBS + BSA
Spin beads at 1000 x g for 1 minute
Spin cells at 17,000 x g for 1 minute
Record cytometry data again with reduced fluorescence background
