You added biotin to your system and released your protein into the media.  Now all you have to do is spin down your sample to remove the cells, and your purified protein will be in the supernatant.
CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE YOUR PURIFIED PROTEIN.  IT'S TIME TO SING & DANCE, SING WITH ME!!!
We’re no strangers to love, You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of, You wouldnt get this from any other guy.
I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling, Gotta make you understand…
Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
We’ve known each other for so long Your heart’s been aching But you’re too shy to say it. Inside we both know what’s been going on, We know the game and we’re gonna play it.
Annnnnd if you ask me how I’m feeling, Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see…
Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Never gonna give you up, Never gonna let you down, Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry, Never gonna say goodbye, Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
Give you up. give you up. Give you up, give you up. Never gonna give Never gonna give, give you up. Never gonna give Never gonna give, give you up.
