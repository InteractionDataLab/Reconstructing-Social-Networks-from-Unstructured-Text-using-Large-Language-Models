Supernatant Protein Purification, 2mL
Inoculate 50mL culture of TB with ~750uL overnight culture
Grow a 37c until OD600: 0.4
Inoculate cells with IPTG so that the final concentration is 0.5mM (25uL of 1M IPTG for 50mL culture)
Grow cultures until OD600: 4, or use time points if looking for comparison in protein in supernatant
Prep NiNTA columns
Place micro-centrifuge columns in collection tubes
In micro-centrifuge columns add 200uL NiNTA beads
Add 500uL PBS, aspirate to thoroughly rinse columns
Spin columns with collection tubes for 30sec at 500rpm
Transfer 2mL of growing culture to eppendorf tube
Spin tube for 20min at 8000 rpm
Remove supernatant, carefully as to not disrupt the pellet and set aside
Bind Protein to column
Add 500uL supernatant to the column
Spin for 30sec at 500rpm
Discard flow through
Repeat 1-3 until all supernatant has run though the column
Wash column
Apply 500uL PBS to column, aspirate to suspend beads
Spin column for 30sec at 500rpm, discard flow through
Repeat 1-2
Elute protein off of column
Make PBS with 1mg/mL BSA and 100uM imidazole
Add 200uL PBS + 1mg/mL BSA + 100uM imidazole to column aspirate to mix beads
Let sit for 2 min
Place Column in clean collection tube
Spin column for 5min at 500rpm
FLOW THROUGH IS YOUR PURIFIED PROTEIN
