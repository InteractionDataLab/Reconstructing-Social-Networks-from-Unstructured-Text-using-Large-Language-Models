Miscellaneous
I'm a software developer on Microsoft Robotics team for the past 3 years, and was on various other teams at Microsoft for 2 years before that.
My educational background is in biophysics, with specific research work on properties of calcium dependant annexin proteins, and on simulation of cellular adhesion using stochastic finite state machines.
My current interests lie in robotics, and computational methods in genetic engineering and neuroscience.
