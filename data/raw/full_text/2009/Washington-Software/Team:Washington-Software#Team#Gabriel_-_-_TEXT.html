About Gabriel See
I am 11 years old and am officially a 7th Grader. However, I have a multi-tier education.
I am formally taking classes at the University of Washington in Mathematical Biology together with other Graduate Students and College Seniors as a non-matriculated student. I am also studying Electrodynamics (3rd year college physics) with my mentor, Dean Emeritus Ernest Henley .
I have spend my last 3 years at Eastlake High School , exhausted all AP level Math and Science courses, and received an AP Scholar with Distinction Award. This year, I am doing my 7th Grade at the Renaissance School of Arts and Reasoning taking Visual Arts (Drawing, Glass & other Medias), Performance Arts (Dance & Theatre), Language Arts and Social Studies.
Prior to working on iGEM, I have spent 3 years on the Eastlake HS Robotics Team, developing software for FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), FTC (FIRST Technical Competition) and Robothon. I have also spend my last 3 years self-studying upper division College Science Courses (Nuclear Physics, Genetics, Molecular Biology) and Graduate Level Applied Math (Nonlinear Dynamics, Chaos Theory, Stochastic Processes) with various mentors. My mentors include Professors, Postdoctoral Fellows, Instructors from Graduate School and Heads of Research Labs (Pathology and Biochemistry).
