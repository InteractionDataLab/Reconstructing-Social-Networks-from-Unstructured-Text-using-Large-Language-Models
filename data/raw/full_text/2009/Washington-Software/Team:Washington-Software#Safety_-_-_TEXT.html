Safety Questions
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Answers to Questions
None of our project ideas or materials raise safety issues since we did not use any biological materials, only proof-of-principle colored dyes to demonstrate that the robot works. In the future, this would change since DNA and possibly cells would be used. There is a biosafety group at our university, but since we only used Lego parts and other non-biological materials, safety was not an issue.
