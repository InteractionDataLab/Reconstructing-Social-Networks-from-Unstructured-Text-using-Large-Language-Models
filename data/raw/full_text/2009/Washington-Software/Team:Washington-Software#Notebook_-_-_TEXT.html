Video Notebook with Timeline
We kept a video notebook to track the progress of the project. At every major milestone, we made a video which records the date as well as a demonstration of the robot model. Prior to this successful version, we implemented two other robotic models, which failed.  We learned from the mistakes each time, and used the information learned to build a better robotic model. Here’s a brief comparison of the 3 models of BioBrick-A-Bot that was implemented, since Summer 2009.
