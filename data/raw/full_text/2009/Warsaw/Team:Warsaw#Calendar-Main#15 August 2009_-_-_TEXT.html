Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Gel-out of following sequences from the pSB1A3 plasmid:
p53 CDS
BBa_B0032 + BBa_C0040
BBa_R0080
BBa_E0032
Methods:
Gel-outs were prepared according to manufacturer's manual
Results:
Evaluation of gel-outs yield
Comment:
Some purification were unsuccessful because time required to efficacious activation of the columns is, in fact longer than few minutes (which is not depicted in the manual). It is obligated to repeat digestion and gel-out for the samples which were not isolated
Task 2:
Ligation of following constructs:
p53 CDS to BBa_B0032 on pSB1A3 plasmid
BBa_C0040 to BBa_R0080 on pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
Ligation mix:
1.0 μl - T4 ligase 2.5 μl - Tango buffer (Fermentas, 10x) 3.0 μl - dNTPs (EURx, 5μlM) 6.0 μl - digested vector 12.5 μl - digested insert
Ligation time - overnight
Task 3:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of following plasmids:
BBa_E0022 with BBa_B0032 on pSB1A3 plasmid
backbone plasmid pSB1A3
Task 4:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain TOP10 to reveal the quality of prepared bacteria
Plasmid to transform: pSB1A3
Methods:
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here .
