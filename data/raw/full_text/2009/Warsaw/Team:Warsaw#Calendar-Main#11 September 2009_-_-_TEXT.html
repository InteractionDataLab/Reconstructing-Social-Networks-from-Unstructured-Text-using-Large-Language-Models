Assembly of fusion proteins
Marcin
Task 1: Prepare the ligation of PCR-amplified signal peptide with pKSII cloning vector Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
11 μl amplified signal peptide CDS (previously phosphorylated via PNK) 7 μl vector 1 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas) 2.5 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM) 2.5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 2 μl PEG 4500 (Fermentas)
Ligation was carried out 12 hours in 16 °C. After mixture was thermally inactivated
Task 2: Transformation of TOP10 chemocompetent bacteria with mitochondial signal peptide CDS
Methods:
Ligation mixture was thermally inactivated
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
