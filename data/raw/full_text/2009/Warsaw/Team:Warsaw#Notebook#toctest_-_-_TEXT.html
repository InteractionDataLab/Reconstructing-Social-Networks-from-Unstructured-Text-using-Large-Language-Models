Lab work - detailed plan and its execution
My idea is....
Here should be placed sth like schema describing what are we doing, step by step...
Brainstorming and project chosing
Reading, reading, modifying, reading, thinking, reading :)
Preparing first outline of the project, together with raising funds for preliminary costs (registration fee, essential lab supplies etc.)
Improving project description (reading, modifying, beer drinking :D, etc)
Looking for sources of the biological material (genomic DNA of Salmonella and Yersinia, secretion sytem, cell lines, plasmids etc.)
First attempts to wet work - PCRs and further cloning of parts, which we cannot get from the Registry)
When Parts Distribution is available - isolation of required parts and further cloning
Testing of bacteria strains to choose the best for optimal work of the whole system
Building of operons, step by step
Testing and measuring of promoters (especially the promoter of the mgtc gene) and other parts (listeriolysin etc)
Testing of whole devices, operons and whole system
Description of final results, preparation of final wiki, poster and presentation
Jamboree!!
Table of contents of our wet work could be also prepared as a part of bigger graphical schema - then it's easier to understand each step of the project. It could be 'attached' to the 'big schema' (described above) or it could be modified schema describing our whole system (from the Project page). What I'm pretty sure - it should be in graphical form and I would  be grateful if someone would like to make it.
I'm open for other ideas. If any will come... And if real work will come after these ideas...
