Cloning of cro gene into pSB+ vector
Kama
chemocompetent E. coli TOP10 were incubated on ice for 15 minutes
20μl of ligation mixture was added
bacteria were incubated with DNA on ice for 30 minutes
heat shock was conducted (1min30sec 42°C)
bacteria were incubated on ice for 3 minutes
After the heat shock 780μl of SOB medium was added
Mixture with bacteria was incubated for 1 hour in 37°C
100μl of mixture was plated on medium containing ampicillin, X-Gal and IPTG (diluted 10* and without dilution)

Task 1:
Digest plasmids isolated in 13.09.2009 to reveal the identity of the constructs
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
2 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 15 μl MQ water
Digestion was carry out 2 hours
Results: There is no evidence for occurence of signal peptide CDS. The situation of BBa_K177037 biobricks is unclear since lack of expected restriction pattern
Comment:
Because of short length of signal peptide it is possible that I am incapable of finding this fragment on the gel. I think the sequencing of some samples may reveal the identity of the both signal peptide and BBa_K177037
Task 2:
Comment:
Due to some problem which our ampicilline I decided to use vector with resistance to kanamycine instead of previously use pSB1A3
Prepare the backbone plasmid pSB1K3 to ligation with COX mitochondrial signal.
Reaction mixture composition:
20 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 1 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 23 μl MQ water
Digestion was carry out 4 hours
Result:
The digestion was severe incomplete. Most of DNA was uncut. It is obligated to carry out the reaction longer.
