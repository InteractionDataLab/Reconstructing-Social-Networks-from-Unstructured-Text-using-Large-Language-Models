Amplyfing of Bax sequence
Justyna
Methods
PCR reaction mix:
per 50μl:
5.0 μl - 10 x buffer (20mM MgSO4) 3.5 μl - dNTP mix (5mM) 3.0 μl - primer BaxF (0.5 μM) 3.0 μl - primer BaxR2 (0.5 μM) 1.0 μl - template DNA 32.0μl - mQ water 2.5 μl - Yellow PfuPlus DNA polymerase (1U/μl)
Template DNA in 3 dilutions - 101 (pure plasmid DNA), 10-1 and 10-2.
buffer, dNTP mix and polymerase from EURx.
DNA template - human Bax with changed codons to be more efficient in yeast.
Thermal cycling conditions for PCR (~7-8 kb):
94°C, 1 min 0s  94°C, 0 min 15s 69°C-74°C, 0 min 30s 68°C, 1 min 0s cycles 1-10  94°C, 0 min 15s 69°C-74°C, 0 min 30s 68°C, 1 min 20s cycles 11-25  68°C, 7 min 0s 4°C, indefinite
Results:
Best reaction for 101 and 10-1 (more specific), in 69.1°C and 69.8°C.
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Reamplification of the mgtc promoter
Methods:
The PCR mix was prepared as follows:
5μl buffer B (EURx)
2μl 5mM dNTPs (EURx)
5μl forward starter
5μl reverse starter
2μl OptiTaq polymerase (EURx)
2μl matrix
29 μl H2O
PCR programme:
4min 95°C
(30s 95°C, 35s 58°C, 40s 72°C)x28
10min 72°C
~ 4°C
The results were visualised with gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.
The appropriate bands were extracted using Gel-Out kit (A&A Biotechnology) according to the producers protocol.
Results:
Gel Electrophoresis:
From left:
GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix #SM0333 (Fermentas)
50μl of PCR mix
50μl of PCR mix
Negative control
Conclusions:
Reamplification was successful.
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Gel-out of samples which was cut out from the gel in 12.08.09
Procedure:
Fragments of agarose gel were carefully cut out and in the next step DNA was extracted from the gel using the A&A gel-out kit. Detailed procedure is described here
Results:
Evaluation of gel-outs yield
Comment:
The concentration of DNA is sample containing BBa_R0080 was surprisingly low (sample 1). Because of this I decided to repeat the digest and try to use another gel-out kit.
Task 2:
Restriction digest of BBa_B0032
Methods:
Digest of BBa_R0080 using SpeI and PstI
Reaction mixture composition:
20 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 24 μl MQ water
Task 3:
Cloning the sequences: cro CDS and BBa_E0022 with BBa_B0032 vector
Methods:
Ligation mixtures composition:
15 μl digested cro (or E0022)  8 μl digested vector  3 μl Tango buffer(Fermentas) 3 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas)
Duration of ligation was about 18 hours; reaction was conducted in 19 °c (approximately).
In the next step ligated samples were thermally inactivated via heating in 80 °c for 20 minutes
Task 4:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of on pSB1A3 plasmid containing:
p53
BBa_B0032 + BBa_C0040
BBa_B0032 + BBa_C0051
BBa_B0032 + BBa_E0032
