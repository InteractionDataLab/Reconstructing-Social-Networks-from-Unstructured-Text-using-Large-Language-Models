Creating devices to test promoters in E. coli strains (devices BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 )
Franek
Tasks:
Selecting clones with BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025
Methods:
Tranformants with BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 clones were recognised due to the fluorescence under UV light.
4 positive BBa_K177024 , and 16 BBa_K177025 were found.
Each clone was transferred to new plate with LB, agar-agar and IPTG or 0.2 % arabinose. Liquid cultures were also established.
Results:
BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 were successfully created!
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
A 200μl batch of chemocompetent bacteria was transformed with 15μl of ligation mix and incubated overnight on petri dishes   containing LB medium supplemented with ampicilin, X-gal and IPTG.
Results:
The transformation yielded only a couple of blue colonies.
Conclusions:
The transformation needs to be redone, this time using more of the ligation mix.
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Isolate plasmids containing the biobricks
Methods:
Plasmids weren isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here .
After the isolation 1 ul of each plasmid solution was diluted to 10 ul and loaded into the 1% agarose gel
Electrophoresis condition:
voltage - 70V
time - 30 min
Next the gel was photographed:
Samples of plasmids after isolation
Legend:
1-3 - BBa_B0032
4-6 - BBa_c0040
7-9 - BBa_C0051
10-12 - BBa_E0032
Comment:
Isolation of plasmids was successful.
Cloning of p53 coding sequence
Marcin
Task:
Cloning p53 coding sequence to pKS plasmid
Methods:
Ligation mixture composition:
14 μl digested p53  1.5 μl digested pKS 5 μl ligation buffer (Invitrogen) 1 μl ligase T4
Duration of ligation was about 20 hours; reaction was conducted in 16 °C (approximately).
Insertion of the pho gene into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kama
Isolation of plasmid containing an insert was performed with the A&A plasmid mini kit
Notes
All samples contain empty plasmid
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Electrophoresis, gel extraction and ligation of:
BBa_C0012 - lacI repressor on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid (XbaI/PstI = prospective insert)
BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid (SpeI/PstI = prospective  vector)
