Team meeting
presentations of work did by both groups during last week (given by Ania and Kuba)
presentation of methods used by teams starting in previous editions of iGEM to kill bacteria :) (Kamil)
presentation of different methods of targeting drugs to cancer cells (Marcin)
We've been also talking about some organization issues and we've decided to move our meetings - now they will take place every Thursady at 17:00, one week at the Faculty of Biology Building, another week in the room E of the lab on Pawinskiego Street.
Creating devices to test promoters in E. coli strains (devices BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 )
Franek
Tasks:
Alkaline lysis of the plasmid containing BBa_B0024 terminator
Methods:
PlasmidMini set by A&A Biotechnology was used. 2 test tubes with 5ml LB and ampicillin were first inoculated with colonies containing BBa_B0024 brick on pSB1A2 plasmid. The cultures were incubated for 6h at 37°C. Alkaline lysis was performed on both cultures. The pellet from 5 ml of bacteria was used.
Results:
Concentration of DNA sample was measured using NanoDrop ND-1000
DNA sample
DNA concentration in ng/µl
BBa_B0024
33.82
Notes:
Plates with BBa_I0500 transformants were empty once again. This result, together with note in part description suggest that this part is damaged
Making of RBS-cI part
Jarek
Task:
Digestion of parts BBa_C0051 and BBa_B0032
Electrophoretic separation of digested parts
Isolation of DNA samples from gel
Ligation of part C0051 to the vector with B0032
Methods:
DNA samples were digesteg with 1 µl of PstI/BcuI (B0032) or PstI/XbaI (C0051) in 1xTango buffer for 3 hours.
After digestion they were separated on 0,8% agarose gel.
Isolation of sample from gel was performed with the A&A "Gel-out" kit .
For ligation 4µl of ligase buffer and 2 µl of ligase were used.
Results:
Cloning of p53 coding sequence
Marcin
Comment:
Due to problem with low quality of PCR product it was necessary to transform bacteria with plasmid containing p53 sequence and to perform all procedures once more time.
Tasks:
Transformation of chemocompetent strain of E. coli by plasmid containing p53 sequence
Procedure:
The protocol of transformation has not been changed, except of giving 1 µl of plasmid solution to the bacteria. If you want to see detailed procedure go here
Bacteria was plated on the medium containing kanamycin
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Competent cells were transformed with LacI C0012 taken out of the distribution 2009 Kit Plate 1 well 20.
Isolation of BioBricks from 2008 and 2009 Kit Plates
Monika
Tasks:
Isolate plasmids containing the biobricks - continuation
GFP coding device switched on by IPTG - BBa_I763004 from 2008 Kit Plate 1017 well G5
promoter lambda (cI regulated) with RFP reporter BBa_I763007 from 2009 Kit Plate 1 well 15J
GFP generator - BBa_E0840 from 2009 Kit Plate 1 well 12O
GFP generator - BBa_J07037 from 2009 Kit Plate 1 well 12O
Results from 9 July 2009
all transformations exept GFP coding device switched on by IPTG (BBa_I763004) were successful
Methods:
Planting on LB medium supplemented with apropriate antibiotic, 6h incubation in 37°C
Planting on LB-agar medium supplemented with apropriate antibiotic
Alkaline lysis (prodedure described here )
Results
Concentration of DNA sample was measured using NanoDrop ND-1000
DNA sample
DNA concentration in ng/µl
BBa_I763007
12.63 and 17.95
BBa_E0840
34.91 and 25.66
BBa_J07037
12.52 and 48.68
Comment
Isolations where DNA concentration is under 30ng/µl must be repeated
