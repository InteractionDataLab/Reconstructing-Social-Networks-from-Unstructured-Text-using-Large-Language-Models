Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Gel-outs of following constructs digested on 17.08.09:
p53 CDS on pSB1A3 plasmid
BBa_R0080 on pSB1A3 plasmid
BBa_E0010 on pSB1A3 plasmid
BBa_C0040 with RBS on pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
All samples were inactivated via heating in 80 °C for 20 minutes
All gel-outs were performed using the EurX gel-out kit according to the manual
Results:
All gel-outs (except C0040 with RBS) were successful. One isolation failed because of very low DNA concentration
Task 2:
Digest pKSII plasmid with cro CDS
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
45 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.5 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas)
Task 3:
Ligate p53 CDS to pSB1A3 plasmid with BBa_B0032
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl p53 CDS 7 μl vector 2.3 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 3 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX) 1 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas)
Ligation was performed for about 9 hours and it was subsequently thermally inactivated
Making of plac-RBS-llo part
Jarek
Tasks:
Preparation of 20 liquid cultures, from colonies that grew from ligation, in 3 ml of LB+Amp nad incubating them in 37C degree
Cloning switch 1 regulatory parts [ K177012 -PcI.RBS.LacI, K177033 -PcI.RBS.LacI.PcI.RBS.RFP.terminator, K177011 -PLacI.RBS.cI.terminator, K177038 -PLacI.RBS.cI.terminator.PLacI.RBS.GFP.terminator ] into two compatible low copy number plasmids of different antibiotic resistance
