Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Digest of isolate plasmids with ligated biobricks to verify the success of ligation
Methods:
Digest of isolate plasmids using XbaI and PstI
Reaction mixture composition:
0.5 μl purified plasmid DNA product  0.5 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.5 μl PstI (Fermentas)  2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas)  16.5 μl MQ water
The reaction was performed three hours and it was subsequently inactivated via heating in 80°C for 20 minutes.
In the next step reaction mixtures were loaded into the agarose gel to analize restriction pattern of the plasmids
Comment:
All isolated plasmids have not insert. The cloning must be performed another time
Task 2:
Restriction digest of biobricks
Comment:
Due to obtain set of biobricks which each of them contain RBS and particular coding sequence some of biobricks were digested:
BBa_B0032
BBa_c0040
BBa_C0051
BBa_E0032
Methods:
Digest of BBa_B0032 using SpeI and PstI
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl purified plasmid DNA product  0.5 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas)  5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas)  34 μl MQ water
Digest of other biobricks using PstI and XbaI
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl purified plasmid DNA product  1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas)  5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas)  34 μl MQ water
Both reaction were performed approximately 7 hours they were subsequently inactivated via heating in 80°C for 20 minutes
Task 3:
Ligations of biobricks
Methods:
Ligation mixture composition:
8 μl digested plasmid with RBS  9 μl digested CDS  2 μl ligation buffer (Fermentas, PEG4000 have been added previously)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas)
Negative control mixture composition:  8 μl digested plasmid with RBS  2 μl ligation buffer (Fermentas, PEG4000 have been added previously)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas)  9 μl MQ water
Duration of ligation was about 12 hours
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Gel electrophoresis of the obtained clones.
Repeat the ligation of the PcI and  RBs.3LacI parts.
Results:
Only small amount of DNA visible on the gel in 4 samples out of 20. Probably plasmid isolation has been done using too old solution 2. The visible DNA fragments are not the correct clone.
