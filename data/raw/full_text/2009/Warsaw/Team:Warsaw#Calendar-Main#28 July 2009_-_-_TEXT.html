Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Plasmid assembly
Methods:
The plasmid digest mix was prepared as follows:
4μl purified plasmid  2μl Tango buffer (Fermentas)  1μl SpeI enzyme  1μl XbaI enzyme
The solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20μl.
The mgtc promoter digest mix was prepared as follows:
10μl purified promoter  2μl Tango buffer (Fermentas)  1μl SpeI enzyme  1μl XbaI enzyme
The solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20μl.
The digest was carried out in 37°C for 3h. and then inactivated in 80°C for 20min.
The digested plasmid was separated on 1% agarose gel.
The plasmid backbone was extracted from agarose gel using the GelOut kit (A&A Biotechnology) accrding to the manufacturers protocol (in the total volume of 50μl).
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
50μl purified backbone  20μl digested promoter  8μl T4 ligase buffer (Fermentas)  2μl T4 ligase (Fermentas)
The ligation was carried out in 18°C overnight.
