Gradient PCR PhoP/PhoQ
Kama
Tasks:
Amplification of phoP/phoQ
Methods:
PCR mixture's composition:
1μl Pfu buffer (EURX)  0,25μl primer phoPF 0,25μl primer phoQR  0,5μl dNTPs (10 mM) 0,25μl Pfu turbo polymerase (EURX) 0,5μl template DNA from Salmonella (unknown strain) 0,75μl DMSO  The solution was topped up with H2O to 10μl.
PCR programs:

Results:
Will be seen tomorow
Assembly of endosome detection operon
Marcin
Task 1: Gel-out of the following biobricks (digested in 22.09.09):
BBa_K177035 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177035 - PstI, XbaI
BBa_K177036 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177044 - PstI, XbaI
Methods:
All gel-outs were performed using the A&A kit according to the manual
Task 2: Prepare the following ligations:
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177036 to obtain BBa_K177037
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177043 to obtain BBa_K177044
Methods
Reaction mixtures composition:
11 μl insert 7 μl vector 1 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas) 2.4 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 2.5 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM)
Ligation was carried out 10 hours in 16 °C. Subsequently mixtures were thermally inactivated
Task 3: Transformation of TOP10 chemocompetent bacteria with following constructs:
BBa_K177044
BBa_K177037
Methods:
Ligation mixture was thermally inactivated
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
