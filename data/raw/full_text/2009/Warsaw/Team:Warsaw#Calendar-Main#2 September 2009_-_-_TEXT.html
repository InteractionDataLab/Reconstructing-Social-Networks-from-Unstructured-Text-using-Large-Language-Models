Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Restriction digest of followed costruct: BBa_K177037 from the pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
1. μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas)  2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 15 μl MQ water
Digest was performed about six hours and subsequently thermal inactivated
Results
All isolated plasmids have no insert
Task 2:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of on pSB1A3 plasmid containing BBa_K177035
Acquiring the internaline A gene from Listeria monocytogenes st. EDG-e genome
Jarek
Tasks:
Preparation of PCR reaction with L.monocytogenes st. EGD-e genome DNA
Separation of PCR products on the 0,8% agarose gel
Acquiring the pure DNA sample from PCR reaction with Clean-Up kit
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Colonies transfer
Liquid cultures establishment
Methods:
Appropriate colonies (both of them) were transferred to a new plate containing ampicilin
Liquid cultures were established in 5 ml LB medium supplemented with ampicilin and incubated overnight with areation
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Colonies transfer
Liquid cultures establishment
Methods:
Appropriate colonies (all 7 of them) were transferred to a new plate containing ampicilin
Liquid cultures were established in 5 ml LB medium supplemented with ampicilin and incubated overnight with areation
Cloning switch 1 regulatory parts [ K177012 -PcI.RBS.LacI, K177033 -PcI.RBS.LacI.PcI.RBS.RFP.terminator, K177011 -PLacI.RBS.cI.terminator, K177038 -PLacI.RBS.cI.terminator.PLacI.RBS.GFP.terminator ] into two compatible low copy number plasmids of different antibiotic resistance
