Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
A 200μl batch o chemocompetent bacteria was transformed according to the protocol with 15μl of ligation mix.
1x and 10x (100μl each) concentrations of bacteria were incubated on Petri dishes containing LB broth and ampicilin.
The bacteria were incubated overnight at 37°C.
Results:
Both dishes yielded considerable amounts of white colonies (pSB1A3 has a white/red selection)
Conclusions:
The ligation seems to be successful.
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Digest the only only one promising clone obtained with SchI and PstI to confirm the sequence
Results:
Comments:
The obtained fragments are of the wrong size. The clone is not correct.
