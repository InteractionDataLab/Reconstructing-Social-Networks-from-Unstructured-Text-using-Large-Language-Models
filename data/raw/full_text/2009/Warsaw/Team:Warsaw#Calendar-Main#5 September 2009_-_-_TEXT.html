Acquiring the internaline A gene from Listeria monocytogenes st. EDG-e genome
Jarek
Tasks:
Electrophoretical segregation of PCR products from previous day in 0,8% agarosis gel
Preparation of another PCR reaction with L.monocytogenes genome DNA
Results:
I propably took the wrong genome DNA sample for the previous reaction, there are products but none of them has the correct length.
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of following constructs:
pSB1A3 plasmid containing cro coding sequence
pSB1A3 plasmid containing Bax coding sequence
Task 2:
Isolate the plasmids containing previously described constructs
Methods: Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Task 3:
Digest previously isolated plasmids and verify the correctness of the ligation:
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
2 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.5 μl PstI (Fermentas) 2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 15 μl MQ water
Digest was performed 90 minutes
Results:
Comments:
All samples of cro CDS on pSB1A3 are only empty plasmids
Samples of Bax CDS have biobricks but I am unable to determine whether this biobricks is Bax CDS or BBa_E0010 due to contamination with the latter one. It is obligated to prepare another digestion to reveal the identity of the insert
Bistable switch 1 testing
