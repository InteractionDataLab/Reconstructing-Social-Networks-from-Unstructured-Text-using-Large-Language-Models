Welcome to the official iGEM 2009 Warsaw Team website. In this year iGEM our team is working on project which aim is to prepare a novel, bacteria-based vector for delivery of DNA and proteins to the cytoplasm of cancer cells. More details can be found in the Project part of this website.
Project progress:
66,6% (The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet). Unfortunately we didn't manage to finish all steps of our project, although we are really close. More details can be found in the results page.
