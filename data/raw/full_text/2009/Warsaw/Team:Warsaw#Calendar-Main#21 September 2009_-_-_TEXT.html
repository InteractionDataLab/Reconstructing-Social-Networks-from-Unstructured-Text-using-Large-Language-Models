Assembly of endosome detection operon
Marcin
Task 1: Isolation of pSB1A3 plasmid containing BBa_K177044
Methods:
Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Task 2: Restriction digest of previously isolated plasmids:
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
3 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas)  2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 13 μl MQ water
Reactions were carried out 2 hour
Results:
Some sequences 1500 bp length are visible on the gel but I need to determine whether it is expected product or contamination (bacteria containing plasmid with listeriolysin were also presented on the same plate)
Task 3: PCR reaction to determine the identity of isolated (Task 1) DNA
Commment:
I decided to perform PCR reaction using primers for listeriolysin. If the plasmids contain BBa_K177044 there will be no PCR product.
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
0.1 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1.4 μl Opti Taq Polymerase (EURx) 1 μl dNTPs (EURx) 2 μl Opti Taq Buffer (Fermentas) 15.5 μl MQ water
Results:
All isolated plasmid contain listeriolysin. It is necessary to carry out ligation one more time
Task 4:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli TOP10 strain
Construct to transform:
BBa_K177044
Methods:
Ligation mixture was thermally inactivated in 80 °C for 20 minutes
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Selection of the colonies
Methods:
The appropriate colonies were transferred to a fresh agarose plate and liquid cultures were established.
The plate and the liquid cultures were incubated overnight in 37°C
