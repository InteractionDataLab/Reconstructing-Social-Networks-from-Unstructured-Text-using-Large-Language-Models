Assembly of endosome detection operon
Marcin
Task 1: Prepare the following ligations:
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177036 to obtain BBa_K177037
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177043 to obtain BBa_K177044
Methods:
Reaction mixtures composition:
45 μl mixture of insert and vector DNA (both are purified at the same probe) 1.5 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas) 5 μl Ligase Buffer (Fermentas)
Ligation was carried out 20 hours in 16 °C.
Task 2: Transformation of TOP10 chemocompetent bacteria with following constructs:
BBa_K177044
BBa_K177037
Methods:
Ligation mixture was thermally inactivated
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
Comment:
All performed ligation were unsuccessful. I am afraid that the effectivity of our gel-out kit may be lower than is expected. Someone must find it out.
PCR of phoQ
Monika
Task:
amplification of phoQ (1464 bp)
Methods:
PCR mixture:
5μl Pfu polymerase buffer  1μl forward primer and 1μl reverse primer  2μl dNTPs (10 mM)  2,5μl Pfu turbo polymerase (EURX)  2μl template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2  The solution was topped up with H2O to 10μl    contol - no template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2
PCR conditions:
1. 3min 95°C    2. 30s 95°C    3. 35s 58°C    4. 2min 10 s 72°C    5. go to step 2, 2 times    6. 30s 95°C    7. 30s 68°C    8. 2min 10s 72°C    9. go to step 6, 28 times    10. 10min 72°C     11. forever 4°C
Results of PCR:
Will be seen tomorrow
