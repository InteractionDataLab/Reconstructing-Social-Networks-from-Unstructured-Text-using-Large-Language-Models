Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Reamplification of the mgtc promoter
Methods:
The PCR mix was prepared as follows:
5μl buffer B (EURx)  2μl 5mM dNTPs (EURx) 5μl forward starter  5μl reverse starter  2μl OptiTaq polymerase (EURx)
The solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 50μl.
PCR programme:
4min 95°C
(30s 95°C, 35s 58°C, 40s 72°C)x28
10min 72°C
~ 4°C
The results were visualised with gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.
Results:
Gel Electrophoresis:
From left:
GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix #SM0333 (Fermentas)
5μl of PCR mix
Conclusions:
[Borat]Great success![/Borat]
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of plasmids containing ligated biobricks
Preparation of bacterial cultures
Prepare LB medium with kanamycin
Add 3.5 ml of the medium to the probes
Add one bacterial colony to each probe
Breed the bacteria about 7 hours
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
extract plasmid, digest with EcoRI and PstI, gel electrophoresis
set up liquid culture from cells transformed with repeated ligation, extract plasmid, digest with EcoRI and PstI, gel electrophoresis.
Construction of RBS.3-listeriolysin
Ania
Tasks:
Digest vector with RBS.3 with SpeI and PstI
Digest llo(wild type) and llo mutated with with XbaI and PstI
Extract the correct fragments from the gel
Set up a ligation of RBS.3 and wild type llo (since the mutated version turned out not to be correct one)
Results:
Comments:
The RBS.3 and wild type listeriolysin are correctly digested, the mutated listeriolysin is not digested, sequencing confirmed that we did not have the correct vesrion of mutated listeriolysin.
