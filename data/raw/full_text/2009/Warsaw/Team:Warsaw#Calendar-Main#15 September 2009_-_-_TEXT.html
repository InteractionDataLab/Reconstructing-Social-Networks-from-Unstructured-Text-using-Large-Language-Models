Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
PCR product digest
Methods:
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
40μl plasmid isolation
5μl Buffer O (Fermentas)
1μl EcoRI enzyme
1μl PstI enzyme
3μl H2O
The digest was carried out in 37°C overnight and inactivated for 15 min. in 80°C.
The product was later purified using the Montage PCR Centrifugal Filter Device.
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Creation of the cro-box double stranded DNA
Cro-box digest
Methods:
The mixture of equal volumes (10μl) of both ssDNA was heated to 94°C for 15min. and left to cool.
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
20μl plasmid isolation
3μl Tango Buffer (Fermentas)
1μl XbaI enzyme
1μl PstI enzyme
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out in 37°C overnight and inactivated for 15 min. in 80°C.
The product was later purified with dialysis.
Assembly of fusion proteins
Marcin
Task 1: Dialysis of PCR-amplified COX signal peptide
Comment:
Typical purification methods such as usage of gel-out are useless in the case of small fragments of DNA. It is the reason why I chose dialysis to purify the PCR product.
Methods:
Dialysis were perform one hour
After dialysis samples were elecrophoretically separated to investigate the identity and amount of DNA.
Results:
Task 2: Prepare the backbone plasmid pSB1K3 and COX mitochondrial signal to ligate them
Reaction mixture composition:
20 μl purified plasmid DNA product (or PCR-amplified signal peptide) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 1 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 23 μl MQ water
Digestion was carry out 7 hours
Results:
Kanamycine-resistant plasmid must have been mistaken with some other construct because no biobrick is cut and the length of the plasmid is longer than expected. I decided to use pSB1A3 .
Task 3: Ligation of mitochondrial signal peptide with pSB1A3
Reaction mixture composition:
8 μl purified plasmid DNA product (or PCR-amplified signal peptide) 10 μl purified PCR product 2.5 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM) 2.5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas)
Ligation was carry out 15 hours
