Becoming a sponsor
Why should you be interested?
Our project, as it is the students idea from the beginning to the end, is supported through sponsorship of institutions or people of good will. Without any support we couldn't exist and conduct our research
We believe that the result of our project - standarized E. coli able to come into and secret some proteins inside the eucaryotic cell will have therapeutic (or similar) applications. It's a great opportunity for you to support such exciting project!
You will also support the Synthetic Biology which has the potential to change science research in many profound ways. Everyone involved in the science industry including sponsors have everything to gain.
You have also a great opportunity to support science education and undergraduate research. We have a great group of young scientists who are fascinated with synthetic and molecular biology. We are working on a great and demanding project, practicing our skills in the lab group work. Who knows, maybe some of us will develop to be great scientists or become the best employees of your institution?
What could be donated and sponsored?
Lab Supplies. We need various lab supplies and equipment.
Trip to the iGEM Jamboree, which is the culminating iGEM event in October. During the Jamboree we will present our results and get to know the final results. Sponsors could pay for flight tickets, hotel stay or the attendance fee.
Student Expenses. We are spending the summer in Warsaw, paying by ourselves for living expenses. Sponsorship could be used to help pay for the basic student expenses such as housing and food.
What are benefits of becoming a sponsor?
Every sponsorship will be appreciated by all members of our team. If you decide to support us, we will put information obout you on this website, your logo on our t-shirts and in our presentations and posters. Support higher than 5000 Euro will make you our strategic sponsor.
Contact
If you are interested in our project and want to support us, feel free to contact us at igem2009.warsaw@gmail.com or directly with Pawel . We are ready to answer any questions and see any comments or potential sponsorship requests. Thank you!
