Creation of the cro-box testing devices
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation of the device with two variants of the cro-box
Bacteria transformation
I14018 brick resurrection
R0010 brick multiplication
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows (same for both variants):
20μl purified cro-box plasmid
20mu;l purified reporter device
5μl ligation buffer (Fermentas)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
4μl H2O
A fresh bach o chemocompetent bacteria was transformed with the ligation mixtures and incubated overnight on agarose plates supplemented with ampicillin.
A fresh bach o chemocompetent bacteria was transformed with the I14018 brick solution and incubated overnight on agarose plates supplemented with kanamycin.
Bacterial culture carrying the Roo10 brick was resuspended in 50ml of liquid LB medium suplemented with ampicillin and incubated overnight.
Mutagenesis of cI
Kuba
Task: Obtain a functional, termosensitive version of cI
Results: The colonies obtained from the mutagenesis of the bistable switch created three distinc populations, demonstrating the succes of mutagenesis, as well as suggesting, that more than one point mutation was obtained (later verified by sequencing; vide: https://2009.igem.org/Team:Warsaw/results#Experimental_results )
