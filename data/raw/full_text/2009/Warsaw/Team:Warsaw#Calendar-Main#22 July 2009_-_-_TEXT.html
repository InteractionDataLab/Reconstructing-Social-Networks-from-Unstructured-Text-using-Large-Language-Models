Assembly of invasion operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Prepare chemocompetent bacteria
Detailed protocol
Incubate 100 ml of liquid bacterial culture until the OD value is 0.55 or little more
Incubate the bacteria on the ice for 15 minutes
Centrifuge the bacteria at 4°C for 15 minutes
Remove the supernatant and add 10 ml of 0.1 M solution of CaCl2
Gently suspend the bacterial pellet and incubate the bacteria on the ice for 45 minutes
Centrifuge the bacteria at 4°C for 15 minutes
Remove the supernatant and add 2 to 5 ml of 0.1 M solution of CaCl2
Prepate the aliquots of suspended bacteria which contain 100 μl of the solution
Store the bacteria in -80°C
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain DH5α
Methods:
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here . The only modification is usage of total volume of ligation mixture prepared 20.07.09
petri dish were hold in 37°C for 16 hours
Cloning of p53 coding sequence
Marcin
Task 1:
Cloning p53 coding sequence to pKS plasmid
Methods:
Ligation mixture composition:
10 μl digested p53  25 μl digested pKS  5 μl ligation buffer (Fermentas) 8 μl MQ water 2 μl ligase T4
Duration of ligation was about 7 hours; reaction was conducted in 16 °c (approximately).
Task 2:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain DH5α
Methods:
Ligation reaction was stopped via thermal inactivation in 80°C for 20 minutes
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here . The only modification is usage of half volume of ligation mixture prepared today
Isolation of BioBricks from 2008 and 2009 Kit Plates
Sebastian
Task 1:
Digest of following parts
BBa_B0032
BBa_C0040
BBa_C0051
BBa_E0032
Methods:
Digest of BBa_C0040, BBa_C0051 and BBa_E0032 with PstI/XbaI and BBa_B0032 with PstI/SpeI
Reaction mixture (BBa_C0040, BBa_C0051 and BBa_E0032):
10ul of plasmid  1ul of each enzyme  5ul of Fermentas Tango Yellow buffer  33ul H2O
Reaction mixture (BBa_B0032):
5ul of plasmid  0,5ul of each enzyme 2,5ul of Fermentas Tango Yellow buffer 16ul H2O
Time of digest - 6h
Task 2:
Electrophoresis and gel-out
Methods:
Electrophoresis of all samples volume
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2009/a/ab/Trawienia22-07.JPG
Order of samples: (1,2) BBa_E0032, (3,4) BBa_C0051, (5) generuler DNA Mix, (6,8,9) BBa_C0040, (7) BBa_B0032
Gel-out of samples with A&A Biotechnology Kit
Electrophoresis of the samples after Gel-out
https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2009/8/8a/Gel-out.JPG
Order of samples: BBa_B0032, BBa_C0040, BBa_C0051, BBa_E0032, generuler DNA mix
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Transformation verification
Methods:
In order to save on resources colonies that potentially contain the mgtc promoter (the white ones) were marked and the entire dish returned to 37°C for the next 24h.
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Gel extraction of BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid and gel extracion of - lacI repressor
