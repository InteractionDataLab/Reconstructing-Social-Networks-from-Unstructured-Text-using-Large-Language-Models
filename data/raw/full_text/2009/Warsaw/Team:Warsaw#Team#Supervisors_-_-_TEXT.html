prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki
Education
MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975  PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981  Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995 Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996  Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Scholarships:
Germany , 1984, University of Tuebingen, 10 months
Germany, 1985, Max Planck Institute, 8 months
USA, 1989, University of Pennsylvania post doc, 2,5 years

Research interests:
Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).  LLO is a 58 kDa sulphydryl-activated, pore-forming cytotoxin which allows L. monocytogenes to escape from the phagocytic vesicle in macrophage and causes actin cytoskeleton reorganization in infected cells. LLO- mutants are much less virulent and do not survive in macrophages.

1971-1976  Research Assistant at the Department of Genetics, University of Warsaw. Studies              on genetics of sulphur metabolism and amino acid transport in Aspergillus.
Research interests:
Regulation of gene expression in mitochondria is achieved mainly by controlling stability of mRNA and its decay rate. Nuclear encoded proteins participate in polyadenylation of mitochondrial transcripts and in their subsequent degradation. At present I work on four human genes involved in these processes : polyA polymerase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, RNA helicase and RNase II.  Three of them have been characterized for the first time in my lab.
Two of the proteins seem to play additional important roles in aging and cancer. To study this, my research plans involve employing various techniques of molecular biology, proteomics and transgenic animal models.
Personal:
married, two children
hobbys: opera, antique textiles
Michał Lower
I come from Warsaw, our capital city :-). I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Virology was about new method of rapid determination of type III DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences. Apart from molecular biology I'm passionated with computer programming.
Paweł Krawczyk
I come from small village in the south of Poland  but now I’m a student of biotechnology and psychology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. Scientifically I’m freak on any fluorescent methods connected with protein research. My B. Sc. thesis was mainly about FRET method in context of  regulation of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone protein. No I work in the field of neuroscience, especially on the molecular basis of schizophrenia (it doesn’t mean I live in a world of hallucinations). In my free time I love to play football and volleyball and listen to music, especially blues and rock.  Last year I've started in iGEM as a student and it was very challenging experience. I hope it will help during this year "synthetic" adventure
