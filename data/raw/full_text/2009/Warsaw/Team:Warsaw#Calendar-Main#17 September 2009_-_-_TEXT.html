Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation to the plasmid
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
20μl purified plasmid backbone
20μl mgtC promoter
5μl LIgase Buffer (Fermentas)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
4μl H2O
The ligation was carried out in 18°C for 4h.
A fresh batch of chemocompetent bacteria was transformed according to the protocol.
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation to the plasmid
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
20μl purified plasmid backbone
10μl Cro-Box
4μl LIgase Buffer (Fermentas)
5μl 30% PEG
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
The ligation was carried out in 18°C for 4h.
A fresh batch of chemocompetent bacteria was transformed according to the protocol.
Assembly of fusion proteins
Marcin
Task 1: Preparation of bacterial cultures to isolate mitochondrial peptide on pSB1A3 plasmid
One important remark:
Data from sequencing reactions clearly show that previously isolated plasmid which should contain: mitochondrial peptide CDS ( BBa_K177028 - blunt ligation with pKSII) and BBa_K177037 are other commercial plasmids. Something is wrong - some plasmids samples have been contaminated.
