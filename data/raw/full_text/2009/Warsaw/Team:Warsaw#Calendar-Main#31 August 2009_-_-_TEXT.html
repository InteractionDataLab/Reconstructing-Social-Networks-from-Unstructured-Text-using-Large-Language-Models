Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
mgtC promoter digest
Ligation
Methods:
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
40μl purified PCR product
5μl Buffer O (Fermentas)
1μl EcoRI enzyme
1μl PstI enzyme
3μl H2O
The digest was carried out in 37°C for 3h and inactivated for 15 min. in 80°C.
The product was later purified using Montage PCR Centrifugal Filter Device (Milipore).
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
40μl purified plasmid backbone
20μl purified PCR product
8μl Tango Buffer (Fermentas)
5μl 5mM dNTPs (EURx)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
6μl H2O
The ligation was carried out in 18°C overnight and then inactivated in 80°C for 15 min.
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation to the plasmid
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
40μl purified plasmid backbone
20μl Cro-Box
8μl Tango Buffer (Fermentas)
5μl 5mM dNTPs (EURx)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
6μl H2O
The ligation was carried out in 18°C overnight and then inactivated in 80°C for 15 min.
Making of the plac-RBS-llo-intA part
Jarek
Tasks:
