Miecznikowa group
We are working at the Faculty of Biology building, in the laboratory equiped by the Department of Virology and Department of Applied Microbiology . Our work is focused on the first element of our proposed system - the invasion operon. The supervisor of our group is Michael Lower and Marek Krzyżanowski is coordinating our work.
Team members
Marek Krzyżanowski
I am a student  at the  University of Warsaw. My B.Sc thesis in Department of Molecular Biology is about colocalization of some nuclear proteins, as a  part of elucidating biological role of ERH protein in human cells. Apart from biology I'm keen on motorsport and everything connected with cars.
Monika Niepokojczycka
I come from Warsaw and I’m a student of Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Immunology is about the role of Toll-like receptors in development and function of natural regulatory T cells. Apart from studing I'm keen on hiking, treking, photograpy and learnig what you can find to eat on your route;)
Franek Fijałkowski
I come from Warsaw, and as most of our team I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw.
I used to work in Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology on store-operated calcium channels in electrically non-excitable cells, but since September 2008 I have transfered to Department of Metabolic Regulation where I did my B. Sc. thesis on function of hypothalamic AMP-dependent kinase in the control of food intake.
I try do divide my free time between student associations (Student Association for Molecular Biology, and Student Association for Evolutionary Biology) and my precious animals - mainly tarantulas and scolopendras.
Anna Olchowik
I am a final year biotechnology student at the University of Edinburgh. Apart from biology I love traveling, ice skating and computer science, unfortunately it does not help me in becoming a better biologist. Programming is my standard cure  for insomnia. I like having fun with sun technologies, recently SunSPOTs and JavaFx. I will fill this empty space below or find the smaller photo very soon.
Michał Kamiński
I come from Warsaw and I'm studying Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Applied Microbiology are immunotoxins, especially potential usage of listeriolisyn O as an immunotoxin. In my free time I love to go hiking, treking, whitewater kayaking and sailing.
Jarosław Pankowski
I live near Warsaw and I study Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Genetic of Bacteria is about plasmids found in marine bacteria. Besides the science I'm interested in fantasy books, metal music and for some time in sword fighting.
