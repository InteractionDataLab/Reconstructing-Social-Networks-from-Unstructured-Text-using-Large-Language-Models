Preparation of biobricks to send
Marcin
Task 1: Preparation of bacterial cultures:
Comment:
I prepare liquid bacterial cultures for isolation of followed biobricks:
BBa_K177016
BBa_K177035
BBa_K177036
BBa_K177042
BBa_K177044
BBa_K177046
Task 2: Isolation of plasmid from cultures described in Task 1
Methods:
Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Assembly of endosome detection operon

Task 1: DNA digest to create following biobricks:
BBa_K177037
BBa_K177044
Methods:
Constructs to digest:
BBa_K177035 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177035 - PstI, XbaI
BBa_K177036 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177044 - PstI, XbaI
Reaction mixture composition:
15 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl enzyme 1 (Fermentas) 1 μl enzyme 2 (Fermentas)  5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 28 μl MQ water
Reactions were carried out 9 hour
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Plasmid isolation
Control digest
Methods:
The plasmids were isolated from 3μl of overnight liquid cultures using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology).
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
20μl purified plasmid
3μl Orange Buffer (Fermentas)
1μl PstI Enzyme (Fermentas)
1μl EcoRI Enzyme (Fermentas)
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out in 37°C for 4h.
The results were visualized on 1% agarose gel.
Results:
