Cloning of mitochondrial targeting signal
Sebastian
Task 1:
PCR with gradient temperature of anniling
Methods:
Reaction mixture:
1ul pAcGFP1-Mito (5ng)  1ul dNTPs (2mM) 1ul L-primer (5pmol/ul)  1ul R-primer (5pmol/ul)  1ul Pfu buffer  4,5ul ddH20 0,5ul Pfu DNA polymerase
PCR program:
5min 95C  1min 95C  1min gradient 48-60C  1min 72C  go to 2-nd step (30x)  5min 72C
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Transformant selection
Methods:
The colonies that remained white after 48h were picked up and transferred to a new petri dish.
Liquid cultures were established along the way for plasmid purification.
Both the dish and the liquid cultures were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for plasmid isolation
Preparation of bacterial cultures
Prepare LB medium with kanamycin
Add 3.5 ml of the medium to the probes
Add one bacterial colony to each probe
Breed the bacteria about 7 hours
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Transformation of the chemocompetent cells with the ligation of BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid and - lacI repressor
