Assembly of endosome detection operon
Marcin
Task 1: Prepare the following ligations:
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177036 to obtain BBa_K177037
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177043 to obtain BBa_K177044
Methods:
Reaction mixtures composition:
45 μl mixture of insert and vector DNA (both are purified at the same probe) 1.5 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas) 5 μl Ligase Buffer (Fermentas)
Ligation was carried out 6 hours in 16 °C. Subsequently both mixtures were divided up two portions. In the case of each reaction one portion was thermally inactivated and the latter one was unremoved.
Task 2: Transformation of TOP10 chemocompetent bacteria with following constructs:
BBa_K177044
BBa_K177037
Methods:
Ligation mixture was thermally inactivated
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
PCR of phoP and phoQ
Monika
Task:
amplification of phoP (675 bp) and phoQ (1464 bp)
Methods:
PCR mixture:
1μl Pfu polymerase buffer  0,2μl forward primer and 1μl reverse primer  0,4μl dNTPs (10 mM)  0,5μl Pfu turbo polymerase (EURX)  0,4μl template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2  The solution was topped up with H2O to 10μl    contol - no template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2
PCR conditions:
1. 3min 95°C    2. 30s 95°C    3. 35s 58°C    4. 2min 10 s 72°C    5. go to step 2, 2 times    6. 30s 95°C    7. 30s 68°C    8. 2min 10s 72°C    9. go to step 6, 28 times    10. 10min 72°C     11. forever 4°C
Results of PCR:
Bistable switch testing
Monika
Task: Control digestion of bistable switch
Methods

Will be seen tomorrow
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Cro-box preparation
Ligation
Methods:
Two short oligonucleotides were annealed to form a complete double stranded cro-box sequence with XbaI and PstI sticky ends. Equal concentrations of both oligonucleotides were mixed together, heated to 95°C for 15 min. and left to cool.
The pSB1A3 plasmid was digested with XbaI and PstI and the resulting backbone was isolated (all as described previously).
The ligation was carried out in 18°C for 4h.
