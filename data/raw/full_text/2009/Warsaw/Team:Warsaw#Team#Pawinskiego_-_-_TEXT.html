Pawinskiego group
We are working at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS building, in the laboratory equiped by the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology . Our work is focused on the "effector" elements of our proposed system - mainly the cytoplasmic operon, but also the endosome detection operon. The supervisor of our group is Pawel Krawczyk , and Kamila Ornoch is coordinating our work.
Team members
Kamila Ornoch
I come from Warsaw and study Biology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology is about intracellular localization of Suv3 protein from Danio rerio. And I love to climb: high is my infatuation :)
Kamil Koper
I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Jakub Piątkowski
I study biotechnology at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). My research interests include RNA turnover in mitochondria and the evolution of organellar genomes. My B.Sc. thesis focused on a novel RNA-binding protein DMR1p in S. cerevisiae. Currently I’m working on my M.Sc. thesis, where I plan to include more detailed description of RNA-protein interactions in yeast mitochondrion. I also participate in the activities of the students’ societies: of Molecular and Synthetic Biology.
Marcin Ziemniak
I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics , UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Andrzej Prokop
I was born in Sanok and I'm studying Molecular Biology at the University of Warsaw. I have just defended my bachelor's thesis in the topic of RNA-directed DNA methylation. I am fascinated with the RNA WORLD and my plan is to continue that passion in practical way. I also share some passions with this guy with the millipede avatar, which are spiders, snakes, scorpions and other cute and fluffy animals. Moreover, I like good black metal, ambient, classical music and garlic.
Justyna Lesiak
I am a student of Master Degree in Molecular Biology at the Univeristy of Warsaw, but I spent last semester at Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. Now I am working in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology and in the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. I am not focused on one topic, and I always wanted to do lots of new and challenging things in the science area, however I must admit cancer researches are one of my very favourites, as well as human mitochondrial diseases. In my spare time I like to listen to classical and chamber music, read books, do irish dancing (I admire reels and hornpipes) and horseback riding.
Sebastian Jeleń
I come from small town in the south-east Poland. I always wanted to study chemistry but 4 years ago I suddenly decided to study biotechnology. After these 4 years of study I see that it wasn't bad decision. Except doing some research in my lab (hSUV3 rules!) I love taking pictures and playing computer games.
Anna Saffray
I am a high school student and I have lived in Warsaw since 2003. Before that  I lived in France near Paris . I  always loved to do some experiments in my school , so when I started to work in the laboratory it was a great pleasure spending days with pipettes.
