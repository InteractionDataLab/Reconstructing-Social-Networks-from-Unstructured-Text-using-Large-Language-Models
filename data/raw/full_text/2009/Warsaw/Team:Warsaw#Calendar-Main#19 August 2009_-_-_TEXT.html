Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Gel-outs of following constructs digested on 17.08.09:
cro CDS on pKSII plasmid
BBa_C0040 with BBa_B0032 on pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
All samples were inactivated via heating in 80 °C for 20 minutes
All gel-outs were performed using the EurX gel-out kit according to the manual
Results:
cro digested from pKSII (rigth)
Purification of insert assembled with C0040 and RBS failed because of very low DNA concentration after plasmid isolation
Task 2:
Ligate cro CDS to pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl insert 7 μl vector 2.3 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 3 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX) 1 μl T4 ligase (Fermentas)
Ligation was performed for about 9 hours and it was subsequently thermally inactivated
Task 3:
Prepare bacterial cultures to isolate following constructs:
BBa_R0080 on pSB1A3 plasmid
BBa_C0040 with BBa_B0032 on pSB1A3 plasmid
Task 4:
Isolate of constructs described in Task 3:
Methods:
Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Task 5:
Digest previously isolated plasmids with C0040+B0032 biobricks:
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
35 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 10 μl MQ water
Digest was performed overnight
Making of the plac-RBS-llo part
Jarek
Tasks:
Isolation of plasmid DNA from 20 liquid cultures
Digestion of the plasmid DNA with PstI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases
