Acquiring the internaline A gene from Listeria monocytogenes st. EDG-e genome
Jarek
Tasks:
Electrophoretical segregation of PCR products from previous day in 0,8% agarosis gel (sample containing 10 microL was used).
Purifing DNA from agarose block with A&A Gel-Out kit.
Results:
Finally I have the correct PCR product (at least I hope it's that one).
Assembly of fusion proteins
Marcin
Task 1:
Digest pKSII cloning vector using SmaI:
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
15 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl SmaI (Fermentas) 2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 12.5 μl MQ water
Digestion was performed 6 hours and in next step enzyme was inactivated in 65 °C for 20 minutes
Task 2:
Phosphorylation of previously purified sequence of mitochondrial signal peptide from Cox1 :
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
15 μl purified plasmid DNA product 2 μl PNK Buffer (NEB) 0.5 μl PNK (NEB) 2.5 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM)
Reaction was performed 45 minutes and subsequently inactivate via heating (65 °C)
Task 3: Ligate of mitochondrial signal peptide to pKSII vector
Methods:
Ligation mixtures composition:
10 μl phosphorylated insert 8 μl digested vector  2.5 μl Tango buffer(Fermentas) 2.5 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas)
Ligation was carry out about 15 hours
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
20μl purified plasmid backbone
10μl purified PCR product
4μl Ligase buffer (Fermentas)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
5μl H2O
The ligation was carried out in 18°C for 3h and then inactivated in 80°C for 15 min.
A fresh batch of chemocompetent bacteria was transformed with the ligation mix and incubated on agarose plates containing double dose of ampicilin.
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Ligation to the plasmid
Bacteria transformation
Methods:
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
10μl purified plasmid backbone
10μl purified PCR product
3μl Ligase buffer (Fermentas)
1μl T4 Ligase (Fermentas)
6μl H2O
The ligation was carried out in 18°C for 3h and then inactivated in 80°C for 15 min.
A fresh batch of chemocompetent bacteria was transformed with the ligation mix and incubated on agarose plates containing double dose of ampicilin.
