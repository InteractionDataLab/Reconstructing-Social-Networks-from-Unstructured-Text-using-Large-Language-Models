Assembly of fusion proteins
Marcin
Task 1:
Digest plasmids isolated in 09.09.2009 to reveal the identity of the constructs
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
3 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.5 μl PstI (Fermentas) 2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 14 μl MQ water
Digest was performed 90 minutes
Results:
None constructs are correct. It is obligated to perform cloning second time. If I dephosphorylate the vector prior to ligation the result should be better.
Task 2:
dephosphorylation the following molecules previously digested by resctriction enzymes:
BBa_K177036
pKSII cloning vector
Reaction mixture composition:
15 μl purified plasmid DNA product 2 μl Tango Buffer (Fermentas) 1 μl CIAP (Fermentas)
Reaction was performed 45 minutes and subsequently inactivate via heating (65 °C)
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid

Tasks:
Plasmid isolation
Control digest
Methods:
Plasmids from 3 ml of overnight culture were isolated using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology).
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
20μl isolated plasmid
3μl Buffer O (Fermentas)
1μl PstI enzyme
1μl EcoRI enzyme
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out for 3h in 37°C and then inactivated in 80°C for 15min.
The results were visualised on 1% agarose gel
Results:
All empty
Conclusions:
So tired, need sleep...

1μl EcoRI enzyme
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out for 3h in 37°C and then inactivated in 80°C for 15min.
The results were visualised on 2% agarose gel
Results:
All empty
Conclusions:
So tired, need sleep...
I actually wrote some very witty comments bellow every picture, but it seams that two people can't edit one page at the same time and I got an error when Marcin saved his. Believe me, the comments were hilarious, but now I'm just to tired to write them again so you have to be satisfied with the "all empty" notes.
