Testing of Biobrick parts obtained from the registry
Kamil
Tasks:
Amplify the plasmid in bacterial culture
Extract plasmids
Digest the extracted plasmids
Methods:
Bacteria from a single colony were cultivated overnight (~12h) in 50ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin   (100ug/ml) and kanamycin (30ug/ml)
The plasmids were extracted using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology).
Digest mixture's composition:
2ul Orange buffer (Fermentas) 1ul EcoRI enzyme 1ul PstI enzyme 3ul plasmid extract
The solution was topped up with H2O to 20ul.
The digest was kept at 37 °C for 3h.
The electrophoretic separation was carried out on 1,5% agarose gel
Results:
Gel (from left)
GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix #SM0333 (Fermentas)
B1001 ?
C0012 OK
Discussion:
The B1001 brick is too small to show up on a 1,5% agarose gel and should be tested by direct sequencing.
The C0012 brick looks OK
