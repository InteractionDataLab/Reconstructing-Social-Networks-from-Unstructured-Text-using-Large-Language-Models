Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Gel-out of digested biobricks
Methods
After the digest samples were loaded into gel and electrophoretically separated
Image of the digested biobricks:
verification of the effectiveness of the restriction digest
Fragments of agarose gel were carefully cut out and in the next step DNA was extracted from the gel using the A&A gel-out kit. Detailed procedure is described here
Quantification of concentration of p53 DNA after restriction digest:
1 μl of the digest mixture was diluted to 10 μl and loaded into the gel.
quantification DNA abundance
after gel-out
Destription of the gel
lane 1 - B0032
lane 2 - C0040
lane 3 - C0051
lane 4 - E0032
Task 2:
Ligations of biobricks
Comment:
Due to obtain set of biobricks which each of them contain RBS and particular coding sequence I designed the following elemets (the order of biobricks is from the 5'end to 3' end):
BBa_B0032 + BBa_c0040
BBa_B0032 + BBa_C0051
BBa_B0032 + BBa_E0032
BBa_B0032 (ligation of empty vector as a negative control of the experiment)
Methods:
Ligation mixture composition:
3 μl digested plasmid with RBS  3 μl digested CDS  5 μl ligation buffer (Fermentas, PEG4000 have been added previously)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas) 13 μl MQ water
Negative control mixture composition:
3 μl digested plasmid with RBS 5 μl ligation buffer (Fermentas, PEG4000 have been added previously) 1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas) 16 μl MQ water
Duration of ligation was about 8 hours
Task 3:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain DH5α
Methods:
Ligation reaction was stopped via thermal inactivation in 80°C for 20 minutes
Detailed protocol of ligation is described here . The only modification is total volume of ligation mixture prepared 16.07.09
petri dish were hold in 37°C for 36 hours
Cloning of p53 coding sequence
Marcin
Task:
Isolation and evaluation of pKS/p53 plasmid
Comment:
Besides high effectivity of transformation all of the bacterial colonies were blue. It is possible that excess of X-Gal may cause some problems with the selection system. Due to this uncentainty I decide to prepare a few bacterial breedings to isolate the plasmids and digest them.
Methods:
Prepare LB medium with kanamycin
Add 3.5 ml of the medium to the probes
Add one bacterial colony to each probe
Breed the bacteria about 8 hours
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Franek
Jarek
Jarek and Franek run the gel
Ania
only described it. Thank you guys:)
Tasks:
Samples of ligated BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 and BBa_C0012 - lacI repressor on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid cut with EcoRI and PstI were run on the gel.
Results: Obtain results confirm ligation of the http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_B0032 BBa_B0032 - RBS.3] and BBa_C0012 - lacI repressor , the undigested plasmid is visible on the gel. It is probably due to incorrect digestion buffer concentration.
Testing different E. coli strains regarding lacI and AraC repressors
Franek
Tasks:
Seting new liquid cultures to obtain of pure BBa_K177024 construct
Methods:
2 test tubes with 5ml LB and ampicillin were inoculated with colonies containing BBa_K177024 on pSB1A2 plasmid. The cultures were left for overnight incubation  at 37°C. This time cultures were taken from sparse plate
Results:
Will be determined next day by cell presence in tubes
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Transformant selection
Methods:
White colonies that appeared after 48h of incubation were picked up and transferred to a new petri dish.
Liquid cultures were established along the way for plasmid purification.
Both the dish and the liquid cultures were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Results:
All of the newly transferred colonies turned blue overnight as well and not suprisingly the purified plasmids yealded no mgtc promoter.
Conclusions:
It is possible that the X-gal used is not of top quality which may result in the late colorisation of the colonies.
It is also possible that the overwhelming autoligation rate is due to the fact that the SmaI enzyme has only 50% activity in 37°C, a fact that was not taken into account previously.
