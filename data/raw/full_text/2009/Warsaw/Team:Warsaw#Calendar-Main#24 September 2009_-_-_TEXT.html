Assembly of endosome detection operon
Marcin
Comment:
Result of following ligations was disappointing (no one bacterial colony on the plates):
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177036 to obtain BBa_K177037
BBa_K177035 with BBa_K177043 to obtain BBa_K177044
I examinated the effectiveness of DNA purification. The results reveal that the yield of used gel-out kit was surprisingly low. It forced me to prepare another enzymatic digestions.
Task 1: DNA digest to create following biobricks:
BBa_K177037
BBa_K177044
Methods:
Constructs to digest:
BBa_K177035 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177035 - PstI, XbaI
BBa_K177036 - PstI, SpeI
BBa_K177044 - PstI, XbaI
Reaction mixture composition:
15 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl enzyme 1 (Fermentas) 1 μl enzyme 2 (Fermentas)  5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 28 μl MQ water
Reactions were carried out 7 hour and subsequently they were inactivated via heating.
PCR of phoP
Monika
Task:
amplification of phoP (675 bp)
Methods:
PCR mixture:
5μl Pfu polymerase buffer  1μl forward primer and 1μl reverse primer  2μl dNTPs (10 mM)  2,5μl Pfu turbo polymerase (EURX)  2μl template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2  The solution was topped up with H2O to 50μl    contol - no template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2
PCR conditions:
1. 5min 95°C    2. 30s 95°C    3. 2min 72°C    4. go to step 2 x30     5. 10min 72°C     6. forever 4°C
Results of PCR:
There were no products of phoP amplification
There were no products of phoQ amplification
Comment:
We suppose there were some problems with polymerase and PCR programme was wrongly chosen
Isolation of BBa_J63010 from 2009 Kit
Monika
Tasks:
Isolate BioBrick BBa_J63010 from 2009 Kit Plate 1
Methods:
Alkaline lysis with A&A Biotechnology Kit, procedure described here
Monika
Task:
amplification of phoP (675 bp) and phoQ (1464 bp)
Methods:
PCR mixture:
5μl Pfu polymerase buffer  1μl forward primer and 1μl reverse primer  2μl dNTPs (10 mM)  2,5μl Pfu turbo polymerase (EURX)  2μl template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2  The solution was topped up with H2O to 50μl      contol - no template DNA from Salmonella enterica typhimurium LT2
PCR conditions:
1. 3min 95°C    2. 30s 95°C    3. 35s 59°C    4. 2min 72°C    5. go to step 2, 2 times    6. 30s 95°C    7. 2min 40s 72°C    8. go to step 6, 28 times    9. 10min 72°C     10. forever 4°C
Results of PCR:
Cloning of the cro-box into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Selection of the colonies
Methods:
Additional colonies were selected and transferred to a fresh agarose plate, liquid cultures were established.
The plate and the liquid cultures were incubated overnight in 37°C
