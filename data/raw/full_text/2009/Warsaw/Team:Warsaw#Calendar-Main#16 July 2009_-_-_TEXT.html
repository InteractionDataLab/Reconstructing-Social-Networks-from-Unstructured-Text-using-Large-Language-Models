Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Transformant selection
Methods:
White colonies were picked up and transferred to a new petri dish.
Liquid cultures were established along the way for plasmid purification.
Both the dish and the liquid cultures were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Results:
All of the transferred colonies turned blue overnight and the purified plasmids yealded no mgtc promoter.
Cloning of p53 coding sequence
Marcin
Task:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain DH5α
Methods:
Ligation reaction was stopped via thermal inactivation in 80°C for 20 minutes
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here . The only modification is usage of half volume of ligation mixture prepared 15.07.09
Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task:
Restriction digest of biobricks
Comment:
Due to obtain set of biobricks which each of them contain RBS and particular coding sequence some of biobricks were digested:
BBa_B0032
BBa_c0040
BBa_C0051
BBa_E0032
Methods:
Digest of BBa_B0032 using SpeI and PstI
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl SpeI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 34 μl MQ water
Digest of other biobricks using PstI and XbaI
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 34 μl MQ water
Both reaction were performed overnight (~12 hours) and both of them were subsequently inactivated via heating in 80°C for 20 minutes
Construction of K177012 operon1_part2
Ania
Tasks:
Set up a liquid culture from transformants containing BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 and BBa_C0012 - lacI repressor on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid.
Alkaline lysis of bacterial cultures to obtain plasmid.
Digest of the ligated BBa_B0032 - RBS.3 and BBa_C0012 - lacI repressor on the pSB1A2 ampicillin resistant plasmid with EcoRI and PstI to confirm ligation.
Testing different E. coli strains regarding lacI and AraC repressors
Franek
Tasks:
Alkaline lysis of bacterial cultures to obtain BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 devices
Transformation of Top10/ BL/ GM/ V1011/ V1012/ TopF'/ DH5a competent cells with BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025
Methods:
2 test tubes with 5ml LB and ampicillin were first inoculated with colonies containing BBa_K177024 and BBa_K177025 on pSB1A2 plasmid. The cultures were incubated overnight at 37°C. Alkaline lysis was performed on both cultures, according to our standard procedure . The pellet from 5 ml of bacteria was used.
Chemocompetent E. coli cells from Top10/ BL/ GM/ V1011/ V1012/ TopF'/ DH5a strains (prepered earlier by Kuba) were transformed according to our standard procedure with either BBa_K177024 or BBa_K177025
Results:
Will be determined by cell colonies presence on plates
