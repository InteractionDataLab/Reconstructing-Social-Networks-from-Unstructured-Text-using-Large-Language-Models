Insertion of the pho gene into the pKSII+ plasmid
Kama
Plasmid digest mix was prepared as follows:
2μl Tango buffer (Fermentas) 1μl pKSII plasmid 1μl XbaI enzyme 1μl SmaI enzyme
the solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20 μl.
Pho gene digest mix was prepared as follows:
2μl Tango buffer (Fermentas) 3μl purified gene 1μl XbaI enzyme
the solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20 μl.
The digest was kept for 3h at 37°C, and then the enzymes were inactivated for 20min. at 80°C.
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
20μl plasmid 20μl gene 5μl ligation buffer G (Fermentas) 2μl T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas)
the solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 50 μl. The ligation was carried out in 18°C overnight   (~15h)
