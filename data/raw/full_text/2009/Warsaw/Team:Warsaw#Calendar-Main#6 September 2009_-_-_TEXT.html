Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task:1
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli TOP10 strain
Construct to transform:
BBa_K177037 on pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods:
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here
Task 2:
Digest isolated plasmid with Bax CDS to verify the correctness of the ligation:
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
2 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl RsaI (NEB) 2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 15 μl MQ water
Digest was performed 3 hours
Results:
Comments:
The enzym must have been deactivated due to presence of two forms of the plasmid. If circular plasmid is cut there are only one linear form in the sample. Althought in each case there was two forms - circular and supercoiled.
