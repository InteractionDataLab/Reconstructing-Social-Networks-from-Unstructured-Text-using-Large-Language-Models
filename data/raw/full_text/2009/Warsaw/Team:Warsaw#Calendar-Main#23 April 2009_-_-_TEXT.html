Tasks:
Amplification of inv
Methods:
PCR mixture's composition:
2,5μl pfu buffer (Fermentas)  2,5μl MgSO4 (Fermentas)  1,5μl primers  1,5μl dNTPs (10 mM)  0,5μl pfu turbo polymerase (od Antka) 1μl template DNA from Yersinia
Solution was topped up with H2O to 25μl.

Tasks:
Purification of the PCR product
Plasmid assembly
Methods:
The purification was carried out using Montage PCR Centrifugal Filter Device P36461 (Milipore) and according to the protocol   supplied.
Plasmid digest mix was prepared as follows:
2ul Tango buffer (Fermentas)  1ul pKSII plasmid  1ul XbaI enzyme  1ul SmaI enzyme
The solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20 ul.
hly gene digest mix was prepared as follows:
2ul Tango buffer (Fermentas)  2ul purified gene  1ul XbaI enzyme
the solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 20 ul.
The digest was kept for 3h at 37°C, and then the enzyme was inactivated for 15min. at 80°C.
The ligation mix was prepared as follows:
1ul plasmid  1ul gene  1ul ligation buffer G (Fermentas)  1ul T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas)
The solution was topped up with H2O to the final volume of 10 ul. The ligation was carried out in 18°C overnight  (~12h) and the inactivated for 10min. at 65°C.

The trained eye can distingish between the three isoforms of a plasmid. Looks good enough for transformation.
