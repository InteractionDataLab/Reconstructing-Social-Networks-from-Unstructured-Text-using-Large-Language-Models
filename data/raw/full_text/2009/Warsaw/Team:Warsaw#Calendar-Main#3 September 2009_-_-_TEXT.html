Acquiring the internaline A gene from Listeria monocytogenes st. EDG-e genome
Jarek
Tasks:
Digestion of PCR products, separetly with MboI and CaiI restriction endonucleases
Electrophoretical segregation of digested samples in 1,5% agarose gel
Preparation of another PCR reaction with L.monocytogenes genome DNA
Results:
There were no visible products of digestion, even after long treatment with ethidium bromide. Propably the Clean-Up kit isn't working well. I'll try to acquire IntA gene with another PCR.
Preparation of glycerol stocks

Task 1:
Isolate the plasmids containing  following construct:
BBa_K177035 on pSB1A3 plasmid
Methods: Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Task 2:
Digestion of plasmids previously described constructs
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
20 μl purified plasmid DNA product 1 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 1 μl PstI (Fermentas)  2 μl Buffer Tango (Fermentas) 15 μl MQ water
Digest was performed about six hours and subsequently thermal inactivated
Task 3:
Gel-outs of construct described in Task 2
Methods:
All gel-outs were performed using the EurX gel-out kit according to the manual
Task 4:
Ligation of following constructs:
BBa_K177037 on pSB1A3 plasmid
cro CDS on pSB1A3
Bax CDS on pSB1A3
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
10 μl digested insert 8 μl digested vector  2 μl Tango buffer(Fermentas) 3 μl dNTPs mixture (EurX, concentration 5 mM)  1 μl ligase T4 (Fermentas)
Reaction were carried out 12 hours and subsequently thermally inactivated.
Cloning of the mgtc promoter into the pSB1A3 plasmid
Kamil
Tasks:
Plasmid isolation
Control digest
Methods:
Plasmids from 3 ml of overnight culture were isolated using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology).
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
20μl isolated plasmid
3μl Buffer O (Fermentas)
1μl PstI enzyme
1μl EcoRI enzyme
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out for 3h in 37°C and then inactivated in 80°C for 15min.
The results were visualised on 1% agarose gel
Results:
First four bands (besides the the size ruler) show empty plasmids.
Conclusions:
Respawn and try again in... 3 days.

Tasks:
Plasmid isolation
Control digest
Methods:
Plasmids from 3 ml of overnight culture were isolated using the Plasmid Mini kit (A&A Biotechnology).
The digest mix was prepared as follows:
20μl isolated plasmid
3μl Buffer O (Fermentas)
1μl PstI enzyme
1μl EcoRI enzyme
5μl H2O
The digest was carried out for 3h in 37°C and then inactivated in 80°C for 15min.
The results were visualised on 1% agarose gel
Results:
Final five bands show empty plasmids.
Conclusions:
Respawn and try again in... 3 days.
Cotransformation to obtain cells with following plasmid combinations [ K177012 , K177011 ][ K177012 , K177038 ][ K177033 , K177011 ][ K177033 , K177038 ]
