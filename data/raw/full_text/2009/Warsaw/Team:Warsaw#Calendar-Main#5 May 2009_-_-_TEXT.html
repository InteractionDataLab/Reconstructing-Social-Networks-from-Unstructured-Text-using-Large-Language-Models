Cloning of hly gene into pKSII+ vector
Kamil
Tasks:
Verify the correctness of the pKS/hly constructs
Methods:
The BanI enzyme was selected for the test because the hly insert bears an additional digest site.
Digest mixture's composition:
2ul Orange buffer (Fermentas) 1ul BanI enzyme 5ul plasmid solution
The solution was topped up with H2O to 20ul.
The digest was kept at 37 °C overnight (~18h) and then inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min.
The electrophoretic separation was carried out on 1% agarose gel
Results:
Gel (from left)
GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix #SM0333 (Fermentas) (3ul)
sample no. 14 (5ul)
sample no. 15 (5ul)
sample no. 16 (5ul)
sample no. 18 (5ul)
pKS plasmid (control) (5ul)
Discussion:
The expected fragments size for the pKS plasmid are 142, 491, 1097 and 1171  base  pairs.
The expected fragments size for the insert containing plasmid are 142, 535, 1097, 1171 and 1538   base pairs.
The samples no. 14, 15 and 16 were supposed to conatin the hly insert.
The sample no. 18 did not contain the hly insert and was used as a second control.
