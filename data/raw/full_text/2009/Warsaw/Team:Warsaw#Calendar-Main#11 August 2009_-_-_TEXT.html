Assembly of endosomal detection operon
Marcin
Task 1:
Prepare the bacterial cultures for isolation of plasmid containing BBa_R0080 and BBa_E0022
Preparation of bacterial cultures
Prepare LB medium with ampicillin
Add 3.5 ml of the medium to the probes
Add one bacterial colony to each probe
Breed the bacteria about 7 hours
Task 2:
Isolate the plasmid containing BBa_R0080 and BBa_E0022
Methods:
Plasmids were isolated using the A&A plasmid mini kit. Detailed procedure of the isolation is described here
Task 3:
Digest of isolate plasmids  verify the success of isolation using EcoRI and PstI
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
1 μl purified plasmid DNA product 0.5 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.5 μl PstI (Fermentas) 2 μl Buffer Orange (Fermentas) 16 μl MQ water
The reaction was performed two hours and it was subsequently inactivated via heating in 80°C for 20 minutes.
After the inactivation samples were frozen in -20°c
Task 4:
Transformation of chemocompetent E. coli strain DH5α
Methods:
Ligation prepared in 08.08.09 was stopped via thermal inactivation in 80°C for 20 minutes
Detailed protocol of transformation is described here .
Task 5:
Isolate the crobox sequence from digested construct
Methods:
After the digestion reaction mixture was loaded on the gel and electrophoretically separated
Results:
verification of the digestion results
Comment:
There was no sign of digested crobox sequence. Probably the concentration of the DNA was low or agarose used to prepare the gel was partially degraded. The digestion should be prepare another time.
Task 6:
Digest pKS vector to isolate crobox sequence
Methods:
Reaction mixture composition:
20 μl purified plasmid solution  0.75 μl XbaI (Fermentas) 0.75 μl PstI (Fermentas) 5 μl Buffer Orange (Fermentas) 23.5 μl MQ water
The reaction was performed twenty hours and was subsequently inactivated via heating in 80°C for 20 minutes.
