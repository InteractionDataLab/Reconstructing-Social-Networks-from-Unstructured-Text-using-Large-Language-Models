Richard's iGEM 2009 Notebook
Richard on Grizzly Peak. Nice ride, yes?
(Too bad it's not mine)
About me:
Hi! My name is Richard Mar, and I am a member of the Berkeley Computational Tools team. I will be a 4th year CS student this fall. My hobbies include, but are not limited to: bicycling, computer games, table-tennis, and sim racing.
Projects:
Create a tutorial for writing Clotho plugins: done.
Creating a new unified plugin API: deferred to Bing and Thien.
Visualization for Eugene/Clotho - Spectacles: basic workspace and interaction done.
My long-term project is to create a visualization piece for Clotho with Joanna.
Look into and potentially integrate GUI components from BioJADE , ProMoT , and Gene Designer .
Integrate a iconified drag 'n' drop interface to Clotho via the Sequence View connection.
Use widget system from the NetBeans Visual Library .
