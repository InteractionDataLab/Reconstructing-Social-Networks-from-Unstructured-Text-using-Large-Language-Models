About me
I'm Lesia Bilitchenko and will be a 4th year computer science major at Cal Poly Pomona. I will be working this summer on developing Eugene a new language that will help describe biological system designs textually. Eugene will be integrated into Clotho. The other project will involve creation and optimization of Plug-Ins for Clotho.
