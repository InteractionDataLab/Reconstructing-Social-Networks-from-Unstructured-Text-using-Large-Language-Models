In the morning we had an introductory meeting and the students filled out forms so that they had key access to Cory Hall, the DOP Center, and their office space. It was great that we were able to get this taken care of so quickly! 
</P><P>After the short time together in the morning, they went to safety training from 10-noon. This was followed by a meeting of both teams over pizza lunch in Stanley Hall. This was a good chance to meet everyone and get some logistics out of the way (stipends, photo release forms, etc).
</P><P>
In the afternoon we did the following:
</P><UL><LI>Watched a short video on EDA
</LI><LI>I gave an overview of the two web pages related to Clotho
</LI><LI><A href="http://biocad-server.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://biocad-server.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2008.igem.org/Team:UC_Berkeley_Tools" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://2008.igem.org/Team:UC_Berkeley_Tools</A></LI></UL><LI>Everyone signed up for Bugzilla and got a quick little overview
</LI><LI><A href="http://biocad-server.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://biocad-server.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla</A></LI><LI>I gave an overview of the 6 different project areas available for this summer
</LI><LI>Visualization tools
</LI><LI>Language development
</LI><LI>Plug-in and community development
</LI><LI>Workflow development (Kepler)
</LI><LI>Data Model revamp
</LI><LI>Robot/Automation
</LI><LI>Everyone configured Netbeans and set up CVS so that they could download Clotho
</LI><P>
At the end of the meeting the students were given tasks for the week. The first tasks for the team are as follows:
</P><OL><LI>Think about which project(s) you would like to be involved in.
</LI><LI>Add an entry to your notebook with the following:
</LI><LI>Introductory paragraph
</LI><LI>Picture
</LI><LI>Short description of their first <B>short project</B></LI><LI>Short description of their first <B>long project</B> (with a bulleted list of tasks they are going to need to take)
</LI><LI>Play with Clotho
</LI><LI>Take notes on all the bugs they find
</LI><LI><B>Prize for the most/best bugs found</B></LI><LI>Give feedback on the help files
</LI><LI>Meet with Doug before the week is out to talk about their role on the team
</LI></OL><P>Today we:
</P><OL><LI>Discussed how to edit the wiki

</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Densmore_01:33.2C_7_June_2009_.28UTC.29"><A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Densmore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Densmore (page does not exist)">Densmore</A> 01:33, 7 June 2009 (UTC) </SPAN></H1><P>Today (Saturday), Bing, Nade, Richard, and I came into the DOP Center. With the exception of Richard, everyone was here to close as many bugs as possible before the next beta build on Monday. Richard was here to work on the plug-in tutorial and materials. 
</P><P>In general it was a pretty successful day. We closed all the &quot;easy&quot; bugs and got to most of the critical other ones. In general I think it is a pretty solid version for the wet lab to start with. The major missing piece right now is a way for someone to delete entries in the database. This is an issue since you need to decide what to do with all parts that refer to the newly deleted item. Should you fill those pointers to &quot;null&quot;? If so, we need to make sure none of the tools will &quot;break&quot; if they read a null value (this should be done anyway). Another option is for a more elaborate delete. For example if I delete a biobrick, perhaps I should delete all samples which refer to it as well?
</P><P>Anyway, those issues will be taken care of next time:)
</P><P>
Here is the list of bugs we found on Thursday. It is now broken down into those that are &quot;fixed&quot; and those that are &quot;open&quot;. While the open list looks large, really most of these are not bugs bug just comments from the group. I kept these around so we would have a record of them.

</P><P>In the morning we had a group meeting the main issues I wanted to raise were:
</P><UL><LI>The help files are still in bad shape. They need to be cleaned up more. I asked everyone to continue cleaning up their help files. If they think they are done, ask me individually.
</LI><LI>I talked about the wiki entries. Various levels of detail and quantity of material. In general they are good. Keep up the good work. Wiki entries remain a weekly requirement.
</LI><LI>In the afternoon we have a dry run of the plug-in tutorial at 5pm. We are going to run through what Richard put together.
</LI><LI>Please continue to give me feedback on bugs in new version (Thien found a bug during the meeting with images in help).
</LI></UL><P>The other major thing going on today are that I have to pick up Lesia. I asked the team to please make sure to help her with:
</P><UL><LI>Learning how to edit and use the wiki
</LI><LI>Set up netbeans, CVS, and check out and run the code
</LI><LI>Make sure she knows about the google calendar and email
</LI><LI>Richard can introduce himself and teach her a little about plugIns
</LI><LI>Make sure she knows how to get to the key card office and where Jontae sits

   * What is the impact if successful?
   * How will the program be organized?
   * How will intermediate results be generated?
   * How will you measure progress?
   * What will it cost?
</PRE><P><B>Misc</B></P><UL><LI>As a group need a big picture slide
</LI><LI>Today at the Clotho tutorial, Patrick and Jenn were having problems getting Java 6/Clotho to work on a Mac. Evan has been put in contact with them. The end result should be an update to the wiki FAQ with updated instructions.
</LI></UL><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Densmore_00:30.2C_11_June_2009_.28UTC.29"><A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Densmore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Densmore (page does not exist)">Densmore</A> 00:30, 11 June 2009 (UTC) </SPAN></H1><P>Today was another busy day filled with meetings. I had a meeting with Bing in the morning about the data model. Here are my misc notes:
</P><UL><LI> Need to define the Clotho Keywords (CK) list
</LI><LI> This is a set of objects. Objects have fields as well
</LI><LI> We DO NOT define a relationship between objects
</LI></UL><LI> Add the ability to have a Keywords Extensions (KE) list
</LI><LI> Require a binding file
</LI><LI> The binding file assigns database tables to CK objects and fields
</LI><P>The once the binding file has been created, then the new data model will create connections based on what is in the database. This allows for two types of checks by tools:
</P><UL><LI> A check if a CK is bound to an element in the database
</LI><LI> This allows straight retrieval and committing to the database
</LI></UL><LI> A check if a CK is reachable from another CK
</LI><LI> This allows relational queries
</LI><P>Reachability from CK to CK can be determined through KE objects as well.
</P><P>
After the data model meeting, I spent the afternoon with 9th graders from Cal Prep. I showed them around campus, our lab, and JCA lab. It was fun. They were great kids and had a lot of energy.
</P><P>The last meeting I had was with Bing and Nina about the robot. We went over the protocol that Jenn sent us. It appears that there are three basic operations that we can support:
</P><UL><LI> Transfer (ONE well to ONE other well)
</LI><LI> Combine (Move MANY wells to ONE other well)
</LI><LI> Move (ONE well to MANY wells)
</LI></UL><P>Nina and Bing are going to begin to code these primitive operations. In addition to the operation itself, there are two other axis:
</P><UL><LI> The parameters for the operation
</LI><LI> If it is an operation for the robot or a set of detailed instructions for a human
</LI></UL><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Densmore_02:13.2C_12_June_2009_.28UTC.29"><A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Densmore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Densmore (page does not exist)">Densmore</A> 02:13, 12 June 2009 (UTC)</SPAN></H1><P>Today I met with the visualization team. We quickly realized that we can't talk about much until they get a basic environment set up. Here are the current issues:
</P><UL><LI>BioJADE - can't get it to run. Appears that they need to resolve mySQL isses (BioJADE wants a local mySQL install)
</LI><LI>ProMoT - requires lisp support?
</LI><LI>Visual Library - available in Netbeans, not outside of Netbeans
</LI><LI>Java FX - talks to java, java does not talk to java FX? (Richard can comment on this)
</LI></UL><P>I have sent Richard and Joanna my old project which used Visual Library. Hopefully they will be able to salvage something from this. I know JCA really wants us to use Java FX. I personally want something easy to use and something we can build on.
</P><P>We also have our group meeting. Lesia and Adam showed off their version first version of BOL. They have started a white paper and have example syntax started. Overall a really good start.

The rest of the day I spent revising the SDS algorithm code so that we can calculate the cost of a final assembly independent of the cost metrics used to build the assembly graph (which could be corrupt when we break cycles to perform valid 2ab coloring). I also fixed a bug that Nina found while playing around with Clotho.

This is going to be much more robust and will be a much better way of doing things as compared to the first approach. I expect Bing and Evan to have an illustration soon that shows what we are going to do. This is key so that we can all get on the same page.
</P><P>Also today I met with Nina and Bing about the robot automation. This project is the one project which I have the least grasp of since the details of the protocol are key. Nina believes she will have a first pass done by Friday. That would be a good timeline since the wet team is just getting their oligos back this week. Hopefully we can get this tested out while the wet team is trying to build things (as opposed to having to make up our own test and running them).
</P><P>Another development has been the release of Clotho Beta build 6/15/09. This is the first build that has a truly working SDS algorithm. I spent TOO MUCH TIME fixing this but I am proud that it now works. Josh has given me some good feedback on ways that it is still lacking (primarily in how it formats output for the users). I can fix most of these issues quickly. My goal is still to get the JBE paper out before the end of the month. We will see. The only thing really holding it up is a concerted effort on the part of myself and the other authors. The code is 95% done.
</P><P>Finally here are some random thoughts:
</P><UL><LI>Think about how/where to add a functional API to Clotho
</LI><LI>Need a contact that understands GNU bison to help with &quot;Eugene&quot;
</LI><LI>Joanna and Richard are just going to build a JavaFX stand-alone app to see if they can even do what they think they can do with it before we worry about integrating it into Clotho
</LI><LI>Thien needs to meet with Chris for sample workflows. He needs to meet with Christopher Brooks to talk about Kepler issues

He is going to need it so that Kepler actors can make use of functions in Clotho. It got me to thinking that I should just post this list. It will continue to grow. However, now everyone can see it. This will be of use for the plug-in team as well.

So, I spent about an hour playing around with it. Here are my comments:
</P><UL><LI>In both the lexer rules and the parser token lists you are going to need to add: &amp;, |, &lt;,&gt;, &lt;=,&gt;=, etc for the rule enforcement. You might want to go ahead and add other keyboard elements just to &quot;future proof&quot; things a little.
</LI><LI> There need to be more comments in the code
</LI><LI> Try to make the code as modular as possible. If you can pull the lexer and parser pieces apart that would be a good first step.
</LI><LI>Declaring properties takes a string as a type. It might be better from a type safety standpoint to use enums.
</LI><LI>I would strongly recommend moving all the token definitions in the beginning into the lexer rules. Not only does it seem more natural to me, but it also will help folks find things and make the code more modular.
</LI><LI>It is confusing how you have defined LETTER. It is really a string of letters. You might want to call what you call a string a QUOTEDSTRING or something else.

After a brief introduction we did the following:
</P><UL><LI> Demo of Spectacles
</LI><LI> Demo/Explanation of Eugene
</LI><LI> Update on what is going on at Stanford (BioBrick Studio Mobile, Google base parts cloud, BioBrick Studio mock up and plans).
</LI><LI> Explanation of how to get Eugene executables from Sourceforge
</LI><LI> Discussion of ANTLR and Eugene.g code
</LI></UL><P>Here are some issues that came up during our meetings:
</P><UL><LI> Currently we have properties, components, and devices. Should we insert &quot;object&quot; between properties and components? An example of this would be &quot;sequence&quot; which both has a text value as well as a size. I personally do not have strong feelings about this since you can workaround this. I don't know what this gains us semantically.
</LI><LI> We need to make sure to keep a balance between expressiveness (what CS folks want) and encapsulation and ease of use (what biologists want). We should leverage the language (promoter, RBS, etc) that bio folks understand along with the language that CS folks understand (Object, int, instance, etc).
</LI></UL><P>Here are what our current tasks are:
</P><UL><LI>Spectacles
</LI><LI>Agree on a standard for vBOL files. Size, line length, line position, etc
</LI><LI>Add the ability to put a label below an image
</LI><LI>Proof of concept of Spectacles-&gt;Eugene
</LI></UL><LI>Eugene
</LI><LI>Integrate an editor into Spectacles. This does not need syntax highlighting. This could effectively replace the behavior of the eugene executable jar file.
</LI><LI>Create 3 constructs from Endy lab; create 3 constructs for Anderson lab
</LI><LI>We need to find a way to add &quot;include files&quot;. I am fine with a preprocessing step which inlines eugene code.
</LI><LI>We need to come up with a set of initial properties and components
</LI><LI>We need to make sure orientation is a property. It will be up to Spectacles to determine which image to display (i.e. forward or reverse rbs).
</LI><LI>We need to think about how to integrate an assembly format (e.g. BBA, BBB, etc) into how we do things like sequence determination for devices.
