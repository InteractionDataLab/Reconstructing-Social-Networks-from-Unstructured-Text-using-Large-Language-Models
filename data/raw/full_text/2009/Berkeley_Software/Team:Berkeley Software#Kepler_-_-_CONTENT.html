Automated Assembly and Kepler Integration

Often these are very complicated, take considerable time to develop and “debug”, and are lab/equipment specific. A highly modular, expressive, and extensible framework to capture and design these workflows would be useful. Our project integrated the Kepler workflow design environment with the existing Clotho platform, in order to formally capture a number of specific design protocols related to composite part assembly. </P><P><A href="http://kepler-project.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Kepler</A> is a multi-university design effort focusing on scientific workflows, and is used by a wide variety of projects in different fields. This work is done in conjunction with one of our sponsors, the <A href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Center for Hybrid &amp; Embedded Software Systems (CHESS)</A>. We are improving protocol automation and also creating material for a larger audience as well.</P><P>There are two main components to our discussion: The first, on this page, discusses the way in which we can go from a composite device, to an assembly graph (an object representing its efficient assembly), and finally to commands for a liquid handling robot. The second discussion involves more information about the way we converted this process into a Kepler workflow and provides an overview of the Kepler design software. We hope these pages provide all the information you need to understand this project and we would love to answer any questions you have either via <A href="mailto:clothodevelopment@googlegroups.com">email</A> or at the jamboree!

It is illustrated in a less confusing way (hopefully) in the following picture: 
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:658px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><SPAN style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><CENTER>Basic Parts and Composite Parts, Constructed out of Basic Parts, in Stage 1 of Our Running Example.</CENTER></SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In this step the main processing and file construction occurs. All files have a stage number appended to the end of their name thus they are not overwritten when the new stage is executed. </P><P>Once the parts required for this stage are picked, they are sorted depending on whether they are lefty, righty, or represent the final device (refer to <A href="https://2008.igem.org/Team:UC_Berkeley/LayeredAssembly" class="external text" rel="nofollow">2ab protocol</A> for more explanations) and depending on the type of vector that the parts are in. It becomes important for arrangement of the final parts of each stage for further user processing. Then plates are created: 
</P><UL><LI>Stock plate - plate with minipreps
</LI><LI>BigStock plate - enzyme plate with antibiotics, digestion mix, ligation mix and buffer
</LI><LI>Dilution plate - plate with diluted minipreps
</LI><LI>RxnPlate - plate with 2 diluted mini-preps mixed together, where digestion mix, and then ligase mix are added
</LI><LI>Platting plates - the plates where resultant parts are plated with antibiotics
</LI></UL><P>More about the created files:
</P><UL><LI>By default all newly-created files are stored in the projects folder in the same folder where Clotho lives
</LI><LI>DilutionFile(stage#).csv - contains commands for the robot to transfer minipreps for dilution (it is assumed that buffer pippetting is done by multi-channel); (file with similar name dilution4Jenn(stage#) contains user-friendly version of the above file for ease of checking the correctness of the produced instructions).
</LI><LI>ReationFile(stage#).csv - contains commands for robot; built according to user 2ab protocol inquiry;(file reaction4Jenn(stage#).csv is a user-friendly version for the correctness check).
</LI><LI>Platting(stage#).csv - contains instructions for robot about antibiotic transfer for selection process; based on that, reactants will be transferred one to one from the reaction plate by multi-channel pipette.
</LI><LI>UserInstructions(stage#) - file contains instructions about what the user has to have in plates, what decks the user has to put plates on, and what will be the outcome of following those instructions.
</LI></UL><P>Then assignment of wells proceeds. Parts used for construction are assigned to stock plate(s) and then to dilution plate, and then their final products are assigned to reaction plate depending on the sorted order. Then the volume check is performed and if a single part is used repeatedly, its quantity is reduced to one well or to the necessary number of wells in the dilution procedure (to achieve the necessary volume of diluted miniprep prior to reaction). Also at this stage a user can specify the stock plates that he wants the program to use. The assignment of wells in stock plates and their path to dilution plate will be modified. Going further, the dilution plate is assumed to be pre-filled with dilution buffer using a multi-pipetteman on robot. Once well assignment is completed, each plate in dilution step is assigned to an available deck on the robot, these assignments are recorded into the text file with user instructions, and a .csv file with cherry-picking commands for robot is produced. Then the robot decks are freed from the plates that participated in dilution and available decks are assigned to plates that participate in reaction procedure. Another .csv reaction file with commands for robot is constructed. The addition of the digestion mix and ligation mix is also recorded as cherry-picking commands for robot in that file. After this step, the deck assignment is recorded into the user instructions file, together with the amount of buffer required for dilution, amount of digestion and ligation mixes required for reaction to occur. After that the assignments of wells, where the composite parts for this stage will reside, are also recorded. </P><P>Robot decks are freed one more time. Another array of plates for platting the resultants with antibiotics (selection of successful parts) is created. Resultant parts are assigned to the platting plates. The plates are assigned to available decks on the robot and another .csv file with commands for robot to perform plating with antibiotics is created.</P><P>Information about decks and final parts location is recorded into the file with user instructions.
The program notifies the user that it has completed stage that was requested. 
The most important part on the theory behind this step in workflow is illustrated in the animation below:
</P><P><CENTER>This flash demo provides an animation example of how the various plates are created using our described workflow</CENTER></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="11._Robot">11.

</LI><LI>The user can generate files for robot starting from any stage at any time as long as he has the initial parts from which he started; or he can generate files for all stages of the ongoing project in a default folder and then rename that folder to prevent files from being overwritten and start working on another assembly project;
</LI><LI>Assigning plates by rows or by columns can be changed by physically going inside of the plugin and setting fillThePlateByRow parameter when the plate is initialized (or changing that default parameter in the constructor of the PlateClass class);
</LI><LI>The size of the plates is adjustable and can be anything specified as maxR (maximum number of rows) and maxC (maximum number of columns) when the plate is initialized; in the workflow currently 8X12 and 2X12 plates are used.
