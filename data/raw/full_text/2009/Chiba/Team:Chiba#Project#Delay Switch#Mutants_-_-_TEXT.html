Team:Chiba/Project/Delay Switch/Mutants
From 2009.igem.org
The mutants plasmid would be transformed with LuxP-gfp plasmid into E coli. Colonies were lifted onto nitrocellulose filter and placed on the top of lawn of Lux-senders. Over time, we kept watching the colony hue. Colonies should turn green when they detect the message passing through the NC filter. We were looking for the colony that turns green significantly after those of wildtype.
