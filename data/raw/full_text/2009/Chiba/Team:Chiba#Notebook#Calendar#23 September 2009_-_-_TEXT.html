Yesterday's operation is here .
Today's operation
10:30
We transplanted E.coli, which has been cultured on NC filter, to solid medium which contains each concentration of AHL.
AHL concentration is : 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM
We decided this time is T=0 and observed condition of fluorescence every 30 min.

Today's operation
11:00
We did main culture.
22:00
We measured OD.
OD600=1.98
Then, we spun down this culture solution and add 12.5 mL of flesh LB-Amp.
22:10
We add 12.5 μL of IPTG to the culture solution and started culture at 37 degrees Celsius.
Transformation(2)-1
Plasmid
plux-GFP(Cm, p15A)
Competent Cells
JW1262(pCIA3-LuxR(Amp))
JW1262(Null)
21:35
We transplanted these bacteria each plates.
pCIA3-LuxR and plux-GFP --> LB-Amp, Cm plate
plux-GFP only --> LB-Cm plate
21:50-
We cultured these plates.
