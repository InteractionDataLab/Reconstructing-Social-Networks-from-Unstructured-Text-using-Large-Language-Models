Making Fluorescent Transfer Curve for the Practice of Lab Work (Day 2)
main culture
10:30  We took 30 mL of the liquid medium that we had made yesterday to conical flask and added prior culture solution 300 μL, then started shake culture at 37 degrees Celsius.
Making glycerol stock
We kept mixture of 300 μL of 50% glycerol and 300 μL of solution which is cultured yesterday in deep freezer.
Making Transfer Curves
16:00
We put the solution that has completed main culture in 48 deep wells.
17:15
We shook 48 deep wells at 30 degrees Celsius.
While shaking, we measured OD and GFP fluorescence intensity of sample.
