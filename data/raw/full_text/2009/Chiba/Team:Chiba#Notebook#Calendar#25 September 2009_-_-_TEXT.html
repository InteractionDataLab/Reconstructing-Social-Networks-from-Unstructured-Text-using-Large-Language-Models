Today's operation
10:45-
We transplanted E.coli by 48 pins to NC filter and cultured it.
22:20 measurement start
We transplanted E.coli, which has been cultured on NC filter, to solid medium which contains each concentration of AHL.
AHL concentration is : 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM
We decided this time is T=0 and observed condition of fluorescence every 30 min.

11:05-
We did prior culture.
glycerol stock : plux-GFP with pCIA3-LuxR
23:35-
We attenuated culture solution 1/105 and dispersed on plate.
Then we cultured this plate at 37 degrees Celsius.
And We made plates from each of mixture and 10 mL of LB-Amp, Cm solution medium.
