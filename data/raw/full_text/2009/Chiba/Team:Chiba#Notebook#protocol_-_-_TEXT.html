Protocols
Transformation
Day 1 morning
100 ml SOB medium in 1L or 500 mL flask and sterilize
E.coli culture grown in 2 mL of fresh LB medium.
Day 1 night
Inoculate preculture (100 μL-1 mL) to sterile SOB medium.Shake culture vigoruoussly at 20-25 °C until OD is 0.4-0.6.
Day 2
Transfer the culture to ice 10min.
Prepare Wash buffer and Competent buffer by adding 3 mL Dilution buffer to 3 mL of Wash buffer(x2) and to 2.5 mL of Competent buffer(2x), respectively.(on ice)
Pellet the cells by centrifugarion at 2500rpm for 6 min.
Remove supernatant and genlly resupend the cells in 6 mL ice-cold Wash buffer(1x).
Pellet the cells by centrifugarion at 2500rpm for 6 min.
Completely remove the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in 6 mL ice-cold Competent buffer(1x).
Aliquot (on ice) 100μL of cell suspension into sterile 1.5 mL microtube and store in deep freezer.
DNA Purification
Sigma prep
Zymo DNA Cleam&Concentrator Kit
Add 2 volume of DNA binding buffer to each volume of DNA sample, Use voltex to mix.
Load mixture silica column and place column into a 2 ml collection tube
Centrifuge at full speed for 30 sec. Discard  the flow-through.
Add 200μL of wash buffer and spin 30 sec.
Place siliva volumn into a new 1.5 ml tube. Add water directly to the column matrix and spin to elute the DNA.
Agarose gel electrophoresis
Agalose Gel casting
Measure out the appropriate mass of agarose into glass bottle with the appropriate volume of TAE buffer
Microwave until the agarose is fully melted
Pour the agarose solution into the gelbox and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid
Remove comb
Running agalose gel
Load 5 μL prepared 1kbp ladder
Mix DNA solution with loading dye(6x) and water
Load it into agalose gel
Run the gel at ~100 volts for 35 mins.
Visualizing agarose gels
Remove gel from gel box
Soak the gel in ethidium bromide solution
Let it 30 min.
Place the gel in Trans-Illuminator and turn on UV light after make sure the door closing.
Print the picture.
Remove gel and throw in trash
Wipe down Trans-Illuminator if necessary.
Digestion
Mix (in a PCR tube)
plasmid DNA
buffer
Restriction Enzyme
NFW
Incubate at 37ºC for 3h
PCR
Resuspend primer in Nuculease free water to 100 µM
PCR mix
DNA template           1µL
Fwd primer            10µL (final con. 10 pM)
Rev primer            10µL
10x thermo pol buffer 10µL
dNTP mix              10µL
DNA pol.               1µL
dH20                  58µL
----------------------------
100µL
PCR cycle
Start: 94 °C for 5 min. (melt) cycle:          melt:            1 min.               anneal :           30 sec.  cycle end: extension:72 °C for 3.5 min.  25 cycles  72 °C for 10 min store: keep at 6 °C forever
Gel extract
Agalose Gel casting
Measure out the appropriate mass of agarose into glass bottle with the appropriate volume of TAE buffer
Microwave until the agarose is fully melted
Pour the agarose solution into the gelbox and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid
Remove comb
Running agalose gel
Load 5 μL prepared 1kbp ladder
Mix DNA solution with loading dye(6x) and water
Load it into agalose gel
Run the gel at ~100 volts for 35 mins.
Visualizing agarose gels
Remove gel from gel box
Soak the gel in ethidium bromide solution
Let it 30 min.
Place the gel in Trans-Illuminator and turn on UV light after make sure the door closing.
Print the picture.
Remove gel and throw in trash
Wipe down Trans-Illuminator if necessary.
Extract
Cut the agarose target band
The chip of the gel into 2mL ADB buffer
Let it in 37 degree 30 min to solve the agarose gel.
Purify the DNA with Zymo DNA Cleam&Concentrator Kit
Dephosphorylation of DNA
SAP: Alkaline Phosphatase (Shrimp)
Mix
DNA fragment 1~10 pmol
shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (1~5 μ l) 1~5 U
10X SAP Buffer 5 μ l
Sterilized distilled water up to 50 μ l
Incubate at 37°C for 15~30 min.
Incubate at 65°C for 15 min. (for inactivation by heat treatment)
Purify the DNA with Zymo DNA Cleam&Concentrator Kit
Ligation
Mix insert DNA with vector DNA.
Add 1u Invitrogen Ligase and Ligase-Buffer(x5).
Store RT for 3h.
Time Delay Test
Transformed sender and receiver into E coli strains.
Inoculated them independently in liquid media. Incubated at 37°C 12h.
Inoculated again in Fresh liquid media upto about OD600=2 at 37°C
Washed  sender and receiver.
Mixed them. (Sender:Receiver=1000μL:1000μL)
Incubated at 25°C, 30°C or 37°C.
Measured intensity of green fluorescence at regular time intervals.(Fluoroskan AscentR FL＆Fluoroskan AscentR Thermo ELECTRON CORPORATION)
