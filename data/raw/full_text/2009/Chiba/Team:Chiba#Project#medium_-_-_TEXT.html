We put Nitro Cellulose filter on these 4 styles of medium and cultured 13 of mutants LuxR each 3 colonies.
After cultivation, the mudium gel with nitro cellulose filter was quarried and layered on 2000 nM AHL containing media with same thickness. Thereafter We obtained the fluorescence pictures.

The No.4 medium afforded the most delayed time among the LuxR mutants.
Namely, the thin medium of agar was better for our animation than the thick medium.
