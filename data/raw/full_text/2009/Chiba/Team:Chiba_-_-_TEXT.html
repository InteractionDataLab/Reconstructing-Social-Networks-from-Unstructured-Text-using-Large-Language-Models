Welcome to the Chiba team Wiki for iGEM 2009!

We introduce Team Chiba to you.  Team Chiba joined iGEM in 2006. Its members belong to The Dep. of Chemistry and so we did not know much biology.  The members therefore had to start from studying the basics of biology. This was the characteristic, but what I believe to be the biggest weak point for the Team.
This year, However, Team Chiba has a member who belongs to the Dep. of biology! He is nothing but an undergraduate student but we expect that the energy of our team will be made better by his existence.
This year's project is making a new version of last year's project. Last year, we tried to devise a series of delay-switches by designing a "switching consortia". We got limited, in success in generating delay swithces, but we think that there is a great deal of room for improvement.
The Registration of our team is very late, in June, and our team has only 5 people. We don't know what will become of our team, but we think the best for our team that all members our team enjoy to the full! Thank you. (Asia iGEM Workshop)
Project - E. coli Time Manager Since 2008
Since 2008, we have been constructing the bacteria timer that "work together".
The mechanism is very simple; (1) the "Transmitter cells" generates the signal molecules, whose concentration gradually increases, (2) when it reaches a certain level, the "Receiver cells" switch on the expression of any given genes. Precise control of the time of delay of this entire process, one can pre-set the time of expression of genetic functions in a predicable manner. By using Asyl-Homoserine Lactones(AHLs) that can freely pass through the cell membrane as signal molecules, the time can be shared, in real time, by all cells within the pot. This way, receiver (timer) cells would take the action all at once in right timing, minimizing the distribution in each cell's response time. This year, we are trying to make a platform for generating an animated pictures using series of new timer cells we have constructed.
