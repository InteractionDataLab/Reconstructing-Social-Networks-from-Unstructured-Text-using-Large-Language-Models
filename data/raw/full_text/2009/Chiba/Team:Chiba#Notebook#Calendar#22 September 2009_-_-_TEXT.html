Today's operation
11:00-
We transplanted E.coli by 48 pins to NC filter and cultured it.
22:30
We transplanted E.coli, which has been cultured on NC filter, to solid medium which contains each concentration of AHL.
AHL concentration is : 0, 10, and 1000 nM
We decided this time is T=0 and observed condition of fluorescence every 30 min.

E. coli Painting (2)
We painted some pictures using excess culture(LuxR Mutant 1) and cultured these.
Pictures are here .
To judge character of LuxR mutants (2)-1
We poured 1 mL of LB-Amp, Cm liquid medium in 96 deep well and added glycerol stocks.
11:45-
We cultured and shook it at 37 degrees Celsius.
23:20-
We transplanted E.coli by 48 pins to NC filter and cultured it.
Examine limit of AHL generation(1)-1
23:00
We did prior culture(JW1908 glycerol stock, plac-LuxI, and 12.5 mL of LB-Amp).
