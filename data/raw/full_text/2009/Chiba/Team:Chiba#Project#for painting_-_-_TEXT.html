To draw more better picture
we screened the "agar media condition" (the thickness & the agar conc.) to enlarge difference in the delay of the LuxR mutant.
Finding more useful condition of medium to demonstrate
We researched the best condition of medium to display our demonstration more clearly.
The protocol of this experiment is here .
About the difference of responce of each reporters
First, we did noted above experiment using GFPuv as reporter. Also we did similar experiment using sfGFP, mRFP, mCherry, and mOrange to judge our mutant LuxR.
As a result, we found that GFPuv is better reporter for our demonstration.
The protocol of this experiment is Distinction of fluorescence protein expression between reporters
