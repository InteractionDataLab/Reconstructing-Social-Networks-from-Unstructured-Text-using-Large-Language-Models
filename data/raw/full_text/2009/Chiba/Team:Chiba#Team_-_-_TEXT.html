What we did
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2009 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Enter information detailing, description of function, standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
Enter this information and other documentation on both the iGEM 2009 wiki and the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K247003, BBa_K247004
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_I731012, BBa_K084012

Safety
For iGEM 2009 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
Specifically, teams should consider the following four questions:
1, Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
No, our project ideas would not raise any safety issues. I think...
2, Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes
3, What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
I don't know.
4, Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No
5, *If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Teams, please document any answers to these (or other) safety questions in your presentation, wiki presentation, or poster.
Judges will be asked to evaluate your project, in part, on the basis of if and how you considered and addressed issues of biological safety.
If any questions arise regarding iGEM and biological safety please send an email to safety AT igem.org.
We participated in these team's survey.
