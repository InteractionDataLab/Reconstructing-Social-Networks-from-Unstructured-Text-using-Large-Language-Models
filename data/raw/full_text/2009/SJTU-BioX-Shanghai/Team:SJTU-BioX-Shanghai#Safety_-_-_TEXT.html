From 2009.igem.org
Project introduction.     Inspired by the natural regulator of circadian bioclock exhibited in most eukaryotic organisms, our team has designed an E.coli-based genetic network with the toxin-antitoxin system so that the bacterium oscillates between two states of dormancy and activity (more...)

Biological safety
These following questions are derived from https://2009.igem.org/Safety .
For iGEM 2009 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
Q1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
Answer 
Our project is about circadian bioclock of bacteria and eukaryotes. It has not been reported by any researcher who studied T-A system yet that the proteins relE, relB, lon, smpB generated by our system will function dangerously in vitro. Besides, other parts are constructed by some biobricks, which are common elements in bacteria. Also, we worked only with non-hazardous E.Coli (BL21& DH10B) and model mammalian cells. We wear lab coats and more than one layer of protective gloves when we do experiments, and operate under fume hoods when our experiment involves volatile chemicals. Our experimental area and relaxing area are spatially seperated. And our wastes released during our experiments will be specially collected and dealt with. Our laboratory also has strict rules to ensure the safety of experimenters and the environment. Therefore, we believe that our project would not raise any safety issue in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety.
Q2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Answer 
No, it is a pity that no such organization exists in our institution, even including our university. As the increasing emphasis on bio-safety, we really need to pay more attention to it. There are more and more cources and lectures on biological safety in recent years, and we would care more about them. We will set up a biosafety committee in the near future.
Q3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Answer 
Temporary unavailable.
Q4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
Answer 
None of our Biobricks would be disruptive to the health of researchers or the general public. In addition, our comprehensive biowaste management policies ensure that none of our biological wastes ever cause damage to the environment.
