An E.coli-based oscillator of prokaryotic bioclock
Inspired by the natural regulator of circadian bioclock exhibited in most eukaryotic organisms, our team has designed an E.coli-based genetic network with the toxin-antitoxin system so that the bacterium oscillates between the states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of this project include the preservation of frequently-mutating bacteria, biologic timing, antibiotic resistance, etc. [more...]
E.coli the napper : our original idea is to build up an inner bioclock mastering sleep rhythem (which can only be found in higher organisms) in E.coli
