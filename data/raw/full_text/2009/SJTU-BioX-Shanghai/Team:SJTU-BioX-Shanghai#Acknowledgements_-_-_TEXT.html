Bio-X Center , Shanghai Jiaotong University(SJTU) is recombined by NHGG(Neuropsychiatric and Human Genetics Group) and Bio-X Biology Science research Base in 2005. The director of Bio-X Center now is Professor Lin He , who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Bio-X Center offers us its laboratory, meeting room and equipments in Bones and Developmental Biology Base of Minhang Campus, which is quite easy and convienent for us to start an experiment or a meeting as we wish. Meanwhile, it supports us 3 instructors and many nice postgraduates to help with our designing and experiments.

With the support from our directors, our team get enough funding for our project.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library
With its humble origin as a small reading room built in 1896 upon the establishment of the Nan Yang Public School, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) Library is one of the most venerable university libraries in China today.
Meeting room in our library
With a total area of 63,700 m2, SJTU Library system currently comprises a number of branches covering a wide range of fields on natural and social science and technology, including affiliated libraries and reading rooms housed in different schools and departments. Equipped with rich resources and state of the art facilities, SJTU Library is now an open and integrated service system that facilitates and promotes research initiatives in all areas.
Our library provides us a meeting room for group meeting. With the help of it, we can be easily gathered together from the reading rooms and start a discussion easily.
Thanks to all the sponsors listed above, we can get the achievment in the end.
