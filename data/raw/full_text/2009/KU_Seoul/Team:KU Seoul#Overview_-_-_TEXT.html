Overview
Integrated Heavy Metal Detection System
Our team project is designing synthetic modules for simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metals such as
arsenic, zinc, and cadmium in E. coli. The ultimate goal is to build a micromachine sensing and determining of
the concentration of heavy metals in a sample solution (e.g. the waste water). In order to design the system,
we will employ two fluorescence proteins (GFP and RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. Since each
heavy metal promoter produces unique fluorescence or color by those reporters, if more than two heavy metals
coexist in a solution, the results would be interpreted from the convoluted fluorescence and/or color rather
than a single signal detection. The successful construction of the synthetic modules in E. coli can be utilized
in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable.
STEP1, Prepare plasmids.
STEP2. Gene cloning & Infusion Biobrick assembly(SLIC)
Using the SLIC method, infuse the biobricks inside of plasmid. There are two inserts just made through SLIC method.
STEP3.measuring the concentration of heavy metal
This picture is showing cadimum detection. Another case is similar to this experiments.
