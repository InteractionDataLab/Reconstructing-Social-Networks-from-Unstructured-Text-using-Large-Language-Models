Hello~ World!!! This is our first time applying for the iGEM and we are EXCITED!!!
We are a team of 10 undergraduate students from Korea University, South Korea.  The current project we are working on is metal detecting bacteria, through which we are trying to sense  harmful metal ions inside water and see if it is suitable for drinking. We mainly discuss our ideas through Google in Korean and then post the results on wiki.
