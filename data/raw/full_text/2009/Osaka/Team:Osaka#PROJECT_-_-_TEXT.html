PROJECT
Overview
In 1933, Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1927, exhibited his ‘germ paintings’. It was the origin of “Bio Art” that represents a crossover of art and the biological sciences with genes, proteins, cells and animals. Fleming’s early works were reductively judged in the terms of its aesthetic criteria, beauty. In this year, our project consists of two interrelated themes.
1. We try to create a new tool for “germ paintings” by integrating cell-to-cell communication with motility and color.
>>See COLOR , SIGNAL and MOTILITY
2. We make art works using genetic engineered bacteria. Through making art works, we also consider biomedia and bioethics in the context of synthetic biology.
>>See WORKS and ETHICS
Such artworks can give rise to a number of issues and metaphors accompanying the advance of science and technology. Because bio art is still at the threshold of definition, there are few interdisciplinary works such as collaborations between bio-artists and synthetic biologists. Given this condition, we will try to accomplish the interactive evolution of "ColrColi (biological painting tool)" and "BioArt".
Conceptual diagram below this sentence shows the relationship between Colrcoli and BioArt. While making Colrcoli will lead enhancement of tool's limitation and stimulate creator's imagination, through BioArt we might found practical requirements for biological painting tool. Thus, both BioArt and Colrcoli will go on with effects of results from the counter-part.
