Symbol
Our symbol is well geometrically defined and have multilayered meanings. About its meanings, appearance of our logo symbolizes the O of our city OSAKA. And four colors E-colis means our theme "Be colorful!" and they have specific and unique messages each other. Red E-coli means "Passion",  blue E-coli means "Intelligence", green E-coli means "Friends" and yellow E-coli means "Inspiration". These four elements are always needed in scientific research and iGEMworks.
