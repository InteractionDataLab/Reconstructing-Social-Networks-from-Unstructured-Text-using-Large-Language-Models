Material and Methods
Preparing CaCl2competent cell
Pick a single colony (strain -> Nova Blue) and inoculate 5 ml LB
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Inoculate 30 ml LB with 1ml of o/n preculture in sterile 100 ml erlenmeyer
Incubate culture at 37°C on a shaker up to OD600=0.3~0.5 (Measure OD value first 1hr and each 30min)
When the culture reaches an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.5, transfer the culture into 50 centrifugation tube(sterile)
On ice for 10min
Centrifuge:8krpm,5min,4°C
Discard supernatant
Resuspend each pellet in 20 ml chilled 0.1 M MgCl2 and add further 15 ml 0.1 M MgCl (total 45 ml)
On ice for 10min
Centrifuge:8krpm,5min,4℃
Discard supernatant
Resuspend each pellet in 20 ml chilled 0.1 M CaCl2 and add further 15 ml 0.1 M MgCl (total 45 ml)
On ice 30min
Centrifuge:8krpm,5min,4℃
Discard supernatant carefuly
Resuspend each pellet in 750 µl pre-chilled 0.1 M CaCl2 and 750 µl pre-chilled 50%(v/v) Glycerol
Aliquot 500~100 ul of the mix into sterile microfuge tubes that are pre-chiled at -80℃
stock at -80℃
Transformation of chemical competent cell
Thaw competent cells on ice
Mix 2~5 ul pDNA and 100 ul competent cells in 1.5 ml pre-chiled sterile tube
On ice for 30min
Heat shock 42℃ for 2~1min
On ice for 5min
Add 900 ul LB
Incubate at 37℃ for 1hour (During this, warm plates at 42℃)
Harvest cells by centrifuge (14krpm, 1min, r.t.)
Discard 900~800 ul of supernatant
Resuspend pellet by pipetting
Plating all cells on the plate with appropriate antibiotics by glass beads
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Watch the plate and find colony
Plasmid mini prep (QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit)
Pick a single colony from transformed cells and inoculate 5 ml LB with the appropriate selective antibiotics (Amp->5 ul, Kan->25 ul)
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Harvest the cells by centrifugation 13krpm, 1min, r.t.
Resuspend pelleted cells in 250 ul Buffer P1. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet. So, pipetting an vortex well!.P1 buffer must be stocked at 4°C
Add 250 ul Buffer P2 and inventing the tubes 4-6times
Add 350 ul Buffer N3 and inventing the tubes 4-6times soon after step 5
Centrifuge:15krpm, 10min, 4°C
Transfer the supernatants to the Ecospin column (economical..) or QlAprep spin column by pipetting
Centrifuge: 13krpm, 1min, r.t.
Reapply the flow-through to column for improving yield
Centrifuge: 13krpm, 1min, r.t. and discard the flow-through
Add 500 ul Buffer PB in column
Centrifuge: 13krpm, 1min, r.t. and discard the flow-through
Add 750 ul Buffer PE in column
Centrifuge: 13krpm, 1min, r.t. and discard the flow-through
Centrifuge: 14krpm, 3min, r.t. to remove residual wash buffer. And then, discard the flow-through
Place the column in a clean 1.5 ml tube. Add 100~50 ul Buffer EB or sterile water to the center of each column
Keep at r.t. for 3~5min
Centrifuge:15krpm, 1min
stock -30°C
Restriction Digestion
For cloning experiments, the final volume should be 20 or 50
