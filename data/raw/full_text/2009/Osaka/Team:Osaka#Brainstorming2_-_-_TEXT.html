Operation
Cell to Cell communication (Quorum sensing)
orthogonal cell-cell signaling will be required for our ART painting
Existing systems->
LuxI-LuxR
LasI-LasR
ciniI-cinR
RhII-RhIR
Evaluate diffuse of signals - PoPs, RiPs and Degradation
Timer or counter(optional addon)
well known genetic circuit
light or sound induced?
Output -pattern and painting-
patterning
we have to control the motility of E.coli or salmonella on soft-agar plate
Stop rotation of flagella motor
use molecular clutch (iGEM08 Imperial college) [ [1] ]
->However, this parts was characterized only in butilus.
Stop viased random walk
express che?
Stop flagellar assembly
use the strain that lacks flagella gene. But Inactivating auto inducer will be needed!
Art Challange
no team had done this theme. Ethics and environmental issue was emphasized.
