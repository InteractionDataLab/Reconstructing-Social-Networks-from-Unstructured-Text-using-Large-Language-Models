MOTILITY
♥ Construction of new parts, FliH( K204500 , K2045002 , K2045003 ).
♥ Confirmation of expected effect of our parts on swarming motility and protein secretion of cell.
>>Detail for MOTILITY
WORKS & ETHICS
♦ Created a lot of Bio Art works that has implication to biotechnology, bioethics and biomedia.
♦ Discussed Bio Art with respect to biomedia and bioethics in the context of synthetic biology. And proposed newfangled ethical implication between science and art.

Entertainment
iCEM
S. Nakamura & K. Ikeda suggested and planed social event iCEM this year. Collaborating with other committee members, we will entertain your night life in Boston. Why don't you join us?
Future work
Synthetic Biology
We don't know whether we will participate in iGEM 2010 or not. However if you are interested in synthetic or systems biology or social event, please contact us with high motivation, intelligence, special skill, will power, meddling, and fluent communication or nominication skill.
Bio Art
We plan to continue our bio Art work if we afford it. If you interested in Bio Art, please join us and make it.
