Team:USTC/Notebook/Lab Work/29 July 2009
I cannot be more miserable than today. I thought I had made clear the main structure of Primer3, and I began to add something or change something in its codes to serve our purpose. However, the work aimed to alteration is totally related to details. What I have learned is just its whole structure and little part of its details. So, I almost made no progress today. Actually, I wrote several functions in its codes, the problem is the same parameter may hold different meanings in my function and its origin function--a problem of communication. I was really annoyed. Hao Jiang, one of graduates in our team, gives me a lot of help, and he is reading the codes now.
Tomorrow I will go on the alteration.
