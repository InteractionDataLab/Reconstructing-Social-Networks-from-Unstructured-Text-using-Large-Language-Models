About USTC_Software
A bunch of energetic young guys bumping into each other in pursuit of the truth of life, and this is basically the essential reason why we are here now.
This year, we are much more populated than before. This not only gets solid proof from the increasing coverage of participants' number, but also can be demonstrsted by the big variance among participants' backgrounds. The 2009 iGEM team of USTC, well, if we just count the dry team, consists of two graduate students and four undergraduates. Our major varies from  electrnic engineering to condensed matter physics, from geophysics to computational biology. By such a colorful combination, anything exciting could be possible relying on our brotherhood. We feel so lucky to get acquaintance with each other and really enjoy all the funny days we are together. We will enjoy the days in MIT, just join us!

We have FUN!
iGEM is fun! And even when the 'wetness' is drained, fun remains the same for 'dryness'. We and the USTC wet team work together to help find inspirations and fun. Here follows snapshots of those happy moments.
