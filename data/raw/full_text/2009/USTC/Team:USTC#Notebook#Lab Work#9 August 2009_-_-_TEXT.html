The work has almost been finished! The preliminary PCR-primer biobricks have been designed, and we will choose 7 better ones from 15~20 primers to synthesize.

K176036 in pSB1A3: correct but 1-45bp overlap peaks and the counting-backwards 50bps overlap peaks.
K176036 in pSB1A3: correct.
K176035 in pSB1A3: incorrect, G1344A in ccdB mutated.
K176035 in pSB1A3: correct but the counting-backwards 50bps are unclear.
K176079 in pSB1A3: result shows that it is K176075, 1-936bp correct.
K176071 in pSB1A3: 1-936bp incorrect. C143A, G678T, in tetR mutated.
K176075 in pSB1A3: result shows that it is K176079. 1-70bp correct. overlap peaks after that. Perhaps there are two kinds of plasmid.
