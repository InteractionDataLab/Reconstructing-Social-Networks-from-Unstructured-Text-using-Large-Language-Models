Team:USTC/Notebook/Lab Work/28 July 2009
Nothing exciting happened today. I try to change the functions in Primer3 to make this mature software fit our purpose, but it seems much more difficult than I have imagined. The origin idea of adding something to the structure definition have been proved to be a method leading to terrible complexity. I tried an alternative later, and this work will continue tomorrow. If this method of alteration cannot serve our purpose of designing PCR-primer biobricks, I will write the codes of the program myself using some functions of Primer3.
