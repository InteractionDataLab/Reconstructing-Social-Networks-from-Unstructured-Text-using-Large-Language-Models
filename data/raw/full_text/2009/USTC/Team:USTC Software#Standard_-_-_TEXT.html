Kinetic Parameters Identification
First of all, we shall clarify that, being dedicated to dry lab experiments, we naturally doesn't have as many incarnated Bio-Parts as usual wet labs do.
In wet lab experiment, kinetic parameters are notorious for their difficulties to be obtained quantitatively. To construct a well fabricated device, the kinetic parameters are crucial for an extensible part. When certain parts are placed in the network, certain biochemical reactions with holding kinetic parameters are introduced. To identify kinetic parameters of basic devices determines the extensibility of devices.
Model 2
is a subsystem of Model 3 .
Model 2 and Model 3 from 2009 USTC Wet Team
Here we put forward another feasible way to define dynamic parameters of biochemical reactions, and further characterization of single biobrick and combined bio-devices, in terms of chemical dynamics view.
Data Sheet and Related Construction.

Another Definition of Reaction Parameters
By constructing the two interwined database, we can easily retrieve chemical dynamics parameters, match reactions or substances, traverse possibly extended bio-network or reaction network. Above all, we can retrieve enough information to abstract the real, substential system to soundly built linear/nonlinear ODE array system, based on which, we can predict behavior, modify choices and make suggestions.
Though there does exist quite a lot of standard protocols and techniques depicting measurements to quantify bio-chemical reaction parameters under strictly defined reacting environment, the high cost and usually mediocre outcome still can hardly live up to prople's needs. Now assume the modeling has enough precision of simulation/identification, we can loose the strict requirements of reaction system and leave the addtional complexity originated from loosen conditions to the program, and choose experimental data from a much wider range of reactions to 'fit' the 'true' reaction parameters. And this is our basic idea to propose a new way to identify reaction parameters by means of system identification and reverse engineering.
Choose a reaction network contaning the desired interaction parameters. Note that the reactants and products must exist in databse constructed above.
Search substances to find all possible reactions in the bio-network.
For each substance, every reaction will contribute none or one term of interaction at the right end of the ODE equation concerning this substance with respect to reaction's type recorded in reaction database.
Build up the ODE array to fully describe the reaction network.
Identify parameters of every term in the ODE array with accordance to the experimental data of the time course of the network's all substances' concentration. Algorithm might involve classical system identification and reverse engineering.
The identified parameters, if fall in between acceptable error region after repeated identifications, can be accepted as a standard parameter of coressponding substance.
