Team Description
We work together, create together, have fun together, persue dream together! What we have is passoin and courage, what we pursue is challenge and creation. We are a family more than a team, we are brothers and sisters more than schoolmates!
We will keep every single laughter in mind as well as dismay and frustration. We miss those days when heated discussion took place to determine proceeding plans and those nights when we repeat experiments to figure out puzzles. What we finally get is much more than the project E.ADEM, but friendship, courage, strength and happiness.
