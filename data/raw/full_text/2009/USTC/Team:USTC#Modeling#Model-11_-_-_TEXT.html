We employed an ODE model. In this system,we assumed the synthesis rate of TetR, LuxR, cI and LuxI were totally decided by the Promoter before them, and the concentration of them were constant.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S11-4), (Recation S11-5), (Recation S11-10), (Recation S11-12), (Recation S11-14), (Recation S11-15), (Recation S11-16), (Recation S11-17)  and (Recation S11-18) were considered to be able to get balance in a very short time.
In above equations, all parameters could be obtained from our previous models. For instance, the kkk was estiamted in the Simplified Model-3 , the kk was calculated in the Simplified Model-2 , and the k21, rAHLin were available in Simplified Model-5 . The PoPScI cloud be calculated in Simplified Model-6 , dependenting on the PoPS before it.
