Team:USTC/Notebook/Lab Work/2 August 2009
I finished the job of altering Primer3. The changed software can produce a large number of primers randomly, and then it helps search the correct primers according to user's requirements. However, now we are considering another problem about PCR-primer biobricks--the similarity and complement between the randomly-produced primers.
