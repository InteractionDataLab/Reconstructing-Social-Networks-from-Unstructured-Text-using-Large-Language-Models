Measurement protocol
Constitutive promoter measurements
1. Streak a LB plate of the strain which contain one of the parts listed in pSB1A3 .
2. Inoculate two 3ml cultures of supplemented M9 Medium and antibiotic( Ampicillin 0.1mg/ml) with single colony from the plate.
3. Cultures were grown in test tubes（BIO BASIC INC.12ml Polypropylene Round-bottom Culture Tubes With Graduations And Dual Cap Cat.No:TD444） for 16hrs at 37℃ with shaking at 200rpm.
4. Cultures were diluted 1:100 into 3ml fresh medium and grown for 3hrs.
5. Measure the fluorescence(SHIMDZU SPECTROFLUOROPHOTOMETER RF-5301PC, 250ul quartz cell path length 10mm,501 nm excitation,514 nm emission,1.5nm slit width) and absorbance (HITACHI UV-VIS spectrophotometer U-2810 ,200ul quartz cell,path length 10mm,600nm,1.5 nm slit width) every 30 minutes in the next 4hrs.
Hybrid promoter response to AHL
1. Streak a LB plate of the strain which contain one of the parts listed in pSB1A3 .
2. Inoculate two 3ml cultures of supplemented M9 Medium and antibiotic(Ampicillin 0.1mg/ml) with single colony from the plate.
3. Cultures were grown in test tubes（BIO BASIC INC.12ml Polypropylene Round-bottom Culture Tubes With Graduations And Dual Cap Cat.No:TD444） for 16hrs at 37℃ with shaking at 200rpm.
4. Cultures were diluted 1:1000 to tubes of 3ml fresh medium and grown for 4.5hrs.
5. Stock concentration of the cognate AHL, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine is diluted and added to different tubes to yield different final concentrations      (1E-5,1E-7,1E-8,1E-9,1E-10M).To ensure the same response time , the AHL should be added with a time interval of 2mins between tubes, so do the measurements procedure.
6. Measure the fluorescence(SHIMDZU SPECTROFLUOROPHOTOMETER RF-5301PC, 250ul quartz cell path length 10mm,501 nm excitation,514 nm emission,1.5nm slit width) and absorbance ((HITACHI UV-VIS spectrophotometer U-2810 ,200ul quartz cell path length 10mm,600nm,1.5 nm slit width)  for the first time 30 minutes after adding AHL. Repeat measurement every 30 mins in the next 4hrs.
Hybrid promoter response to AHL&aTc
1. Streak a LB plate of the strain which contain one of the parts listed in pSB1A3 .
2. Inoculate two 3ml cultures of supplemented M9 Medium and antibiotic(Ampicillin 0.1mg/ml) with single colony from the plate.
3. Cultures were grown in test tubes（BIO BASIC INC.12ml Polypropylene Round-bottom Culture Tubes With Graduations And Dual Cap Cat.No:TD444） for 16hrs at 37℃ with shaking at 200rpm.
4. Cultures were diluted 1:1000 to 11 tubes 3ml fresh medium and grown for 4.5hrs.
5. Stock concentration of the cognate AHL, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine and aTc (anhydrotetracycline) are diluted and added to different tube to get different final concentrations listed in the table below:

To ensure the same response time , the AHL and aTc should be added with a time interval of 2mins between tubes, so do the measurements procedure.

Repeat measurement several hours a time until OD600 reach to 0.8,it will take about 7hours in average.

Standard
This standard defines the measurement of the PoPS of a specific Biobrick. It defines how to measure  PoPS in a relative unit , not a absolute value.
Strains:
The system should be measured in the strain of Top10.
Plasmid:
The Biobrick parts measured must be supplied in the plasmid pSB1A3.
Reporter:
The Part BBa_I13504 is chosen as the reporter of all the PoPS output of a Biobrick.
Medium:
The cultures should be grown in the M9 medium. The recipe of M9 medium :
1X  M9 salts:
Na2HSO4 33.9g/L
KaH2SO4 15g/L
NaCl 2.5g/L
NH4Cl 5g/L
Dissolve in 1L H2O
1mM thiamine hydrochloride ;
0.4% glycerol ;
0.2% casamino acids ;
2mM MgSO4 ;
0.1mM CaCl2 ;
Measurement detail
a.  Colonies should be picked from a streaked LB plate and grown for 16~18hrs. Growth condition:37℃,200rpm.
b. Dilute the culture 1:100 when measure a constitutive promoter and 1:1000 for a regulatable promoter.
c. The culture should be grown for 3~4hrs before the measurement begin.
d. Measure fluorescence and OD600 in at most 30mins after sampling.
e. For the regulatable promoter , it is necessary to ensure the same response time. The time interval between
the stimulation and measurement should be exactly the same.
f. All the measurement should be made in the linear range of the equipments. It is necessary to test it before
your experiment.
Data process:
a. A  relative fluorescence unit ustc_st.1 is defined to describe the fluorescence intensity independent from the measurement equipment.
b. The part BBa_ K176009 is selected as the fluorescence standard. The fluorescence intensity of BBa_K176009 was measured as the cultures were grown.
c. Define flu,od as the raw data of fluorescence intensity and OD600. Fit flu/od value correspondent to OD600. Take the correspondent value of flu/od to OD600=0.5 std as the defined standard  1000 units.
d. All the other raw data
should be converted to standard flu/od value as shown in equation(1):
