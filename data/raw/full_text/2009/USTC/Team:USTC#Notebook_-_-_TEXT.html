Preliminary work
From Feb.4th to Feb.13th, a collective training is held targeting to the practice of basic experiment. Setting GFP protein expression system as an example, we learn from the program how to construct standard components and then an expression system. It`s the time we get to know each other and become a team as a whole.
The contents of the training are listed as followed:
1. outlines
2. E.coli culture (Medium preparation, Inoculation, Aseptic operation)
3. plasmid extraction
4. PCR
5. electrophoresis
6. enzyme cutting
7. reclaim and appraise of the product of enzyme cutting
8. connexin
9. preparation of competent cell
10.  genomic screening of masculine clone
11.  DNA sequencing
we also systemize the former work of iGEM teams and make a summary during winter vocation, which can be found in

Meetings
Meetings are set every Saturday since Feb.15th, then three more discussions (Mon, Wes, Fri) are added when we start to determine our project since Mar 21th.
2009.2.10 – 2009.3.14  reports of the former iGEM works
2009.3.21 – 2009.4.11  broach of candidate projects
cell density control
Reporter and imaging
DNA writing and reading in the cell
Biodegradation of plastics
2009.4.18 – 2009.5.03  further research by small groups on the candidate projects
2009.5.03 sketch map of our final project E.ADEM was set up
2009.5.03 - recent metlab experience began and every progress reported and discussed
All the reports information, slides and audio records of our meetings are arranged here.
