Simplified Model-3
To get the datails of the model-processing, click Simplified Model-2
We employed an ODE model. We defined the input to be AHLout the and the output to be the synthesis rate of mature GFP.
To simplify the model, the (Recation S3-3), (Recation S3-4), (Recation S3-5),(Recation S3-13) and (Recation S3-14) were considered to be able to get balance in a very shortly time.
Conbining the data from our measurements and the parameters estimated in Simplified Model-2 ,  we could be able to get the parameter kkk, k11, k12, k13, k14, k15, k16.
