-Colony PCR of cells transformed with previous ligations
-PCR to add KpnI and BamHI sites to GFP
-Spectrophotometry of dbcOmega strains in ATCC media
-PCR to add BioBrick prefix and suffix to Cph8 and pRKCBC3
-Transformed S17 competent cells to check efficiency.  OD = 0.115
-Performed Triligation and Silver Lab Ligations to fuse OmpC+GFP
-Started cultures of dbcOmega in LB+Strep in lieu of ATCC
