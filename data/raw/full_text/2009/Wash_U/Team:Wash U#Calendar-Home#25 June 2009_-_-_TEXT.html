-Restreaked sphaeroides plates and plated from liquid cultures.  We are working on getting rid of contamination on the earlier plates and in cultures.
-Waiting on supplies from Sigma Aldrich!
-Working on our webpage.... We have viewers from 4 continents!
-Minipreps of biobrick plasmid DNA (cultures from Th. 6/18)
-Overnight PCR with miniprepped DNA, to check for inserts
DNA nanospec concentrations (ng/microliter):
1) 22.2
2) 51.4
3) 135
4) 75.9
5) 81.4
6) 31.1
7) 49.6
8) 35.9
9) 62.9
