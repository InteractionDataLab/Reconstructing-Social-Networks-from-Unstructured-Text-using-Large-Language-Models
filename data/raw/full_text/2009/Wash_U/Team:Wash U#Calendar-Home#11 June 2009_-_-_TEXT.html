Characterization of System
(1) -puc Promoter via GFP (inserted with primers)  -want high expression (denotes high conc. of light sensor) (2) -control: puc-OmpR-Term + OmpC-GFP  (test native phosphorylation of OmpR) (3) –measurement: puc-Cph8-OmpR-Term + OmpC-GFP (test synthetic phos. of OmpR) -combination of puc and ompc characterization will give expression rates of  puc, ompR, and how they integrate -compare natural R. sph. absorbance to new altered strain (LH2 levels)  -extent and development rate -strength of native RBS -switch-on, switch-off behavior over time (step inputs of light)  -measured in both GFP fluorescence setup and LH2 absorbance -degradation of LH2?
