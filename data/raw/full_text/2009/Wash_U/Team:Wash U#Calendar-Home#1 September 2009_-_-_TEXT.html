A
RBS30_cph8
168.0
B
ompR_term_ompC_GFP
161.0
C
ompR_term_ompC_pucB/A
188.0
Did 2 digests of RBS30_cph8 with 1.5 ug each according to prefix-insertion instructions from the Silver lab- cut with EcoRI and PstI  (A1 and A2)
Did 1 digest each of 1.5 ug of ompR_term_ompC_GFP (B) and ompR_term_ompC_pucB/A (C) as the vector for prefix insertion- cut with EcoRI and XbaI.
The Results of this digest are:
The first 4 lanes are the two rxns for RBS30_cph8.  The top band is the one that was cutout (ab. 2.3 kb)
The next 2 lanes are ompR_term_ompC_GFP  and the last two are ompR_term_ompC_pucB/A
Concentrations: of products after Gel purification:
A1) A2) B) C)
The products were ligated in the following ratios after gel purification for 1 hr at 22 deg C, followed by 20 min at 80 deg C:
