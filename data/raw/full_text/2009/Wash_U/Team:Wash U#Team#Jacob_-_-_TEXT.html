Jacob is a senior molecular biology and biochemistry major at WashU.  He is a nerd and enjoys thinking about potential applications for factoids that he picks up in his Bio courses and online, which led him to discover "Synthetic Biology".  He is also interested in entrepreneurship, writing, '60s music, the outdoors, and ideas of all shapes, sizes, and insanities.
