BioBrick Assembly
- Attempted first BioBrick ligation of ompC promoter and GFP into plasmid psB1K3
- Used the official BioBrick Assembly Protocol from NEB
Spectrophotometry Data
- Wild type Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.41 was contrasted with dbcOmega, an LH2 knockout strain, via spectrophotometry sweep from 300 to 950 nm.
-In the negative second derivative plots, peaks denote regions of downward concavity.  The LH2 knockout strain lacks the 800 and 850nm peaks apparent in the Wild Type, yet retains the LH1 peak near 875nm.
