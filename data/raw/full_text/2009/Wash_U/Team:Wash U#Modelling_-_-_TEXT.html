Modeling the Gene Regulatory Network
Our group seeks to assess the optimality of the synthetic system that modulates pucBA gene expression and LH2 complex assembly in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.  Here we employ a mathematical model of this system to generate predictions about the behavior of the active system in response to light input. Features of the system that the model may help investigate include the time scale of response to light signals, the robustness of the system in response to fluctuations in light intensity, and the translation between changes in gene expression and the absorbance spectrum of the engineered cells.
