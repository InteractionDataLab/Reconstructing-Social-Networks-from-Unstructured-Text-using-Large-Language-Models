The <B>Imaging device</B> is also one of our featured parts.
</P><P>
The <B>device</B> consists of mainly pTet regulated expression of IFP &amp; HO-1, which in turn generate a unique fluorescence signal in the infrared spectrum!
</P><P><B>We are extremely pleased to report that we have successfully converted this novel reporter protein into a standard Biobrick!</B> Let us now see how exactly the device works.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Abstract"> Abstract </SPAN></H2><P>As part of the imaging capability we want for our system, we have eschewed traditional reporter proteins like GFP or YFP and have identified a novel reporter protein, infrared fluorescent protein (IFP). A recent work by Xiaokun et al. (Tsien Lab, UCSD) has shown successful mammalian expression of infrared fluorescent protein engineered from a bacterial phytochrome. Xiaokun et al. have also expressed the infrared fluorescent protein in <I>E. coli</I> strain TOP10.
</P><P>IFP is preferred for our system over other fluorescent proteins such as GFP or YFP because it has unique excitation and emission maxima, which fit so well with the wavelength range of typical <I>in vivo</I> optical imaging in deep tissues of animals. At wavelength range between 650 and 900 nm, the absorbance by haemoglobin, water and lipids, as well as light-scattering are minimal.
</P><P><B>Therefore, IFP is particularly suitable for our ideal system as we desire to locate the atherosclerotic plaque site non-invasively.</B></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Background"> Background </SPAN></H2><P>Our <B>p</B>Laq<I>U</I><SPAN class="sup">e</SPAN> Out! system must be capable of highlighting the atherosclerotic plaque site upon detection by the preceding sensing mechanism of nitric oxide sensing promoter (pNO). The first thing that came to our mind was the variety of known fluorescent proteins (FPs) such as GFP, RFP, YFP, CFP. However, since our ultimate environment for our <B>p</B>Laq<I>U</I><SPAN class="sup">e</SPAN> Out! system is <I>in vivo</I>, we envisioned an ideal system that can express a novel reporter protein with properties suitable for <I>in vivo</I> optical imaging. IFP was chosen as a potential candidate.
</P><P>The gene encoding IFP used in our expression system is essentially the gene for IFP1.4. Xiaokun et al. obtained IFP1.4  by saturation, random mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling of a gene encoding IFP1.0; and it was shown to be about four times brighter than IFP1.0.
</P><P>Overall, IFP has an excitation and emission maxima of 684 nm and 708 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission maxima for other fluorescent proteins have not exceeded 598 and 655 nm, respectively.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mechanism"> Mechanism </SPAN></H3><P>Infrared fluorescent protein is a monomeric protein engineered from a bacterial phytochrome of the species <I>Deinococcus radiodurans</I>.
</P><P>This bacteriophytochrome incorporates biliverdin IXα (BV) as the chromophore. Biliverdin IXα is in fact a natural product of heme catabolism by the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). BV is essential because in a mouse experiment conducted by Xiaokun et al., BV has been shown to increase the infrared fluorescence to a maximal fivefold 1 hour after BV injection in the mouse with exogenously added BV.
</P><P>In a phone call made to Dr. Xiaokun Shu, we have also been told that BV helps to stabilize the infrared fluorescent protein. Hence, it is essential that we incorporate HO-1 into our system to generate biliverdin IXα.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Construct_Design"> Construct Design </SPAN></H2><P>As you recall, our ideal system is designed to be in a T-helper cell chassis. However, for infrared fluorescent protein production purposes, we have used <I>E. coli</I> strain K12 as our model system. In order to realize the production system, we have incorporated two parts into the device: the genes encoding infrared fluorescent protein (IFP) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). 
</P><P>
The <B>Imaging Device</B> is designed to function only in low [NO] conditions (i.e. in atherosclerotic plaque sites):
</P><P>
After TetR repression stops at plaque site with low [NO], both HO-1 &amp; IFP are produced. The HO-1 catalyzes the conversion of haem to biliverdin, which then binds to IFP to allow generation of infrared signal. Once infrared signalling has begun, we can begin imaging for the plaque site using conventional imaging modality, and establish the location of the plaque site.
</P><P><B>Of course, at this stage we also foresee numerous other medical/non-medical uses for the IFP protein!</B></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Characteristic_Equations"> Characteristic Equations </SPAN></H3><P><B>Transcription of IFP / HO-1</B></P><P>First, we can define the stoichiometric ratio of IFP to HO-1 transcribed.
</P><P>
Next, we establish the deterministic repression-regulated transcription rate of IFP &amp; HO-1.
</P><P>Where V<SPAN class="sub">max</SPAN> is max transcription rate &amp; D<SPAN class="sub">m</SPAN> is the degradation rate of mRNA.
</P><P><SPAN class="grey">Again, bracketed term generates the fraction of pTet not bound with TetR i.e. actively promoting pTet sites.</SPAN></P><P><B>Translation of IFP / HO-1</B></P><P>Deterministic first order ODE is used again to represent the translation of IFP / HO-1 protein. <I>Same eqn with appropriate term and constants changed.</I></P><P>Where K<SPAN class="sub">tl</SPAN> is the translation rate of mRNA &amp; D<SPAN class="sub">p</SPAN> is the degradation rate of IFP / H0-1 protein.
</P><P><B>Infrared signal production</B></P><P>Before the infrared signal can be produced, HO-1 must first convert haem to biliverdin.
</P><P>
And then finally we can determine an equation for rate of infrared signal, (assuming that intensity of infrared signal is directly proportional to the amount of bound-IFP-biliverdin in the system).
</P><P> based on the ratio of bound / activated to total [IFP] available: </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Modelling_.26_Simulation"> Modelling &amp; Simulation </SPAN></H3><P>We make the following assumptions:
</P><OL><LI> Biological systems of transcription and translation are assumed to be linear and time-invariant.
</LI><LI> Concentration of the haem is considered to be non-limiting.
</LI><LI> There is no time lag between expression &amp; activity.
</LI><LI> Constant Degradation rates for mRNA as well as protein.
</LI><LI> Intensity of infrared signal is directly proportional to [IFP-BV] complex.

A test construct (<B>J23119-RBS-IFP-T-J23119-RBS-HO1-T</B>) was constructed for this purpose.
</P><P>
The first approach is by running <B>agarose gel electrophoresis</B> of the double digested plasmids and PCR products to verify the correct DNA fragment size as well as the presence of HO-1 and IFP genes in the test construct.

Lane 8 is the size of pSB1A2 vector in which the final construct resides.

The production of IFP in our imaging device was confirmed by SDS-PAGE on a NuPAGE® Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel. Protein ladder used is BenchMark™ Protein Ladder (Invitrogen Cat. No. 10747-012).
</P><P><B>SDS-PAGE to test for the presence of IFP protein.</B></P><P><SPAN class="grey">The first lane is the negative control, followed by our construct: J23119-R-IFP-T-J23119-R-HO1-T and the third lane is the positive control, using the sample from Tsien’s Lab. The band corresponding to the size of IFP is pointed as in the figure (for positive control). The result suggests that IFP is indeed present in our sample. The vector for the positive control is pBAD which is an inducible over-expression vector. Hence this may explain the difference in the intensities of both bands corresponding to our construct and the positive control.</SPAN></P><P>
To further verify that IFP is produced, <B>Optical Imaging  Experiments</B> with the appropriate optical instruments for the detection of the infrared fluorescence emission of our constructs are also conducted repeatedly. The excitation and emission maxima of IFP are 684 and 708 nm, respectively; thus, our experimental setup must be equipped with the appropriate optical components that are of this wavelength range. Optical Imaging  Experiments are extensively discussed in the following section. Our positive control for all the detection of infrared fluorescence emission is cell culture containing plasmids which ware generously provided by Tsien’s Lab.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Optical_Experiment_Setup"> Optical Experiment Setup </SPAN></H3><P>As most of commercial optical experiment setups are not equipped with excitation and emission filters of wavelengths that are in our desired range, we resorted to a customized optical experimental setup. With this in mind, we had collaborated with <B>Prof. Lee Kijoon</B> on the fluorescence imaging.
</P><P><B>Ocean Optics USB-4000 Portable Spectrometer</B></P><P>A <B>660 nm Melles Griot 56ICS254/HS plus 56IMA022 laser</B> is used as the light source. The 660 nm laser source fits almost perfectly with the ideal excitation maximum at 684 nm.
</P><P>We shine the 660 nm laser onto our four-hour re-inoculated cell culture. The <B>Ocean Optics USB-4000 Portable Spectrometer</B> detects any signal emitted by the cell culture with an optical fiber connected to the spectrometer. The optical fiber is pointed and directed towards the cell culture for signal receiving.
</P><P>In order to block the excitation light from entering the spectrometer, we included <B>Semrock FF665-Di01-25-D</B> dichroic mirror placed at 45-degree angle of incidence. The emission spectrum for our construct is generated with Ocean Optics SpectraSuite software.
</P><P><B>Ocean Optics USB-4000 Portable Spectrometer</B></P><P><SPAN class="grey">Experimental setup for infrared emission spectrum measurement.</SPAN></P><P>
In our attempts to optimize the experimental setup, we conducted repeated experiments with the positive control (sample of Tsien’s Lab) to generate the maximum signal intensity.
</P><P>Our optical experimental setup proved to be working well when we managed to optimize our readings to a maximum peak of intensity (counts) of 1500 for a 16-hour cell culture incubated at 37°C (fluoresence emission spectrum attached as below):

This strongly suggests that this optical experiment setup with the Ocean Optics USB-4000 Portable Spectrometer is capable of detecting signals from our cells containing the infrared signal reporter. 
</P><P>
The successfully constructed device: J23119-RBS-IFP-T-J23119-RBS-HO1-T (J23119:B0034:K256008:B0015:J23119:B0034:I15008:B0015) was tested for infrared signal activity with this similar setup. For simplicity, this device will be called 119-IFP-119-HO1 in subsequent text. 
2mL of the overnight culture of 119-IFP-119-HO1 was pipetted into the fluorimetric four-clear-side cuvette. The cuvette was placed in the cuvette holder for detection of infrared signal. A positive control which was the sample from Tsien’s Lab and a negative control which was competent cells (E. coli strain K12) were included. However no fluorescence emission signal was generated from 119-IFP-119-HO1. 
</P><P>
Possibilities are the concentration of the cells might be too low to generate the fluorescence emission peak. The same overnight culture of 20mL of 119-IFP-119-HO1 was centrifuged at 4000rpm for 10 minutes and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 2mL of LB for a 10x concentrated volume of cells. Anticipating a greenish pelleted cells for this device due to the heme-oxygenase 1 that will generate the biliverdin (a green pigment), the pelleted cells of 119-IFP-119-HO1 were compared and contrast by observation with pelleted competent cells (<I>E. coli</I> strain K12) and pelleted GFP-containing cells. Indeed, the pelleted cells of 119-IFP-119-HO1 was greenish in colour!
</P><P><B>Cell Pellet Comparison</B></P><P><SPAN class="grey">119-IFP-119-HO1 was greenish in colour, different from greenish of GFP.</SPAN></P><P>The resuspended 2mL cell culture was pipetted into a fluorimetric four-clear-side cuvette and placed into the cuvette holder.

Detailed results are provided in Parts Chracterization part.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Device_Characterization"> Device Characterization </SPAN></H2><P><B>Temperature Dependence</B></P><P>Temperature dependence of IFP protein by fluorescence emission measurement were conducted. Cell cultures were incubated for 14 hours at 225 rpm at three different temperatures: 25°C, 30°C and 37°C. Centrifugation and resuspension in 2 mL of LB were done to obtain significant signals.

Hence, we characterized the pH dependence of IFP fluorescence. We carried out the experiment in pH 4, 7 and 10. These pH-s are of interest because the normalized fluorescence is stable over the range of pH 5 to 9. The cells were cultured at 37°C and 225 rpm for 14 hours and the cell culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline adjusted to the corresponding pH. Two approaches were carried out. The first approach used whole cell while in the second approach used cell lysate to better expose the IFP to the pH condition. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to the optical experiment setup with Ocean Optics USB4000 Spectrometer as before.
</P><P><B>pH Dependence of Plaque Out! Imaging Device</B></P><P><SPAN class="grey">Whole cell extract does not show significant difference between the three experimental pH values.  This might be due to the cell membrane which limited diffusion of the PBS to the internal cell environment. Subsequently, we sonicated the cells to obtain cell lysate. However, this procedure might have caused the biliverdin to dissociate from the IFP resulting in significantly lower intensity level. </SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Literature_.2F_References"> Literature / References </SPAN></H2><P>Please proceed <A href="/Team:NTU-Singapore/Project/References" title="Team:NTU-Singapore/Project/References"> here</A> to view our full list of references.
