Word to Sponsors
We are currently looking for sponsors to aid the team’s iGEM project for 2009. We will utilize these funds to bolster our research efforts. As a sponsor of the team, our publicity at the iGEM Jamboree and acknowledgement of your organization in all our publicity collaterals will help your organization in enhancing its visibility in the scientific arena. You will also stand to gain publicity benefits of having access to a wide audience at the Jamboree, comprising world-renowned engineers and scientists, and raising your international and local profile. By coming forward and lending your support to the team, you are doing your part in bringing Singapore to the international arena and contributing to the growth of Synthetic Biology in the 21st century.
We welcome any kind of sponsorships; either a monetary contribution or in-kind sponsorship (i.e. laboratory consumables etc.) will go a long way in helping the team. There are three sponsorship tiers, namely:
Gold Sponsor - for contribution equivalent or above $ 5,000;
Silver Sponsor - for contribution equivalent or above $ 2,000; and
Bronze Sponsor - for contribution equivalent or above $ 1,000.
If you are interested in sponsoring us, please contact us at: ntu.igem09@gmail.com ; or alternatively call (Mr) Lim Kuan Chien, the Business Manager of the team at +65 9089 8098 or fax to +65 6794 7553.
