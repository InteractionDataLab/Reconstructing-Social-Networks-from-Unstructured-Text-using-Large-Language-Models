Singapore Profile
Singapore's strategic location.
Just south of the Malay Peninsula, and just north of the Indonesian Riau Islands lies sunny Singapore. One of the few sovereign city-states in the world, Singapore first found its way into the modern history books in 1819, when the British established a trading post on the island.
Since gaining independence in 1965, Singapore has rapidly become one of the most vibrant cities in Asia, with a highly diverse & cosmopolitan population of 4.86 million, comprising of a ethnic Chinese majority, and a significantly large population of Malays, Indians and other races. English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil are the official languages. As such, most citizens are effectively bilingual, fluent in English and their mother tongue.
Economically, Singapore is an modern industrialized nation, and is the 5th wealthiest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita.
