About Us
Brainstorming Ideas
Health & medicine
Create an insulin delivery system which response to low glucose level or time controlled release
Vitamin synthesis?
Hinder carcinogenics
Maslinic acid (olive skin)-tritrepenoid compound
Can we study anti-tumoral and apoptotic effect of this compound?
E coli to interfere in the carcinogenic pathways
Mimic the maslinic effect to the carcinogenic cells?
Surface markers?
 Trap parasites in host cells by disabling the protease
Can we remove the trap parasites?
Terminate parasites?
Genetic modified bacteria that have anticoagulant properties.
Eczema relief
Bacteria to treat gangrene
To eat up dead tissues
Bacteria to deliver growth factors
Collagen producing bacteria
Bacteria that absorbs cholesterol
Constipation pill
Synthesis specific growth factors
Bacteria that produce PDGF
Using bacteria to breakdown blockage in blood vessels
Malaria vaccine
 Forcibly expresses a certain gene and create a vaccine against it
Proof of concept
Cancer treatment - colon cancer(CA marker)
Fusion protein to signal the expression of perforin (e coli as NKC)
Streptococcus vaccine
p-Falciparum gene expression stabilization for malaria
Intestinal vaccine delivery
Bacteria to target the larvae
To separate Tamoxifen (possibly a chiral drug) by uptake the drugs into modified E Coli and bind it to the receptor inside the bacteria.
Biosensor
Biosensor that sense the present of allergen and release drugs to prevent allergenic response
Mimic allergy response-to determine allergen?
 Fingerprint detection
 Can cells response to magnetic fields?
Bird GPS ??
Magnetic field biosensor
 Biosensor to detect cancer
Environmental
E coli to detect toxins in food and flu strain in animals.
Biomask
 For absorption
Create a water purifying system that recognize and trap toxic
to uptake salt and others- sea water purification
Bacteria producing water for the use of photosynthesis so that plants can grow well in dry area
Is it possible to construct water using certain metabolism pathway?
Signalling
Multi-color display according to inputs
to improve signal inputs
DNA methylation as memory storage
suffocate the cells
baccine
To construct guiding E Coli that guide pathogenic bacteria to a region of toxin/UV light.
Application
bacterial barometer
fill up crack
dust repel
microscopic spring-using spirobac
To construct a Sound sensing bacteria
Modeling
modeling the trend of evolution of flu viruses
Bioproduction
Methanol in E-coli
