Our Protocols
Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
(Estimated time: 25 min + 5 min for every part if you use scalpel/tweezers or + 15 min for every part if you use punch tool)
Materials needed :
Pre-warmed at 42°C TE
Desired spot location information
punch tool
ddH20
99% ethanol
0.5 ml tubes
Protocol
Put 10 µL of pre-warmed TE into a 0.5 ml tube.
Cut paper spots using punch tool, following the instructions provided with the IGEM kit.
Put the cut paper into the 0.5 ml tube.
Clean punch tool with water and ethanol every time after cutting a spot; be careful to dry the punch tool.
Incubate at 42°C for 20 min.
Vortex and spin down.
Pipette 4-6 µl of DNA resuspension for transformation
Side note:
Pick a single colony and inoculate broth (again, with the correct antibiotic) and grow for 18 hours.
Use the resulting culture to miniprep the DNA AND make your own glycerol stock
Plasmid resuspension from Well
(Estimated time: 25 min)
Materials Needed
DI water
Protocol
With a pipette tip, punch a hole through the foil cover into the corresponding well to the Biobrick™-standard part that you want. Make sure the plate is oriented properly. It is NOT recommended to remove the foil cover, as it could lead to cross contamination between the wells.
Add 15uL of diH2O (deionized water)
Take 2uL DNA to transform your desired competent cells
Side note:
Pick a single colony and inoculate broth (again, with the correct antibiotic) and grow for 18 hours.
Use the resulting culture to miniprep the DNA AND make your own glycerol stock
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
(estimated time: 3 hours)
Materials needed: Double Digestion mixture composition (total volume: 50 µL)
DNA    1mg (usually 4~5 µL)
Enzyme-1   1 µL
Enzyme-2   1 µL
NEBBuffer-2   5 µL (1/10 of total volume, check double digestion table for which buffer to use)
BSA    0.5 µL (1/10 of buffer volume)
Mili-Q water  37.5 µL
Protocol
Measure plasmid concentration by Nano-drop
Pipette apropraite amount of vector (usually 4~5 µl for 1 µg)
Take out NEBuffer and BSA to thaw (usually stored at -20 deg C), vortex for well mix
Adding the following components sequentially into 200 µL PCR tube, following the order: Mili-Q water → Enzyme Buffer → BSA (optional) → DNA → Enzyme
Pulse spin the tube and incubate at 37 deg C for 2 hours (2.5hrs)
Do MiniElute PCR purification for all the tubes to remove enzymes and buffers
Load the 10 µL plasmid with 2 µL loading dye for gel running
Notes
check 37 deg C incubator is on, take out buffer, BSA, to thaw and vortex before adding, when adding buffer, enzymes, DNA (not BSA), putting the whole pipette tip into the solution, and then pipette up and down. For adding BSA, just push strongly and fast all the way down.
LB - Agar Plate Preparation Protocol
(Estimated time: 3 hours + 1 hour pouring process)
Materials needed
LB broth
Agar
Autoclave bottle
Petri dishes
Protocol
Weigh 25g of LB-Agar powder mix (or 15g LB powder + 10g agar) per liter of media desired. One liter makes 40-50 plates
Select an appropriate bottle and dissolve LB-Agar in autoclaved Mili-Q water. Add a stir bar and use a magnetic stirrer to speed dissolve process
Cover the bottle with aluminum foil, and secure the foil with autoclave tape. The foil should be somewhat loose (to avoid building pressure in the bottle while sterilizing and blowing the foil off).
Load the bottle into the autoclave, and sterilize it
Once the autoclave finishes venting (which can take twice as long as the sterilization proper), Unload the hot bottle using the insulated oven gloves
Allow the media to cool until it can be handled without the oven mits.
Once media is cool, add appropriate amount of ampicilin stock (stock 50mg/ml, final 100ug/ml, To achieve final concentrations, add 2mL of stock per 1L of media), use the magnetic stirrer (added before autoclave) to mix.
Pour directly from the bottle into sterile petri plates. Use a inoculation loop to snuff out bubbles that form during pouring. Bubbles can allow cells to access nutrients without being exposed to the plate's antibiotic, and should be blown out immediately before the gel can set.
Allow the plates to stand right side up until the gel sets. Plates should be stored upside down to keep condensation from falling on the media. Store petri plates in the plastic bags they ship in, in the 4°C fridge.
Transformation
(Estimated time: 3 hours and 30 min + 12-16 hours overnight incubation)
Materials needed
LB agar plates with proper antibiotic added (Ampicilin)
Thawed Invitrogen TOP10 cells (every tube contains 50 µl of cell suspension)

Heat shock: 42°C for 1 min.
Put transformed TOP10 tube on ice for 2mins and then add 200 µl SOC medium into the tube.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C, 225 rpm.
Plate 200 µl of solution on a proper agar plate (with Ampicilin resistence).
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
Inoculation for overnight growth

DNA concentration Measurement using NanoDrop
(Estimated time: 10~20 mins)
Materials needed
DNA suspension in EB
NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
Protocol
Start up software by clicking on shortcut
Chose measurement (Nucleic acid for DNA and RNA samples)
Clean pedestals with tissue with MilliQ water
The software asks for a testmeasurement with MilliQwater: Add 1.8 μl of MilliQ water to front pedestal and click “OK”
Add 1.8 μl of a Blank (DNA: EB) to pedestal and click “Blank”.
Add 1.8 μl of sample, click “Measure”, note results and type in a sample name in the software window
Several different values can be read:
DNA or RNA conc. in ng/microliter at 260 nm
Protein conc. at 230 nm
Quality at 260:280 (should be around 1.9)
Clean pedestals with tissue before measuring next sample
Close software by clicking “Exit” (twice)
Retrieve data by clicking on shortcut to “nanodrop data”
SDS Page for protein

Overnight cell culture
Protocol
Inoculate interested colony in LB medium at 37°C overnight (250 rpm)
Dilute the above cell culture to 100 times in flask with LB (0.5mL in 50mL LB)
Incubate the flask until the culture OD ~= 0.8
Divide the above cell culture into two flask each with ~25mL
One flask is for control while the other one for experiment
Incubate until OD=1.6
Pipette 1mL cell culture from the above two flask and centrifuge at 12000rpm for 10 mins
Re-suspend the cell in 150 µL TE buffer
Pipette 15 µL cell sample into two fresh 1.5mL tubes
Add 15 µL sample buffer into the above two tubes
Let the tubes stands in boiling water for 10 mins
Take the gel out of fridge for it to thaw
Spin down the vapor and Load 15 µL sample into each slot
Gel run at 200V for 30mins
Remove the cover and extract out the gel
Wash and stain for 1~2hrs
Wash and de-stain for overnight
check gel band by densitometer
Notes
Sample buffer lyses the cell and bind to the protein
After staining, the entire gel show blue color, the de-stain procedure is to remove the straining, however, the site where protein resides will remain blue since stain bind to the protein
