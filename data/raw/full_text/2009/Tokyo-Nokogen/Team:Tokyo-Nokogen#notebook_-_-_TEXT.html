Discuss our team project and set goals
Collect and search journals and information  related to our project

★ 08/03/09 to 08/07/09---preparation for expariment
Prepare for experiment (make LB medium,  several antibiotic LB plates and DH5a competent cell)
Transform and do miniprep plasmids contain standard  parts.

★08/10/09 to 08/14/09 ---preparation for experiment
Transform and miniprep standard parts (RBS,  BBa_I15008, BBa_I15009, BBa_S03417, BBa_R0083,
GFP, Terminator, BBa_I714075,  crRBS, BBa_K145001, BBa_I719005, RFP, BBa_K113009 and
BBa_K124003. Search DNA sequence of anitigen43 and find  that there is 6 PstⅠ restriction sites.
★ 08/17/09 to 08/21/09 ---parts construction
[counter group】
Cut plasmids by restriction enzymes and  pick up RBS and taRNA-Term. Ligate these parts and DH5a
was transformed with  sample. Do same things with following parts.
Part 1

This chart suggests that  we pick up part 1 and part 2 materials, ligate them, transform DH5a with them,
inoculate that cell and do miniprep after cultivation.
