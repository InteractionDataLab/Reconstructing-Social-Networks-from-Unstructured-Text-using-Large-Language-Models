Team:Tokyo-Nokogen
From 2009.igem.org
We belong to the Department of Biotechnology at Tokyo University of  Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) in Japan. Our team comprises ten  undergraduate students, four instructors and an advisor. This is the  first time for us to take participate in iGEM. Prof. Sode informed us  about iGEM competition, and we girded up our loins to build  'Tokyo-NokoGen'. All the members have a great deal of interest in  synthetic biology although we don't major in synthetic biology.Trying  to achieve the goal of our project, we would like to realize how  wonderful synthetic biology is. It is attractive for us because  synthetic biology is capable of unrestricted design and construction of  a novel biological system by bottom-up approach starting from almost  nothing, different from "genetic engineering" that is our major. We  think it is essential to unify biotechnology with other research fields  such as system engineering, mathematics and bioinformatics because the  biological system is so complicated. This correlation of different  fields of study is what we aim to do in our department of Biotechnology  in TUAT.We are glad to have a precious experience to learn how to  develop our project. In this year, we will corporate with NYMU-Taipei  at National Yang Ming University in Taiwan. We have already had a first  live meeting and gotten to know each other. From now on, we would like  to compete with each other and construct attractive genetically  engineered machine.With renewed dreams and hope, we have started our  projects !
