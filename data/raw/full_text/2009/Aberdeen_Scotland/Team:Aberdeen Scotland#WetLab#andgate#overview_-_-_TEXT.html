Introduction:
The AND gate module is at the heart of our project.  It was designed so that production of our target protein (in our experiments we used GFP) would only commence in the presence of two imputs, hence being an AND gate (only when imput A AND B are present does 0 become 1).  In terms of biology, this module was composed as in Figure 1, consisting of a pLux-Lac hybrid promoter [1], lambda cI, GFP and a double terminator.
The imput signals are IPTG which will diffuse into the pipe upon a breach, this will remove the LacI protein inhibiting transcription.  The second imput is our luxR activated promoter, this input is triggered upon HSL binding to luxR, this event will occur upon a sufficient quantity of bacteria being in close proximity (see Quorum Sensing )
