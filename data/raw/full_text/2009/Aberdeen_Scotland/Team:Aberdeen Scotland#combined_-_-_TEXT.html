Combined Chemotaxis and Lysis Model
Introduction
Results
A schematic diagram of the model as it works in SimBiology is displayed below:
File:Liam1.GIF
The dashed lines represent an enzymatic reaction, and the arrows represent the direction of chemical reaction. As stated before all mRNA productions must be modelled by an enzymatic production from DNA, and all protein productions must be modelled as enzymatic production from mRNA. This is useful as the repression and activation of gene networks can be modelled by mass action reactions between the unbound and bound form of the DNA or mRNA.
Our SimBiology model can be downloaded on the download page if you want to see how we modelled it exactly, and if you want to see the set of parameters we used. Below is a graph of the system turning on in response to input signals of quorum sensing and IPTG, and below that is one of the system reaching steady state without inputs:
