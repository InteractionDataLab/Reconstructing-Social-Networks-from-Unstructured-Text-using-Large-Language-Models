Wetlab: An Overview
Introduction
In order to work most efficiently we decided to split the wet lab work into 3 separate modules that can be constructed and tested individually, but are at the same time compatible to each other and can be transformed into a single cell upon completion.
The first of these sub-projects is the AND gate of which Calum and Zuzana assumed charge of. In addition to this they also carried out the motility assays.
The second sub-project was the LacI-Latching mechanism as well as the Lysis function. This part of the project was mainly covered by Daniel and Risat.
The third sub-project which was handled by Jennifer and Katriona included the Quorum Sensing in addition to a range of qualitative assays relating to the protein interaction outside of the cell.
