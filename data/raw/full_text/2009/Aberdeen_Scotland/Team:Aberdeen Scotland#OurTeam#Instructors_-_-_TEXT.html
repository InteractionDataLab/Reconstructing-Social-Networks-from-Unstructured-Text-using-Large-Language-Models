Instructors
Prof. Alistair Brown
Field: Candida albicans pathogenomics; molecular mechanisms that underpin the dynamic fungal responses to host niches
PhD at Aberdeen University (1979); postdocs at Brewing Research Foundation and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1979-83); lecturer at Glasgow University (1983-89); moved back to Aberdeen University in 1989, gaining a personal chair in 1998.
Dr. George Coghill
Field: Model-based Systems and Qualitative Reasoning, Systems Biology
Degree in Engineering Science from Aberdeen University followed by 8 year as a Medical Physicist. Decided that Academe looked more interesting so spent 7 years as a Post-doc at Heriot Watt (during which time I actually did a PhD in Intelligent Systems/Electronic Engineering). Became a lecturer at Aberystwyth University in 1997, and returned to Aberdeen in 2002.
Dr. Mamen Romano
Field: Nonlinear dynamics and time series analysis, modelling of biological systems
I studied Physics in Spain and Germany; then I did my PhD at the University of Potsdam (Germany) in 2004, and stayed there for two more years doing a PostDoc. I moved to Aberdeen at the end of 2006 and became Lecturer in 2007.

Dr. Ian Stansfield
Field: Yeast molecular biology, protein synthesis, translational control of gene expression.
PhD at University of Sheffield, UK (1990), followed by six years post-doctoral research, University of Kent. Moved to University of Aberdeen in 1996 as Lecturer.
Dr. Marco Thiel
Field: Applied Mathematics, Dynamical Systems Theory and Mathematical Modelling
PhD at the University of Potsdam (Germany) with focus on nonlinear dynamics; Moved to Aberdeen in 2006; now working at the Institute for Complex Systems and Mathematical Biology at the University of Aberdeen.
