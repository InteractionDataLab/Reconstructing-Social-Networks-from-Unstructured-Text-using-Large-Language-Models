Abstract
Whether you want to stop a leaking ship's hull, or repair a fractured bone, you need a  strong adhesive. Our project aims at  producing a new generation of glue.  In contrast to most glues, our glue is natural, biodegradable, efficient on wet surfaces and is composed of  polysaccharides naturally produced by  the Caulobacter crescentus bacterium. Using BioBrickTM standard biological parts, we  engineered a  synthetic Escherichia coli strain which  synthesizes this adhesive material. To improve our expression system, we plan to use a new plasmid stabilization technique, the StabyTM system. This system stabilizes expression plasmid without using antibiotics, which is of major concern in large-scale production of biological materials.
