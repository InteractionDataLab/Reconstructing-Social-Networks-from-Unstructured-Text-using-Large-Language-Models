Project Introduction
 
 
 
 
Quorum  sensing is a process where cells communicate through the production and  detection of autoinducer molecules. These chemical signals orchestrate and  synchronize bacterial activities, as they allow information to be relayed throughout  cell networks. As a result,  prokaryote cell communities are comparable to a multi-cellular organism.
Quorum  sensing is extremely imperative to the cooperative behaviour of cells as it  allows individual bacteria to alter their activities depending on the  population density of the community.
 
“Bacteria  detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of  these autoinducers and alter gene expression, and therefore behaviour, in  response.”(Waters and Bassler, 2005)
 
John  Conway’s Game of Life, a popular representation of cellular automata, can be  modelled as a demonstration of quorum sensing.  The game involves a network of cells whose ‘on/off’ status is dependent  on the state of their neighbouring cells. As a zero player game, the system  proceeds without further input once initiated. This model can be translated  into a biological system by designing prokaryotic cells that fluoresce in  response to a threshold level of an autoinducer. Addition of the chemical IPTG to  designated cells initiates the system and will cause the production of  autoinducer molecules. When left to its own devices, the cell network will  produce a variety of patterns, showing which cells are currently emitting  fluorescent light.
 
The  Game of Life system is an illustration of the quorum sensing process but a second  model can show a practical application of quorum sensing, demonstrating how it  can induce negative, positive or neutral behaviour in a cellular community.
Rock-Paper-Scissors  has been used as a metaphor to portray 3 rival cells that compete for survival.  Each bacterium produces an auto-inducer that only affects the behaviour of one  opponent cell, hence showing the specificity of quorum sensing.
 
Our proposed Rock Paper Scissors system.
 
Cell-to-cell  interactions are not completely understood, especially within complex cellular  ecosystems such as biofilms; therefore it is our aim to exploit the quorum  sensing process to engineer specific interactions between bacterial species. We  aim to generate complex spatio-temporal patterns to visualise the effects of  quorum sensing and to track the cell interactions within the community. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' will allow  for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.
