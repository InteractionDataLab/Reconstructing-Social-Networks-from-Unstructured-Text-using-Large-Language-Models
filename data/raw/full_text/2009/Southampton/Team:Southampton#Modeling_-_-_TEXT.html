Modelling
 
 
In modelling our cell networks, we found it helpful to  visualize our machines at a higher level of abstraction than the ubiquitous  plasmid map. Flow charts were chosen to efficiently represent the dynamics of  the system, borrowing from the engineering concept of finite state-machines.
 
In our Game of Life system, there is only one ‘machine’ type  and two diffusing molecules, IPTG and LuxI. As this is slightly simpler than  Rock-Paper-Scissors, with its three machine types and molecules, we implemented  the Game of Life model first.
 
A simulator was designed to interpret the flow charts and  model the system to produce spatio-temporal patterns. The simulation  environment is defined by an adjustable square grid, typically 100 x 100 for  our simulations. The environment is divided into several layers, starting with  the cell layer. Each location on the grid can be occupied by a single cell of a  predefined type and state. As the simulation progresses cells can change state  in response to the diffusion of molecules in the layers below them, as defined  by their state transition rules. Below the cell layer reside the molecule  layers, with each molecule occupying its own layer. Each grid location holds a  number representing the total number of molecules present in that space. A  diffusion algorithm runs constantly during simulations, allowing a high  concentration of molecules in one area to diffuse to an area of lower  concentration. As each molecule resides on its own layer they never interact  with each other.
 
 
The simulator is written in Tcl and relies heavily on the NAP  extension for fast array  processing. Simulation durations are defined by the number of times the  diffusion algorithm is run and it typically requires about 2 x 10^5 iterations  for an initial drop of a molecule in the centre of the grid to diffuse to the  edges (for a 100 x 100 grid). On the ageing laboratory P4 it took about 90  minutes to run the simulation described above.
 
After generating several interesting results from the Game  of Life simulation, we looked to modifying the system to simulate our  Rock-Paper-Scissors models. Much of the source code was the same for both  systems leading us to wonder, ‘What if there was a program that could simulate  any system with mechanisms similar to ours?’ The simulator was generalized to  allow it to be used with any system involving the production and diffusion of  chemical products between cellular machines. A user interface was also added to  allow non-programmers to enter their models and run simulations of their own.
 
The results of our simulations can be at the Game of  Life  and Rock-Paper-Scissors pages.
 
The simulator package is available for download from the Open  Access  page. Although it  currently has all of the features required to model our systems and those  similar to them, there is much more that can be done. The program has been  open-sourced and instructions on how to acquire the source can also be found there.
