City of Southampton
 
 
 
 
The city of Southampton is located on the  central south coast of the United Kingdom, approximately 60 miles south-west of  London. With an estimated population of around 230,000, it is the largest city  in the county of Hampshire. Southampton is a major commercial port, being one  of the largest in Europe, handling many large goods vessels, and more notably,  is home to some of the world’s largest cruise vessels. The city’s close union  with the sea has dated back many years, with RMS Titanic setting sail from the  port in 1912.
Within Southampton, major employers include the  University of Southampton, Southampton Solent University, Ford, British  Broadcasting Corportation (BBC), Ordnance Survey and the National Health  Service (NHS). Southampton is affectionately known as the “Home of the Ford  Transit”, Europe’s best-selling light commercial vehicle, with the Transit  production plant sited on the outskirts of the city.
It is thought that settlers have inhabited the  locale of Southampton since the stoneage, when it was known as Porth Hamon.  Following Roman invasion almost two millennia ago, the fortress settlement of  Clausentum was established. Anglo-saxon settlement gave rise to Hampton  (formerly Hamwic and then Hamtun), in the current east side of the city. It was  not until medieval times that the city gained the name of Southampton. One of  the most famous pieces of Southampton’s history that can still be seen today is  the presence of the medieval walls and the Bargate, in the city’s centre,  something that is reflected in the Southampton City Council identity. The  remnants of the city walls are thought to be some of the longest surviving in  the UK. In it’s more recent history, Southampton obtained official city status  in 1964, and became a unitary authority in 1997.
