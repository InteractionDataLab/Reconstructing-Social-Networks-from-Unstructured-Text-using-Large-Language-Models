To iGEM or not to iGEM? On one hand we  have a cohort of students who have been through our first ever Synthetic  Biology elective module, so are keen and fired up to do great things. On the  other there’s the inevitable huge amount of work that will pile on the other  huge amounts of work we all seem to be doing. I know there’s more than 24 hours  in a day, but this would just be ridiculous. On yet another hand is the issue  of funding.   We could get the money but  would it be a good use of it? On a further hand: we would raise the profile of  Synthetic Biology across the University by participating in iGEM. Things that  make you go hmmm. .. So many hands to play.  To iGEM or not to iGEM? A Kali-esque dilemma.

Flipping a coin decided it. The paths  of fifteen people will be forced to cross. The course of their summer will be  decided.  Who knows what rows,  infatuations or personal hells may face them? And the possibility of abject  failure, either personally or as a group, scarring them and shaping their  future life choices. So naughty. Flipping a coin decided it. Simple really.

Eeeny, meeny,…. Who will be on the  first Southampton iGEM team? Bright sparks? Style freaks? Shy geeks? Sharp  wits? Half wits? Bookworms? Sloworms? A “rigorous selection process is needed”.  I think about it. Who will be on the first Southampton iGEM team? Eeeny,  meeny,….

May the Lord have mercy on their souls. The fifteen now are. Eleven proselytes and four pros. A motley fellowship forged  in the quest for mythical plasmid rings. The chosen ones have met several times  amid good cheer and much jollity. Discussions have begun to focus on the  project itself. What are we going to do?  Several brainstorming sessions to focus, refine and hone, coming up over  the next few weeks. The road ahead is treacherous and will be strewn with  dashed expectations. Free enterprise: may the Lord have mercy on their souls.

Logistics, logistics, logistics. A  fellowship of fifteen, made up of four advisors, two undergrads with a little  experience in genetic modification and nine neophytes.  Put the two as joint leaders of the team.  Organise office large enough for whole team as the iGEM base room, then find  lab space. Our labs are full so need a whole new room. Room identified, so now  cunning plots on how to defenestrate its current occupant. Have we enough  equipment? Less than a month to mission start date so massive spending spree to  equip additional lab with day-to-day equipment and consumables for eleven  hungry students. Oh, and not forgetting Human Resources paperwork for all  undergrads, complete with project description and person description forms.  Aaargh!

Don’t adjust your set, normal service will  be resumed shortly. It’s amazing and not a little sad to see how idealism  is dashed on the rocks of pragmatism. Firstly one undergrad team member left  behind due to ill health. “Don’t wait for me. I’ll only slow you down”. Brave  soldier. The brainstorming meetings produced so many ideas for practical  solutions to real problems. The undergraduate team members were united by their  zeal to achieve something that mattered, to work on a project that helps  somebody, somewhere, rather than one that is just scientifically interesting.  The Southampton iGEM2009 team is set to save the world! Don’t adjust your set,  normal service will be resumed shortly. Save the world!  In ten weeks? Frantic meetings of advisors  come up with initial ideas for projects that are in fact deliverable in ten  weeks. The Game of Life and the Gray-Scott projects are born – definitely very  interesting scientifically. Tethered by gravity, pragmatism rules absolute.

Here’s one I prepared earlier. The two  experienced undergrads have just become newby postgrads and have been working  through the reactions that will be used in the project, preparing protocol  sheets and making sure everything is ready to go.  We have a rough time plan for how the project  will develop: two weeks of skills development + six weeks of frantic effort +  two weeks of optimisation = a perfect fully working project that will stun the  iGEM community by its beauty and cleverness. Maybe we should have had a  pre-iGEM project, just in case things don’t quite work out as we expect, so  that we could do the old “Here’s one I prepared earlier” routine…

One day all this will be yours. First  day of the iGEM team. Tomorrow I am out with the other advisors and the two  group leaders on our annual outing. The iGEM neophytes will be starting as we  mean them to go on: on their own. One day all this will be yours. Actually that  day is tomorrow. And remember to switch off the lights when you leave.

I think we chose wisely. I can’t  believe how well the iGEM team are getting on with each other. This generation  is so networked and multi-task enabled that when a group of them get together  they morph into a single organism – not unlike a slime mould, but somewhat less  smelly. The iGEM collective! New age, new style. The banter in the office is  good, morale is strong, as is the sexual tension. I think we chose wisely.

Be afraid of swarms, be very afraid. This  networking thing is unsettling. They work hard and play hard with each other,  but can’t seem to function if taken out of the group. I was in the lab  yesterday preparing some samples for another project and four of the iGEM team  were there to run some DNA gels. They moved like a mini-swarm with the average  distance between in the range 0.65 m - 0.72 m. They swarmed to the fridge,  where a discussion was had on which was the right DNA ladder to use. Then they  swarmed towards a bench in search of a pipette; discussion of which would be  the best one to use started before  conclusions were reached on the DNA ladder.  Then they swarmed to the gel electrophoresis equipment, where a third stream of  debates was started on how, what voltage, who and for how long. Before long gels  were stabbed and subjected to what amounted to capital punishment. Not  surprisingly the results were surprising to the swarm. Idiot village. Be afraid  of swarms, be very afraid.

Shiny ideas lie discarded. The  fellowship has suffered another casualty. It’s now down to eight undergrads,  with one having to be carted to the local hospital. This may be a temporary  absence sorted by quick and dirty surgery. The undergrads appear to have  progressed from the neophyte stage, and to be less prone to swarming, but at  what cost? I wonder about the long term mental health of the two group leaders  who are putting their all into this. After much internal discussion the group  have decided to change the project targets. Game of Life remains, but  Gray-Scott has become Rock-Paper-Scissors, a much better proposition.  Also, much debate about a logo. I produce  several suggestions that are dismissed contemptuously by the iGEM collective.  They’ve come up with E.colYMPICS. This lot can do cheesy in such an effortless  and classy way. Shiny ideas lie discarded like empty wing cases in an insect  graveyard.

Sometimes less is more. Back from a  week in Turkey, at a conference of course. Found a despondent iGEM collective;  ligations are not working. But the collective seems to be licking it’s wounds – literally in the case of one team member. Time for a pep talk to keep up their  spirits, which I deliver while thinking of Churchill, William Wallace and King  Leonidas. They seem even more unhappy now. Come to think of it two of the three  came to a very sticky end. Sometimes less is more.

The end is nigh. Last day of the iGEM  lab experience for the undergraduates; next week they go back to their normal  academic life. So far the project has not been an unqualified success. But  there is still hope with the two postgraduates soldiering on unfettered by  having to lead the group. The end is in sight, the end is nigh.

Desperate times need desperate measures. With time running out we need our ligations to work so that we can submit at  least one new biobrick. I take my place on the front line and go into the lab  to do some transformations.  Another contribution.  One of the transformations works. Desperate times need desperate measures.

Good things come to those who wait. Today  and tomorrow we tie up all lose ends. New biobrick made, sequenced and sent off  to iGEM HQ. Last changes to the team Wiki. In the next couple of weeks the team  will be practicing its presentation and printing the poster. And then its off  to the Jamboree. Except that I won’t be there, other than in spirit. I will be  looking down on the small harbour into which the ‘Demeter’ was guided, “unsteered  save by the hand of a dead man”, musing on how, a bit like iGEM2009 for us,  this marked the beginning of an interesting sequence of events, rather than the  end. The unseen ripple of the pebble. The legacy of our iGEM2009 experience?  A few tips:
iGEM is about the undergraduate experience. Let  them run it and run with it. The temptation for advisors to interfere with the  iGEM collective is very strong, but must be resisted. Strong undergrad leaders  are priceless.
iGEM is not cheap. Is the undergraduate  experience worth it? If it is (and for us it was) then the whole operation  needs to be resourced properly
it is worth putting time and effort planning  ahead the logistics of the whole iGEM experience.
the legacy of the iGEM experience is almost  certainly more important than the experience itself or the outcome of the  project.
But above  all: good things come to those who wait.
