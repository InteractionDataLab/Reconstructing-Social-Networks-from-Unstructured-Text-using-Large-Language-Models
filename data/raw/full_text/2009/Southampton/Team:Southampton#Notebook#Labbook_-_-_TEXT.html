Culture    overnight of transformed parts
B0015-Failed    B0034 –Failed J23119-Failed C0161-Failed R0062 C0170 C0171 R0079
The    main aim of this week was to grow up any bio-bricks that may be required.    Several parts failed and so had to be repeated. There are many reasons for    the failure, one being the use of the wrong cells and transformations    failing.

The    main aim of this week was to get our first ligations to work, however this    wasn’t the case and so after the ligations were repeated and failed again,    troubleshooting began.
Tuesday

Week Beginning: 31st Aug 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
No experiments were done today
(Bank Holiday)
The aim of this week was to continue trying    to get our first ligations to work, this wasn’t successful the digestion was    found not to be complete and so this is thought to be one of the reasons    behind the failed ligations. The next set of Digestions will be done    overnight instead of the usual 2 hours.
Tuesday

DNA Double Digestion: (pTac – B0034)

Method as per 28/08 but both B0034 and pTac    colonies were diluted in 100μl.
Single Digestion of biobricks: single    digestion was performed as it was discovered that one of the enzymes was not    working efficiently.
C0171 C0179 C0012 C0178 C0170 C0062 C0161 E0040    B0034

Week    Beginning: 7th Sept 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
PCR    of Pmal to produce Ptac
Purification    Gel of C0171, C0012, C0170, C0179, E0040, B0034. B0034 was treated with SAP.
C0171,    C0012 and C0170 was ligated to B0034
TSAP    (thermo sensitive alkaline phosphatase) was used on the plasmid to    dephosphorylate the plasmid so it cannot religate. Digestions with PstI were    done for 8 hours and every other digestion was run for 3 hours. Ligations are    now ran overnight at 4C.
Tuesday
Digestion    of Ptac with EcoRI and XbaI and RBS with XbaL and Spel RBS was treated with    SAP
Ligation    of Ptac to RBS
Culture    overnight of biobrick parts C0161, C0178 and C0062 as these were shown to be    dodgy parts.
Wednesday
A    maxiprep was performed on the parts, which were previously cultured    overnight. Digestion of the parts with Pstl to check that the parts were    correct.
Thursday
PCR    of C0161, C0178, C0062 which didn’t work
Friday
PCR    of Gfp-LVA, which didn’t work.
 
Week Beginning: 14th Sept 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
Transformation of C0170, C0012 and pTac to    RBS
PCR of GFP-LVA with different primers and it    worked.
The ligations of Ptac didn’t work with the 3-hour    digestion and TA cloning was inconclusive, due to a lack of resources. Parts,    which were shown to be dodgy, were re-grown and checked for quality control.
Tuesday
Colony PCR of the ligated parts
Culture overnight of C0161, C0178, C0062.
Wednesday
Digestion of Biobricks pLux, STOP and    LacI.followed by an overnight ligation of the parts
TA cloning of Ptac.
Maxiprep of the cultures from previous day.
Thursday
Transformation of the ligated parts
PCR of GFP LVA suffix with different    primers, which was successful again.
Friday
Colony PCR of the ligated parts
PCR of C0161, C0178 that worked.
 
Week    Beginning: 21st Sept 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
Diluted    colony PCR of the C0012-B0015, R0062-C0012.
Overnight    digestion of Ptac.
Ligation    of Gfp-LVA to plasmid.
TA    cloning was performed on Gfp-LVA to check the prefix and the suffix was    digested properly.  Ptac also had a    successful TA cloned vector. This means that the work to check for complete    digestion can begin. The main focus of this week was to finish any wiki work    as this is the last week for the iGEM students.
Tuesday
PCR    of Ptac from Pmal
Overnight    ligation for TA cloning.
Transformation    of previously ligated part.
Wednesday
Digestion    of C0012 and C0179
Gel    extraction was performed, yielding too low concentrations for a ligation to    occur.
Thursday
 
Repeat    of the previous day’s experiment followed by ligation overnight.
Culture    of the Gfp which was TA cloned
Friday
Maxiprep    of the cultured Gfp. This failed as the DNA was sheared.
 
 
Week    Beginning: 28th Sept 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
Culture    of the TA cloned Ptac
Transformation    of C0012-C0179 and Ptac-RBS
The transformations failed from the beginning of  the week and the conclusion of the Gfp after ligation wasn’t reached until the  next week.
Tuesday
The    Ptac and Gfp-LVA which was TA cloned was digested overnight.
Colony    PCR was performed on the ligations and was shown to have failed.
Wednesday
A    gel was run on the Ptac and was shown to have digested improperly.  Gel purification was performed on Gfp-LVA
Thursday
Digestion    of Ptac overnight and further purification of GFP-LVA.
Friday
Ligations    of Ptac and Gfp-LVA with PSB1A3.
 
Week Beginning: 5th    Oct 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
 
Digestion    of Ptac with EcoRI HF and SpeI
Ptac    Gel purification
TSAP    with PSB1A3 ES digests.
Ligation    of GFP-LVA (ES) into PSB1A3
Transformation    of previous Ligation
More    plates made up
 
Finally    there was a successful ligation. The conditions, which seemed to work, were    18 hours at 16°C. Work is now going to be focussed on showing the    functionality of the Ptac.
Tuesday
No    colonies grew on the plates, suspected that the T4 Ligase was improperly    killed.
Wednesday
Ligation    of Ptac and GFP-LVA with PSB1A3
Thursday
Transformations    performed on the previous ligations
Friday
Colonies    observed on plates. Colony PCR performed on both, GFP-LVA discovered not to    work.
Ptac,    all colonies picked were successful
 
Week Beginning: 12th Oct    2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Monday
 
Grew    up Ptac colonies, 3x Minipreps were performed. The yield was very low, so a    culture for a maxiprep was then put on.
Digestion    of RBS, GFP and B0015.
The    focus of this week was to build a construct, which could prove the    functionality of the Ptac part.
Tuesday
Ptac    was Maxiprep’d. The yield again was very low, we think this was due to the    introduction of the insert causing the plasmid to become low copy.
Gel    purification of the previously digested parts.
Wednesday
Single    Digestion of Ptac was performed.
Thursday
After    gel purification of the Ptac, the yield was very low and so a double    digestion of Ptac was performed.
Friday
Gel    purification of Ptac part.
TSAP    of the E0040 vector.
Ligation    of Ptac and E0040.
 
Week Beginning: 17th    Oct 2009
 
Experiments
Conclusion
Saturday
Transformation    of the previously ligated parts.
Double    digestion of the TA cloned Ptac.
The    focus on this week was to continue trying to build a part, which will show functionality,    and to finish off everything ready for the jamboree.
Sunday
Gel    purification of the Ptac followed by ligation to the E0040 vector.
Colonies    were observed, however after colony PCR, the ligation was shown to have    failed.
Monday
Cultures    of a fluorescent protein were grown up with the Ptac inserted.
Tuesday
Fluorescence    studies were conducted on the Ptac cultures.
 Last minute touches to the Wiki, Poster and    presentation.
Wednesday
