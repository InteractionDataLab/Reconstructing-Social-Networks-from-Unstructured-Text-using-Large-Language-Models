Project Projection
 
 
 
 
 
A long term  ambition of our project is to contribute to the understanding of biofilms by  engineering model cell interaction networks.
 
A  biofilm is a thin layer of tightly packed microorganisms that adhere to, solid  surfaces to form colonies. In many cases the colonies are comprised of several  different species of bacteria. The microbes are encapsulated within a  self-produced matrix, EPS, which is made up of DNA, proteins and  polysaccharides.
 
Biofilms  are unique because unlike normal free-floating bacteria, the close cellular  proximity in the biofilm causes the microbes to exhibit cooperative behaviour.  As a result, the microorganism communities are comparable to multi-cellular  organisms.
 
This  behaviour causes biofilms to be very resilient against attack and hence when  biofilms develop within humans or domestic animals they can be resistant to  antibiotic treatments. When left undisturbed, biofilms build up on surfaces and  can become potentially harmful.
 
In  order to develop more effective ways of removing biofilms, scientists need to  discover more about the cooperative behaviour exhibited by the cell  communities.
 
There  are three basic forms of cell interaction that take place in a biofilm matrix:  negative, neutral and positive interaction.
 
In  our project, we have used a rock-paper-scissors (RPS) model to demonstrate a  particular type of interaction network. Our bacteria are engineered to disable  the primary plasmids of the opponent cells and not to kill the cells, hence  this demonstrates an example of neutral cell interaction, which is thought to  be the primary interaction that stabilises biofilms.
 
In  2002, Kerr et al published a paper in Nature that investigated how the local dispersal of cells promotes biodiversity. To  illustrate this theory, they developed a RPS model where the cells destroy one  another whereby exhibiting negative interaction.
 
A continuation  of our iGEM project would be to expand the RPS system to examine how auto-inducers  from neighbouring cells could interact with the core metabolism of cells; an  example of positive cell interaction.
 
Once the  different forms of cell interaction have been modelled and verified in model  systems, scientists will gain a greater insight into biofilm behaviour and  control.
