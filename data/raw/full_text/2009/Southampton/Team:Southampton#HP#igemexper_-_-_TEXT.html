Human Practices
iGEM Experience
 
 
One of the most successful events in terms of communicating  synthetic biology and informing the public is the iGEM competition itself.  Despite its considerable growth many students still enter the competition with  little knowledge of what it entails.
 
Our aim is to create a light hearted video  that takes them through the trial and tribulations of everyday iGEM. This video  will be encouraging for students hoping to take part in iGEM and also hopefully  will lead to more teams joining the competition. As well as encouraging people  to take up the competition it will hopefully prevent some of the pitfalls that  befell our team in our 2009 experience.
