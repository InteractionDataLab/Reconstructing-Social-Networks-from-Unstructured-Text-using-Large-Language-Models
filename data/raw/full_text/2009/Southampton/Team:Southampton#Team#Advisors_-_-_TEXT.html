Prof. George Attard
George came to Southampton as a SERC Advanced Fellow before  records began. He was appointed as Professor in 2001 but nobody bothered to  tell him what in. Since then he’s been trying to find out what he’s supposed to  be world-class in. Apparently, George is our project supervisor. However, he  prefers to spend his time on ‘family holidays’, and deciding on wearing the  best combination of three different suits at the same time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Ali Tavassoli
Ali was appointed as a lecturer in Chemical Biology in 2006  hot from the Benkovic intellectual hot house. Since then he has won many hot  awards, including a Career Establishment Award from Cancer Research UK,  arousing his colleagues’ envy. Every day without fail, Ali likes to don his  favourite silk shorts and go running around the labs, returning to his office  looking hot. In his spare time he *is* Adam Sandler.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Eugen Stulz
Eugen Stulz is the groups’ ice man. He is believed to have  lain deeply frozen in ice high up the Ötzal Alps for more than 5000 years, but  was thawed as a result of global warming and migrated to Southampton, where he  was recognised to be in fact a wild pokémon. There he has been perfecting his  annoying special ability of attaching porphyrins to anything he touches. He is  banned from obtaining, handling or consuming any of the iGEM students’ DNA  until the Jamboree.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dr. Klaus-Peter Zauner
Klaus-Peter Zauner can sometimes be found in the School of  Electronics & Computer Science. It has been reported that he created a  six-legged robot controlled by the photophobic Physarum polycephalum. What has  not been reported is that he too is under Physarum control, a trait he shares  with other microsoft-branded objects. Travelling to exotic places wearing  nothing but a very large SLR can sometimes restore his pre-microsoft settings.
