        Commencing</H4></TD><TD width="70%"><H4>Summary Of The Week</H4></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>20th July 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>‘Brainstorming’
        becomes our key word.
        We scrutinise various ideas before deciding on ‘Game of
        Life’ and ‘Rock Paper Scissors’.
        Numerous hours were spent on the registry of parts finding approved
        Biobrick parts.
        We become absolute pros at filling out COSHH forms. You just have to
        work through the cramp.</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>27th July 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>Work begins on our wiki
        page and logo design.
        We create a very exciting ‘cluster map’ on our
        wiki. One cluster so far: Southampton.
        We finalise our plasmid diagrams and Biobrick parts. 
        The team mugshot was taken.
        We went from lab protocol amateurs to experts within the week.
        The team supervisor abandoned us for 7 days. ‘Family
        holiday’ was the excuse. We soldiered on.</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>3rd August 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>The hard works
        begins…
        DNA Biobricks were transformed, starter cultures made and plasmid
        maxiprep performed.
        Our Southampton iGEM logo is nearly finalised. 
        Cluster map update: 9 different hits including Canada, Turkey, Poland,
        Japan and Netherlands.
        Work commences on the simulations.
        One man down :( . Apparently going to hospital is the new excuse for
        getting out of labs.</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>10th August 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>Man back :) , he just
        could not stay away.
        Note to self:
        1) In the plasmid maxiprep: Turns out it does make a difference if you
        accidently put the white column on top of the blue, instead of the
        other way round…
        2) Adding B0034 to B0015 and centrifuging them together does not, in
        fact, bode well.
        3) The nanodrop only works when the switch is turned to
  ‘on’.
        Exciting times, having been all maxiprepped out, we started a new
        protocol: Digestion. 
        After much deliberation and input from the entire team, our logo is
        finally finished. It was worth the wait. I mean look at it. Genius.
        Cluster map update: 
        UK (i.e. Southampton) – 57
        Rest of world – 30
        Still a bit of room for improvement…</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>17th August 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>We are granted
        permission to start an outreach project …hold tight folks,
        more details coming soon.
        Our team diminishes further - apparently ‘working at
        home’ is the new ‘working…at
        work’.
        Our PCRs FINALLY work. Maybe practise really does make perfect.
        We perform our last ever Maxiprep…sob.
        Don’t panic though, we are moving onto bigger and better
        protocols; Ligation.
        It’s nearly week six, and we have finally mastered the art of
        making and loading a gel. It’s ‘simple’
        they say. Obviously not. 
        An exciting wall chart appears in our office.
        Cluster map update: UK – 92. Really must stop checking the
        cluster map so often…</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>25th August 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>We perfect a pattern:
        Digest…ligate…transform
        Digest…ligate…transform
        Digest…ligate…transform
        Shame none of them worked…
        On the plus side, our simulations are
        looking good!</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>31st August 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>The team begins to feel pretty
        demoralised as the second week of
        ‘digest…ligate…transform…FAIL’
        commences.
        We decide to momentarily focus on building our ‘novel’ biobrick.
        Good news though, our simulations
        specific to RPS/GoL are complete. Now
        to make them applicable to
        anything/everything else!
        Work starts on our synthetic biology
        video…soon to be the most demanded
        on YouTube.
        Our wiki page has been transformed.
        Just you wait for the launch next week.
        Mesmerising.
        We are warned about round two of
        abandonment by team supervisor.
        ‘Climbing’ is the new excuse. Not even
        blaming the family this time!</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>7th September 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>We think we have finally optimised our
        digest…ligate technique. However,
        when we come to transform, we have a
        distinct lack of competent cells. Whose
        authorisation do we need? The project
        supervisor. And where is he? Turkey.
        Splendid.
        Instead, we concentrate on more
        ‘behind the scenes’ such as content for
        our wiki. It’s going well, and we are
        collecting information fast.
        Progress is also being made with
        regard to the video, the script is almost
        complete, and filming is due to start
        early next week. Now, who wants to be
        in it?
        To fill the lack of time spent in the labs,
        we decided to do a ‘fun’ side project, to
        optimize SYBR gold gels. It failed. Yes,
        an experiment with no use other than
        to fill time, failed. Time to go home…</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>14th September 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>The competent cells finally arrive and we are all frantically busy in labs again. Has anything been successful yet? No.
One of our post grad supervisors makes some dodgy minimal media. As in, it was cloudy and brown. ‘It’s okay he said, they will set clear…’
Meanwhile, our other supervisor threw our ligation products out, only to root around the bin and find that they had kept the right ones in the first place… we look up to our supervisors, we really do. Our first iGEM romance becomes apparent. We’re just surprised it’s taken this long to occur!
Our project supervisor returns sporting the most fantastic suit. Just imagine, beige chinos, brown shoes, white shirt, gold tie and black, velvet jacket. Stunning. 

</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>21st September 2009</H3></TD><TD><H3>So, onto the final week, and what do we have to show for our iGEM experience?
We performed TA cloning on our novel biobricks; pTac and GFP. This is good news, as it is the first (and only) successful ligation so far…
We have a final meeting and farewell with a few refreshments…it starts off well as one of our supervisors walks in and immediately says ‘so, we’re celebrating failure now are we?!’ That didn’t hurt at all. Much.
The wiki is nearly completed, the outreach projects have been successful, and the simulations are ready to be uploaded for the world to see. It’s a shame about the lab work, it really is.
Last ever cluster map update: 26 different countries totalling nearly 400 visits…we just won’t mention how many of those were from the UK (ahem….Southampton).
Finally, our project supervisor drops one last bombshell…he’s not joining us in America. 
Guess the excuse this time…
