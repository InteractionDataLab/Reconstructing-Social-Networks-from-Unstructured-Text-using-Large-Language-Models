The University of Southampton was originally  known as the Hartley Institute, named for the benefactor, Henry Robertson  Hartley (1777 – 1850). Funded by a donation upon his death the Institute was  built, and opened on October 15th 1862 by the Prime Minister Lord  Palmerston, as a centre for the city’s elite. In 1883, the institute was  rebranded as Hartley College and subsequently, in 1902, became Hartley  University College, allowing it to award degrees on behalf of the University of  London. Increasing attendance at the university throughout this period  encouraged expansion of the facilities, and in 1914 the college opened at its  current site in Highfield. The 1920’s and 1930’s saw the addition of many of  the signature buildings of the university, including the Hartley Library,  right. In 1952, in the first Royal Charter issued by HM Queen Elizabeth II, the  College attained full University status, allowing it to award its own degrees,  the first of which were awarded on the 4th July 1953.
 
Today, the university is one of the top 20  centres for undergraduate study in the UK, top 15 for research, and provides  higher education to over 24,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students. In  1994, it became a member of the newly formed Russell Group, a collaboration of  British universities aimed at maximizing the research potential of UK  institutions. Research at Southampton brings in over half of the total income  of the university, and is conducted in a wide range of subjects within the core  faculties of Law, Arts and Social Sciences; Engineering, Science and  Mathematics; and Medicine, Health and Life Sciences.
 
The campus at Highfield is home to the majority  of the university, including recent additions such as the new Mountbatten  building, home to the department of Electronics and Computer Science, the  Institute for Life Sciences, which is under construction to replace the former  site at Boldrewood, and the School of Chemistry, in which the 2009 iGEM  Southampton Team is based. Highfield is also home to the majority of the  student facilities, such as the aforementioned Hartley Library, the Student’s  Union, and the Jubilee Sports Centre, built in 2004 to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of the university. Nearby, Avenue campus is home to the school of  Humanities, including the centre for language studies, and there is also a  division of the university in Winchester, the School of Art. The University  also operates the National Oceanography Centre, the leading centre for research  in marine and earth sciences in the UK.
The University of Southampton is ranked 95th  in the Times Higher Education Supplement QS World University Rankings, 2009 (QS  Intelligence Unit, www.topuniversities.com ).
