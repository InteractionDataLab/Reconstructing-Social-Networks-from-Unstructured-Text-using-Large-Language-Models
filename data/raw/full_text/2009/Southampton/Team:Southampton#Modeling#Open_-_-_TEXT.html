Modelling: Open Access
 
 
The simulator we used to model our Game  of Life  and Rock-Paper-Scissors systems has been released so others can use it to simulate any system involving  the production and diffusion of chemical products between cellular machines. A  simple user interface has been added to allow non-programmers to enter their  own models for simulation.
 
 
The simulator package is available for download from the Southampton iGEM  Forge  page. Although it  currently has all of the features required to model our systems and those  similar to them, there is much more that can be done. The program has been  open-sourced and instructions on how to acquire the source can also be found  there.
