Modelling: Game Of Life
 
 
We interpreted the Game of Life plasmid map to produce the  flow chart below which, when simulated, produced the predicted expanding disk  pattern shown in the animation. Note, if the simulation had been left to run  for longer the expanding disk would have continued until it covered the entire  grid.
 
 
 
 
While we were playing with simulation parameters a  particularly interesting pattern appeared, shown below. Unfortunately, to  reproduce the ring effect with bacteria, a hybrid pLux promoter is required so  the plasmid can turn itself off when LuxIR concentrations pass a certain  threshold.
