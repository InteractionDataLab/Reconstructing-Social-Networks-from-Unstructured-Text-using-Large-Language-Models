Life Sciences    Interface (LSI) Forum
The Life Sciences Interface Forum provides a    mechanism to develop a co-ordinated portfolio of research programmes at the    University of Southampton. LSI Forum’s aims are:
To foster    cross-disciplinary dialogue within the University of Southampton
To nurture and    support distinctive and world-leading programmes at the LSI
To link incipient LSI    activities, Schools’ strategic plans and the University’s research and    enterprise strategy
To enhance external    visibility of LSI activities
To promote    entrepreneurial activities at the LSI
iGEM Team Southampton 2009 would like to thank the    Life Sciences Interfaces Forum for providing the funding and initiative to    allow the participation of Team Southampton in iGEM2009.

University of    Southampton
The University of Southampton is one of the top 15    research universities in the UK and has achieved consistently high scores for    its learning and teaching activities. A member of the prestigious Russell    group of UK universities, there are over 25,000 students and over 5,000 staff    split across six campuses.
iGEM Team Southampton 2009 would specifically like    to thank the School of Chemistry and the School of Electronics and Computer    Science for academic and financial support throughout the undertaking of the    iGEM project.
The School of Chemistry is in the top ten of both    the Times and Guardian League Tables for 2010, whilst it is currently rated    number one in the UK by chemistry students in terms of overall satisfaction    relating to their degree course (National Student Survey 2008). The school is    also one of 25 European universities which were recognised as part of the ‘Group of Excellence’ for the quality of their research by the Centre for    Higher Education (CHE) in 2007.
For further information on the School of Chemistry,    please visit www.soton.ac.uk/chemistry
The School of Electronics and Computer Science at    the University of Southampton was the first in the UK, and possibly even the    world. It was established in 1946 as the Department of Electronics,    Telecommunications and Radio Engineering. ECS is the UK’s leading academic    department integrating computer science, electronics and electrical    engineering. October 2008 saw the opening of ECS’ new Mountbatten building,    giving the School of one Europe’s best multidisciplinary cleanroom    facilities.

Semibiotics.org
Semibiotics.org provides a gateway to current    research programmes in Semi-biotic Systems and to associated outreach    resources. Semi-biotic systems are systems that incorporate biologically    derived components/modules – which could range from multi-protein complexes    through DNA constructs to multi-cellular assemblies – and integrate them with    synthetic components (e.g. microfabricated systems) to produce hybrid    devices.
iGEM Team Southampton 2009 would like to thank Semibiotics.org    for provision of an online interface for iGEM Team Southampton members to    interact and collaborate during their research.
