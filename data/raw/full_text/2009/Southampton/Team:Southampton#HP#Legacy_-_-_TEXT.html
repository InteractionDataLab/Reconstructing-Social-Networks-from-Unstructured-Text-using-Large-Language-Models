Our Legacy
 
 
We don’t want our project to just end with the  Jamboree; our hope is that the project can be extended beyond what we have  already achieved this summer for the enjoyment of future generations. We feel  that the public awareness and understanding is vital for the continuation of  synthetic biology research.
 
In  order for this to happen the following must be achieved:
We have created a video, which will educate future teams of ‘iGEMers’ on what the experience entails.
The education of MPs is also important, as they are involved in the legislation  of synthetic biology. An evening has been planned with the aim of answering any  queries and giving them the chance to speak to scientists working at the  forefront of synthetic biology research.
The outreach event that was run in September was so successful that the  materials will be used to run more throughout the year so that the education of  people at a young age can continue.
A simulation programme has been created, which can be accessed by anyone  and adapted to model diffusion within bacterial systems.
