Acknowledgements
 
 
 
Team  Southampton would like to thank and recognise the following people at the  University of Southampton, for their roles in the iGEM2009 Southampton project:
 
Advisors
Prof. George Attard for arranging and coordinating    the iGEM Southampton project, and for directing the team in their hour(s) of    need (whilst always remaining cool, calm and collected) – maybe this has some    correlation to his mysterious absence at the iGEM jamboree?
 
 
Drs Ali Tavassoli, Eugen Stulz and Klaus-Peter    Zauner for supporting the iGEM project, practically and computationally, and    for unwittingly getting tied into accompanying 8 undergraduate and 2 new    postgraduate students to the iGEM jamboree…
 
Postgraduate Students
Rich and Steph for spending the first couple of    months of their postgraduate degrees supervising 6 undergraduate chemists and    2 undergraduate electronics and computer scientists… organising endless    meetings, sorting piles of paperwork, finding team flights and transport, and    spending long days and nights in the lab… whilst maintaining enough time to    still check facebook!
 
 
Wetlab
All the iGEM team for participating in wetlab work,    no matter how small. However, special thanks goes to the dedicated wetlab    team consisting of Rich, Steph, Danie, Jon, Tom and Claire.
 
Karin  Nordgren, from the Tavassoli research group, School of Chemistry, for  demonstrating some of the synthetic biology methods used.
 
Modelling
Paul and Karolina for tirelessly working on    simulations, much to the bewilderment of the chemists…
Dr Klaus-Peter Zauner, from the School of    Electronics and Computer Science, for offering dedicated support to Paul and    Karolina during the development of the team models. 
 
 
Outreach
Charles and Jo for coordinating the outreach    elements of our project including directing and producing our iGEM experience    video; special thanks to Charles for the schools and politicians outreach and    to Jo for overseeing and directing the team presentation, poster, and wiki    scientific content.
 
Dr David Read, from the School of Chemistry, for    assistance and guidance with the schools element of our outreach.
 
Lee Mulholland, from the School of Chemistry, for    audio provision in the Team Southampton iGEM experience video.
 
 
Wiki
Jon for design, implementation and management of the    Team Southampton iGEM wiki (and for persevering with the masses of emails    received suggesting changes and additions)!
 
 
Claire for the lighthearted notebook and advisor    profiles, bringing a smile to the iGEM office at the end of each week!
 
Jo, Jon, Rich and Steph for the freely-available    protocol downloads.
 
Professor George Attard for the advisor blog (which    was kept under wraps until the wiki submission deadline…)
 
The rest of the iGEM team for additional wiki    content creation and supply.
