Week         Commencing
Summary Of The Week
20th July 2009
‘Brainstorming’ becomes our key word.
We scrutinise various ideas before deciding on ‘Game of         Life’ and ‘Rock Paper Scissors’.
Numerous hours were spent on the registry of parts finding approved         Biobrick parts.
We become absolute pros at filling out COSHH forms. You just have to         work through the cramp.
27th July 2009
Work begins on our wiki         page and logo design.
We create a very exciting ‘cluster map’ on our         wiki. One cluster so far: Southampton.
We finalise our plasmid diagrams and Biobrick parts.
The team mugshot was taken.
We went from lab protocol amateurs to experts within the week.
The team supervisor abandoned us for 7 days. ‘Family         holiday’ was the excuse. We soldiered on.
3rd August 2009
The hard works         begins…
DNA Biobricks were transformed, starter cultures made and plasmid         maxiprep performed.
Our Southampton iGEM logo is nearly finalised. 
Cluster map update: 9 different hits including Canada, Turkey, Poland,         Japan and Netherlands.
Work commences on the simulations.
One man down :( . Apparently going to hospital is the new excuse for         getting out of labs.
10th August 2009
Man back :) , he just         could not stay away.
Note to self:
1) In the plasmid maxiprep: Turns out it does make a difference if you         accidently put the white column on top of the blue, instead of the         other way round…
2) Adding B0034 to B0015 and centrifuging them together does not, in         fact, bode well.
3) The nanodrop only works when the switch is turned to ‘on’.
Exciting times, having been all maxiprepped out, we started a new         protocol: Digestion.
After much deliberation and input from the entire team, our logo is         finally finished. It was worth the wait. I mean look at it. Genius.
Cluster map update:
UK (i.e. Southampton) – 57
Rest of world – 30
Still a bit of room for improvement…
17th August 2009
We are granted         permission to start an outreach project …hold tight folks,         more details coming soon.
Our team diminishes further - apparently ‘working at         home’ is the new ‘working…at         work’.
Our PCRs FINALLY work. Maybe practise really does make perfect.
We perform our last ever Maxiprep…sob.
Don’t panic though, we are moving onto bigger and better         protocols; Ligation.
It’s nearly week six, and we have finally mastered the art of         making and loading a gel. It’s ‘simple’ they say. Obviously not.
An exciting wall chart appears in our office.
Cluster map update: UK – 92. Really must stop checking the         cluster map so often…
25th August 2009
We perfect a pattern:
Digest…ligate…transform
Digest…ligate…transform
Digest…ligate…transform
Shame none of them worked… On the plus side, our simulations are         looking good!
31st August 2009
The team begins to feel pretty         demoralised as the second week of ‘digest…ligate…transform…FAIL’ commences.         We decide to momentarily focus on building our ‘novel’ biobrick.         Good news though, our simulations         specific to RPS/GoL are complete. Now         to make them applicable to         anything/everything else!         Work starts on our synthetic biology         video…soon to be the most demanded         on YouTube.         Our wiki page has been transformed.         Just you wait for the launch next week.         Mesmerising.         We are warned about round two of         abandonment by team supervisor. ‘Climbing’ is the new excuse. Not even         blaming the family this time!
7th September 2009
We think we have finally optimised our         digest…ligate technique. However,         when we come to transform, we have a         distinct lack of competent cells. Whose         authorisation do we need? The project         supervisor. And where is he? Turkey.         Splendid.         Instead, we concentrate on more ‘behind the scenes’ such as content for         our wiki. It’s going well, and we are         collecting information fast.         Progress is also being made with         regard to the video, the script is almost         complete, and filming is due to start         early next week. Now, who wants to be         in it?         To fill the lack of time spent in the labs,         we decided to do a ‘fun’ side project, to         optimize SYBR gold gels. It failed. Yes,         an experiment with no use other than         to fill time, failed. Time to go home…
14th September 2009
The competent cells finally arrive and we are all frantically busy in labs again. Has anything been successful yet? No. One of our post grad supervisors makes some dodgy minimal media. As in, it was cloudy and brown. ‘It’s okay he said, they will set clear…’ Meanwhile, our other supervisor threw our ligation products out, only to root around the bin and find that they had kept the right ones in the first place… we look up to our supervisors, we really do. Our first iGEM romance becomes apparent. We’re just surprised it’s taken this long to occur! Our project supervisor returns sporting the most fantastic suit. Just imagine, beige chinos, brown shoes, white shirt, gold tie and black, velvet jacket. Stunning.
21st September 2009
So, onto the final week, and what do we have to show for our iGEM experience? We performed TA cloning on our novel biobricks; pTac and GFP. This is good news, as it is the first (and only) successful ligation so far… We have a final meeting and farewell with a few refreshments…it starts off well as one of our supervisors walks in and immediately says ‘so, we’re celebrating failure now are we?!’ That didn’t hurt at all. Much. The wiki is nearly completed, the outreach projects have been successful, and the simulations are ready to be uploaded for the world to see. It’s a shame about the lab work, it really is. Last ever cluster map update: 26 different countries totalling nearly 400 visits…we just won’t mention how many of those were from the UK (ahem….Southampton). Finally, our project supervisor drops one last bombshell…he’s not joining us in America.  Guess the excuse this time…
