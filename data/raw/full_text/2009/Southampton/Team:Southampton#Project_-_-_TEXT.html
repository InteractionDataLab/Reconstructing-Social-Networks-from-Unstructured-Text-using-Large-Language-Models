Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a         well-known two-person hand game whereby the players seek to produce a         gesture that will defeat that of their         opponent. By coordinating the promoters and operators of three         different bacterial cells, we have designed a system where each         bacterium can disable the primary plasmid of specific opponent cells,         whilst simultaneously enduring the attacks of their rival cells. Our         aim is to have no bias within the system so that the end result is not         predetermined.

Conway’s Game       of Life
John Conway’s       Game of Life is a popular representation of cellular automata. As a       zero player game, it proceeds without further input once initiated. We       intend to utilize the Game’s basic rules to develop a system       on two separate plasmids that fluoresces in an imitation of the Game. Thereby we aim to initiate and thus control the creation of patterns       produced by the oscillating bacteria.
