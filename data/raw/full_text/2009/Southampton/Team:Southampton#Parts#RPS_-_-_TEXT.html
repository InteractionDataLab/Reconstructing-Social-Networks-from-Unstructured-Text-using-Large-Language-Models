Length
K180000
Regulatory
Hybrid    promoter (trp & lac regulated – tac pR)
A functional, hybrid promoter, derived from the trp and    lac promoters, regulated by trp and lac. tac pR has a stronger binding    affinity than either of its parent promoters.
Yes
1447
K180002
Composite
tac pR    testing plasmid (GFP)
Ptac promoter testing plasmid – green fluorescent    protein is produced if IPTG successfully induces the promoter.
Yes
2330
K180010
Composite
Rock-paper-scissors – Rock primary plasmid
Primary plasmid for rock part of rock-paper-scissors    game. Must be used in conjunction with part K180013 .
Yes
3888
K180013
Composite
Rock-paper-scissors – Rock secondary plasmid
[rhl pR,    LacI generator]
Secondary plasmid for rock part of rock-paper-scissors    game. Must be used in conjunction with part K180010 .
Yes

K180014
Composite
Rock-paper-scissors – Paper primary plasmid
Primary plasmid for paper part of rock-paper-scissors    game. Must be used in conjunction with K180016 .
Yes
3952
K180016
Composite
Rock-paper-scissors – Paper secondary plasmid
[lux pR,    LacI generator]

979
K180008
Coding
mCherry    (rights owned by Clontech)
mCherry fluorescent protein – a derivative of the DsRed    fluorescent protein with a short maturation time but lower relative    brightness.
 
708
K180009
Coding
mBanana    (rights owned by Clontech)
mBanana fluorescent protein – a derivative of the DsRed    fluorescent protein with a longer maturation time and lower relative    brightness than mCherry .
