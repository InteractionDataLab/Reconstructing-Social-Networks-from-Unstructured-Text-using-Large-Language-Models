Length
K180000
Regulatory
Hybrid    promoter (trp & lac regulated – tac pR)
A functional, hybrid promoter, derived from the trp and    lac promoters, regulated by trp and lac. tac pR has a stronger binding    affinity than either of its parent promoters.
Yes
1447
K180001
Coding
GFP-LVA fluorescent protein
GFPmut3b (green fluorescent protein) with an LVA    degradation tag for shortened fluorescence compared to part E0040 .
Yes
754
K180002
Composite
tac pR    testing plasmid (GFP)
Ptac promoter testing plasmid – green fluorescent    protein is produced if IPTG successfully induces the promoter.
Yes
2330
K180004
Composite
Game of    Life – Primary Plasmid
Primary plasmid for Game of Life. Must be used in    conjunction with part K180007 .
Yes
3138
K180007
Composite
Game of    Life – Secondary Plasmid
[tac pR,    LuxI generator]
Secondary plasmid for Game of Life; generates LuxI    under tac pR regulation. Must be used in conjunction with K180004 .
Yes
2195
 
 
 
 
 
K180003
Composite
tac pR    testing plasmid (GFP) – basic
Basic version of K180002 ; no RBS or stop    BioBrick parts. Allows to see the efficiency of GFP production with no RBS    preceding the GFP sequence.
 
2173
K180005
Composite
Game of    Life – Primary plasmid (part 1)
[LuxR    generator]
Part of the Game of Life primary plasmid;    constitutively produces LuxR.
 
979
K180006
Composite
Game of    Life – Primary plasmid (part 2)
[lux pR,    GFP and LacI generator]
Part of the Game of Life primary plasmid; generates GFP    and LacI under lux pR regulation.
