Modelling: Rock Paper Scissors
 
 
Our bacterial interpretation of Rock-Paper-Scissors was to  use three types of cell and have their interactions governed by the rules of  the game. At the start of a simulation the cells are randomly distributed  across the medium and will be expressing their particular fluorescent proteins.  Each cell continuously produces quorum molecules to attempt to inhibit their  rival cell’s fluorescence proteins. Due to the initial random distribution of  the cells, areas with a higher concentration of one type of cell will arise. This  cell type will dominate the area, causing them to remain ‘alive’ for longer.
 
As  the results below show, patches with cells of a single type rapidly appear.  Scissors-type cells disappear first as they were not lucky enough to form large  enough patches to compete with the other participants. It is also possible for  no cells to be left ‘alive’ at the end of a game as messenger molecules  continue to diffuse long after a cell has succumbed to its opposing molecule.
