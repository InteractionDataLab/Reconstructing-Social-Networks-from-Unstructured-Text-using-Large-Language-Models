On the  other there’s the inevitable huge amount of work that will pile on the other  huge amounts of work we all seem to be doing. I know there’s more than 24 hours  in a day, but this would just be ridiculous. On yet another hand is the issue  of funding.   We could get the money but  would it be a good use of it? On a further hand: we would raise the profile of  Synthetic Biology across the University by participating in iGEM. Things that  make you go hmmm. .. So many hands to play.  To iGEM or not to iGEM?

Less than a month to mission start date so massive spending spree to  equip additional lab with day-to-day equipment and consumables for eleven  hungry students.

Firstly one undergrad team member left  behind due to ill health. “Don’t wait for me. I’ll only slow you down”. Brave  soldier. The brainstorming meetings produced so many ideas for practical  solutions to real problems. The undergraduate team members were united by their  zeal to achieve something that mattered, to work on a project that helps  somebody, somewhere, rather than one that is just scientifically interesting.  The Southampton iGEM2009 team is set to save the world! Don’t adjust your set,  normal service will be resumed shortly. Save the world!  In ten weeks? Frantic meetings of advisors  come up with initial ideas for projects that are in fact deliverable in ten  weeks. The Game of Life and the Gray-Scott projects are born – definitely very  interesting scientifically. Tethered by gravity, pragmatism rules absolute. </H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H4><STRONG>9 July 2009</STRONG></H4></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H3><STRONG>Here’s one I prepared earlier.</STRONG> The two  experienced undergrads have just become newby postgrads and have been working  through the reactions that will be used in the project, preparing protocol  sheets and making sure everything is ready to go.  We have a rough time plan for how the project  will develop: two weeks of skills development + six weeks of frantic effort +  two weeks of optimisation = a perfect fully working project that will stun the  iGEM community by its beauty and cleverness. Maybe we should have had a  pre-iGEM project, just in case things don’t quite work out as we expect, so  that we could do the old “Here’s one I prepared earlier” routine…</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H4><STRONG>13 July 2009</STRONG></H4></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H3><STRONG>One day all this will be yours.</STRONG> First  day of the iGEM team.

This generation  is so networked and multi-task enabled that when a group of them get together  they morph into a single organism – not unlike a slime mould, but somewhat less  smelly. The iGEM collective! New age, new style. The banter in the office is  good, morale is strong, as is the sexual tension. I think we chose wisely. </H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H4><STRONG>4 August 2009</STRONG></H4></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H3><STRONG>Be afraid of swarms, be very afraid.</STRONG> This  networking thing is unsettling. They work hard and play hard with each other,  but can’t seem to function if taken out of the group. I was in the lab  yesterday preparing some samples for another project and four of the iGEM team  were there to run some DNA gels. They moved like a mini-swarm with the average  distance between in the range 0.65 m - 0.72 m. They swarmed to the fridge,  where a discussion was had on which was the right DNA ladder to use. Then they  swarmed towards a bench in search of a pipette; discussion of which would be  the best one to use started before  conclusions were reached on the DNA ladder.  Then they swarmed to the gel electrophoresis equipment, where a third stream of  debates was started on how, what voltage, who and for how long. Before long gels  were stabbed and subjected to what amounted to capital punishment. Not  surprisingly the results were surprising to the swarm. Idiot village. Be afraid  of swarms, be very afraid.</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H4><STRONG>24 August 2009 </STRONG></H4></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H3><STRONG>Shiny ideas lie discarded.</STRONG> The  fellowship has suffered another casualty. It’s now down to eight undergrads,  with one having to be carted to the local hospital. This may be a temporary  absence sorted by quick and dirty surgery. The undergrads appear to have  progressed from the neophyte stage, and to be less prone to swarming, but at  what cost? I wonder about the long term mental health of the two group leaders  who are putting their all into this. After much internal discussion the group  have decided to change the project targets. Game of Life remains, but  Gray-Scott has become Rock-Paper-Scissors, a much better proposition.  Also, much debate about a logo. I produce  several suggestions that are dismissed contemptuously by the iGEM collective.  They’ve come up with E.colYMPICS. This lot can do cheesy in such an effortless  and classy way. Shiny ideas lie discarded like empty wing cases in an insect  graveyard.</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H4><STRONG>15 September 2009 </STRONG></H4></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" bgcolor="#5D5D5D"><H3><STRONG>Sometimes less is more.</STRONG> Back from a  week in Turkey, at a conference of course.
