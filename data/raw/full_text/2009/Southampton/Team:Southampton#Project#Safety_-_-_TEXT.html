Team Southampton Safety Assessment
iGEM  2009 Team:Southampton answers the safety considerations issued by iGEM HQ.
Would  any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher  safety,
public  safety, or
environmental  safety?
Team:Southampton has fully considered the  safety implications of both the wetlab and outreach legacy components of their  project, submitting detailed risk assessments and genetically modified organism  (GMO) project application forms to the University of Southampton biological  safety officer. All aspects of the project have been fully approved by the  university biological safety officer, and as such, Team:Southampton are confident  that no element of their project would raise safety issues relevant to  researchers, the public, or the environment.
 
Is there  a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The University of Southampton has a health and safety  office with dedicated biological safety officer, and there is a Genetic  Modification and Biosafety Committee that regularly meets to review university  projects and project applications.
 
What  does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The University of Southampton’s biological  safety officer agreed with the project GMO form submissions, deeming the  Team:Southampton project as Activity Class 1, and as such, was happy for work  to commence, without the need to inform the UK Health and Safety Executive  (HSE). The University of Southampton Genetically Modified and Biosafety Committee  reviewed both the wetlab and outreach legacy GMO forms, approving both  applications under Activity Class 1.
 
Do any  of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes,  did you document these issues in the Registry?
None of the new BioBrick parts made by  Team:Southampton for iGEM 2009 raised any safety issues, and as such, no safety  issues have been documented in the Registry.
