Project Achievements
.
 
We have submitted documentation for 20    registry parts for our two subprojects – Game of Life and Rock-paper-scissors .
 
A new biobrick part of our own construction, Ptac , has been sequenced,    submitted and documented on the registry.
 
The safety    considerations of our project were thoroughly investigated with the    completion of two GMO (genetically modified organism) forms and accompanying    risk assessments.
 
We have participated in an ethics    questionnaire for the Valencia team and have received a Valencia gold medal    for 100% team participation.
 
 
Modelling of our cell networks for both the Game of Life and Rock Paper Scissors subprojects.
A simulation program has been produced that can be used to model any bacterial diffusion system    and this has been made accessible to anyone.
 
We have left an outreach legacy ,    which has become integrated into the School of Chemistry outreach programme    at the University of Southampton.
 
A video, showing our iGEM2009 experience ,    has been produced and is freely available online for all to view.
 
Awareness has been raised in the field of    synthetic biology through the outreach project with secondary school students (age 11-16), and through interviews and    a synthetic biology    briefing with MPs (Ministers of Parliament) in our constituencies.
