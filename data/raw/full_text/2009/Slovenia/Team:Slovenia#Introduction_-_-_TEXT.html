Introduction
Nanomaterials and their design technology represent an important area of modern sciences. Designing the molecular properties at the nanoscale provides material with new properties. Their production is continuously being in the focus of research since these materials may find extensive range of applications in medicine, diagnostics, nanoelectronics, computing, environmental monitoring and many other fields (Lu et al., 2007). Most of nanomaterials under current investigation are prepared from inorganic or organic compounds. Biological systems however provide the possibility to control the assembly of materials at the nanoscale using DNA as the blueprint for almost any desired structure.
