Discussion
Polypeptides represent the major building material in nature in all cells, forming both molecular machines (such as enzymes, ribosomes etc.) as well as the structural material, responsible for the formation of biological scaffold. In comparison to the recent successes of engineering DNA for the design of versatile shapes we have been up to now much less successful in shaping the designed nanoassemblies based on polypeptides, despite the huge advantages of using the polypeptides because of their versatility.
We demonstrated that synthetic designed polypeptides based on nanoBrick modules deposited into the Registry can be used to build structures, whose dimensions, geometry and functional properties are regulated at the nanoscale and can produce the types of designed assemblies that are beyond those existing in nature.
