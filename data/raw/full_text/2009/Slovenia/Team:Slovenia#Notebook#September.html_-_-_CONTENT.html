Several colonies containing vectors with inserts LL37_ELST_GCN_ELST were inoculated for miniprep. One colony with backligation was also inoculated for miniprep.

Ligation of constructs VASP and Vero5 into vector with His-tag at the N-term. was set.

Vector containing APH_BCR was isolated from mini-preps. Vector was then cut to obtain individual constructs APH and BCR, which were later isolated from gel. Construct mNGF cut with NgoMIV and SpeI was also isolated from gel. APH and BCR were then cut with NgoMIV and SpeI  and purified. APH, BCR and mNGF were ligated into vector with His-tag on N-term. of the construct. DH5a cells were transformed with mentioned ligations and vector containing APHE_NZ_CZ.

Manual isolation and control restriction of Vector with His-tag on N-term. containing LL37_ELST_GCN_ELST were performed to find out which colony contains vector with appropriate construct. Vector from this colony was than isolated using GeneJet Kit. 

Vectors with His-tag on N-term. containing VASP and Vero5 were transformed into DH5a cells. Vector with His-tag on N-term. containing KSI-DP_LL27_ELST_GCN_ELST was transformed into BL21 cells.

Several clones of APH, BCR and mNGF in vector with His-tag on N-term. of the construct were isolated from mini-preps and control restriction was made. Vector with APH was then cut for front vector and front insert and mNGF was cut as front vector.

APH, BCR and mNGF in vector with His-teg on N-term. were isolated from mini-preps. Vector with APH was then cut for front vector and front insert and vector containing mNGF was cut as front vector.
Vectors containing constructs ELST, ELST-ELST and LL37_ELST_GCN_ELST were cut as front inserts. All cut vestors and inserts were then isolated from gel. Later, constructs ELST-mNGF, ELST-ELST-mNGF, LL37_ELST_GCN_ELST-mNGF, RADA-mNGF,  p53-APH, APH-p53, foldon-APH and APH-P2 were ligated.

17ml of AEA was unfrozen (solution looked clear). Concentration was measured (c=0,05mg/ml) and the sample was concentrated to 0,13 and 0,16 mg/ml. The last was dialysed overnight in 20mM HEPES.

Method can be also used only to show relative difference and not absolute particle dimensions.

Vectors with His-tag on N-term. containing VASP and Vero5 were isolated. Control restriction confirmed the presence of inserts of appropriate lenght. 

Vectors containing EWAND and TetShack were once again isolated.

Vector containing ELST-ELST-ELST was isolated from mini-prep and cut as front insert. There were no visible fragments (front insert) on gel, so restriction will have to be repeated.

APHE, NZ and CZ fragments cut with NgoMIV and SpeI were purified and ligated in vector with His-tag on N-term. DH5a cells were transformed with these ligations.

In the morning several clones of bacteria containing vectors with RADA-mNGF and LL37-ELST-GCN-ELST-mNGF were inoculated for miniprep. Vectors were later isolated from mini-preps and control restriction was made. One flask was then inoculated with bacteria containing vector with RADA-mNGF construct.
