Preliminary project description
Self-assembly is one of the important properties of biological systems.  Application of this principle along with the ability to genetically encode  the modular building blocks could revolutionize manufacturing, particularly  since the self-assembled structures in nature span from the nano- to the  macroscopic scale.
We plan to investigate the feasibility and potentials of BioBricks principle  to prepare structural elements that will self-assemble into the defined  structures that could be used for different applications, from materials  sciences to health.
