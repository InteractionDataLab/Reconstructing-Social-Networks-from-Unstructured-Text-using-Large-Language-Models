Home The Team The Project Parts Submitted to the Registry Modeling Notebook Safety
PLEASE NOTE: We have encountered a few uncontrollable circumstances with respect to our part's production. There has been a short delay in its shipment to us. We will send our part's DNA to the Registry by the end of the week. Sorry, and thanks for understanding!
This year, our submitted part (BBa_K217000) is a mammalian construct that constitutively produces the tat-GFP fusion protein (for details, see the Project Page ).  The promoter of the part is a constitutive CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter, so any mammalian cell with this plasmid will constantly produce tat-GFP.  The tat-GFP will then diffuse out of the cell (due to tat's membrane-crossing characteristics).  In essence, the cell will shoot out little green "bullets".
Because tat has infectious properties (it can cross cellular membranes with ease), tat-GFP automatically causes this part to be at a Biosafety Level 2, and so should be handled with care.  For more details see the Safety Page .
