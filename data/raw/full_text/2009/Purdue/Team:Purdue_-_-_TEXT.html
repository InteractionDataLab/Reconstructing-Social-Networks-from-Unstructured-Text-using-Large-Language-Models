Welcome
We are the Purdue University Team. This is our fourth year to participate in the iGEM competition. BOILER UP!
For the iGEM 2009 competition we have decided to focus on cancer and are taking a "seek and destroy" approach.  See the project page for more details!!
Here is a video to explain our project: YouTube Video Explanation
This year we have also created a website about Synthetic Biology.  Its purpose is to teach the everyday person what synthetic biology is and some of its ongoing research projects. Check it out!
PLEASE NOTE: We have encountered a few uncontrollable circumstances with respect to our part's production.  There has been a short delay in its shipment to us.  We will send our part's DNA to the Registry by the end of the week.  Sorry, and thanks for understanding!
What the Purdue iGEM Team would look like if we were making a Beatles album...
