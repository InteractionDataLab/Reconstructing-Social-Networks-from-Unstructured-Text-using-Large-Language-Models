Brown iGEM 2009
WebEx Conference Call
May 31, 2009 8:00 PM
Attendees: Will, Eli, Indu, Michael
8:00: Will introduces new idea to deal with localization problem using S. aureus. See google group for details.
8:12: We are going to send the email out to the professors. Ask Adrian for the password for igem@brown.edu so we can also check up on which professors are coming to the conference on June 12.
8:19: Indu could not get a hold of Harvard but will try again tomorrow. Indu will check issues with patents.
8:37: For Safe Cell, we would like to come up with another unique killing mechanism (instead of ccdb) that we can call our own in the project. Possibilities: interrupt cell cycle / fission
8:43: Eli mentions something in the media that facilitates transport of the repressor
8:47: We should ask some other people about the repressor.
8:49: For next meeting: we need Safe Cell repressor candidates, a 3rd novel killing mechanism, details from Steph about S. aureus.
8:53: We should look into gram positive protein secretion. Look up natural levels of staph in the nose.
9:00: Next Meeting: Wed June 3. 8 AM PST. If your trial is expired before then just make a new account with different info.
