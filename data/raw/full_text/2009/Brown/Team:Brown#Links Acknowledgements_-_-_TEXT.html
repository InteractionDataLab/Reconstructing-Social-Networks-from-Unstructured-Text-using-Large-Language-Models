We would like to thank the following individuals without whom this project would not have been made possible:
Dr. Gary Wessel, for his invaluable advice, unremitting patience, continuous encouragement and most of all, tremendous enthusiasm for our project.
Graduate students Adrian Reich, iGEM Adviser, and Diana Donovan, for their continuous guidance and experimental support throughout the project.
John Szymanski, iGEM alum, for his original competent cells protocol and generous assistance in the lab.
Adella Francis, for her consistent and generous administrative assistance for Brown iGEM teams past and present.
John Cumbers, Founder and hardcore supporter of Brown iGEM Teams.
The PRIMO Lab, for their generous assistance in research protocols and laboratory facility use.
The Barnea Lab, for the use of their laboratory facilities.
The Faculty Panel, for its invaluable support and advice.
The Brown UTRA Program, for undergraduate summer research funding at Brown University.
Brown University Departments of Biology and Medicine, Engineering, Computational Biology, Molecular, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry.
Neil Parikh, Kate Jacobs, Rima Shah, John Szymanski and Aaron Glieberman: Former Brown iGEM Team Members who helped train and guide us, setting a high standard for all future iGEM Mentors.
Dr. Guido Paesen, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Oxford: for providing the initial inspiration to propose a project concerning the practical implications of a histamine binding protein, and also for generously sharing rEV131.
Dr. Loren Looger, Howard Hughes Medical Institute: for the use of his computational protein design program to calculate mutations that would transform Tar’s aspartate binding pocket to one that selectively binds histamine.
Dr. Masayori Inouye, Rutgers University: for his generous provision of Tar-EnvZ.
Dr. Luciano Marraffini, Sontheimer Lab at Northwestern University, for the provision of plasmid pLM6, a shuttle vector between S.epidermidis and E.coli.
Dr. Reinholb Bruckner, for the provision of shuttle vectors PRB474 and PRB473.
