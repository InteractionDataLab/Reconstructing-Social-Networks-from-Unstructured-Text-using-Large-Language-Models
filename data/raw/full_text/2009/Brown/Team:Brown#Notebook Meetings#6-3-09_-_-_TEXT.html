Brown iGEM Meeting
June 2, 2009
WebEx Conference Call
Attendees: Steph, Will, Indu, Eli, Michael
8:20: Steph will be researching S. Aureus expression vectors, and the natural levels of Staph in the nasal colony
8:25: We are looking into nanoparticle repressor system for Safe Cell
8:31: For Histamine – We are going to focus on making a bifunctional protein – EV131 and IGE antibody binding protein
The protein will be made by a Staph strain endogenous to the nasal colony
We are targeting specifically the symptoms of Hay fever
Secretion and uptake into the bloodstream needs to be researched.
8:36: We should look at past iGEM projects to see if any other teams have done projects with similar aspects as our current 2
Have any teams worked with S. epidermidis, or any gram positive bacteria?
8:42: Since S. aureus might be dangerous to work with in the lab, we can do proof of concept with another well-studied gram positive bacteria
8:44: Indu will put up the Histamine step by step project design
8:47: For Safe Cell, we need to research the additional novel kill switch for the 3rd way to kill a cell.
We also need to find a solid repressor system.
8:55: S. epidermidis is endogenous to the nose!
Can we order colonies of S. epidermidis? Eli is looking at that.
9:00: Will is researching everything about S. epidermidis
Eli is looking into secretion / uptake
Indu and Michael are looking into creating a bifunctional proteins
9:02: Flora, can you start looking up nanoparticles in a repressor system?
Ahmad, we need you to look into a 3rd killing mechanism for the cell.
Everyone should start fleshing out potential project designs.
9:04: Indu will be making a list of “materials” we need
Can we get Histamine plates? Or IGE Antibody plates? Where can we get these?
How can we test binding affinity? We will having our binding proteins on a stationary phase. Wash over with fluorescent protein. (?)
9:11: As you can see there are a lot of things to be researched! There is a new sign up sheet on the Google group.
9:14: Next meeting is Monday 6PM Pacific Time.
