iGEM 2009 Meeting
May 4, 2009
6:13PM: Meeting starts in SFH Auditorium. Discussed War War Ko’s name.
6:14: Project ideas. Adding Minoo’s “Pro Bread” to the list
Yeast that makes amino acids (I, L, V) and packages
6:25: Pulling out E. Colirs
6:29: Stephanie suggests T shirts
6:31: https://2009.igem.org/Team:Brown
This is the iGEM Team Wiki that we can customize
6:37: Tick and Treat
Need to find out what histamine does after it binds to a histamine receptor
EV131 HBP is a potential part to submit
Addressed the liver targeting protein issue – need to control this to make sure it grabs a histamine before it is uptaked by liver
Delivery system
Timeline?
7:01: Safe Cell
Will – “This is how we can prevent government regulation”
Implementation: RFC biobrick – as part of the standard for making a device, you would have to have these genes included.
Applicable to prokaryotes and eukayotes
Media vs gel – we can put the repressor in the gel
Refine holin slide
Transcriptional repressor implementation?
Indu will make it asthetically pleasing
7:21: Pro Bread
Background is good but we should get to the point quicker
Issues: do yeast have all the enzymes to make the essential amino acids?
Yes. If so, then we can upregulate these enzymes
Can we produce gram quantities?
Will depleting pyruvate affect cells ability to make amino acids because we are depleting some of its ATP source
Can we FIND the rate limiting step of yeast ILV biosynthesis pathways? Upregulating this step will produce more amino acids
Negative feedback – can we prevent this? Packaging?
7:54: Eli’s Cog Sci Project
7:58: Histamine: Indu, Eli, Ashley
Safe Cell: Ahmad, Michael, Flora
Pro Bread: Minoo, Will, Steph
7:59: NEXT MEETING: Thursday afternoon 3:00 PM
BRING YOUR FINAL POWERPOINTS!! And make the changes.
