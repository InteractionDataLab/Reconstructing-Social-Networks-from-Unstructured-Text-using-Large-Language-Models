BioSafety Meeting with Chris Harwood
June 19, 2009
Can we use a BSL2?
Need Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
Chris can get a provisional approval, doesn’t know how fast turnaround is
Might need biosafety cabinet
What does he need to see?
Needs MSDS from actual source for him to review
For the strain from Ireland, no MSDS available, might need as much information as possible
S. aureus and S. epi strain in Microbiology Course?
Need to use S. epidermidis
Give him a very detailed explanation of the both S. aureus and S. epidermidis strain BEFORE TUESDAY MORNING
Instead of MSDS
Site peer review journal about strain (Bungiro might help)
BMBL5 – questions about certain organisms
Health Canada (name has changed) – MSDS for infectious agents
Will tell you all information about dealing with it in lab
Biosafety@brown.edu
Talk to iGEM headquarters.
