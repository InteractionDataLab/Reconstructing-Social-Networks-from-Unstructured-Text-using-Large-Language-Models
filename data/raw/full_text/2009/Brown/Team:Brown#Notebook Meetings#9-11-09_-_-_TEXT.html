Looking for new vectors – talking to same guy that sent us PLM6
Primers designed for adapting to new vector

Will will pick 5 candidates
Team 3 update
We have OmC-RFP and Taz in pNoTat
Ashley did stratagene, however her positive control plate did not work
We can test with aspartate
Will also test ribose binding protein
If double transformation does not work, sequential transformation
