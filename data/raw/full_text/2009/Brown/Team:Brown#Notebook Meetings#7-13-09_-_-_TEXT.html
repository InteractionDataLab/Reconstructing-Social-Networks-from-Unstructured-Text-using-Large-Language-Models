iGEM Meeting Minutes
July 13, 2009
9:00 AM
SFH 218
9:07AM: Team 1 update
Sent out EV131 for sampling last week, the gene is in there
EcoR1 and BamH1 digest is not working
There is a mistake in the primers… They added an inadvertent ATG in the prefix. They designed new ones and will run them by Gary.
Now its just getting the appropriate primers with appropriate restriction sites, they will order T7 and T3 primers
Gary suggests placing the enzymes in Styrofoam to keep it stable
After digest, ligate into pGEM, then into pNoTat
9:22: Team 2 update
Last week they sent their project proposal to Looger
Received secretion tag from Geneart, made a nice lawn, miniprepped
Digest is hard because it is difficult to resolve small DNA
Run in a higher percentage gel (1.5% - 2%)
Received PCR primers for Agr operon, however PCR will not work
What do you do now? It would be a good control to use the previous S. epi genomic DNA as a PCR reaction that works.
When doing digest on PCR product, incubate overnight.
9:40: Team 3 update
Current goal is to get all genes functional in RU1012 strain.
Last week worked on OmpC over TetA, did 2 digests, 1st one showed a good digest but wrong enzymes. 2nd digest with correct enzymes did not have any cuts.
We will be doing the digest again.
Eli suggests using another gene besides TetA that will allow weakly expressing cells to survive
Mutagenic primers designed
Small molecule library will be used to screen
10:00: Gary will be out Thursday until all next week.
