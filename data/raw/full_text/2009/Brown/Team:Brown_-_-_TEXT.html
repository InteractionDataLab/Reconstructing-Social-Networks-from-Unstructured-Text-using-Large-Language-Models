Every year, over
fifty million people
in the US suffer from
allergic rhinitis
, the most common type of allergy. Allergens such as pollen, dust, and dander result in nasal congestion, itching, burning, sneezing, and overall
discomfort
. Current treatments include over-the-counter
antihistamines
, however, side effects of these drugs include drowsiness, restlessness, and poor concentration. For patients suffering from chronic allergies and inflammation, there is a great
need for an alternative strategy
for combating allergic symptoms
without
causing
significant side effects
.
The
2009 Brown University iGEM
team worked to treat allergic rhinitis by
engineering Staphylococcus epidermidis
, a microbe endogenous to the human nasal flora, to
secrete
a recombinant
histamine-binding protein
in response to the elevated histamine concentrations of an allergic response.  The engineered strain of S. epidermidis will function as a
self-regulating drug factory in the nose
, providing relief,
without
any negative
side effects
.
 Learn more about Allergene: a synthetically engineered, self-regulating drug factory in the  nose.
 When an allergic response occurs, our system senses a change in histamine levels above  threshold and initiates an intracellular cascade, signaling cells to respond appropriately to  the increase in histamine concentration.
 EV131 is a high-affinity histamine binding protein, that originates from the saliva of a  female tick species.
 The chassis of choice  for production and secretion of the Histamine Binding Protein is  Staphyloccocus Epidermidis, an organism endogenous to the human nasal flora. A quorum  sensing mechanism was also incorporated to regulate cell density.
 What happens when an allergy attacks: Description of the overall construct mechanism in  S.epidermidis incorporating the histamine sensor, intracellular signal cascade, and  transcription of EV131 ligated to secretion peptide.
