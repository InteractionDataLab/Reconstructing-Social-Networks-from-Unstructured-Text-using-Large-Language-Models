07/16/09 - 07/23/09
Date: 07/16/09
We are going to use pSB1A3 instead of PSB1C3 (Ampicillin resistance instead chloramphenicol resistance). We are transforming cells with them.
Date: 07/17/09
We miniprep the DNA from the overnight liquid cultures of pSB1A3-RFP. Now, we are digesting pSB1A3 with EcoRI and SpeI according to the same protocol from 07/15/09). We are using 11ul of SB1A3 plasmid DNA (500ng at 6.2ng/ul) to make 20ul of double digests.  We are adding 3ul of dH2O to the digest. However, the gel extraction fails because too much gel (1.2g) was cut out.
Date: 07/19/09
We are ligating Signal Peptide insert into pSB1A3 according to the following:
Ligation with a total volume of 10ul:
Linearized DNA and semi vol vector = 2 – 4 ul
1x Ligase Buffer
T4 DNA Ligase = 200ul
The gel extraction’s concentration turns out to be too low so we are redoing the digest of pSB1A3 with EcoRI+ SpeI using Tom Knights Protocol:
50ul Reaction
NEB2 Buffer/ Multicore = 5ul
pSB1A3 DNA (700ng) = 15ul
100x BSA = 0.5ul
EcoRI = 1ul
SpeI = 1ul
dH2O = 27.4ul
We run the digest program on Thermal Cycler. We are incubating the digest at 37oC for 10 hr, then at 80 oC for 20min, and at 4 oC forever or until we need it.

We have desgined the primers for Trg/Envz:
Note: They must be digested (can be either PCRed by Tag or PfuTurbo).
Name: GC, Time, Length
TrgF: 50, 65.3, 32
TrgR: 37.5, 61.3, 32
EnvzF: 48.1, 63.9, 27
EnvzR: 59.3, 71.0, 27
Date: 07/21/09
Colonies were picked from E.coli that were transformed with ligations of pSB1A3 + SP, and we started miniprep culture; insert: vector ratio of 3:1 worked best for transformation (the result for that ratio was about 5x as many colonies as 1:1 and 6:1).
Date: 07/22/09- The Plan and the Execution!
Here are results of the miniprepped pSB1A3-SP DNA:
Insert: Vector Ratio DNA Concentration (ng/ul)
3:1 69.0
6:1 94.5
We have 2 digestions running:
1) pSB1A3-SP with SpeI and PstI
2) SB1A2-GFP with XbaI and PstI
SpeI and XbaI are compatible restriction sites.
Here is our ideal plan:
SP
GFP
We have 3 tubes that, due to a labeling mishap, might have the GFP/protein in it.
We will digest and run all 3 out on a gel with the digest SB1A3-SP, and try to identify GFP by size.
Double Digest using the protocol on 7/18/09 [Total volume = 50ul]
Mystery 1: 40ul DNA (at 16ng/ul) with 2.5ul H2O- 640ng DNA
Mystery 2: 30ul DNA(at ~30ng/ul) with 12.5ul H2O- 900ng DNA
Mystery 3: 15ul DNA (at 65.5ng/ul) with 27.5ul H2O           982.5ng DNA
pSB1A3-SP: 10ul DNA(at 94.5ng/ul) with 32.5ul H2O                 1ng DNA
The digests fail, but we are able to identified Mystery 1 and 2 as GFP (possibly because the band was about the same size as pSB1A3-SP).  Now, we are growing overnight liquid culture of GFP cells. Also, we are growing plates of GFP, RFP, and LacX .
PfuTurbo PCR of full Agr  Operon:
First, resuspend Rev_Agr_EagI (19.43nm) in 194.3ul H2O to 100uM.

From the plate, we pick a colony containing SigPep – PSB1A3 ligation, and we prepare a glycerol stock for it and it is growing at 37oC overnight (12-16hr). Tomorrow, this glycerol stock will be freeze at -80 oC.
Date: 07/23/09- Mathing It Out, Take 2!
The glycerol stock for SigPep – PSB1A3 ligation that we made yesterday has been put into the -80 oC freezer. We have plated the glycerol stock solution of pSB1A3 – RA on the LB+Amp plate to test whether or not the glycerol stock works. We found out that the glycerol stock volume is less than we expected so we decide to make another glycerol stock for PSB1A3 – RA.
Calculation for making SMMP [ Total volume = 100ml]
1) 5.5 parts (55%) SMM Buffer = 55ml: a. 1M Sucrose (Molar mass = 342.29648g/mol)
1mol /L = X/ 0.055L
X12 = 18.8263g
b. 0.04M Maleic Acid (Molar mass = 116.1g/mol)
0.04mol/L = X/0.055L
X = 0.2554g
c. 0.04M MgCl2 (Molar mass = 95.211g/mol)
0.04mol/L = X/0.055L
X3 =0.0022mol
To get 0.0022mol of MgCl2 from Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (Molar mass = 203.31g/mol)
X4 = 0.4473g
Put 18.8263g
2) 4 parts (40%) 7% Panassy Broth = 40ml: 3) 0.5 parts (5%) 10% BSA = 5ml:

Date: 07/24/09- Essentials basics I …
Liquid cultures; terminator sequence and ribosome binding sequences
Take restriction digests and ligate them together, then transform cells with it.
1) Run digests out on the gel; should have bands around 3000bp and 700bp
Gel extract just GFP.
2) Ligation 3) Transformation
Ligate the GFP and SigPep overnight at 4oC.

The transformation was successful. Now we are growing 8ml liquid cultures at 1:30pm, which needs to be taken out early morning tomorrow to be miniprepped.
Date: 07/27/09- Primers
TSB plates and Tet stock solutions have been made.
2 overnight cultures growing:
1. Tet + TSB (Control) 2. Tet + TSB + S. epi.
Have ordered primers:
BioBrick Sequencing VF2
BB Seq V12
BB clone forward/rev
BB KpnI Fwd
BB Eag I Rev
TrgEnvz BB Fwd/rev
Have to design primers for Agr promoter region that reverses the strands direction.
Date: 07/28/09- Redo
Liquid S. epi cultures didn’t grow, which might be due to too much tetracycline in the medium.
I have started new cultures from glycerol stock and plate.
Date: 07/28/09- Assembly
The overnight liquid cultures didn’t grow again. It might be a good idea to order new S. epi.
The 3 possible reasons for the cells not to grow:
1) Glycerol stock? 2) TSB? 3) Tet’s concentration?
To analyze the cause(s), I will have 7 reactions running:
In liquid cultures:
1) Control = TSB +Tet 2) S. epi from new glycerol stock  + TSB (No Tet) 3) S. ep from another new glycerol stock + TSB + Tet
On plates:
4) Control = TSB + Tet 5) S. epi from the old glycerol stock + TSB + Tet 6) S. epi (old glycerol that hasn’t been working + TSB + Tet) 7) New S. epi + TSB + Tet
Going to start the assembly of OmpC + RBS + GFP + TS so that it will be ready when we make Trg-Envz. Please look at the sketches of the assembly on pg 63 -64 of the lab notebook.
Doing 4restriction digests: (1ug DNA per digest → 50ul digest)

Plates didn’t grow so we have to re-do Trg and EnvZ PCRS and ligate to pGEMT Easy.
Doing a sequential double digest of pLM6 and SigPep +GFP with KpnI then EagI. (KpnI requires no salt in the buffer {NE Buffer I} and EagI requires salt {NE Buffer III}). To make *EagI work, I will add NaCl and EagI to the digest after one hour. Protocol on Open Wetware recommends 1-5ul of SM NaCl solution → NE Buffer III is 100uM. Otherwise, I am using Tom Knight’s protocol:

Strange; pLM6 band is much smaller than expected.
Also, pSB1A2 is too large.
pAgr worked!
Now, digesting miniprepped GFP in pSB1A2 to see its size.
If that works, we can clone in pAGr directly because this is just for assembly.
We are retransforming pSB1A2 + GFP, pSB1A2 + RFP, pLM6, and both Trg EnvZs.
Back to digestion:
GFP in pSB1A2 → with EcoRI and XbaI in 5ul Buffer H.
Take 750ng from [72ng/ul ]

This produces the correct band!
Now, ligate the gel extract pSB1A2 lin overnight with pAgr digest at 4oC.

The transformation worked! The 25ul ones were better because it has less bacteria growing so easier to pick out single colonies.
Making overnight cultures from the plates with transformed cells:

Debugging pLM6
1. Digest pLM6 (retransformed) with addt’s enzymes – EcoRI, Pst, 500bp insert.
pLM6 #1: 5.1ul DNA , 37.4 ul H2O
pLM6 #2: 6 ul DNA, 36.5 ul H2O + 5ul NEB 4 (with 0.5ul BSA), 0.5ul BSA, 1ul of each enzyme.
2. Sequence pLM6 (retransformed) – look for sequencing promoter. 3. Retransform original pLM6 with DH5 alpha cells selected in Chloramphenicol. 4. Run retransformed miniprepped pLM6 on a gel with digested ones.
Glycerol stocks with Amp were made for Trg EnvZ 390 and pAgr - pSB1A2 (3:1). They are in 37oC incubator and is being grown overnight with constant shaking.

We got B. subtilis BD170 with B. subtilis – S. epi shuttle vector pC194 from AICC. Vector has the ChR and a hind II site. B. subtilis arrived in freeze dried form; we inoculated LB *medium with 10ug/ul Ch with freeze dried B. subtilis and grew for 10 hrs. Then it was miniprepped to get pC194 out. The miniprep has low concentrations (~ 10ug/ul). Plates 1ul each of B. subtilis liquid cultures onto Ch plates.
Date: 09/14/09
I grew up more B. Subtilis and miniprepped them. I did minipreps of 3ml of 20hr B. subtilis liquid culture and got high plasmid DNA yield (50 – 80ng/ul).
Attempting to electorporate S. epi with miniprepped pC194 using BioRad electroporator protocol. We are growing control cultures from each of the 2 attempts at making competent cells (3ml TSB + 3ul Tet). Electroporating 3ul of [80ng/ul] pC194 miniprep into 50ul of first electro-competent batch of S. epi. Electroporating 2 of 50ul aliquots from the second in an attempt to make electro-competent S.epi. They are plated on to Ch plates for 36 – 48hrs. Electroporating using standard S. aureus program in BioRad machine.

4hr incubation at 37oC (in hermal cycler) + 20min at 80oC to inactivate enzyme.
Next, the SigPep + GFP (474) and pAgr + GFP (473) need to be cut out and it is best if they are linearized.

Electroporation didn’t work again. Could it be that we didn’t grow post electroporated cells in a subinhibitory concentration of antibiotic.
So, today, electroporate, grow each in TSB+Tet and TSB + Amp but before plating, grow for an hour in SMMP + Low Amp Concentration (with) for Amp plates and (without) for *Tet plates.

Miniprepped pGA –mRBP (modified RBP in the geneart plasmid).
Started liquid culture of RBS (BBa _B0030) and “CAT” (BBa_J3100S).
No growth on S. epi plates yet.
Date: 10/11/09
There is growth in all of the liquid cultures:
pRB473 + pAgr +GF
BBa_J23119
pRB474 + SigPep + GFP
However, cannot do miniprep because there is no tube for centrifuging.
Need to start new cultures again for miniprep!
