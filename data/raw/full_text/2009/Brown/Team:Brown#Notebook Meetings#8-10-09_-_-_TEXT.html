iGEM Meeting 8-10-09
SFH 218
Attendees: Diana, Adrian
Team 1 update
Got EV131 into pNoTat
Growing in competent BL21
IPTG induction
Last year Team Resistance did an IPTG induction
Will do Western blot (Diana has 6-His antibody)
Team 2 update
Successfully cloned Agr operon promoter, moved into pGEM
Digested and ligated into Biobrick vector
Agr promoter + RFP growing on plates, will test quorum sensor
Electroporation failed; might be due to Tet plates, or faulty electrocompetent cells
Made Trg-EnvZ. Doing blue-white test
However, maybe did not distribute X-gal and IPTG evenly
Looger said he will get back this week about receptor
Running out of S. epi expression vector
Team 3 update
Ran SDS PAGE on Taz1, too much noise on protein gel
Tested mutagenic primers
Will send off for sequencing
Administrative stuff
Booked hotels for the Jamboree
We have 2 time slots at the Jamboree, may split up??
