iGEM Meeting 8-3-09
SFH 218
9:06: UTRA poster presentation. Call Kinko’s and let them know. Or contact Judy Nathanson for printing next door for much cheaper.
9:08: Gary will be out Thursday to Thursday. Poster practice on Wednesday.
9:13: Team 1 update
EV131 is in pNoTat
Making BL21 competent – need T7 polymerase; greater control over gene expression
When running protein gel, run control cell w/o bacteria. To purify protein, will get 6-His antibodies and nickel columns.
Possible binding assays – run against stationary histamine. Running free histamine.
Threshold level of allergic rhinitis discussed.
WE SHOULD INCLUDE ON POSTER the affinity information about EV131
Also include considerations.
What next after we get EV131 binding? Gary belabors.
9:40: Team 2 update
Assembled Sec-GFP. Waiting on primers to amplify and drop into expression vector
Also building Trg-EnvZ
Working on making S. epi electrocompetent
Timeline: make electrocompetent S. epi. Transform with expression vector. By end of week have expression in S. epi.
Get a picture of S. epi on the microscope. Screen for contaminants.
Also ordering primers for ccdB.
9:46: Gary’s advice about gel extractions
Either run multiple lanes and combine, or run a big well
9:55: Team 3 update
Now working with RFP as a selection marker
Now using assembly service to build OmpC-RBS-RFP-DT. We need to focus on Taz1 mutation.
Testing mutagenic primers this week.
10:06: Wednesday at 3PM. Poster practice.
