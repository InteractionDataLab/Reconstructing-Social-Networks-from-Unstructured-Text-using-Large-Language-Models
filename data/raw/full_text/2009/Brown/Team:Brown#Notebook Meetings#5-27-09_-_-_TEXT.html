Brown iGEM 2009
Phone Conference
5/27/09
(Pacific Time)
8:20PM: Meeting starts after a lot of technical difficulties
8:22: Brad Lowell at Harvard does not have UCP2, Invitrogen may have it looked up UCPs on invitrogen
What expression vectors has the past iGEM teams used?
We need E. coli expression vectors
8:32 Ahmad, ask them for the UCP
8:29: Indu wrote a nicely worded email.
8:31: Picking holins (there’s 3000!)
There are some in the registry
UC Berkeley from last year used Holin
Ahmad will ask them for a couple Holins
8:49:  CCDB – stops cell growth – can be another redundant mechanism
It is in the registry
8:56: All of the parts so far are in the registry, we need a unique part to submit to the registry
9:01: We need to schedule a meeting with the panel for when we get back!
June 17th
Email the professors
It would be nice to have Gary Wessel email them.
9:08: Michael write an email out to the professors inviting them
Have the draft proofread by the group
Have Wessel forward it to everybody
9:15: Somebody else – research a tight repressor!!
9:17: Indu will follow up phone call the lab for the tick protein
Second idea to the histamine binding protein – have something that also binds IgE antibodies
This provides redundancy – both binding current histamine and stopping further secretion of histamine
Link them with glycine bridge
9:26: Probiotic system: natural bacteria that secretes protein into bloodstream
We have getting it into the system from MIT yogurt
We have intestinal implantation BactoKidney
How do we get the bifunctional protein secreted?
9:44: There is a lady named Edith that Will will email – she can help us on probiotic drug transport across organs
Ashley, Eli, Will, Minoo can research probiotic
9:45: Indu found a paper on protein that binds IGE antibody – she will put it on the google group
Somebody needs to research IGE
Eli will put up a paper about packaging
Will is emailing about drug delivery systems
9:46: Any paper that may be useful to either project will be put on the google groups
9:56: Before 8pm PST – everyone go on the google group and build on the research that’s already been done.
10:00: Secretion: Eli, Will, Ashley
OK everyone just decide what to research on the google group.
10:01: We are meeting on SUNDAY MAY 31 SAME TIME (Monday for Minoo)
10:02: Put up minutes.
10:16: bye everybody
