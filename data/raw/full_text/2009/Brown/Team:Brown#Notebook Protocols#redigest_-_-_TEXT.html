DNA digestion protocol & hints
Overview: Although it is pretty standard to digest DNA with restriction enzymes, here is a standardized protocol and some hints…
Materials:
• DNA sample in water or TE buffer
• 10x digestion buffer
• restriction enzyme
• DNA loading buffer
• Agarose gel 0.8% (or different depending on expected band sizes)
Procedure:
1. Pipet the following into a microfuge tube:
20 µl reaction 50 µl reaction  DNA 0.1 to 4 µg 0.1 to 4 µg  10x Digestion  buffer 2  µl 5 µl  Enzyme (as appropriate)  Water (Rest of volume)
2. Add the enzyme (1-5u/µg DNA)
3. Incubate at recommended temperature for an hour.
4. Take 2 to 5 µl of the digested sample, add loading buffer, and run on agarose gel to  check the result.
Tips:
1. DNA:
• For checking DNA, use 0.1 µg; (or 4-8 µl from a good DNA mini prep)
• For cloning, 4 µg DNA is enough
2. Buffer: besides the buffer that comes with the enzyme, buffers from other company  can be used, too (as long as the contents are the same)
3. Enzyme: the maximum volume that an enzyme can be used is 1/10 of the total  reaction volume (example: 2 µl for 10 µl reaction)
4. Incubation time: can be longer than 1 hr, but don’t do overnight digestion if you don’t  have to (genomic DNA requires overnight digestion)
5. Gel: make sure to run the uncut DNA along with the digested DNA.  And, always run a DNA marker!
