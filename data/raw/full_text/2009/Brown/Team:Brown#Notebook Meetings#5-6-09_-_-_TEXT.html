iGEM 2009 Meeting
May 6, 2009
5:09: Meeting begins in SFH 218, with Adrian and Dana. Today we are presenting our powerpoints for Friday’s panel meeting
5:09: Minoo: engineering yeast used to make breast to upregulate production 3 essential amino acid
A: LEU3 promotes transcription of genes that produces more amino acids
B: Increase production of pyruvate: amylase breaks down starch to produce more pyruvate; genes for this have already been made
C: packaging and secretion by ILVp gene – package into ILV rich proteins
Adrian: why don’t we find an endogenous protein in yeast that has high ILV content
Steal some pathways from Rice 2007
5:29: Indu: solving allergies
Pro biotic – can we induce the protein secretion into the blood?
5:59: CCDB – 3rd mechanism poisons DNA gyrase
It’s in the registry
Leaky promoters ? issue of cell dying when you want it to live
Find balance where expression of UCP is enough and where leakiness doesn’t affect cells
Selective pressure to keep the plasmid
If the UCP is not made then it will be mutated and not work
