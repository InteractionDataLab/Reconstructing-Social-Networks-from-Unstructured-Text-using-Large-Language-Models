Mast cells release histamine during the allergic response.
Histamine binds to our re-engineered histamine receptor.
This receptor’s intracellular kinase domain EnvZ phosphorylates transcription factor OmpR.
OmpR turns on transcription of DNA under the OmpC promoter.
The genes for rEV131 with its attached secretion signal are transcribed.
After translation, the signal peptide causes rEV131 to be secreted into the extracellular fluid.
rEV131 sequesters histamine, preventing it from interacting with the human histamine receptors.
The transcription and secretion of rEV131 continues as long as histamine is present in the extracellular fluid. When histamine concentration returns to its pre-allergic response state, production of rEV131 stops because the initiating ligand histamine is no longer present.
