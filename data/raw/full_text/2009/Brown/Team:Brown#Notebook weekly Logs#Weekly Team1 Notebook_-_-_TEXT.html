Histamine Binding Protein Weekly Lab Log
Week 3: June 29 – July 3, 2009
Monday Lab Meeting:
Team 1 is working on digesting insert out of pBluescript using ECOR1 and BAMH1
pVU2 Site→ use to analyze digest of plasmid
When cloning inserts into vectors: make sure insert sequence is in frame
Keep in mind the reading frame when cloning into pNO-TAT→ check for additional sequences on both ends of inserts
Adrian’s Restriction Digest Suggestions:
1 unit of enzyme cuts 1µg DNA ~1 hour
Use narrow wells with 0.5 µg DNA, wide wells with 4.5 µg DNA
Digest mastermix
Can cut with enzyme again if not sure whether plasmid
Week Summary:
6/29
Ran gel of last Friday’s troubleshooting digests performed on various plasmids to confirm enzyme efficiency
Recorded DNA concentrations for last Thursday’s minipreps→  medium-high concentrations
Re-ran digest since troubleshooting digest was successful→  unsuccessful digest

PCR primers with restriction sites engineered arrived via FedEx
6/30
PCR rxn of pBluescript w/ insert using primers that came in on 6/29 performed
Re-ran digest from 6/29 with great care; mastermix used
Sequences of pBluescript and pNOTAT examined to be in frame
Learnt how to re-suspend primers
7/1
Ran improved PCR with adjusted temperatures and using Green Mastermix with Taq
New troubleshooting restriction digest performed: digested 5 different plasmids
Read binding affinity papers sent by Steph, and also read through pGEM vector kit protocol
Week 4: July 6 – July 10 2009
Monday Lab Meeting:
Failed digests and PCR- could it be poor technique, or insert not in pBluescript?
Drop off fedex at Biomed front desk for sequencing; get package out to Yale right away
Hope to isolate EV131 insert at least by the end of the week, if not earlier
Suggestions:
Run lower percentage gel to get resolution between 3000 and 3500, usually run 1% gel
Run a couple of individual digests with individual enzymes
PCR: Amplify any other template alongside as a control
Week Summary
7/6
Dropped of samples for sequencing
Ran digests of EV131 + individual enzymes (ECOR1, BAMH1, ECO&BAM, and “GUS” control plasmid + ECOR1)
Ran digest on a low resolution gel (1%-0.8%) to see difference between 3&3.5 kb (linearization of DNA)
Ran digests on other plasmids (“GUS” plasmid) to test enzymes
Ran PCR of pBluescript w/ EV131 insert with new primers (w/ restriction sites)
Ran control PCR of “GUS” plasmid alongside
Arian gave suggestions for improving PCR
7/7
PCR run again; however, no EV131 expected product seen on gel
Liquid culture of cells containing pBluescript plasmid→ miniprep them tomorrow
7/8
Notes on making sure insert if actually in the plasmid: either insert fail or primer fail
Will run these together:
1) T7 w/ T3:    a) 50 bp→ no insert present b) 500 bp→ an insert is present, but wrong insert selected c) 800 bp→ correct insert selected
2) M13 Forward w/ Reverse universal primers→ 570 kB 3) GUS DNA w/ T3 & T7 4) GUS DNA w/ specific primers
Miniprep of overnight liquid cultures performed; DNA concentrations recorded
7/9
PCR using T7/T3 & M13(F) & R universal primers on GUS control
169 bp is expected size of the band will be if there is no insert, 741 bp is expected size if insert is present
Expected band observed!
Week 5: July 13 – July 17 2009
Monday Lab Meeting:
Suggestions:
Order new primers with buffering nucleotides on 5’ ends (no need for reverse  complement of restriction site sequence)

Monday Lab Meeting:
0.2% IPTG to 5 mL BL21 liquid culture (5-10 µL) to induce protein expression
0.2 g for 100 mL
Week Summary:
8/10
Liquid cultures of BL21 transformed cells started on 8/7→ cell density too high
Therefore, 500µL of that 5 mL culture was removed and resuspended in 5 mL  of fresh LB media + 0.5 µL-1 µL Tetracycline→ these cultures left to grow at 37ºC for 2 hours
Following incubation, 10 µL of 1 mM IPTG added to 5 mL cultures to protein expression (10µL/5mL = 0.002 = 0.2%)
Left induced cells (6 liquid cultures induced with IPTG, 6 blank cultures as controls) for 2-5 hours. Tubes were removed after 1 hour intervals (ex. tube 1 removed after 2 hours, tube 2 removed after 3 hours)
pNOTAT-EV131 Ligation sequencing results received→ entire sequence struck through
We will redo the pNOTAT-EV131 ligation and resend for sequencing
→ Double digest of MP1 and MP2 samples (minipreps of EV131-pGEM) 7/29, using ECOR1 and BAMH1, put in incubator for 2 hours at 12 pm
RD 1 RD 2 Buffer E 2 µL          2 µL H2O 6.8 µL 10.8 µL BSA         0.2 µL 0.2 µL DNA 10 µL 6 µL ECOR1 0.5 µL 0.5 µL BAMH1 0.5 µL 0.5 µL
Gel run of double digests of pGEM-EV131 ligation→ EV131 insert gel extracted
Insert will be ligated with pNOTAT vector
Gel extraction concentrations:
260/280 Concentration (ng/µL) GE 1 1.87 10.5 GE 2 3.19 4.2
8/11
12 samples  (6 IPTG induced, 6 controls) prepared for SDS PAGE
Sample preparation included spinning down, pouring supernatant, re-suspending pellet in lysis buffer, spinning down, and loading supernatant
Undenatured samples added→ streaks visualized on gel, not very clean
Adrian: running native (undenatured) samples means you’re running a globular protein which will not allow you to visualize actual protein size because it will folded and not linearized. You run native proteins only if you need to retain biological function (ie. enzymes)
Denaturing SDS-PAGE kit ordered→ will try this tomorrow
Remaining 5 mL cell culture that was frozen was thawed and used to prepared new samples for tomorrow’s SDS PAGE
8/12
SDS-PAGE of induced and un-induced BL21 cells run for forty minutes approximately (8/11 AM)
Gel coomasie stained for approximately 4 hours (8/11 PM)
Gel de-stained overnight (8/11- picture in notebook)
Troubleshooting/Adrian’s Suggestions: Make sure there isn’t too much buffer in chamber, and that buffer level is just coating gel top
Run gel for longer maybe?
Check sample preparation
Ligation of pNOTAT (from RD on 7/30) and EV131 (8/10) performed
17.5 ng/µL pNOTAT, 10.5 ng/µL EV131
Insert mass = (3-10) x insert length/vector length x vector mass (50 g) = 6  x  (572/3000) x 50 ng = 57.2 ng
50 ng/ 17.5 ng/mL = 2.9 µL pNOTAT
57.2 ng/10.5 ng/µL = 5.4 µL EV131

Will miniprep tonight cells tonight, linearize with restriction digest, check for successful ligation on gel
Preparation of SDS-Page samples:
→Aliquot 100 µL of each sample into eppendorf →Spin for 30 seconds at 13,000 rpm →Discard supernatant →Resuspend cell pellet in 20 µL H2O
2 SDS-PAGEs run of 12 samples using new denaturing protein kit. Good resolution   (see picture in notebook)
8/14
SDS-PAGE re-run of 10µL samples remaining from yesterday
Received sequencing for pNOTAT-EV131→ positive ligation! Confirmed that it was in-frame using expacy.com
Meeting with Gary Wessel:
→ Confirmed sequencing for EV131-pNOTAT ligation → Tutorial  on using expacy.com to make sequence is in frame with vector → EV131 protein actually expected approximately 3 kDa b/c of addition of 6-His → Gary suggested we blot this gel with 6-His antibody instead of staining → Also discussed how to increase protein yield: incubate BL21 at room temperature and 37ºC cultures simultaneously→ see if it will increase yield
Today’s SDS-PAGE will not be stained→ we will transfer to Nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot→ blotting for 6-His protein
How to make SDS buffer: 50 mL of MES, 950 mL of deionized H2O
Western Blot: Part 1- Gel transfer to Nitocellulose:
→uses same chamber as SDS PAGE → Electrode set up (“Run to RED”) → Black e-→sponge→sponge→wattman paper→GEL→Nitorcellulose→wattman paper→sponge→sponge→Red e- → Set up above “sandwich” in a tray filled with buffer → Avoid air bubbles, do not touch center of gel →Move electrode + membrane sandwich to electrophoresis chamber → Pour SDS-Tris +MeOH buffer in center only, ensure no leaks →Run at 30 V for 75 mintues to allow transfer to membrane → Blot immediately, or store nitrocellulose between wattman paper at RT → Prepare solutions (Blotto, antibodies to 1:5000 dilution, etc.) for blotting
We will blot gel on Monday
Week 10: August 17 – 21, 2009
Week summary:
8/17
Ran immunoblot on nitrocellulose paper that gel was transferred to on Friday.
Results: Blank immunoblot except for the initially transferred ladder
Blotting protocol:
Reagents: 1) Blotto (50 ml 1M Tris [pH 7.5], 10.8g NaCl, 0.5 ml Tween20, 30 g non-fat dry milk) 2) Primary antibody: Anti-mouse monoclonal 6-his, 1:5000 dilution, Secondary antibody: Anti-mouse (conjugated) fluorescence, 1:5000 dilution 3) Alkaline phosphotase buffer (per liter, 50 mM Tris [pH 9.6], NaCl 10.8g, 5mM MgCl2) 4) Staining solution NBT/BCIP
Procedure: 1) Place the nitrocellulose transfer in excess Blotto. Incubate at room temp for at least 30 mins 2) React with primary antibody (rapidly thawed and diluted to 1:5000 in Blotto). Incubate at room temp, with shaking, for at least 30 mins 3) React with alkaline-phosphotase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluated to 1:5000 in Blotto). Incubate at room temp, with shaking, for at least 30 mins 4) Wash blots 2X in Blotto, for 5 minutes each and then 1X with alkaline phosphotase buffer for 5 mins 5) Pour off wash alkaline phosphotase buffer and wash 1X with 5 ml staining solution (5ml alkaline phosphotase buffer, 33ul NBT, 17ul BCIP). Agitate and monitor for several minutes.   6) To record, photograph immediately, or store dry (though it will lose some color intensity)
8/18
Re-ran SDS page gel with IPTG induced and non-induced BL21 (with pNOTAT) samples (from 8/10)
Issues with transfer process: After 15 mins, the power source was turned off due to loud beeping and restarted after 45 mins. Gel transfer was run at 22V (to avoid beeping sound) for 75 mins and clean transfer of the ladder was observed.
8/19
Immunoblot conducted on 8/18 gel transfer with following changes to procedure:
~ 30 ml blotto used for blocking
New technique for secondary antibody application: Blotto and nitrocellulose paper placed in plastic sealed pouch and then 2° antibody injected into pouch
To make 1:5000 dilution of 1° antibody, need 6ul antibody
2° antibody needed at 1:200 dilution and NOT 1:5000
Made alkaline phosphotase buffer as per protocol above.
Results: Nitrocellulose transfer shows slightly smeared band at bottom but no clear indication of EV131 protein express
Started new overnight liquid cultures of 8/7 BL21-pNOTAT transformations
8/20
Summary of troubleshooting meeting with Gary:
Discussed problems with western gel and pinpointed incorrect use of antibiotic resistance for growing transformations and liquid cultures.
BL21 cells are TET resistant, but pNO-TAT expression vectors are AMP resistant
To grow BL21 cells when making them competent have to add TET, but when transforming pNO-TAT into BL21 cells must add AMP to select only for BL21 cells with pNO-TAT plasmid
Possible to grow cells in AMP-TET or AMP plates
Transformed 8/1 pNOTAT minipreps into competent BL21 cells (using protocol from 7/31) on AMP-TET plates.
Plates showed no growth when checked at midnight. Plan to use only AMP plates for next set of transformations.
8/21
Plated transformations of pNO-TAT with EV131 into BL21 cells (from yesterday) onto AMP only resistant plates. Showed no growth again.
Repeated transformations using only MP1 (that showed positive sequencing result) and sterile loop method instead of glass beads. Showed no growth once again.
Week 11: August 24 – 28, 2009
Week summary:
8/24
Due to failed transformations of BL21 + ligated pNO-TAT plasmid decided to make new stocks of BL21 cells to redo transformation.
Specific changes: Ideal optical density = 0.3, MP DNA in transformation should be 20-30 ng
BL21 liquid culture started
8/25
BL21 liquid cultures tested for optical density
10am - #2: 0.83, #3: 0.97
12pm - #2: 0.34, #3: 0.54
Transformed pNOTAT-ev131 into new BL21 competent cells (12 pm sample) on AMP plates
8/26
No growth on AMP plates, only control TET plate showed growth
Problem: Very little 8/4 MP ligated product
Transformed MP 1-6 (8/13) and MP of pGEM ligation (7/23) as a control for AMP plate. Possible contamination on plate T5 prior to plating transformation sample.
8/27
Only plate T3 showed 5-6 single colonies to be grown up in LB overnight. Remaining plates showed no growth, incubated for 4h more, discarded when still no signs of growth.
3 liquid cultures from plate T3 showed growth, placed in new media to be miniprepped.
8/28
Prepared 2 minipreps from T3 liquid cultures to send for sequencing to confirm transformation of pNO-TAT ligated to EV131 in BL21 cells.
Nanodrop concentrations (260/280):
MP1 25.9ul (2.04)

IPTG induced samples prepared for Western Blot. Discarded because samples were too viscous to be loaded)
Colonies picked from plates 5 & 6 that were streaked with Gary’s BL21 cells. (Plates 1,2,3,4 showed no growth and are back in the incubator to see if growth occurs)
6 liquid cultures started for each plate.
