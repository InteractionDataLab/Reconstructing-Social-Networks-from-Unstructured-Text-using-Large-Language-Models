Primer resuspension
Goal: 5pM/ul. This is a 1x stock solution.
Protocol:
1) Identify the nM amount on the tube and resuspend the primers in 10x (in ul) water, e.g. 23.5 nM would be resuspended in 235 uL water. This is a 100 pM (or 0.1 nM) and is the 20x that you protect!
2) Dilute a portion of this 20x into a fresh tube, appropriately labeled, to make a 1X stock solution, or 5pm/uL. This is your working solution. Use 2uL per reaction.
3) Store at -20oC.
