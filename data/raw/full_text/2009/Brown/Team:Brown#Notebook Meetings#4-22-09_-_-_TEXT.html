iGEM 2009 Meeting
April 22, 2009
9:40PM: Meeting begins in the SciLi Basement
9:43: iGEM account, Google groups account, Mathworks; email Neil for google group invitation!
9:45: Minoo and Eli are attending the Webinar
9:46: Michael gives presentation on Bacterial Pixel
GFP, BFP, RGP components within a bacteria
Wavelength promoters need to be cloned
10:00 Flora’s project: ability to detect cancer cells, then induce apoptosis
Detecting target – binding site on breast cancer cells – using nanoparticles to identify
Once cells are identified, induce apoptosis by bringing inducer molecule
Flora will meet with them on Friday; report back; “Click Chemistry”
10:12: Indu & Minoo: prevention of allergies creating bi-functional protein – idenitify histamine & induce liver uptake
Common allergies - too much histamine
Tics secrete 3 binding histamine protein – have been cloned
EV131 in mice – binds to histamine with high affinity
Look into mechanism to fuse these 2 proteins
10:25: Will – unlike every other team on the planet let’s use RNA synthetic biology
RNA strand with UTR and translated region
Toxin trigger conformational change of RNA
Make RNA that binds to RNA strand, blocking ribosome binding
Another part of RNA has spot that binds to one molecule, allowing RNA strand to fall off
Advantage: faster mechanism of gene regulation
“Ribo-regulators”
10:38: Ahmad – specialized Safe Cell where dangerous cells will die if they escape
Cell can only produce ATP on plate
Uncouplers stop ATP synthesis
Inhibitor of uncoupler – liver x receptor alpha in media – cell dies
10:48: Ashley – eat as much as you want!
Leptin creates satiety signals, but obese individuals have large adipose, and large leptin; however, leptin receptors are not receptive
Use leptin signal to break down fats directly
Establish threshold leptin level
10:59: Stephanie – meningitis – bacteria has gene called lactate permease that when absent in mutant, mutant incapable of taking up lactose
Uses lactose instead of glucose as primary energy source
Bind something to lactose to prevent uptake
Needs adhesins
Build machine that recognizes bacteria then have gene expressed where lactose binding lactin => lactate broken down
Proposed targeting this towards lactose intolerance
11:08: Eli – sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (signaling lipids)
Spingosine is pro-apoptosis, anti-mitotic
Spingosine 1-P is anti-apoptosis, mitogenic (overexpressed in cancer cells)
Create switch that would induce cells to grow and die via ribo-regulator or regulation of transcription
11:16: Need to pick favorites
11:22: Everyone agrees on Bactopixel, Cancer-detection, and Histamine
Possibility to implicate RNA regulators into each project
Glue idea (ask Katrina)
11:27: Next meeting 9:30 to 11:30 Same Place
TEAMS
Steph & Will – ribo-regulators
Will – Glue
Minoo & Indu & Ashley – histamine
Bactopixel – Michael & Eli
Cancer – Flora & Ahmad
