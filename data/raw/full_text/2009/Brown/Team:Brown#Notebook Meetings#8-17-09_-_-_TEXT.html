Team 1 update:
Today they are making the Blotto solution with 6-His
Purchased Qiagen nickel column purification kit
After protein comes down in a nickel column
Tests for histamine binding; selective binding?
Possible ideas for after binding test; Will suggests Barnea lab competitive binding assay involving GPCR => fluorescence
Adrian suggestion: Look at crystal structure, and binding pocket; see if you can cut the rest of the protein off and make minimized histamine binding domain
Degradation mechanism?
Team 2 update:
“Chugging right along” all this before Thursday
Signal peptide construct finished in expression vector for S. epi
Agr promoter construct in S. epi
Checking Trg-EnvZ ligations tonight
S. epi is resistance to Tet
Looger sent us designs to modify Taz to a histidine receptor; then will move to histamine receptor
Team 3 update:
Mutagenic PCR….
Administrative
Bio 1950 - Fill out proposal form on bio website
Planning in advance
Practice presentation in front of people.
Google calendar? Weekly lab meetings
Wiki has to be done a week before the week its due
Cleaner lab book
Clean wiki
