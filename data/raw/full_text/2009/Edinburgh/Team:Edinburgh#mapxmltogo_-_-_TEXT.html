Togo submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report in April 2003, more than two years late. It declared a stockpile of 436 antipersonnel mines, all of which are retained for training purposes.
Togo states that it has not produced, transferred or used antipersonnel mines.[4] It has declared a stockpile of 436 antipersonnel mines of Korean origin, all of which are retained for training purposes.
Togo is not mine-affected, but the Army has mine action capability. In 1998-1999, in the context of the African ECOMOG peacekeeping force, it assisted in marking mine-affected areas in Guinea-Bissau. In 2003, five Togolese soldiers participated in a training at the regional mine clearance training center for ECOWAS member states in Ouidah, Benin. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
