<contacts> <dist> <distName>Guyana</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Guyana signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997 and ratified on 5 August 2003, becoming a State Party on 1 February 2004.
Guyana indicated in its Article 7 report that it had no stockpiled mines and no mines retained for training. This appeared to be in contradiction to other information received by Landmine Monitor indicating that a stockpile existed. In December 2000, a series of explosions leveled Camp Groomes Army Base, and it may be that all stocks of antipersonnel mines were destroyed in those explosions.
Guyana is not known to have produced, exported, or used antipersonnel mines in the past. Guyana is not mine-affected, and has no known mine survivors.
