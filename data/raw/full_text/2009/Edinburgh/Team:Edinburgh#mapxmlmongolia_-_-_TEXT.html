<contacts> <dist> <distName>Mongolia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Mongolia has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. In 2004, Mongolia announced its intention to join the treaty by 2008, through a step-by-step approach.
Mongolia is not mine-affected. In its voluntary Article 7 report, Form C on the location of mined areas was marked as “Not Applicable.” Mongolia has an extensive problem with explosive remnants of war (ERW).
In 2007, one person was killed and two were injured in two ERW incidents in Mongolia.[11] The last reported ERW casualty prior to 2007 occurred in 2005. In 2008 through 1 June, Landmine Monitor did not identify any new ERW casualties.
The total number of mine/ERW casualties in Mongolia is unknown as the State Statistical Office or independent research units do not have this kind of data. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
