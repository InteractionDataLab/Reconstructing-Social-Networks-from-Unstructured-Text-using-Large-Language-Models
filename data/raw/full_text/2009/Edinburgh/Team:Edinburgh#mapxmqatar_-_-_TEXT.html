<contacts> <dist> <distName>Qatar</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Qatar signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997, ratified on 13 October 1998, and the treaty entered into force on 1 April 1999. Qatar has taken no national legal measures to implement the treaty. In May 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar told Landmine Monitor, “There was no immediate need to formulate legislation because Qatar has not had any landmine problems and does not use landmines.”
Qatar was a full participant in the Ottawa Process and one of the few nations in the Middle East to sign the treaty in 1997. Qatar has voted in favor every annual pro-ban UN General Assembly resolution since 1996.
Qatar maintains that it has never produced or transferred antipersonnel mines. At the Fifth Meeting of States Parties in September 2003, Qatar reiterated that it has never used, produced, or exported antipersonnel mines, and that it has no stockpile of live mines. Qatar did not declare any stockpiles of antipersonnel mines in its Article 7 reports. Qatari military officers have told Landmine Monitor that Qatar possesses a small stockpile of dummy antipersonnel mines (without fuses or detonators) for training purposes.
Qatar is not mine-affected. It is not known to have contributed to any international mine action programs since 1999, although representatives did express an interest at the September 2003 Fifth Meeting of States Parties in supporting a victim assistance program. In 1999, Qatar donated $200,000 to the (Slovenia) International Trust Fund for mine action in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
