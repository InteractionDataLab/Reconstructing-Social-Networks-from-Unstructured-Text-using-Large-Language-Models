<contacts> <dist> <distName>Tanzania</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Tanzania has indicated in its Article 7 reports that there are no mined areas in the country. Although there is no evidence that mines have been planted inside Tanzania, there are mine survivors from Burundi and the DRC are found in Tanzania. Tanzania borders countries in the west that have witnessed violent conflicts and, historically, Tanzania has hosted refugees from Uganda, Rwanda, DRC and Burundi. Since the end of 2002, there have been few refugee arrivals in Tanzania as entry points into Tanzania from the neighboring countries were closed; most activities are now geared toward voluntary repatriation from Tanzania. In 2004, border crossings into Burundi began to re-open.
Tanzania’s main link to the landmine problem is the refugee population entering from neighboring countries, although a few nationals have reportedly been killed or injured in the border areas. The last reports of mine casualties occurred in 1999: two men were killed in a mine explosion while cultivating land at the border; a young boy was killed while grazing cattle in the Ngara district in the north-west; and a Tanzanian man was injured in Burundi while conducting cross-border trade. In 2003, three Tanzanian nationals were killed in a mine incident in Makamba province in Burundi.
