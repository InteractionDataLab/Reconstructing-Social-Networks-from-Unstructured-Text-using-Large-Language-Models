<contacts> <dist> <distName>Sudan</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Sudan is contaminated with mines and ERW, especially as a result of more than 20 years of armed struggle between the Government of Sudan and non-state armed groups in the south, mainly the SPLA. The struggle ostensibly ended with the signing of the CPA on 9 January 2005, although violence in the first half of 2008 raised fears of a return to conflict. Sudan’s borders with Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya, and Uganda are all considered mine-affected, with some mines having been laid as long ago as World War II.
The precise extent of contamination remains unclear, with UN and national authorities previously estimating that 19 of 25 Sudanese states were contaminated. However, the Landmine Impact Survey (LIS), which is being conducted on a state-by-state basis, and a number of ad hoc assessments, have given a better indication of the problem. As of December 2007, the national database–the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA)–had recorded 1,427 dangerous areas impacting 190 communities in 18 states. Survey and clearance results indicated that almost three-quarters of the areas identified as of end December 2007 were located in Southern Sudan.
In addition to continuing casualties, mines and ERW contaminate agricultural land, livestock-grazing areas, land used for collecting firewood and producing charcoal, access routes, and connection roads. Fear of mines and ERW has resulted in extensive road closures. More broadly, according to the UN, contamination also obstructs delivery of humanitarian aid, hinders the return of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), and impedes reconstruction, development and peace-building.
The total number of communities impacted by mines and UXO was 202 (23 high, 64 medium, and 115 low impact), affecting an estimated 1.3 million people, with an additional 550,000 returnees expected to come back to the impacted communities. The total number of suspected hazardous areas (SHAs) was 442, covering an estimated 54km2 with a further 324 UXO spot tasks.
In 2007, there were at least 91 new mine/ERW casualties, including 28 people killed and 63 injured in 48 incidents. Most of the casualties were civilian; seven were military/police and three clearance staff. More than half of the casualties where the age was recorded were children (40). However, this figure could be significantly higher as the age of 31 casualties was unknown.
Where age information was available, ERW was the main cause of casualties among children (30) while adults were mostly injured by antipersonnel mines. For 40 casualties the activity at the time of the incident was unknown. Tampering was the main cause of casualties where the activity was known (21), mostly involving ERW and causing 18 child casualties (14 boys). The second most common activity was playing/recreation (eight), also causing predominantly child casualties (seven).
