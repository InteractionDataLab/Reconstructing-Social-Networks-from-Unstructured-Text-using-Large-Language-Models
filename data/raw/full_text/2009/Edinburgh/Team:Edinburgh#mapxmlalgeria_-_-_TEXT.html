<contacts> <dist> <distName>Algeria</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Algeria is contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), mainly unexploded ordnance (UXO) from World War II, the conflict to end French colonial occupation, and the insurgency of the 1990s.
In 2003, the government estimated that 3,064,180 mines contaminated 56.76km2 along 1,049km of the Challe and Morice lines, in the eastern border area with Tunisia, and the western border area with Morocco. In October 2007, an Algerian newspaper reported that records relating to the minefields laid by French troops in 1956–1959 along the Challe and Morice lines in the east and west of the country had “finally” been handed over to Algeria. A statement from the French embassy in Algiers indicated that the move aims at “removing the obstacles inherited from the past and building relations of trust with Algeria.” In April 2008, however, Algeria stated that the maps had not resulted in any previously unknown mined areas being identified.
The north of the country is contaminated by an unknown number of homemade mines and explosive items laid by insurgent groups and 15,709 antipersonnel mines laid by the Algerian army around installations. Algeria has also stated that some “locations that still need clearance in the center of the country continue to be targeted by the insurgent groups.” As of April 2008, 4,713 mines remained to be cleared from the total laid by the army in the north. This was the same number as in April 2007.
Landmine/ERW Casualties
In 2007, Landmine Monitor identified at least 78 new mine/ERW/IED casualties (30 killed and 48 injured) in 19 incidents. This represents an increase compared to 2006 (58 casualties) and is the highest casualty rate since 1999. However, due to limited data collection, the casualty rate may be higher.
Most casualties were military or police (54) and at least 24 were civilians. Among civilians most were men (12), followed by boys (8), girls (two), women (one), and unknown gender (one). Two casualties were Ukrainian nationals and two others were Russian.  Casualties continued to be reported in 2008 with at least 10 mine/ERW/IED casualties (six killed and four injured) in six incidents. Half the casualties were civilians and half were military. Casualties included five military, three boys, one girl and one man. Victim-activated IEDs caused six casualties, antipersonnel mines three, and ERW one.  ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
