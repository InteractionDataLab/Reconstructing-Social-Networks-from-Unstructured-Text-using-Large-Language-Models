<contacts> <dist> <distName>Djibouti</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Djibouti signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified on 18 May 1998, becoming a State Party on 1 March 1999.  Djibouti has reported that it has not produced antipersonnel mines. It is not known to have ever exported mines. Both the government and the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy used landmines around military positions and on access roads during the 1991–1994 civil war.
On 2 March 2003, one day after its treaty-mandated deadline, the country destroyed its stockpile of 1,118 antipersonnel mines. Djibouti has retained 2,996 antipersonnel mines for training purposes.
Djibouti has a small residual problem with explosive remnants of war (ERW), primarily unexploded ordnance, and possibly mines, but with the completion of mine clearance by France in May 2008 around its ammunition storage area at La Doudah, there were no known mined areas. In June 2008, however, a border conflict between Djibouti and Eritrea at Ras Doumeira raised fears of new contamination.
No new mine/ERW casualties were reported in Djibouti in 2007. The last confirmed mine casualties occurred in September 2004 when three girls were injured. On 13 January 2008, a French soldier was killed and a Tunisian soldier injured in Djibouti when a grenade exploded during a military training exercise.
The total number of landmine casualties in Djibouti is not known. Landmine Monitor identified 81 mine casualties between 1999 and 2001, including 23 people killed and 51 injured, with the status of seven unknown. According to military sources, between 1997 and 2000, 31 people were killed and 90 injured in mine incidents; the majority of casualties were military personnel.
