<contacts> <dist> <distName>Dominican Republic</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Dominican Republic signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997, ratified on 30 June 2000, and the treaty entered into force on 1 December 2000. It submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report on 26 September 2001 and its annual updated report on 28 May 2002 (which was a “nil” report).
According to its initial Article 7 Report, the Dominican Republic has not enacted domestic implementing legislation because it is not mine-affected and does not stockpile antipersonnel mines. It also does not view special implementation measures as necessary because the Armed Forces is the institution responsible for implementing the treaty and it is already legally bound by existing legislation.
The Dominican Republic cosponsored and voted in support of pro-ban UN General Assembly Resolution 56/24M in November 2001. The Dominican Republic praised the ICBL’s Landmine Monitor initiative in its initial Article 7 Report for facilitating transparency and cooperation, as well as encouraging international debate over matters related to the banning of antipersonnel mines.
