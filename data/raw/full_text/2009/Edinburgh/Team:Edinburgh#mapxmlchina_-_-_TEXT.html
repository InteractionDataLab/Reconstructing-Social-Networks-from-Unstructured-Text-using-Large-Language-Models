The United States estimated in the 1990s that China had planted some 10 million mines along these borders. China reported in December 1999 that the mine threat on its side of the border with Vietnam, namely, Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, “has been basically removed” following major clearance operations between 1992 and 1999. At that time, however, the border had not been fully demarcated and several dozen square kilometers of land where minefields remained were disputed.
The government has reported that there were no landmine/ERW casualties within China or among Chinese citizens outside of China in 2007 and through June 2008. Chinese authorities maintain that no new mine casualties have occurred since the completion of mine clearance activities in 1999.
In 2007, however, two new antipersonnel mine casualties were reported from two incidents in China; both were injured. The casualties occurred in September and November in Yunnan province. One casualty was a man who was injured close to the border with Vietnam. In addition, a Chinese deminer was injured in Lebanon in March 2008. Due to a lack of public information about mine/ERW casualties in China and incomplete data collection, there might be more casualties.
In 2006, the government reported no new mine/ERW casualties in China.However, the rehabilitation center of Red Cross Society of China Yunnan Branch (RCSC-Yunnan) assisted one person who reportedly had a landmine incident in 2006.
The total number of mine/ERW casualties in China is not known; Landmine Monitor has identified 5,707 mine/ERW casualties (4,208 survivors) between 1979 and 2000. Between 2004 and the end of 2007, the RCSC-Yunnan assisted 294 mine/ERW survivors and landmines were the third largest cause of amputation (23%).
