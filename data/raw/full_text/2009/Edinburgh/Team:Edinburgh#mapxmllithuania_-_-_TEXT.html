<contacts> <dist> <distName>Lithuania</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Lithuania is not facing very serious problems with landmines and UXO left from military operations during World War II, though these “remnants of war” from World War II are described as rather commonplace finds. There are no maps available showing contamination with explosives, and Lithuania does not have a national mine clearance plan.
In recent years special units have been formed, and deminers are equipped with Shebel, Valun (Austrian), MSG-75 (German), IMP and RVM (Russian) mine detectors. A military engineering school has been founded in Kaunas which will serve the demining and EOD (exoplosive ordnance disposal) needs of the Baltic region; in the initial phase Danish assistance is involved.[ There has been international cooperation on mine clearance. Partners included the 871st U.S. Engineer Battalion, Swedish Mine Clearance Training Center, Danish Engineers and Chemical Defense School, German War Engineers School, ENTEC (NATO technical training center), and the 15th Polish Mine Clearance Battalion. The Lithuanian armed forces have received technical assistance from Denmark, Sweden and Germany ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
