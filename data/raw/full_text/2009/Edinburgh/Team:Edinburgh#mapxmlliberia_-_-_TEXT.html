<contacts> <dist> <distName>Liberia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Liberia is affected by ERW as a result of 14 years of internal and regional warfare involving neighboring Sierra Leone, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire. As of July 2008, there was no evidence of a residual landmine problem, although a small number of mines, primarily antivehicle mines, were used during the years of conflict. In September 2003, the UN Mine Action Service conducted an assessment mission to Liberia and found no credible reports of mine use during the conflict from 1999 to August 2003, but suggested there might be some areas still affected from previous conflicts.
In 2007 and until June 2008, no new landmine/ERW casualties were confirmed in Liberia. However, it is possible that incidents remained unreported as the British NGO, Landmine Action, who previously provided casualty information, temporarily suspended operations in July 2007 due to lack of funding.
