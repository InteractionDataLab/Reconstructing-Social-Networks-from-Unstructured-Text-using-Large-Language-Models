<contacts> <dist> <distName>Brazil</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Brazil signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997, ratified on 30 April 1999, and the treaty entered into force on 1 October 1999. National implementation legislation, Law 10.300, took effect on 1 November 2001. Brazil submitted its fifth Article 7 transparency report, covering the year 2003, on 30 April 2004.
Brazil has stated that there are no mined areas and no areas suspected of containing landmines in territory under its jurisdiction.
In 2003 and the first half of 2004 Brazil continued to participate in international humanitarian mine action efforts on a bilateral and multilateral basis, with ten military technical experts deployed to the MARMINCA demining program in Central America under the auspices of the OAS. A Brazilian officer headed the OAS MARMINCA team from January 2003 to January 2004.
There have been some Brazilian landmine casualties in the past, but no precise number is available. In 1997, a Brazilian Navy Captain lost his leg, while an Army Captain was injured in 1999, both on MARMINCA demining duties. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
