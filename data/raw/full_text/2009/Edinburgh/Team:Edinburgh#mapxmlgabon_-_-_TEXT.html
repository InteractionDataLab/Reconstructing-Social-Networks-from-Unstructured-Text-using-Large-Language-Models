<contacts> <dist> <distName>Gabon</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Gabon signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997, ratified it on 8 September 2000, and became a State Party on 1 March 2001. At the May 2001 intersessional Standing Committee meetings in Geneva, Gabon distributed a document labeled as Article 7 Report, Form A (National Implementation Measures). It indicated that a national authority charged with implementing the provisions of the Mine Ban Treaty is being established.
However, Gabon is not known to have taken any domestic measures to implement the Mine Ban Treaty. Its first Article 7 transparency report due on 28 August 2001 has not yet been submitted to the United Nations. An official at the Permanent Mission of Gabon at the UN in New York said the delay is because Gabon is not a mine-affected country, therefore writing the Article 7 Report did not merit serious attention. He promised to take necessary action for Gabon to fulfill its treaty obligations.
Gabon did not attend the Third Meeting of States Parties in Managua, Nicaragua in September 2001. It did not participate in the intersessional Standing Committee meetings in Geneva in January or May 2002. Gabon cosponsored and voted in favor of UN General Assembly Resolution 56/24M on 29 November 2001, promoting the Mine Ban Treaty.
Gabon has never produced or exported antipersonnel mines. In January 2001, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official told Landmine Monitor that Gabon has a small quantity of antipersonnel mines for training purposes.[4] A Gabon official told a regional landmine conference in Bamako, Mali, in February 2001 that Gabon has no stockpile of antipersonnel mines. The May 2001 document states that Gabon does not possess antipersonnel mines.
Gabon is not mine-affected and there have been no reports of mine casualties. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
