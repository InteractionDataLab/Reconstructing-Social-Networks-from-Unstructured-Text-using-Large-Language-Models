<contacts> <dist> <distName>Hungary</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[In its Mine Ban Treaty Article 7 reports, Hungary indicates that it has no mined areas. In its 2003 CCW Article 13 report, Hungary stated that there are “no identified or suspected minefields” and therefore no mine clearance programs in Hungary. However, some areas in Hungary are contaminated by unexploded ordnance (UXO) and, to a lesser extent, by mines. Areas in which mine/UXO contamination deriving from World War II and the subsequent Soviet occupation has been found include Pest, Fejer, Komaron-Eszetgom, Veszprem, Gvor, Vas, Nagybajom, the Pilis Hills, and Lake Balaton. During the break-up of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, mines were also laid by Yugoslav forces on a 66-kilometer section of Croatia’s border with Hungary.
In 2002, there were 2,645 reports of mines and other suspicious explosive objects, resulting in examination of 34,230 square meters of land. A total of 359,802 explosive items was found, including 1,142 mines in 58 locations. Fifteen of the mines were active; two of these were antipersonnel mines. Since World War II, the Regiment has destroyed 20 million mines and UXO, clearing an area totaling 10 square kilometers. Most minefields were cleared from 1945-1957; since then the Regiment has been engaged with newly discovered mine/UXO contamination.
On the mined section of the border with Croatia, the Hungarian Border Guard reported in February 2003 that “there are still many dangerous locations near the border.”
