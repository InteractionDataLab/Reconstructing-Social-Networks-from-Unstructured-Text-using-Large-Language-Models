<contacts> <dist> <distName>Indonesia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Indonesia is not believed to be mine-affected but has a limited problem with explosive remnants of war (ERW) and victim-activated improvised explosive devices (IEDs). It declared it had no mined areas in its initial Article 7 report.
In 2007, there were at least eight new casualties from victim-activated IEDs  and ERW  in Indonesia in three separate incidents with two killed and six injured; all were male civilians (including seven boys) and all incidents occurred in Aceh province. This is an increase from five casualties reported in 2006 (five boys).
Casualties continued to occur in 2008. On 13 February, a 10-year-old boy was injured while playing with ERW in East Peureulak subdistrict, in the East Aceh regency of Aceh province.  The total number of mine/ERW/IED casualties in Indonesia is unknown. Few casualties have been reported in recent years, but Landmine Monitor identified at least 45 mine/ERW/IED casualties between 2001 and 2007, of whom 12 were killed and 33 injured.
