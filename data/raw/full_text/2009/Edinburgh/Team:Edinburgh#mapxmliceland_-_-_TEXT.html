<contacts> <dist> <distName>Iceland</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Iceland signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997, ratified it on 5 May 1999 and became a State Party on 1 November 1999. National implementation legislation was reportedly being prepared in June 2000, yet in January 2001 Iceland noted that the “need for special law relating to the implementation of the Mine Ban Convention is currently under consideration.”
Although Iceland has no military forces of its own, it is a member of NATO and has a bilateral defense agreement with the United States. As noted in last year’s Landmine Monitor, it is unclear whether Iceland would permit a non-Mine Ban Treaty party such as the US to stockpile or transfer antipersonnel mines on or through Icelandic territory, or assist US forces with mine-related activities prohibited under the Mine Ban Treaty.
Iceland has stated that it “has never been in possession of antipersonnel landmines nor have such mines been produced in Iceland.” Iceland is not mine-affected.
Iceland focuses its contributions to mine action on victim assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and by June 2000 about US$1 million had been spent out of US$1.3 million allocated. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[<]]></email> </dist>
