Bolivia has reported on several occasions, including in its Article 7 report, that it has never produced, exported, or used antipersonnel mines and it has no stockpiles, including any mines retained for training.
Bolivia is not mine-affected, but the border with Chile was mined by Chile in the 1970s, particularly in 1978 during a territorial dispute. There is no information available on the extent of the cazabobo problem in the Chapare region.
In March 2003, a Bolivian national and a Chilean national smuggling drugs across into Chile were reportedly injured by an antipersonnel mine. The government, however, denies that any mine casualties took place along the border in 2003 and Landmine Monitor has not been able to verify the report. Since 1999, Landmine Monitor identified only one other landmine incident in Bolivia. On 26 May 2000, a peasant from Jankomarca, Villarroel province, in La Paz department, lost part of his left foot while crossing the border ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
