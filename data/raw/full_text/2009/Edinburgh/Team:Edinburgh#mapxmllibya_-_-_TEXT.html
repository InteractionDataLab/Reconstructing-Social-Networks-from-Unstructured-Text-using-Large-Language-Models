<contacts> <dist> <distName>Libya</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Libya is contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), mainly unexploded ordnance (UXO), as a result of the World War II campaign in North Africa, as well as wars with Egypt in 1977 and Chad from 1980–1987. The borders with Chad, Egypt, and Tunisia are affected by mines and UXO, as are areas in the north and south of the country. Minefields are said to exist in deserts, ports, and urban areas.
The precise extent of the problem is not known as no nationwide survey has been conducted. There are no maps of mines on the border with Chad, but maps are said to exist for those laid on the border with Egypt. Germany and Italy have handed over maps of minefields to Libya in the last few years. In 1998, Italy had signed an agreement in which it pledged to provide Libya with historical records, technical assistance, and training for Libyan deminers.
The current impact of mines in Libya is unclear, although in the past agriculture and livestock are said to have been severely affected. A Libyan organization under the auspices of the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation, the De-mining Society (also known as the Anti-Mines Association), claims that its “preliminary studies” of the impact of mines in Libya concluded that mines have caused huge financial and human loss and impeded transportation, oil prospecting (especially in the south of the country), tourism, land reclamation, and pasture.
At the Eighth Meeting of States Parties, Libya stated that mine/ERW contamination “had claimed and continued to claim the lives and limbs of people in Libya.” However, the government official at the meeting was not aware of any casualties occurring in 2007. Landmine Monitor was not able to identify new mine/ERW casualties in Libya in 2007 and through June 2008. In July 2008, three police officers transporting cleared mines were reported killed when the mines blew up in their car near Tobruk.
