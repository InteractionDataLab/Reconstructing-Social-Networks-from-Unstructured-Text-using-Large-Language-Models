Antivehicle mines have been a threat in the highlands and desert in the north of the country for several years, where the army is fighting Touareg rebels from the MNJ. Other antivehicle mine explosions have occurred elsewhere in the country, notably in the capital, Niamey; in Maradi, the economic capital; and at Tahoua in the northwest.
The UNDP rapid assessment report records 14 mine incidents from 14 April to 24 November 2007, causing a total of 90 mine casualties (74 military and 16 civilian).  However, analysis of the casualty data indicates that a number of the incidents—some of which did not inflict any injuries—are not consistent with the explosion of an antivehicle mine. These are, as follows:
•	On 5 August, a truck loaded with onions 10km from Iferouane on the road to Gougaram detonated a mine causing one slight injury as a result of the shattering of the windscreen. 
•	On 5 September, outside Agadez, 7km from Azel on the road to Iferouane, another truck loaded with onions exploded a mine close to a military base. Three passengers were slightly injured. 
•	On 12 October, on the road from Agadez to Arlit, a truck exploded a mine. No injuries resulted. 
•	On 10 November, 80km from Agadez on the road to Arlit at a place called Solomi, a truck carrying goods as part of a convoy receiving military escort went off the road and exploded a mine, but again no injuries were caused. 
•	On 18 November, 50km from Agadez towards Tchirozerine a water tanker hit a mine. Again, no injuries resulted. 
•	On 24 November, 35km from Agadez on the road to Abalak, a truck exploded a mine placed in a hen’s nest on the tarmac on a bridge. One man was slightly injured in the leg. 
</P><P>Landmine/ERW Casualties
</P><P>In 2007, at least 96 new landmine casualties were recorded in Niger, including 32 killed and 64 injured in 20 incidents. Three additional incidents involving unhurt civilians were also recorded. Most of the casualties were military (63) but 33 were civilian. At least 71 of the casualties were adults. Among the civilian casualties were six men, two women and two males of unknown age; the gender and age of the other casualties is unknown. Antivehicle mines caused 33 casualties and the other casualties were caused by unspecified mines. One incident was caused by tampering, and all the others occurred while traveling/driving.
</P><P>Most casualties were recorded in the Agadez region in northern Niger (92), followed by Tahoua region in central Niger (two) and Maradi in central-eastern Niger (two). Reportedly livestock including dromedaries and cows have also been involved in incidents. Within this total, UNDP and the government recorded 90 casualties, and 33 casualties were reported in the media; six of these were not in the government/UNDP data.
</P><P>Casualties continued to be recorded in 2008 with at least five new mine casualties in two incidents (one killed and four injured). All the casualties were civilian. On 9 January 2008, a man (a well-known radio journalist) was killed and a woman injured by an antivehicle mine while driving in their car in the suburb of Yantala, west of Niamey. On 26 March 2008, three civilians were forced to drive ahead of a military convoy on the Dabaga-al-Meki road when they were injured by a mine.
