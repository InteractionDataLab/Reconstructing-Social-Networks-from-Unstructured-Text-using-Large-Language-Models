<contacts> <dist> <distName>Norway</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Norway signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 9 July 1998, becoming a State Party on 1 March 1999. Previously, in June 1995, Parliament supported a domestic ban on the production, transfer, stockpiling and use of antipersonnel landmines. In 1996, Norway became a leading member of the core group of countries in the Ottawa Process.
Norway is not considered a mine and UXO affected area. From time to time mines and explosives from World War II are discovered, but this does not represent a great danger to civilians.
As noted in the above section, Norway is a leader in providing support for mine clearance activities in mine-affected countries. The largest NGO humanitarian mine clearance organization in the world, NPA, is supported by the Norwegian government, among others, and carries out mine action programs in various regions of the world.
