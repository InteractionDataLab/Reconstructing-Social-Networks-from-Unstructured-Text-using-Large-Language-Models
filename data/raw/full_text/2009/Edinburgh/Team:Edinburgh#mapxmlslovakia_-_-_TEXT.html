<contacts> <dist> <distName>Slovakia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Slovak Republic signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 25 February 1999, becoming a State Party on 1 August 1999. The government regards implementation legislation as unnecessary and states that existing penal codes cover violations of the treaty.
Unexploded ordnance (UXO) from World War II is occasionally found in Slovakia. The media reported that in the first half of 2002, 97 pieces of UXO, mostly artillery shells and grenades, were found in different places in the Banska Bystica area of West Slovakia.
No casualties from UXO are reported by Slovakia in its Article 7 or Article 13 reports. According to a press account, on 2 May 2002, a nine-year-old boy died and his 12-year-old brother was seriously injured after they set off a UXO found close to their home in the village of Horka nad Vahom. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
