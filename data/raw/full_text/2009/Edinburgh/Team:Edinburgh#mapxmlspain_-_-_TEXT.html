<contacts> <dist> <distName>Spain</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Spain signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 19 January 1999, becoming a State Party on 1 July 1999. In the preceding years, Spain attended all the preparatory meetings of the Ottawa Process, but was not considered a strong supporter of the mine ban.
Production of antipersonnel mines ceased officially in May 1996, and the 1994 export moratorium was made indefinite in 1996. Spain was previously a producer of at least five types of antipersonnel mine, and also an exporter of mines. Spain imported mines from Italy. Spain reported in April 2001 that production facilities had either been decommissioned or converted to other uses. Spain last used antipersonnel mines in 1975, on the Moroccan border with its then-colony of Western Sahara.
In the UN Security Council in November 2003, Spain stressed that mine action must remain an international priority and be adequately funded. The Spanish representative said that during past years Spain had contributed €15 million (over $16 million) for training programs and assistance to mine victims, and provided demining teams to various countries.
