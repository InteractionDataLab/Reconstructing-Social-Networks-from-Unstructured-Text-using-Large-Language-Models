<contacts> <dist> <distName>Belgium</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Belgium signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 4 September 1998, becoming a State Party on 1 March 1999.
Production of antipersonnel mines ceased in 1990 and transfer was prohibited in 1993. In 1995, Belgium became the first country to enact national legislation banning antipersonnel mines. Stockpile destruction was completed in September 1997.
Belgium is not deeply affected by mines, however, following the two world conflicts of 1914-18 and 1940-45, the territory has been affected by mines and unexploded ordnance. The latter still require the intervention of specialists in 1999. In Belgium, mine clearance is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense. Within the armed forces, operations are carried out by SEDEE. This Service consists of around 97 deminers who perform approximately 3,000 interventions per year. Throughout the 1990s more than 200 tons of devices have been destroyed each year, including 260 tons in 1998.
In Belgium there is no need of mine risk education for the public. Mine awareness was carried out after the two World Wars but today mines are not considered a risk. Some mine awareness training is organized for the armed forces and for civilians who are going to be in a position to face dangers, e.g., journalists, diplomats. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
