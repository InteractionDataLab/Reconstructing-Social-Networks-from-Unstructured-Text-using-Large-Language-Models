In March 2004, Sweden appointed an ambassador for mines and small arms/light weapons. Ambassador Johan Nordenfelt’s task is to represent Sweden internationally and nationally on these issues and to coordinate relevant work within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Sweden reported in December 2003: “International humanitarian mine action is of high priority for the Swedish Government. In 2003, Sweden contributed over MSEK 102 [Million Swedish Kronor] to humanitarian mine action. Swedish assistance to humanitarian mine action is channeled mainly through the Swedish International Development Co-operation Agency (SIDA) to the United Nations and NGOs.”
Disbursement of mine action funds in 2003 totaled SEK102.9 million ($12,731,682), which represents a very large (45 percent) increase from 2002 (SEK71 million). Funding from SIDA was SEK95.6 million ($11,828,463) and from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was SEK7.3 million ($903,219) in 2003, distributed for mine action in 11 countries.
