<contacts> <dist> <distName>Latvia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Latvia is contaminated by explosive remnants of war (ERW) from World War II and military bases from the Soviet era. There is also a small residual problem with mines, but no known mined areas.
In 2007, one new ERW casualty was reported. An EOD expert was killed while attempting to neutralize a device in his privately held collection. In 2006, three civilians were injured by ERW in Latvia.
There is no casualty data collection mechanism in Latvia. Information is collected from media reports and Latvian Armed Forces personnel. There were at least eight civilian ERW casualties between 1999 and the end of 2007 (one killed, three injured and four unknown). ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
