<contacts> <dist> <distName>Central African Republic</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Mine Ban Policy The Central African Republic acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty on 8 November 2002 and became a State Party on 1 May 2003. Its initial Article 7 transparency report is due by 27 October 2003.
In May 2002, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Central African Republic has never produced or exported antipersonnel mines and has a very limited quantity of antipersonnel mines stockpiled for training purposes.
In October 2002, landmines mines were used for the first time in the Central African Republic. Rebels loyal to General Francois Bozize reportedly laid landmines when they invaded the capital of Bangui, in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow President Patasse. They subsequently seized power on 15 March 2003. In his letter to Landmine Monitor, General Bozize stated that his armed forces had never acquired or used antipersonnel or antivehicle landmines.
Most of the mines were reportedly laid on the road linking Bangui's northern and eastern suburbs, including Damala and Ndress. There was also concern that mines were laid in Damara, 80 kilometers northwest of Bangui.
In November 2002, the Army of the Central African Republic started mine clearance operations in Bangui. One press account reported that both antipersonnel and antivehicle mines were being cleared.
