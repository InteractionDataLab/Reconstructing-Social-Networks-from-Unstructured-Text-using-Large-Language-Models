Malaysia has not been a mine-affected country since the early 1990s following the political settlement with the communist insurgency in the northern border area with Thailand. As part of a special operations program “Operasi Bersih,” mine clearance operations along the border with Thailand were conducted from 1990 to 1991 and involved the Malaysian and Thai governments as well as the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). Approximately 15,000 antipersonnel mines were destroyed in the border states of Kedah, Perak and Kelantan. Lt. Col. Basri reported that the role of the CPM soldiers was to locate mines that they had laid and the role of the Thai soldiers was to destroy them. He also said the CPM used cows to demine and clear paths through government-mined area.
In March 2001, the Malaysian Army Field Engineering Institute established a Mines Awareness Center to teach Malaysian soldiers and peacekeepers of other nationalities about the Mine Ban Treaty and Malaysia’s implementation legislation.
