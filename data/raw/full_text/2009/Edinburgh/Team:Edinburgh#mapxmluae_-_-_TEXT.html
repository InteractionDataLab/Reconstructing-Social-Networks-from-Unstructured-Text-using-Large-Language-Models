<contacts> <dist> <distName>United Arab Emirates</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. In November 2007, a UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs official told the ICBL that the UAE plans to join the treaty in the near future, and expressed interest in engaging in dialogue with the ICBL regarding accession.[
The UAE has stated that it has not produced, used, or exported antipersonnel mines. While some officials have said that the UAE does not have a stockpile of antipersonnel mines, Landmine Monitor has received conflicting information from another governmental source.
In 2007, the UAE contributed US$600,000 (€437,605) to the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) for mine and cluster munition clearance in South Lebanon. In 2006, the UAE contributed $19,881,982 to the Operation Emirates Solidarity II (OES II) program for clearance of cluster munition strike sites in South Lebanon. Although OES II-funded programs continued in 2007, costs were covered by funds provided in previous years. The UAE contracted BACTEC and ArmorGroup directly in allocating the $19.9 million in funds; UNMAS did not administer OES II contributions.
In 2008, it was reported that the UAE land forces had purchased two MineWolf mine clearance machines. The intended use of the machines was not known.
