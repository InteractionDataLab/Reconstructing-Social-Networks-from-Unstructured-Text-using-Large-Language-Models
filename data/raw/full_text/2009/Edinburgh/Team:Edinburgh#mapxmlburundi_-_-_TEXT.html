<contacts> <dist> <distName>Burundi</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[ As of June 2008, Burundi remained contaminated with mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), the legacy of 13 years of internal conflict, but was close to freeing itself of contamination. Analysis of data from a 2005–2006 general survey and subsequent demining had indicated that mine contamination was minimal, with the total number of suspected hazardous areas (SHAs) reported to have been 238.
In April 2007, Burundi reported that 80% of the country had been cleared of mines and ERW.
There could have been at least eight new mine/ERW casualties in Burundi in 2007.
The United States Department of State reported that “There continued to be reports of deaths and injuries attributed to the use of grenades and mortars; however, unlike in the previous year, there were no deaths as a result of unexploded ordinance or landmines laid in previous years by government or rebel combatants.”
Casualties continued to occur in 2008 with at least four casualties, including two killed and two injured in two separate incidents. Of these DAHMI recorded two boys injured by ERW in Gitaramuka (Bujumbura Mairie province).  ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
