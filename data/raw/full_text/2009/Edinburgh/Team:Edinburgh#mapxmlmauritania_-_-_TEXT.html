<contacts> <dist> <distName>Mauritania</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Northern Mauritania is contaminated by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), mostly unexploded ordnance (UXO), the result of the conflict over Western Sahara in 1975–1978. Contamination includes (cluster) submunitions. A 2006 Landmine Impact Survey (LIS) found a total of 65 suspected hazardous areas (SHAs), covering 76km2 and affecting 60 communities, vastly reducing earlier estimates of contamination.
In 2007, the PNDHD reported three new mine casualties in three separate incidents in Mauritania, including one person killed and two injured. All casualties were civilian and were reported as having received mine/ERW risk education (RE). Two casualties were men (35 and 45 years old), including a nomad and a French tourist, and one was a 14-year-old child playing (gender unknown). Two casualties were caused by antipersonnel mines and one by an antivehicle mine.  In 2006, seven casualties were recorded (one person killed and six injured); two of these casualties were foreign tourists. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
