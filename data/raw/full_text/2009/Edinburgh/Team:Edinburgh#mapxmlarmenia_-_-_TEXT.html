<contacts> <dist> <distName>Armenia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[ Armenia is affected by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), resulting mainly from the conflict with Azerbaijan between 1988 and 1994 in which mines were laid by both sides. In 2005, the Armenia Landmine Impact Survey (LIS) identified 60 communities impacted by a total of 102 suspected hazardous areas.
Nagorno-Karabakh, territory recognized as part of Azerbaijan which was occupied by Armenian forces during the conflict between the two countries, is mine and ERW-affected. In April 2008, it was reported in the media that Armenia had agreed to provide minefield maps to Azerbaijan in the event of reaching a peace agreement on the territory with Azerbaijan.
In 2007, one civilian was injured in a landmine incident on 13 May in Ichevan, Tavush province. Casualties may well be under-reported as there is no systematic causality data collection. The number of casualties reported annually has been decreasing since 2004 when 15 casualties were reported.
The most common activities of civilian casualties at the time of the incident were farming, herding, collecting food and water, and playing.
In 2007 and 2008, mine risk topics were included in the Primary Military Preparedness course taught in the secondary school curriculum, rather than as a general health and safety issue. The subject focused on Armenia’s proximity to the frozen conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.  ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
