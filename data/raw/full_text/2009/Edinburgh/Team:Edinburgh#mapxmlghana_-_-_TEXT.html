<contacts> <dist> <distName>Ghana</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Ghana signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997, ratified on 30 June 2000, and the treaty entered into force on 1 December 2000. There is no national implementing legislation in place “yet.”
After fully participating in the Ottawa Process leading to the Mine Ban Treaty, Ghana has attended three annual Meetings of States Parties (in 1999, 2001, and 2002), as well as three intersessional Standing Committee meetings. Regionally, Ghana has participated in landmines seminars held in Burkina Faso (January 2004) and Mali (February 2001). Since 1996, Ghana has voted in favor of each annual pro-ban United Nations General Assembly resolution.
Ghana submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report, due on 31 May 2001, on 24 July 2002. Ghana reports that does not use, produce or stockpile antipersonnel mines (including for training), and it has never exported or transferred the weapon. Ghana has not provided an updated Article 7 report, due annually on 30 April.
Ghana has declared that it is not mine-affected. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
