There have been reports as far back as 2001 of scattered UXO at military training ranges at Archer’s Post.[13] While the original problem is said to have been addressed, as a British defense official explained in an email to Landmine Monitor, “the British army carries out clearance at the end of each of its live-firing exercises.” It also carries out an annual exercise, Exercise Pineapple, in which explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel spend up to a month clearing UXO that may have been left in Kenya. “This includes all UXO regardless of whichever armed force left them there. Where possible, the army work alongside Kenyan counterparts and we have assisted in training Kenyan soldiers in EOD.”  In 2007, one new ERW casualty was recorded: a 28-year-old man was killed in his home while manipulating a piece of UXO he had allegedly found at a former British Army training field in Laikipia district in March. The British Army was unaware of any incidents that had occurred on training fields it had used, but stated that, “All further credible reports of UXO injuries will be thoroughly investigated and compensated where negligence is proven.” Five men were killed in a fire at a Kenyan factory which might have been caused by artillery shells mistakenly loaded into the furnace, but the police would not confirm this was the cause of the fire.
