<contacts> <dist> <distName>Cameroon</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Cameroon signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997. Domestic procedures for ratification were completed on 28 July 2000, but the ratification instrument was never deposited. A new ratification law was adopted on 23 July 2002, and Cameroon deposited its instrument of ratification at the United Nations on 19 September 2002, becoming a State Party on 1 March 2003. National implementation legislation was reported in its Article 7 report, has not yet been adopted.
Cameroon has not produced, exported or used antipersonnel mines and will not facilitate their transit through its territory. It possesses a stockpile of 500 antipersonnel mines for training purposes, which will be destroyed once the mines are out of date.
Cameroon is not mine-affected, but some military are trained in demining techniques. The Mine Ban Treaty is part of the curriculum at the Military Academy in Yaoundé. Each year on 24 October, Cameroon commemorates a national who was killed in a mine incident in Cambodia during military operations with the UN Peacekeepers during the 1992-1993 UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
