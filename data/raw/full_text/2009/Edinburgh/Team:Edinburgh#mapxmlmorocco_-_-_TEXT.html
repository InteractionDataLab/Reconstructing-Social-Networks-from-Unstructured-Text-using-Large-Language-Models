<contacts> <dist> <distName>Morocco</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Morocco is not considered affected except for the territory it controls in Western Sahara, which is contaminated with antipersonnel and antivehicle mines, and explosive remnants of war (ERW). Morocco has mined the berms (earthen walls about 3m high) which it laid in the zone it controls in Western Sahara. It claims to monitor the mined areas and to have records of where the mines were laid. The exact extent of contamination has not been disclosed but according to Landmine Action, Western Sahara is one of the most heavily mined territories in the world. Morocco has declared it will clear all the mines as soon as the conflict is resolved. Following the death of a senior Moroccan dignitary due to a landmine, Morocco embarked on a major demining effort in January 2007.
At the Eighth Meeting of States Parties in November 2007, Morocco stated that three or four mine casualties occurred in 2007, but further detail was not provided.
