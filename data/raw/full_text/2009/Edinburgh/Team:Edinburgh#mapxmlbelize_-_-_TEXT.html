<contacts> <dist> <distName>Belize</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Belize signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 27 February 1998, ratified on 23 April 1998, and the treaty entered into force on 1 March 1999. No domestic implementation legislation has been established.
Belize did not attend any Mine Ban Treaty-related meetings in 2002 or 2003. On 22 November 2002, it voted in favor of UN General Assembly Resolution 57/74, urging universalization and implementation of the treaty.
Belize submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report on 4 November 1999, covering calendar year 1999, but has not submitted any subsequent reports.
Belize has never used, produced, imported, or stockpiled antipersonnel landmines, including for training purposes, and is not mine-affected.  ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
