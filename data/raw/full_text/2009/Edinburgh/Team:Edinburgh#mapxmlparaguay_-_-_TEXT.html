<contacts> <dist> <distName>Paraguay</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Paraguay signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997, ratified on 13 November 1998 and the treaty entered into force on 1 May 1999. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Law of Firearms, Munitions and Explosives—Law 1.910 adopted 1 May 2002—ensures strict domestic application and observance of all aspects of the Mine Ban Treaty.
Paraguay participated in the Ottawa Process, including the Oslo treaty negotiations in 1997, and has voted in support of every annual pro-ban UN General Assembly resolution since 1996. However, it has attended only two of the five annual Meetings of States Parties (in 1999 and 2002), and none of the intersessional Standing Committee meetings. Paraguay participated in a regional seminar on stockpile destruction in the Americas in Buenos Aires in November 2000.
In its Article 7 reports, Paraguay declares that it is not mine-affected, and that it does not possess any antipersonnel mines, including for training purposes. Paraguay is not believed to have ever produced, transferred or used antipersonnel mines.
