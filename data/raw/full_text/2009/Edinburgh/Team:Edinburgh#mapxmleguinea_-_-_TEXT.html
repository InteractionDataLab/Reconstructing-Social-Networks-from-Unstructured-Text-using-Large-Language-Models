<contacts> <dist> <distName>Equatorial Guinea</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Equatorial Guinea acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty on 16 September 1998, and the treaty entered into force on 1 March 1999. It has not enacted implementing legislation. In 2001, Equatorial Guinea indicated that it requires assistance in meeting this treaty obligation. Equatorial Guinea has not yet submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report, due on 28 August 1999. It attended the Fourth Meeting of States Parties in September 2002. Equatorial Guinea co-sponsored UN General Assembly Resolution 57/74 in November 2002 calling for the universalization and implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty, but was absent during the final vote.
In February 2001, a government representative told Landmine Monitor that Equatorial Guinea has never used, produced, or imported antipersonnel mines, and does not maintain a stockpile of landmines, even for training purposes. He also said that Equatorial Guinea is not mine-affected and has no mine victims.  ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
