   Name: Chris French
   Department: Biology
   Contact email: C.French

   My first degree is in Bioprocess Engineering, and my Ph.D. is in Microbial Biotechnology (specifically,    biotransformations of natural products for the chemical industry). I now lecture in general and applied    microbiology    and biotechnology in the School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh. My research is    mainly concerned with the development of microbial systems for industrial and environmental applications. I    have been supervising Edinburgh's IGEM entries since 2006. I think BioBricks are a great tool for the    development of new biological systems; my Ph.D. students are applying them to the development of biosensors    and systems for conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to useful products.
