<contacts> <dist> <distName>Uruguay</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Uruguay signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 but has not yet ratified. While ratification legislation was sent to the Congress on 4 September 1998, it was not passed before the change in government on 1 March 2000.
According to the Army, Uruguay has never produced or exported antipersonnel mines. It has imported AP mines from Belgium. It does not appear that Uruguay has used antipersonnel mines in combat operations or for border defense.
Uruguay is not mine-affected. There have been a few Uruguayan landmine casualties, mostly from military and peacekeeping operations. UID’s retired Captain Poladura lost his right leg while participating in mine clearance in Angola in June 1996
