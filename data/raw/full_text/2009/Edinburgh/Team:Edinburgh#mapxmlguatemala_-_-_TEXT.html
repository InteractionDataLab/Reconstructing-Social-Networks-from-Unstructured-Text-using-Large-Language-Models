<contacts> <dist> <distName>Guatemala</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Guatemala signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 26 March 1999, becoming a State Party on 1 September 1999.
Guatemala has reported that it never produced, imported, stockpiled or used antipersonnel mines, and that it has no antipersonnel mines for training or development purposes. No use of antipersonnel mines has been recorded since internal armed conflict concluded in December 1996.
At the Standing Committee meetings in May 2006, Guatemala declared that it had met its Article 5 obligations, having cleared all known antipersonnel mines from its territory. Guatemala’s contamination was a result of internal conflict that spanned 36 years, leaving a small number of mines and a larger quantity of explosive remnants of war (ERW), mostly unexploded ordnance (UXO). The only recorded minefield in the country was cleared in 1996 by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca), the UN and the Guatemalan Army, before Guatemala signed the Mine Ban Treaty. With the completion of its national demining plan in December 2005, Guatemala has no known mined or battle areas. Since then Guatemala has only received reports of ERW.
Landmine Monitor did not identify any new mine/ERW casualties in Guatemala in 2007 and through May 2008. The last reported ERW casualties occurred in 2005 (two people killed and seven injured) and no mine casualties have been reported since the December 1996 cease-fire.
