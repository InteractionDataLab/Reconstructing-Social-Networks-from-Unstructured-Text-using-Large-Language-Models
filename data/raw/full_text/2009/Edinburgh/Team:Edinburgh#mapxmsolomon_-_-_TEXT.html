<contacts> <dist> <distName>Solomon Islands</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Solomon Islands signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997 and ratified on 26 January 1999. It is not known if any national implementation legislation or measures are in place, as the Solomon Islands has not yet submitted its initial Article 7 transparency report, originally due by 27 December 1999. In May 2002, a representative from the Solomon Islands participated in the Mine Ban Treaty intersessional Standing Committee meetings in Geneva for the first time. He stated that the government was aware of its Article 7 reporting obligation, but internal difficulties had contributed to the delay.
He also confirmed that the Solomon Islands has never produced, transferred, or stockpiled antipersonnel mines. On 22 November 2002, the Solomon Islands voted in support of pro-ban UN General Assembly Resolution 57/74.
In June 2003, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs told Landmine Monitor, “World War II ordnance remains a problem not only on Guadalcanal, but other parts of the country as well.” ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
