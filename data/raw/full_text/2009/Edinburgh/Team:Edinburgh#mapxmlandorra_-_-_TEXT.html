At the treaty signing ceremony, the Minister of Foreign Relations pledged Andorra’s support for United Nations demining efforts, and lamented the failure of some countries to sign the treaty. Although Andorra did not participate it the Ottawa Process meetings, or the treaty negotiations, Andorra voted in favor of United Nations General Assembly resolutions supporting a ban on landmines in 1996, 1997, and 1998.
Andorra does not produce, trade, use, or stockpile antipersonnel landmines. Andorra is not mine affected ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
