Biology - The Cytotoxicity and Mutagenicity of TNT
The majority of TNT toxicity studies have been performed by Jehuda Yinon (1990) and have been described in his book Toxicity and Metabolism of Explosives. The studies were for the most part derived from observations of people working closely with TNT at weapons factories or cleanup operations. TNT was found to be cytotoxic and mildly mutagenic. The primary metabolites of TNT in the body are 4-amino-2, 6-dinitrotoluene and 2, 4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene. TNT along with its metabolites was found to be particularly cytotoxic after prolonged exposure. The most common symptoms of extended TNT exposure are anaemia and hepatotoxicity, as the chemical was found to affect the structure of haemoglobin and be lethal to hepatic cells. If ingested, TNT may cause cyanosis (darkening of the skin or lips due to extreme vasoconstriction), gastritis and, in large doses, toxic jaundice resulting in liver failure and death. 50% of workers exposed to TNT had thermoregulatory disorders, while 20% showed disorders of the nervous system; systolic murmur, bradycardia, systolic hypotension and myocardial dystrophy were also commonly reported. Finally, following TNT leaks into ponds and lakes, the concentration of 5mg/L was found to be lethal to fish, raising serious concerns about the environmental safety of the chemical.
