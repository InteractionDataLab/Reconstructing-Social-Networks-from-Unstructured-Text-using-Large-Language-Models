<contacts> <dist> <distName>Romania</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Romania signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 30 November 2000, becoming a State Party on 1 May 2001. Government Decision 1326 on implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty was published on 4 December 2002. This designates responsibilities for the ministries involved and establishes an Interdepartmental Working Group to coordinate implementation of the treaty.
The NGO Sibienii Pacifisti (People of Sibiu for Peace) organized monthly information seminars on landmines and issued appeals published in national media that mines should not be used in the conflict in Iraq. It also called on the government to obtain assurances from the US that any military equipment transferred through Romania would not include antipersonnel landmines. This appeal was published in a daily newspaper.
Romania is not mine affected. As part of its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Romania has deployed an engineering battalion with a demining unit. Romania has also participated in mine clearance efforts and donated medical equipment, including a radiological laboratory and a mobile medical unit, to Angola ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
