<contacts> <dist> <distName>Madagascar</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Madagascar signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 4 December 1997, ratified on 16 September 1999, and the treaty entered into force on 1 March 2000. In 2001, the government said national implementation legislation was unnecessary because the country did not “possess antipersonnel mines.” In May 2004, however, the Commander of the Armed Forces said there are “plans to draft one” in the future. A directive on treaty obligations has also been issued for the Armed Forces. The Ministry of National Defence is in charge of the landmine issue.
According to the report, Madagascar has not produced and does not possess antipersonnel landmines. An Army official has stated that Madagascar has a small number of inert practice mines (type AP Mle 35) for training purposes.
It appears Madagascar had a stock of mines in the past. In 1999, an official told Landmine Monitor that Madagascar had not imported any landmines since 1970. Landmines were reportedly used in 1991 as a deterrent to the opposition marches in the immediate vicinity of the presidential palace. Despite some allegations, Landmine Monitor could find no evidence that landmines were used in the 2002 crisis.
Madagascar is not considered mine-affected, although it has not made an official declaration to that effect to States Parties. There have been no reported landmine casualties.
In 2003, five soldiers participated in a demining training at the regional mine clearance training center for ECOWAS member states in Ouidah, Benin. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
