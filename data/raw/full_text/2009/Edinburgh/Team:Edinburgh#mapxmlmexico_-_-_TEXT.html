<contacts> <dist> <distName>Mexico</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Angel Gurria, signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997. As noted by the Foreign Relations Secretariat (SRE) Director General for the United Nations Minister Luis Alfonso De Alba, “Mexico has been one of the main promoters, along with Canada and other nations, of the Ottawa Convention.” Mexico was a member of the Core Group of nations which led the Ottawa Process. It was one of the first nations in the world to call for a total ban on antipersonnel landmines and has been a diplomatic leader on the landmine issue since the negotiations for the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW).
While Mexico is not mine-affected, and there are no known mine casualties in Mexico, according Minister Luis Alfonso De Alba, “Mexico was the main promoter of the initiative which ended with the signature of the ‘Memorandum of Understanding on a Joint-Program for Rehabilitation of Victims of Landmines in Central America,’ between Mexico, Canada and the Pan-American Health Organization” at the Regional Seminar on Antipersonnel Landmines in January 1999.
Mexico has not contributed to the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance, and is not known to have contributed bilaterally to mine clearance operations in affected nations.
