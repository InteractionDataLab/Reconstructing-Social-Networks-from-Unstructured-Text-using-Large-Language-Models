In Luxembourg, UXO clearance is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Forces. Clearance is carried out by the Demining Service, which responds to about 200 requests every year.
In 1998, the Luxembourg government gave approximately U.S. $600,000 to the UXO Lao Trust Fund. The majority of that grant is earmarked for the salaries of the Lao deminers in Savannaketh province. Luxembourg has contributed a total of $226,567 to the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Clearance. In 1997, Luxembourg contributed to victim assistance projects through a grant of 4,187,970 F.lux (U.S. $114,742) given to the ICRC.
