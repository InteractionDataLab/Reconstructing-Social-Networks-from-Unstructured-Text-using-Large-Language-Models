The Republic of Finland has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. It is the only European Union (EU) country that has not signed, ratified, or acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. In September 2004, Finland announced that it would join the Mine Ban Treaty in 2012, six years later than its previously stated goal, and would destroy its mine stockpiles by 2016.
Finland has declared that it “does not produce or export anti-personnel landmines and, during peacetime, anti-personnel mines are in stockpiles. There are no minefields in Finland.” Production of antipersonnel mines in Finland ceased in the early 1970s, and Finland has not acquired any antipersonnel mines since then. An EU Joint Action obliges Finland not to procure more antipersonnel mines.
Finland reported contributing €3,636,279 (US$4,985,702) to mine action in 2007, a decrease of approximately 27% compared to 2006. This represents the lowest level of funding by Finland since 2001, and the first time that annual funding has been less than €4 million.
Finland discontinued funding in 2007 to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Jordan, and Lebanon, all of which received funds in 2006. Funding levels to other recipient states and Somaliland remained approximately the same.
