<contacts> <dist> <distName>Slovenia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[CThe Republic of Slovenia signed the Mine Ban Treaty on 3 December 1997 and ratified it on 27 October 1998, becoming a State Party on 1 April 1999. Implementation legislation, including penal sanctions, was being considered in 2002.
All of Slovenia’s Article 7 reports claim that there are no areas suspected to contain antipersonnel mines. A report by the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe in October 2001 stated, “Slovenia no longer has a mine problem, however there still remains a problem associated with the disposal of UXO [unexploded ordnance] from previous conflicts.”
At the Fourth Meeting of States Parties in September 2002, the Slovenian representative told delegates that the Slovenian-based International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) is an efficient funding mechanism for mine clearance and other mine action.[19] In 2002, the government donated $362,534 to the ITF. In 2001, Slovenia contributed $418,373 to the ITF. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
