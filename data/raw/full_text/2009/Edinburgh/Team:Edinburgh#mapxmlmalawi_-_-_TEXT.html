<contacts> <dist> <distName>Malawi</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[Malawi was suspected of being contaminated by mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW), largely as a result of the Mozambican internal armed conflict that ended in 1992. In particular, it was feared that the area along the 1,000km border between Malawi and Mozambique was affected by mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). It was also suspected that former Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP) bases and former refugee camps elsewhere in the country might be contaminated. Finally, as Malawi suffers from flooding regularly, there were concerns that any existing mines might have moved during the floods, creating new contaminated areas.
No new mine/ERW casualties were reported in Malawi in 2007 and to May 2008. The last reported mine incidents occurred in 2003, when four children were injured in two separate landmine incidents.
The police and the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR), in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, collect mine/ERW casualty data: 192 casualties were identified. Some local and international organizations provide information on incidents and casualties.
Between May and December 2007, NPA identified 18 mine/ERW casualties during its survey of 205 locations along Malawi’s border with Mozambique. Seven people were killed by ERW and one by a landmine (three men, three children, two unknown). Nine people were injured by ERW and one by a landmine (four men, one child, and five unknown). These casualties occurred between 1992 and 2005. It is believed that 41 people were killed and approximately 1,000 were injured by landmines between 1986 and 2003, but the figure could be higher. ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
