Here are some of our pictures taken during our time spent on the iGEM project, and everybody will have no doubts that we had FUN! Moreover, our fan level is definitely higher than any other expected by an average iGEM judge :)
Unfortunately, our gallery flash object might not (but should) work with Firefox 3, but works perfectly with IE8 and Firefox 2. So, there's a fancy gallery for IE8/FF2 users and all the unlucky people who can't see the photos are welcome to visit our Facebook group to view them.
It takes some time for the photos to upload, but please be patient!
