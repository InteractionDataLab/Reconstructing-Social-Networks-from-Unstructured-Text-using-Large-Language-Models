<contacts> <dist> <distName>Estonia</distName> <textBox><![CDATA[The Republic of Estonia has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty. In July 2003, Estonian Prime Minister Juhan Parts stated, “Estonia strongly condemns the indiscriminate effects of anti-personnel landmines and supports an effective prohibition of these weapons.” He said, “I am pleased to confirm that Estonia is seriously considering joining the Ottawa Convention and has started the process of internal deliberations for joining the treaty.”
Estonia’s response to the annual questionnaire on landmines by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in December 2002 stated that it has not produced or exported, and does not possess, antipersonnel mines. Export and transit of antipersonnel mines have been banned since 1999. Explosives, including landmines, continue to be used in criminal activities in Estonia.
In October 2002, the government stated, “There are no special mine clearance programs in Estonia. Estonia is not a mine-affected country, but some old munitions left over from the World War II can be found in the ground.... In these areas, demining activities are carried out by the Estonian Defense Forces and/or Rescue Board.”
The Rescue Board reports that mine/UXO risk education is a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Since early 2001, it has produced a program to warn children in case they find UXO, which includes dissemination of mine risk education booklets and videos in schools.
In its fiscal year 2002, the United States provided Estonia with $254,000 for the purchase of explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and demining equipment. The US also provided $853,000 in FY 2001 and $998,000 in FY 2000 for demining assistance.
In 2002, Estonia contributed $2,000 to the UN Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action.
From July 2002 until January 2003, an explosives detection dog team (three dogs and five personnel) from the Rescue Board joined the peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan. A second team was deployed in early February 2003 for a six-month tour. Estonia has offered to support other US and NATO peacekeeping operations.
In 2002, one civilian was killed and seven others injured in UXO incidents. In 2001, nine people were injured, including a deminer, and three people were killed, including a deminer.
In October 2002, Estonia reported, “There are no special rehabilitation programs for persons injured by mines in Estonia. If incident(s) happen, the injured person(s) is treated in civilian hospitals with all available medical means and resources.” ]]></textBox> <email><![CDATA[]]></email> </dist>
