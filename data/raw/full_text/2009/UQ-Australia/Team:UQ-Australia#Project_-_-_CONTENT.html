P.syringae</B></SPAN></H1><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_Abstract"><B>Project Abstract</B></SPAN></H2><P>Microbes such as Escherichia coli and Cuprivadis metallidurans have an endogenous multicomponent mercury (Hg2+) uptake and reduction operon, under the control of a metal responsive transcription factor, MerR.  By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution. 
</P><P>
P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation. Optimal growth of P. syringae occurs at 22oC. By introducing five heat-shock genes, the tolerance range will be increased to better suit the Australian climate.  This modification has the potential to increase the availability of Australia’s most precious resource; water.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Bioaccumulation_.28Mercury.29_Project"><B>Bioaccumulation (Mercury) Project</B></SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_Outline"><B>Project Outline</B></SPAN></H3><P>Water contamination is a key environmental issue for many countries around the world, both developed and developing.  In Queensland, Australia we have a particular problem with Mercury (Hg2+) contamination of water supplies around the major mining town of Mt Isa, and also from Airforce bases. After searching through the iGEM projects from previous years,  the arsenic detection system inspired us.  As the UQ 09' team, we wish to take this idea one step further and completely remove the offending heavy metal from water systems.
</P><P>To do this we will be utilizing a strain of <I>Escherichia coli</I>, with their already established mercury uptake, reduction and efflux system and making a few modifications. One of our aims is to couple the detection of Mercury to the expression of a native bacterial protein, Antigen 43 (AG43).  This protein, when expressed, causes the bacteria to stick to one another. As the bacteria aggregate in clumps, they will fall to the bottom of the sample.  Our idea is for the bacteria to take up the mercury, activating  Ag43 expression, resulting in aggregation, and the Mercury-filled bacteria will fall to the bottom leaving clean water.
</P><P>There are a number of parts that we hope to add to the registry. The first is Ag43 as a protein coding sequence and the MerR promoter sequence.  We will also add the completed mercury uptake and aggregation system as an operon.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_Background"><B>Project Background</B></SPAN></H3><P>Many bacteria carry heavy metal resistance systems, either encoded on a plasmid or within their genome. For example, the bacterium <I>Cupriavidis metallidurans</I>, first isolated from a sludge tank contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, contains genes which encode for reistance systems to Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(IV), Hg(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) <A href="http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/full/189/20/7417?view=long&amp;pmid=17675385" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>. These systems commonly contain a metal transporter, a metal binding protein, a reduction mechanism, and a metal responsive promoter. In the case of Hg(II), the currently accepted general system is outlined below. <A href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T37-48GFVCN-1&amp;_user=331728&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000016898&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=331728&amp;md5=6382dc0a7b36b391d954a54651c2ff72" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A></P><P>This system facilitates the transportation of Hg(II) into the cell, where MerA acts a reductase, producing Hg(0), which then diffuses out of the cell. However, our project focuses on the accumulation of mercury within the cell, so many elements of this pathway are unsuitable for our purpose. We envisage a system of two plasmids, one containing mercury resistance genes (mer genes).
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:528px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Plasmid 1</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>This plasmid will allow for the transport of Hg(II) into the cell, where the protein metallothionien aids in intracellular accumulation. Once Hg(II) enters the cell, it activates MerR, a transcriptional regulator. When active, MerR will initiate the transcription of Antigen43 (Ag43).

This means all the information for suface targeting of the plasma membrane is contained within the protein. Since Ag43 is a native protein to E. Coli (specifically K12 strain), it must first be removed from the genome, then re-inserted as a plasmid so that its expression can be controlled. We were able to obtain a flu- E. coli strain, kindly donated by Associate Professor Mark Schembri from the University of Queensland. When two E. coli cells express Ag43, they aggregate together. Once enough of these cells aggregate, they will fall to the bottom of solution. This autoaggregation can be easily measured using a spectrophotometer.

The sequence supplied on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts site is not a true refelection of the physical DNA. The sequence was unable to be cut by BglII, XhoI or BamHI, which were predicted restriction sites from the sequence. It was cut by PstI, when the given sequence does not contain that site. This part does not fulfill the conventions of Standard 21, as it contains neither the correct suffix or prefix. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Ag43 was isolated from plasmid pKKJ143. However, because the intended vector BBa_I76101 did not conform to Standard 21, this part was taken no further. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Part BBa_J63010 contains the correct Standard 23 Biobrick suffix and prefix. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI> MerT and MerP were successfully isolated from plasmid pSUTp.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> After cloning into vector BBa_J63010, a fragment of the correct size (corressponding to MerT) was observed after digest with appropriate restriction enzymes.

That is, the scarcity of water hinders the production of crops and livestock, as well as forcing restrictions of daily water usage for households.  Team UQ Australia aims to solve this problem through the use of a bio-precipitation technique, thus increasing the availability of our most precious resource.
</P><P><I>Pseudomonas syringae</I> is a common bacterium, primarily found in colder climates (optimally at 22°C), and is well known for its biological ice nucleation properties, i.e. the formation of rain/snow.  This bacteria expresses an ice nucleation protein on its outer membrane (InaZ). InaZ acts as a scaffold for the formation of the ice crystals, this directly assists in the formation of clouds and speeds up the rain cycle. However, the bacteria are unable to survive in environmental temperatures above 28°C.  The ideal growing temperatures for syringae are 22°C - 26°C. By introducing heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, and GroES) through plasmid insertion, UQ Australia aims to increase the optimal growth temperature available to <I>P.syringae</I>, thereby allowing bio-precipitation to occur in warmer (and drought stricken) climates. Although syringae already has this proteins encoded within the genome, they are not expressed at levels similar to bacteria which grow at higher temperatures (Susin, <I>et al</I>, 2006). 
</P><P>The heat shock proteins form two systems. GroEL and GroES form one dimer which acts as a chaperon. Together these proteins assists in lowering the mis-folding of proteins. At higher temperatures proteins become unstable and mis-fold at a higher rate. 
</P><P>Ideally, UQ Australia will be contributing a number of parts to the registry.  Firstly, a plasmid with DnaK, DnaJ, as well as an upstream promoter will drive the expression of these two genes.  Secondly, an additional plasmid will carry the genes for GroEL and GroES, also complemented by an upstream promoter to drive gene expression.
</P><P><B>Method</B></P><P>After receiving the parts from Kristos we went through the process of transforming them into the bacteria. In order to insert two of the genes into the iGEM standards we have to perform mutagenesis. This process is detailed in the notebook. The basic concept is changing one base pair that doesn't affect the translated protein but removes a restriction site that would normally cut with the same enzyme that the standard restriction sites would. Once this was removed we performed PCR on each of the genes. After PCR each part was digested and ligated into the standard plasmid for iGEM standards 21 and 23. Unfortunately standard 21 was unavailable. There were issues 
</P><P>By taking measurements during the life cycle of <I>P. syringae</I> it should show a shift in the maximal growth peak. Over a 14 hour growth period absorbance readings were taken of the transformed bacteria. Singh <I>et al</I> performed this same experiment with syringae which grew optimally at lower temperatures. Image A shows the optical density of the bacteria population over their growth period. After an initial lag phase of 4 hours there were considerable differences in the absorbance readings. Absorbance readings or optical density can be directly correlated to the total population of bacteria. When bacteria grow and populate the sample the media will become more dense with bacteria. Thus you can compare the density to a blank sample. Distinct difference in the growth rate were evident. For our project we aim to change the maximum density reached and thus the total growth of the bacterial population. Growth measurement needs to be taken in the stationary phase as to get an accurate representation of bacteria that are dying as well as dividing and growing.
