UQ-Australia IGEM Team 2009
Hello from UQ-Australia!
The UQ-Australia team consists of 9 undergraduate students, aided by 4 supervisors. 2009 is our first year of involvement in iGEM. UQ-Australia aims to tackle two important global environmental issues, which are of special interest to Australia.
Project 1: Bioprecipitation
This project aims to optimise the ice-nucleating ability of P. syringae at elevated temperatures with the goal to induce precipitation. So, can bacteria help drought, by bringing on rain? Well, we're trying to find out!
Project 2: Biofiltration
This project aims to modify the mercury uptake, reduction and efflux system in E. coli to reduce mercury contamination in water supplies. If this project is successful, it is likely that a similar approach would be effective in mitigating other types of heavy metal contamination.
Check out our Project Section and Lab Notebook for more details on both projects. Also check out our Lab Safety page.
The Our Lab section has some photos of our very own iGEM lab. This lab has been set up with the assistance of our generous sponsors .
Thank you!
