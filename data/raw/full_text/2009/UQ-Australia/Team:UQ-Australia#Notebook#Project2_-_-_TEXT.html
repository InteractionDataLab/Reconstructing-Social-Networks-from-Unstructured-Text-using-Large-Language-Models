22/09/09 - Digestion of Miniprep (K - double mutant)
22/09/09 - Colony Pick
One colony was found for the EL transformation. This was picked and incubates at 37'C
21/09/09 - Nutrient Broth, Miniprep and Transformation
It was a busy day,
Nutrient Broth was made. 13g/L of Nutrient Broth were made (Total of 4L)
Miniprep (K - double mutant):
Transformation (K - single mutants):
18/09/09 - Mutagenesis for PXCK-K and PXCK-EL
We have done mutagenesis on two of the plasmids. Here is a quick overview on the process: CLICK HERE
15/09/09 - Transformation with PXCK-K and PXCK-EL
PXCK-K and PXCK-EL plasmids were transformed into electrocompetent E. coli and left overnight at 37C in ampicillin plates (PXCK-K) or chloramphenicol plates (PXCK-EL).
08/09/09 Our Primers have arrived today, this means we can start to put our four genes into the standard plasmids!
02/09/09 For the last couple of weeks we have been trying to design primers in order to put them into the iGEM standard plasmids. Since restriction sites are against us, we are using mutagenesis in order to bypass this problem. Primers were ordered TODAY!
19/08/09 Miniprep of bacterial cultures. For procedure click HERE . Plasmids were stored in -20'C freezer (FIONA).
18/08/09 Colonies were picked from transformed bacteria. Protocol can be found by clicking HERE .
14/08/09
Results from transformation 2
pxCK-EJ = 1 colony
pxCK-ES = 3 colonies
pxCK-EL = 27*4 colonies
pxCK-K = 53*4 colonies
Plates were sealed with parafilm and stored in the -4 fridge.
13/08/09 A second transformation was performed on the four plasmids. Procedure slightly changed, click HERE to see it.
11/08/09 No results were given from the transformation. Transformation will have to be repeated.
10/08/09 Transformation of our 4 plasmids took place. They were transformed into TOP10 bacteria. A colony check will be preformed tomorrow morning.
To see protocol, click HERE
7/08/09 Vectors were examined and we are planning for the best cloning strategy for the standard plasmids.
6/08/09 Plasmid solutions were left overnight and in the morning checked again with Nanodrop. No DNA was measured. Samples were put in the waterbath at 37 degrees and left for a couple of hours. If Nanodrop does not work after the waterbath we will still do transformation since we only need few plasmids for the transformation to work. Nanodrop may not have been able to quantify such a small concentration of plasmids.
LB media was poured on petri dishes and plasmid DNA was checked again using Nanodrop.
pXCK-EL = 10.55 ng/uL
pXCK-ES = 8.43 ng/uL
pXCK-K = 11.73 ng/uL
pXCK-E/J = 2.66 ng/uL
Plasmids were stored and transformation will be done on Monday.
5/08/09
Plasmids have arrived!
pXCK-E/J
pXCK-K
pXCK-EL
pXCK-ES
We have put them into 150 mL of TE buffer and left overnight for the paper to dissolve and later extract the plasmid from the solution.
A Nanodrop was used to see if the DNA was coming out of the paper. No DNA was detected, thus samples were left overnight.
