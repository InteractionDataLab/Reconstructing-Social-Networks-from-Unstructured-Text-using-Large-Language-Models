Experiment 2
Transformation of pSUTp. pG.pmt and pSUTp
The bacteria used for this transformation reaction was DH5α Max efficiency cells strain (chemical competent) pSUTp. pG. pmt  and pSUTp solution collected from 02/10/09 (click HERE fore further details)                            (Can you please put the link to 02/10.09 nanodrop result here?) were diluted to 10ng/uL solution to use for the transformation reaction.
Transformation control: pUC19
Click HERE for detailed protocol of transformation reaction.
While bacteria containing pSUTp.pG.pmt and pUC 19 were cultured on two separate Amp plates, bacteria with pSUTp was grown on Kan plate.
Incubate went overnight at 370C.
Results: Bacteria colonies were shown on plate in following morning
08/10/09: Pick isolate colonies from pSUTp and pSUTp.pG.pmt cultures.
Click HERE for detailed protocol of picking colonies.
4 colonies from pSUTp culture were picked and transfered into new tubes named pSUTp  Kan 1-4
4 colonies from pSUTp.pG.pmt were picked and transferred into new tubes named  pSUTp.pG.pmt Amp 1-4
NOTE: MerT and MerP primers arrived.
