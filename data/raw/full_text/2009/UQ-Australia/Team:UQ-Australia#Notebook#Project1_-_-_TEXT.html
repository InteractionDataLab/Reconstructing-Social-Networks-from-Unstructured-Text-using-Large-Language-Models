15/09/09 - Repeat Transformation of BBaI716101
The overnight transformation from 14/09/09 was unsuccessful as no growth was observed on plates. It is probable that the cell death plasmid component (Part BBa_P1010) is functioning normally as it was believed that this component was 'faulty'. The same protocol as on 14/09/09 was used for the transformation with an extra positive control for comparison. A well characterised plasmid PUC18 (ampicillin resistance) was used as the positive control.
14/09/09 - Transformation of Plate 1, Well C
PLasmid BBa_I716101 with Part BBa_P1010 was transformed into XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent cells via heat shock and left in ampicillin plates at 37C overnight. DNA from plate 1, well C was stored in the Green iGEM box ('Fiona').
02/09/09 - Running Gel for Standard 23
2 gels were set up: - A--->1%, 140mL gel.Undigested and digested controls. Undigested/digested plasmid BBa_J63010 (Sample A, B and C) - B--->1%, 80mL gel. Undigested and Digested BBa_J63010 (Sample D,E)
01/09/09   - Agarose Gel and Nanodrop
Miniprepped BBa_J63010 plasmids ran on 1% Agarose gel (TAE buffer, pH8.5) at 200V, 70mA for 1hour. Post-stain: Ethidium Bromide. Click HERE for a picture of the gel. Lanes1,8 - empty, Lane2 - ladder, Lanes3-7 - Miniprepped DNA (colonies A-E)
Miniprepped BBa_J63010 plasmids (tubes A to E) analysed on nanodrop. (Data printout in IGEM_Mercury notebook)
New space created for BBa_J63010 tubes A to E: in "Fiona" freezer, UQ-Australia IGEM Team's Green box.
In the afternoon, digests of samples BBa_J63010 A-E (Standard 23) were run with EcoRI, AgeI, SpeI and PstI enzymes. Unfortunately NgoMIV enzymes were not in stock in the freezer so this digest could not be performed.
The Standard 21 plasmid BBa_I716101 was again digested with PstI. All samples were left in the 37 degrees water bath overnight.
28/08/09   - DNA miniprep
Mini prep DNA extractions performed for BBa_J63010 plasmid selected yesterday and incubated overnight.
Tubes stored in "Fiona" freezer, UQ-Australia IGEM Team's orange box.
EDIT (01/09/09): these tubes now in IGEMGreen Box ("Fiona" freezer, bottom shelf).
27/08/09   - Colony Picking
5 colonies were picked and grown in ?mL of LB Broth and were left in the 37C incubator overnight. Samples were labelled 'BBa_J63010 A,B,C,D,E'
26/08/09   - Transformation of Plasmid BBa_J63010 with part BBa_J04450
BBa_J04450 was found in plate 1, well C. Colonies were grown overnight and will be picked and grown tomorrow.
--->Digest Gel of BBa_I716101 with pGfa2cLac2 control
A 1% agarose gel was run with 1kb ladder and samples with EcoRI, XhoI, BglII and BamHI restriction enzymes. The gel visualisation (image here) indicates that only EcoRI was able to slice the plasmid; it is possible that the other restriction sites are not on the plasmid.
25/08/09   - In-gel Extraction and Overnight Digests
20 chloroamphenicol plates were prepared with LB agar. BBa_I716101 and control plasmid pGfa2cLac2 were each digested with EcoRI, XhoI, BglII and BamHI enzymes (total of 8 samples). Digests have been left to run overnight in the 37C waterbath.
24/07/09   - DNA extraction and electrophoresis
Mini prep DNA extractions performed for MS427-pBAD, MS427-pKKJ143 cultures incubated overnight.
