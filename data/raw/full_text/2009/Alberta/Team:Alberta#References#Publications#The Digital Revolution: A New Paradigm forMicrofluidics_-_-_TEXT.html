Team:Alberta/References/Publications/The Digital Revolution: A New Paradigm forMicrofluidics
From 2009.igem.org

Abstract: The digital revolution has come to microfluidics. In digital microfluidics(DMF), discrete droplets are manipulated by applying electrical fields to an array of electrodes. In contrast to microchannels, in DMF each sample and reagent is individually addressable, which facilitates exquisite control over chemical reactions. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in DMF, with a discussion of device formats, actuation physics, and biological and nonbiological applications. Along the way, we identify the key players in the field, and speculate on the advances and challenges that lie ahead. As with other fronts in the digital revolution, there have been and will be unexpected developments as DMF matures, but we posit that the future is bright for this promising technology.
