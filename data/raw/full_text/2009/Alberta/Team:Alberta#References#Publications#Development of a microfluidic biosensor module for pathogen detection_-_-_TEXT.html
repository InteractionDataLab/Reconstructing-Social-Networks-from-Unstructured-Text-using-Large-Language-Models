Abstract: The development of a microfluidic biosensor module with fluorescence detection for the identification of pathogenic organisms and viruses is presented in this article. The microfluidic biosensor consists of a network of microchannels fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The microchannels are sealed with a glass substrate and packed in a Plexiglas housing to provide connection to the macro-world and ensure leakage-free flow operation. Reversible sealing permits easy disassembly for cleaning and replacing the microfluidic channels. The fluidic flow is generated by an applied positive pressure gradient, and the module can be operated under continuous solution flow of up to 80 µL min–1. The biosensor recognition principle is based on DNA/RNA hybridization and liposome signal amplification. Superparamagnetic beads are incorporated into the system as a mobile solid support and are an essential part of the analysis scheme. In this study, the design, fabrication and the optimization of concentrations and amounts of the different biosensor components are carried out. The total time required for an assay is only 15 min including sample incubation time. The biosensor module is designed so that it can be easily integrated with a micro total analysis system, which will combine sample preparation and detection steps onto a single chip.
