Abstract: Luria-Bertani broth supports Escherichia coli growth to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 7. Surprisingly, however, steady-state growth ceases at an OD600 of 0.3, when the growth rate slows down and cell mass decreases. Growth stops for lack of a utilizable carbon source. The carbon sources for E. coli in Luria-Bertani broth are catabolizable amino acids, not sugars.
