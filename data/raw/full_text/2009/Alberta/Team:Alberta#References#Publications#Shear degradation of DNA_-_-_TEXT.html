Abstract: A concentric-cylinder flow-birefringence instrument is used to generate sufficient shear fields to break T2 DNA (M = 1.2 X 10(8)) and E. coli DNA (M = 2.5 X 10(9)) in dilute solution. Breakage is monitored in situ by measuring the change in birefringence relaxation after the flow has been stopped. The breakage of T2 DNA follows first-order kinetics. Rate constants are obtained as functions of shear rate and viscosity (varied by adding glycerol). The data are fitted by a modified Arrhenius equation, assuming that stess increases the rate by lowering the activation energy. The rate increases with temperature, pH, and water concentration, and appears to be a base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the phosphate-ester linkage. La3+ ions catalyze the reaction. E. coli DNA was reduced to half molecules at a shear stress of 0.4 dynes/cm2, which is about 2500 times less than that required for T2. The difference in rates is accounted for in part by the difference in size of the two, but may also reflect the presence of many single-strand nicks in the coli DNA.
