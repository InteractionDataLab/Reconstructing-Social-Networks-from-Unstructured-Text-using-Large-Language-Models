Annealing Anchor and Terminator Bytes
Instructions on how to anneal the complementary strands to obtain the same concentrations we used in our experiments (10μM).
What you will need:
Anchor oligos (complementary)
Terminator oligos (complementary)
Procedure:
To make a 10 μM Anchor solution with an A(B) overhang one must anneal Anchor_A(Anchor_B) and Anchor_Comp. To make a 10 μM Terminator solution with an A(B) overhang one must anneal Term_A(Term_B) and Term_Comp.
Combine 10 μL of Anchor/Term_(A or B) and Anchor/Term_Comp 100 μM stock solutions into an eppendorf tube.
Add 80 μL water or TE, mix.
Heat solution to 95C for 2 minutes.
Let cool to room temperature slowly.
