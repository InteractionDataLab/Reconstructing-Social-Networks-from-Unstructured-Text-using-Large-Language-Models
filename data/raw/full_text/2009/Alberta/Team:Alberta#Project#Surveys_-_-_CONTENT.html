A brief survey was given after the HYRS and Archbishop MacDonald presentations. Complete results from the HYRS presentation can be found <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Image:Uofa_Hyrs_feedback.pdf">here</A>. The survey handed out at Archbishop Macdonald High School is available <A href="UofA2009iGEM_Presentation+Feedback+Form.pdf‎">here.</A> Below is a summary of responses including representative quotes from students. <P><B>HYRS presentation feedback:</B></P><P><B>Had you ever heard of synthetic biology before our presentation? </B></P><P>
Yes: 22% </P><P>
No: 67% </P><P>
Sort of: 11% </P><B>Do you think it’s useful for high school students to know about synthetic biology and/or iGEM? Why? </B><P>
Yes: 100% </P><P>
“so that they know the field exists, and to see if it sparks any interest in them” </P><P>
“because it opens up different career paths.”</P><P>
“I believe it is useful because it allows students to broaden their perspectives on science and to address ethical issues.” </P><B>Does hearing about synthetic biology make you more interested in pursing a career in synthetic biology or another field of science and technology? </B><P>
Yes: 29% </P><P>
No: 18% </P><P>
Don’t know: 53% </P><B>What was the most important thing you learned from our pamphlet/presentation? Did anything really surprise you? </B><P>
&quot;That there is a program where undergrad students can do “real” science&quot; </P><P>
“The fact that this field exists at all” </P><P>
“that there's a lot more to <I>E. coli</I> than it being bacteria that makes you sick.“ </P><B>How could synthetic biology and our project be more effectively communicated to high school students? Was anything really confusing? </B><P>
“Nothing was confusing, presentation at school at bio class” </P><P>
“The presentation was very well presented. I believe that synthetic bio should be a much larger part of what is taught in the classroom” </P><P>
“Explaining it in application terms, how it applies to the students in everyday life” </P><P>
“smaller words/more definitions” </P><B>Archbishop Macdonald High School presentation feedback:</B><P><B>Had you ever heard of synthetic biology before our presentation? If so, did our presentation change your perception of synthetic biology? </B></P><P>
Yes: 17% </P><P>
No: 74% </P><P>
Sort of: 9% </P><P>
&quot;Yes I have heard of synthetic biology but I find it much more interesting now that I have seen the presentation.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;No, I have not heard about synthetic biology. Yes, it did change my perception with an in-depth definition of it.&quot;</P><B>What was the most important thing you learned from our presentation? Did anything really surprise you? </B><P>
&quot;The most important thing I learned was what synthetic biology is. Other things are ways of combining DNA genes. Yes, what surprised me was the props used and the amount of time these processes take.&quot;</P><P>
“I was surprised to learn how advanced you are at combining genes (with the magnet, etc.).” </P><P>
“The use of <I>E. coli</I> was rather interesting and a genuine surprise.”</P><B>Do you think it’s useful for high school students to know about synthetic biology and/or iGEM? Why? </B><P>
Yes: 100% </P><P>
&quot;Yes, it is useful because it allows students to learn about synthetic biology, and gives a hands-on experience/intro. Also, it allows H.S. students to consider a future in it.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;Yes – like you had said – the technologies created will be able to make lab kits, &amp; it’s interesting to see what post-secondary options are available.&quot;</P><B>How could synthetic biology and our project be more effectively communicated to high school students? Was anything really confusing? </B><P>
&quot;All of the little experiments and examples really helped portray what you were trying to say.
I thought that it was explained really well. I really liked involving us and showing us the different things that you used.&quot; </P><P>
“The job was done really well. I wasn’t confused in the slightest.” </P><P>
“It was actually fairly easy to follow along. The hands-on parts were effective.“ </P><B>Does hearing about synthetic biology make you more interested in pursuing a career in synthetic biology or another field of science and technology? Being part of an iGEM team? Why? </B><P>
Yes: 38%</P><P>
Maybe: 4%</P><P>
No: 58%</P><P> 
“Surprisingly, yes. I can definitely see merit in it as a field of study.” </P><P>
“Yes, synthetic biology seems like an interesting field of science. Working in a lab and with other students such as iGEM would be a good experience.” </P><P>
“I’m not sure if it would be the right field for me but it seems very interesting. I may think of pursuing or further exploring what it is about because the topics and reasoning behind it sound interesting and like it could help people.” </P><B>How do you feel about the potential usage of a ‘Biobytes Chromosome Assembly Kit’ in a high school laboratory?</B><P>
&quot;I think it would be a really cool thing to have in the lab because labs I find I learn the most from and if there was more labs I think bio would be a little easier.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;Very exciting because we will be working with real chromosomes and DNA!&quot;</P><P>
&quot;GREAT! It’s an awesome idea that I would be excited for as a new hands-on approach to labs.&quot;</P><B>What would you like to create with synthetic biology?</B><P>
&quot;Human organs would be beneficial.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;Bacteria that can eat plastic.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;Bacteria that targets metastatic cancer.&quot;</P><P>
&quot;Food.&quot;</P></FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
