Abstract: The replicon of the low copy number plasmid pSC101 has an obligatory requirement for the dnaA initiator protein of Escherichia coli as well as a plasmid-encoded initiator protein. We have identified the cistron of the plasmid-encoded initiator by DNA sequence analysis. Fusion of the initiator cistron with the lacZ gene of E. coli yielded a fusion protein of approximately equal to 150 kilodaltons, thus confirming that the open reading frame detected by DNA sequence analysis actually encoded a 37.5-kilodalton protein. Deletion of 26 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of the plasmid initiator abolished autonomous replication from pSC101 origin. By in vitro deletion analysis we have shown that, although sequences downstream from the initiator cistron are dispensable, a maximum of 400 base pairs immediately upstream from the NH2-terminal region of the initiator is necessary for plasmid replication. These upstream sequences contain an A + T-rich region and three tandem repeats of a 21-base pair sequence; these features are characteristics of other replication origins.
