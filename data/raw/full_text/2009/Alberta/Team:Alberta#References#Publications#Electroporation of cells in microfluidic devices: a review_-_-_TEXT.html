Abstract: In recent years, several publications on microfluidic devices have focused on the process of electroporation, which results in the poration of the biological cell membrane. The devices involved are designed for cell analysis, transfection or pasteurization. The high electric field strengths needed are induced by placing the electrodes in close proximity or by creating a constriction between the electrodes, which focuses the electric field. Detection is usually achieved through fluorescent labeling or by measuring impedance. So far, most of these devices have only concerned themselves solely with the electroporation process, but integration with separation and detection processes is expected in the near future. In particular, single-cell content analysis is expected to add further value to the concept of the microfluidic chip. Furthermore, if advanced pulse schemes are employed, such microdevices can also enhance research into intracellular electroporation.
