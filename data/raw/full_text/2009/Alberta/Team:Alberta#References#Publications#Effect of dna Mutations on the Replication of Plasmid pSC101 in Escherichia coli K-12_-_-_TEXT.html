Abstract: Escherichia coli strains with mutations in genes dnaB, dnaC, and dnaG were tested for their capacity to replicate pSC101 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at a nonpermissive temperature. Only a small amount of radioactive thymine was incorporated into pSC101 DNA in the dna mutants at 42 degrees C, whereas active incorporation into plasmid DNA took place in wild-type strains under the same conditions. The effects of the dnaB and dnaC mutations were greater on plasmid DNA synthesis than on host chromosomal DNA synthesis, suggesting that these gene products are directly involved in the process of pSC101 DNA replication. In dnaG mutants, both plasmid and chromosomal DNA synthesis were blocked soon after the shift to high temperature; although the extent of inhibition of the plasmid DNA synthesis was greater during the early period of temperature shift to 42 degrees C as compared with that of the host DNA synthesis, during the later period it was less. It was found that the number of copies of pSC101 per chromosome in dnaA and dnaC strains, grown at 30 degrees C, was considerably lower than that in wildtype strains, suggesting that the replication of pSC101 in these mutant strains was partially suppressed even under the permissive conditions. No correlation was found between the number of plasmid copies and the tetracycline resistance level of the host bacterium.
