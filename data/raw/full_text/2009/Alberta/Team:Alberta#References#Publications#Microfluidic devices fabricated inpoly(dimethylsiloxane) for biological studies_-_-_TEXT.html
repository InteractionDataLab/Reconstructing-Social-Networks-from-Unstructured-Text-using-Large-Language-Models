Abstract: This review describes microfluidic systems in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) for biological studies. Properties of PDMS that make it a suitable platform for miniaturized biological studies, techniques for fabricating PDMS microstructures, and methods for controlling fluid flow in microchannels are discussed. Biological procedures that have been miniaturized into PDMS-based microdevices include immunoassays, separation of proteins and DNA, sorting and manipulation of cells, studies of cells in microchannels exposed to laminar flows of fluids, and large-scale, combinatorial screening. The review emphasizes the advantages of miniaturization for biological analysis, such as efficiency of the device and special insights into cell biology.
