Abstract: The majority of gene therapy clinical trials use plasmid DNA that is susceptible to shear-induced degradation. Many processing steps in the extraction, purification, and preparation of plasmid-based therapeutics can impart significant shear stress that can fracture the phosphodiester backbone of polynucleotides, and reduce biological activity. Much of the mechanistic work on shear degradation of DNA was conducted over 30 years ago, and we rely heavily on this early work in an attempt to explain the empirical observations of more recent investigations concerning the aerosolization of plasmids. Unfortunately, the sporadic reports of shear degradation in the literature use different experimental systems, making it difficult to quantitatively compare results and reach definitive mechanistic conclusions. In this review, we describe the forces imparted to DNA during shear stress, and use published data to quantitatively evaluate their relative effects. In addition, we discuss the effects of molecular weight, strain rate, particle size, flexibility, ionic strength, gas–liquid interfaces, and turbulence on the fluid flow degradation of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Finally, we speculate on computational methods that might allow degradation rates in different experimental systems to be predicted.
