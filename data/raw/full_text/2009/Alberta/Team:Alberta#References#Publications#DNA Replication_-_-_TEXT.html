Abstract: DNA replication is crucial to life: in the duplication of the genome, in its rearrangements, and in its repair when damaged. The maturity of research on replication is attested to by monographs (1, 2), reviews (3), and symposia (4). Yet, many interesting and accessible questions remain unanswered. What we know and would like to know will be discussed under: how a DNA chain is started and extended, and how chromosomes are initiated, terminated, and segregated.
