Survey Results
A brief survey was given after the HYRS and Archbishop MacDonald presentations. Complete results from the HYRS presentation can be found here . The survey handed out at Archbishop Macdonald High School is available here. Below is a summary of responses including representative quotes from students.
HYRS presentation feedback:
Had you ever heard of synthetic biology before our presentation?
Yes: 22%
No: 67%
Sort of: 11%
Do you think it’s useful for high school students to know about synthetic biology and/or iGEM? Why?
Yes: 100%
“so that they know the field exists, and to see if it sparks any interest in them”
“because it opens up different career paths.”
“I believe it is useful because it allows students to broaden their perspectives on science and to address ethical issues.”
Does hearing about synthetic biology make you more interested in pursing a career in synthetic biology or another field of science and technology?
Yes: 29%
No: 18%
Don’t know: 53%
What was the most important thing you learned from our pamphlet/presentation? Did anything really surprise you?
"That there is a program where undergrad students can do “real” science"
“The fact that this field exists at all”
“that there's a lot more to E. coli than it being bacteria that makes you sick.“
How could synthetic biology and our project be more effectively communicated to high school students? Was anything really confusing?
“Nothing was confusing, presentation at school at bio class”
“The presentation was very well presented. I believe that synthetic bio should be a much larger part of what is taught in the classroom”
“Explaining it in application terms, how it applies to the students in everyday life”
“smaller words/more definitions”
Archbishop Macdonald High School presentation feedback:
Had you ever heard of synthetic biology before our presentation? If so, did our presentation change your perception of synthetic biology?
Yes: 17%
No: 74%
Sort of: 9%
"Yes I have heard of synthetic biology but I find it much more interesting now that I have seen the presentation."
"No, I have not heard about synthetic biology. Yes, it did change my perception with an in-depth definition of it."
What was the most important thing you learned from our presentation? Did anything really surprise you?
"The most important thing I learned was what synthetic biology is. Other things are ways of combining DNA genes. Yes, what surprised me was the props used and the amount of time these processes take."
“I was surprised to learn how advanced you are at combining genes (with the magnet, etc.).”
“The use of E. coli was rather interesting and a genuine surprise.”
Do you think it’s useful for high school students to know about synthetic biology and/or iGEM? Why?
Yes: 100%
"Yes, it is useful because it allows students to learn about synthetic biology, and gives a hands-on experience/intro. Also, it allows H.S. students to consider a future in it."
"Yes – like you had said – the technologies created will be able to make lab kits, & it’s interesting to see what post-secondary options are available."
How could synthetic biology and our project be more effectively communicated to high school students? Was anything really confusing?
"All of the little experiments and examples really helped portray what you were trying to say. I thought that it was explained really well. I really liked involving us and showing us the different things that you used."
“The job was done really well. I wasn’t confused in the slightest.”
“It was actually fairly easy to follow along. The hands-on parts were effective.“
Does hearing about synthetic biology make you more interested in pursuing a career in synthetic biology or another field of science and technology? Being part of an iGEM team? Why?
Yes: 38%
Maybe: 4%
No: 58%
“Surprisingly, yes. I can definitely see merit in it as a field of study.”
“Yes, synthetic biology seems like an interesting field of science. Working in a lab and with other students such as iGEM would be a good experience.”
“I’m not sure if it would be the right field for me but it seems very interesting. I may think of pursuing or further exploring what it is about because the topics and reasoning behind it sound interesting and like it could help people.”
How do you feel about the potential usage of a ‘Biobytes Chromosome Assembly Kit’ in a high school laboratory?
"I think it would be a really cool thing to have in the lab because labs I find I learn the most from and if there was more labs I think bio would be a little easier."
"Very exciting because we will be working with real chromosomes and DNA!"
"GREAT! It’s an awesome idea that I would be excited for as a new hands-on approach to labs."
What would you like to create with synthetic biology?
"Human organs would be beneficial."
"Bacteria that can eat plastic."
"Bacteria that targets metastatic cancer."
"Food."
