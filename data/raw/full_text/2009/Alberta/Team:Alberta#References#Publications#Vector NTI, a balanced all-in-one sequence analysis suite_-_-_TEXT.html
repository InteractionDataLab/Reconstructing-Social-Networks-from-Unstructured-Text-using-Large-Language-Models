Abstract: Vector NTI is a well-balanced desktop application integrated for molecular sequence analysis and biological data management. It has a centralised database and five application modules: Vector NTI, AlignX, BioAnnotator, ContigExpress and GenomBench. In this review, the features and functions available in this software are examined. These include database management, primer design, virtual cloning, alignments, sequence assembly, 3D molecular viewer and internet tools. Some problems encountered when using this software are also discussed. It is hoped that this review will introduce this software to more molecular biologists so they can make better-informed decisions when choosing computational tools to facilitate their everyday laboratory work. This tool can save time and enhance analysis but it requires some learning on the user’s part and there are some issues that need to be addressed by the developer.
