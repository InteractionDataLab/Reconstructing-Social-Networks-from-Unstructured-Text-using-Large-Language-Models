As described in the modeling section of this wiki, the metabolic genes from this preliminary list were used as a starting point for the computer model and were greatly altered based on the model's suggestions.  The following criteria were used for selecting genes from a literature source:

<UL><LI>Genes must be present in more than one literature list unless there is particular reason to suspect they are essential.</LI><LI>The BioBytes metabolism is modeled after the minimal metabolism proposed by Gil et al 04, with the addition of cell wall, fatty acid, heme and ubiquitin synthesis, as Gil assumed these would not be necessary in a mycoplasma like minimal cell.</LI><LI>Additional genes required for metabolism were selected based on pathway information in the Ecocyc database. Redundancy of pathways is likely why these genes don’t appear essential in Baba, Gerdes and PEC.</LI><LI>Antitoxin genes are not essential as toxin genes would not be present.</LI></UL></P><P> The basic functional groups of genes which were selected can be seen in the next chart and a detailed list of processes which were included follow.</P><P><B>Essential Gene Functions</B></P><H3>Genes for the following processes were included:</H3><UL><LI>DNA replication and cell division, but no DNA repair</LI><LI>Chaperones, but no heat shock or membrane stress response system</LI><LI>Transcription</LI><LI>Translation</LI><LI>Glycolysis</LI><LI>PMF generation via an ATP synthase consuming ATP to export protons.</LI><LI>Synthesis of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate</LI><LI>Fatty acid synthesis</LI><LI>Methylerithritol pathway (for undecaprenyl phosphate and a ubiquinone side chain)</LI><LI>Synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, but no other phospholipids</LI><LI>Pentose phosphate pathway (converts 6 or 3 carbon sugars to 5C sugars, such as ones needed in nucleotide biosynthesis)</LI><LI>Lipoprotein synthesis (Int and lolB are lipoproteins and essential)</LI><LI>Synthesis of nucleotides (deoxy and oxy) from nucleosides</LI><LI>Attaching lipid and biotin groups to protein</LI><LI>Transport:</LI><UL><LI>PTC transport system (imports and phosphorylates glucose)</LI><LI>Inorganic phosphate transport</LI><LI>Nucleoside transport</LI><LI>Sec system (exports proteins to periplasm), including SRP for cotranslational membrane insertion. secB chaperone does not appear essential.

From the lists determined by the model there are 116 genes where were determined to be essential.  The model only contains metabolic genes of the MG1655 ''E. coli'' genome therefore all other types of genes were solely determined using literature sources.  Many of the genes that were determined to be essential are due to the complex nature of metabolic pathways.  It is not sufficient to simply delete a single gene and determine if the organism is viable.  Often genes act in complexes, or become essential if other genes become deleted (for example in redundant processes where 2 genes fulfill the same essential function) allowing the modeling work to fill the gaps of numerous genes which are required for life.  The function of many genes which were added include transport of small metabolic compounds.  Although there are some new pathways that are added, the majority of the genes collected add to many of the pathways determined to be essential via the literature search.  This shows that our list contained many of the correct pathways, just further research was required to determine all of the essential genes.</P><DIV class="Outreach"><DIV style="height: 400; background:#FFFFFF; colorou line-height:100% padding: 3px 0px;"><H1>BioBytes Final Essential Gene List</H1><DIV align="justify"><FONT size="2"><B>A final list of essential genes was produced from the literature review and the computer model. </B></FONT></DIV><P>Number of genes in list created from literature: 332 </P><P>Number of additional genes suggested by model: 116 </P><P>Number of genes in final essential genes list: 448 </P><P>Number of genes in our essential gene list not classified as essential in the literature: 117
