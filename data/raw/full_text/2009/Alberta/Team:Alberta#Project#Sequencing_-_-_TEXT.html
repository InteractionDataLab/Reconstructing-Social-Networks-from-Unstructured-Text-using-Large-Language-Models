Sanger Sequencing Reaction
Procedure
In a 0.2 ml PCR tube add
template 5.0 ul (200 ng/ul)
VF primer 1.0 ul
dilute buffer 2.5 ul (reads BD dilute buffer on tape of cap) in PCR/Sequencing box
BD sequence mix 1.5 ul (reads BD)
Mix well.
Select program 'seq-dye' on PTC 200 thermal cycler
Run program. It will take about 2 hrs.
Remove tube from PCR machine and transfer 10 ul rxn mix to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Add
1.5 ul Blue NaOAc/EDTA
40 ul 95% ethanol
Let sit on ice 15 min
Centrifuge 10 min max speed
Should see a small blue dot at bottom of tube
Discard supernatant
Wash pellet with 500 ul of 70% ethanol
discard supernatant and spin briefly to bring down the residual liquid. Draw liquid off with a P10 pipette tip. *Do not disturb the pellet.*
Air dry for 10 min
Place in -20 C freezer to be delivered to MBSU 4th floor microbiology M534. Rxns delivered before 2pm will normally be returned the next day.
