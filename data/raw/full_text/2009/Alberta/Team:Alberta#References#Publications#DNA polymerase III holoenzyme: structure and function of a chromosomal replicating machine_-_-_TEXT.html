Abstract: DNA polymerase III holoenzyme contains two DNA polymerases embedded in a particle with 9 other subunits. This multisubunit DNA polymerase is the Eschericia coli chromosomal replicase, and it has several special features that distinguish it as a replicating machine. For example, one of its subunits is a circular protein that slides along DNA while clamping the rest of the machinery to the template. Other subunits act together as a matchmaker to assemble the ring onto DNA. Overall, E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is very similar in both structure and function to the chromosomal replicases of eukaryotes, from yeast all the way up to humans. This review summarizes our present knowledge about the function of the 10 subunits of this replicating machine and how they coordinate their actions for smooth duplication of chromosomes.
