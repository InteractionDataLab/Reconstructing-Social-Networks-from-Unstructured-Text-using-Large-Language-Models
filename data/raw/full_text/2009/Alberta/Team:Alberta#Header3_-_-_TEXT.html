RE. coli
Team RE. coli is the University of Alberta's 2009 International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team.  We are dedicated to the advancement of Synthetic Biology through the development of a reduced-genome model organism, Escherichia coli, via novel DNA assembly techniques.
Synthetic Biology
Synthetic Biology sits at the interface between biology and engineering.  Its goal is to produce modular biological circuits of increasing sophistication and usefulness.  Its guiding principle is to avoid biochemical complexity in favour of well-understood, well-characterized, and well-behaved molecular components that can be reliably assembled in a variety of ways.

Its guiding principle is to avoid biochemical complexity in favour of well-understood, well-characterized, and well-behaved molecular components that can be reliably assembled in a variety of ways.
Remarkably, the rapid rise of "SynBio" to prominence has been catalysed by an international undergraduate competition held annually at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston called the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) Jamboree.  At iGEM, student teams are evaluated not only on the originality and execution of their projects but also on a variety of other criteria that include: the ability to communicate complicated ideas effectively, adherence to ethical and legal principles, and the relevance of their work to real-world problems.  This year our team will explore the extent to which E. coli can be driven by a simplified artificial chromosome that incorporates features of design that include modularity of gene organization, standardization of gene expression, and simplification of the genetic code.
University of Alberta
The University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Alberta's beautiful capital city: Edmonton.  Throughout its 100 year history it has proven to be one of the finest Universities in promoting excellence in a variety of scientific and humanities fields.  Through innovations and frontiers of knowledge and skills, the University of Alberta allows for global recognition of its talented student body.  It provides a challenging and exciting learning environment that applies new knowledge throughout all disciplines whether through teaching, research, or creative pursuits.
