Abstract: Implementing DNA and protein microarrays into lab-on-a-chip systems can be problematic since these are sensitive to heat and strong chemicals. Here, we describe the functionalization of a microchannel with two types of magnetic beads using hydrodynamic focusing combined with a passive magnetic separator with arrays of soft magnetic elements. The soft magnetic elements placed on both sides of the channel are magnetized by a relatively weak applied external magnetic field (21 mT) and provide magnetic field gradients attracting magnetic beads. Flows with two differently functionalized magnetic beads and a separating barrier flow are introduced simultaneously at the two channel sides and the centre of the microfluidic channel, respectively. On-chip experiments with fluorescence labeled beads demonstrate that the two types of beads are captured at each of the channel sidewalls. On-chip hybridization experiments show that the microfluidic systems can be functionalized with two sets of beads carrying different probes that selectively recognize a single base pair mismatch in target DNA. By switching the places of the two types of beads it is shown that the microsystem can be cleaned and functionalized repeatedly with different beads with no cross-talk between experiments.
