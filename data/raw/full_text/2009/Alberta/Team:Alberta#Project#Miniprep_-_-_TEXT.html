Plasmid Miniprep
What you will need:
Overnight culture
Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit
Procedure:
Transfer 1.5 ml of culture to Eppendorf.
Spin down at 6000 rpm.
Discard supernatant and follow procedure in kit handbook
Determine concentration of purified plasmid with NanoVue spectrophotometer in G311.
Notes
Low speed pellet is easier to resuspend.
Step 2 in Qiagen, the alkaline lysis with buffer P2, should be brief to avoid damaging DNA.
