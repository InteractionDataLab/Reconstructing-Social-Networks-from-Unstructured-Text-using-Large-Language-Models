Abstract: A bacterial coning system for mapping and analysis of complex genomes has been developed. The BAC system (for bacterial artificial chromosome) is based on Escherichia colt and its single-copy plasmid F factor. It is capable of maintaining human genomic DNA fragments of >300 kilobase pairs. Individual clones of human DNA appear to be maintained with a high degree ofstructural stability in the host, even after 100 generations of serial growth. Because of high cloning efficiency, easy manipulation of the cloned DNA, and stable maintenance of inserted DNA, the BAC system may facilitate construction of DNA libraries of complex genomes with fuller representation and subsequent rapid analysis of complex genomic structure.
