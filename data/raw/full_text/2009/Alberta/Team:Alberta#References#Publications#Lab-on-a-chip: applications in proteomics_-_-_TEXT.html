Team:Alberta/References/Publications/Lab-on-a-chip: applications in proteomics

Abstract: Recent advances in chip-based separation of proteins provide methods that are faster and more convenient than conventional gel electrophoresis. Rapid and automated protein sizing on a chip is at the commercial stage and first attempts have been made to perform two-dimensional separation on a chip. Numerous designs have been described to interface a microfluidic chip to a mass spectrometer. Impressive integration efforts are demonstrated by the ability to perform on-chip trypsin digestion, separation and injection into a mass spectrometer with a single device.
