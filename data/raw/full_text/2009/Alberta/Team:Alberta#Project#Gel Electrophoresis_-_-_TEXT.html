Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
What you will need:
1X TAE
Graduated cylinder
250 mL flask
Agarose
Gel forming tray
Ethidium bromide
Procedure:
Dilute stock of 50X TAE to 1X with ddH2O.
Measure 70 mL of buffer for small gels (large gels 170 ml).
Transfer buffer to 250 mL flask (or 500 ml).
Weigh out enough agarose to make 1% gel. (1% of 70 mL is 0.70 g)
Transfer agarose to flask. Form an improvised cap by inverting 50 ml flask into neck.
Melt agarose in microwave, stirring ever 15-20 seconds. This should take about 2 min.
Allow agarose to cool.
While agarose is cooling, assemble gel pouring apparatus by inserting gate into slots. Use a pasteur pipet to run a bead of molten agarose along the inner and outer edges of the gates to help seal the box and prevent leaks.
Allow gel to cool until flask can be handled comfortably.
Place comb in the gel rig.
Pour agarose into gel tray.
Allow to solidify completely. While the gel is solidifying, prepare the samples. Add your sample and 2uL of 10x OG loading dye to a tube, then make the total volume of the tube up to 20 uL. Or 2.2 ul of 10x OG to 20 ul sample.
Pour 1X TAE over gel so that gel is covered by 3-5 mm of buffer.
Load samples into lane. Do not forget to load 1kb+ ladder into one of the lanes.
Hook electrodes to gel apparatus. Nucleic acids are negatively charged, so they will run to the positive (red) terminal.
Pipette 10 uL ethidium bromide (from 10 mg/ml stock) into the buffer at the bottom of the gel. Mix well
Turn on the gel. Run for 60 min @ 90V. Check with handheld UV Source.
Place gel in plastic wrap.
Carry to G311.
With bare hands log in as Gen 420 with password Molecular1.
Double click on the Genesnap from Syngene icon.
Click on the Green Button to start live image.
Put one glove on your left hand and place gel on transilluminator. Now do not touch anything with your left hand.
With your right hand slide the door down completely.
The transilluminator image on the screen should turn purple.
Use the arrows on the exposure button to increase the exposure time until the gel and bands are clearly visible.
If necessary use the zoom arrows to increase or decrease the size of the gel.
Reposition the gel if necessary – open the door with your right hand and move the gel with your gloved left hand.
To fine focus the image use the eye arrows.
When the image is sized and focused properly capture it by clicking the red button.
Print a photograph by clicking the printer icon in the tool bar at the top.
Record your use on the sheet. Supervisor=iGEM and your initials.
Log off.
Remove your gel and clean the transilluminator with water and dry with paper towels.
Take the gel back to the lab and dispose of properly.
Notes
Ethidium bromide is carcinogenic!
