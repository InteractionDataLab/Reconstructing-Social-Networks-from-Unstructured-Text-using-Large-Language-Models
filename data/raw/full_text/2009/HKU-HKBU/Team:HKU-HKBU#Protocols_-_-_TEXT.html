Protocols (in alphabetical order)
Bacteria Lysis
Harvest the culture by centrifuge (13krpm*1.5min) followed by washing with 1ml PBS twice. Later steps should be done on the ice.
Re-suspend the pellet with PBS (five times volume of the pellet) and protease inhibitor cocktail.
Sonication for (5.5seconds+1second pulse)*10 minutes and protein solutions are obtained.
BCA Quantification Analysis
Prepare a working solution of BCA reagent just prior to use by adding BCA Reagent A and BCA Reagent B with a ratio of 50:1. Mix the two solutions until a clear green solution forms. Prepare the BCA working reagent fresh daily. 100uL is required for each sample.
For each protein determination, add 2~5uL protein sample and 100uL BCA mixture into each well. Usually each sample will be loaded into 3 wells to reduce errors.
Put the 96-well plate in the warm room for about 30 minutes.
Read the wells in a suitable plate reader (e.g. Molecular Devices) at the wavelength of 562 nm.
Competent Cell Preparation for Electro Transformation
Materials
Media: LB (Both liquid media and media containing agar. Add certain antibiotic if necessary.)
Buffers and Solutions: 10% Glycerol.
Special Equipments : EP tubes (1.5mL), micropipette tips, centrifugation bottles (polypropylene tubes, 50mL), graduated flask (250mL*2, 5mL*1), plates and test tubes.
Steps
Sterilization
Including all materials in materials section.
Caution (Remind): use some special marks to distinguish the sterilized materials from the unsterilized ones.
Preparation after sterilization
Chill the 10%Glycerin to 4°C.
Decant LB containing agar into the plates.(If antibiotics are necessary, be sure that they are added when the media temperature is below 60°C.)
Streak the prepared strains onto the agar plates. Then incubate it at 37°C for 10-16 hours.
Pick up one single colony from the plate and pre-culture it overnight
Take 0.5mL overnight culture to 50mL LB bottle.
37 centigrade degree shaking 100~120 min to O.D. (wavelength 600) 0.45~0.6
On ice for 30min
4000rpm, 7min at 4 centigrade degree
Add origin volume 10% glycerol, suspend softly.
Repeat the step 7,8
Add origin volume 1/10 10% glycerol, suspend softly.
4000rpm, 7 min at 4 centigrade degree
Add origin volume 1/100 10% glycerol, suspend softly, store at -80°C.
Electro Transformation
Hold competent cells (from -80 centigrade degree refrigerator) on ice.
Gently mix ligation product (1-5 µL) with cells.
Transfer the cell/DNA mix into an electroporation cuvette. (Note: the gene pulser should already be set properly)
Time constant = 4.5 - 5.0 ms
Resistance = 200 W
Capacitance = 25 mFD for 0.1 cm gap cuvettes, set the volts to 1.8 kV
Pulse the cells once; the voltage display blinks, and the gene pulser beeps
Quickly transfer 37°C SOC to cuvette, mix by gently pipetting up and down, and transfer SOC/cells back to culture tube.
Bath in 37°C for 30~60 min.
Separate cells on petri-dishes, and cultivate them in 37°C for 12-16 hours.
Ligation
England Biolabs T4 DNA ligases are used here.
Choose reaction volume: 5-10 µL
Mix proper proportion (usually 3~5:1) of DNA fragment and vector.
Add 10 × ligase buffers.
Add 0.5 µL ligase per 10 µL final volume.
Bath in 16 centigrade degree water for 12 hour,
Begin transformation.
Membrane Biotinylation
Activate the membrane with methanol for 10-30seconds
Balance the membrane in PBS for 5 minutes
Place the membrane on a piece of filter paper.
Drop the protein-biotin complex onto the membrane.
Air-dry for 5 minutes.
Soak in methanol for 1minutes.
Place the membrane on a piece of filter paper.
Air dry for 15 minutes.
Pre-culture
One single colony is picked up from the agar plate and transferred to a tube.
Add 3~5mL LB broth to the tube and the specific resistance.
Culture overnight at 32 centigrade degree or 37°C.
Photolithography
The motors are fabricated by using a general surface manufacturing process for Si and SiO2. The motor bodies are made by reactive ion etching of thermal SiO2 layer on a Si substrate with a mask. Then the Si under the motors is anisotropically etched by wet etching, so that the motors are tethered to the Si base by two thin bridges designed to break upon sonication.
Photolithography is an optical means for transferring patterns onto a substrate. It is essentially the same process that is used in lithographic printing. Patterns are first transferred to an imagable photoresist layer. Photoresist is a liquid film that can be spread out onto a substrate, exposed with a desired pattern, and developed into a selectively placed layer for subsequent processing.
Overview of the photolithography process
Surface Preparation
Typical contaminants that must be removed prior to photoresist coating:
dust from scribing or cleaving (minimized by laser scribing)
atmospheric dust (minimized by good clean room practice)
abrasive particles (from lapping or CMP)
lint from wipers (minimized by using lint-free wipers)
photoresist residue from previous photolithography (minimized by performing oxygen plasma ashing)
bacteria (minimized by good DI water system)
films from other sources:
solvent residue
H2O residue
photoresist or developer residue
oil
silicone
Wafer priming: Adhesion promoters are used to assist resist coating.
Resist adhesion factors:
moisture content on surface
wetting characteristics of resist
type of primer
delay in exposure and prebake
resist chemistry
surface smoothness
stress from coating process
surface contamination
Wafer primers
Used for silicon:
primers form bonds with surface and produce a polar (electrostatic) surface
most are based upon siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si)
1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), (CH3)3SiNHSi(CH3)3
trichlorophenylsilane (TCPS), C6H5SiCl3
bistrimethylsilylacetamide (BSA), (CH3)3SiNCH3COSi(CH3)3
Used for gallium arsenide:
GaAs already has a polar surface
monazoline C
trichlorobenzene
xylene
Coating (Spin Casting)
Wafer is held on a spinner chuck by vacuum and resist is coated to uniform thickness by spin coating. Resist thickness is set by primarily resist viscosity and secondarily spinner rotational speed. Most resist thicknesses are 1-2 mm for commercial Si processes.
Fig 1 Photoresist Spin Coating
Fig 2 Stages of Resist Coating
Pre-Bake (Soft Bake)
Pre-bake is used to evaporate the coating solvent and to densify the resist after spin coating. Commercially, microwave heating or IR lamps are also used in production lines. Hot plating the resist is usually faster, more controllable, and does not trap solvent like convection oven baking.
‎Fig 3 Soft Bake
Alignment
Fig 4 Overview of Align/Expose/Develop Steps
Exposure
Fig 5 Exposure ("printing") systems
For simple contact, proximity, and projection systems, the mask is the same size and scale as the printed wafer pattern. I.e. the reproduction ratio is 1:1.
Projection systems give the ability to change the reproduction ratio. Going to 10:1 reduction allows larger size patterns on the mask, which is more robust to mask defects.
Mask size can get unwieldy for large wafers.
Most wafers contain an array of the same pattern, so only one cell of the array is needed on the mask. This system is called Direct Step on Wafer (DSW). These machines are also called “Steppers”.
Development
Types:
photographic emulsion on soda lime glass (cheapest)
Fe2O3 on soda lime glass
Cr on soda lime glass
Cr on quartz glass (most expensive, needed for deep UV litho)
Dimensions:
4” x 4” x 0.060” for 3-inch wafers
5” x 5” x 0.060” for 4-inch wafers
Polarity:
"light-field" = mostly clear, drawn feature = opaque
"dark-field" = mostly opaque, drawn feature = clear
Normally, this process requires at least two alignment mark sets on opposite sides of wafer or stepped region.
Post-Bake (Hard Bake)
Post bake is used to stabilize and harden the developed photoresist prior to processing steps that the resist will mask. The main parameter of this process is the plastic flow or glass transition temperature. It can remove any remaining traces of the coating solvent or developer. Also, it eliminates the solvent burst effects in vacuum processing. Post-bake introduces some stress into the photoresist and some shrinkage of the photoresist may occur. Longer or hotter post-bake makes resist removal much more difficult.
Processing Using the Photoresist as a Masking Film
Photoresist will undergo plastic flow with sufficient time and/or temperature.
Stripping
This process is to remove the photoresist and any of its residues. Simple solvents are generally sufficient for non-postbaked photoresists. There are two kinds of photoresist, i.e. positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Besides, plasma etching with O2 (ashing) is also effective for removing organic polymer debris.
Post Processing Cleaning (Ashing)
Light Sources
Ultraviolet light from gas-discharge lamps
"deep ultraviolet", produced by excimer lasers
Immersion lithography with numerical apertures
High-index immersion lithography (193nm)
Basics of Photolithography for Processing
Additive -> deposition
Subtractive -> etching
Modifying -> doping, annealing, or curing
Fig 6 Microfabrication Processes‎
Two primary techniques for patterning additive and subtractive processes
Etch-back:
photoresist is applied overtop of the layer to be patterned
unwanted material is etched away
Lift-off:
patterned layer is deposited over top of the photoresist
unwanted material is lifted off when resist is removed
Fig 7 Etch-back
Fig 8 Lift-off‎
Recombineering
Overnight cultures: 5mL medium (containing antibiotic where applicable) from single colonies grown at 32°C for 18 h.
Get 500uL from overnight cultures expanded into 50 ml of L medium in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, and incubated at 32°C for 2h (until OD600 of ca. 0.4–0.6).
Flasks were transferred to a shaking water bath at 42°C and incubated for 14–15 min, before cooling to 0°C as rapidly as possible in iced water.
After 15–20 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 0°C (4000 g, 9 min).
Cell pellets were carefully washed three times with sterilized ice-cold water (2 × 50 ml, then 1 × 1.5 ml) then re-suspended in 100–200 µl of ice-cold water.
Competent cells (50 µl) were transformed with 50–200 ng of (gel purified) linear dsDNA targeting cassette using a BioRad electroporator (1.8 kV, 25 mF, 200 W).
The LB medium (1 ml) was added to the transformed cell mixture, which was incubated at 32°C, for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, ca. 900 µl of supernatant media was discarded, and then the re-suspended cells were plated onto LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotic to select for resistant colonies. Reference to Watt et al [1].

Result analysis
The size of the tagged protein can be determined by the marker (protein ladder)
The amount of the protein can be estimated by the brightness of the band, or accurately analyzed by the software.
