Bacterial Mover
One of our design
One Possible way to detect the movement
We want to engineer the bacteria so that they can move coherently towards one direction so that in a macroscopical view, they can move certain object(hopefully).
Biologically we want to solve two questions:
How can bacteria find/stick to the object they are going to push? How can they know the direction to where they are going to push the object?
We solve this problem by stick the bacteria to the object only on their 'head'.
How can the bacteria constantly moving forward rather than tumbling at times?
We are finding ways to make them constantly move.
There are a lot of engineering problem we have discussed today, for example:
Will the bacteria be able to push a fan in the water to generate electricity?
How to improve the efficiency?
...
However, Xiaofu suggest that we should leave these questions to engineers. And at this stage we only need to prove that our bacteria can achieve the two criteria mentioned above.
