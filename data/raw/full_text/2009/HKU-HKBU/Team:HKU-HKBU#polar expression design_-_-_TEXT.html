Design
To achieve the interaction between bacteria and micromotors (bactomotor), polar expression of the protein streptavidin at one end of the bacteria is crucial in our project. When polar expression streptavidin bacteria encounter the biotin coated motor, there specific combination and bacteria mobility can generate propulsion force to the Bactomotor. Therefore, this synthetic device is capable to convert biological energy into mechanical work.
Two polar expression systems were constructed as follows:
AIDA system
In the plasmid pET-SP-GFP-Streptavidin-AIDA, pET is a promoter which needs T7 polymerase to promote its function; Signal peptide(SP) can bring the plasmid to the membrane region of the bacteria; GFP is integrated within the plasmid for detection; Streptavidin is specifically binding with biotin, which achieved the combination of the bacteria and biotin coated motor; AIDA is a transmembrane protein, which leads to the polar expression of the whole plasmid. However, AIDA protein can only be expressed in a LPS complete strain, which is a constraint when choosing the bacteria strains.
Lpp-OmpA system
The plasmid we used is Lpp-OmpA-GFP-streptavidin, which can be polarly expressed on one side of rod-shaped bacteria. Lpp functions as a signal peptide; OmpA is the player which can achieve the surface expression of specific proteins; GFP-Strp acts the same role as above.
After we successfully constructed two polar expression systems, which bacteria strain to be used becomes our crutial task.
Strain Selection
For AIDA system
To achieve polar expression, it is essential to screen and select bacteria species and strains equipped with outstanding swimming abilities as well as a complete LPS (lipopolysaccharide) layer. This layer, present in the bacterial cell wall, is required for polar expression of certain proteins(AIDI) The candidates included Escherichia. Coli strains: BL21, NCM3722, MG1655, MG3, and 2443 (strain 2443 ompT pIB264), and Salmonella SL7207.
For Lpp-OmpA system
Lpp-OmpA system can only achieve outer membrane surface expression. To select the strain which can polar express this plasmid, Lpp-OmpA were transformed into the strains above. GFP were fused into this plasmid for the conviniece of detection under fluorescent microscope.
