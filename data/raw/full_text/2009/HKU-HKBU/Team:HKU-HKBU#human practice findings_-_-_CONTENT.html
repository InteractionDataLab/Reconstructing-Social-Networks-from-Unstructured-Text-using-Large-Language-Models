</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of science students question the safety of genetically modified food, while the majority of students from other faculties do not. In contrast, the majority of medical students (i.e. future health care professionals) do not. We could not think of a satisfactory explanation for this.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_2">Figure 2</SPAN></H4><P>Genetically modified organisms should be retained in the laboratory setting and should never be released into the wild.
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of science students are aware that releasing GM organisms into the wild may disturb the natural gene pool of the organism, which may then lead to ecological consequences. Students from other faculties are less aware of the consequences.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_3">Figure 3</SPAN></H4><P>Manipulating, inflicting trauma or killing primates (e.g. monkeys) for experimental purpose is morally wrong.
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Primates are animals who resemble human beings the most, and in fact a lot of experiment has been done on primates (with or without inflicting trauma) for the sake of understanding human sciences, especially psychology. The majority of university students in Hong Kong, even science students, may be aware of the fact that primates look like human beings, and this resemblance makes them “more humane”, to the extent that they should be respected.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_4">Figure 4</SPAN></H4><P>Manipulating, inflicting trauma or killing mice/guinea pigs for experimental purpose is morally wrong.
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of medical students think that manipulating, inflicting trauma or killing mouse/guinea pig for experimental purpose is not morally wrong. Is it possible that they are aware of the fact that mouse/guinea pig are used in many pre-clinical trials of drugs, and without doing so, clinical drugs trials (i.e. on humans) cannot proceed? That indicates manipulating, inflicting trauma or killing mice/guinea pig for drug development is morally acceptable, since this saves human lives.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_5">Figure 5</SPAN></H4><P>Cell types are interchangeable, e.g. muscle cells can become blood cells.
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of students hold the belief that cell types are not interchangeable, which is in general correct until now. However, since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells, it may be possible in the future that different cell types can be inter-converted through the induction of pluripotency, although lots of researches have to be conducted in order for a conclusion to be made. As a general rule of science, theories may not hold true forever.
</P><P>A pitfall in interpreting the results is that those who chose “yes” may not actually know about induced pluripotent stem cells.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_6">Figure 6</SPAN></H4><P>If the parent of a child has a inherited disease, the child would have the same disease.
</P><P>Discussion:
This statement is false. For a child having one parent affected by an inherited disease:
</P><UL><LI> For autosomal/X-linked dominant disorders with one affected parent, only 50% of the children will be affected.
</LI><LI> For autosomal recessive disorders, both parents are carriers of the disease.
</LI><LI> For X-linked recessive disorders, only half of the male children will be affected, and half of the female will become carriers.
</LI><LI> For Y-linked disorders, only male children are affected.
</LI><LI> For mitochondrial diseases, only females can pass on the disease but not the males.
</LI><LI> For polygenic disorders, there is no clear-cut pattern of inheritance.
</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_7">Figure 7</SPAN></H4><P>All infectious substances are living things.
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of students answered “No” to this question. However, it is unclear whether they think that viruses are non-living (which is controversial), or actually they think about prions which is definitely non-living proteins.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_8">Figure 8</SPAN></H4><P>DNA only exists in the nucleus of cells - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Art, business and social science students are probably unaware of the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. For prokaryotic cells (e.g. bacterial cells), they are no nuclei. For eukaryotic cells, DNA does not only exist in nuclei, but also in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_9">Figure 9</SPAN></H4><P>One of the ways to introduce genes into a bacterium is to introduce a plasmid into it - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Art, business and social science are not familiar with the term “plasmid”, which is essential in synthetic biology.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_10">Figure 10</SPAN></H4><P>All bacteria are capable of locomotion-False
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_11">Figure 11</SPAN></H4><P>Gene therapy has already been widely used in modern medicine - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Gene therapy has been successful in some situations, but it has not yet gone into mainstream medicine. Further advances are needed in order to prove its efficacy in the myriad of diseases.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_12">Figure 12</SPAN></H4><P>DNA is made up of 4 types of bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C) - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Without understanding the base pairs of DNA, we would never understand how DNA encode genetic information. From the result of this questionnaire, we can see that the majority of laypeople do not understanding how DNA works.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_13">Figure 13</SPAN></H4><P>RNA can be genetically inheritable - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Art, business and social science students probably can choose the right answer if the question becomes “DNA is genetically inheritable”. However, when it comes to RNA, many of them choose “I don’t know”. They are unaware of the presence of RNA viruses.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_14">Figure 14</SPAN></H4><P>Green florescent protein allows the identification of protein expression - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The role of Green Florescent Protein as a reporter of expression is largely unknown to art, business and social science students. It is possible that they have not heard about this protein, or they may not know the term “protein expression”, or both.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_15">Figure 15</SPAN></H4><P>Cells communicate with each other by electrical signals only - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Cells also communicate with each other by chemical signals, e.g. hormones, through ligand-receptor interaction.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_16">Figure 16</SPAN></H4><P>Normal human cells have unlimited replication potential - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>It is possible that some students answered “yes” because they think that normal equals healthy and for healthy cells they must have the ability to replicate. This is an oversimplified view.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_17">Figure 17</SPAN></H4><P>Bacteria cannot exchange their genes among themselves - False
</P><P>Discussion
</P><P>The majority of art, business and social science students do not know about bacterial conjugation, which is an important concept within the realm of synthetic biology and genetic engineering.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_18">Figure 18</SPAN></H4><P>All mutations in DNA have effect(s) on the cell - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>This shows that art, business and social science students have an oversimplified view of DNA mutation, without knowing the fact that some DNA is not expressed, e.g. intron of DNA.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_19">Figure 19</SPAN></H4><P>Virus replicate outside the cells - False
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>The majority of art, business and social science students do not know where virus replicate. As a result, it is possible that they do not know that virus can be manipulated to carry genes into cells.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_20">Figure 20</SPAN></H4><P>The function of genes is to manufacture proteins - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>Actually, the function of genes is to manufacture proteins and RNAs (e.g. to manufacture the RNA in ribosomes). Quite a significant proportion of “Don’t know” answers were received from art, business and social science students. We postulate that laypeople actually do know that genes affects the functioning of the body, without knowing what causes this function: proteins and RNA.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_21">Figure 21</SPAN></H4><P>In synthetic biology, the most commonly used organism is Escherichia coli - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>It is possible that many art, business or social science students do not know about E. coli besides not knowing that it is the most commonly used organism in synthetic biology.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Figure_22">Figure 22</SPAN></H4><P>Up to this moment, scientists have successfully synthesized an organism from molecules - True
</P><P>Discussion:
</P><P>In 2003, it was reported that the whole genome of the bacteriophage phi X 174 had been assembled synthetically from scratch and fully infectious X174 virions were recovered after electroporation into Escherichia coli. The majority of all students do not know about this.
