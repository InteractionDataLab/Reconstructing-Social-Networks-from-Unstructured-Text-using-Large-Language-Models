Assembly of BactoMotor
Introduction
Our BactoMotor comprises of three devices – Micro-Motor , Direction Controller and Speed Controller .
As their names indicate, the Micro-Motor is the core part of the BactoMotor, and it is small (micrometer scale). The Direction Controller ensures that the propelling force generated by the bacteria translates into a coordinated and directional rotation of the motor. The Speed Controller is used to control the speed of the Bacto-motor
Each device is designed, engineered and tested separately, and functional on its own. After testing and fine-tuning, the devices are assembled to form the final System BactoMotor. The end-results is a micrometer-scale BactoMotor with unidirectional rotation, its speed controllable.
Prodecures
Step 1. Installation of Micro-Motor
The Micro-Motor will be installed into a microchip container (Fig.1a, 1b) with separated chambers. Only one side of the arms of the motor is coated with Biotin ( see the Directional Controller ).

Step 2. Introduction of Bacteria
The Bacteria with both Directional Controller and Speed Controller Modules implemented will be introduced to the Micro-Motor (Figure 2).

Step 3. Action of Directional Controller
Under the effect of the Direction Controller, all bacteria will only bind onto the sides coated with biotin on each blade of the Micro-Motor.(Fig.3a, 3b)

Step 4. Removing Excessive Bacteria
The extra bacterial cells will be removed by medium flush. (Fig. 4)
Fig.4: Bacteria not binding to the Micro-Motor will be flushed away by medium flush.
Step 5. BactoMotor in Action
As the Bacteria swims, they will push the motor into rotation. (clockwise as demonstrated in Fig. 5a, 5b)

Step 6. Using the Speed Controller
To utilize the Speed Controller Module, inducer aTc is added to the Microchip containing the Micro-Motor. Increase in concentration of the inducer aTc will lead to an overall increase in rotational speed of the Bacto-Motor. (Fig. 6a, 6b)
Fig.6a: On additional of 0.5 effective dose of inducer aTc
Fig.6b: On additional of 1.0 effective dose of inducer
On the other hand, dilution/chelation of the inducer will decrease the speed of the motor.
