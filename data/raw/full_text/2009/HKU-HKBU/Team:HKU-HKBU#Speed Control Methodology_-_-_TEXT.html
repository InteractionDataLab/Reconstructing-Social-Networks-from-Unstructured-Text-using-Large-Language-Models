Speed Control - Methodology
cheZ knockout of YBE01 and YBS01
Recombineering strategy is used for the cheZ knockout in YBE01 and YBS01. Because the protocols for the knockout process are the same for these two strains, we just took YBS01 as an example to illustrate the whole procedures.
Step 1
A pSim6 plasmid, which could help Recombineering process, was transformed into the competent cell of YBS01 by electroporation. After recovering with SOC solution for 30 minutes, they were spread to Agar plates with Ampicillin resistance. Then one single colony on the plate was picked up for pre-culture .
Step 2
A DNA fragment with homologous arms made by PCR using specific primers was transformed into the YBS01 with psim6. After recovering with SOC solution for 120 minutes, they were spread to Agar plates with chloramphenicol resistance.
Step 3
PCR was applied with test primers and with single colonies on the plate as templates to examine if the recombination strategy was successful.
Regulation of cheZ expression
Step 1
YBE02 and YBS02 (delta cheZ) strain were used to test whether the inducible regulation of cheZ would succeed. With no background expression of cheZ, we would be able to achieve precise control over intracellular cheZ level through regulated gene expression. The plasmid BBa_K283014 or BBa_K283002 was transformed into the competent cell of  and YBE02 and YBS02 of cheZ expression was induced through incubating with different concentrations of IPTG or aTc and various induced time. The samples were gathered at specific time and with different IPTG or aTc concentrations as follows.
Step 2
The bacteria lysis underwent to release the protein samples. BCA quantification analysis was done to detect the concentrations of these protein samples. After analyzing the concentrations of each protein samples, we used the formula: total amount of protein= sample concentration*sample volume to adjust the sample volume to the same loading volume by adding the mixture buffer. Equal loading of protein samples were ensured in Western blotting after these adjustments.
Step 3
A wider range of aTc concentrations were added to YBE02 and YBS02 with the plasmid BBa_K283002
