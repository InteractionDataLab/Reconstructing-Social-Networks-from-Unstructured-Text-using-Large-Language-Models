Strain Selection
To maximize the efficiency of motor, it is essential to screen and select bacteria species and strains equipped with outstanding swimming abilities as well as a complete LPS (lipopolysaccharide) layer. This layer, present in the bacterial cell wall, is required for polar expression of certain proteins. Our preliminary candidates included Escherichia. Coli strains: BL21, NCM3722, MG1655, MG3, and 2443 (strain 2443 ompT pIB264), and Salmonella SL7207.
Swim plate assay
This determines the fastest-swimming bacteria among our candidates. Different strains are first introduced to suitable agar media, and the diameter of the colonies are measured every hour in the first 8 hours in order to obtain approximated data of their swimming speed. The data are also recorded overnight for confirmation. No or inconspicuous increase in diameter is classified as negative result. The swim plates of BL21, NCM3722 and MG1655 yielded negative results. Although the clouded area of the MG3 plate showed augmentation in diameter, the colony was of the shape of dispersed clouds whereas a positive result would show distinct  circles as a result of chemotaxis. We attribute this to contamination by other bacteria. Salmonella - a bacteria with well known swimming abilities (~4.5mm/hr) - was employed as our positive control. However, surprisingly, E.coli 2443 shows even more impressive performance, with a speed of approximate 5.5mm increase in radius every hour at the end of eight-hour-experiment.

LPS completeness
LPS takes vital part in specifically expressing streptavidin, the protein enabling the binding of bacteria to motor in our project. After literature reviews, E. coli 2443 [1] and Salmonella [2] are identified to possess complete LPS layer. Their ability to express desirable proteins on the head is examined in later experiment.
Conclusion
Combining the results of two parts, E. coli 2443 and Salmonella SL7207 are adopted in further experiment and entitled with PB (Propeller Bacteria) 001 and PB 002 correspondingly.
