iGEM Thought-shower
Monday 12 July
Each team member researched their own ideas for our project
Tuesday 13 July
Afternoon presentations - possible projects included
Bacto-Stat
Counterfeit Bill Detector
Traffic light-obedient bacteria
Light-induced pigment production
Predator prey bacteria + a parasite
Modelling pesticide resistance
Galvanotaxis
Wave-pulse bacteria
Ai2 quorum sensing system
Conclusions
Decided to concentrate on a pigment output. Wednesday plans involve discussing ideas for pigments, following the same meeting pattern used on Tuesday. Ideally the  pigment output would be a new registry part which could then be connected to any input system
Wednesday 14 July
Investigated possible outputs, with a kind of bacterial printer in mind.
Colour Wheels
Primary school style: BLUE, YELLOW, RED
True colour wheel: YELLOW, CYAN, MAGENTA
Autochrome: ORANGE, GREEN, VIOLET
Viable Pigments
In an ideal system, we would have lots of pathways making different coloured pigments from a common precursor.  One can dream...
Carotenoids - RED, ORANGE, YELLOW
Biobricks exist for part of the system
apparently you can go from yellow to white (cool)
Pseudomons aeruginosa - RED, GREENISH/BLUE
Pyocyanin is greenish/blue, can be synthesized from chorismic acid, or more simply, from phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA)
Knocking out one of the genes between PCA and pyocyanin leads to the production of a red pigment
Chromobacterium violacein - VIOLET, CYAN
Violacein is a violet pigment
A precursor is cyan.
BROWN
melanin - easily attainable
anyway we could make black?
Follow ups for tomorrow
Possible inputs
Population control
bacterial chlorophyll?
Thursday 15 July
Hoping to start wet work on Monday!
Pigments
Duncan has orange and brown bacteria we can start to work with.  The melanin gene has been sequenced, has a restriction site we would need to remove to submit it to the registry.
We have the genes for violacein! However there seem to be several internal restriction sites within the plasmid that would need to be removed, with three being within the violacein operon.
Contacted the authors of a paper to get the genes for pyocyanin biosynthesis.  Two of them have forbidden restriciton sites, so we'll need to figure out how to remove them.
Inputs
explored the idea of using common repressor / inducer systems - arabinose, lac repressor, and tet repressor - to control pigment production
scourged the registry for lots of different inducible promoters
Population Control
Crispian proposed a growth control dependency pathway that would make the growth of each type of bacterium (red colour-producing, blue colour-producing, yellow colour-producing, for example) dependent on one other using HSLs
Friday 16 July
found where to get PCA, pyocyanin precursor
did an inventory of supplies
familiarized ourselves with protocols and planned for next week's wet work
Thinking about a team logo
Current plans for the wet work involve starting transformation of the bacteria in order to view the pigment colours and intensities. For this we will need to create competant cells and then use Duncan's plasmids to transform the violet and brown and the biobrick registary parts to transform the red and orange.
The Project
Monday 20 July
Finalized our project into a few objectives
Pigment production
Transform E. coli to produce pigment
Hook up the pigmentation genes to inducible promoters
Shutter mechanism
build, test a shutter mechanism
Hook up pigmentation genes under inducible promoters to the shutter mechanism
Improve on previous iGEM projects
arsenic sensor?
bacterial photography?
Modelling
shutter mechanism
Growth rate regulation
Goals for Wet Work
Inducible pigment production integrated with a shutter mechanism
Possibly attach the arsenic bio-sensor to our green/red pigment output
Tuesday 21 July
Proceedure to make competant cells started
One colony of TOP10 E. coli added to 50ml of LB broth. Incubated overnight in the shaking incubator
Planned and prepared for transformation
Media made up
Two litres of 0.1 mM HEPES
One litre of LB broth (for making competant cells)
100ml of 10% glycerol
Ampicillin made up with water to make 8 x 1ml aliquots of 100mg/ml
15 LB agar and 100ug/ml Ampicillin plates made up
Dry work
Plan for tomorrow
prepare trimethoprim stock solution
make LB agar and trimethoprim plates as well as LB agar and copper + tyrosine plates
Complete proceedure for making competant cells (transfer bacteria into big flask, wash with HEPES, and aliquot into glycerol)
Attempt transformations by electroporation
pPSX plasmid (violet)
melA plasmid (brown)
biobricks
Wednesday 22 July
competent cell procedure
completed (see protocol page for details of the procedure)
planned and prepared for electroporation tomorrow
made up 4 LB agar and 100ug/ml Ampicillin, 0.5ug/mL tyrosine, 15 ug/mL CuSO4 plates
plan to transform TOP10 competent bacteria with
melanin plasmid, pTRCmelA plasmid --plate onto tyrosine/copper/ampicillin plate
violacein plasmid,Plasmid pPSX-Vio+ -- plate onto trimethoprim plate
orange biobrick, BBa_K152005 -- plate onto ampicillin plate
promoter, R0011 -- plate onto ampicillin plate
more?
need to make trimethoprim stock solution 10mg/mL acetone, and plate at 50ug/mL
tried to make the stock solution today, couldn't get the solid trimethoprim to dissolve in acetone
need to work out exact volumes of plasmid to be added to the cell (concentrations written on the side of the bottles)
Thursday 23 July
Electroporation
transformed Top10 competent cells, incubated the following plates:
Top10 + pTRCmelA plasmid on tyrosine/copper/ampicillin plate
Top10 + Plasmid pPSX-Vio+ on trimethoprim plate
Top10 + BBa_K152005 on ampicillin plate
Top 10 + R0011 on ampicillin plate
1:10 dilutions of each as well
