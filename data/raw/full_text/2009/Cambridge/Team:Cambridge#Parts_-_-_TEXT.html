Reporter
MelA. The gene (melA) codes for a tyrosinase which produces a dark brown pigment from L-tyrosine. Production of the pigment requires the addition of copper and L-tyrosine supplements (the copper acts as a cofactor for the gene product) but no other precursors. The BioBrick sequence includes the native ribosome binding site.
1844bp
Reporter
Violacein. Produces a purple pigment (violacein) from L-tyrosine. The operon contains five genes (VioA-E) each with their own ribosome binding sites.
7346bp
Reporter
Vio operon ABDE. Produces a dark green pigment from L-tyrosine. Formed from the vio operon biobrick (BBa_K274002) with the vioC gene removed by restriction digest with BamHI and BglII. This sequence contains four genes, vioA, vioB vioD and vioE, each preceded by their own ribosome binding site.
6032bp
Reporter
Vio operon ABCE. Produces a light green pigment from L-tyrosine. Formed from the vio operon biobrick (BBa_K274002) with the vioD gene removed by restriction digest with BglII and BclI. This sequence contains four genes, vioA, vioB vioC and vioE, each preceded by their own ribosome binding site.
6200bp
Composite
CrtEBI with rbs. This Composite Biobrick is created by standard assembly of 3 basic Biobricks coding for enzymes CrtE, CrtB and CrtI (each with rbs). Together, enzymes CrtE, CrtB and CrtI convert colourless farnesyl pyrophosphate to red lycopene (via intermediates geranylgeranyl pyroiphosphate and phytoene). The red lycopene pigment can then be used as a coloured signal output, e.g. for biosensors.
3385bp
Generator
CrtEBI under constitutive promoter. This Biobrick is created by putting enzyme cassette CrtEBI (with individual rbs) of Part BBa_K274100 under constitutive promoter R0011. Amount of lycopene produced can be measured by photospectrometer with absorbance at 475nm (lycopene extraction using acetone).
3448bp
Generator
CrtEBI under pBad promoter. This Biobrick is created by putting enzyme cassette CrtEBI (with individual rbs) of Part BBa_K274100 under arabinose-induced promoter I0500. Amount of lycopene produced can be measured by photospectrometer with absorbance at 475nm (lycopene extraction using acetone).
4603bp
Composite
CrtEBIY with rbs. This Composite Biobrick is created by standard assembly of 4 basic Biobricks coding for enzymes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI and CrtY (each with rbs). Together, enzymes CrtE, CrtB, CrtI and CrtY convert colourless farnesyl pyrophosphate to orange beta-carotene (via intermediates geranylgeranyl pyroiphosphate, phytoene and lycopene). The orange beta-carotene pigment can then be used as a coloured signal output, e.g. for biosensors.
4555bp
Generator
CrtEBIY under constitutive promoter. This Biobrick is created by putting enzyme cassette CrtEBIY (with individual rbs) of Part BBa_K274200 under constitutive promoter R0011. Amount of beta-carotene produced can be measured by photospectrometer with absorbance at 455nm (beta-carotene extraction using acetone).
4618bp
Generator
CrtEBIY under pBad promoter. This Biobrick is created by putting enzyme cassette CrtEBIY (with individual rbs) of Part BBa_K274200 under arabinose-induced promoter I0500. Amount of beta-carotene produced can be measured by photospectrometer with absorbance at 455nm (beta-carotene extraction using acetone).
5773bp
Composite
CrtY under Pbad promoter (I0500). This construct is created by putting BBa_K118013 (rbs+CrtY) under the control of Pbad promoter (I0500), by standard assembly. When used in double-transformation together with a constitutive lycopene-producing device (e.g. BBa_K274110), the resulting system can produce colour change (red to orange) upon induction with arabinose.
