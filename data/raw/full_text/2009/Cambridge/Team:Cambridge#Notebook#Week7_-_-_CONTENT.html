</P><P>In order to collect liquid culture colour for characterisation with the plate-reader, two cultures were grown. One contained 10mM of 3-oxo-C6-HSL in order to increase the level of pigment, hopefully such that it can be seen, and therefore characterised, in liquid culture.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="MelA_BioBrick_3">MelA BioBrick</SPAN></H4><P>Two PCR's were run, using the MelA-biobrick intermediate created last week (minus one PstI site) as the template:

</LI><LI>Primer A and Primer B
</LI></UL></DD></DL><P>These two will remove the second PstI site. 
</P><P>After running the gel, the correct products were excised and purified using the QuiGen gel purification kit. The  products were then used for a further PCR run (overnight) using primers A and F.
</P><P>If the correct products were removed, then this final run should produce the MelA BioBrick.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Dry_Work_4">Dry Work</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Practise_Presentation">Practise Presentation</SPAN></H4><P>We prepared an iGEM-style presentation for the afternoon, and presented it for the faculty. The following comments and suggestions were made regarding it:
</P><DL><DD><UL><LI>Pictures need to be close-up of the coloured colonies, with no satilites and with a control for comparison
</LI><LI>Slide design should be looked at - in particular the coloured sidebar, which created dead space
</LI><LI>Forward rather than a backward explanation (Sensor - threshold - colour) and with a navigation bar (perhaps at the side?) to show the audience where we are in the talk
</LI><LI>Ways to characterise the different strains and their effects were discussed, such as using a bar graph with coloured pictures of the cells in the boxes - an effective way to show a large amount of information on one slide.
</LI><LI>Testing the threshold. It was suggested that as well as attaching the different threshold levels to different colours, we first attach them all to the same colour as proof they respond to different input levels
</LI><LI>The actual physical product should be constructed in a prototype form, such as by using 5-well microscope slides. We were also encouraged to think more about this final product and how we would practically produce it.
</LI><LI>BioBrick numbers need to be included
</LI><LI>The pigment production requires a little more science background
</LI></UL></DD></DL><P>We also decided not too concentrate on the phzS and phzM pigments, as these have already been made into Biobricks. Instead, we will just concentrate on the proper characterisation of the carotenoid pigments, creating the MelA and Violacein biobricks, and attaching them too the threshold level amplifiers.
