How to Edit the Wiki
Basics
Headers
When editing a wiki, you can make different ranks of titles. Header 1 is the biggest, mostly for pages titles. Other headers are of decreasing size up to Header 4.
To make text you are writing a header, simply surround it by equals signs.
E.g. For a Header 1 title:
= Project =
E.g. Header 2 titles:
== Introduction ==
E.g. Header 3:
=== Monday ===
Paragraphs
Press Enter TWICE to do a new paragraph. Leave a whole line between paragraphs.
Bullet Points
To do a list of bullet points, just start each point with a * on a new line.
To indent bullet points (useful for sub-bullet points) do a :*
Uploading Images:
Upload pictures and files with this link:
https://2009.igem.org/Special:Upload
Once uploaded copy the name of the image title. e.g.: Image:cambridgepic.jpg
Then put this in your document with square brackets on each side. e.g. [[Image:cambridgepif.jpg]]
You can do some stuff to the picture too. e.g. for it to be 200pixels wide and on the right of the page:
[[Image:cambridgepif.jpg | 200px | right]]
