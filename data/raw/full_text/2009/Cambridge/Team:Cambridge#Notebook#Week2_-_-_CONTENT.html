</LI><LI>pPSX plasmid (violet) = the pigment is on a low copy number plasmid
</LI></UL><P>The melanin plates were left out on the bench to see if the brown pigment developed over time. The rest of the plates were stored in the fridge for making plasmid stocks (procedure starting next week).
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="BioBrick_Construction">BioBrick Construction</SPAN></H3><P>Used ApE to examine the melanin plasmid:
</P><P>This contains only two forbidden restriction sites within the actual gene. These could be removed by PCR.
</P><P>Also looked at the vio operon:
</P><P>As this contains a large number of the forbidden biobrick restriction sites, it would be impossible to prepare the biobrick using PCR alone. The operon would have to be synthesised with these sites removed to be feasible as a biobrick.
</P><P>The other possible pigments are the orange biobrick system and the pseudomonas red/green pigment.

</LI><LI>The products of the reactions catalyzed by VioD and VioA  are combined in a 1:1 ratio by VioB; what happens to the production of cyan and violacein if flux through VioD is much greater than flux through VioA?  Which might be the case if VioD and VioA are induced by different inputs that are not reliably equal.
</LI><LI>What are the dynamics of the flux through VioC?  Would analyze by producing cyan, and then switching on VioC and measuring absorbance.  Considerations for biosensors - if presence of whatever the biosensor is sensing causes cyan production, and then low rate of VioC expression slowly turns cyan into violet, violet being an indication that the sensor is old and past its shelf life .

The protein produced in the device binds to the promoter as an activator, such that an incoming gene transcription will be amplified to various levels with appropriate choices of activator and promoter. The Cambridge team in 2007 looked at these devices.

</P><P>We therefore looked into an AHL-regulated arrangement, where the slowest-growing strain would produce signalling molecules, allowing the faster strains to grow. The medium speed strain could also have a signalling molecule for induction of the fast strain.
</P><P>The idea has a good chance of working in a liquid medium, where the relevant signalling molecules can easily disperse. However, on a plate, spatial effects have to be considered. Due to this difficulty, we chose not to continue this idea further.

They investigated using different promoters, and found only some combinations to give bistability.
</P><P>Many iGEM teams have attempted to recreate a bistable switch; none have so far fully succeeded! The most recent were Peking 2007 and Bologna 2008.
</P><P>Peking 2007 designed a bistable circuit as part of their &quot;push on, push off&quot; device. They connected together two mutual inhibitors, and showed that this gave an agar spread that had red in places and green in others. This suggests that they made a bistable device. However, they did not progress to activation by external sources.
</P><P>Bologna's iGEM project in 2008 was a bistable circuit, called &quot;E.coli PROM&quot;. They performed extensive modelling of the device, but did not complete fabrication.
</P><P>This leaves an iGEM team with a good opportunity. Building on Peking and Bologna, amongst others, a working, and inducible bistable could be made, an iGEM first.
</P><P>However, we decided that given the large amount of work which we need to do on pigments, and the fact that a non-functioning bistable would not be novel, we would not progress further with this idea.
