Sensitivity Tuner
Response of the pBAD promoter to arabinose concentration
Tight regulation, modulation and and high level expression by vectors containing the arabinose pBAD promoter, Guzman et al. 1995
A high throughput approach to promoter study using Green Fluorescent, Pigment Rao et al. 2008
AraC changes conformation in the presence of arabinose to permit transcription. It is always bound in the region around pBAD:
