Silver Nano Particles - Results
Spectrophotometry
Figure 1 shows the observed absorption spectrum for silver nanoparticles reported by Naik in doi:10.1038/nmat758. Figure 2 shows the spectrum observed from the incubated sample containing silver binding peptide, silver nitrate and sodium ascorbate. That the production of silver nanoparticles is explicitly due to the presence of the peptide AG4 is confirmed by the absence of expected the absorbance peaks (400-500nm) in a negative control containing only buffers, silver nitrate, and sodium ascorbate.
A good agreement is observed, the deviation can be explained as a result of a different size distribution in our sample as further confirmed by SEM.
Electron Microscopy
Electron micrographs of an incubated sample of silver binding peptide, with Sodium Ascorbate, Silver Nitrate, and water. Crystalline structures indicating the presence metallic particles are clearly visible.

The protocol to create silver particles works and can be combined with the gene expression in vesicles to influence the size distribution.
