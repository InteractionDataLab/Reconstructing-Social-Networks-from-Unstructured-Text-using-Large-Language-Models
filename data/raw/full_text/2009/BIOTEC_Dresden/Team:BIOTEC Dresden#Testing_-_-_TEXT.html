Day 0
Here we have a new wiki page.... Let's check if we can modify the template.
Yay, works. Now, it's time to clean this up.
Day 0.5
Let's see... we have some additional floating boxes for content like links and news.
The question now is: what exactly do we want to put there?
And why is this white box so limited?
Day 0.6
Quite a lot of problems arise from a mistakenly places foot(er)...
Day 1
Set up a color scheme, it's still not really convincing. The opacity of the biotec logo has to be corrected, too. Oh, and the header code has to be cleaned up.
Day 1.5
A lot of spacings have to be fixed. And seriously - significant white lines in wiki editing - come on...
At least the home and the team page were created.
