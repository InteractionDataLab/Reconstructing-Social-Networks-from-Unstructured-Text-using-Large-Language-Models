21st September’09:
1. A silver Binding Peptide Assay has been carried out along with the Bradford Assay.
22th September’09:
1. Minipreps pFRT-DhfR has been done.
2. Miniprep DNA concentrations for of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP and TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR has been measured.
3. A test for Blasticidin resistance has been carried out for TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR containing plasmids.
4. A test for Trimethoprin resistance has been carried out for pMA-FRT-DhfR (500bp, 1000bp, 2000bp, 5000bp, 10,000bp) containing plasmids and also for GB2005Red and Fos2-SpectR.
23rd September’09:
1. Minipreps of pRhaFlp has been done followed by a restriction digest with NheI.
2. A restriction digest of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP has been done with PvuII.
3. Reinoculation of pTetFlp-KanR has been done.
24th September’09:
1. The restriction digest of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP is run on a gel to gel purify the insert.
2. A midiprep for pTetFlp-KanR is done and the concentrations are measured.
25th September’09:
1. The miniprep concentrations of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP and TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR have been measured.
2. The previous colonies are sub-cultured in liquid broth and also for the pRhaFlp-CmR-KanR in LB-Cm10-Kan15 and Trimethoprin plates.
