Vesicle formation in a microfluidic chamber
Strategy
Vesicles are formed using a microfluidic system, allowing for small reaction volumes and a controllable environment. The system is used to create emulsions of material in aqueous phase in a lipid phase. Proteins and various buffers are eventually added to the aqueous phase to carry out transcription and translation of the protein of interest in the vesicles, in this case, FLP recombinase. The production of FLP can be checked by tagging the final protein with a fluorescent protein like GFP, which can be then viewed using fluorescent microscopy.
Methods
This is how we created vesicles in a microfluidic chamber.
Results
Here are the results for the vesicle formation in a microfluidic chamber.
