14th September’09:
1. Minipreps of GB05MN-Fosmid-BsdR pSC101-SpectR  has been done and concentration is measured.
2. A PCR for KanR2 was done using Kan-Fwd and Kan-Rev primers.
3. Colonies are saved from both plates.
4. A sequencing reaction has been set up for the positive clones of GB05 RhaFlpCmR  with primerF and primerR primers using Taq polymerase.
5. A enzyme digest for GB05MN FosBsdR-pSC101SpectR has been set.
17th September’09:
1. A test digest run is performed with the minipreps from fosmids using HindIII enzyme.
18th September’09:
1. Minipreps of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP and TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR has been .
