Meeting Reports
We had a team meeting every Tuesday, over tea and soft cakes. The agenda was to discuss about the progress of the lab work, general brain storming and trouble shooting the experimental work. These meetings were also meant for discussing administrative stuff like registering the team, fund raising, jamboree attendance etc.
