Health and Safety Considerations
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
Researcher safety : NO. All the materials and methods used are classified as S1 safety level, and for these we follow the safety guidelines and regulations of the institute (Biotec, Dresden) and GLP.
The standard Lab safety regulations followed at our institute are as follows-
1.  Make yourself familiar with the location of fire extinguishers (in the hallway next to the    doors into the teaching lab) and the first aid kit. In case of a fire alarm leave the lab    immediately without rushing and gather in the meeting area (in front of Netto market).
2.  In S1 labeled areas the windows have to be closed.
3.  The microorganisms used during the practical course have to be regarded as if they are    potential pathogens. All experiments must therefore be carried out with precaution.
4.  Remains from liquid cultures of microorganisms are collected and disposed by the    supervisor. Culture plates are disposed in the S1 waste bin.
5.  Wearing a lab coat is mandatory. The lab coat remains in the teaching lab during the    duration of the course. No open shoes like sandals or flip-flops.
6.  It is not allowed to eat, chew gum, drink, smoke or apply make-up in the lab.
7.  Wash your hands before you leave the lab; after disinfection if necessary.
8.  Microorganisms have to be kept in closed vessels.
9.  Microorganisms should not contaminate the lab bench or the lab coat. Spilled culture    broth has to be covered with paper towels soaked with the appropriate disinfectant (70%    Ethanol). Contaminated surfaces have to be cleaned with a disinfectant.
10. Pipetting is always done with appropriate equipment. Contaminated pipette tips are    collected and discarded into the S1 waste bin.
11. Injuries and all other incidences have to be reported immediately.
12. Female students have to notify the course supervisor immediately if pregnancy is    confirmed to prevent working with hazardous substances and redesign of the lab work    so that a safe participation of the lab course can be ensured.
Public safety : NO. Because there is no public access to the institute.
Environmental safety : NO. All the waste is disposed off by following the safety guidelines. The waste is appropriately treated before diposal.
2.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
YES,
3.What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Our project was presented to the Director of the institute, Dean of the masters course and some other group leaders who are responsible for the management and safety of the institute. Among all these discussions and presentations, no safety concerns were raised. The concept of our project as well as the execution of the work raised no biosafety issues.
4.Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
NO
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
