28th September’09:
1. A restriction digest of TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR has been done with PvuII.
2. Colonies from pRhaFlp-CmR-kanR are sub-cultured in LB-Kan-Cm solution and incubated overnight.
29th September’09:
1. Cultures from pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP and TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR are inoculated and incubated for miniprep next day.
2. The restriction digest of TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR is run on a gel and the insert is gel purified.
3. The restriction digest for Fosmid-SpecR is also run on a gel to check the quality of digest.
30th September’09:
1. Minipreps of pF3-ZeoR-F3-RFP and TT-FRT-GFP-BsdR have been done followed by a restriction digest with XhoI, HindIII, PvuII and BspEI respectively for concerned samples.
2. The concentrations of the midiprep for pRhaFlp-CmR.KanR have been measured.
