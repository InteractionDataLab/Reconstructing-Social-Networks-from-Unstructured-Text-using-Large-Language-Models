1st October
The concentration of the previous minis was very low, so mini prep was repeated. Again measured concentration were found to be right. These would be digested tomorrow.
Red/ET for insertion of F3-Zeo-F3-RFP into pTet-Flp-KanR and pRhaFlp-CmR-KanR:
-overnight cultures were set up by picking 2 colonies from the GB2005-DIR plate.  -These colonies were inoculated into 2 tubes containing 1.4 ml LB each kept o/n @ 37°, 1000 rpm.
Red/ET for insertion of FRT-GFP-BsdR into the Fosmid-SpecR: Cultures were set up.
2nd October Red/ET recombination was done for:
1. pTetFlp-KanR-CmR + F3-ZeoR-F3-RFP
2. Fosmid-SpecR +FRT-GFP-BsdR
These were induced using L-Arabinose. The samples are plated as following:
-pTetFlp-KanR-CmR + F3-ZeoR-F3-RFP         Kan plate and kan + Zeo plate (in duplicate)  -pTetFlpKanR - no insert    kan, Zeo+kan  -Fosmid-SpecR+FRT-GFP-BsdR   Bsd, Bsd+Spec  -Fosmid-SpecR-no insert    Bsd, Bsd+Spec
All plates incubated at 30° C o/n  The GB2005-DIR and GB2005-Red cells were plated on LB and kept at 37° C o/n.
The #1 to#24  (from 1st oct) were digested as follows:
sample #1 and #2 (F3-Zeo-F3-RFP): by XhoI
sample #3 to #8 (FRT-GFP-BsdR): by HincII
sample #9 to #17 (pMA-FRT-dhfr) and #18 to #24 (pRha-Flp-CmRKanR): by PvuII
3rd October The plates in the 37°C, incubator (GB2005-Red & GB2005-DIR) were kept in the fridge.
The other plates   -pTetFlp-kanR+F3-Zeo-F3 RFP  -Fosmid-Spec+FRT-GFP-BsdR  did not have any colonies, so they were kept @30° C for another day.
