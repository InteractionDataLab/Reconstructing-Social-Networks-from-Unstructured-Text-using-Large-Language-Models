Nucleation of silver nanoparticles on AG4 - Methods
There is an abundance of protocols for the formation of silver nanoparticles. After many attempts we decided to adapt method [1] employing sodium ascorbate as chemical reductant ti aid the formation process. the Pipeting scheme for the setup is shown below.
120 ul peptide (AG4)(8ug/ul)
14 ul NaAsc. at 2mM
1.4 ul AgNO3 at 20mM
4.6 ul H2O
In the negative control AG4 was replaced by water. The absorption of the sample and the negative control were measured after 21 hours.
Finally, the particles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.
