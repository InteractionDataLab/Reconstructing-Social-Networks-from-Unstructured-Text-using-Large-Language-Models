A First Introduction - Dr. Ding's One Summer
Do you want to enjoy more sunshine rather than fail and fail again in lab?
Do you want to design a biological system with computers rather than by thinking day and night?
Do you want to have more reasonable plans rather than an uncertain one for your experiments?
Follow Dr. Ding , our ABCD will try to make your dreams come true.
Wait!It would be much more efficient to get some general ideas about our ABCD firstly: Mathematical Model , Design Level , Design Type .
Now, tell ABCD what you want. There are different ways for you to Input your desired dynamics to ABCD.
Are there any restrictions on this biological network that happen to meet your needs? Good news! Dr. Ding will tell you how to complete this in ABCD.
Our ABCD engine starts working. The state of art algorithms we implement in ABCD will make design process automatically and different feasible solutions will be generated.
How can you find real components to construct the system. Thanks to BioBricks . Our database makes it possible to retrieve them while some new standards should be proposed.
Also, if our memory serves right, there are quite a few brilliant software packages specified at BioBrick organizing and related management, for example, Clotho from Berkeley's dry team, 2008. If combined with these softwares, the construction will be even more applicable.
Now, you may feel happy to realize a function such as oscillation , perfect adaptation or bistability following our solutions. But we still hold earnest expectations. Is it possible to complete the fabrication automatically in the future ?
