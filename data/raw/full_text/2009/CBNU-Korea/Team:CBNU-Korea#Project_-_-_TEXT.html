Essarker: An Essential Remarker for a Minimal for Synthetic Genome
It is challengeable to create a synthetic genome for fulfilling the needs of energy and food. Without the assistance of computing tools, moreover, it would be much more difficult to make the synthetic genome. We here propose a key tool to help the creation of a genome as the essential step. The goal of Essarker is to help users design a minimal genome synthesized through the fundamental frame comprising the essential genes of replication. Essarker is a standalone software to manage and retrieve required sequences of genomes, and explore the essential gene order and direction and the related orthologous genes. It also identifies and visualizes the positions and orientations of genes. In addition, it shows optimal ordering of essential genes and orthologs by statistical analysis.
Project Details
--Goal for Essarker System--
To manage and retrieve required data and explore informations
--- through mapping essential gens into orthologs of interesting genomes
--- and through statistical analyses of gene order and direction, so on
--Ortholog Clustering--
Clustering Orthologs from selected prokaryotes using ReMark software
--- The ReMark tool will be made to be fully automatic
--- implemented by python programming language
Producing scoring matrix directly among the complete genomes by empolying BLAST
-- We are creating a program --

This is the input screen. Can add new material when found. The new version of the name, location, description, type and direction will be added when the screen in real time
Any information entered in this screen. As you can see on the screen gene name, location, relative size, direction is displayed.
This gene is present, type the name of the character descriptions are expressed in the direction of the screen.
If you add new information or changes to save the newly added features stored.
