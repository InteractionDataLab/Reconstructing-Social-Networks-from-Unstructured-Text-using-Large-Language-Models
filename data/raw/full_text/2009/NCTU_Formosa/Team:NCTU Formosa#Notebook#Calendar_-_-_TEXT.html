July
7/15
It is the beginning today!!!!!!!!
7/17
Lesson：Parts, Devices and Biobricks.  In this lesson we learned about the principle of the construction of biobricks.
7/20~22
To present 2008 IGEM projects.
7/27~29
To present everyone’s primary idea.
August
8/03
A group duscussion of each one's personal idea.
8/05
To collate everyone’s advantages.
8/07
A group discussion.   We decided what kind of projects we're going to construct.
8/12
A group discussion.  We discussed about the principle and some details of the project.                         We also designed the first step of the experimence and the protocols.
8/17
Today we devided our team into 5 subgroups and started the experimence.   In each subgroup,                        we have to contribute a part of the whole project.
8/18
We transformed the bricks we need from the well.
8/21
we check DNA by agarose gel, SDS-PAGE.
8/22~23
To transfer E. coli to new LB broth, and incubate for 16hr, then Extract plasmid.
8/28
we design a logo of team NCTU_FORMOSA
September
9/1
The experiment is not so smoothly, we sink into infinite loop in the same experiments.
9/2
To digest the front part (8/23) and the behind part (8/26) of the biobrick, ligate, transform and run gel to check that if digestion is OK or not, then spread on the plate, and incubate for 20hr.
9/7
We use another enzyme to digest to double check if the plasmid is right or not
9/10
Today we have a meeting that we discuss how to solve the problems.
9/14~25
The plasmid's sequences are wrong and we repeat the digestion, ligation, and transform again.
9/16
BBa_K188343 is sequenced today.
9/28
Degenerated PCR, using BBa_K145279 as template
9/29
Degenerated PCR
October
10/2
Degenerated PCR. Restriction enzyme map.
10/7
Gel purification. To ligate gel purification products
10/11
to make restriction enzyme map. To select 14 plasmids
10/12
We had a team work to work on the wiki web. Flow cytometer.
10/14
Submitted the parts to be sequenced.
10/18
Updated the web of notebook and the project.   We also had a group discussion about our results and the data.
10/21
To discuss our final result.
