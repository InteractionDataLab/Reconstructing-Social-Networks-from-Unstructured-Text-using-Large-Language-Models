Abstract
Bacterial referee with  adjustable timer and counter functions
Our team constructed a controllable synthetic genetic circuit in Escherichia coli which serve as timer and counter functions.  The circuit works as an OR gate to integrate temporal and environmental signals.
The output (red fluorescent protein: RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON.  The timer function is controlled by Lac promoter, and the concentration of lactose determines timer’s working length.  After E.coli consume the added lactose, the RFP will be translated to remind us that time’s up.
The counter function can detect the bacteria population with LuxI/LuxR device.  Moreover, sensitivity of the counter is controlled by the strength of TetR repressible promoter.  If external bacteria invade the system, the extra AHL produced will induce the RFP translation to warn us ofcontamination.  Our project may create a new way on food storage, an innovative type of contact lens or wound dressing.
Fig. 1 The bacterial referee system works as an OR gate that can integrate temporal and environmental signals. The inputs of the modular genetic OR gate are the concentration of lactose and acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). The chemicals represent the signals from timer and counter functions . The output (RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON. Therefore, the media turn from green color to yellow color (mixed color of green and red light), yellow color to red color step by step.
