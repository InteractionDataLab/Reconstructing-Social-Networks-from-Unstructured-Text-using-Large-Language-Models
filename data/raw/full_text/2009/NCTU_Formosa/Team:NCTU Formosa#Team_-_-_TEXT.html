You can also call me Cloudy. Now I am the senior student of National Chiao-Tung  University and I major in biological science and technology.
Before the  project, I researched in tolerance of Escherichia  coli and cellulose degradation. I  am glad to join this project with my teammates. Since we came from different  background, we were able to contribute various perspectives and to work more  efficiently.
It is a new challenge for  me. Thus, the  opportunity of this competition will improve me a lot.

Chia-Wei Zheng
I’m JOY. I’m a junior student of National Chiao-Tung University and I major in Biological Science and Technology. It’s a big challenge for me to join this genetically engineered competition and I believe I will learn a lot in the process.
In my leisure time, I usually go playing volleyball. It’s my favorite sport. Also, I like to listen to music, especially some taiwanese underground bands such as Tizzy Bac.
I’m exciting about the game, aren’t you? Hope everyone will have fun and enjoy it! GOOD LUCK!

Tseng En-Jung
I’m an undergraduate student and major in biotechnology. I am very glad to join in 2009 NCTU_Formosa iGEM team in my last semester in collage. Although my research in undergraduate is heart diseases, different from what the team do now. However, this training let me know another way to think of synthetic biology. I hope I will learn more design thoughts and use the thoughts in my future studies.
