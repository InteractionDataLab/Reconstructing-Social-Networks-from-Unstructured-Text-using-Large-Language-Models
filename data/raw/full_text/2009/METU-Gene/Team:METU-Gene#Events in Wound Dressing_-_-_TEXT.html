Events in Wound Dressing
From 2009.igem.org
(Redirected from Team:METU-Gene/Events in Wound Dressing )
Upper Side
RED EVENT : Introduction of Oxygen into wound dressing is performed via pores of  polyurethane.  Oxygen induction activates Human epidermal growth factor synthesis in E. Coli colony 1.
PURPLE EVENT : hEGF proteins fuse the second polyurethane layer and reach the gelation sponge.  While gelatin sponge is biologically degraded on wounds, Hegf proteins reach the wound  and contribute to proliferation of cells  by accelerating  the speed  of cell divisions.  Meanwhile, AI-2, the quorum sensing molecules of colony 1, activates synthesis of Human keratinocyte growth factor(hKGF).
LIGHT GREEN EVENT: The synthesis of hKGF is performed by the effects of AI-2 on colony-2. Human keratinocyte growth factor fuses the second polyurethane layer and follows the same  pathway of hEGF proteins which causes the migration of cells in the wounds. At the same time, Aı-2 proteins of colony-1 starts the synthesis of AHL(homoserine lactone).
BLACK EVENT: The synthesis of homoserine lactone (AHL)  is provided by colony-2 . AHL proteins fuse with available LuxR proteins and activate the lysis pathways of both colony -1 and colony-2.
Down Side
GRAY EVENT: Biological degradation of gelatin sponge inhibits the protease activity in wounds. Inhibition of proteases provide prolonged  activity of hEGF, hKGF and granulysin proteins.
DARK GREEN EVENT: Biodegradable  gelatin sponge contains  granulysin  antimicrobial proteins.  While the gelatin sponge is degraded, granulysin proteins  spread to the wound and kill both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.  The other advantage of granulysin protein is  being antitumor factor. Granulysin protein  fastens the inflammatory  phase of  wound healing.
