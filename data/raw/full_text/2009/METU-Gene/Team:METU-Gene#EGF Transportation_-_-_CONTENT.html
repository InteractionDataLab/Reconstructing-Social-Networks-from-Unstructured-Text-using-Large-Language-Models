E. coli harboring the PrtDEF of E. chrysanthemi secreted more fusion proteins than without ABC transporter. In fact, in enzyme activation assay(with Hitachi Spectrophotometer) we observed that although our protein -EGF- has disulfide bonds, it was excreted succesfully. In addition, when compearing with lack of ABC domain, we saw that protein excretion into medium (supernatant) is 10-fold more with ABC transporter-PrtDEF-. PrtDEF functioned well at 37°C, the optimum growth temperature for E. coli.
In our project Wound Dressing, for excretion of EGF and KGF into supernatant,we used the plasmid.It is a device which contains three genes-prtD,prtE and prtF- in order to form ATP Binding Cassette(ABC) transporter domain on E.coli membrane.Thus,the plasmid is not used for digestion or ligation.The plasmid works with constutively on &quot;tetR&quot; promoter.

bond approaches the channel entrance, is recognized by the secretion machinery (PrtD), but cannot go across the channel. (B) Proteins are
stacked inside the channel during secretion. Disulfide bonds may be formed at this stage. (C)Inclusion body formations of protein can not enter into the domain nor pass through the domain.

</P><P>ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter secretes the protein through inner and outer membranes simultaneously in gram negative bacteria. Thermostable lipase (TliA)  is secreted through the ABC transporter. 
TliA  has four glycine rich repeats (GGXGXD) in its C-terminus, which appear in many ABC transporter-secreted proteins. Whole TliA is the longest LARD.
Lipase ABC transporter domains (LARDs) were designed for the secretion of fusion proteins.
Result of our experiment
There was TliA-AbC in the LB Agar+Chm+Amp+Try plate so lipase reacted with tributyrin and butyric acid was formed. As a result of this, we have seen the zone formation.
</P><P>
We  holed 3mm zone in the plate and we poured the supernatant. 2 of them was including E.coli with ABC-transporter and 2 of them did not contain.  After that we left these plates in incubation at 25 C for 2 days. 
</P><PRE>As we expected, area of zone in plate with ABC transporter is larger than the without ABC transporter.

Lipase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as a substrate. Ten millimolar pNPP dissolved in acetonitrile was mixed with ethanol and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) to a final ratio of acetonitrile:ethanol:Tris-HCl of 1:4:95 (v/v/v). The reaction was started by adding 50 μl of culture supernatant to 200 μl of reaction mixture at 42°C, and absorbance at 420 nm was monitored with a Hitachi spectrophotometer (Enzyme Kinetic Activity Assay)

To identify a secretion phenotype on solid medium, E. coli
was grown at 25°C for 48 h on LAT (LB medium, 1.5%
Bacto Agar, 0.5% tributylin). The phenotype was evident
by the development of a halo due to the secreted lipase
[12]. In addition, lipase activity was measured spectrophotometrically
using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as
a substrate [12]. Ten millimolar pNPP dissolved in acetonitrile
was mixed with ethanol and 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.5) to a final ratio of acetonitrile:ethanol:Tris-HCl of
1:4:95 (v/v/v). The reaction was started by adding 50 μl of
culture supernatant to 200 μl of reaction mixture at 42°C,
and absorbance at 420 nm was monitored with Hitachi Spectrophotometry
for 20 min. The activity was measured by the increase of
optical density (OD).
