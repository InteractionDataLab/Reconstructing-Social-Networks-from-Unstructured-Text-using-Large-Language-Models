Inflammation Phase
Figure 1 : 2 days after injury.
Fastening the inflammatory phase will be dependent on the granulysin antimicrobial protein.  Granulysin prevents any invasion of bacteria which have pathogen activity on the wound. Eliminating the tumors via osmolytic lysis is one of the granulysin’s properties.
In addition,in our Wound Dressing project, we used Granulysin to sterilize the environment against all type of bacteria. In addition, in case of distortion of our biomaterial grade dressing, our Ecoli may infact with wounds. Because of that reason, in order to prevent wounds from pathogenicity of E.coli, granulysin protein which will be integrated into gelatin sponge of our dressing to kill our bacteria.
Proliferative Phase
Figure 2 : 17 days after injury.
hEGF plays  a major role in the proliferative phase. It causes rapid cell division occur in the wounded area. However, rapid cell division may induce cancer in the wounded area. By switching mechanism with oxygen promoter and lysis cassette, the synthesis of hEGF is controlled and the risk for cancer minimized.
The Epidermal Growth Factor(EGF).As we all know, it has a big role in wound healing.Moreover, it has also a function to start the formation of keratin and to stimulate cell division. It can also increase the amount of nucleic acids.And, it causes the storage of glikozamin and glikozaminoglikan.
Remodelling phase
Figure 3 : 30 days after injury.
The main role of hKGF is providing migration of the produced cells  to the wounded area . By this effect, both wound healing time and the risk for cancer diminished.    KGF(Keratinocyte Growth Factor) is composed of 194 aminoacids and has a function to renew epitel tissue in healing period. However, it is not observed to cause any effect on cell differentiaiton.It speeds up the healing process.
