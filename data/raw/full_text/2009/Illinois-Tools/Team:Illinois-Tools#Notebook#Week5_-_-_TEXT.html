During this week I put a lot of focus into writing code to update our database. Eventually, we will be able to re-use some of this code in an automated process that keeps our network up to date with the Kegg database.

This week I worked through the Django tutorials and learned how to make databases using Django and SQLite. I began creating models for the categories of databases that we would need. We went through many of the KEGG files to determine the way that we are going to organize our databases.
