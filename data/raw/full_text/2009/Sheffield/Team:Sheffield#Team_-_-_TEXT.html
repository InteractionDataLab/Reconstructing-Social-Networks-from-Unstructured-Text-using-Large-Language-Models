ALL ABOUT US
Hello there, be my guest as I give you a quick peep at my team. It all started in early July when all interested candidates were asked to gather up for a meeting regarding iGEM and eventually 7 students showed up. As time passed by the number decreased exponentially and now we are left with 3 team members. And may I not officially but rationally declare us as the smallest iGEM team for 2009. That does not mean we are any weaker as each member’s workmanship, enthusiasm and self believe cannot be doubted but driven towards a successful iGEM team.
We are supported by various personalities from different department in the university. Their combined knowledge and advice is always’ well appreciated and as well; makes us a much stronger integrity.
HOW WE OPERATE
The two main heads of the project are Professor Philip Wright and Professor Visakan Kadirkamanathan. Any main issues regarding the project are dealt by them. Then comes the supportive postgrads; Jagrob Pandhal and Josselin Noirel who help us out in the biology based aspects, while Tara Baldacchino covers the modelling bit.
