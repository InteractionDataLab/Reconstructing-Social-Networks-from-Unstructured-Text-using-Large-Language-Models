Project abstract
In the long run our crude oil resources will be on the decline but most importantly the effects of the climate change demand a quick shift to a sustainable fuel economy. Approaching biofuel production by direct synthesis from sunlight has the potential to solve the problems that arise with the conventional fermentation of starches and sugars such as the direct competition of fuel feedstock with food crops. Thus the Uppsala iGEM Team 2009 investigated the production of ethanol and butanol with the use of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp PCC6803. Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria possess the ability to directly convert sunlight into biofuels. We engineered constructs for ethanol and butanol production as well as strategies to increase the yields of photosynthetic ethanol production.
