Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety: NO
public safety, or : NO
environmental safety? : NO
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? YES
What does your local biosafety group think about your project? Unknown, will be stated at the Jamboree (poster, presentation)
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?  NO
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? /
When we say no, we mean no but in terms of probability there is no "no". Because as we deal with biology there is always the chance that something does not behave as expected. However we believe that with more than 99,999999999999999999% our project is safe if the prevalent security and safety norms are followed.
