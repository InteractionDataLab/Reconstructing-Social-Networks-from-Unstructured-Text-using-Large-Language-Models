Welcome!
The Utah State University team is happy to have received a GOLD MEDAL at the 2009 iGEM Jamboree. We are very proud of all that we were able to accomplish this year. We invite you to explore our site and learn all about our project! And please contact us if you would like more information about any aspect of our project.
The aim of the Utah State University iGEM project is to develop improved production and harvesting methods of proteins and other products in multiple organisms using the standardized BioBrick system. The name of our project, BioBricks without Borders, characterizes and ties together the two main focuses of our research:
Investigating broad host-range vectors for production of compounds in organisms other than E. coli (like Synechocystis PCC6803, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Pseduomonas putida)
Developing a library of fusion-compatible BioBrick parts for targeting compounds for secretion
