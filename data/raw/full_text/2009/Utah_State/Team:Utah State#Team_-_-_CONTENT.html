Located in <A href="http://www.loganutah.org/"><B><FONT color="#009900">Logan, Utah</FONT></B></A>, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah State University sits just outside the mouth of Logan Canyon. The city, founded in 1859, has a population of approximately 47,000 and boasts a rich heritage. Whether on campus, historic Main Street, down in the “island”, or up the canyon, there is always something to do. 
</P><P class="class">
Originally founded in 1888 as the Agricultural College of Utah, the school officially became a university in 1957. As the state's land-and space-grant university, USU conducts world-class research in many disciplines and has several projects in conjunction with the Department of Defense and NASA. USU’s research program is second in age only to MIT in the United States. USU's <A href="http://www.sdl.usu.edu/index-noflash.html"><B><FONT color="#009900">Space Dynamics Laboratory</FONT></B></A> has put more experiments into space than any university in the world and is ranked first in the United States for funding for aerospace research. 
</P><P class="class">The <A href="http://www.engineering.usu.edu"><B><FONT color="#009900">engineering</FONT></B></A> program at Utah State is known for its excellence, with a 96% first-time pass rate on the national engineering exam compared to a national average of 55%. Beyond the Logan campus, Utah State's Extension programs extend academic resources and support throughout the entire state of Utah, having extension locations in each of Utah's 29 counties.</P><P class="class"><A href="http://www.bie.usu.edu/"><B><FONT color="#009900">Biological and Irrigation Engineering</FONT></B></A> is a relatively small department at Utah State, with about 30 faculty and 120 undergraduate and graduate students. This great student-to-teacher ratio helps students succeed in their classes. The Biological Engineering Program teaches students to manipulate biological systems for useful purposes, understand scientific literature, and to work well and communicate effectively with others, both in the field of Biological Engineering and out. In the first years of the program, students learn the basics of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. This knowledge base is then broadened by a study of liberal arts and humanities including literature, philosophy, political science, art, and music classes. Students finally delve into technical engineering courses, many chosen personally by students to apply to their particular areas of interest. These courses develop practical problem-solving abilities, increasing sensitivity to the economic, social, and legal dimensions of technical problems. Students leave the program well-qualified for their careers, with an understanding of the importance of social and professional ethics and responsibility to accompany their technical learning. After graduation, students will apply their knowledge to a wide range of careers, from genetic engineering to design of prosthetic devices for amputees.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" style="background:#CCCCCC; padding:7px; border-style:none"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV align="center"><B><A href="#top"><FONT size="3" face="Century Gothic, Arial, San Serif" color="#000033">Go to Top of Page</FONT></A></B></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="printfooter">
