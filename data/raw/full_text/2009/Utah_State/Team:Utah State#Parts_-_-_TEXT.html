BioBricks
The USU iGEM team has successfully constructed 49 BioBrick parts and devices. Of these, we have had time to demonstrate the functionality of 8 BioBricks, and had 41 of them sequenced. Check out our BioBrick Registry page to see all of these parts and to find more detailed information about them. The following figures shows all of the potential different combinations of pieces used to make composite devices for this project.
