Future Work
Resolve problems with conversion of broad-host range vectors to BioBrick compatible formats.
Further test the broad-host vectors to verify their functionality in additional organisms.
Further test different GFP and phasin constructs and determine additional ways to monitor phasin production, such as by mass spectrometry or transmission electron microscopy.
Design additional signal peptides that are functional with organisms like Synechocystis PCC6803, P. putida, and R. sphaeroides, and that can be expressed in BioBrick-compatible broad-host range vectors.
Optimize and expand both systems to include different protein products and organisms.
