[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Dilutions of the liquid cultures of ligX (7/09) were made and put in 37°C to grow during the day.
In the evening the liquid cultures were first put in 16°C and then put under light.
The miniprep of LigX was not performed correctly.
Liquid cultures of  were made.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Restriction digest on EF1, EF2, EF3 and EF4
Gel electrophoresis of digestion, result: EF1 and EF3 appear to have an insert. The insert of EF4 is too short, between 1500 and 2000 bp (might just be ech) and EF2 appears to have been cut by only 1 enzyme
Also, restriction digest overnight results in an extra very weak intensity band at 600 and one between 1500 and 2000 bp
This result has been seen before on just ech. It might be due to an extra restriction site on the ech gene. The two bands could result from this same band. The addition of both bands would then be the same as the insert.
Electroporation of SAMS1 and SAMS2
Glycerolstock for sam5, sam8, ech and fcs
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
restriction digest of A and puc were done
overnight ligation of puc and A
