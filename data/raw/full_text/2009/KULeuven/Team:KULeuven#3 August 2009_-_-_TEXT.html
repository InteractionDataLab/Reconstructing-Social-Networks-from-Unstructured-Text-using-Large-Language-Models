[ edit ] Vanillin Production
We received the COMT, sam5 and sam8 from Edinburgh today. Unfortunately, the tube containing the sam5 + RBS (with the PstI site) was opened during transport and all DNA in it was lost. The others were transferred into competent cells by electroporation.
sam5 + RBS in  (with PstI site removed),
sam8 + RBS in ,
sam8 in  coding sequence,
COMT in  coding sequence,
The cells were put into liquid LB to recuperate from the procedure, transferred onto LB/amp plates and grown overnight at 37°C.
We also made liquid cultures of the RBS + fcs and RBS + ech cultures so we can miniprep them tomorrow.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain pTiA6NC/A1011 was plated out on LB-medium.
Primers for virA, virG, promotor region virB and RpoA have arrived
