Key Lock Antikey
Overview
The Key and Antikey system performs a subtraction of the blue light signal and the vanillin receptor signal. The result controls the vanillin production. The biology behind the subtraction involves the annealing of complementary RNA strands, the Key and the Antikey. This reaction is favoured over the reaction between the Key and the Lock leading to vanillin synthesis. In this way we try to perform the subtraction before inducing production of vanillin.
