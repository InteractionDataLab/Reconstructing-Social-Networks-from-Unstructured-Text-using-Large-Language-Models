Dry Lab
Over the last few days the blue light sensor, and the vanillin production were modeled in simbiology from mathworks. Most of the kinetic parameters are unknown.
Project
The Vanillin Receptor is not usable, Madrid also tried and ran into all sorts of problems: Problems span from the binding of the periplasmic protein to the vanillin molecule, to the function of the fusion protein, to the activation of the ompR.
There are two solutions to this problem:
Construct a different vanillin receptor
Using VirA/VirG, a phenol receptor in agrobacterium .
Detect an alternative substance that has a linear relationship with the vanillin concentration
Vanillin inhibits the Ahl receptor
Synthesis of another signaling molecule that could be sensed
