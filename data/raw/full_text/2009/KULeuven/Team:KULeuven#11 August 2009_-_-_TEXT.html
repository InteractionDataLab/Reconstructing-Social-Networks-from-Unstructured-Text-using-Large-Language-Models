Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Restriction digest
cut with EcoRI and SpeI, incubation for 1,5 hour
Gel electrophoresis of
The cut piece should be 109 bp
Restriction digest
Electroporation of parts - and  in electrocompetent cells
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
There was no growth of sam8/sam5, fcs/ech and COMT plates.
Possible reason is a problem with the electrocompetent cells
Or the concentration of sam5/sam8 is too low
Plan for tomorrow is to create new electrocompetent cells
Prepared LB and glycerol today
Made liquid cultures sam8, sam5, fcs and ech
Made new agarplates with Ampicilin
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
We also received another strain of Agrobacterium. We brought this new strain in culture.
To make things clear the genes from the first Agrobacterium will from now on be called A,B,G and R for respectively virA, promotor region virB , virG and rpoA. For the second Agrobacterium we will use W,X,Y and Z to indicate the same genes.
We achieved good results for genes B,G and R. There were clear white colonies after plating the competent cells with the TOPO vector on X-gal agar plates with ampicillin. We isolated the good colonies again.
There was no result for A. This was probably due to a fault with the competent cells. So we started TOPO transformation by heatshock all over for A.
