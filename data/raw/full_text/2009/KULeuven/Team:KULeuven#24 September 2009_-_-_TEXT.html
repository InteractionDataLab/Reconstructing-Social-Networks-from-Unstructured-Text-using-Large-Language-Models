Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
following the conclusions made on 23/09 a new experiment was set up:
liquid cultures were ented (and reented in the evening) and grown on two different temperatures: 37° and 25°.
from each of these growth conditions some of the cultures were put in 16° and the other at 25°. each of these groups were then again divided in a group that was lit with blue light and a group that wasn't.
this was done for our ligation of blp with GFP in three different vector (pSB3K3, pBR322 and pSB1A2)
an example of a sample name is: 37/16/NB/LigA, grown at 37°, put in 16°, not lit and in vector pSB1A2.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Made motherplate of PAMSCO
restriction digest of PAMSCO with E/S
Gel extraction PAMSCO restriction digest
Restriction digest of Terminator and EFT with E/X
Ligation of PAMSCO with TER --> PAMSCOT
LIgation of PAMSCO with EFT --> PAMSCOEFT
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Again there was no cutting seen on the two samples of virA so we just started electroporation and we hoped with sequencing later one we could see if it was well mutagenated.
