[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Miniprep of pairs:
RBS + sam5 conc: 101,3 ng/ul
RBS + sam8 conc: 95.7 ng/ul
sam8 conc: 81,8 ng/ul
COMT , conc: 122,9 ng/ul
Restriction digestion
A1: sam8, EcoRI en SpeI
A2: sam5, EcoRI en XbaI
B1: RBS, EcoRI en SpeI
B2: COMT, EcoRI en XbaI
C1: fcs, EcoRI en SpeI
C2: ech, EcoRI en XbaI
The mixture was incubated in 37°C for 1h30...
...followed by gel electrophoresis of the digested parts
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Gel electrophoresis was done to see if PCR has worked. VirA, virB and rpoA showed a clear result. We performed miniprep on those genes to purify and clear them. VirG didn't show any result.
We did a new PCR for all the genes and especially for virG with a better annealing temperature. The gel electrophoresis showed a good and clear result for all the genes.
