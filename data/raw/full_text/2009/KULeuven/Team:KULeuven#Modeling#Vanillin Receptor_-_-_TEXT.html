Simulation
A scan of the influence of vanillin on the production of Anti Key is shown is the figure below. The steady state level of Anti Key is quite linearly dependent on the amount vanillin, a half rise time of 3 hours is estimated by this simulation.
The concentration of vanillin [µM] regulates the production mRNA AntiKey
Vanillin diffusion
Because VirA senses the vanillin concentration in the cytoplasm, it's important to estimate the diffusion of vanillin over the cell membrane. Also because vanillin is not actively removed from the extracellular medium, the rate of evaporation of vanillin is an important figure if we want to regulate the concentration of vanillin in the extracellular medium. A detailed analysis can be found in following document. vanillin_sensing
The most important figures are that the time to reach steady state between the concentration of the inter and extracellular concentration of vanillin in the order of 10 ms, the half-life through evaporation of vanillin in water  is 20 hours.
An equivalent model (single cell) of vanillin in the aqueous medium and evaporation was conducted.
Following simulation shows the time-scale of evaporation of vanillin out of the lb(aqueous) medium, the slow evaporation rate of vanillin is not surprising considering its use in the perfume industries as an aroma in the ground note.
Evaporation rate of vanillin out of lb medium
If this evaporation rate would show to slow, several active techniques exists to speed the process of removing the vanillin from the extracellular medium.
