[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Transfer of the plates with cells from the ligation: 20 colonies have been transferred to a new plate to achieve more single colonies
Plating of  from -80°C
Electroporation of the blue light promotor ligation (with ) in new competent cells
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Gel extraction of the 4 lanes from sam8 () and ech ()
To test an additional blanc, we extracted a blanc piece of gel
Nanodrop results were done with the conventional blanc (just elution buffer) and with the extracted blanco gel. However, since the results between both varied too much and the extracted blanco gel was not significantly better, we decided to use the conventional blanco in order to compare between former nanodrop measurements

Ligation of ech and fcs. For fcs we took the digest from last week (C1), because this week's restriction digest had a very low concentration (4,2) and a very high 260/280 (6,08)

Inoculate 2 and 3 and grow on ....
TOPO from W and Z and again from A
Note: if A fails again (with the iGEM protocol) then proceed with a new PCR purification.
Mutagenesis 1 on position 202 of R was performed
