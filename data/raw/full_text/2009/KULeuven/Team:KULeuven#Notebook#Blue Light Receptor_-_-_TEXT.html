A restriction digest was performed to cut the plasmid with EcoRI and XbaI
A mixture of 20μl was made(3x):6μl DNA, 2μl bufferH, 1μl EcoRI and 1μl XbaI, 10μl AD
The mixture was incubated for at least an hour at 37°C

The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37°C
After the restriction digests, the products had to be checked for their length. So, an agarose gel was run for both the cut GFP-plasmids and the cut promoter region. A photograph was taken and following conclusions were made:
Plasmids with GFP appeared to have cut decently
Promoter region: the partial digestion did not seem to have done the trick. We only found a lane around 360 bp while we expected to find another lane just under 200 bp due to cutting at the "forbidden" SpeI site in the middle. As we did not find this lane in our gel we concluded that SpeI probably did not cut. This might be because it was diluted too much or because we did not incubate long enough.
We concluded to purify both the plasmids and the promoter region through gel extraction.  After nanodropping, we had these results:
Plasmids:
Concentration: 22ng/µl
260/280: 1,83
Promoter region (two samples):
Concentration: 31,7ng/µl and 32,7ng/µl
260/280: 1,84 and 2,06
The conclusion of the day was to redo a partial digestion on the promoter regions, this time under different conditions (longer incubation time and less diluted). At the same time a Knelow technique would be used on the newly PCR-ed promoter region in order to cut out the SpeI site.
Later that evening we received an email from Regine Hengge (co-author on the article The BLUF-EAL protein YcgF acts as a direct anti-repressor in a blue-light response of Escherichia coli ). This contained valuable information about the location of the actual promoter in our purified region.

The plates with ligation A (blp + GFP) were fetched from the blue light installation. There was no GFP signal. The following actions will be taken:
The plasmids will be purified from the colonies and will be sequenced using primer 2260.
Next time, we will probably put them in liquid cultures under the LED's while shaking gently. Also, other parameters that need to be considered are being researched.
They will not be exposed to the light as long anymore. We decided that 1h will be more than enough.
Possible bleaching?
A colony from all three plates with the LigA-construct was taken and ented in liquid culture. This was needed to check whether the colonies were still alive.

LigC ( + ) did not grow. we figured that an insert of 35bp was too short to ligate so we decided to use  as insert and  +  as vector . The following restriction digest was started:
was cut with SpeI and PstI
was cut with XbaI and PstI
The miniprep that was made to sequence the LigA construct on 26/08 was used again to perform a restriction digest (EcoRI and PstI). This was put on gel to check whether there actually was LigA-insert in the vector and whether the insert had the right length. The gel showed a signal at 1000 bp and at 2000 bp which coincides with the insert (BLp + GFP) and the vector.
A new setup to light the E.coli was engineered.
Fresh cultures were made from the old ones (LB plate ligA 14/08 and the two liquid cultures from 26/08 were used as templates.)
They were put in the 16°C room for about an hour
A blue light (40W) was put on them for about an hour

Gel electrophoresis of  miniprep and of restriction digest from 27/08 ( and . There was an unexpected signal at 800bp at the ( lanes. The conclusion was that this part can not be used and we have to start all over from the basic DNA to make this ligation C.
We checked our cultures that were radiated with blue light on 27/08.
The liquid cultures were put in the FACs machine. There was some fluorescence which is probably due to GFP. However, it can not be excluded that this is due to leakage from our promotor. So, a new set up needs to be made where decent controls are included.
The LB plates were put under a special GFP lamp. Just like the liquid cultures, there was signal but the same considerations need to be made.
A new plan was designed in order to make a permanent glycerol stock of LigA and to make a new set up for GFP measurements, this time including controls.
LigA and  were electroporated, plated and put overnight in the 37°C incubator.
was also plated starting from a glycerol stock and grown overnight at 37°.
The following was done over the weekend:
Saturday:
LigA grew well overnight. 4 colonies were selected for further testing and plated on new plates
The plates with  overgrew, so a single colony was picked and replated
The plates containing electroporated ligC from 26/08 had two colonies after all. These were ented in liquid cultures and grown overnight, so it can be checked later if these colonies do in fact contain ligC.
Sunday:
The 4 colonies that were selected on Saturday grew well and were ented in liquid cultures.
Some colonies from  were also ented in liquid culture.
Week 9: 31 August 2009 - 6 September 2009

LigA was plated on LB medium. This will be the "motherplate" from which the glycerol stock and the testing cultures will be taken from.
Electroporation of  in competent cells. It was plated and put overnight in the incubator.
In order to be able to grow vector , which contains the toxic ccdB gene, we need special cells which carry the gyrA462 mutation. This is strain DB3.1 from E.coli. These were plated and put in the incubator overnight.
[ edit ] Tuesday
Experimental set up for irradiation of LigA ( + )
Enting colonies from the motherplate:
4 agar plates with LigA = 2 for irradiation and 2 for control.
4 liquid cultures with LigA = 2 for irradiation and 2 for control.
4 agar plates with  = 2 for irradiation and 2 for control.
4 liquid cultures with  = 2 for irradiation and 2 for control.
There are two groups, each with 8 cultures.
Shift one: 2 agar plates and 2 liquid cultures with LigA and 2 agar plates and 2 liquid cultures with  were put in 16°C for one hour. After an hour, half of them were irradiated with blue light for an hour while the other have was wrapped in aluminium foil as a control. Afterwards they are put in the 37°C incubator for some time
Shift two: they were put in the 37°C for some hours so that the cultures can grow.
After measurement of the first shift the following was concluded:
Although the cells with  had a small signal after FACS, the plates showed no GFP when put under the lamp.
LigA that was not exposed to blue light had the same amount of signal as the construct that had been exposed. we assume that this is due to the exposure to white light when the cultures are exposed. Possibly, the promotor was then already activated since white light contains blue light frequencies. A new set up will be made over the weekend where all cultures will be made in a dark room.
Dilutions of the shift one liquid cultures were made + 2 new cultures from the motherplate from ligA. These were put overnight under blue light together with the cultures of shift 1
Following was ented in liquid culture:
LigA from motherplate

DB3.1
[ edit ] Wednesday
FACS measurements:
The cultures from shift 2 had similar results as shift one. However, the GFP signal measured from the LigA construct was stronger. Thus, cells definitely need to grow before undergoing irradiation.
The dilutions and the shift one cultures put overnight did not show any significant results.

After nanodropping,  was restricted with SpeI and PstI, while  was cut with PstI and XbaI.
A gel electrophoresis and extraction was performed. This showed an unexpected 800 bp signal at the lanes with . This is in fact due to the vector in which this part is ligated.  contains a reporter gene, RFP. Thus, in combination with the promotor, a construct is formed that can be used to measure activity of this promotor. Since the promotor is flanked by standard assembly restriction sites we can replace the current promotor () by any other promotor, for instance .
DB3.1,  and LigA were ented in liquid culture and grown overnight to make glycerol stocks and competent cells
[ edit ] Thursday
A restriction digest on  with EcoRI and SpeI was performed. This will cut the promotor out of its vector () which has a RFP reporter gene. We will put  (cut with EcoRI and SpeI) in this vector. This way we will get a construct where RFP will be produced dependant on our blue light promotor. We can then compare this with the intensity of RFP produced by .
Glycerol stock was made from LigA and . They are stored in the -80°C in S&P F8 67-68 and 69-70.

Since the results from our light experiments keep failing, some new ideas were computed. pSB1A2 is the backbone for our construct but since this is a high copy number plasmid perhaps the ratio of promotor to repressor is unequal (not enough repressor). A new enting in LC was done with ligX. These were grown for a few hours at 37°C and then put in 16°C room overnight so that more repressor can be made (its promotor is temperature-sensitive).
Ligation from 09/08 was electroporated in competent cells.
Miniprep of LigX, restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. The signals were good so a motherplate for ligX was made. Also, the vector pSB1A2 was extracted from the gel (39,1 ng/µl).

The electroporated ligY did not grow. A new restriction digest on pcr product  was performed with EcoRI and PstI.This was put on gel. There was a good signal so it was used to perform a ligation with vector pSB1A2.
A liquid culture that was made from pSB3K3 a few days ago showed growth after all. This was miniprepped and restriction digested to check whether the vector is actually present.
The liquid cultures with our blue light construct (lig) that stood overnight at 16°C was FACS-ed. Half of the cultures were exposed to blue light during the day and put under the FACS in the evening.

the restriction digest from saterday was put on gel and checked. all but one lane had good signal. a gel extraction was done with following results: ligA: 4,8ng/µl ; pBR322: 12,3ng/µl and pSB3K3: 14,3ng/µl (allw with good 260/280 values). pSB3K3 and ligA were used to perform a new ligation (likA)
the overenting of logA on tc/ap plates from saterday was succesfull. the cultures only grew on the tc plates.  the liquid cultures that were made from these logA's were miniprepped with following results: logA(1): 59,1ng/µl and logA(2): 91,5ng/µl. a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI was done and put on gel. the signal however showed that only one of the enzymes cut properly. the signal was however on the right height. a new restriction digest will be performed on monday.
a liquid culture of ligY mother plate was made for glycerol stock.
Week 12: 21 September 2009 - 27 September 2009
[ edit ] Monday
a new restriction digest on logA (1&2) was done.
the re-enting of likA was succesfull and the liquid culture was miniprepped. likA: 179,3 ng/µl. a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI was performed and put on gel. the signals were good.
a glycerol stock of ligY was made and some samples for sequencing were prepared.
a motherplate of LogA en LikA were made and liquid cultures to make a glycerol stock.
liquid cultures were also made for empty top10 cells, standard promotor  and LikA (blp and GFP in pSB3K3).
[ edit ] Tuesday
liquid cultures of LikA,  and the empty top10 cells were reented. 100µl was taken and put in new medium to get a dilution of 1/50. they grew during the day. in the evening these cultures were put in the 16°C room overnight.
[ edit ] Wednesday
measurements of the liquid cultures from 22/09 were made. the empty top10, and standard promoter I20260 were measured. then, at different times likA were measured.
we concluded the following from our measurements:
the gfp at time 0 was already pretty high
the level of gfp did not change during lighting.
the level of gfp measured was not higher then the gfp signal from I20260.
after having read some of the articles about this system again we made some new discoveries about the receptor (YcgF), the repressor (YcgE) and the promotor (blp):
temperature seems to be more important then we first suspected. not only does temperature influence the expression of YcgF/E but it also influences the dimerization of YcgF. It seems that the colder the temperature, the easier dimerization (in the absence of light) happens.
this finding made us conclude the following about temperatures in our experimental set up.
growing cells at 37°c: at this temperature the repressor has a very low expression rate. thus, the number of plasmids containing a promoter (15-30) is too big compared to the amount of repressor.
putting cells in 16°c: the amount of repressor produces might be enough to cover all the promoters but there will be at least as much receptor that is dimerized and tus active to undo this repression.
conclusion: growing aty 25° gives the possibility of creating enough repressor/receptor without having the receptor in an active state and removing the repressor activity.

following the conclusions made on 23/09 a new experiment was set up:
liquid cultures were ented (and reented in the evening) and grown on two different temperatures: 37° and 25°.
from each of these growth conditions some of the cultures were put in 16° and the other at 25°. each of these groups were then again divided in a group that was lit with blue light and a group that wasn't.
this was done for our ligation of blp with GFP in three different vector (pSB3K3, pBR322 and pSB1A2)
an example of a sample name is: 37/16/NB/LigA, grown at 37°, put in 16°, not lit and in vector pSB1A2.
[ edit ] Friday
measurement of the liquid culuters of 24/09:
at first glance it seemed that there was indeed repression of the promoter on 25°. further conclusions from the results could however not be made yet.
a new experiment will be done on tuesday the 29th with cultures that only grew on 25°C.

enting of ligA, LikA and LogA for measurementof the promoter activity when grown at 25°C
Week 13: 28 September 2009 - 4 October 2009
[ edit ] Monday
re enting of the cultures made on sunday (27/09)
[ edit ] Tuesday
we redid the experiment from 24/09 but only grew cultures at 25°C. we did split up the cultures into two groups, 16°c and 25°C and each group had some cultures that were lit and some dark.

Week 14: 5 October 2009 - 11 October 2009
[ edit ] Monday
liquid cultures of top10 I20260 standard promoter and our own construct (blp+gfp) were made.
[ edit ] Tuesday
the strenght of the promoter was tested following the protocol from the standard promoter measurement kit from iGEM. this can be found on the parts registry.
liquid cultures of blp+gfp in the pBR322 vector were made to redo our experiment.
[ edit ] Wednesday
experiment of 24/09 was repeated but the cultures were only grown and lit at 25°C. only the logA were used (in pBR322 vector) because its signal was clearer. In the previous measurement, we noticed that both the cells at 16°C and 25°C showed a higher GFP expression when irradiated with blue light, but we also noticed that because of the cold, the cultures grown at 16°C gave a higher GFP-expression even when they weren't irradiated.  That's why now, we only worked at Room temperature. Both growing overnight in the dark, and during the experiment, the cells were kept at room temperature.  We also noticed that a little cold shock could help our promotor start the GFP-production. The new overented cultures were made using a LB-medium kept at 4°C. This way, we obtained the best results.
