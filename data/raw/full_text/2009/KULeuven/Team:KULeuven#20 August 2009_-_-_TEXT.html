[ edit ] Vanillin Production
1)
EF colonies present! So, we took 1ml off for further growth and miniprepped the remaining 4ml in triple
Nanodrop concentrations:

We performed a digest with EcoRI and SpeI to cut out the insert and check it's length. Enzymes were added separately, with 1h in between. Total volume was 30µl.

In the afternoon, the remaining 1ml was re-plated and put on 37°C
2)
Test 1: Results from yesterday's restriction test were inconclusive, because the DNA ladder didn't run properly so the length of the fragments couldn't be read. Therefore, we did it again...
Restriction=OK! Test 1 completed.
3)
Test 2: cutting with 2 enzymes subsequently (1h incubation in between) in a volume of 30µl. Using a larger volume should dilute the glycerol, which inhibits cutting. After that, the products are incubated overnight to allow full restriction. sam8 and fcs are cut with EcoRI and SpeI; sam5 and ech are cut with EcoRI and XbaI
