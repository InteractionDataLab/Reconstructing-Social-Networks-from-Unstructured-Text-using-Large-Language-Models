Progress
Both projects, regulation bacteria and the blue lagoon, were presented to the tutors followed by a discussion on their viability. Afterwards, it was decided to proceed with the regulation bacteria. The aim for the presentation of the blue lagoon was to answer the questions raised in the presentation yesterday. The aim of the regulation bacteria presentation was to find factor X and fix the system errors.
After some brainstorming, X was set to be an odour. The regulation bacteria can then be compared to commercial products that emit a 'constant' odor. We already found several odour-blocks in the registry, but we're also considering to introduce alternate biobricks for odour, which apparently is not that difficult.

Remarks
It was decided that we will work on the bacterium that regulates a smell intensity based on light intensity.
