[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI on  and the purified pcr product of  in order to get our promotor on itself in the  standard vector.
Gel electroforesis and extraction of this RD. The concentration of this extraction was too low so no ligation was performed with these samples.
Extra pcr was done on  with primers 2260 and 2261.
Liquid cultures of LigX and of  were made from the 4x plates.

Gel electrophoresis from restriction on sam5 and sam8 looked good
Purified and ligated the restriction from sam5 and sam8 overnight
Concentration of sam8 was barely enough for ligation...

[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
a new restrictiondigest  was done for puc and A because we decided that earlier results were not good enough.
There was a gelextraction, nanodrop and ligation done overnight.
The colony PCR of rpoA => 428 again for one minute => bad result
Miniprep of X+K was checked and put on gel. Wrong result probably because we selected a wrong colony.
