Both projects, regulation bacteria and the blue lagoon, were presented to the tutors followed by a discussion on their viability. Afterwards it was decided to proceed with the regulation  bacteria. The aim for the presentation of the blue lagoon was to answer the questions raised  in the presentation yesterday. The aim of the regulaton bacteria presentation was to find  factor X and fix the system error.
For the regulation bacteria, X was set to be an odor after some brainstorming. The regulation bacteria can then be compared to commercial products that emit a 'constant' odor. We found  several odor-blocks in the registry and in the discussion we were notified of the possibility  to introduce alternate biobricks for odor, which apparently was not that difficult.
