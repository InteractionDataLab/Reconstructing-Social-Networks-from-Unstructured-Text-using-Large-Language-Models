Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
miniprep of pBR322 (nanodrop: 24,5ng/µl)
restriction digest of pBR322 with EcoRI and PstI
gelelectrophoresis and extraction of pBR322 (nanodrop: 10,8ng/µl)
ligation of pBR322 with ligA (blp + )
electroporation of cells with LigY (attempt 3)
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Restriction SAMS1 1 X/P,  S/P, EF1 and EF2 E/S, COMT4 2 and COMT1 1 E/X
SAMS and EF show expected results, promotor shows the same result as yesterday (1 part of 900bp and 1 of 2k bp) and COMT looks good.
Ligation of EF + TER, EF was not purified from gel, instead the enzymes were heat inactivated on 65C for 15 min, TER was an older vector which was purified
Promotor  transfered from glycerol (-80) to a plate and liquid culture.
At this point we realised the promotor was not in a standard vector but rather in  which contains an additional RFP after the Spe restriction site, thus a part of 900bp and one of 2k bp is expect when digesting with P
Restriction COMT2, 3 overnight.
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Because virA was now properly inserted in the pucvector we could now start mutagenesis on restriction sites 187 and 720. We did this with PCR. We used a protocol for site-directed-mutagenesis with the matching primers. PCR was done overnight
new ligation for virB was done
