[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
experiment of 24/09 was repeated but the cultures were only grown and lit at 25°C. only the logA were used (in pBR322 vector) because its signal was clearer. In the previous measurement, we noticed that both the cells at 16°C and 25°C showed a higher GFP expression when irradiated with blue light, but we also noticed that because of the cold, the cultures grown at 16°C gave a higher GFP-expression even when they weren't irradiated.  That's why now, we only worked at Room temperature. Both growing overnight in the dark, and during the experiment, the cells were kept at room temperature.  We also noticed that a little cold shock could help our promotor start the GFP-production. The new overented cultures were made using a LB-medium kept at 4°C. This way, we obtained the best results.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Attempts to start another vanilla experiment failed due to lack of materials
gathered materials and next attempt will be saturday
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor

[ edit ] Key/Lock/Anti-Key
Therefore new attempt to ligate the two components in iGEM vectors
