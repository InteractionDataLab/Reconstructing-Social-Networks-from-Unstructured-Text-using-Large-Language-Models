[ edit ] Vanillin Production
We have colonies!!
Lots of EF, enough of SAMS
We made fluid cultures and let them grow overnight
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
PCR mutagenesis from R on 427, PCR purification and gelelectrophoresis: no signal on the picture probably because enting didn't show satisfying results
Ligation van X and Y in K14 at 16°C
New enting of R202
W has been ented on solid agar, so miniprep and nanodrop are scheduled for today
Mutagenesis of W + PCR purification
