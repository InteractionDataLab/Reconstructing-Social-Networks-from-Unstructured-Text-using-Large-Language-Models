Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Plates with LigA were put under blue light. The LEDs were put on their max capacity.
Restriction digest with
tubes (1,3,5,7,9) of LigA (BLP + ) cut with EcoRI en PstI
promotor  cut with EcoRI en SpeI (4x)
Gel electrophoresis with the RD of LigA and  followed by a gel extraction:
Note: tube 5 of LigA was loaded poorly on the gel and could not be used.
Note: the samples of promotor  were barely visible. Only 2 of the 4 samples were recovered by extraction.

[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Electroporation competent cells with EF and SAMS
Cells were plated out and grown overnight
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
TOPO vector with insert W showed some colonies. PCR + electrophoresis were performed for control but a bad and unclear picture was made so the result was not that visible
B and G vector were digested to perform gelextraction
B and G were put on a gel ==> length of the fragments is OK
Enting of R202 in fluid medium en tomorrow second mutation (427)
