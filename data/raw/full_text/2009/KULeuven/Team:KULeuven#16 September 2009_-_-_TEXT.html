Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
miniprep of pRB322 (nanodrop: 59,8ng/µl)
ligY was replated
logA electroporation
plating of pSB3K3 from -80°C freezer.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Restrictions from yesterday were put on gel (COMT2, 3, SAMS, Promotor)
SAMS and promotor( J23110??) were gel purified

Ligation of SAMS + promotor
28 μl of SAMS and 11 μl from promotor, almost 4:1 ratio (although maybe closer to 3:1)
Electroporation of EFT ligation from yesterday on Km plates (Ter vector has Km resistance, so a closing of EF vector on its own doesn't grow!)

The liquid culture of SAMS was used for the glycerol stock and send for sequencing
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Gel-electrophoresis showed bad result for the mutation of virA probably due to too long elongation time. So we performed this PCR again with a new mutation.
Ligation of virB didn't showed the expected result so we did it again.
