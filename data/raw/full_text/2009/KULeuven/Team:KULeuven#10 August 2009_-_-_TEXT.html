Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
PCR reaction with the new primers 2260 and 2261 to get the exact blue light promotor sequence. The reaction was succesful and with no byproducts, so a simple PCR clean up was executed.
concentration of clean pcr product.:
102,6 ng/µl
1,88
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Ligated genes are electrophoresed.
Reorderd part  (COMT + RBS) from the registry.
Also we realized the proteins need to be degraded fast for the control mechanism to work, so a ssRA degradation tag like ANDENYALVA or ANDENYALAA is needed.
However since some genes have just been ligated we will only tag sam5, COMT and the ech gene.
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
There was no result from our setup on Friday. We think there was an error with the protocol because we didn't shake before incubation. So we did a new transformation of every gene.
