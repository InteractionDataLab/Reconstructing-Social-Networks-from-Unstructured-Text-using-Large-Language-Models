COMT was grown
sam5 and sam8 were ligated
ech and fcs were ligated
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Primers for mutagenesis have arrived
We used the DNA parts from the second PCR to insert them into a TOPO-vector. The second PCR showed more results so that is why we used these fragments.
LBmedium was made with X-gal to select cells afterwards.
Plasmids were inserted in competent cells by heatshock and those cells were plated out on the X-gal medium.
