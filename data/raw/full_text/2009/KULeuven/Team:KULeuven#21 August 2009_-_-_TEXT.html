[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Test 2: We loaded yesterday's restrictions on an agarose gel. It showed that the enzymes cut properly.
However, the EF results were unexpected. It seems that somehow the bacteria had taken in a self-closed ech-plasmid. The signals do not correspond with an EF-ligation product.
The DNA was purified from the gel
