Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
a new restriction digest on logA (1&2) was done.
the re-enting of likA was succesfull and the liquid culture was miniprepped. likA: 179,3 ng/µl. a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI was performed and put on gel. the signals were good.
a glycerol stock of ligY was made and some samples for sequencing were prepared.
a motherplate of LogA en LikA were made and liquid cultures to make a glycerol stock.
liquid cultures were also made for empty top10 cells, standard promotor  and LikA (blp and GFP in pSB3K3).

Again PstI din't cut overnight in both samples. A new restriction digest was done over one day because pstI did need maye more time to cut.
Electroporation of virB showed good results so motherplates were made
