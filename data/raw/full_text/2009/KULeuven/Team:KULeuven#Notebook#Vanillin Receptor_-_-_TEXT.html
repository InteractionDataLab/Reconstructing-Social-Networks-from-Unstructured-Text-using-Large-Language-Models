Check biobricks for vanillin detection
[ edit ] Wednesday
Mail University of Valencia because of inconsistent sequence in the parts registry [Done]
Week 3: 20 July 2009 - 26 July 2009
[ edit ] Wednesday
Received mail from Valencia: The vanillin Receptor is not usable, Madrid also tried to use and ran into all sorts of problems: Problems span from the binding of the periplasmic protein to the vanillin molecule, to the function of the fusion protein, to the activation of the ompR.
There are two solutions to this problem:
Construct a different vanillin receptor
Using virA/virG, a phenol receptor in agrobacterium .
Detect an alternative substance that has a linear relationship with the vanillin concentration
Vanillin inhibits the Ahl receptor
Synthesis of another signaling molecule that will be sensed
[ edit ] Friday
Possible receptor is the virA/virG system from Agrobacterium, the virA protein will bind to phenolic compounds and induce transcription of vir genes by phosphorylation of virG. Protein ChvE results in a broader response to phenolic compounds. Papers:

Week 4: 27 July 2009 - 2 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
Template:Team:KULeuven/27 July 2009/VanillinReceptor
[ edit ] Tuesday
The primers for the following components of the receptor were ordered:
VirA
VirG
RpoA
VirB promoter region
[ edit ] Wednesday

[ edit ] Thursday
Template:Team:KULeuven/30 July 2009/VanillinReceptor
[ edit ] Friday
The primers for site directed mutagenesis were made:
Two primer-sets for mutating the PstI site out of VirA
Two primer-sets for mutating the EcoRI site out of RpoA
Week 5: 3 August 2009 - 9 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain pTiA6NC/A1011 was plated out on LB-medium.
Primers for virA, virG, promotor region virB and RpoA have arrived
[ edit ] Tuesday
The primers made for the directed mutagenesis on Friday were ordered
PCR was done with primers for virA, virG, promotorregion virB and RpoA with template DNA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens pTiA6NC/A1011 to isolate the genes
[ edit ] Wednesday
Gel electrophoresis was done to see if PCR has worked. VirA, virB and rpoA showed a clear result. We performed miniprep on those genes to purify and clear them. VirG didn't show any result.
We did a new PCR for all the genes and especially for virG with a better annealing temperature. The gel electrophoresis showed a good and clear result for all the genes.
[ edit ] Thursday
VirA, virB, virG and rpoA were purified and nanodropped
All the genes were elongated with polyA-tails to make it possible to insert them into a TOPO-vector
[ edit ] Friday
Primers for mutagenesis have arrived
We used the DNA parts from the second PCR to insert them into a TOPO-vector. The second PCR showed more results so that is why we used these fragments.
LBmedium was made with X-gal to select cells afterwards.
Plasmids were inserted in competent cells by heatshock and those cells were plated out on the X-gal medium.
Week 6: 10 August 2009 - 16 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
There was no result from our setup on Friday. We think there was an error with the protocol because we didn't shake before incubation. So we did a new transformation of every gene.
[ edit ] Tuesday
We also received another strain of Agrobacterium. We brought this new strain in culture.
To make things clear the genes from the first Agrobacterium will from now on be called A,B,G and R for respectively virA, promotor region virB , virG and rpoA. For the second Agrobacterium we will use W,X,Y and Z to indicate the same genes.
We achieved good results for genes B,G and R. There were clear white colonies after plating the competent cells with the TOPO vector on X-gal agar plates with ampicillin. We isolated the good colonies again.
There was no result for A. This was probably due to a fault with the competent cells. So we started TOPO transformation by heatshock all over for A.
[ edit ] Wednesday
B,G and R were stored for further procedure. A failed again: there was no visible growth. This second time there was no problem with the competent cells because we used a commercial product instead of a self made. We assumed there was a problem with adding the polyA-tails to the PCR product because, when redoing the gelelectrophoresis, there were no errors with the PCR product.
We did a new PCR on the bacteria with the inserted plasmids for B,G and R to check if the gene was inserted correctly.
PCR was performed for W,X,Y and Z to isolate the genes.
[ edit ] Thursday
B and R miniprepped. Tomorrow proceed with mutagenesis of RpoA

800bp fragment + 200bp TOPO)
Inoculate 2 and 3 and grow on ....
TOPO from W and Z and again from A
Note: if A fails again (with the iGEM protocol) then proceed with a new PCR purification.
Mutagenesis 1 on position 202 of R was performed
Week 7: 17 August 2009 - 23 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
A failed again so we decided to work only with W instead of performing a new PCR. TOPO for W and Z worked because there were colonies visible. White colonies were plated out.
Fluid cultures of G2 and G3 were miniprepped, nanodropped and cut with Dpn I to exclude the motherstrain
Mutagenesis 2 on R on position 427 was performed with PCR
[ edit ] Tuesday
PCR purification miniprep and nanodrop of R on mutation 2
Start ethanol precipitation (overnight ethanol + sodium acetate) to create a better result (more purified product) of product R with mutation 202
PCR of the fragments of TOPO (W and Z) was done to check if TOPO worked. Gelelectrophoresis showed nothing so TOPO cloning failed again for virA.
[ edit ] Wednesday
Continued with ethanol precipitation for R. Electroporation and outplating were performed
[ edit ] Thursday
Restriction digest of X, Y and  with EcoR1 and Pst1
Gelelectrophoresis to check fragments and gelextraction
Fluid medium from outplated cells (overgrowth)
TOPO-cloning (with new protocol from Invitrogen) for W and Z
[ edit ] Friday
TOPO cloning of W looks goods with clear white colonies. 5 colonies were selected and cultured for testing
Week 8: 24 August 2009 - 30 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
TOPO vector with insert W showed some colonies. PCR + electrophoresis were performed for control but a bad and unclear picture was made so the result was not that visible
B and G vector were digested to perform gelextraction
B and G were put on a gel ==> length of the fragments is OK
Enting of R202 in fluid medium en tomorrow second mutation (427)
[ edit ] Tuesday
PCR mutagenesis from R on 427, PCR purification and gelelectrophoresis: no signal on the picture probably because enting didn't show satisfying results
Ligation van X and Y in K14 at 16°C
New enting of R202
W has been ented on solid agar, so miniprep and nanodrop are scheduled for today
Mutagenesis of W + PCR purification
[ edit ] Wednesday
PCR for the second mutation of R was done
Electroporation of B and G after the ligation yesterday
PCR was done for controle of W to check if virA was inserted into the cell. The picture made after gelelectrophorsis showed a wrong result
[ edit ] Thursday
Because of bad results yesterday the transformation of W was extra checked by performing a new PCR with different primers :
sample A : M13forward - virAforward sample B : M13forward - virAreverse sample C : virAforward - virAreverse sample D : M13reverse - virAforward sample E : M13reverse - virAreverse
Afterwards was gelelectrophoresis done and this showed virA was not present in the cell.
ligation of X and Y showed a pover result so new ligations were done for virB and virG
[ edit ] Friday
new  TOPO-cloning was done but with a change in protocol. Ligationtime of the fragement in the vector was changed from 5 minutes to overnight.
mutagenesis of rpoA on 202 was done but this showed no result on gel.
A new PCR was done to have more virA
Week 9: 31 August 2009 - 6 September 2009
[ edit ] Monday
TOPO cloning showed only blue colonies so we searched for alternatives. We did resaerchwork if it was maybe possible with a puc-vector
The mutation of rpoA was again checked but gelelectrophoresis showed no result
X,Y and K (the igemvector) were cut with EcoR1 and Pst1.
new ligation was done with the first cuttingproduct so today it was electroporated and plated.
PCR was done for W to get more basicproduct to work with
[ edit ] Tuesday
There was a gel made to check if basicproduct W was correctly PCRed, and if the restriction digest of X,Y and K was good.
rpoA mutation on 202 was put on gel but there was no result
a plate was made of kolonies of Y+K ligation with aim to make a motherplate
[ edit ] Wednesday
there was made a controllgel of virA for our basicproduct, purification and nanodrop
the two ligations X+K were checked and electroporated
X was digested again and ligated in K
There were fluid cultures made for ligation of Y+K
A new PCR was done for rpoA mutagenesis : elongationstep was now taken 4 minutes instead of 1 minute
[ edit ] Thursday
The Y+K ligation was miniprepped and nanodropped to make later on a stock on glycerol
We decided to use for virA a puc19-vector in stead of TOPO, puc was digested with Xba1 and Ecor1 and virA was digested with EcoR1 and Spe1. This was done overnight.
electroporation + plating was done for X+K
[ edit ] Friday
gelextraction and nanodrop for puc and A. The digest was done well.
mutagenesis was tried with colony pCR on position 428
Week 10: 7 September 2009 - 13 September 2009
[ edit ] Monday
a new restrictiondigest  was done for puc and A because we decided that earlier results were not good enough.
There was a gelextraction, nanodrop and ligation done overnight.
The colony PCR of rpoA => 428 again for one minute => bad result
Miniprep of X+K was checked and put on gel. Wrong result probably because we selected a wrong colony.
[ edit ] Tuesday
restriction digest of A and puc were done
overnight ligation of puc and A
[ edit ] Wednesday
fluid cultures were made of rpoA, X+K and the motherplate of virG so we could miniprep this tomorrow
ligation of puc and A was electroporated
new ligation of X+K was tried out
[ edit ] Thursday
puc+A was plated
X+K was again elctroporated
[ edit ] Friday
Glycerolstock was made for virG and a sample was send for seqencing
virA was ented
new TOPOcloning was done for rpoA with a new protocol we recieved
Week 11: 14 September 2009 - 20 September 2009
[ edit ] Monday
miniprep of virA in the uc vector, fragment was digested a the gelelectrophoresis showed a good result
new restriction digest for virB was done
TOPO-cloning for rpoA failed again, so due to deadlines we decided that there was to few time left to do the TOPO-cloning again or with new protocols and to do the mutagenesis also.
[ edit ] Tuesday
Because virA was now properly inserted in the pucvector we could now start mutagenesis on restriction sites 187 and 720. We did this with PCR. We used a protocol for site-directed-mutagenesis with the matching primers. PCR was done overnight
new ligation for virB was done
[ edit ] Wednesday
Gel-electrophoresis showed bad result for the mutation of virA probably due to too long elongation time. So we performed this PCR again with a new mutation.
Ligation of virB didn't showed the expected result so we did it again.
[ edit ] Thursday
New PCR showed a better result for virA and geleclectrophoresis showed some result. The motherstrain was cut with DpnI to remove those residues, PCR-purification was performed and a restriction digest with PstI was done to see if restriction sites indeed were mutated
virB ligation in K was again
[ edit ] Friday
We checked if the PstI had cut the mutagenated places by gel-electrophoresis but we forgot to add a sample as positive control so the restriction digest was done again. The result we put on gel and saw that there was no cutting in both samples. Restriction disgest with pstI was now done overnight.
virB ligation showed good results so it was electroporated
