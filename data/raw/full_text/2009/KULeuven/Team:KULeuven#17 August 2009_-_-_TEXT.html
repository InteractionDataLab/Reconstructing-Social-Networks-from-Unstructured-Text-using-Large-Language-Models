[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Liquid cultures have been made for the kanamycine resistant plasmid backbone  and for the LigA (BLP+ in ).
Lig B has been re-ented on a new plate because too many cells had grown on the one we made on aug 14. We always used single kolonies to re-ent.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
SAMS (ligation sam5+sam8) and EF (ligation ech+fcs): electroporated ...
and plated out
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
A failed again so we decided to work only with W instead of performing a new PCR. TOPO for W and Z worked because there were colonies visible. White colonies were plated out.
Fluid cultures of G2 and G3 were miniprepped, nanodropped and cut with Dpn I to exclude the motherstrain
Mutagenesis 2 on R on position 427 was performed with PCR
