Week 1: 6 July 2009 - 12 July 2009
Week 2: 13 July 2009 - 19 July 2009
[ edit ] Thursday
Plating the glycerol stock strain containing .
Week 3: 20 July 2009 - 26 July 2009
[ edit ] Wednesday
Liquid culture of  has been made.
[ edit ] Thursday
The plasmid of  has been isolated from the liquid culture. The glycerol stock strain containing  has been plated.
[ edit ] Friday
The glycerol stock strain containing  has been plated. The key+terminator sequence, the lock sequence and the antikey+terminator sequence have all been ordered at GeneArt.
Week 4: 27 July 2009 - 2 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
Following parts were put in liquid medium:
+ : GFP with LVA tag and terminators
TetR-promoter
[ edit ] Tuesday
Following plasmids were purified:
GFP with LVA tag
concentration: 94,1 ng/μl
260/280: 1,94
tetR-promoter
concentration: 98,2 ng/μl
260/280: 1,89
Week 5: 3 August 2009 - 9 August 2009

Week 12: 21 September 2009 - 27 September 2009
Week 13: 28 September 2009 - 4 October 2009
[ edit ] Tuesday
We finally received the lock and the antisense key from geneart.
Electroporation and plating out the two components.
[ edit ] Wednesday
Liquid culture of the two components has been made

Restriction digest overnight: enzymes EcoRI and PstI
[ edit ] Friday
Gel electrophoresis and purification
Ligation of lock and antisense key in pSB1A2 (over weekend)
Week 14: 5 October 2009 - 11 October 2009
[ edit ] Monday
Electroporation of the ligation
Plating out the electroporated cells
[ edit ] Tuesday
No growth visible
[ edit ] Wednesday
Therefore new attempt to ligate the two components in iGEM vectors
Restriction digest: EcoRI and PstI
[ edit ] Thursday
Gel electrophoresis and purification
Ligation (overnight): both lock and antisense key are ligated in pSB1A2 and pSB3K3
[ edit ] Friday
Electroporated and plated out the ligations
[ edit ] Sunday
Liquid culture (the lock and antisense key in iGEM vectors)
Week 15: 12 October 2009 - 18 October 2009
[ edit ] Monday
Miniprep and nanodrop
Lock (pSB1A2): ng/µl
Antisense key (pSB3K3): ng/µl
