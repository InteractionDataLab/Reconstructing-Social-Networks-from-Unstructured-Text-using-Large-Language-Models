Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
The PCR reaction that was done Wednesday was put on an agarose gel and run for an hour. Afterwards, the lane was purified by gel extraction and miniprepped. Three different samples with the same product were measured through the nanodrop:
Concentration:
192,7 ng/µl
161,9 ng/µl
155,1 ng/µl
260/280
1,82
1,82
1,80
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Following parts were put into competent cells by electroporation:
RBS + ech, in ,
RBS + fcs, in ,
The cells were then transferred to liquid LBmedium to recuperate from the procedure. After a few hours they were transferred to LB/amp plates and grown overnight at 37°C.
