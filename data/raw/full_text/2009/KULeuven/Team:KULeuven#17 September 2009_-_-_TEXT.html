Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
electroporation of logA (ligA in pBR322, a low copy plasmid).
a PCR on pSB3K3 with primers ......
restriction digest of pSB3K3, pBR322 and ligA with EcoRI and PstI followed by a gel electrophoresis and extraction.
ligations of ligA (blp+GFP) with pBR322 (logA) and pSB3K3 (likA) were put overnight
was taken from the distribution plates and plated on LB
liquid cultures of ligY (blp) were made in the morning, grew and were miniprepped in the evening followed by a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
EFT Ligation transfered colonies to a new plate and to liquid culture
Electroporation of PAMS (Promotor, Sam5, Sam8)
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
New PCR showed a better result for virA and geleclectrophoresis showed some result. The motherstrain was cut with DpnI to remove those residues, PCR-purification was performed and a restriction digest with PstI was done to see if restriction sites indeed were mutated
virB ligation in K was again
