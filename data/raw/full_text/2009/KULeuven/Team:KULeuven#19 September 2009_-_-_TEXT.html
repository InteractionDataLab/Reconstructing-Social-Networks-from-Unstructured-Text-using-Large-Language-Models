enting of the electroporated logA from 18/09. the enting was done on tc(5) as wel as on ap plates. there should not be any growth on the ap plates since the resistence gene is cut in half by the insert. the electroporation of likA didn't show any growth
a new RD of ligA, pSB3K3 and pBR322 with EcoRI and PstI were done and put overnight.
an electroporation of likA and logA (ligations from 18/09) was done
