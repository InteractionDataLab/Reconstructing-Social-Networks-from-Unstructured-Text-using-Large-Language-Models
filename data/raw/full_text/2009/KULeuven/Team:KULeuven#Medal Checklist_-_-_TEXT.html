We've improved the RiboLock (K238024) and sam5 (K238007).
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We've helped the Valencia and TU Delft teams with their ethics survey, and sent in some parts that were designed by the Berkeley 2006 team and the Edinburgh 2007 team.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We've made a questionnaire and written a literature study about the ethics of synthetic biology.
Silver medal requirements
Complete the Bronze Medal requirements
Done
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We've demonstrated that our blue light promotor (K238013) works!
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on the Parts or Device page via the Registry of Parts
We've compared the blue light promoter to the reference promoter and tested the effect of blue light on its activity.
Bronze medal requirements
Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
