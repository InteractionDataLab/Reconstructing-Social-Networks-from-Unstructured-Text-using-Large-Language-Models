Overview
Blue light receptor
Vanillin receptor
Vanillin production
Key/Lock/antikey
The labwork is divided into four groups, each working on a specific aspect of Essencia coli
Blue Light Receptor
Purifying the promotor region and creating it into a new biobrick
Vanillin Production
Testing the three enzyme (from Tyrosine to Ferrulic acid) and two enzyme pathway (from Ferulic acid to Vanillin) and eventually combining the five enzymes.
Vanillin Receptor
Removing unwanted restriction sites, sequencing and combining all elements into a standard iGEM plasmid.
Key/Lock/Antikey
Ligating Key, Lock and Antikey into promotor plasmids and testing the system with a GFP assay.
