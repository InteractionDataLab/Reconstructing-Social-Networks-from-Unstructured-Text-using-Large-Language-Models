Introduction
The team members are undergraduates, advised by Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty members.
The competition raised a great deal of interest and a balanced number of engineers and life-scientists were selected. Each team member spends his/her summer holiday working on the project.
The project was housed at the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering which provided a space for experiments, access to computers and appropriate equipment.
