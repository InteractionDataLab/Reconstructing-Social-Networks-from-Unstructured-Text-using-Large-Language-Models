Weekly meeting
Presentation from the weekly meeting
Focus on the last two parts in the synthesis of vanillin since that pathway has been proven
Can always add additional 3 paths
To do
Send mail to U. Edinburgh for the proteins for vanillin synthesis [Done]
Received mail back from Edinburgh, biobricks of the parts should be done. Will receive answer next week
Grow the available parts [Done]
Wet-lab
,  and
Cells with the parts grown on medium with Ap
