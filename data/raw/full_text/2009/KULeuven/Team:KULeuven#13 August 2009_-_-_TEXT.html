Restriction digest on ech and sam8
Gel electrophoresis on ech and sam8
New electrocompetent cells were used for the electroporation with the old ligations
Lig A -> sam5 + sam8
Lig C -> ech + fcs
Note: there was no spark
Plating of the electroporated cells
200 μl per plate twice
600 μl left of A and C

B and R miniprepped. Tomorrow proceed with mutagenesis of RpoA
G redone (only TOPO was visible, 200bp)  PCR from 2,3 and 1'
W, X, Y, Z PCR purification to create a TOPO vector tomorrow
