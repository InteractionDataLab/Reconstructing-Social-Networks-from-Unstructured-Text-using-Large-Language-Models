1 VANILLIN SYNTHESIS
1.1 Goal
1.2 Required
1.3 Where from
1.4 Steps
VANILLIN SYNTHESIS
Goal
Making vanillin from tyrosine in a five-step pathway.
Making vanillin from tyrosine
Required
Biobricks:
SAM8: : coding sequence without RBS
SAM5: : RBS site + PstI restriction site removed
COMT: : coding sequence without RBS
FCS:  : RBS + fcs in pSB1A2
ECH:  : RBS + ech in pSB1A2
Where from
SAM8, SAM5, COMT, FCS, ECH will be sent to us from the French Lab from the university Edinburgh
Steps
We will be working in three different stages
Testing the transformation of tyrosin to ferrulic acid. The enzymes are put under a constitutive promoter and transcribed. Ferrulic acid concentrations are then measured with GC
Testing the transformation of ferrulic acid to vanillin. The enzymes are put under a constitutive promoter and transcribed. Ferrulic acid concentrations are then measured with GC
If both are tested and ok, they can be combined into one plasmid and again tested.
Then, the locks need to be added.
Testing the enzymes by detecting the endproducts through gaschromatography.
One problem might be that the tyrosine of E. coli is depleted too fast
