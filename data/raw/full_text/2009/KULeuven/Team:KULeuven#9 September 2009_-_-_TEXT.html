[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
FACS-ing the liquid cultures that were put under blue light on 08/09 gave no significant results.
Motherplate for  was made
liquid cultures for checking the ligX were made.
LC with  were miniprepped, nanodropped, restriction digested and put on gel. The signals were good. The vector, pSB1A2, was cut from the gel and gel extracted (10ng/µl). This was ligated with  (LigY).

[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Restriction digest on Terminator
Growth on SAMS plates (woohoo!)
Transferred 4 colonies from the SAMS plates (SAMS1, SAMS1 pellet, SAMS2, SAMS2 pellet) to a new plate
Gel electrophoresis of all the 8 EF restriction digests (2 per colony)
Cut and purified EF1 and EF3

[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
fluid cultures were made of rpoA, X+K and the motherplate of virG so we could miniprep this tomorrow
ligation of puc and A was electroporated
new ligation of X+K was tried out
