[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
The electroporated ligY did not grow. A new restriction digest on pcr product  was performed with EcoRI and PstI.This was put on gel. There was a good signal so it was used to perform a ligation with vector pSB1A2.
A liquid culture that was made from pSB3K3 a few days ago showed growth after all. This was miniprepped and restriction digested to check whether the vector is actually present.
The liquid cultures with our blue light construct (lig) that stood overnight at 16°C was FACS-ed. Half of the cultures were exposed to blue light during the day and put under the FACS in the evening.

Promotor restriction results in 2 parts of 800 bp and 2k bp
EFT electroporation no result, try again on monday...
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
Glycerolstock was made for virG and a sample was send for seqencing
virA was ented
new TOPOcloning was done for rpoA with a new protocol we recieved
