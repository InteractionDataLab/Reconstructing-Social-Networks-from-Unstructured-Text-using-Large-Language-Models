Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
There was good growth of the cells that were electroporated with ligX. 4 single colonies were selected and plated on Ap medium. This was all done in a dark room to avoid activation of the promotor.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Restriction digest overnight of sam5 (1,2) and sam8 (1,2)
Growth of EF Ligation (woohoo!)
Transferred 4 colonies from EF ligation to a new plate
Put the 4 transferred colonies on liquid medium
A miniprep and restriction digest (ON) of sam5, sam8, ech and fcs was performed on Saturday. On Sunday, a gel was run to check the inserts. These were good so a motherplate for all the genes could be made.
