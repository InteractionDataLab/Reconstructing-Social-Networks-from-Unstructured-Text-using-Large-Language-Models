[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
measurement of the liquid culuters of 24/09:
at first glance it seemed that there was indeed repression of the promoter on 25°. further conclusions from the results could however not be made yet.
a new experiment will be done on tuesday the 29th with cultures that only grew on 25°C.
