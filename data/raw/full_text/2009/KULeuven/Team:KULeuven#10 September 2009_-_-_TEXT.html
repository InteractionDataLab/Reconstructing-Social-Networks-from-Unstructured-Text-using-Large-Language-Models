Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Since the results from our light experiments keep failing, some new ideas were computed. pSB1A2 is the backbone for our construct but since this is a high copy number plasmid perhaps the ratio of promotor to repressor is unequal (not enough repressor). A new enting in LC was done with ligX. These were grown for a few hours at 37°C and then put in 16°C room overnight so that more repressor can be made (its promotor is temperature-sensitive).
Ligation from 09/08 was electroporated in competent cells.
Miniprep of LigX, restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. The signals were good so a motherplate for ligX was made. Also, the vector pSB1A2 was extracted from the gel (39,1 ng/µl).
