E. coli Transcription rates
Using the test data on constitutive promotors on the parts registry, we estimated the transcription rate of these promotors. The transcription rate of  was estimated from the data in reference [1]. The transcription rates of the other constitutive promotors were scaled according to the table in the parts registry.

E. coli Translation rates
Last year they estimated the translation rate for . Some other translation rates were scaled according to the table in the parts registry assuming the relation is linear.
