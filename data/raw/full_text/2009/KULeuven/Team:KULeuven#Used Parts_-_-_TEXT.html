Vanillin synthesis
Biobrick in registry
5 paths in pathway never tested together in E. coli
Short Vanillin synthesis
Biobrick in registry
Short version containing the last 2 genes of the pathway, these have been tested in E. coli
Short Vanillin synthesis II
Biobrick in registry
Short version containing the first 3 parts of the pathway, these have not been tested in E. coli
