Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
1) Miniprep of parts - and LigA BLP-
2) Restriction digest of the DNA from step 1 with EcoRI and PstI
3) Gel electrophoresis to check if the insert in the plasmid is the correct size, which it was, so the ligation was succesful.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Cells didn't grow. Yet again...
Re-plated the ligation products (SAMS and EF)
We propose 3 tests to check if the restriction digest (esp. between EcoRI and XbaI, because they lie very close together) works properly:
Test 1: Cut every plasmid (sam8, sam5, ech, Fcs) separately with EcoRI, XbaI and -only sam8 and fcs- with SpeI.
Test 2: Cut subsequently with EcoRI and XbaI, leaving an incubation period of 1h between two digests. Total volume: 30µl, to dilute glycerol (which inhibits restriction)
Test 3: Use pUC18 vector
Made fluid cultures of sam8, sam5, ech, fcs
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
PCR purification miniprep and nanodrop of R on mutation 2
Start ethanol precipitation (overnight ethanol + sodium acetate) to create a better result (more purified product) of product R with mutation 202
PCR of the fragments of TOPO (W and Z) was done to check if TOPO worked. Gelelectrophoresis showed nothing so TOPO cloning failed again for virA.
