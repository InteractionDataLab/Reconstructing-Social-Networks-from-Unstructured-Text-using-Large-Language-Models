[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Gel extraction performed on the signals from 3/09
Nanodrop: 14,7 ng/µl of  with a 260/280 of approx 2,12
Ligation with  and  (ligX 1)
A new restriction digest on  and  with EcoRI and SpeI was performed.
Gel extraction of these new digests.  was nanodropped with a concentration of 28 ng/µl. this was ligated with  (ligX 2)
Electroporation of
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
The restriction digest from SAMS and the terminator was put on gel
It appears there is no SAMS in between the vector, the length is approx. 1500 bp which can only be sam5 or sam8
Electroporation of the ligation EF
Plated and put at 37°C
Liquid cultures made from sam5, sam8, ech and fcs.
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
gelextraction and nanodrop for puc and A. The digest was done well.
mutagenesis was tried with colony pCR on position 428
