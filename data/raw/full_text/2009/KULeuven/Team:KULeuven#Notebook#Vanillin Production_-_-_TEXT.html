Focus on the last two parts in the synthesis of vanillin since that pathway has been proven
Can always add additional 3 paths
Send mail to U. Edinburgh for the proteins for vanillin synthesis [Done]
Received mail back from Edinburgh, biobricking of the parts should still be done. Will receive answer next week
Week 3: 20 July 2009 - 26 July 2009
[ edit ] Friday
Received mail from U. Edinburgh: We will receive:
sam5; no part number, Pst1 site removed
sam8; coding sequence without RBS
COMT; coding sequence without RBS
ech; RBS + ech, in ,
fcs; RBS + fcs, in ,

[ edit ] Wednesday
We received mail from Edinburgh today. The following plasmids have arrived:
RBS + ech, in ,
RBS + fcs, in ,
They were put in the freezer and will be incorporated into competent cells, so they can be multiplied and stored.
[ edit ] Thursday
Following parts were put into competent cells by electroporation:
RBS + ech, in ,
RBS + fcs, in ,
The cells were then transferred to liquid LBmedium to recuperate from the procedure. After a few hours they were transferred to LB/amp plates and grown overnight at 37°C.

Week 5: 3 August 2009 - 9 August 2009
[ edit ] Monday
We received the COMT, sam5 and sam8 from Edinburgh today. Unfortunately, the tube containing the sam5 + RBS (with the PstI site) was opened during transport and all DNA in it was lost. The others were transferred into competent cells by electroporation.
sam5 + RBS in  (with PstI site removed),
sam8 + RBS in ,
sam8 in  coding sequence,
COMT in  coding sequence,
The cells were put into liquid LB to recuperate from the procedure, transferred onto LB/amp plates and grown overnight at 37°C.
We also made liquid cultures of the RBS + fcs and RBS + ech cultures so we can miniprep them tomorrow.
[ edit ] Tuesday
Liquid cultures were made out of the sam5, sam8 and COMT colonies grown overnight. They will be mini-prepped tomorrow to get the plasmid DNA out.
Plasmid DNA from the ech and fcs liquid cultures was isolated today. It yielded respectively 108,8 and 113,9 ng/µl.

Miniprep of pairs:
RBS + sam5 conc: 101,3 ng/ul
RBS + sam8 conc: 95.7 ng/ul

C2: ech, EcoRI en XbaI
The mixture was incubated in 37°C for 1h30...
...followed by gel electrophoresis of the digested parts
[ edit ] Thursday
Today the purification of the gel electrophoresis was done on the cells from yesterday.  Nanodrop concentrations:
A1, sam5: 11,6 ng/ul
A2, sam8: 5,5 ng/ul
B2, COMT:  24,3 ng/ul
C1, fcs:  16,6 ng/ul
C2, ech:  16,9 ng/ul
A1 and A2 showed a very low concentration and the 260/280 value was quite high so both were electrophoresed again. B1 (RBS) had failed because it was too short, however ligating B1 and B2 (COMT) was no longer needed since the part with RBS was available in the iGEM 2009 kit .
A1 and A2 were redigested:
A1: sam8, EcoRI en SpeI
A2: sam5, EcoRI en XbaI
followed by gel electrophoresis

[ edit ] Monday
Ligated genes are electrophoresed.
Reorderd part  (COMT + RBS) from the registry.
Also we realized the proteins need to be degraded fast for the control mechanism to work, so a ssRA degradation tag like ANDENYALVA or ANDENYALAA is needed.
However since some genes have just been ligated we will only tag sam5, COMT and the ech gene.
[ edit ] Tuesday
There was no growth of sam8/sam5, fcs/ech and COMT plates.
Possible reason is a problem with the electrocompetent cells
Or the concentration of sam5/sam8 is too low
Plan for tomorrow is to create new electrocompetent cells
Prepared LB and glycerol today
Made liquid cultures sam8, sam5, fcs and ech
Made new agarplates with Ampicilin

Gel extraction of the 4 lanes from sam8 () and ech ()
To test an additional blanc, we extracted a blanc piece of gel
Nanodrop results were done with the conventional blanc (just elution buffer) and with the extracted blanco gel. However, since the results between both varied too much and the extracted blanco gel was not significantly better, we decided to use the conventional blanco in order to compare between former nanodrop measurements

SAMS (ligation sam5+sam8) and EF (ligation ech+fcs): electroporated ...
and plated out
[ edit ] Tuesday
Cells didn't grow. Yet again...
Re-plated the ligation products (SAMS and EF)
We propose 3 tests to check if the restriction digest (esp. between EcoRI and XbaI, because they lie very close together) works properly:
Test 1: Cut every plasmid (sam8, sam5, ech, Fcs) separately with EcoRI, XbaI and -only sam8 and fcs- with SpeI.
Test 2: Cut subsequently with EcoRI and XbaI, leaving an incubation period of 1h between two digests. Total volume: 30µl, to dilute glycerol (which inhibits restriction)
Test 3: Use pUC18 vector
Made fluid cultures of sam8, sam5, ech, fcs

Test 1: Results from yesterday's restriction test were inconclusive, because the DNA ladder didn't run properly so the length of the fragments couldn't be read. Therefore, we did it again...
Restriction=OK! Test 1 completed.
3)
Test 2: cutting with 2 enzymes subsequently (1h incubation in between) in a volume of 30µl. Using a larger volume should dilute the glycerol, which inhibits cutting. After that, the products are incubated overnight to allow full restriction. sam8 and fcs are cut with EcoRI and SpeI; sam5 and ech are cut with EcoRI and XbaI

Test 2: We loaded yesterday's restrictions on an agarose gel. It showed that the enzymes cut properly.
However, the EF results were unexpected. It seems that somehow the bacteria had taken in a self-closed ech-plasmid. The signals do not correspond with an EF-ligation product.
The DNA was purified from the gel

Electroporation of SAMS I, SAMS II AND EF II
Restriction digest of ech and fcs from Saturday was tested and showed 6 signals with varying lengths for ech and 1 very large signal for fcs, both inconsistent. To test for errors in the restriction sites we cut each vector with 1 restriction digest for each of the sites. Giving a total of 4 tests for ech and 4 for fcs.
Restriction at 37°C overnight.
For ligation of SAMS III RD (from Thursday) and TER II we need 44,4 µl of SAMS III which we don't have thus we cut two additional volumes with SAMS I overnight
SAMS I A RD and SAMS I B RD
[ edit ] Tuesday
SAMS I B RD is used for ligation with TER II RD
Since we want to avoid gel purification, we use the direct sample from the restriction digest

No signal... grrr...
Replated colonies from the original SAMS plate from 24/8
Took 4 individual colonies and plated them on 4 corners of a petri dish
the 4 genes(sam5, sam8, ech, fcs) where taken from the original DNA that was sent, electroporated and plated. This in order to make a glycerol stock.
We also started another method to try and ligate the different genes for vanillin production by using PCR. Today we did PCR on the ech, fcs, sam5 and sam8 genes to get the DNA out of the plasmid. We used the prefix and suffix primers from last year, these primers keep the pre- and suffix of the biobrick part intact and allow us to work with the purified biobricks themself.
[ edit ] Wednesday
The four grown colonies are put on liquid culture
New (again...) restriction digest on sam5, sam8, fcs and ech, genes were miniprepped on Tuesday.
Overnight at 16°C
The plates with sam5, sam8, ech and fcs were re-ented. From sam5 and fcs four colonies were picked and plated.
The PCR from yesterday did not deliver any results, probably because of an error when preparing the PCR mix. A new PCR was prepared and started today.

PCR
The PCR from yesterday went very well, we had a huge amount of amplified biobrick DNA of the different parts. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to test if the different pieces of DNA created by PCR had the correct length.

The restriction digest from SAMS and the terminator was put on gel
It appears there is no SAMS in between the vector, the length is approx. 1500 bp which can only be sam5 or sam8

Restriction digest on EF1, EF2, EF3 and EF4
Gel electrophoresis of digestion, result: EF1 and EF3 appear to have an insert. The insert of EF4 is too short, between 1500 and 2000 bp (might just be ech) and EF2 appears to have been cut by only 1 enzyme
Also, restriction digest overnight results in an extra very weak intensity band at 600 and one between 1500 and 2000 bp
This result has been seen before on just ech. It might be due to an extra restriction site on the ech gene. The two bands could result from this same band. The addition of both bands would then be the same as the insert.

Restriction  with S/P, SAMS2 P (was already cut with E/X) and EF3 with E/S
Another attempt at electroporating EFT using EFT ligation from last week
Gel electroforesis of 5 μl from the restriction sample (30 μl)
Nothing in EF lane (no DNA???)
Promotor showed again two results of 900bp and 2k bp (wut is going on?)
An attempt was made to seperate the restriction enzymes by PCR purification on the remaining restriction sample, however nanodrop showed very confusing results, conclusion: let's not try this again. Next time heat inactivation of restriction enzymes to make sure they are inactive.
Made mother plate of SAMS
[ edit ] Tuesday
Restriction SAMS1 1 X/P,  S/P, EF1 and EF2 E/S, COMT4 2 and COMT1 1 E/X
SAMS and EF show expected results, promotor shows the same result as yesterday (1 part of 900bp and 1 of 2k bp) and COMT looks good.
Ligation of EF + TER, EF was not purified from gel, instead the enzymes were heat inactivated on 65C for 15 min, TER was an older vector which was purified
Promotor  transfered from glycerol (-80) to a plate and liquid culture.
At this point we realised the promotor was not in a standard vector but rather in  which contains an additional RFP after the Spe restriction site, thus a part of 900bp and one of 2k bp is expect when digesting with P
Restriction COMT2, 3 overnight.

All the 6 parts seemed to be self closed Terminator vectors.
The result is probably due to an error in the ligation accompanied with the low probability of taking up a large vector with the size of PAMSCOEFT (10k bp)

Liquid cultures from PEFT, EFT, PAMSCOT and SAMS
[ edit ] Sunday
Vanilla experiment take 3!
Transfered 1:100 to new LB cultures containing tyrosine or ferrulic acid or vanillin
All had a concentration of 5 mg/L, vanillin was used to determine if vanillin remained stabile in e.coli (or perhaps was converted to another product)
Ferrulic acid and vanillin were dissolved in alcohol at 10 mg/ml
Resulting experiments:
EFT+ Vanillin
PEFT + Ferrulic accid (2x)
EFT + Ferrulic acid (2)
PAMSCOT + Tyrosine (2x)
SAMS + Tyrosine (2x)
At the start of the experiment, samples were taken
The next day the samples were taken to the HPLC for measurements.
