Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
the strenght of the promoter was tested following the protocol from the standard promoter measurement kit from iGEM. this can be found on the parts registry.
liquid cultures of blp+gfp in the pBR322 vector were made to redo our experiment.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
No colonies on both plates
best to give up on PAMSCOEFT ligation at this point since the end is nearing
Made liquid cultures of EFT, PEFT, PAMSCOT and SAMS for the second vanilla experiment
