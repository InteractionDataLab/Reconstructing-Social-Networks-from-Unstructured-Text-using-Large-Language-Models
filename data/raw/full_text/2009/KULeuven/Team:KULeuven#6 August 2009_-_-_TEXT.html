Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
Primers for the blue light receptor have arrived
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Today the purification of the gel electrophoresis was done on the cells from yesterday.  Nanodrop concentrations:
A1, sam5: 11,6 ng/ul
A2, sam8: 5,5 ng/ul
B2, COMT:  24,3 ng/ul
C1, fcs:  16,6 ng/ul
C2, ech:  16,9 ng/ul
A1 and A2 showed a very low concentration and the 260/280 value was quite high so both were electrophoresed again. B1 (RBS) had failed because it was too short, however ligating B1 and B2 (COMT) was no longer needed since the part with RBS was available in the iGEM 2009 kit .
A1 and A2 were redigested:
A1: sam8, EcoRI en SpeI
A2: sam5, EcoRI en XbaI
followed by gel electrophoresis
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
VirA, virB, virG and rpoA were purified and nanodropped
All the genes were elongated with polyA-tails to make it possible to insert them into a TOPO-vector
