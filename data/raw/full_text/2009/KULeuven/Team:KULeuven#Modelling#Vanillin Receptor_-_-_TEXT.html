Vanillin Sensor
Overview
The vanillin receptor senses the vanillin concentration outside the cell. This information is needed to create the feedback loop to control vanillin synthesis. Under influence of vanillin, Vir A gets autophosphorylated and phosphorylates on its turn Vir G. Vir G then triggers the transcription of Anti-key.
Models
Vanillin diffusion
Because VirA senses the vanillin concentration in the cytoplasm, we showed that the extracellular concentration equals the intracellular concentration of vanillin for all our purposes. vanillin_sensing
VirA is a transmembrane sensory protein kinase that phosphorylates VirG. It's triggered by phenols, monosaccharides and acid
