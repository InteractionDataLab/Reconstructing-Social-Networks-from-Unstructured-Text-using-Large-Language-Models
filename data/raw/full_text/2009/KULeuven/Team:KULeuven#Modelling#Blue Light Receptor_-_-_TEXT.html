Blue light Sensor
Overview
The purpose of the sensor is to enter the wanted vanillin concentration. Under the influence of the intensity of a blue light, the RIBOKEY is transcribed. The light used to perform the test has a wavelength of 470nm.
The biology works as follows:
YcgF protein is believed to dimerize upon photo-excitation. The YcgE protein functions as a repressor for the transcription of the mRNA_RIBOKEY. However, the dimer form of YcgF is capable of interacting with the operator-bound YcgE, thereby releasing it from the DNA and starting transcription.
Models
