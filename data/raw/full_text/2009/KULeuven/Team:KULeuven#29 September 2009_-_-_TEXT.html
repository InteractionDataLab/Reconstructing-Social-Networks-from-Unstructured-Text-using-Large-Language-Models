Progress of parts
[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
we redid the experiment from 24/09 but only grew cultures at 25°C. we did split up the cultures into two groups, 16°c and 25°C and each group had some cultures that were lit and some dark.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Nanodrop of the six cultures of PAMSCOEFT

Restriction digest & Gel electrophorese
All the 6 parts seemed to be self closed Terminator vectors.
The result is probably due to an error in the ligation accompanied with the low probability of taking up a large vector with the size of PAMSCOEFT (10k bp)
[ edit ] Vanillin Receptor
electropoation of virA was succesfull so it was ented
virB was ented from the motherplate
[ edit ] Key/Lock/Anti-Key
We finally received the lock and the antisense key from geneart.
Electroporation and plating out the two components.
