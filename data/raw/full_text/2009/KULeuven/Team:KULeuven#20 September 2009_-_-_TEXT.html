[ edit ] Blue Light Receptor
the elecroporation from saterday was not succesfull for logA but there was a colony on the likA plates. this was reented and a liquid culture was made to miniprepp and check.
the restriction digest from saterday was put on gel and checked. all but one lane had good signal. a gel extraction was done with following results: ligA: 4,8ng/µl ; pBR322: 12,3ng/µl and pSB3K3: 14,3ng/µl (allw with good 260/280 values). pSB3K3 and ligA were used to perform a new ligation (likA)
the overenting of logA on tc/ap plates from saterday was succesfull. the cultures only grew on the tc plates.  the liquid cultures that were made from these logA's were miniprepped with following results: logA(1): 59,1ng/µl and logA(2): 91,5ng/µl. a restriction digest with EcoRI and PstI was done and put on gel. the signal however showed that only one of the enzymes cut properly. the signal was however on the right height. a new restriction digest will be performed on monday.
a liquid culture of ligY mother plate was made for glycerol stock.
[ edit ] Vanillin Production
Transfered colonies to liquid culture, there were no more Ap plates so only liquid cultures.
from PEFT 1 UV 8 colonies
from PEFT 2 UV 4 colonies
From PEFT 1 4 colonies
From PEFT 2 4 colonies
Double electroporation of PAMS&CO (UV and no UV)
But no plates, so there was only a small line on the plate
