</LI></UL><UL><LI>Transformations worked the 2nd time round with commercial Nova Blue E.coli Strain. DNA samples in toolkit must be of low concentrations!

</LI></UL><UL><LI>PCR worked. PCR products (3 candidate proteins)ligated onto biobrick backbones pSB1A3 and pSB1A2 (contains RBS BBa_J61100).
</LI></UL><UL><LI>The plasmid backbones with the genes of interest inserted into them were used to transform the XL1-BLUE E.coli strain (although not competent enough compared to NovaBlue cells they are much cheaper!!)
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Most transformations are successful. Used transformed colonies to prepare liquid cultures so that we can proceed with minipreping them.

</LI></UL><UL><LI>Developed the design for a Bioscaffold-Linker transformer family (inspired by Bioscaffolds). Should allow fusions of proteins and all RFC10 biobricks in-frame after using Bioscaffold specific restriction enzymes.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Prepared different versions of this Bioscaffold to be ordered and tested in the lab for actual functionality.

Unfortunately we couldn't get any of the 3 proteins on the pSB1A2 backbone.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Seems that overxpression of these proteins on pSB1A2 is unfavourable for the cells. Hence decided to replace the existing promoter with an inducible one of our choice such  as the AraC promoter.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Promoter removed from pSB1A2 and religated. Fiu still not able to be ligated on any of the two backbones. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>In the meantime the two parts comprising of the AraC promoter were extracted from the iGEM kit plates and used to transform NovaBlue competent cells. Also liquid cultures of the transformed cells were prepared.

</LI></UL><UL><LI> Culture colonies of BBa_B0014 transformants to get ready for mini prep.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> PCR FhuA and GFP for assembling together a quick and dirty fusion to be ready prior to BioScaffold arrival.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Carried out colony growth (agar &amp; liquid) for the AraC promoter (2 parts BBa_R0080 (lacking O2 region) and BBa_R0081 (the O2 region). 
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Miniprepped DNA from cultures of BBa_R0080 and R0081.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Attempted a 2-way ligation and of the BBa_R0080 and R0081 parts. The final product should be a 2-component biobrick on a plasmid in 5'-R0081-R0080-3' direction which can be transformed into cells.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> R0081 part was purified by gel extraction after being treated by double digest. R0080 and R0081 were ligated together and used to transform NovaBlue cells.

</LI></UL><UL><LI> The aim is to check whether a cargo protein like GFP will be transported to vesicles by one of our carrier proteins of interest like FhuA. It should be completed more quickly than the other method(at least in principle).
</LI></UL><UL><LI> It can also be used as a back up in case the bioscaffold method does not work.
