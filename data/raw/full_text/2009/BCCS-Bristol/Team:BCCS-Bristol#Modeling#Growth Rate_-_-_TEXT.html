Growth Rate of the Bacterium
It has been shown that the growth rate of single bacteria is a trilinear function. Click here for a link to the paper.
This means that the growth of the bacterium can be divided into 3 phases.
Phase 1
From time zero, T_0, to the time when formation of the septum begins, T_c.
Phase 2
From the time when formation of the septum begins, T_c, to the time T_2.
Phase 3
From the time T_2 to the generation time, T_g.
At each phase there is an individual linear growth rate, or gradient, a. Values for the parameters are shown in the table below:
Parameter *

a_1

a_2

T_c

* Times are in minutes and growth rates are in micrometres/minute.
