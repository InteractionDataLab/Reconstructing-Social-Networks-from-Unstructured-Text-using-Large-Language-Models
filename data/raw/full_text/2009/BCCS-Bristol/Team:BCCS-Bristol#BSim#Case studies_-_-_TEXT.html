VESECURE
The analysis of our work on OMVs can be found here .
Magnetotaxis
The results from experiments carried out into magnetotactic bacteria with BSim 2009 can be found here . This includes a video of magnetotactic bacteria as well as results of experiments into the average velocity of the bacteria and a comparison of magnetotaxis with chemotaxis.
Repressilators
An overview of the findings from BSim 2009 can be seen here . This includes some background on repressilators and investigations into coupled repressilators with the results we found and further work that we are going to carry out in this area.
