iGEM 2009
BSim allows the user to specify the actions and interactions present between different elements in the simulation. As an example of a simple interaction we would like to detect when collisions occur between two bacteria, since this is most likely to be the basis upon which we decide whether any further action is taken by the bacteria. The video below shows an example of this. When two bacteria collide their colour changes from green to red.
To create this simulation in BSim see the tutorials page . The collisions can be logged to an external file as well as displayed visually as they are here. As can be seen from the tutorial example, adding new actions based on collisions would be a matter of extending the interaction method with a few lines of code!
