What we did
Nick Tschernia
Entered the Nevada Team into the iGEM Competition a week before the submission date.
Organized weekly meetings for project brainstorming and time line.
Recruited the iGEM Team through a highly selective process (whoever was left at the end of the brainstorming sessions).
Helped petition for research and travel funds.
Organized the source plate distribution and transformation of the basic parts.
Sequence analysis of the Biobrick parts formed.
Primer design for adding Biobrick restriction sites for formation of Biobrick parts.
Assisted in an advisory role to all aspects of the project.
Janice Cho
Formulated the original idea of using cinnamaldehyde as a mosquito larvicide.
Performed initial research on the use of cinnamaldehyde.
Helped perform a three-way ligation with part BBa_R0011 (lacI promoter), part BBa_B0034 (ribosome-binding site), and part pSB3C5 (chloramphenicol resistant backbone) to create part BBa_K262000.
Helped conduct a three-way ligation to create final construct with the parts: BBa_K262000 and BBa_K262002.
Leigh Armijo
Helped perform a three-way ligation with part BBa_R0011 (lacI promoter), part BBa_B0034 (ribosome-binding site), and part pSB3C5 (chloramphenicol resistant backbone) to create part BBa_K262000.
Helped conduct a three-way ligation to create a construct with BBa_K262000, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, and BBa_B0014.
Sheena Jones
In charge of maintaining and propagating Wolffia and Lemna Minor plant species.
Generated callus culture in preparation for gene transformation.
Tony Moschetti
Topo-cloned cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (gene 3)for preparation of a Biobrick part.
Made Biobrick part containing cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (gene 3) and double terminator (BBa_K262002)
Transformed 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (gene 2) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (gene 3 - BBa_K262001) into Biobrick backbones.
J Malikowski
Induced expression in non-Biobrick expression vector containing 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (gene 2). Detection of product formation at 311nm. Further studies will be conducted in the near future.
Helped to troubleshoot minipreps and other protocols. Resident expert on minipreps.
Trained Tyler to be an excellent Molecular Biologist.
Advisory role at lab meetings (How does the Harper lab do it?)
Tyler Peterson
Major player in media preparation, agarose gels, stock solutions
Helped with minipreps and E. coli transformation.
Chris Martinez
Made db3.1 and NEB10 competent cells.
Overall goal was to up-regulate the cinnamaldehyde pathway in plants Wolffia and various Lemna Minor species
Transformation of cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase (Gene 3) into TOPO D Vector
Used LR CLonase Protocal to move cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase (Gene 3) into pK7WG2D.1 Binary Vector which will be used to grow up Agrobacterium, which will be used to infect the plants Wolffia and Lemna Minor species
Joey Khwaja
Made db3.1 and NEB10 competent cells.
Transformation of cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase (Gene 3) into TOPO D Vector
Assisted others on various projects including Gene2/Terminator part creation and attempts of the final construct 3-way ligation.
Researched and began design of a Biobrick plant transformation binary vector.
Designed the iGEM Nevada Team shirts.
Chad Sanada
Assisted Nick with designing Biobrick compatible primers and helped to direct and organize the amplification and cloning of cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase (Gene 3) in order to make our first biobrick part.
Added insight into experimental methods and approaches when possible.
Helped prevent Nick from going insane.
Assisted with reviewing and editing the team wiki site.
