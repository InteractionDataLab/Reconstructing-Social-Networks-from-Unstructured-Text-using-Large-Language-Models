Cinnamaldehyde is a natural insecticide against mosquito larvae that shows low toxicity towards other organisms. The objective of this project is to engineer the cinnamaldehyde biosynthetic pathway into <I>E. coli</I> to develop an inexpensive and readily available source of this compound. By introducing the genes encoding phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (gene 1), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (gene 2), and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (gene 3), it should be possible to produce cinnamaldehyde from available phenylalanine in <I>E. coli</I>. Once we have demonstrated that we can produce cinnamaldehyde in <I>E. coli</I>, we will engineer cinnamaldehyde production in duckweed (<I>Wolffia</I> or <I>Lemna</I> species), a small aquatic plant. Because mosquito larvae feed on duckweed detritus, the engineered plant will serve as an excellent vehicle to deliver cinnamaldehyde for mosquito control.

</LI><LI>public safety, or
</LI><LI>environmental safety?
</LI></UL><P>	At this point in the project, it will not raise any safety concerns in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety.  Future portions of this project pertaining to transformation of <I>E. coli</I> and duckweed could raise environmental issues and proper containment monitoring will need to be addressed.
<B>Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?</B>
Yes, there is an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at our institution which is part of the Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&amp;S) program. We also collaborated with Scott Munsen of the Washoe County Vector Control Program.
<B>What does your local biosafety group think about your project?</B>
Our local biosafety group approved our project design and subsequent facilitation of research. Scott Munsen of the Washoe County Vector Control Program believes this could be a feasible pest control and will aid in the larvicidal tests of cinnamaldehyde against various mosquito species to verify its larvicidal activity and to ensure we are not harming non-target organisms.
<B>Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?</B>
No, none of our new BioBrick parts that we made this year raise any safety issues.  The genes we are using are naturally occurring genes expressed in plants and other organisms that do not pose any risk.

Current insecticides being used which include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), organophosphates, and others, cause environmental damage to non-target organisms, including humans.  Many mosquito species gain resistance to these insecticides, so new ways to combat mosquitoes that transmit human diseases need to be produced. In order to replace these general synthetic insecticides, our proposed project is to produce a natural, low toxicity mosquito larvicide through the production of cinnamaldehyde.  Finding a cost-effective, environmentally friendly manner to manage mosquito populations is a key aim of this project.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Goal_1"> Goal 1 </SPAN></H3><P>Develop a mathematical model to predict pathway flux based on enzyme kinetic values and levels of gene expression.  The information obtained from this model will help rationalize engineering design choices to optimize cinnamaldehyde production in <I>E.coli</I>.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experiment_and_Results_for_Goal_1"> Experiment and Results for Goal 1</SPAN></H3><P>1. Using Mathematica, a model was developed to describe Michaelis-Menten steady-state kinetics for the engineered cinnamaldehyde biosynthetic pathway.  The published Km and Vmax values for the plant enzyme, phenylalanine-ammonia lyase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (feruloyl-CoA reductase), were used to build our model. Using wild type kinetic parameters and the assumption that all three enzymes were present in equal amounts, the model predicted that a biosynthetic bottleneck will occur at 4-coumarate:CoA ligase. This problem appears to be primarily due to the high Km value of the enzyme for its substrate cinnamic acid. Therefore, we used the model to test two possible means of increasing pathway flux: 1) increasing 4-coumarate:CoA ligase levels and 2) decreasing 4-coumarate:CoA ligaseâs Km for cinnamic acid. The results produced from the model showed that by increasing the 4-coumarate:CoA ligase concentration ten-fold relative to the other enzymes in the pathway, or by decreasing the Km forty-fold, the barrier could be bypassed in this way. the results of these studies are shown in the Modeling Section of our Team Wiki.

Based on information obtained from our modeling studies, it is clear that the wild type plant 4-coumarate-CoA ligase has a very low affinity (i.e. high Km) for its substrate cinnamic acid. Fortunately we found an article published by Dr. Kombrink from the Max Planck Institute in Munchen, Germany that described the engineering of a  4-coumarate-CoA ligase with a forty fold decreased Km for cinnamic acid. Dr. Kombrink has generously provided us with the gene encoding this enzyme for use in this project.
