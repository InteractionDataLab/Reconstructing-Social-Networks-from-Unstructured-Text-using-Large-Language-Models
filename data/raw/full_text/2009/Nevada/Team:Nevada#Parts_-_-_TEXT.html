Registry Parts Used
New Parts Added to Registry
Promoters:
Ribosome Binding Site:
Terminators:
Intermediates:
LacI
RBS (Elowitz 1999)
Bidirectional Double Terminator
LacI + RBS
Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 2 Gene + Double Terminator
Registry Parts Used
LacI: We used this strong IPTG-inducible promoter from the part registry. For more information go to: BBa_R0011
RBS: We used this ribosome binding site (based on Elowitz repressilator) from the part registry. It has a relative efficiency of 1. For more information go to: BBa_B0034
Bidirectional Double Terminator: We used this Bidirectional Double Terminator from the part registry. Allows for the cessation of translation and the development of a protein expression system. For more information go to: BBa_B0014
New Parts Added to Registry
LacI/RBS: We created an IPTG-Inducible promoter and efficient RBS intermediate from existing basic parts within the registry. Allows for the development of an inducible protein expression system. For more information go to: BBa_K262000
Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 2 Gene + Double Terminator: We created a new intermediate part for the registry. This intermediate will allow for the development of a Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 2 enzyme expression system. For more information go to: BBa_K262002
