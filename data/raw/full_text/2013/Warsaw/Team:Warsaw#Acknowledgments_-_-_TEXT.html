Acknowledgments
We would like to thank all of the people that helped us throughout the project, gave us motivation as well as priceless time to teach us, and paid a lot of attention to our project.
We would especially like to thank our sponsors, without their support we wouldn't even be here!!
We are grateful to our University , for all the help that was given to us, as well as to it's cadre, without whom we wouldn't be able to attend the conference with almost every person from our team and wouldn't manage to get all the paperwork done!
As some of us are in the laboratory for the first time, we would especially like to thank our mentors, teachers, as well as our everyday laboratory guides to whom we are grateful for all the time they spent guiding us throughout this project. We are especially thankful to Jakub Piątkowski and dr Roman Szczęsny (PhD).
We thank PWN that made it possible for us to have a new kind of Human Practice and the cadre with which our cooperation was very fruitful!
We would like to give special thanks to the portal biotechnologia.pl that helped us reach a wide audience with articles that were published on their portal.
All of the persons that helped us in every possible way and to whom we are grateful are listed here:
