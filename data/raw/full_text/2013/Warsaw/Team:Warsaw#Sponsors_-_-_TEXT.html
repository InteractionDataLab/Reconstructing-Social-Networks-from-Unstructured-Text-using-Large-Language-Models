Generacja Przyszłości
Acknowledgment of our first grant
We are proud to announce that in May the Minister of Science and Higher Education, Professor Barbara Kudrycka, acknowledged us a grant called 'Generacja Przyszłości' (-Eng. 'Generation of the Future'). This allowed us to start our preparations. Thanks to this grant we were able to start working in the laboratory and pay for our equipment and reagents. We were very happy that our application was chosen, thanks to this grant we could pay for our team registration and attend the IGEM Jamboree. If you want to hear our adventure with a regulation that was created for researchers that are working in Poland we kindly invite you here!
