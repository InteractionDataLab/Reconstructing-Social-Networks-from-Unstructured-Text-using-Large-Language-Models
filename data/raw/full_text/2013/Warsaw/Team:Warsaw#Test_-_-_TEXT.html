Vision
Gene silencing is a fundamental technique in biology. It is currently a time-consuming process restricted to nonessential genes and a few bacteria. For more perspectives and possible solutions go to project vision .
Project
In this project a novel small RNA technology for gene silencing in bacteria is developed. We applied bioinformatics, experimental biology and mathematical modeling. For a full description go to project overview .
Background
To help you understand the science of the project important concepts are explained. This covers small RNA, synthetic biology and more advanced topics. To get informed go to background .
This project is part of iGEM
