Generacja Przyszłości
We are proud to announce that in May the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Professor Barbara Kudrycka acknowledged us a grant called 'Generacja Przyszłości' (-Eng. 'Generation of the Future'). Which allowed us to start our preparations. Thanks to this grant We were able to start working in the laboratory and pay for our equipment and reagents. We were very happy that our application was chosen, thanks to this grant we could pay for our team registration! We are grateful as the persons that are on that grant can attend the IGEM Jamboree. If you want to hear our adventure with a regulation that was created for researchers that are working in Poland we kindly invite you here!
