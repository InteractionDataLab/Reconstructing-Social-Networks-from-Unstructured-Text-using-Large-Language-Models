Requirements for a Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2013 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of, and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function), of a previously existing BioBrick part in the 'Experience' page of that part's Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Registry. Part Number(s):
K1093000 - sfBFP (Superfolder Blue Fluorescent Protein)
K1093001 - sfYFP (Superfolder Yellow Fluorescent Protein)
K1093002 - sfCFP (Superfolder Cyan Fluorescent Protein)

Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We measured our superfolder proteins and they are fluorescent as we expected.
Document the characterization of this part in the 'Main Page' of that Part's/Device's Registry entry
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)

Acknowledgment of sources and references
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.

Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal (one OR more)
We believe this year we have successfully fulfilled all of the three Gold Medal criteria described below.
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the 'Experience' section of that Parts's Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
The Registry improves not only when users submit great new parts but also when they improve existing parts. For more information see: 2013.igem.org/Judging/Awards
Part Number(s):
K1093000 - blue fluorescence, improvment of BFP (superfolder form)
K1093001 - yellow fluorescence, improvment of YFP (superfolder form)
K1093002 - cyan fluorescence, improvment od CFP (superfolder form)
Superfolder forms of fluorescent proteins are known that are more stable and have stronger fluorescence than non-superfolder forms.
K1093002 - we measure this BioBrick (designed by Team Uppsala 2012) and compare it to our sfYFP.

Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Link to page on your team's wiki: Cooperation with other iGEM teams
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
We created the first polish manual for Synthetic Biology ("Geny i Maszyny" - eng. "Genes and Machines") with cooperation with PWN - See more
We took part in the polish Night of Biologists, Science Picnic and Festival of Science. We popularized iGEM and Synthetic Biology - See more
We cooperated with mass media - See more
This project is part of iGEM
