A
acrylamide – our subject of study
B
BiFC – Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation
C
cloning – on pSB1C3 of course!
calm resignation – general mood two days prior to wiki freeze (see 'panic attack')
mCherry - red fluorescent protein. We managed to succesfully clone C- and N-terminal BiFC fragments into pSB1C3 and deliver them to the Registry
D
despair - general mood week prior to wiki freeze (see 'calm resignation')
E
ethanol – lots of ethanol in cell lab (take a deep breath ladies and gentelmen - unless one of you is the designated driver)
F
FedEx - delivery services, which tried to take our precious samples, results of our hard work
FluoSafe – our project
G
Airport de Gaulle'a - the place, where our parts got held up a few hours too long
Generacja Przyszłości (eng. Generation of the Future) – our grant
H
HeLa and HEK – cells we worked with
hemoglobin - core of our sensor
I
irritation - when this **** C-m6 and C-m12 cannot clone in pSB1C3 plasmid!
J
Jamboree - we're waiting for it
K
kill-switch - our safety system which wasn't synthetized on time (see: 'lysis device' and 'MinC')
L
Lyon - we can send you postcard from jamboree
lysis device - another component of our kill-switch (see: 'MinC')
M
MinC - core of our kill-switch. Inhibits bacterial division.
N
N-terminal valine - acrylamide forms adducts on the N-terminus of hemoglobin alpha and beta chains. Adducts interfere with tetramer formation. We attempted to take advantage of this property while designing the hemoglobin-based acrylamide sensor.
O
mOrange - we nearly managed to produce BiFC fragments form this fluorescent protein
P
PCR – polymerase chain reaction
panic attack – begins approximately 12 h prior to wiki freeze
Q
questionable - large portion of our clones and PCR products
R
roGFP - redox-sensitive GFP
S
superfolder proteins - improved derivatives of A. victoria-based fluorescent proteins (green, yellow, blue and cyan). This part of our project actually succeded. They're brighter, fun to work with and considerably more stable (as a poet once said: 'harder, better, faster, stronger' - and our work with them still isn't over)
T
Toolbox (BiFC's) - one of our goals
U
ultraviolet - and GFP glows
The Unknown Sample - not all abbreviations are as obvious now as there were a month ago...
V
vacation - in lab all the time!
W
wirówka (eng. centrifuge) – that we unintentionally broke!
wiki freeze – the ultimate deadline (see: "despair', 'calm resignation' and 'panic attack')
X
X-Files - paranormal no longer seems impressive, once you've seen some of our results...
Y
yellow fluorescent proteins (sfYFP and SYFP2) - and their glowing rivalry!
Z
Zombie walk - team departs the lab following wiki freeze
