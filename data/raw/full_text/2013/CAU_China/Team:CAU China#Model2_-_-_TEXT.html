We use comentrophy to evaluate the variation at each position of alcohol dehydrogenase, our engineering template. Comentrophy is a quantity with a value ranging from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the more variable the position is during the evolution. Here the figure describes the comentrophy value at each position of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase.
Where,pm is the possibility of the occurance of any amino acid at a specific position.
