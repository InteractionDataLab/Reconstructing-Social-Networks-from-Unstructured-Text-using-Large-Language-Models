Safety
On 2nd/3rd July, we held 12 workshops aimed at children between the ages 11-14. During the workshops, we got the kids to think about the structure of DNA and the applications they'd like synthetic biology to be used for in the future. The ethical implications of SynBio were also discussed.
SCIENCE STARS
On 6th July, the university opened its doors to the general public for its annual Community Open Day, where this year we had a poster and stall! Over 700 people in total visited throughout the day, and we made sure to engage passers-by in conversation about iGEM and synthetic biology in general.
