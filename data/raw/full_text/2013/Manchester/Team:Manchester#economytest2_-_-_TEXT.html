When doing the initial research for our synthetic alternative to palm oil components, we quickly came across lots of information regarding the current palm oil industry. It soon became apparent that the economies of some countries, for example Indonesia and Malaysia, depend almost entirely upon the current methods of palm oil production. Therefore we compiled a detailed impact analysis report for synthetic palm oil, which can be found by clicking on the button to the right.
Synthetic Palm Oil Is Not All Good News
Our project has the potential to cause detrimental economic effects to those individuals who rely on the naturally grown palm oil for contributing to household income.
The palm oil industries in Malaysia and Indonesia are of great significance. In Malaysia alone 25.24billion USD was gained through the exporting of palm oil and related products to foreign countries in 2011[1]
The palm oil industry and its subsidiaries provide considerable amounts of employment in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Malaysia for instance 2.26 million people are involved, either directly or indirectly, in the palm oil industry[2]. A further 14 million individuals are involved with this industry in Indonesia[3].
With the introduction of a synthetic alternative to organic palm oil, we fear that there will be no need for plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia to go on existing and producing palm oil. Thus, potentially, forcing millions into unemployment.
