Introduction
Since the model of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathways highlighted several key enzymes that could be altered to produce palm oil, including Delta9, Delta12 and FabA, which agrees with previous publications on these enzymes. Delta9 and Delta12 are involved in linear pathways, meaning that there are obvious reactants and products, so the overexpression of them can be measured directly via LC-MS and other techniques. However, FabA is a β-Hydroxydecanoyl Thiol Ester Dehydrase involved in a cyclic pathway [1] specifically the conversion of β-hydroxy acyl-ACP to Enol acyl-ACP as part of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway [2].
