Exams are over and we’ve officially started full-time work on the project! At the start of the week we had a big group meeting, complete with instructors and advisors, and were presented with our very own pins and stickers set. The pins quickly vanished, but we held on to the stickers for an Outreach activity we have in the pipeline (more on that on the Outreach page!). We took advantage of the rare sunshine and had our first (almost) group photo taken, to go in an article in the uni newsletter (and to also reveal what Team Manchester looks like to the rest of the world). We were introduced to our beautiful lab space, and are all really eager to get our hands/gloves dirty!  </P><P>The wiki designers have begun tweaking the page to make it a little more presentable for the masses and, apart from a little accident where Ali’s face was pasted over everyone else’s on the Team page, it’s going quite swimmingly!</P><P>After quickly realising that biology is SO COMPLEX, the main bulk of the team began an intensive literature search, looking for anything and everything that may be of use to us in the following weeks. We’ve located a BioBrick that we would really love to use and attempt to improve, but are having doubts about whether or not it is available for us to order. Hope so, or it’s back to square one! Fingers crossed.</P><P>Preliminary modelling research has also begun. None of the team has firsthand experience of modelling biology, so this should be interesting. We’re currently scouring the internet and some 1970s handbooks in search of kinetic information for the enzymes involved in prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis. One small step for man and all that. Wish us luck!</P></DIV></LI><LI id="two"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text1'); return false;">Week 2</A><DIV id="text1"><P> Week 2 in the Manchester iGEM house... (that’s old now, I won’t use it again.)
This has been a busy week for the less sciencey aspects of the project. We finalised our team logo, made a great poster for a Community open day we will be attending in July, and made the final changes to the sponsor packet we will be sending out soon. The team attempted to split into two subteams: core experimental team and core modelling team. Despite working on these two separate things, the group still managed to come together regularly to update the others on any progress made. Both experimental and modelling research started in Week 1 was built upon, and we feel that we are at least going in the right direction! </P><P>We put a request in for 3 BioBricks from the Repository, and are eagerly awaiting a response. Lab work will start soon. To begin with it will just be building up a stock of media and plates etc, but it will make the lab feel more like home. Which is good, because we plan on living there for the next 10 weeks.</P><P>We also met with Dr. Andy Balmer to have a chat about Human Practices. There was so much we hadn’t thought about! He definitely gave us a few things to consider, and we set a date for another meeting in Week 3. Following the meeting we thought it would be a good idea to appoint a Head of Human Practices and a Head of Ethics on the team, which fell to Rob and Tan respectively (congrats on your new job, here is a cake).</P><P>5 of the team will be visiting London in July for the first ever Young Synthetic Biologists meet-up! Accommodation and travel has already been paid, so now it’s just a matter of waiting for the day to come. We’ll be there with bells on (and also with a soil sample, at Norwich iGEM’s request!)</P></DIV></LI><LI id="three"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text2'); return false;">Week 3</A><DIV id="text2"><P>This week we started thinking about our FadD knockout. After a meeting about primer design with our new supervisor, Jay; we found the gene sequence, worked out our primers and put them to order! Later in the week we had another meeting with Andy Balmer, which once again gave us a lot to think about. We’ve had a few lightbulb moments and we’re pretty excited to get stuck in! Back in the lab we found out that we didn’t have any supplies, but after a quick shopping trip we ended up with plenty of supplies...ok a LOT of supplies (Not sure if we’re going to get through 3000 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes). </P><P>Unfortunately, our first attempt at transformation failed, but to raise our spirits we had our first iGEM social! Divita cooked the team a fantastic curry, and we had a great time. The food adventures continued the next day when Elsa brought in some Icelandic dried fish: certainly something different! </P><P>Meanwhile all through the week, the modelling team have been doing a great job making the experimental team look bad. They’ve been learning how to use Copasi (made here in Manchester!) and are cross-referencing the data ready to start simulation.  </P></DIV></LI><LI id="four"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text3'); return false;">Week 4</A><DIV id="text3"><P> Week 4 started off slowly, but by the end things were really starting to come together. We realised that the pkd46 plasmid we were trying to transform is heat sensitive, so heat-shocking and incubating at 37C really wasn’t the best idea! Instead we tried electroporation, which we managed to do first time, with some successful colonies! Hopefully the rest of the fadD knockout will now run smoothly. </P><P>After realising just how expensive biology can be, we’ve started to make a big push on the sponsorship front. So far this has led to some free kits from QIAGEN and a promotion for Ralf, who was addressed as Dr Wenz. </P><P>Unfortunately this week we also had to say goodbye to Ali and Johanna, who need to spend time on other projects. Luckily we can say hello to Marco (who will be helping in the lab) and Denis (who’s now in charge of designing our wiki. It’s good to have a computer scientist on the team!). </P><P>As you can see it’s been a fairly quiet week, but with our upcoming public outreach events and YSB 1.0, we’ve got a busy fortnight ahead of us!</P></DIV></LI></UL><LI id="one"><A href="" onclick="blocking('submenu2'); return false;">July</A></LI><LI id="one"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text4'); return false;">Week 5</A><DIV id="text4"><P> This week has certainly been a mix of ups and downs! On Tuesday and Wednesday the outreach team ran 12 workshops for children aged 11-13 at the university’s Science Stars event. They taught the children about the structure of DNA by getting them to create a DNA molecule from Mario sweets (Mario pairs to Yoshi, Donkey Kong to Diddy Kong) and strawberry pencils. The activity was received amazingly well by the children and teachers alike. We also taught them about what synthetic biology is, and asked them to think what ideas they’d have as well as the ethical implications associated with them. Some of the ideas were phenomenal, and some were let’s say...a little more abstract. The team is doing the workshop again at the Community Open Day on Saturday, where they’ll be bringing SynBio to the wider public!</P><P>Unfortunately, experimental progress has been plagued by admin issues, delaying us from getting the FAS module and our primers. On the plus side our electrocompetent bacterial colonies were successful, meaning our Court-Lamba recombinase knockout of the fadD gene is ready for the next step! Now we just need our primers. Modelling have had a bit more success, but both subteams have had issues with finding the source for delta-9-desaturase. Fortunately, this was more or less resolved by the end of the week!</P><P>We also had another social! Elsa cooked the team a delicious vegetarian lasagna, we found out more about Jess’ love of rodents, and Rob tried (and failed) to do Bhangra dancing. </P><P>Next week most of the team is off to YSB 1.0 in London. We’re really looking forward to meeting the other UK iGEM teams!</P></DIV></LI><LI id="two"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text5'); return false;">Week 6</A><DIV id="text5"><P> This has been a very exciting week of collaborations for us! At the start of the week we had a Google hangout with Perdue to discuss their idea to standardise entry of parts into the registry. It emerged that there are many issues raised when it comes to standardising modelling. We agreed to help them with this. By the end of the week, this had somewhat grown...</P><P>On Thursday we headed off to London for the very first Young Synthetic Biologists (YSB) conference. This was a big meeting of all the UK iGEM teams. On the first day we listened to presentations from each team in the morning. The afternoon featured workshops covering topics such as public engagement, business startups and bioart. </P><P>The second day brought big news to the team. After our presentation, we had a lot of interest in our model. This led to a huge collaboration with 8 other UK teams:  Edinburgh, Westminster, Dundee, Newcastle, UCL, York and (maybe) Imperial. Our plan is two fold:</P><P>1) Relating to the collaboration with Perdue, we are going to write some standardised pieces of code for use in the majority of the software. Also we would consider what essential pieces of information are needed for submission of a model. The idea being that one day we could have a standard registry for models. This is already being planned by iGEM, but we can use this project to provide feedback with what we'd want from it. </P><P>2) An idea of a page that gives teams an introduction to the modelling on the iGEM website in the same way we have intros to the lab work. This would involve video tutorials on the main programmes used in iGEM. Other teams liked the idea and would consider doing one for the software they are using during the summer. Between the 8 teams we have experts in 10 different pieces of software!</P><P>It appears big things could come from this project!</P></DIV></LI><LI id="three"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text6'); return false;">Week 7</A><DIV id="text6"><P>This week’s been a quiet one, but it’s given some fairly substantial progress for the experimental and human practice teams. </P><P>Experimentally, the FAS module arrived from Prof Mattheos Koffas of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. We successfully extracted lots of it (78ng/µl!). This FAS module will help increase fatty acid synthesis in our <I>E. coli</I> so we get a greater yield of product. We are incredibly grateful for Prof Koffas for his generosity in donating this module, as this will be a big help to our project. </P><P>In human practice news, the team first had a meeting with James Leigh, a chemistry PhD student who has worked with the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable. He told the team some advice about how to organise a roundtable for a possible talk with industry we have in mind. It sounds like a lot of work, so we’re not sure if this is going to be a viable idea in the timescale we have left. There was also a meeting with Dr Catherine Rhodes, an expert in science ethics. She made us consider the rights needed to keep the Malaysian and Indonesian economies stable, and possible patenting issues with our project.</P><P>Even more economic progress was made (having Matt on the team was definitely a good decision!). We got concrete figures showing there is a link between palm oil growth and deforestation, that there is going to be a sharp rise in the price of naturally grown palm oil in the future (2020 and to go with this we made a graph to show the increase in Crude Palm Oil prices since 2005, which we plan to extrapolate. </P></DIV></LI><LI id="four"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text7'); return false;">Week 8</A><DIV id="text7"><P>This week finally brought good news in sponsorship! We would like to thank the Hain Daniels Group and Eccelso for their very generous donations to our team! They are very much appreciated and will no doubt help us travel to the European jamboree. </P><P>The experimental team had some frustrations this week (it wouldn’t be real science without them!). After waiting a long time for our primers to arrive, they had some very confusing contamination after our PCR. The next challenge is to work out where it came from! The economics team drew up a list of things that need doing by time the project ends, and there’s lots of work to do! This week they found out that ‘sustainable’ palm oil isn’t as sustainable as you’d think. You can read much more about this on our ethics pages</P><P>At the end of the week we had another iGEM social where we tried the Icelandic delicacy of Hákarl (fermented shark). As you can imagine, it tasted bad but smelled even worse! The vegetable chilli that Jess made the team was much more appetising...</P></DIV></LI><LI id="one"><A href="" onclick="blocking('submenu3'); return false;">August</A></LI><LI id="one"><A href="" onclick="blocking('text8'); return false;">Week 9</A><DIV id="text8">
