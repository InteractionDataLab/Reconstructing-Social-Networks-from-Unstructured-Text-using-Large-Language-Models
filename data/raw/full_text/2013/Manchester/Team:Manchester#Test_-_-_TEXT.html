14/06/2013 - Making media
1. Calculate amount of powder of LB agar or LB broth mix required in accordance with manufacturer's instructions
2. Add LB powder to distilled water (we used 10 g of LB-broth or LB agar to 400ml of water
3. Autoclave the flask ( Make sure you have the autoclave tape on with label)
4. Add any antibiotic if needed once the flask has sufficiently cooled (approx 50 degrees).
19/06/2013 - Preparation of Chemically competent Cells
1. Grow the specific strain (BL21(DE3))on the plate. Plates will be in the incubator.
2. Select a colony from the plate with inoculating loop
3. The colony is dispersed in 100 ml LB broth in a conical flask.
4. The culture is left overnight- vigorous shaking at 37°C
Taking the OD of the grown culture
Want an OD of 0.1 in a culture volume of 100ml
Calculation:
V1 x 3.2 = 100 x 0.1
V1= 3.1 ml
96.9 ml [LB broth] + 3.1 ml [culture] = 100 ml culture with OD of 0.1
5. Take original OD volume of the culture (at 600 nm). Use LB as a blank. N.B: You  need an OD less than 1.5 to measure the density accurately
6. Diluted culture is transferred to sterile flask. This is placed in shaking incubator at  37°C. After an hour, the OD is measured 15 minutes until it reaches the range of 0.4- 0.6
7. Centrifuge at 6000 xg for 10 min or 5500 xg for 15 min in 2 x 50 ml tubes.
8. Remove the supernatant from the tubes. Combine both the pellets and suspend in ice cold 0.1M CaCl2
9. Leave the tube on ice for 30 min.
10. Spin cells at 6000 xg for 10 min or 5500 xg for 15 min and remove supernatant
11. Resuspend the pellet in 4 ml ice cold 0.1 CaCl2
12. Put on ice in cold room overnight
13. Add 1 ml sterile 100% glycerol
14. Make 50 µl aliquot and store at -80°C (after freezing with liquid nitrogen)
