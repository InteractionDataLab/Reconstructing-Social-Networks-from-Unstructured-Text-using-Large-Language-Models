Safety
Key Achievements
• Created three biobricks
• Used an expression vector based on standard parts to successfully characterise biobricks
• Improvement of a biobrick
The mass deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia to make room for oil palm plantations is one of the biggest issues of our time. Not only does it result in the extinction of many endangered species, it’s also having a massive impact on the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. That’s where we come in...
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Promoting safety within the lab, and also within the wider synthetic biology community, is paramount to the success of this research area. Here we consider how lab work can be made as safe as possible, and also how we would ensure our project remains safe if it became a commercial success.
SAFETY
Over the course of the summer we documented our progress weekly, both as a way for the team to remain as organised as possible and also as a way to allow future teams to see how we developed the project through the weeks. Also sometimes it is nice to show off.
NOTEBOOK
Can’t have an iGEM team without a lab book! Here you will find a list of protocols, some general and some more project-specific, that we have been using during the project.
LAB BOOK
We think the work we’ve done during this uncharacteristically hot summer has what it takes to win some medals/prizes! Click here to see our completed Judging Form and a medalling checklist.
JUDGING
Click here to see the list of the BioBricks we have sent in to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, in addition to detailed information about our characterisation.
