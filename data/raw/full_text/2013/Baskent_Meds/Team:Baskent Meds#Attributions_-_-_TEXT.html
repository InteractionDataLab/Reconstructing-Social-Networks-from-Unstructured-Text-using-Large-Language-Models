Collaboration
We provided Itu igem team with biobricks they are going to use from the kit plates, for a double check, of the parts they were having a problem with. We hoped it worked for them. METU iGEM team and our team become very good friends during iGEM preperation. We are both iGEMers from Ankara so in every step, we helped each other very much. Last year we organised a picnic together and this year we went out for a beer and talked about biology, genetics and iGEM. We shared plasmids, we helped each other’s experiments sometimes, our Wİki Maker Burak gave them hand for their wiki page. They help us create equations for our project modelling.  We invited them for this year’s “Study Groups Symposium” in our school and they gave us a presentation about iGEM and their project. Our instructor went to METU for “Synthetic Biology Days” and she gave a presentation about iGEM and our project. So, we know all about each other’s work now and we can’t wait for having fun in Europe Jamboree together. Being in Lyon together will be a great experience for both Ankara teams!
