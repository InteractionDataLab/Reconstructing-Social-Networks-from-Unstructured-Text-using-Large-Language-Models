This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have all of the pages listed in the menu below with the names specified.   PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.

An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The "groupparts" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.

Anti-Legionella Unit
http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1109005
Some Staphylococcus strains produce anti-Legionella peptide. ORF for anti-legionella peptide specifically encodes for a 22 amino acid peptide. Anti-legionella unit is a biobrick for suitable suffix and prefix regions. It contains a PelB leader sequence in the upstream of the anti-legionella peptide ORF to direct the peptide outside the cell. Design Notes: Anti-legionella unit is a biobrick for suitable suffix and prefix regions. It was derived from synthetic oligonucleotides by tandem hybridization reactions, and amplified by PCR. Source: Oligonucleotide sequence of the anti-legionella peptide was obtained from genomic sequence, and sequence of the PelB leader peptide was obtained from iGEM database.
FepA L8T Mutant -composite of Large Diffusion pore for E. coli outer membrane coding sequence with rbs
http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1109000
FepA L8T Mutant -composite of Large Diffusion pore for E. coli outer membrane coding sequence with rbs in the 5' region of ORF. You can clone this part to downstream of a promoter, and fepA L8T mutant protein will be synthesized.
lqs response unit
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1109006:Design The LqsR and LqsS genes have illegal restriction enzyme cutting sites inside their coding regions. So, BBa_K1109002 composite part was amplified with primers having SpeI cutting sites, and cloned into the downstream of a constiutive promoter in the pSB1C3. Source: Source of the subparts are the 2013 DNA Distribution Kit and pNT-1 plasmid(Cellular Microbiology 9(12):2903-2920, 2007.)
LqsR promoter with RBS (our favorite)
http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1109003
LqsR is the gene encoding response regulator component of the legionella quorum sensing (lqs). LqsR promoter region is controlled by its own response regulator LqsR. This composite part contains RBS downstream of the promoter region. When any ORF is cloned to the downstream of this composite part, it can be expressed in response to legionella auto-inducer (LAI-I). Design Notes: LqsR promoter part is a new biobrick with prefix and suffix regions, and RBS (BBa_B0034) was ligated to downstream of it. Source: Legionella pneumophila genomic lqs gene cluster was cloned into pNT-1 plasmid (Cellular Microbiology 9(12):2903-2920, 2007.) LqsR promoter region was amplified by PCR as a biobrick, and ligated with RBS (BBa_B0034).
Anti-Legionella Cassette
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K830000
anti-legionella (Warnericin RK) peptide, which is directed to periplasmic space by pelB leader sequence, and some proteins are transcribed with lqsR promoter.lqsR promoter is activated by phosphorylated lqsR. This provides synthesis of anti-legionella (Warnericin RK) peptide and marker protein in case of lqsA presence in environment. Source Anti-legionella unit synthesized. Other part of this composite is LqsR promoter. And LqsR promoter region was amplified by PCR as a biobrick, and ligated with RBS (BBa_B0034).And other part is in the igem 2013 distrubution kit plates.
FepA L8T Mutant -composite of Large Diffusion pore for E. coli outer membrane coding sequence transc
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1109007
FepA L8T Mutant -composite of Large Diffusion pore for E. coli outer membrane coding sequence transcription casette This region contains febA L8T protein which is responsible from diffusion of synthesized proteins through cell membrane to outside of cell. It is transcribed with constitutive promoter. By this means, diffusion of proteins which are in periplasmic space is provided by generating pores on the outer membrane of the double layered membrane structure Source: Igem 2013 distribution kit
