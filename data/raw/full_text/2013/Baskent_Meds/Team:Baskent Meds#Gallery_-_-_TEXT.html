1. Our school is organising a “symposium” every year and little med student groups are presenting their whole year studies about a project they chose. In 2012 and 2013 we participate in it as BaskentMeds by presenting our iGEM project. First year was the beginning, second year we told the story of our progress and we introduce iGEM competition to our friends and teacher in Baskent University School of Medicine.
2. We went for a little trip in İstanbul this summer for sharing our experiences with the ITU İgem Team. Lovely city, lovely team members, lovely presentation!
3. We were spending most of our time in our time in lab for two years. We laughed together all the time during work, we shared day&night together with our best friends; after two years and lots of work hours in lab our instructor was like a mother, our advisor was like a sister to us. Such good memories we’re all going to miss this times.
4. In september we wanted to introduce iGEM competition and share our experience in genetics and lab work to high schoolers! We went to IDF Bilkent High School. Every one of students and especially biology teachers were so interested in iGEM. I guess we just have a new born iGEM High School team from Ankara/Turkey for next year’s competition.
