Prof. Dr. Feride Iffet Şahin
Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine,Baskent University, Ankara, Turkey
Prof. Dr. Feride Iffet Şahin had her M.D. degree from Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. She holds her Ph.D. degree in Medical Biology and Genetics from Gazi University Department of Medical Biology and Genetics. She continued her studies at the Department of Medical Oncology, St.Bartholomew’s Hospital, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London as a visiting scientist. She worked as an assistant professor at the Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Gazi University till 2002. She received her associate professorship degree in 2000. In 2002, she began her work in the Department of Medical Biology and Genetics as the Head of the Department, Başkent University, and in 2004 she became the Head of the Department of Medical Genetics. She held her professorship in 2007. She continues her work as the Head of Department of Medical Genetics.
Her main research interests are hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In particular, her recent projects are focused on determination of molecular mechanisms of genetic and sporadic pathologies by integrating new technologies such as microarray technology. Moreover, she is the principal investigator of many projects of the Institute of Transplantation and Gene Sciences which are mainly focused on agricultural biochemistry and biotechnology, genotoxicological studies in agriculture, and anticarcinogenic, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of extracts of endemic plant species. Her technical background covers many basic and new methodologies in molecular genetics, cytogenetics, and animal cell culture.
She has published over 100 research and review articles in national and international peer-reviewed journals, and wrote 7 book chapters, presented over 120 studies in international and national congresses, and took many awards and scholarships for her studies. Her articles have been cited several times by many reports published in peer-reviewed journals.
