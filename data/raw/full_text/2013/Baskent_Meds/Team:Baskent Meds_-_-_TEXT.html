Check Our Human Practice and Social Section
Like everyone who has to work non-stop we got bored sometimes. Our options were limited but we had so much fun in our “middle of nowhere” lab, had great time with our best friends. Boredom is such a beautiful way to creativity, right?

Greetings Everyone!
We are Team BaskentMeds from Ankara/Turkey. We wanted to share our two years of working time, fun moments, videos, presentations with you in here. It was such beautiful and hard times and we can’t even describe everything we did in here; lots of hours in lab, travelling through universities for meeting other iGEM teams, long e-mail chains for collaboration, video shooting, brainstorming…It’s just… a lot. But we wanted to try to explaine.  We hope you’ll love our project our admire for genetics as much as we do. Can’t wait to meet all of you guys!
