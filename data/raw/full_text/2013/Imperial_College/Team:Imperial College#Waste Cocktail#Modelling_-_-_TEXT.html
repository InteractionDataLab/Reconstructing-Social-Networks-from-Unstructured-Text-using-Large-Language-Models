Polyurethane Degradation
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
The system is controlled by inducible promoters for the gene expression. In our degradation model, we used Hill equation to represent either the repression and induction by the transcription factors on the promoters
Michaelis-Menten kinetics
Enzyme kinetics can be described by 4 ODEs.  However, it is impossible to measure [ES] experimentally and that means the ODEs have to be simplified for modelling.  Michaelis-Menten kinetics assumes quasi-stationary approximation to solve this problem.
Matlab Simbiology
Simbiology is an extension of Matlab that we used to build and simulate our models.  It allows modelling in graphical and programmable environments and uses in-built ODE solvers to simulate the time profile of species levels involved in the model.
