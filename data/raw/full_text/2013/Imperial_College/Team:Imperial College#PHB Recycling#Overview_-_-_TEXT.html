Overview
Polylactic acid (PLA) is for the most part, a chemically derived aliphatic polyester. PLA can be moulded into a product and is used as a feedstock in 3D printing. The bioplastic has high strength and is a thermoplastic. It represents a growing market within the plastic industry, one which will inevitably require degradation at a recycling plant [1] . Currently only tentative pilot studies have been made towards engineering a biological mechanism to enhance degradation. We thus intend to use shredded PLA as a feedstock to breakdown this bioplastic, with enzymes capable of breaking both L- and D- enantiomeric bonds.
