Europe's Newest Mountain, Mount Wasted
Production of the red pigment by stress induction. MG1655 were grown with LB media and sterile filtrated WCM for 48 hours.
Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF)
(A) WCM precursor material, this sterilised media made from LB and SRF was used to produce all WCM utilised. (B) Cells containing mCherry pigment grown in SRF (A) over 3 days, then streaked in a qualitative assay to check for growth. (C) mCherry cells were streaked again after 7 days growth in SRF.
(A) SRF in PBS (phosphate buffered saline), a buffer. We can see from this experiment whether our bacteria can grow solely on the waste SRF. (B) Cells containing mCherry pigment grown in SRF (A) over 3 days, then streaked in a qualitative assay to check for growth. (C) mCherry cells were streaked again after 6 days growth in SRF.
Cultured bacteria performing arts.
