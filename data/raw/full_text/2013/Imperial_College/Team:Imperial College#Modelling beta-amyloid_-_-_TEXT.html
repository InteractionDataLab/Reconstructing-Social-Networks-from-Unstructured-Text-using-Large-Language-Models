Beta-Amyloid Degradation Model
Introduction
This is another degradation model we designed to help UCL 2013 iGEM team with their Beta-Amyloid Degradation Assays . Beta-Amyloid is known as the component of Amyloids Plaque in association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) , in which the target of UCL iGEM this year. Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) was discovered to be able to degrade Beta-Amyloid that can be potentially used to cure Alzheimer's disease. The model provides simulations about how efficient is MMP-9 enzyme to degrade Beta-Amyloids.
Description
Objective
The Mathematical model was built in MATLAB extension Simbiology, it will predict how long will take to degrade a certain concentration of Beta-Amyloid by a given amount of MMP-9 enzyme. The simulation results can help UCL iGEM team to modify their assays in order to achieve better experimental results. The model can also be used to provide a preliminary prediction of degrading Amyloid Plaque in vivo.
Degradation Assays of UCL 2013 iGEM team
The details of the assays are here . There are three different substrates which are soluble aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ),aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils 1-40 and aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils 1-42. Here is the table that defines the initial concentrations of all substrates and the enzyme from the assays.

Explanation
Equations
We choose simple Michalis-Menten mechanism for Beta-Amyloid degradation. The ODEs for all substrate are:
The Km values here are for each substrate correspondingly whereas Kcat values are for MMP-9 in each assay.
Assumption
Although Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) is a well characterised enzyme, there is no clear kinetic data for degrading soluble Beta-Amyloids and its fibrils.
