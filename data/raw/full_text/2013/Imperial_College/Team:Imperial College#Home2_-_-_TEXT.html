Resourceful Waste
Non-recyclable waste is sourced from a recycling          centre, placed in a bioreactor with our M.A.P.L.E          system which degrades the waste and synthesises      the bioplastic P(3HB).
Plastic Fantastic
Plastic Fantastic is a complete P(3HB) bioplastic          recycling platform, where P(3HB) is degraded          into monomeric form and then re-polymerised      back into de novo P(3HB) for future applications.
