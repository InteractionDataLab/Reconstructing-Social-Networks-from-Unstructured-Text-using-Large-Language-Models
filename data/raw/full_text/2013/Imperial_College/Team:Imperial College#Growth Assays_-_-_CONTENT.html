None of the biobricks had significant decreases in their growth rates when induced by the respective inducer - be that Arabinose or Xylose. The remainder of the fluorescence assays did not show a significant difference between induction and no induction. This said, the data still requires normalising, this process might elucidate finally as to whether any other biobricks have significant fluorescence when induced.

To tie it in with our project, we also used M9 minimal waste conditioned media (M9MWCM) to compare growth. Bdh2 is responsible for the synthesis of acetoacetate from 3HB and tagged with sfGFP.

This suggests that bdh2 is able to function as expected and produces acetoacetate which is used by the cell's central metabolic pathways for growth. At 100uM or 100,000 uM, we did not observe any differences in growth. This could be be because the rate limiting step at low concentrations could be the uptake of 3HB rather than it's conversion to acetoacetate. We hope that we can observe an increase in growth if we add the putative permease we designed into the system. At elevated bdh2 concentration, there is a drop in the growth rate in both bdh2 and control cells, probably because of toxicity issues. In addition, fluorescence is highly elevated in bdh2 compared to empty vector control.
