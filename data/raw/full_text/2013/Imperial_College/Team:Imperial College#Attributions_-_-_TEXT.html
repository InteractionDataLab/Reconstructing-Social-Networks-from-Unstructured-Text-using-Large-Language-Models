Alexa Pollmann
Created most of our M.A.P.L.E  context images.
Geoff Baldwin
Thank you for letting us use some of your lab equipment.
Ciaran McKeown
Thank you for helping us purify our proteins.
Lisa Haigh
Thank you for working out the techniques required to run mass spectrometry on our P(3HB) and breakdown monomers. Unfortunately, we ran out of time for this experiment.
Felix Jonas
Thank you for the help with setting up the fluorescent imaging and microscopy tuition.
Tillman Pape
Thank you for helping us with imaging of our cells.
Colin
Thanks you for accommodating us in the teaching lab (or the iGEM lab as we call it!)
Ed Marshall
Thank you for sharing your incredible expertise about the bioplastics industry, during our human practices panel discussion. We used your PLA cup in several of our experiments.
Professor Cheeseman
Thank you for your insight into UK waste management and for an incredibly informative discussion during our human practices panel.
Karen Polizzi
Thank you for contributing to the Human Practices panel discussion. We have really valued your feedback throughout the project.
Simon Little
Our visit to Powerday was one of the highlights of our project, you were a great host and gave us a lot of information about UK recycling. The mixed waste you provided was invaluable to our project!
Doug Simpson
We appreciate the time you gave us to discuss our project from the perspective of the GLA and the Mayor of London's waste management strategy.
