Project description
Waste is an inevitable product of the lives many of us wish to lead. From simple daily routines to essential activities such as agriculture, we produce huge amounts of material which needs somewhere to go or something to be done with.  Our focus is on plastic waste due to its long life in the environment and the toxic byproducts of its degradation which negatively impact upon millions of people’s health and quality of life. It also poses unknown risks for the global ecosystem.  The aim is to produce a biological cycle of plastic degradation and production - complete biological recycling. We are investigating how this will change the way we deal with plastic waste and importantly, the way we think about it.
