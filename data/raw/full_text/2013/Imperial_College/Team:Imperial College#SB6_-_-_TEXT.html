SB6 Helpers
The BioBricks Foundation Synthetic Biology Conference Series (SBx.0 Conference) is the world’s foremost professional meeting in the field of synthetic biology. The BioBricks Foundation is the proud organizer of the conference series and this year Imperial had the honour of hosting the conference. SB6 ran 9th-11th July 2013. We were helpers at the conference, working behind the scenes to help delegates and in collaboration with the event organisers we ensured everything ran smoothly.
We were also lucky enough to see some great talks, and enjoyed networking amongst the synbio community! The buzz of SB6.0 gave us a boost and the inspiration for our iGEM project.
