2013 USTC_CHINA iGEM Chronology
2012
2012
Dec.15th2012
Annual recruiting season We brought a large number of inquisitive minds
to USTC igem team.
2013
Jan.26th2013
Systematic training begin Senior team members gave systematic training to the fresh
and assigned responsibilities for every individual.
Feb.17th2013
Second training course We held a simulated iGEM competition.
Everyone was serious about the task he or she received,
and gained a lot from the simulated competition.
In the end, the team leader was elected by us.
Mar.2nd2013
Grouping and brain storming All the members were divided into several groups
according to their specialty and interest,
and were motivated in the mobilization meeting.
Everyone was ready for the coming activities.
Mar.30th2013
Preliminary identified
several projects Algae produce H2, natural competence
and magnetosome application
were preliminary identified as the promising projects.
May.15th2013
SDI Conference Through detailed discussion, we selected
optimization of blue-green algae produce H2 as our subject.
May.31th2013
Halmatogenesis A recently published paper had already done
what we prepared to do, and we had to start to
search another competitve project.
June.5th2013
In situ transdermal vaccine
born
July.10th-Apr.14th2013
Experiment pet part Introduce plasmid containing the GFP sequence into E.coli
Extract the plasmid after verified by PCR
Connect GFP gene with TD-1 via PCR
Connect the fragment with RBS and locus of restriction
enzyme digestion via PCR
Digest the sequence and the plasmid
with same restriction endonuclease
Connect the sequence and the plasmid with DNA ligase
Verify the recombined plasmid by PCR
Sequence the plasmid
Introduce recombined plasmid into E.coli
Verify the bacterium by PCR
Induce protein expression
Verify the protein by SDS-page
Secret protein abundantly
Concentrate the protein via nickel column
Verify the protein by SDS-page
Transdermal experiments
Apr.15th-Sept.10th2013
Experiment B.subtilis part Get the GFP sequence via PCR
Connect GFP gene with part of TD-1 via PCR
Connect the fragment with another part of TD-1 via PCR
Connect the fragment with promoter and
signal peptide via PCR
Digest the sequence and the plasmid with
same restriction endonuclease
Connect the sequence and the plasmid with DNA ligase
Verify the recombined plasmid by PCR
Sequence the plasmid
Introduce recombined plasmid into B.subtilis
Verify the bacterium by PCR
Induce protein expression
Concentrate the protein via TCA
Verify the protein by SDS-page
