The transformation of Bacillus subtilis
- thaw one aliquot at 37 °C - use these cells to inoculate 20 ml LS medium - shake cells slowly in a 30°C water bath to obtain maximal competence (about 2 h) - take 1 ml aliquots into a glass tube or 2 ml Eppendorf tube, add 10 μl of 0.1 M EGTA (CB-0732-10GAM), and incubate for 5 min at room temperature - add plasmid or chromosomal DNA and incubate for 2 h at 37°C while well shaking (well mixing is important when using Eppendorf cups) - if glass tubes were used, transfer cell suspension into an Eppendorf tube - centrifuge, discard supernatant carefully and resuspend the cells into the final supernatant remaining on the pellet - plate on selective 2xYT medium - incubate at 37°C overnight
