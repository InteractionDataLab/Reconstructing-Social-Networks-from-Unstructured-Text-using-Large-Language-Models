Expression of proteins in Bacillus subtilis
Induction with IPTG - grow appropriate B. subtilis strain overnight in fresh 2xYT medium - inoculate into fresh 2xYT medium to an OD600 of 0.15 - when culture reaches OD600 0.7 – 0.8, split into 2 portions and induce with 1 mM IPTG(CB-0487-1GAM) to one portion (t = 0) - collect samples at different time points for analysis (t = 1,…)
