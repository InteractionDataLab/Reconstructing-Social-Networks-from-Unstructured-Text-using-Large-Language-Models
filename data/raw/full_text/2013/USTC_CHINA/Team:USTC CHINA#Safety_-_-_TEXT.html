Project Safety
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety,public safety or environmental safety?
To ensure biosafety, we design a kill switch in Bacillus for the first time in iGEM. The very type B.subtilis, which contains kill switch circuit, can elimate their siblings and commit suicide when the switch is activated, and thus prevent gene contamination and raise project safty in terms of researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety.
Parts Safety
Do any of the new BioBrick part (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The only safety issue associated with our new BioBrick parts is researcher safety in testing the parts. We've revised a strict Lab operation standard to raise safty.
Safty Supervision
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes.Supervised by biosafety committee,we accepted their advice and abandoned intention to use HBV genome as template to amplify HBsAg antigen. With their help,we obtained plasmid fused HBsAg antigen eventually.
