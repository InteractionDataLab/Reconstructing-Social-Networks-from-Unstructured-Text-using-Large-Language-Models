In Situ Transdermal Vaccine
2013, We Redefined Vaccine
A Revolutionary Transdermal Vaccine
Safe, Reliable, Needle-free and Available for Everyone
Project
Motivation
We hope to develop a fresh-expression transdermal vaccination.
We hope everyone in this world could equally enjoy the benefit of medical progress.
more
Design of Project
With the support of TD-1 , a special polypeptide which can greatly facilitate macromolecule transdermal delivery across intact skin, we constructed three different fuctional engineered Bacillus subtilis; besides, we designed a reporter system, including a kill switch, in the fouth type B.subtilis to improve usability and ensure biosafety.
ANTIGEN
As the core of our in-situ system,
TD1-antigen expresser is designed
and will make up great percentage of
in the total bacteria in our "band-aid".
more
LTB
As one kind of our adjuvant expresser,
TD1-LTB is used to enhance the antigenicity.
For LTB has so many advantages, it's a widely used adjuvant for most of exsiting injected vaccine.
more
TNFα
TNFα is a chemotactic factor recruiting Langerhans Cells, the antigen presenting cells beneath the skin barrier. The TNFα expresser is responsible for collecting LC and triggering more intense immune responses.
more
REPORTER
Reporter notifies users the status of vaccine patch and when to stick.  Furthermore, it contains killing switch as a biosafety guard.

Experimental Measurement
Construction of Vectors
We took E.coli and the pET vector as the positive control and realized our ideas in the
B.subtilis
expression system based on pHT43 shuttle vector.
more
Tests on fusion protein
To achieve fresh expression ultimately, we used purified protein to obtain accurate data and verify our design.
more
Immunogenicity experiments
The most prominent character of 2013USTC iGEM team is that we have not only achieved a series of molecule experiments but also conducted mice experiments, including in vitro transdermal experiments and mice experiments
