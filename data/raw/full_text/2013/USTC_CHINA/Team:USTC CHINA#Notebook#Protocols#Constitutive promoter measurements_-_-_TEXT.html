Constitutive promoter measurements
1. Streak a LB plate of the strain. 2. Inoculate two 3ml cultures of supplemented M9 Medium and antibiotic with single colony from the plate. 3. Cultures were grown in test tubes for 16hrs at 37℃ with shaking at 200rpm. 4. Cultures were diluted 1:100 into 3ml fresh medium and grown for 3hrs. 5. Measure the fluorescence (performed with SpectraMax M5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader，add 200ul liquid in each well) and absorbance (HITACHI UV-VIS spectrophotometer U-2810 ,200ul quartz cell,path length 10mm,600nm,1.5 nm slit width) every 30 minutes in the next 4hrs.
