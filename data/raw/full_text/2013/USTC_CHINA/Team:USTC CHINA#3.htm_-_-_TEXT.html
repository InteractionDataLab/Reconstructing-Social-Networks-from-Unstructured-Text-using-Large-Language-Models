Project Description Based on the fundamental principles and technology of synthetic biology, our   team aims at designing a new immune system containing transdermal peptide that   expresses genes and produces immune responses simultaneously. To reach this   goal, we need to build four kinds of engineered bacteria and find out   effective immune responses. Meanwhile, an appropriate reporting system guiding   vaccination at different stages is also required to meet the demand of   practical, safe and human-friendly production. The Bacillus subtilis we use is   WB800N, which is modified into four types of engineered bacteria, combined   with the gene coding LTB, HBsAg, reporter, and LC Luman-recruiting factor   respectively, each of which contains the gene coding transdermal peptide.   Then, the engineered bacteria will produce mixture of fusion protein in the   skin and activate immune responses.  The introducing of transdermal peptide, together with the simultaneous immune   response with protein expression, has granted our work great advantages over   other existing immune system, both in economy and operation. Therefore it is   expected to become a promising new vaccine research field.  So far, we have successfully synthesize four kinds of plasmids, and the   sequences of them all have been proved correct. Additionally, we have managed   to transform three plasmids from E. coli to Bacillus subtilis, leaving GFP in   progress.  For the coming days, we plan to continue our transformation and experiment on   the mice to check the effects of our vaccine, whereas other tasks, such as   human practice and the standardization of our parts, are in our future   schedule.
