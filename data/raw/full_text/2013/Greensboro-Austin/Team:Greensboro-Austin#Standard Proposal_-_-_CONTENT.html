The archetypical example of such standardization is BioBrick RFC[10], introduced in 2003 by Tom Knight at MIT. BioBricks are stored on a standard plasmid, pSB1C3, which contains prefix and suffix sequences flanking the part. These sequences contain two pairs of 6 bp restriction sites (EcoRI+XbaI and SpeI+PstI), which can be used for both part assembly and quality control. BioBricks are intended to be well-characterized biological parts, such as genes or promoters, that are predictable, ready to use, and can be combined in unique ways. The rules of this assembly method also require that none of these sites are present in the parts themselves. This requirement can be an onerous imposition for iGEM teams using large, novel parts such as genes and operons obtained from environmental samples.
</P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:591px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig. 1: The probability of at least one restriction site appearing in a sequence. The length at which a sequence will have a 50% and 90% likelihood of containing a site are displayed for the 50% GC content line.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Despite the problems with the current standard, it is clear that having a repository of genetic parts stored in a standard plasmid is useful to the field, especially for those with limited resources. Once these constructs are submitted into a database it is very easy for others to incorporate those parts into their own constructs because of the standardized submission; thus making collaboration much simpler.
</P><P>We concluded that the problem with RFC[10] lies in the fact that it requires everyone who wants to submit a part to the database to accommodate a highly restrictive assembly method. In an era when many fast, cheap, and scarless assembly methods are available, mandating a single assembly method no longer benefits the community. It is easily demonstrable that as the size of your construct increases toward the size of an average eukaryotic gene, the chance of one of the four restriction sites popping up in your sequence is rapidly surpasses 50%. We concluded from this analysis that restriction site mutagenesis likely burdens a majority of teams wishing to submit novel parts to the registry.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Survey_Results">Survey Results</SPAN></H2><P>Fixing restriction sites requires both time and money because in order for anyone to utilize your part using the same standard you need to mutate away those unwanted restriction sites in your construct. For iGEM teams who have both limited time and funding, this is a real problem and nonetheless an obstacle for any research group trying to share their work using the Biobrick database. Furthermore, it draws resources away from better characterization of parts - a well-known deficiency of constructs submitted to the registry. Due to these major drawbacks, we speculated that other teams might be having the same issues with regards to part submission and illegal restriction sites. To find out we made a survey asking other teams if they ever come across the same sorts of problems as our team. This survey was distributed through emails to all faculty member emails found for iGEM teams, and through social media to contact student team members. As 9/27/13, we have received responses from 43 teams.

However, some respondents were hesitant or even hostile towards the idea of changing the standard. Some notable responses from individuals at other institutions are shown below.

The financial status of each team is far from equitable, and some kits can be quite expensive.&quot;</I><I><B>Student</B></I></P><P><I>&quot;Taking into account the dropping costs of chemical synthesis of DNA, molecular cloning will not be used for biotechnological purposes in a couple of years. Biobrick-based molecular cloning is obsolete.&quot; </I><I><B>Faculty Instructor</B></I></P><P><I>&quot;The biobrick R10 standard is restrictive and becomes more and more cumbersome if more than 1-2 forbidden restriction sites are present... However, I am concerned that if the standard was not available the registry might not be able to maintain and produce biobricks as easily as it can now.&quot; </I><I><B>Student</B></I></P><P><I>&quot;I agree that current &quot;one pot&quot; assembly methods and DNA synthesis are making the previous standard assembly methods obsolete.  That said, what standard - if any - do you propose as a replacement?  Does the notion of part standardization apply in synthetic biology?  If so, how do you refine the definition?  If not, what are the possible down sides to no longer defining part standards?  I'm all for moving forward, but I'd like to know what I'm moving towards.&quot;</I><I><B>Faculty Instructor</B></I></P><P><I>&quot;About time.

Crucially, <B>this RFC removes the sequence restrictions imposed by RFC10</B> regarding the removal of the restriction enzymes sites EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI from parts before they are eligible for inclusion in the Parts Registry.

While teams <B>SHOULD</B> sequence verify their parts to detect point mutations and small indels, the BioBricks Foundation needs a simple and rapid method for determining that parts are at least the correct size when submitted to The Registry. Currently this quality control is achieved through the use of the restriction sites present in the BioBrick prefix and suffix, resulting in highly restrictive rules for part submission. Therefore, we propose an alternative submission plasmid, <B>pSB1C95</B>, featuring the homing endonucleases I-SceI and I-CeuI and their corresponding restriction enzyme sites for quality control purposes. Parts <B>MUST</B> be submitted between the BioBrick prefix and the BioBrick suffix in  <B>pSB1C95</B>, and the homing endonuclease sites I-SceI and I-CeuI <B>MUST NOT</B> be contained within the part itself, though the probability of this is negligible for gene-sized or even operon-sized parts (Fig. 4). There are no other rules or restrictions for part submission.

The Genbank file for our proposed submission standard may be found here:<A href="/wiki/images/0/09/PSB2C3.gb" class="internal" title="PSB2C3.gb">Media:PSB2C3.gb</A></P><P>
Unlike typical 6 bp restriction sites, these homing endonuclease sites are 18 bp and 
27 bp in length, with a tolerance of sequence degeneracy corresponding to a normal 
restriction site 10 to 12 bp long. However, the probability of even a 10 bp sequence 
randomly occurring in a submitted part is orders of magnitude lower than a 6 bp site, 
thus effectively eliminating the problem of illegal sites for the purposes of rapid quality 
control (Fig. 4).

It is important to employ strategies that enable simple quality control workflows and maximize utility to the end user. We believe that the Open Sequence Format eliminates user problems associated with sequence restrictions while minimally impacting quality control workflows at the repository.
