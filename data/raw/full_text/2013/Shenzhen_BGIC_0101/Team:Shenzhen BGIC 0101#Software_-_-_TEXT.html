It sets us free in the laborious, complex creating procedure, including choosing genes of new system (here the system refers to new pathways which is in form of a chromosome), changing chromosome’s structure, editing coding DNA sequence, splitting the chromosome into equipped fragments for synthesis and assembly.
Genovo’s UI is mainly developed on a genome browser, Jbrowse interface
Functionally, Genovo is partially based on GeneDesign algorithm suite, and BioStudio development environment under SC2.0 project , but it has great extensions.
