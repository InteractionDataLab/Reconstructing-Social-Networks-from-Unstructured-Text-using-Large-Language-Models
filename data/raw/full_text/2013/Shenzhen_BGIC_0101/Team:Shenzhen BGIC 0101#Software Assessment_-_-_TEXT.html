Software Assessment
Comparation Genovo focus on the whole flow of the synthesis of a new yeast chromosome with all the utilities needed. Biostudio and Gendesign turn in the direction of basic synthesis tools. Based on BioStudio and Gendesign, Genovo is more user-friendly and compositive that it has a very clear framework to help design a complete chromosome, loading all the targeted genes. It begins with pathways to grab interested genes to build the whole genome in an interface way and cut genome into pieces to be assembled for experiment. Thus, Synthetic biologist can make it from dry design to wet experiment accomplishment easily with Gennovo. With Biostudio or Gendesign, however, such task is not easy to finish, as you have to think over in details with the only basic tools provided to design, which is much the same like that you use C to process text instead of Perl.
