9 members
– 2 postgraduates and 7 undergraduates – They are all co-culture students between BGI college and their home universities.
Members
Postgraduate
Yuxiang Li
Li is a postgraduate in UCAS, majoring in Bioinformatics.
He is a calm man and likes to speak reasonably.  He concentrates on programming for nucleotide sequence editing and also data transport.
Xinming Liang
Liang is also a postgraduate in UCAS, same with Li. He is responsible man. He loves badminton, orienteering, swimming and also is a HD movie fan. He focuses on programming for chromosome design in this project.
Undergraduate
Jianhui Gong
Gong just graduated from his college SCUT and now works for BGI as a synthetic biology-bioinformatics analyst. He is a crazy SBer and is responsible for chromosome segmentation. BTY, he is team leader.
Xujia Lu
Xujia is from UESTC, shy in the face and gesture, but evil in the heart. He likes novel things and always does something amazing. He is very creative and for most of the time has his own ideas.
Yincheng Li
Li is an undergraduate from SCNU, specializing in Information and Computer Science. He focus on the pathway processing. He enjoys the project and the teamwork.

Support
1. Financial support:
BGI College, it paid team & attendance registration fee, travel allowance and accommodation fee for us.
2. Workplace & desktop & test environment provider:
BGI, Shenzhen, it provided us enough room to discuss, work together, organize meetings and also at least 7 desktops. BGI also allowed us to test our plug-ins and program on mainframe.
3. Server support:
Dr. Huixiong Li from UESTC and Liping Yang from BGI assisted us to establish web-server.
4. Software design guidance:
Mr. Yun Wang assisted us to design the third module SegmMan, assembly from 2k minichunks to 10k chunks, and then to 30k megachunks.
Dr. Patrick Yizhi Cai pointed out some errors of design principle, especially in the homologous recombination from 30k megachunks to whole chromosome.
5. Software based framework provider:
Jbrowse & Gbrowse from GMOD.
GeneDesign & BioStudio from Dr. Sarah Richardson of John Hopkins University.
GASP from Dr. Eroshenko from Harvard School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences
Some nameless frameworks from D3 library and KEGG.
6. Team shirt design support:
Mr. Kang Kang helped us to design two types of shirts, one for team members, one for advertising and sales.
