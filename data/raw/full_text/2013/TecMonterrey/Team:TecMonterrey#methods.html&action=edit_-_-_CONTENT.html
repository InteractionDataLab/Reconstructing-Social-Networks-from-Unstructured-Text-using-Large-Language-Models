After 12 hours of incubation, 250 mL flasks with 50 mL of LB medium with antibiotic were inoculated until 0.1 O.D.600nm (Genesys 10UV scanning, Thermo scientific) with the proper strain.

The supernatant containing the solubilized fraction was recovered.

The strains were transformed with the expression cassettes: </P><H4 class="BioI">Tat-Apoptin</H4><H4 class="BioI">TRAIL</H4><H4 class="BioI">Tat-Apoptin-HlyA</H4><H4 class="BioI">TRAIL-HlyA</H4><P>The transformations were confirmed by selective growth of colonies in plates with Ampicillin (100ug/ml) Furthermore the colonies were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI-HF (NEB) and electrophoresis. </P><H3>Induction, Cell Rupture, Purification, Concentration, Tricine-SDS PAGE and Western Blot</H3><P>The induction, cell rupture, purification, concentration, Tricine-SDS PAGE and Western Blot protocols were performed as specified in the General protocols section with no modifications.</P><H3>CitotoxicityMTT Assay</H3><P>The MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid, is based on the conversion of the reagent MTT into formazan crystals by viable mammal cells, due to the activity of a specific enzyme located in the mitochondrion.  By exploiting this enzymatic activity of dehydrogenase enzymes, the assay can indirectly measure the cell viability of a cell culture through its metabolic activity. This method is one of the most used to measure cytotoxic activity of drugs, extracts and compounds on different cell lines (Meerloo, J. v., Kaspers, G. J., &amp; Cloos, J., 2011).

</P><P>The assay conditions used in the experiment may influence the results and must be considered during the analysis of data. The age of cell lines, the passage number and requisites of the medium may be important factors that can affect the results.  Due to variation on the requirements and growth rates of each cell line, it is difficult to establish specific guidelines for the execution of this experiment; however, cells are usually cultivated at a cell density of 5,000-10,000 cells per well (this density should be enough to reach an optimum density in 48-72 hours).  The presence of phenol red may affect seriously the result, and for this reason it is highly recommended to culture the cells in a phenol red free medium (Vybrant® MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, 2002).</P><P>The assay is divided in different procedures:</P><OL><LI>96 well cell culture plate preparation.</LI><LI>Sample addition to 96 well cell culture plate.</LI><LI>Cell viability measurement.</LI><LI>Data analysis.</LI></OL><OL class="letras"><LI><B>96 well cell culture plate preparation.</B><I>During this first part of the assay, cells are transferred from a culture dish to a 96 well cell culture plate.</I></LI><OL><LI>Exponentially grown cells were trypsinized according to (Trypsinization of adherent cells, 2002).</LI><LI>The cells were suspended in D-MEM/10% SBF medium until it reached a cell density of 5x105 cells/ml.</LI><LI>For each well, 100µl were plated (50,000 cells) on a 96 well microplate according to the layout shown in Appendix 1.</LI><LI>The cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37oC and 5% C02.</LI></OL><LI><B>Sample addition to culture plate.</B><I>After 24 hours of incubation of the cell culture microplate, the sample (extract or isolated compound) to be evaluated is added to the culture plate.</I></LI><OL><LI>Solutions of the samples (TRAIL and Tat-Apoptin) at different concentrations were prepared by diluting in D-MEM/10%SBF medium.

      *The adjustment of the data can be made with different regression models: linear, quadratic, exponential, etc. depending on the data obtained.</LI><LI>With a regression model, the concentration of sample for which it is reached 50% of cell viability (IC50) was obtained. </LI></OL></OL><H2>Secretion System Methods</H2><P>For the secretion module, our team took two different approaches. The first one made use of <I>Escherichia coli</I> BL21 (DE3) co-transformed with a GFP fused to a HlyA secretion peptide in its C terminus and another construct containing the proteins needed for secretion HlyB and HlyD; as a negative control another <I>E. coli</I> BL2 (DE3) was co-transformed with a non-tagged GFP and the same construct containing the proteins needed for secretion HlyB and HlyD in order to measure and compare fluorescence from the contents outside the cell, and those inside (Supernatant and soluble fractions).  For a second approach we co-transformed <EM>E. coli BL21</EM> (DE3) with a construct containing TAT-Apoptin tagged with both a Histidine6x tag and the secretion signal HlyA with another construct containing the proteins needed for secretion HlyB and HlyD; then we con-transformed <I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3) with a construct containing TRAIL tagged with both a Histidine6x tag and the secretion signal HlyA with the same construct containing HlyB and HlyD. Finally we did a Western Blot assay in order to determine and compare presence of TAT-Apoptin-HlyA and TRAIL-HlyA in the supernatant and soluble fractions of the cell cultures.</P><H3>Co-Transformation and Confirmation</H3><P>The <I>E. coli</I> strains (TOP10 or BL21 (DE3)) previously transformed with the construct containing HlyB and HlyD were re-transformed with GFP-HlyA, TAT-Apoptin-HlyA and TRAIL-HlyA, producing the following strains:</P><H4 class="BioI">GFP-HlyA+Secretion System</H4><H4 class="BioI">GFP+Secretion System</H4><H4 class="BioI">TRAIL-HlyA+Secretion System</H4><H4 class="BioI">TAT-Apoptin-HlyA+Secretion System</H4><P>The transformations were confirmed by selective growth of colonies in plates with both Kanamycin (50ug/ml) and Ampicillin (100ug/ml) since the secretion construct contain a Kanamycin resistance gene and the GFP, TRAIL-HlyA and TAT-Apoptin-HlyA containg an ampicillin resistance gene. Furthermore the colonies were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI-HF (NEB) and electrophoresis.</P><H3>Induction</H3><P>50 mL tubes were inoculated with each of the transformed <I>BL21 (DE3)</I> strains and incubated overnight in LB medium with the proper antibiotic (100ug/mL of ampicillin and 50 µg/mL of kanamycinat) 37°C and 250 rpm. After 12 hours of incubation, 250 mL flasks with 50 mL of LB medium and antibiotic were inoculated until 0.1 O.D.600nm (Genesys 10UV scanning, Thermo scientific) with the proper strain. The flasks were then incubated at 37°C and 250 rpm until they reached to an O.D.600nm 1.</P><P>Cells were pelleted (IEC CL40R centrifuge, Thermo scientific) at 4°C and 4,000 g for 10 minutes, the medium was discarded and 50 mL of fresh medium were added and supplemented with the proper antibiotic, 0.1 mM IPTG and 1% L-arabinose.

To achieve this, the carrier Tat peptide and the transported protein (green fluorescent protein, GFP) were associated by genetic construction leading to a fusion protein expressing the PTD at its N-terminus followed by a His-Tag sequence. Taking advantage of the characteristics of the GFP, the protocol described by (Silhol, M. et al, 2002) was followed with some modifications.</P><H3>Transformation and Confirmation</H3><P>The transformation and confirmation protocol were followed as established in the <I>General Protocols</I> section.
