Our university institution was founded in 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen formed a Civil Partnership, nonprofit, called Higher Education and Research, A.C.</P><P>The Tecnológico de Monterrey is a multicampus system with common parameters among which are: the culture of responsibility and attachment to work, integrity and honesty, and innovation and entrepreneurship.  Based on the results of an extensive consultation, our institution defined its new mission in the following terms: &quot;To be persons of integrity, ethical standards and a humanistic vision internationally competitive in their field who are citizens while engaged in the development economic, political, social and cultural life of their community and to the sustainable use of natural resources &quot;.</P><P>During the past years, the institution has turned its attention to biotechnology heavily investing in infrastructure, teaching and laboratory equipment creating the Biotechnology Center.</P><H3>Biotechnology Center</H3><P>The FEMSA Biotechnology Center in the Tecnológico de Monterrey integrates researchers from several academic departments to create interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary groups. Also, it's dedicated to generate research, knowledge transfer and business design models in food and biotechnology areas. The Biotechnology Center emerged 15 years ago as a response to the growing trend in scientific and technological innovation in the country and the whole world.</P><P>To development our research and project, we have been supported by the EBA (the Biotechnology and Food Division), giving us the necessary space to work. At this center, we had access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our workplace in where we performed most of experiments. We also collaborate and form part of a chair for students called i4 belonging to the EBA, the Biotechnology and Food Division.</P><H3>i4 CHAIR</H3><P>We belong to one of the EBA research programs, the i4 Chair for students that is a series of curricular and co-curricular activities that provide the opportunity of augmenting the capabilities of:</P><OL><LI>Imagine.</LI><LI>Investigate.</LI><LI>Innovate.</LI><LI>Incubate.</LI></OL></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
