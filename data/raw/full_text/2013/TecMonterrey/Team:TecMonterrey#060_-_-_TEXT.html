Sergio ángel García Echaudi is a researcher in the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in México, where he is currently working in his Ph.D. His early formation was in the Autonomous University of Baja California, where he obtained his title as a Biologist. He then carried out a thesis on the Isolation and Identification of Psychrophilic Organisms from the Antarctica and Expression of a Superoxide Dismutase from Deschampsia antarctica in Escherichia coli. During the influenza outbreak in 2000, Sergio was part of the team that developed a novel technique for its detection and the creation of a recombinant vaccine against the A/H1N1.

Special Thanks
We would like to thank to the people who helped us during these months in the research process. Teachers, friends and family gave us support during the long and hard days and nights working at the lab. We dedicate a small part of our wiki in comparison of how much they support was useful. Every kind word or small gesture, we treasure at heart. From all Team Tec Monterrey 2013, Thank you!

He supported us by translating the self-examination cancer manual as part of our Human Practices.
ONCOLOGISTS
To validate this project, there have been some experienced oncologists who have validated our research to continue the tests and to know the potential of project for new cancer therapies. During the theoretical research process, we interview many doctors specialized in oncology to ask a review and to discuss about the health implications of our project.

Wiki Design
The WIKI content was edited by Tec de Monterrey iGEM team, however, the programming design and image aspects of the team were in charge of Eduardo Serna (Team member) with the guidance of David Nahúm, our programming instructor.
For the selection of themes, colors and pictures, we had the collaboration of Animation and Digital Design and Communication students who created the overall look of the page. These students were selected through a call to learn and to practice in scientific design. Thank you guys!

Tec de Monterrey
We are the Tec de Monterrey iGEM team from Mexico and we are representing Tecnológico de Monterrey university. Our university institution was founded in 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen formed a Civil Partnership, nonprofit, called Higher Education and Research, A.C.
The Tecnológico de Monterrey is a multicampus system with common parameters among which are: the culture of responsibility and attachment to work, integrity and honesty, and innovation and entrepreneurship.  Based on the results of an extensive consultation, our institution defined its new mission in the following terms: "To be persons of integrity, ethical standards and a humanistic vision internationally competitive in their field who are citizens while engaged in the development economic, political, social and cultural life of their community and to the sustainable use of natural resources ".
During the past years, the institution has turned its attention to biotechnology heavily investing in infrastructure, teaching and laboratory equipment creating the Biotechnology Center.
Biotechnology Center
The FEMSA Biotechnology Center in the Tecnológico de Monterrey integrates researchers from several academic departments to create interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary groups. Also, it's dedicated to generate research, knowledge transfer and business design models in food and biotechnology areas. The Biotechnology Center emerged 15 years ago as a response to the growing trend in scientific and technological innovation in the country and the whole world.
To development our research and project, we have been supported by the EBA (the Biotechnology and Food Division), giving us the necessary space to work. At this center, we had access to the Laboratory of Genetic Manipulation and Molecular Diagnostics, which became our workplace in where we performed most of experiments. We also collaborate and form part of a chair for students called i4 belonging to the EBA, the Biotechnology and Food Division.
i4 CHAIR
We belong to one of the EBA research programs, the i4 Chair for students that is a series of curricular and co-curricular activities that provide the opportunity of augmenting the capabilities of:
Imagine.
Investigate.
Innovate.
Incubate.
