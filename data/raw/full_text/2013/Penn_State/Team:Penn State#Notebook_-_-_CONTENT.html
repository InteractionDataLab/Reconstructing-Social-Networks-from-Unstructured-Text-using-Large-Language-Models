<P style="color: green; "><B>Aug 11-17</B></P><P>Re-isolated cytoskeletal promoter, Actin, from Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Actin was unsuccessful so it was PCR amplified again.

CBAR 1 and CBAR 2 were performed again as described in cas9 notebook. In addition, FiMV promoter was put together again with CBAR. All were successful except the CBAR’s that were rescue PCR amplified. It was determined that the annealing temperatures were not compatible for CBAR 1 and 2 amplification so new primers were ordered. FiMV was successfully PCR amplified and was gel extracted. An intermediate CBAR of CMV35s(2) with mCherry (CBAR 3.5) was conducted and successfully amplified. 
Each component of the construct was CBARed again successfully and a CBAR of those parts was conducted to assemble the entire construct. It was unsuccessful.</P><P style="color: green; "><B>Aug 25-31</B></P><P>More intermediate CBAR’s were conducted to piece together CBAR 1 with CBAR 2 from above, named CA.

Went into the troubleshooting phase</P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 16-29</B></P><P>After consulting with graduate students and advisors we tried to PCR amplify the CesA ! promoter using different annealing temperatures, concentrations, polymerases, and elongation times.

Moved into PCR amplification of CesA 4, CesA 7, and CesA 8 from the genomic DNA. Just as with the promoter, we encountered many problems and did not have a successful band with genomic DNA. cDNA had been ordered and arrived at the end of the week.</P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 14-20</B></P><P>After cDNA arrived, we attempted to PCR amplify CesA 7 and CesA 8 as CesA 4 was backordered. It was successful after many failed attempts. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 21-27</B></P><P>The successful bands were PCR amplified and we achieved high enough yields to proceed. Although, the construct could not be complete so cDNA was then ordered from Japan. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 28- Aug 3</B></P><P>Since the cDNA from Japan did not arrive, we redesigned the construct without it and had to wait for primers to come in. CesA 7 and CesA 8 were then sent for sequencing.</P><P style="color: green; "><B>Aug 4-10</B></P><P>Tried multiple times to isolate CesA 4 from a cDNA library, but we were unsuccessful.</P><P>**After meeting with our advisors, we decided to put this project on hold and focus our efforts on the promoter project**</P><H1 id="But" style="color: green"> Butanol Project</H1><P style="color: green; "><B>April 21-28</B></P><P>A rough draft of Castor and Pollux were designed using a 2A sequence to separate the different genes in the pathway. The amino acid sequences for the genes were tracked down and converted back into optimized nucleic acid sequences for Nicotiana and Physcomitrella. Sequences for the CMV promoter and NOS terminator were also found and added to the sequences.</P><P style="color: green; "><B>May 12-18</B></P><P>More research was done into the 2A sequence, and we are more confident that we can chain together the different proteins for Castor and Pollux. This also raised concerns that the 2A sequence would leave “scars” on the the upstream and downstream coding sequences. This was addressed by searching for the structures of the proteins in Castor and Pollux and placing the 2A sequence at the least obstructed end of the protein. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>May 19-25</B></P><P>Other pathways that utilized NADH were found that could synthesize butanol, but the team decided to stay with a NADPH dependent pathway. It was also suggested by our advisors that we could divert one of the intermediates in the butanol synthesis pathway for making a plastic as a secondary product. The proteins in the butanol synthesis pathway were checked again to make sure that the 2A sequence would interfere as little as possible with protein folding. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for stop codons and edited to remove restriction sites that could be problematic in the future. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>May 26-June 1</B></P><P>An enzyme that could catalyze the synthesis of the plastic, polyhydroxybutyrate, was tracked down. This enzyme will be in its own construct to allow for co-transformation to make either plastic or butanol. The drafts of the constructs were also checked for errors and corrected. They were also optimized for assembly. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 2-8</B></P><P>The three constructs – PhaC, Castor, and Pollux –were run through final checks.  Vector plasmids were also cultured. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 9-15</B></P><P>DNA was ordered for the synthesis of PhaC and Castor. Various issues were addressed concerning problems with synthesis. As a result the NOS terminator would have to be amplified from a source, and could not be synthesized. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 16-22</B></P><P>The NOS terminators were amplified in preparation for assembly of PhaC and Castor. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 23-29</B></P><P>The DNA arrived, was hydrated, and a preliminary CBAR reaction was completed to assemble the two constructs. The desired product was then PCR amplified from the CBAR reaction. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>June 30-July 6</B></P><P>A gel of the PCR amplified CBAR did not yield either of the constructs. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 7-13</B></P><P>The PCR amplification of both CBAR were again run on a gel, but again yielded nothing. The CBAR were run again, but were heat killed this time. This did not solve the problem and the CBAR were still unsuccessful. Two new vector plasmids were also cultured. A gradient PCR was also tried for PhaC. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 14-20</B></P><P>Pollux was optimized for synthesis. This required breaking it into two major segments that would later need to be assembled. It was also suggested that PhaC and Castor be assembled with intermediates instead of all at once. New primers were designed to implement this idea. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 21-27</B></P><P>Intermediate components of PhaC and Castor were prepared via PCR. These were then run through a CBAR to assemble them into their final constructs. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>July 28-August 3</B></P><P>PhaC was digested and ligated into its final construct, minus the NOS terminator. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>August 4-10</B></P><P>The PhaC construct was transformed and colonies were picked for a screen.</P><P style="color: green; "><B>August 11-17</B></P><P>The screen of PhaC looked promising. Castor was digested and ligated into its final vector plasmid. Colonies were picked and cultured for a screen. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>August 18-24</B></P><P>PhaC was sequenced and found to be correct. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>August 25-31</B></P><P>The PhaC construct was digested and the NOS terminator prepared previously was ligated. The screen colonies for Castor were digested and run on a gel. The results looked promising for Castor being in the desired construct. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>September 1-7</B></P><P>Castor was submitted to sequencing and found to be correct. However one of the sequencing reactions went poorly and will need to be re-run. Primers were also designed for amplifying parts to be submitted to the registry. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>September 8-14</B></P><P>The failed sequencing reaction for Castor was repeated and confirmed the sequence. Parts were also amplified and prepared to be submitted to the registry. The PhaC and Castor constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>September 15-21</B></P><P>The parts to be submitted were prepared and sent to the registry. PhaC and Castor were also transiently transformed into Nicotiana tabacum. </P><P style="color: green; "><B>September 22-28</B></P><P>The sections of the transformed Nicotiana leaves were cut and stained. These were viewed with fluorescence microscopy for the presence of the plastic polyhydroxybutyrate. Due to issues with staining, the results were inconclusive. </P><H1 id="Van" style="color: green"> Vanillin Project</H1><P style="color: green; "><B>May 27-31</B></P>
