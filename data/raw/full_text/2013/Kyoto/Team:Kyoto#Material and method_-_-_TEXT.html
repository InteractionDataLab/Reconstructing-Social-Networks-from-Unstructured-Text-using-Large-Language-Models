Wrap the top of the beaker with plastic wrap.
Punch a hole through the wrap with a pipette tip (To let out steam).

Allow the agarose to cool.
Pour the agarose solution into a gel tray on a gel maker.

Gel Extraction and PCR Purification
Use Promega Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System.
Gel Extraction
Perform electrophoresis using an established protocol.
Weigh a 1.5 mlL microcentrifuge tube for each DNA fragment to be isolated and record the weight.
Visualize and photograph the DNA using a long-wavelength UV lamp and an intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide. To reduce nicking, irradiate the gel for the absolute minimum time possible. Excise the DNA fragment of interest in a minimal volume of agarose using a clean scalpel or razor blade.
Transfer the gel slice to the weighed microcentrifuge tube and record the weight. Subtract the weight of the empty tube from the total weight to obtain the weight of the gel slice.
Add Membrane Binding Solution at a ratio of 10 µL of solution per 10 mg of agarose gel slice.
Vortex the mixture and incubate at 52 °C for 10 minutes or until the gel slice is completely dissolved. Vortex the tube every few minutes to increase the rate of agarose gel melting. Centrifuge the tube briefly at room temperature to ensure the contents are at the bottom of the tube. Once the agarose gel is melted, the gel will not resolidify at room temperature.
Proceed to General.
PCR Purification
Amplify target of choice using standard amplification conditions.
Add an equal volume of Membrane Binding Solution to the PCR amplification.
Proceed to General.
General
Place one SV Minicolumn in a Collection Tube for each dissolved gel slice or PCR amplification.
Transfer the dissolved gel mixture or prepared PCR product to the SV Minicolumn assembly and incubate for 1 minute at room temperature.
Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 g for 1 min. Remove the SV Minicolumn from the Spin Column assembly and discard the liquid in the Collection Tube. Return the SV Minicolumn to the Collection Tube.
Wash the column by adding 700 µL of Membrane Wash Solution, previously diluted with 95% ethanol, to the SV Minicolumn. Centrifuge the SV Minicolumn assembly for 1 min at 16,000 g.
Remove the SV Minicolumn assembly from the centrifuge, being careful not to wet the bottom of the column with the flowthrough. Empty the Collection Tube and recentrifuge the column assembly for 1 min with the microcentrifuge lid open (or off) to allow evaporation of any residual ethanol.
Carefully transfer the SV Minicolumn to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Apply 30 mL of MilliQ directly to the center of the column without touching the membrane with with the pipette tip. Incubate at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuge for 1 min at 16,000 g.
Discard the SV Minicolumn and store the microcentrifuge tube containing the eluted DNA at 4 °C or 20 °C
