3. List and describe all new or modified coding regions you will be using in your project. (If you use parts from the 2013 iGEM Distribution without modifying them, you do not need to list those parts.)
Part number.
Where did you get the physical DNA for this part (which lab, synthesis company, etc)
What species does this part originally come from?
What is the Risk Group of the species?
What is the function of this part, in its parent species?

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
Nothing.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
No.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
We were taught rules about safety by our advisers and senior students who participated in past iGEM competitions. For example, how we must dispose of waste liquid culture, biohazard level and other basic knowledge.
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines
http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ja/research/ethic/dna/index.htm/ This page is written in Japanese. If any problems occur, please make contact with us.
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
Yes. Although we have not discussed with them, our project proposal was submitted to the Committee and it was approved.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
Yes. http://www.bch.biodic.go.jp/english/cartagena/images/e_cartagena.pdf
d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? (Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features [see 2013.igem.org/Safety for help].
The BioSafety Level of our lab is 1.
e. What is the Risk Group of your chassis organism(s), as you stated in question 1? If it does not match the BSL rating of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are taking.
The Risk Group is 1. This matches the BSL of our lab.
