From this survey, we concluded that it is important to enrich the people's knowledge on biotechnology when we want public people to accept biotechnology more.

And, we investigated how these elements influence the answers of this questionnaire about gene modification. We conducted this survey to Japanese and non-japanese people. The countries where we conducted the questionnaire is listed below.

Chi-square test: To test statistically the difference between the expected frequency with the measured frequency.If calculated probability (p-value) is less than 0.05, significance is confirmed statistically.

		2	no check
Q2.1 Subjects are killed in the experiment, but it can save people in disease. 
Q2.2 Subjects can be killed in the experiment, but it can save people in disease.
Q2.3 Subjects are not killed in the experiment but they never go back in nature. However, it can save people in disease.
Q2.4 Subjects are only observed in nature and it can save people in disease. 
Q2.5 Subjects are killed in the experiment, but it can improve our life.
Q2.6 Subjects can be killed in the experiment, but it can improve our life.
Q2.7 Subjects are not killed in the experiment but they never go back in nature. However, it can improve our life.
Q2.8 Subjects are only observed in nature and it can improve our life.
Q2.9 Subjects are killed in the experiment, but it can advance science.
Q2.10 Subjects can be killed in the experiment, but it can advance science.
Q2.11 Subjects are not killed in the experiment but they never go back in nature. However, it can advance science.
Q2.12 Subjects are only observed in nature and it can advance science.
Q3 How much do you know about genetically modifying (GM) technology?
		1	 I know well.
		2	I know only its name.
		3	I do not know at all.
Q4 Do you think modifying creature’s gene is ethically permissible or not?			
		1	Yes, we can modify every creatures’ gene.
		2	 Partly yes, some can be but others are not.
		3	No, any living things’ gene cannot be modified.
Q5 Who answered ‘partly yes’ to the fifth question, please answer this question. Which of these creatures’ gene can be modified? Please give X as many as you think it is permissible.

We checked the correlation between whether people have specific religion and their answers to Q4.
There is no significant difference between whether people have specific religion and the answer “YES/ Partly YES”. 
There is a significant difference between whether people have specific religion and the answer “NO”. 
In conclusion, it seems that whether having specific religion can influence whether GM is ethically permissible or not.</P><P><A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Humanpractice/Data" class="external text" rel="nofollow">（All the results of the questionnaire）</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/67/Kyoto_questionnaire_raw.xls" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Download raw data(xls)</A></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</SPAN></H2><P>In the result of the questionnaire we conducted in 2013, we can see the influence of religion. To the contrary, the effect of knowledge level is not observed. However, in the questionnaire in 2010, people’s attitude varied according to knowledge level. In this time, since our aim is to shed light on effect except for knowledge, we made fewer question to measure knowledge level. This is why a knowledge level made next to no difference to this survey. Learning from the result of the two survey, because we should not interfere with others’ religion, we have to give them knowledge about synthetic biology considering what each individual believe in.

Moreover, this difference may have generated not only from religion but also from the difference between region and culture. We would like to conduct surveys on factors such as region, culture, economic development, and so on, in order to find out which factor influence the tolerance.

As one of the programs, we held a seminar in Toyonaka high school at (2013/1/12-13). In this seminar, we lectured molecular biology and experiments to the students.
Through this activity, students seemed to feel a familiarity with life science and we were able to give essential knowledge.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Poster_session_at_the_school_festival">Poster session at the school festival</SPAN></H3><P>Our University has a school festival called NF every year. This is one of the biggest events in our university and many people from all around Japan visit it. This year, iGEM Kyoto presented our project to these visitors by poster session, and this was actually broadcasted by a popular Japanese TV news program (Mezamashi TV). Through this TV program, we were able to spread our activity to the general public, and succeeded in increasing general knowledge towards biotechnology and life science.

Through presenting our project, we helped people understand life science. Additionally, we received the &quot;Einstein&quot; prize.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Join_.22START.22">Join &quot;START&quot;</SPAN></H3><P>iGEM Kyoto joined “START”, a party held in April and welcomed new students to make iGEM’s activities more common. START is a union which consists of 25 students’ organizations, and those 25 organizations encourage students to contribute to global society. For example, help students who want to study abroad, practice English to work in global society, and communicate with foreign universities.
</P><P>Additionally, most of these organizations perform international scene or positively contribute to the society. Therefore, some famous companies or volunteer organizations visited this party. We advertised iGEM and succeeded in making synthetic biology more popular.
