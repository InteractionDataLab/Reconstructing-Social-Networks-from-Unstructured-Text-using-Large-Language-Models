Mini Preps of liquid cultures pRS416 and Blue construct followed by an agarose gel of the Mini Prep samples. Digested pRS416 and the Blue construct with EcoR1 and Spe. Ran an agarose gel of digested DNA. Performed DNA extraction of pRS416 and the Blue construct from agarose gel. 
Members: BAT

07-10-13
Used Mini Prep kit to concentration DNA from extraction. Ran an agarose gel to see if the DNA extraction was successful. Unsuccessful extraction was decided. New liquid cultures of LB AMP were inoculated with pRS416 and the Blue construct. 
Members: BT

07-11-13
Mini preps were performed on the new liquid cultures. Ran an agarose gel of the Mini Preps. Digested pRS416 and the Blue construct with Spe. for 1 hour then digested the same sample with EcoR1 for 3 hours. BSA was added to the digestion along with the enzyme and cut smart buffer. Ran an agarose gel of digested DNA. Began DNA extraction of pRS416 and the Blue construct from gel by running the DNA from the gel onto the membrane and storing the membranes in high salt buffer in the 4°C fridge. Received Yeast cell strain and plated on YPD. 
Members: BT

07-12-13
Extracted DNA from membrane and completed protocol for the extraction of DNA from a gel from yesterday’s sample. Performed ligation and transformation of digested pRS416 and the Blue construct. Ran an agarose gel for samples of before and after the ligated DNA. The gel showed a failed ligation. Two ligations were set up: one using Dr. Anthony’s ligase and the other using Dr. Brandt’s ligase. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="main" id="julyw3"><DIV class="details"><DIV class="title">July</DIV><DIV class="shortDescription">Week 3</DIV></DIV><DIV class="bottomPart">
07-15-13
Performed ligation and transformation using the same DNA from extraction on 7-11-13 and 7-12-13. Ran a gel of the before and after ligations from the day. Only the before ligation DNA for Dr. A’s sample could be observed on the gel. It appeared to be pRS416 digested DNA only in the sample. Received E.coli cell strain and plated it on LB agar. Made new LB agar plates. Inoculated YPD culture with yeast cell strain colony from YPD agar plated 7-11-13. 
Members: BT

07-16-13
No transformants observed from yesterday’s ligation. Performed ligation on previously cut samples of pRS416 and the Blue construct from 7-11-13. The ligation was incubated at 16°C overnight instead of at room temperature for 1 hour as previously done. Created stock yeast cells: .750mL of 30% glycerol and .750mL of yeast YPD culture. The <I><I>E. coli</I></I> cells plated yesterday grew on LB plate. These cells were then used to inoculate liquid LB culture. 
Members: BT

07-17-13
Ran an agarose gel of before and after ligation samples to observe the success of the ligation from 7-16-13. Transformed ligated DNA. Started again from uncut fragment DNA of pRS416 and the Blue construct with individual digests this time not using BSA. Digested with Spe for 1 hour then EcoR1 for 3 hours.

No Transformants observed from 7-17-13 transformation. Ran a gel of yesterday’s digestion and extraction the DNA from the gel.  
Members: BT

07-19-13
Ran a gel to confirm the DNA extraction was successful. From this gel the relative concentration of 1μL of the extracted DNA of pRS416 and the Blue construct was determined. From this concentration the amount of DNA needed for the ligation of pRS416 and the Blue construct was determined. A ligation was set up. 1μL of DNA for before ligation sample was obtained for the gel. The before ligation sample and the ligation sample were allowed to incubate at 16°C overnight. 
Members: BT

07-20-13
1μL for after ligation sample was obtained for gel. Transformed ligated DNA onto LB AMP plates. Ran a gel showing the before and after ligation. The gel shows a somewhat successful ligation.

No colonies were seen from 7-20-13 transformation. Transformation sample from 7-20-13 was spun down and resuspended in 200μL of LB liquid. This was plated on 2 LB plates. Four transformations of ligation mix using 5μL instead of 1μL of sample from 7-19-13 were performed. 
Members: BT

07-23-13
No colonies were seen. The transformation sample from 7-22-13 was spun down and the cells were resuspended in 200μL. 100μL of three of these samples were plated on 6 LB AMP plates and 200μL of one these samples was plated on one plate. The plates were allowed to grow overnight at 37°C.
