Lab Notes: June
Date
Notes
June 1
Gel electrophoresis and pick up several colonies. Small-scale plasmid purification and then cut with E+P.
June 2
Gel electrophoresis to analyze restriction fragments. Transformations of several parts (BBa_K6008002, BBa_K411003, 23L, 17F, GFP).
June 3
Pick up three colonies of part 17F and cultivate in LB+A medium. Transformations of 23L and 5-1D R0010 for another time.
June 4
Pick up colonies of 23L terminator --- successful! Transformations of 17F, GFP, and plasmids mentioned on June 1st.
June 5
Find monoclone of BBa_K6008002 (cultured in June 2nd). Transformation of part DH10. Pick up colonies of 5-1D R0010.
June 6
Small-scale plasmid purification of 17F part. Sterilization of culture plates and cuvettes.
June 7
Plasmid purification of 23L part. Store strains in -80°C.
June 8
Transformations of parts R0010, GFP and BBa_K411003. Pick up colonies of R0010 and GFP.
June 9
Small-scale plasmid purification of GFP.
June 10
June 11
Preliminary experiment using new competent cell of DH52, and BL21.
June 12
Pick up colonies of GFP and R0010 and cultivate in LB+A medium.
June 13-30
Final examinations for the semester.
