Dr. Yuhua Hu's visit
Dr. Yuhua Hu, the technology manager of School of Biology Sciences, University of Edinburgh, visited our team on April ninth. We briefly introduced our lab and team construction to her, and she described how Edinburgh team built and their current condition. Then we talked about the development and future between two teams, and hope to find a new way to do human practice. We are all looking forward to the future collaboration of iGEM teams and students associations between Zhejiang University and University of Edinburgh!
Introduced our lab and team construction to Dr Yuhua Hu.
