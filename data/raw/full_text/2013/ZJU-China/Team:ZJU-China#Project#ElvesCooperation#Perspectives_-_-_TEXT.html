The "Elf"
Background Design Results Perspetives
The "Elf": Perspectives
Holin and its counterpart, antiholin (in this case, lrgA and lrgB) have already been cloned and purified. In the future, we plan to insert holin at the downstream part of Plasmid 4. In Plasmid 3, lrgB with a consecutive promoter is assumed to be plugged in.
After a well-designed screening for atrazine aptamers, an atrazine-sensitive riboswitch is assembled with which the bacteria are able to sense atrazine degradation.
