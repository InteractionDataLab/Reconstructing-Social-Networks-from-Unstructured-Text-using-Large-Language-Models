with lots of accidents. Now, the most pressing issue Summer had to deal with was how to determine the ingredients of the yellow powder. Secondly, for the convenience of future work, she must make some things which would help to detect the unknown. She was most knowledgeable in the realm of biology. Naturally, she turned to it to find a solution. From recent research, she noticed something called aptamer. Her intuition convinced her that it would be a powerful substance. However, up to now there was no method to make use of this tiny thing. It was able to combine with many substances specially. Well, Specific combination! Yeah, that was the case! Summer succeeded to find the solution. The following thing she needed to do was to come up with the applications in details. Meanwhile, an apparent phenomenon was that the size of substances was variable thus questions arose. Take Atrazine molecules as an example, if something is too small, accurately detecting it will be considerably challenging. While things are too big such as complex proteins, aptamer will fail to sustain them considering its own size. If this was the case, what to do? Well, just let it be. Take a good first step is better, which meant finishing the small molecules examination first. At the same time, removed the Atrazine from the yellow powder.
</P><P>“I am implanting some parts into your bodies and I am going to tell you how to operate them later.” Summer was always in such a brief every time she faced something serious. It was her style.
</P><P>With her words coming to an end, the two guys lay down right away relaxing until she finished the work to install all the parts. In addition, she cloned the connection mediums of those parts then put them into the bacteria. As a result, two bacteria groups were formed. One was led by Lily，after the first part of job accomplished, their heads were painted a red mark. And the other was led by Wind, with a green mark on their heads, their jobs were to finish the work left behind. Well, all things had been worked out. But why the little prince had yet not brought the picnic lunch yet? 
</P><P>“Little Dot, Mr Careless, little prince……”
</P><P>“I am coming!”
</P><P>“Aha, nice, I am really hungry!”
</P><P>After a quick meal, Summer said:“Wind and Lily went out to work. There are something left behind I need to deal with. So I go inside in advance.”
</P><P>“I would like to enter your laboratory, could I?”
</P><P>“I will go too.” Mr Careless was not quiet anymore.
</P><P>“Hey, Mr Careless, do you still remember the bottle of perfume you knocked over last time? It took me over one month to blend!”
</P><P>“Well, I did not mean it.” Mr Careless said in a timid manner.
</P><P>“All right.” All of them were happy. One was because he had never been to a laboratory and held the view that there must be lots of novel things. The other two recognized completely that lots of things in Summer’s lab were funny. For example, the pen which can write invisible characters. The characters can only be recognized after met specific kind of liquid.
</P><P>Summer devoted herself to research after she entered the lab and gave little attention to things around. Now she was busy with detection and decomposition of micromolecules and not clear what to do. When she was observing the cells under the microscope, Mr Careless ran to the mirror below for the purpose of scaring her. However, there was a damn cell ahead and it occupied a definitely excellent position. With a pair of sharp pliers which was installed after he begged Summer for a long time and could be regarded as the first in the universe, he poked the cell wall unconsciously. Immediately, a hole showed up in the cell wall. If a little further into it, Mr Careless even could enter the bacteria body himself to see the inner structures clearly. What he could do now was just to wait quietly under the microscope and hopefully would receive the blame from Summer. After all, he made a mistake. Time passed by, he did not hear the roar of Summer, so he raised his head and had a look upon to the microscope.
</P><P>“Hey, Mr Careless, what are you doing?”
</P><P>“I, Um...I was wrong.”
</P><P>“You did not do anything wrong.”
</P><P>“How comes?” Mr Careless was confused with his eyes opening widely.
</P><P>“Go into the body of the colon bacillus and help me install these parts.”
</P><P>“Um, what?” Mr Careless did not fully understand. Actually, I did not figure it out too.
</P><P>“Get all these things installed according to the drawing I offer you. I need a new weapon!” Summer pretended to be in complacency. 
</P><P>“Well, OK.” Mr careless had thought the inner part of cell wall should have lots of nice artwork. How it comes? It was just an empty shell with nothing! That really was a big disappointment. However, work was work and should be separated. 
</P><P>“I've finished it.”
</P><P>“Come out, you need to do more to complete it.”
</P><P>Looking at the bacteria remains, Mr Careless was overwhelmed. How long it would take to deal with all the bacteria? He curled his lips in discontent. “Summer, what is the use of this new weapon? How it will be so much? Will mechanical arms be helpful?”
</P><P>“Mr Careless, you know what, only you can accomplish this tough task. You know, if we make out the new weapon, the disaster will be eliminated. You won’t believe what a significant contribution you will make!”
</P><P>“Really?”His eyes flashed lights when he was hearing this. Up to now, he always made mistakes and got critics. Thus, he was looked down by the little guys. But this time, I was afraid that they would look upon me respectively. Gradually, he got lost in his thought.
</P><P>“Hey, Mr Careless, wake up!”
</P><P>“Oh, work...”
</P><P>Wind and Lily finally accomplished their mission, after fighting a whole day. Back to the safe house, Summer set the parts of the rest germs in order. She hoped all the plants came to life, for she loved this lovely little life, loved her home and her planet. She promised to herself to protect her treasures. And she made it. The planet had been at peace, with any wars for several years. And you can see, the planet came back to life, the warm sunshine, the sunflower with a big smile, etc.
</P><P>Two days later, Mr Careless finished his task. 
</P><P>“Thanks, you’ve had a long day.” Summer said to Mr Careless in a sweet voice, which sent shivers to Mr Careless. 
</P><P>“Pardon, any problem?” Mr Careless replied vigilantly, knowing that there was something wrong.
</P><P>“In fact, I just wanna to inform you that Wind and Lily have set all the problems down.” 
</P><P>“So, all my hard work is in vain, what I have done is totally of no significance.” Said Mr Careless unhappily. “Oh, no. Not exactly. We just look up a book, in which mentions a way to test illness. And I think this work is significant. Don’t you have confidence in us?”  
</P><P>Mr Careless compromised, “if so, I have been a big help.” 
</P><P>“of course, you’ve helped us a lot. Without you, we can’t finished all this work.”
</P><P>“I know, I am just a free coolie.” Mr Careless mumbled.
</P><P>“Maybe we can try to make it a famous product and then sell it to others to get some money. With the money, we can buy some material to maintain the operation of the planet. Don’t you think it’s a wonderful idea.”
</P><P>“Oh, not too bad.” Mr Careless answered.
</P><P>
“We can call the product ghost. It can test the thrombin in the blood sample, then judge whether the person is infected with W illness quickly. Oh , I make it. It’s really a miracle. My invention can not only test and clear small molecules, but also macro molecule matter.” Summer mumbled in a high voice on purpose so that Mr Careless could hear. She knew that though Mr Careless sometimes was reckless, he sparked her inspiration. Without him, she couldn’t have solved all the problems. But Mr Careless didn’t realize his importance. Summer hoped Mr Careless would always be happy.
