This is a transparent house!” Except the glass cover, he had never seen a building built up with glass. He didn’t know how it was made, but just realized that this structure should be the first in the universe.
</P><P>“Haha, here we are. Come in.”
</P><P>Summer put Little Dot on her bed which looked like an exquisite baby’s cot. In no time, Little Dot slept soundly.
</P><P>“This room is for you. Have a nice sleep.” Summer showed a Japanese style room, which located on the second floor, to the little prince. 
</P><P>The little prince lay on his bed, looked into the sky, and found a bright star where he thought lived his rose. Gradually, he slept peacefully.
</P><P>“Everybody, get up!” Summer yelled loudly and excitedly. That was a normal morning on planet Ecoli. Once hearing the sound, the little prince woke up immediately. He rubbed his eyes. The second he looked outside, he felt freshness and vitality. In the dawn, a rainbow suspended on the sky, the dew on the flowers and grass sparkled in the sunshine, the planet woke up. The little prince couldn’t help but wonder.
</P><P>“Get up so early. You must have a good rest last night, right? Let me show you around my planet today, OK? Believe me, the scenery here is wonderful and special!”
</P><P>“Uh, fine. You look different today, you know.” This was all because Summer dressed her clothes of flame angel. It was a bit dreamlike.
</P><P>“Yeah, you figure it out. I have a nickname, Flame Angel.” Summer began to pose as if she could play magic. We had to admit that her inventions were good use until now. But whether she could save the universe, that remained to be seen.
</P><P>The little prince was also a bit exciting, influenced by Summer.
</P><P>At that time, Little Dot, Mr Careless, Lily and Wind flied to them. They were all installed with wings, which Summer made yesterday. They already prepared well for outside. With the engine firefly starting, minutes later they got to the Garden of Eden. The whole farm presented a state of radiation. In the middle of it grew an old tree, who may have one hundred years old. Each quadrant area planted with different plants. The little prince standing in a sea of flowers, against the wind, closing his eyes and breathing the fragrance, was really very carefree. At noon, they climbed to the big tree and enjoyed a delicious lunch. Summer had her own theory about meals. 
</P><P>“Do you know why I just have one meal a day? There are lots of reasons that can back up my theory. First, the key point about meals is to get energy. Second, preparing three meals a day is a waste of time. Third, eating too much does no good but gaining weight. ”
</P><P>The little prince listened sincerely. Maybe there were many benefits in Summer’s theory, we human still have our three meals a day. You choose it, because it is pleasure for you at that moment. Otherwise, you’ll get to the opposite. Anyway, they have a world which belongs to them.
</P><P>When they were ready to fly home, a wind blew, bringing a rain of yellow powder.
</P><P>“Summer, look!” Mr Careless cried.
</P><P>Summer knitted her brows. She had never met a scene like this. Subconsciously, she felt worried. Without a word, she went out of the firefly and collected some powders by a handkerchief. When they arrived home, Summer went to her lab alone. The four small lives behaved in their old manners. There left the little prince alone. He walked to his bedroom quietly. This was a busy and happy day. It had been a long time before he found someone he liked. We are all alone, but once we have our lovers we change. Love, friendship, and kinship teach people to live. Faced with the setting sun, leaning against the glass, the little prince recalled the lively day he spent with the five guys. “If only she was as happy as the flowers I saw today.” The little prince said to himself. Beauty exists in the world all the time. With a smile on his face, the little prince got to sleep. That night he had a dream in which he danced with his rose. The charming dance, the melodious accompaniment, the romantic atmosphere, everything seemed just perfect. He must have had a good sleep.
