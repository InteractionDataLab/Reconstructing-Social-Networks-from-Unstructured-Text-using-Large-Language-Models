Introduction
Welcome to team ZJU-China, a group of enthusiastic people from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China! While enjoying the fascinating sights of view in Hangzhou, we are seeking new paths towards better life by synthesis of biological parts.
The previous ZJU-China designed the following fantastic devices during recent years: Bach the gene composer (2010), Rainbofilm with heptachromia (2011), and RNA Scaffold in love story (2012). In 2013, we focus on aptamers. We observe, understand, and utilize these tiny oligonucleotides in order to build a smart bio-device by which certain compounds are detected, degraded and characterized.
We name our project “A Tale of Aptamers: Ghost & Elf”. By distinction, Aptamers will act as a “ghost sensor” as well as an “elfish destroyer” under our conception and construction. Specific substances are able to be sensed and reported in a quick manner by virtue of our engineered cells. With the aid of quorum sensing, different reprogrammed bacteria collaborate to degrade toxic compounds. We also provide a characterization process in order to help people around the world gain deep insight into aptamers.
In addition to our projects, a fairy tale and a chess game are designed as an advance of human practice for synthetic biology. We really look forward to your pleasure in reading our story and playing our game.
