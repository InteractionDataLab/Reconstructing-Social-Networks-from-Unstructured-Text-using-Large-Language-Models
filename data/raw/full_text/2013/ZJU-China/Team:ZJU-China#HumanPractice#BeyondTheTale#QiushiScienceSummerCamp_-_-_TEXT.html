Qiushi Science Summer Camp
From Aug. 6th to Aug. 10, Qiushi Summer Camp for Biology Science was held in College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University in which 72 high school students from all around China participated. During that time, members of ZJU-China iGEM team played a special role. Three members illustrated the experiment methods and skills of molecular biology when these students visited Room 413 of Biology Experiment Center, the home of ZJU-China iGEM. Younger students showed amazing interest in genes and the experiment instruments daily used by iGEMers.
Later, two of our team member, Zukai Liu and Yujie Chen gave an interesting presentation to all the students and teachers involved in the summer camp with the topic “A glance at iGEM” in a meeting room. ZJU-iGEMers introduced the basic information of iGEM together with several creative projects to make clear the goals of synthetic biology. In question-and-answer section, students were all passionate to discuss with our team members about various aspects from our project details this year to the requirements of becoming a good iGEMer next year. Qiushi Science Summer Camp acted as an opportunity to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology indeed.
