Ghost Sensor
In order to detect large molecules such as protein, we use bacterial ghost technique to make tunnels through inner and outer membrane while at the same time keep periplasmic space intact.
In the second part, we want to detect and destroy a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide that can cause flu-like symptoms when it contaminates drinking water.
