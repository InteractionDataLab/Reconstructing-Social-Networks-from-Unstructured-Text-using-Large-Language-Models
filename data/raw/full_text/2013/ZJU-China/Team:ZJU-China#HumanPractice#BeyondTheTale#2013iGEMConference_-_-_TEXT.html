2013 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference
NCTU_Formosa contribute to iGEM team collaboration and held a fantastic conference involving Hong_Kong_HKU, NYMU-Taipei, NTU-Taida, NTU_Taiwan, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and ZJU-China. This conference was like a simulated iGEM Jamboree. We gave presentation of our Ghost sensor & Atrazine killer to all of these teams, intriguing many iGEM fellows to ask specific questions. Every one had a good time in Hsinchu, Taiwan and we really felt grateful for the nice job NCTU did.
Team member Jin Huang talked with NCTU_Formosa’s team member- Huizhong Lee about our project.
We made great friends & enjoyed in IGEM together！
