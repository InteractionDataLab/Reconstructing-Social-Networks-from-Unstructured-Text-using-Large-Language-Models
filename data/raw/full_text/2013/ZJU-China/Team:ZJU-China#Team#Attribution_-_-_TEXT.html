Before Regional jamboree
The project is mainly separated into two parts: the bacterial ghost sensor project and the dual-bacterial atrazine killer project. We also paid special attention to the biosafety issues with biomineral shell, holin-anitiholin system and ccdB circuit. Besides, standardized riboswitches have been characterized to invest their performance. Human practice is also an important part in our project and we devoted ourselves to the promotion of synthetic biology.
Angli Xue, the team leader, was in charge of all teamwork and assured everything was in order.
Jiasheng Wang was in charge of the whole experiment, mainly the bacterial ghost sensor project.
Zukai Liu was in charge of the atrazine elf project.
Yujie Chen was in charge of financial affairs and the characterization part.
Ke Ding was in charge of the safety experiment.
Wenjia Gu was in charge of the safety experiment and information collecting.
Lifeng Zhang was in charge of the Characterization part.
Xiaoyue Yang was in charge of the Human practice and writing the tale of aptamers, also participated in other wet lab work.
Congcong Xing was in charge of communicating and connecting with other schools and teams.
After Regional jamboree
After regional jamboree, as we think the Bacterial Ghost should be more valuable and applicable, we decided to focus on the Bacterial Ghost and further the project into three parts on the basis of bacterial ghost: the sensor, the sponge and the shell. We also added a new criteria when characterize the standardized riboswitches.
