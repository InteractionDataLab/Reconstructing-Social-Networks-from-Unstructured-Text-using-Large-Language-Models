The Tale of Ghost and Elf: Chapter four
Summer slept a wink. She kept trying various methods to crack what this yellow powder was so that if there was a danger that she could find. Deep inside, she believed that the quieter, the more dangerous.
Experimental research was inconclusive, Summer had to get out of the lab to see if there was any changes. Once she was out of the lab, she found that the house view had totally changed, all the plants far less dynamic. They just looked like they were groaning. Summer felt pain at that moment, but more of a rage. "Who did it! "
Leaning against the glass, four little guys were clearly stunned, one reason was the sight outside of the house, the other reason was that after a whole night of fighting, their goddess didn’t advance any further to solve the problem, which had never happened before. You would never know what is in her little mind. The little prince also woke up. He stunned after he saw the view outside.
Summer struggled to run outside, taking a variety of grass, leaves, flowers, soil, and the air as samples to her lab for testing. Nothing can beat the Flame Angel. After many times of fighting, she finally found out the cause. Unintentionally, she touched a book while there were no results in her tests. That book about pesticide was borrowed from a library in earth and had never been returned back. After one minute, she recalled that a doctor from the earth once talked with her about that drug. And after testing the soil, she convinced that thought. After 20 times purifying, she got some transparent crystal C8H14ClN5. There was no doubt that it came from the Earth. But the rest part of its remains was unknown. Why did these things fly to her planet? It was really strange. Maybe she should pay a visit to the earth recently. Before proceeding, Summer belly began to growl. She remembered that she had a guest. Fortunately, she was ready for it!
“Little prince, you here?”
“Well, what can I do for you?”
“There are some fast-food I had made a year ago in my storage room. Can you help me to heat two please? I am busy dealing with the problem.”
“A year ago?”
“Don’t worry. They are edible, full of nutrition, and absolutely delicious! Little Dot and Mr Careless lead the way please. Wind and Lily, will you come here?”
“Yes, sir!”Four kids replied together.
Wind and Lily came to Summer’s lab. Watching Summer’s serious expression, they knew that they had been arranged to complete a mission. They were loyal guys because they would do whatever they can to protect their home and master.
“You two are the best partners.”
They smiled to each other. Indeed, they can communicate in a language that no one else could understand which was efficient. So, the two would finish their task in the shortest time. According to the urgency they met, nothing could wait.
