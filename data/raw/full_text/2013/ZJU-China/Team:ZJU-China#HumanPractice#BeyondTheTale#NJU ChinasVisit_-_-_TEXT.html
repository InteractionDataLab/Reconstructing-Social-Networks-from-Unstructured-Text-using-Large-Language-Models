NJU_China Visit Our Team
NJU_China has a very good relationship with our team. On May 15th, their team leader Fei Gong came to visit our lab and team with his three members. We introduced each team’s project and gave some comments to each other. After this meeting, we had a nice meal and discussed some further issues between the two teams.
