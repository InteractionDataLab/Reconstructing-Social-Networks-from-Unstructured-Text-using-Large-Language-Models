What is the disadvantage of a common biphase riboswitch? And why we want to purpose a novel design principle based on the idea of a triphase riboswitch? Here we compared the general model of the biphase and triphase riboswitch, to demonstrate the differences. We started with a coursedcoarse-grained description of the riboswitch function, in order to construct a model to yield a detailed relationship between the ligand concentration (L) and protein levels (P). In this diagram, only the dominant conformations calculated, and the noise is neglected. In the general model, the three major mechanisms were considered: translational repression, transcriptional termination and the mRNA degradation. And to simplifyied the model, firstly at first we only considered the thermodynamically driven regime[] of the model, in which all the conformational changeings are reversible.
