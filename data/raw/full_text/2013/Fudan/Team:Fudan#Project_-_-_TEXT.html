A Novel Aminoglycoside Detection Strategy
This summer, we focus on the detection of a group of antibiotics called aminoglycosides (for example the Kanamycin we used as a selection marker). The problem of aminoglycosides are more serious compared with other kinds of antibiotics,because they are difficult to be break down and tested, and they are most commonly used in the research, medical treatment, industry and agriculture. Even under the high temperature they are not easy to be inactivated. Moreover, they will maintain in the blood for weeks, much more than other kinds of antibiotics such as penicillin. The accumulation of aminoglycoside will also lead to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
By studying the regulation of resistance, we have found the natural parts which are sensitive to the antibiotics. With the quantitative methods, we are measuring the response curve of them. Then the optimized devices will be constructed for aminoglycosides detection.
Meanwhile, we are also studying on the molecular dynamics and mechanisms of regulation of resistance. By modifying and estimating one riboswitch conserved in plenty of aminoglycoside acetyl transferases and aminoglycoside adenyl transferases, we are trying to find a novel principle to design and develop the bicistron-based translation initiation elements which can function more precisely and reliably.
