SAFETY QUESTIONS
1.Please describe the chassis organism(s) you will be using for this project. If you will be using more than one chassis organism, provide information on each of them:
2.Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a.Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Yes. It may cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may effect kidneys. So, it is necessary to use standard safety protection for working in laboratory, including gloves, masker, glasses, and alcohol for sterilization.
b.Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
It may cause pandemic disease if by accident release to the general public. In this case, we use E. coli as our biological material. As NIH Guidelines that released on March 2013, E.coli include in RG1, which are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. So we could prevent the bigger risk happen.
c.Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
Yes. If its concentration more than the limit, it could make environmental pollution. There is probability it mixed in the water source (exp. river, lake, etc), and drunk by people, it also could cause disease for human. So we should provide strong regulations to release the biological materials.
d.Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
Yes. If the concentration is more than the limit, it could cause disease (point a). Individuals, groups, or even country may use biological materials to create crisis or using it in war to poison or even kill their competitors. Biological materials could be very sensitive and dangerous, if we do not use them wisely.
3.If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
The pollution to environment could develop higher if the safety regulation does not work as the expectation. If the methods release to public, there will be possibility of misuses by irresponsible person/institution. The regulation related to the issue should be seriously handling.
4.Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
Yes, we do. Food and Drugs of Controller Institution. Link : www.pom.go.id
5.According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? (Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features
According to WHO Bisafety Manual, rating of our lab is into category 1, which is basic teaching and research laboratory.
