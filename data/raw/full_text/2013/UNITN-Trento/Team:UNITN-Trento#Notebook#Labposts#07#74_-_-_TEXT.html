{"date" : "2013-07-30","author" : "gabriele","title" : "pLAC to SAMsynthetase","content" : "I digested pSB1C3+pLac with PstI-HF and SpeI and SAMsynthetase (PCR insert) with PstI-HF and XbaI, using the 'short' protocol (1.5 µg of insert, 1 µg of plasmid, for 2h at 37°C). Then I treated as usual the plasmid with SAP and the insert with DpNI and purified them. The yields of the purification was too low, I was able to perform only Ctrl, 1:1 and 1:2 ligations.","tags" : "SAMsynthetase-pLac"}
