",  "content" : "  in these last days we got our two final complete circuits!! Both my cloning and pedro’s succeeded so now we have a circuit that produces amilCP+EFE with blue light, and a circuit that produces amilGFP+EFE in the dark. We took some gas cromatografic measurements afterr an evaluated induction time with our LED to see if the devices actually produces ethylene. We could only see a really huge peak) ethylene in the sample under blue light with the final circuit with inverter. So the circuit with inverter seems to work, at least usually. We could not observe ethylene with the circuit that I cloned though. ",  "tags" : "blue_light" }
