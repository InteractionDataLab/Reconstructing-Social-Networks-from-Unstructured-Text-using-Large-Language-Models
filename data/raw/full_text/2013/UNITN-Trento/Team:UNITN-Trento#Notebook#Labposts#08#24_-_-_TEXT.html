We purified the digestions and the final quantification were :
Quatification results
part
initial amount digested
quantification after purification
EFE
all PCR
19.5 ng/µl
AraCpBAD
3µg
38.3 ng/µl
s04617
3µg
13µg
Then we ligate following this protocol . With the part s04617 (pFixK-cI-pLambda) we could do only the 1:2 ligation and the control because of the very small amount of destination vector. Then we transformed the Neb5α cells following the classical transformation protocol .",  "tags" : "pFixK-cI-pLambda-EFE-AraCpBAD" }
