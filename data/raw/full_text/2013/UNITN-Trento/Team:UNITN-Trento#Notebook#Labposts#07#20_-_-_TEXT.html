Inocula
Unfortunately The day before were inoculate uncorrect plates(03/7) so I have purified them following the purification protocol these are the results of the quantification.

Afterwards I screened 800 ng of  the samples following the screening protocol with EcoR1 HF and Pst1, these are the results of the gel:

As we can see only the third(024) sample shows the insert at the right size of 1000 bp(the lower band), then I did the inocula of the plates of 5/07(1:1,1:2,1:3) and of the old plate that gives right results to amplify 024(1:1).","tags" : "K823024-K823026-E0840"}
