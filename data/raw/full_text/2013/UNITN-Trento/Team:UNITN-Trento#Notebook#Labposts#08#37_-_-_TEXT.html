We deactivated enzymes, added SAP, deactivated it, then started the ligation: following the protocol, we used concentration values for both parts= 20 ng/ul. We made the control sample and three ligation samples (1:1, 1:2, 1:3); we transformed and plated them.Meanwhile I took back the experiments with the complete device, so I repeated the dilution cultures (5 ml this time) and tried it again, with a Blue lamp and a less intense LED induction. Moreover I induced with blue light the “mask plates” ,with the entire device, to see if colonies produce blue color if induced.Furthermore I inoculate some colonies from Viola’s plate containing the part S04617+EFE.",  "tags" : " BlueLight_amilCP-B0015- S04617+EFE " }
