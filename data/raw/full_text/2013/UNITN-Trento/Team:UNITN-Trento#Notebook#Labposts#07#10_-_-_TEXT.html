We lost kind of the whole bacillus that we had, during the night, cause the liquid cultures were disrupted in the shaker at 26!! Luckily we have a survivor, the liquid culture at 37, and all the plates.
From the survivor we made further liquid cultures ( at 26°, 1:50 and 1:100; at 37° 1:50 and 1:100)
As soon as they became very cloudy we went along with the glycerol stock preparation and put our bacillus at -80°. The one that weren’t cloudy have been kept in the shaker all night long.
In the afternoon we inoculated some colonies from the plates in 5 ml of nutrient broth +starch.","tags" : " Bacillus subtilis"}
