In order to do that we exploited the same primers used in our previous attempt (see 06-06-2013).For the protocol used see the RBC Taq PCR protocol ..When the reaction finished, we tested the presence of the aplificate product througt an electrophoresis analisys (adding 2 µl of LD for 10 µl of DNA).Results:
Gel Image
As you can see from our gel image, our product is present in both reactions (TAQ and TAQ+Phusion).After purifying our products we find out that the concentration of DNA that we obtained is too low (about 5ng/ul) maybe for an experimental error in setting the PCR program. For this reason, our team is going to redo the PCR reaction again.",  "tags" : "SAMsynthetase" }
