{  "date":"2013-08-31",  "author":"fabio",  "title":"  the blue circuit doesn’t always work!! ",  "content":"  I repeated the experiment with light induction lots and lots of times, but unfortunately a few time cells behaved strangely: even the dark control produced amilCP... probably the circuit is not perfectly regulated!! Now I have to think about a new cloning: pedro will try out a ligation of the circuit with EFE, instead I will try to insert EFE at the end of the improved circuit without inverter. I will do a PCR of the improved part with Kapa polymesase and then inserting this sequence inside the plasmid containing EFE +terminators. Then we will have ethylene production upon illumination.
