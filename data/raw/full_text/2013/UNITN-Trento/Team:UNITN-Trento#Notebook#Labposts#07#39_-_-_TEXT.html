{"date" : "2013-07-18","author" : "thomas-michele","title" : "Back to work","content" : "Today, after a long and hard fight with our thesis, we came back to work. In particular we teased the 2012 Registry Distribution and we extracted two new parts: BBa_K537055 (679 bp) and BBa_K537056 (721 bp). These two parts contained two reportes gene, mCherry and Venus. We did this because we wanted to fuse at the C-term of BBa_K1065001 a reporter in order to measure the kinetic of the protein sythesis. A new chapter to add to our team!
