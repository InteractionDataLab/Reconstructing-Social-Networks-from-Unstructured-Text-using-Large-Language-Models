{"date" : "2013-07-10","author" : "gabriele-viola","title" : "Reboot: starting from the beginning","content" : "Since the new forward primer (with the entire prefix) arrived, I started again from the beginning.
SAM synthetase extraction
The new primer forward has just the EcoRI restriction site added at its beginning (complete prefix):
GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGAAGGAGGAACTACTATGGCAAAACACCTTTTT
It has a Tm = 68.7°C.
Then I performed two Phusion PCR (one GC and one HF) and one Phusion/RBC PCR to identify the best protocol for SAM synthetase extraction with the new primer.

The products of these three PCRs were then loaded on a 1% agarose gel.

As showed by the gel, only the Phusion/RBC PCR was successful.
Purifications
Then, I purified the EX-SAMsynthetase-SP sample produced today with the Phusion/RBC PCR, and the 5 R0010 PCR insert that were amplified on tuesday 02/07 .

OverNight Purification
Then, Viola was so polite to prepare the O/N digestion mixes ( with the usual protocol ) and incubate them at 37°C. An EX-SAMsynthetase-SP sample (RBC#3 from today, 103.6ng/µl) and a linear pSB1C3 sample (G3A from 01/07 , 44.8ng/µl) were restricted with XbaI and PstI (Nebuffer2).
