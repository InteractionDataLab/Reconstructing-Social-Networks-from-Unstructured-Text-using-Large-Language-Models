Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team , have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2013 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in the project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We have constructed, characterized and submitted 6 new Parts helpful for the creation of a photo inducible fruit ripening  control circuit, but not only. These are our entries:
BBa_K1065001 , BBa_K1065002 , BBa_K1065102 , BBa_K1065302 , BBa_K1065305 , BBa_K1065310 .
We also have submitted many other useful parts, check our complete list .
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction work as expected.
The device BBa_K1065001 was used to successfully produce ethylene and to ripen all of the fruit that we tested!
The following parts built by us were also shown to work as expected: BBa_K1065302 , BBa_K1065310 .
Document the characterization of this part in the 'Main Page' of that Part's/Device's Registry entry Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Describe in the wiki one or more ways in which the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
We have thoroughly analysed the possible pathways available in nature for ethylene production. The choice of the right pathway was done keeping always in mind safety and environmental issues. For example, we decided not to use the plant ethylene pathway, which would produce also cyanide...! Also B. fruity was designed with a photoinducible control system, to provide a safe alternative to commercial ripening methods that exploit ethylene.    Check our Safety page for specific info.
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, enter this information in the 'Experience' section of that Parts's Registry entry, create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We have improved 1 existing BioBricks from the registry: BBa_K952003 .
Our new entries for this part are:
BBa_K1065302 (new entry for BBa_K952003 );
BBa_K1065305 (new entry for BBa_K952003 ).
We also have resubmitted in pSB1C3 two parts from the Eau de coli MIT 2006 project that were discontinued. We hope that these parts will be included in the 2014 registry and will be soon available to many other teams.
Our entries for these parts are:
BBa_K1065100 (new entry for BBa_J45119 );
BBa_K1065103 (new entry for BBa_J45319 ).
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We have designed an innovative way to provide the consumer with ready-to-eat fruit that exploits our engineered bacterial system. For more details visit the Vending Machine page .
These are our best characterized parts on the system Best natural part BBa_K1065002 , 2-Oxoglutarate Oxygenase/Decarboxylase Ethylene Forming Enzyme (EFE). This part was well characterized under the control of different inducible promoters in both E. coli (NEB10beta cells) and in B. subtilis (str.168). Best engineered device
BBa_K1065310 , blue light regulated amilCP producing device. This device includes an inverter cassette (composed by cI protein and pLambda promoter) that ultimately allows production of the chromoprotein amilCP only when the culture is exposed to light. Best improved part
BBa_K1065305 , blue light regulated amilGFP producing device (a yellow fluorescent protein). The part BBa_K952003 , extracted from the registry, was not working because it was missing the RBS between pFixK2 promoter and amilGFP coding sequence. We improved this part by mutagenesis and demonstrated that it is able to produce amilGFP in the dark. .
