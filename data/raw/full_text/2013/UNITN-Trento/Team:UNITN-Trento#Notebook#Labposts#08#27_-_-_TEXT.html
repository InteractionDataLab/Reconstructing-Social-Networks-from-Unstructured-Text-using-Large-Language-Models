We decided to amplify both parts by PCR following this protocol . BBa_Fwd and BBa_Rev primers were adopted. PCR products were then screened, purified and quantified at the nanodrop..
Gel image
As you can see from the picture, the gel confirmed our PCR reaction since in lane 1 there is a band at heigh of 1215 bp (BBa_K1065002) and in lane 3 one band at heigh of 1245 bp (BBa_S04617). Kapa universal ladder was adopted.We proceeded then performing an o/n digestion on the following parts in order to do a tri Assembly:

EFE+B0015
XbaI+PstI
104.7 ng/µl

EcorI+SpeI
133.5 ng/µl
Tomorrow we will proceed with a ligation of the three digestion products..!",  "tags" : "pFixK-cI-pLambda-EFE" }
