171ng/µl
Afterwards, I digested 800ng of each sample  with Spe1-HF and Pst1-HF following the digestion protocol for screening . Finally I ran the products on a gel (1,5% agarose, due to the short length of the insert: only 200 bp + prefix and suffix). I loaded 12µl of a ladder 100bp prepared as follows:
Ladder

This time, I loaded 12µl (10µl of sample and 2µl of glicerol solution 30%) of each sample.

We can see 2 bands: the highest is the backbone (pSB1A2: 2079bp) and the lower is pLac (nearly 243bp, located between the bands 300 and 200bp of the ladder).
After the screening I digested 3µg of the pSB1A2+R0010 (sample #2) with SpeI and PstI-HF o/n following the usual protocol.",  "tags" : "Plac" }
