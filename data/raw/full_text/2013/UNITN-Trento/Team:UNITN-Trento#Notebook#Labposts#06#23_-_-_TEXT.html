SAMsynthetase+RFP (1:2) = too many to count.
SAMsynthetase+RFP (ctrl) = too many to count.
SAMsynthetase (1:2) = 11 colonies.
SAMsynthetase (ctrl) = 12 colonies.
SAMsynthetase+pSB1C3[RFP] (1:2) plate
SAMsynthetase+pSB1C3[RFP] (ctrl) plate
SAMsynthetase+pSB1C3 (1:2) plate
SAMsynthetase+pSB1C3 (ctrl) plate
Performed 5 inocula for each of the two 1:2 plates, in 5ml LB with 5µl CM. Tomorrow miniprep, quantification, digestion and gel to control what happened.",  "tags" : "SAMsynthetase" }
