I made the screening test. To do that we digested 1500 ng of DNA with EcorI and PstI following the screening digestion protocol .
I used a 1.5% concentration of agarose to create a gel and I used Ethidium bromide instead the normal EuroSafe. In addition I have not used a normal Dye with the 20ul of sample loaded but I used 4ul of 30% glycerol. ",  "tags" : "lacOid-PliaG-Pgram+" }
