We tried to work together on each aspect of the project, however each of us had a specific task to facilitate the work.
Idea
B. fruity starts from an initial idea of Caterina and was further developed and implemented by the entire team
Cloning
Everybody cloned at least 1 or more biobricks, however our cloning queen was Caterina.
Ethylene subteam

SUPPORT
Cristina Del Bianco for her unvaluable help and constant omnipresence. Our main contact for support, was able to guide us from beginning to end of the project, keeping the team united and focused on results. She also was our Instructor for an exciting Synbio/iGEM training course in the Spring!
Sheref Mansy and Olivier Jousson helped us during our brainstorming and were available in the summer for consultation;
Paola Torre helped with lab protocol procedures;
Rossella Tomazzolli, Margherita Kos and Matteo Grott ensured a fantastic laboratory space;
The laboratory of Atomic and Molecular Physics Laboratory of the University of Trento for access to all gas chromatography equipment. Damiano Avi and Marco Scapinello for help troubleshooting the protocol for ethylene and MeSA detection;
Compression tests on fruit were done in the Industrial Engineering Department (laboratory of polymers and composites, prof. Alessandro Pegoretti) under the supervision of Andrea Dorigato;
Colorimetric assays on fruit were done in the Industrial Engineering Department ( Laboratory of Supercritical Fluids , Eng. Sara Spilimbergo) under the supervision of Giovanna Ferrentino;
Angelo Digiacomo helped us with the graphical design of B. fruity vending machine.
We would like also to thank:
the University of Trento for supporting this initiative
the Centre for Integrative Biology and prof. Alessandro Quattrone for providing materials and access to instrumentation;
The Mansy lab for sharing materials and protocols;
prof. Graziano Guella and prof. Ines Mancini for helpful chemistry suggestions;
Marzia Filippi, from the Safety office, for revising our safety measurements;
LMU Munich iGEM team 2012 and prof. Mascher for sending us their Bacillus subtilis plasmids;
The laboratory of Dr. W. Winkler at the University of Maryland and the Groeningen iGEM team 2013 for sharing Bacillus subtilis protocols;
Michele Forlin for modelling advices;
Michele Forlin and Fabio Chizzolini for being such great teaching assistants during the Spring.
