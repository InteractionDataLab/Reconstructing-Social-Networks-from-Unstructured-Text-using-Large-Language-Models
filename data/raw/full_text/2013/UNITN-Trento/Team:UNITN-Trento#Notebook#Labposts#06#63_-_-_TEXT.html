{  "date" : "2013-06-27",  "author" : "thomas",  "title" : "Toxicity test on 5mM Arabinose induced EFE Cells",  "content" : "In order to evalutate if the expression of EFE is toxic or not to our cells I created a growth curve. I started from an inoculum of AraCpBAD + EFE that I prepared yesterday. I diluited 50ul of the overnight culture in 5ml of LB and I incubated at 37C with shaker until the cultures reached approximately 0,6 O.D at 600nm. I took 2 samples for negative controls and 2 samples for the induced cells. After that I added 25ul of Arabinose 1M stock solution to the induced samples (5mM working solution) and I registered the O.D. of the samples one time per hour (for 4 hours). In the end I plotted the results.
Plot
As expected, the strong induction of our gene slightly influences on growth-rate (caused by stress) but still is not completely toxic.
To confirm this result I made a toxicity test by serial dilution. I diluited 50ul of overnight culture (one induced sample and one not induced) into 9,5ml of LB. After vortexed the samples, I further diluited them 1:10 for three times. In the end I plated 150ul of each dilution onto Chloramhenicol Plates.
Dilution 1:1000 induced
Dilution 1:1000 not induced
As you can see from the images, there's not big differences in the colony forming ability of the induced and the not induced sample, even in a dilution of 1:1000. Maybe I should dilute them more!",  "tags" : "EFE" }
