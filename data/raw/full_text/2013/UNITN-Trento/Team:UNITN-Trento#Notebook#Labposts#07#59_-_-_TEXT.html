I must admit that I don't get how it is possible to have red inocula when I treated the linearized-by-PCR pSB1C3 with the DpnI enzyme... that's crazy... anyway the quantification results are the following:

Screening digestion
Screening was performed with BamHI-HF and PstI-HF. While PstI-HF cuts at the suffix (the end of the insert), BamHI-HF is able to cut only SAMsynthetase at 102th base position. So, the screening digestion will show one band at nearly 3100bp if pSB1C3 contains Plac+RFP, at nearly 2000bp if an 'empty' pSB1C3 is present and two bands (one at nearly 2200bp and the other at nearly 1000bp) if we have pSB1C3 with SAMsynthetase.

The screening digestions were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and the run on a 1% agarose gel.

As you can see, the gel shows a band at nearly 2kbp and one at nearly 1kbp at the 13S lane, so that sample should contain the desired construct (pSB1C3+SAMsynthetase).","tags" : "SAMsynthetase"}
