SAM synthetase extraction
Last time I determined the correct protocol to extract SAM synthetase from the E. coli using the new plasmid (at the end, the protocol was the usual one ). I performed three PCRs (G1, G2, G3) and run the products on 1% agarose gel.

Ligation
At first, I added 1µl of SAP to pSB1C3 O/N digestion and 1µl of DpnI to SAMsynthetase O/N digestion, and incubated the samples at 37°C for 1.5h. Then I quantified the digestions.

Then I performed the ligation and left the reaction run for 2h at room temperature.
