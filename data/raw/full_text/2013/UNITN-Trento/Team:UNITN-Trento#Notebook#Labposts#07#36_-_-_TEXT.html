Screening with AgeI
First, Caterina performed a screening using AgeI on the \"1:1 A\" sample from 15/07 .

But then we realized the Gabriele was mistaken, AgeI is able to cut both Plac+RFP and SAMsynthetase so it is not the correct enzyme to perform the screening with...
Short digestion
Gabriele then performed a short digestion (aka: a digestion similar to the screening run for 2 hours) with the sample G2_EX-SAMsynth-SP (62.6ng/µl from 15/07 ) and G4A_linear-pSB1C3 (41.9ng/µl from 01/07 ).

After the 2 hours of incubation, Gabriele added 1µl of DpnI to the G2 sample and 1µl of SAP to the G4A sample and incubated them at 37°C for 1h.
Digestions purification
After that, Gabriele purificated both today's short digestion and the O/N digestion from yesterday .

Short digest Ligation
So, Gabriele performed a ligation of the short digested samples.

Finally, Gabriele performed a ligation of the overnight digested samples.
