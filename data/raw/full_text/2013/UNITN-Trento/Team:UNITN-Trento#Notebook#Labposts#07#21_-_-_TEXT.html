This time however, I used the same vial used during the ethylene detection experiment . This time the experiment worked as expected and I successfully plotted the data.
Plot
A sample of the same stock culture was kept inthermoshaker. As expected an higher value of ethylene was detected (see the green point) since it was subjected to only one measure (thus having no gas loss due to repeated measures). ","tags" : "EFE"}
