Emil followed the transformation protocol loading 150 ng of each sample.Then Emil plated the product on an Ampicillin plate.
Moreover Emil did the inocula (in LB + Ampicillin) of two backbones(BBa_823024 and BBa_823026) from the plates of Fabio and Bruno(2 inocula for each sample).",  "tags" : "BBa_823024-BBa_823026-BBa_E0240-BBa_E0840-B. subtilis" }
