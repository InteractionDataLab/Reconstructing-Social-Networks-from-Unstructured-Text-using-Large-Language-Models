(1) PCR: SAM synthetase amplification
I amplified SAM synthetase by performing a PCR on the samples G1 and E2 from 17/06 .
Sample
Quantification
G1
80ng/µl
E2
60ng/µl
The PCR was performed following the usual SAM extraction protocol .

PCR results were then run on a 1% agarose gel:

G1
E2
Since the gel shows two bands at nearly 1200bp, the PCR results are confirmed. The PCR products were then purified with the Promega kit .

(2) pSB1A2+R0010+SAMsynthetase ligation screening
Then I screened the inocula from the 26/06 ligation. First I miniprepped the inocula:

252.1ng/µl

1:3
A
345.7ng/µl
B
147.0ng/µl
C
268.0ng/µl
The samples were then digested using the screening digestion protocol and then run on a 1% agarose gel.

1:3 C
Given that the gel shows only two bands (one at nearly 2kbp and the other at 200bp), SAM synthetase is not present and the ligation failed.
(3) Linear pSB1C3 purification
I also purified with the usual protocol the linearized pSB1C3 from 19/06 .
Sample
Type
Quantity
G2
linear pSB1C3
74.4ng/µl

G3A
linear pSB1C3
44.8ng/µl
G4A
linear pSB1C3
41.9ng/µl
(4) O/N Digestion
Finally, I prepared an overnight digestion of the samples G1 (SAM synthetase) and G2 (linear pSB1C3) to try again the ligation tomorrow. I followed the usual protocol .
