{  "date" : "2013-06-28",  "author" : "thomas",  "title" : "Ethylene detection through microGC!!!",  "content" : "In order to see if our EFE enzyme is effectively active and functional I made a gas-cromatography analysis.
Starting from an overnight culture, I diluted it 1:100 and I incubated it until it reached 0,5 O.D.600. After that, I added 5mM of Arabinose and I incubated the culture at 37°C for about 4-5 hours. In the I connected the vial previously keeped ermetically closed at the micro GC and I took the measure. I did this work for three samples: negative control (not induced), 5mM Arabinose V=1,5ml and 5mM Arabinose V=3ml.

As you can see, seems that the device is correct and functionally active! Definetely a good result!",  "tags" : "EFE" }
