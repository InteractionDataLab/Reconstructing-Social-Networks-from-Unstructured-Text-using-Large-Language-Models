Then we performed a digestion with EcoRI and PstI of this 4 minipreps, SAM (another time because we were not satisfied of the previous results!) and two pSB1C3. After the digestion we did a gel to understand if it was our lucky day. As you can see from the picture, evidently not!

In the afternoon we prepared two PCR reactions: one for J45700 (from the miniprep = it’s the complete device!) and one to linearize and to amplify the pSB1C3 vector. Both the reactions failed and we were too disappointed to take a picture of the gel.Finally we made another digestion for J45319, J45119 and Cate’s pSB1C3  with EcoRI and PstI.
