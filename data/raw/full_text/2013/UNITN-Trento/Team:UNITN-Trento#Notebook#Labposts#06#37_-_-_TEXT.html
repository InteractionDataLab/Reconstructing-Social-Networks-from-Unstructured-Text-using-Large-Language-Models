Attack of the Insert",  "content" : "This morning we added 1µl of SAP to the pSB1C3 overnight digestion and 1µl of DpN1 to the SAMsynthetase overnight digestion, then both were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours.
During these 1.5 hours, we performed the miniprep ( protocol ) and quantification of the circular pSB1C3 inocula of yesterday.

After the incubation, we purified the digestion mixes using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System and then quantified.

SAMsynthetase E1 was stocked at -20°C.
Then, we performed the ligation of pSB1C3 and SAMsynthetase exploiting the usual protocol .

We incubated the ligation mixes for 2 hours at room temperature.
Also, we extracted R0010 promoter (Plac) from the registry (2013 distribution kit, plate 3, well 3H). Unfortunately, we also extracted a part from the same plate and well of the 2012 distribution kit (BBa_K115032) because we mistook the kits.
Finally, we transformed NEB10β competent cells with the usual protocol , we used the following quantities of DNA: 10µl of each ligation product except for the 1:4 ligation, of which we used 15µl, and 1µl of the extracted R0010. Then, we plated on CM plates.",  "tags" : "SAMsynthetase" }
