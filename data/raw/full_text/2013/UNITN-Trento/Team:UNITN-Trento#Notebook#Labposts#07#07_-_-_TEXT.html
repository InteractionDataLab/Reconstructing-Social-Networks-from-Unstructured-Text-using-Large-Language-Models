Quantification
Sample
Quantification
BBa_E0840
15.8ng/µl
BBa_K823026
37.6ng/µl
BBa_K823024
36.4ng/µl
Then I performed the ligation(1:1,1:3,CTRL) of the GFP with the 2 backbone individually and following the ligation protocol .Finally I transformed 10µl of the ligation protocol in Neb10β and plate them on ampicillin LB agar following the transformation protocol .","tags" : "E0840-K823026-K823024"}
