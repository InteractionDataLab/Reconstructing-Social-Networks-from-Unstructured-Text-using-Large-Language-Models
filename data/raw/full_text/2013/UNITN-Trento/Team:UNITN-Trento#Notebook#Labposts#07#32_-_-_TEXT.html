What happened to the inocula???
First, I wanted to miniprep 3 inocula... but two were RED!!! So sad, the RFP was present... that's because I forgot to treat the linear plasmid with DpnI :(
I miniprepped the only not-red inoculum, the \"1:1 A\" which had a concentration of 230.5ng/µl. Then I stocked the sample at -20°C. The possible presence of Plac+RFP is a problem since it is nearly as long as the SAM synthetase gene. So, for the screening, I need an enzyme that cuts only one (either SAM synthetase OR Plac+RFP) forming two fragment with aΔlength higher than 500bp (otherwise it is impossible to distinguish the two bands). Then enzyme that we will use is AgeI.
Another digestion
So, I purified the SAM synthetase extracted through PCR on 11/07 .

Quantity
G1
116.7ng/µl
G2
62.6ng/µl
G3
82ng/µl
Then I added 1µl of DpnI to the linear pSB1C3 sample (G2A from 01/07 ) and incubated it at 37°C for 1 hour. Then I prepared an overnight digestion following the usual protocol .
