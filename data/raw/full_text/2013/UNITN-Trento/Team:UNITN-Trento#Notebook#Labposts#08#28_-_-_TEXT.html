S04617 + EFE ligation 1:2 sample 1
459 ng/µl
S04617 + EFE ligation 1:2 sample 2
603.2 ng/µl
S04617 + EFE ligation 1:2 sample 3
294.2 ng/µl
AraCpBAD - EFE ligation 1:1 sample 1
434.4 ng/µl
AraCpBAD - EFE ligation 1:1 sample 2
346.3 ng/µl
AraCpBAD - EFE ligation 1:2 sample 1
351.4 ng/µl
AraCpBAD - EFE ligation 1:2 sample 2
293.7 ng/µl
We proceeded then performing a screening digestion followed by an electrophoresis analysis. Kapa universal ladder was adopted.
Gel image
As you can see from the image, AraCpBAD + EFE (BBa_K1065002) part is confirmed for all the 3 samples (lane 1 to 3, 2426 bp). Differently, BBa_S04617 + EFE (BBa_K1265002) is not confirmed (lane 5 to 7, 2460 bp expected) since the band is at an heigh of about 1400 bp. Probably the destination vector BBa_S04617 was closed itself without incorporating EFE.",  "tags" : "pFixK-cI-pLambda-EFE-AraCpBAD" }
