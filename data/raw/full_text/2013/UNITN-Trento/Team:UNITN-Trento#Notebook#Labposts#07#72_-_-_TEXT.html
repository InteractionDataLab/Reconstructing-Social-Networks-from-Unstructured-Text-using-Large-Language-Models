This was the first time that I met Bacillus in my life... I have to be honest: I didn't fall in love with it immediately!! I tried to make it sporulate by following step by step the 2012 Munich Igem Team \"spore germination assay\"(link protocollo). At the end of the day with Paola we tried to observe the spores in the hemocytometer with the microscope. The spores were clearly visible but we were not able to take a picture.
