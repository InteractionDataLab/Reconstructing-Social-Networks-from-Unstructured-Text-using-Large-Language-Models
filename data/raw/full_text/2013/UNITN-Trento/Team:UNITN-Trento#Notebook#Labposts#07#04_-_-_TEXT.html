SAM synthetase ligation in (linear) pSB1C3
First of all, early in the morning I added 1µl of DpnI to the SAMsynthetase#G2 O/N digestion and 1µl of SAP to the linear_pSB1C3#G2 digestion and then incubated them at 37°C for 1.5 hours (afterward I inhibited the enzyme with 20 minutes at 80°C).
Then, I purified and quantified the two digestion samples:
Sample
Quantity
G1 SAMsynthetase
18.8ng/µl
G2 linear pSB1C3
6.5ng/µl
After that, I performed the ligation (the plasmid had a too low concentration).

And, \"finally\", I transformed the ligations in NEB10β cells.
(2) SAMsynthetase amplification
I amplified SAMsynthetase from the E2 sample (that was purified yesterday ) following the usual protocol . The PCR was performed in triplicates.
The PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel.

As shown in the gel, a band at nearly 1200bp is present, confirming the success of the PCR.
(3) R0010 amplification
I also amplified R0010 from A sample (R0010, 243.7ng/µl) from 27/06 . Being the first time amplifying this sequence, I performed (in triplicates or duplicates) a Phusion PCR using as primers the prefix Fw (Tm = 86°C) and the suffix Rv (Tm = 90°C).

Given that R0010 is 200bp long, the PCR program was the following:

Since R0010 is very short, the PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel using transparent loading dye.

As shown in the gel, a band at nearly 200bp is present in each lane. So, the PCRs were successful!
(4) linear pSB1C3 amplification
I didn't know that linear pSB1C3 is \"impossible\" to amplify, and that the only way to get it is to linearize the circular one. So I tried its amplification and failed.
