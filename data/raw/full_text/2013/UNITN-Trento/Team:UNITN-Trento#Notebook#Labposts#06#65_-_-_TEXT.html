So I did the miniprep of  the 4 inocula(B.subtilis backbones) following the vacuum protocol then I have quantified the products with the following results:
Quantification
Sample
Quantification
BBa_K823024
334.4ng/µl
BBa_K823024
260.6ng/µl
BBa_K823026
306.7ng/µl
BBa_K823026
359.7ng/µl
Moreover I did the inocula of the 2 GFPs(BBa_E0240 and BBa_E0840)(4 inocula for each sample) from the plates previously done.",  "tags" : "K823024-K823026" }
