{  "date" : "2013-08-02",  "author" : "thomas",  "title" : "pSpac + GFP screening",  "content" : "Today I started from the overnight cultures that I did yesterday . I performed a miniprep purification following this protocol . I quantified then the products at the nanodrop obtaining these results:
Quantification results

pXyl-GFP 1
132.7 ng/µl
pXyl-GFP 2
102 ng/µl
pXyl-GFP 3
126 ng/µl
pSpac-GFP 1:1 1
198 ng/µl
pSpac-GFP 1:1 2
322 ng/µl
pSpac-GFP 1:4 1
154 ng/µl
pSpac-GFP 1:4 2
249 ng/µl
pSpac-GFP 1:4 3
196 ng/µl
I proceeded then with a screening digestion in order to confirm the products. Kapa universal Ladder was adopted.

Lane 2,3,4: as you can see, the bands confirmed the reamplification of BBa_K823024 (4974 bp) + BBa_E0840 (878 bp).Lane 5,6,7,8,9: as you can see, the higher band confirmed the vector BBa_K823026 (8289 bp) while the lower band didn't confirm the insert BBa_E0840 (878 bp). I think it took a fusion between BBa_E0840 (878 bp) and RFP coding device (1069 bp) since the band is at the level of 2100 bp and since I had few pellets that were red. So the ligation between pSpac and GFP failed.. I hope that the next time I'll be more lucky! ",  "tags" : "pSpac-GFP-pXyl" }
