{"date" : "2013-07-28","author" : "thomas","title" : "EFE + Venus Expression test: FAILED!","content" : "Starting from an inoculum, I diluted the cells 1:100 in fresh LB and I waited until O.D.600 of the sample reached 0.5. I induced then the cells (V=5ml) with 25 ul of Arabinose (5mM) and I incubated them into thermoshaker at 37°C for 4 hours. One sample were not induced and used as negative control.After 4 hours I tried to use the trans-UV too see any differences between induced sample and control. Both culture had the same color (not fluorescence) so the experiment failed. However the sample was sent for sequencing so now I'll wait the result before restart all the cloning steps..","tags" : "EFE-Venus"}
