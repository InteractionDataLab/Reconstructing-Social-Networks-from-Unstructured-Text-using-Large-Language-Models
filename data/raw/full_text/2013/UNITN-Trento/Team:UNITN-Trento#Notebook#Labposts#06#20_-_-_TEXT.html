{  "date" : "2013-06-12",  "author" : "Gabriele",  "title" : "Ligation and transformation",  "content" : "Ligation of SAMsynthetase and pSB1C3 with and without RFP, so I prepared four samples:
1) pSB1C3 with RFP (Ctrl_1)
2) pSB1C3 with RFP + SAMsynthetase (1:2)
3) pSB1C3 without RFP (Ctrl_2)
4) pSB1C3 without RFP (1:2)
The samples were prepared and ligation was performed following the ligation protocol .
Ligation parameters
Plasmid concentration: 27.8ng/µl
Plasmid length: 2070bp
Insert concentration: 13.2ng/µl
Insert length: 1155bp
Used plasmid: 250µl
Volume of reaction: 35µl
Buffer concentration: 10X
Transformation in NEB10β cells was performed following the transformation protocol .Plates in incubator ON at 37°C static, more than 16 hours.",  "tags" : "SAMsynthetase" }
