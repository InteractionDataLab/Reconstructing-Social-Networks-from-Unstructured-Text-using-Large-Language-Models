As we can see ther are two bands for each well(like expected after the digestion) but only the lower band of the 6 well has the GFP(920 bp) as insert, the other have only the RFP witha promoter.So I decided to repeat the digestion of GFP(an old sample 42.6 ng/µl digested completely) and the same sample of the two backbone exactly like in the previous days .I did the inocula of the new transformation and also of two colonies of the plate that I tooK the E sample from(2 E sample(1:1 024+0840),1 1:1 024+0840,2 1:3 024+0840,2 1:1 026+0840, 2 1:3 026+0840).","tags" : "K832024-K823026-E0840"}
