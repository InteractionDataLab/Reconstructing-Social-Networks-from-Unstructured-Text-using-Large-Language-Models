{  "date" : "2013-06-17",  "author" : "gabriele-emil",  "title" : "SAMsynthetase: like the legend of the phoenix,'all ends with beginning", "content" : "Today we started anew extracting SAMsynthetase from the genome of E. coli strain MG1655, following the usual protocol (2 samples for Gabriele and 2 for Emil). Then we performed an electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel.

Sadly, something went wrong with G2 sample (probably Gabriele forgot to add something to the PCR mix). But the gel is very beautiful!!!
Then G1, E1 and E2 samples were purified using Wizard® SV Gel and PCRClean-Up System and then quantified using the Nanodrop.

G1
80.2ng/µl
E1
65.7ng/µl
E2
60ng/µl
Sadly, the quantities were not so high, but the results was good anyway!
Finally we prepared overnight digestion of SAMsynthetase (G1 and E1, E2 was put at -20°C) and pSB1C3 linearized both with XbaI and PstI-HF, using the digestion protocol . We used Nebuffer4 and the mix were prepared as follows:
