{  "date" : "2013-06-29",  "author" : "emil",  "title" : "Purification and screening of the GFPs E0840 and E0240",  "content" : " I did the miniprep of  the 8 inocula(2 GFP constructs) following the vacuum protocol then I have quantified the products with the following results:

BBa_E0840/1
484.6ng/µl
BBa_E0840/2
376ng/µl
BBa_E0840/3
481.8ng/µl
BBa_E0840/4
475ng/µl
BBa_E0240/1
361ng/µl
BBa_E0240/2
454.4ng/µl
BBa_E0240/3
368ng/µl
BBa_E0240/4
365.8ng/µl
Then I did the screening of the samples E0840/1,E0840/3,E0240/2,E0240/4. I digested 800 ng of each sample with EcoR1-HF and Pst1-HF following the digestion protocol for screening . After 40 minutes I loaded the samples on a gel with the following results:

We can see 2 bands for well: the upper is the backbone(pSB1A2 2079 bp), the lower is presumably the GFP(BBa_E0240 826 bp,BBa_E0840 828 bp)(pefix and suffix escluded ?).",  "tags" : "E0840-E0240" }
