{  "date" : "2013-06-07",  "author" : "gabriele-michele",  "title" : "Third SAMsynthetase synthase extraction attempt - TOO SAD",  "content" : " We've tried another combination to maximize the outputs of the PCR done to amplify the SAMsynthetase synthase gene from an extract of E.coli genomic DNA (strain MG1655). This time we used the RBC Taq DNA Polymerase protocol but with a mix of this polymerase (0.25 ul) and the Phusion polymerase (0.3 ul). We've prepared two identical samples to see who is the better PCR maker! :)
