There were essentially four DNA pieces that we wanted to combine together to make a construct: The tat signal sequence followed by GFP, a small linker region and RFP put into a plasmid backbone. As our cloning techniques rely on overlapping DNA fragments we used mostly primers with overhengs in the PCR reactions. As templates we used the biobricks <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E1010">BBa_E1010</A> for RFP, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0040">BBa_R0040</A> for GFP, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J01101">BBa_J01101</A> for the plasmid backbone and genomic DNA from <I>Escherichia coli</I> strain ER2566 for the tat signal sequence.<B>Table 1:</B> Primers applied in creating the tat_GFP_l_RFP construct.

The linker region is going to be 36 bp long and will be created by overlapping overhangs on the reverse primer of GFP and forward primer of RFP. The primers for the plasmid backbone is designed to include the TetR repressible promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0040">BBa_R0040</A>), RBS (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0034">BBa_R0034</A>) and two terminators (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0010">BBa_R0010</A>) and (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0012">BBa_R0012</A>) in the PCR product.

Red ER1-cells in liquid media was immobilized in agar and then viewed in a confocal microscope for seeing if RFP was localized in the periplasm. The results can be seen in the two figures below:</P><DIV class="col4" style="background-color:white;&gt; &lt;a href=" https:=""><P style="text-align:center; color:black; "><B>Figure 3:</B>Red ER1-cells viewed in confocal microscope in 2D </P></DIV><DIV class="col4" style="background-color:white;&gt;&lt;a href=" https:=""><P style="text-align:center; color:black; "><B>Figure 4:</B>Red ER1-cells viewed in confocal microscope in 3D </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col12-2" align="justify"><P>There is no indication that the red fluorescence is more concentrated in the periplasm, as we should expect due to the transport through the tat transport pathway.

We performed a excitation and emission scan of the ER1 bacterias together with <I>E-coli</I> strain ER2566 cells that were transformed to produce single RFP.

&lt;p style=" text-align:center=""><B>Pm/XylS promoter system</B></DIV><P>The Pm/xylS promoter was  modified (removing an XbaI site) and turned into a BioBrick by adding the prefix and suffix. With 3A assembly, the promoter was attached to a GFP generator (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E0240">BBa_E0240</A>), and a backbone (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:pSB3K3"> pSB3K3</A>). We tested the promoter and the reference promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20260"> BBa_I20260</A>) as done in <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=((Kelly%2C%20Jason%20R%5BAuthor%5D)%20AND%20Rubin%2C%20Adam%20J%5BAuthor%5D)%20AND%20Davis%2C%20Joseph%5BAuthor%5D"> this article</A>.
The reference promoter is BBa_J23101, which is a part of a constitutive promoter family. This promoter is one of the strongest in the family and will therefore produce a lot of GFP. The absorbance was measured at 600 nm, excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm. Background fluorescence was also determined by measuring only media and this measurement was substracted from the measurements of the samples. For the reference promoter, we measured every 30 min for five hours (see figure X). The Pm/xylS is positively regulated by m-toluic acid, so the samples were added different concentrations (0nM, 100nM, 1ÂµM, 10ÂµM, 100ÂµM, 1mM and 2mM) to see the effect. (figure X). The fluorescence and absorbance measurements were used to calculate the ratio of GFP synthesis.  The results show that the GFP are expressed in the samples with the Pm/xylS promoter, indicating that the promoter works. The figures below show the result from the testing. As expected, the reference promoter has a high rate of GFP synthesis. Even though the rate of GFP production in the Pm/xyls promoter is not consistent with the increasing inducer concentration, it still is producing GFP at a high rate. </P><DIV class="col6" style="background-color:white;&gt;&lt;a href=" https:=""><P style="text-align:center; color:black; "><B> Figure 18:</B> The ratio of GFP synthesis as a function of inducer concentration</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col6" style="background-color:white;&gt;&lt;a href=" https:=""><P style="text-align:center; color:black; "><B> Figure 19:</B> The ratio of GFP synthesis as a function of time</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
