Team:NTNU-Trondheim/18 June 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Started transforming BioBricks. Transformed some composite BioBricks consisting of constitutive promotor, RBS, a fluorescent protein and a terminator. Transformed the parts Promoter+RBS+RFP+term (<partinfo>BBa_I13521</partinfo>), Promoter+RBS+GFP+term (<partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo>), Promoter+RBS+CFP+term (<partinfo>BBa_I13600</partinfo>) and Pm+RBS+mCherry+term to competent E.coli DH5α cells, to have some colorful cells to show the camera crew from NRK (Norwegian broadcasting), who will visit our lab tomorrow :-)
For our transformation protocol, see the protocol page .
