Meet the team
This is the third year a team from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is participating in the iGEM competition. Our team consists of five students with background in Biotechnology, Molecular Medicine and Medical Technology. Mostly our collective background is in molecular biology colored with biophysics,  immunology and biotechnology. We have four advisors with different specialities! Rahmi is our lab-GOD and  has all the answers, Eivind gives us money and inspiration, Martin is our GFP-expert and Gunvor with her  past iGEM team experience has been a lot of help! We are naive students that want to come up with crazy ideas  that supervisors are too experienced to consider an opportunity. Our project this year is HIGH-risk and it was almost immediately clear to us that this was what we wanted to do this year. Considering the time-limit of iGEM it was an ambitious project and had everything gone as planned and expected we could have reached our goal. We believe the project has potential and should be further investigated. We've all enjoyed working as a team and learned tons about synthetic biology and the potential this field has feels unlimited! We have had a lot of fun, the life of a scientist is like a rollercoaster of ups and downs but the excitement and curiosity of research will always be a strong motivator!
