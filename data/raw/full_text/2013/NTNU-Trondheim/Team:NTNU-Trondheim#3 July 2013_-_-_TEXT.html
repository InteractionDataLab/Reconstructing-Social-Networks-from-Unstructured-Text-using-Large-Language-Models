The small-scale vesicle preparation continued with completion of step 2-7 in the vesicle isolation protocol. There where made three samples in step 2; E.coli ER2566 in LB, E.coli BW27784 in LB with ampenicillin (100 µg/mL) (ara-) and E.coli BW27784 in LB with ampenicillin (100 µg/mL) with the addition of arabinose (0.5 %) after 1 hour of incubtion (ara+).
Optical denisty (OD) at 600 nm was mesured as indicated in the table below.

We isolated the DNA from the transformed cells (with RBS, pBAD and pTet) by using the miniprep protocol and measured the concentration by NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer .
