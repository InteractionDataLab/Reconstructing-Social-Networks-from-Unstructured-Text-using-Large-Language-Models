Team:NTNU-Trondheim/2 July 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Tuesday 02.07.2013
This day we started making the small scale vesicle preparation according to our vesicle isolation protocol.
Overnight cell cultures of E.coli ER2566 and E.coli BW27784 transformed with the pUM9 plasmid were preprared. The pUM9 plasmid has amp^R induces a stress respons in E.coli when arabinose is present. According to the litterature (link?) stress in E.coli increases vesicle production.
The ER2566 cell were cultured in plain LB, while the BW27784 cells were cultured in LB with ampenicillin (100 µg/mL).
We transferred the samples of RBS, pBAD and the plasmid backbone (pTet) from agar plate to liquid medium and incubated at 37° C.
