Medal Criteria
BRONZE
✔ 1. Team registration
Registered Team
✔ 2. Complete Judging Form
✔ 3. Team Wiki
NTNU's Wiki Home
✔ 4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
✔ 5. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
We submitted two new characterized BioBrick Parts:
1. BBa_K1082002 is a Pm/xylS promoter system is positively regulated by m-toluic acid. The m-toluic acid binds to the xylS protein which is constitutively expressed by the Pm/xylS promoter system. The xylS-m-toluic acid complex binds to the Pm promoter, and activates it.
2. BBa_K1082001 is a composite part that constitutively expresses a tat-GFP-RFP construct. It is a protein coding sequence coding a fusion protein made up by GFP and RFP. In addition, the part contains tat, a signaling sequence responsible for transport to the periplasm.
SILVER
✔ 1.Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
BBa_K1082002 Pm/XylS: When tested, the Pm/XylS BioBrick expressed a high amount of GFP. This is a strong indication that the promoter works as expected.
✔ 2.Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
1. BBa_K1082002 is a Pm/xylS promoter system.
2. BBa_K1082001 is a tat-GFP-RFP construct.
✔ 3.Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
1.
BBa_K1082002
is a Pm/XylS promoter system.
2.
BBa_K1082001
is a tat-GFP-RFP construct.
✔ 4.Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
We have described the safety and implications that our project and experiments could have in concern to health and the environment on our safety page .
GOLD
✔ 1. Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
We believe that using engineered outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) within medicine as drug deliver vehicles is a novel and innovative technology. We defend that statement on our novel approach page .
