Tuesday 18.06.13
Started transforming BioBricks. Transformed some composite BioBricks consisting of constitutive promotor, RBS, a fluorescent protein and a terminator. Transformed the parts Promoter+RBS+RFP+term ( BBa_I13521 ), Promoter+RBS+GFP+term ( BBa_I13522 ),Promoter+RBS+CFP+term ( BBa_I13600 ) and Pm+RBS+mCherry+term to competent ''E.coli'' DH5α cells, to have some colorful cells to show the camera crew from NRK (Norwegian broadcasting), who will visit our lab tomorrow :-)  For our transformation protocol, see the protocol page .
Wednesday 19.06.13
We transformed BioBricks consisting of fluorescent proteins. Transformed the parts YFP ( BBa_E0030 ), CFP ( BBa_ I13600 ), RFP ( BBa_E1010 ), GFP ( BBa_E0040 ), BFP ( BBa_K592100 ) and SYFP ( BBa_K864100 ).
We transferred mCherry from agar plate to liquid medium and incubated at 37° C.
Thursday 20.06.13
We transferred the transformed cells from yesterday to liquid medium and incubated at 37°C ( protocol ).
We isolated the DNA from the transformed mCherry cells by using the miniprep protocol and measured the concentration by NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer .
