The WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team is incredibly grateful for the help and support of the following agencies and departments. We would also like to thank Dr. Erbe, Dr. Werner, Dr. Henkel for supporting us through personal research funds. We would also like to Thank Dr. Mundt, Dr. Phillips, and Dr. Farley for their help in protein kinetics, plant science, and anthropological studies respectively. Furthermore, without the help of the WLC administration, the Generac Hall staff, Dave Ross and MSOE students James Wiatr and Matthew Reichertz we would not have been able to put on such a successful camp. Finally, we would like to thank Vinoo, Kitwa and Kim for their help sending our team parts from the registry and their advice trouble shooting problems with our protocols and helping us obtain safe parts that were IRB approved.
