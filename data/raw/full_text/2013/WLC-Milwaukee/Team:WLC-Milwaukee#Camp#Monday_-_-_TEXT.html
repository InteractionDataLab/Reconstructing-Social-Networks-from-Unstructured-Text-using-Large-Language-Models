Monday
Monday kicked off the Synthetic Biology Summer camp. Students registered and immediately bonded with their new team mates. Team names were the Avengers, and team Madengwoo. We began the camp discussing where science and religion stand in our lives as Christians. This discussion as followed with excersizes on ethics, and different belief systems. Students took a tour of campus, ate lunch, and then entered the lab. They were welcomed by Kendalyn and Ashley, whom introduced them to basic lab safe pipetting skills. Time was not wasted, and they then extracted DNA from chick peas, followed by Gel Electrophoresis.
