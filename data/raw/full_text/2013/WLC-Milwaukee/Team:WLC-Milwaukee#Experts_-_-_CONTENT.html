in this particular field.</P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: My name is Ned Farley, I have a doctoral
degree in anthropology that is coupled with both a Masters and an undergraduate
degree in anthropology as well. In the Americas, anthropology is a program of
study that really breaks down into four main areas, one of which is culture.
Every trained anthropologist in North America has to have a methodological or a
working knowledge of being able to study culture and biology. My specific area
of licensure relates to archeology, so I deal with cultures that are deceased,
but the approach that I take when studying these cultures is one that is
ecological. I look at the impact of technology, and I look at things like
subsistence strategies, and really your study falls into those two camps. So
it’s something that I really relate with rather nicely. One of the courses I
teach here on campus is globalization, and kind of a core element, or central
element to that class and the curriculum of that class is this idea of
sustainability. Sustainability is kind of the new topic, and when I say new
it’s about ten years old but, it’s new for academics. It’s a new topic of
discussion because anthrologists always look at the past more than the future,
but what we have realized is that we cannot ignore one for the other. The past,
the present, the future, they are all intertwined into culture, and how people
use their culture, how they carry it, how they experience it. And so that, kind
of in a fast nutshell there, really sparked… was a cause in sparking my
interest in your proposal and the potential outcomes for that, because, and
I’ve even brought this up in my anthropology class, the idea of being able to
increase rates of sustainability with little to no overhead or capital
investment is exactly what humans have looked for since they started writing
things down on paper. When we take a look at, for instance, domestication, the
domestication of maize, eventually corn, allows people to live in urban
environments in the southwest. It is a means of survival; it allows them to
grow into large numbers and to flourish. However, with that said a lot of the
concerns that are being voiced right now by cultural anthropologists in the
field in places like, modern Ecuador, southern Columbia… these would be
geographical regions that would tie into what you are doing. Central Africa,
southern Africa, Thailand, southeast Asia – cultural anthropologists working in
these areas are starting to evaluate the impact that new technologies and
philosophies of new approaches towards indigenous sustainability… how those are
affecting cultures. And so when you came to me yesterday, I think your concern
was really great because even though it is not a direct laboratory concern, and
that is really where your energies have been spent right? Getting this off the
ground, getting this plane off the ground and now you are up in the air… the
question that you have to ask yourself is what the potential impact is for
this. So there is, in this case, two cultures that I think, current cultures
that I think you could look at, and then, there are a variety of cultures in rural
portions of Southeast Asia that will tie into this. Your impact is going to be
two-fold. First it is going to be market, so what is going to happen is if you
are going to introduce this probiotic to herders in a rural, developing
environment… they are going to become, and they already are I understand that,
but they will intensify. They will come in very close contact with the local
market place. Biologically, there have been studies that have verified that
increased market exposure, the health of the populations change, and change
negatively. Women and children, in places like Ecuador, have been studied,
things like the C-reactive proteins in the liver, in children, have been
studied, and they have found that these C-reactive proteins have increased
volumetrically with a more intense exposure to world markets. Basically it is a
round-about biochemical way of talking about the impact of infection disease.
So we see, biologically, and impact in infectious disease. How does this affect
the population, well okay, number one we see increases in mortality rates? We
also see an increase in sterility and a decrease in the reproductive fitness of
these populations, so you’re actually impacting fitness indirectly.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: Is that as a result of the change between individuals
who decide that they would rather work on their career, and being productive in
society rather than having children, or is it more as a result of a biological
decrease in sexual fitness.</P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: It’s a combination of both. The literature
right now is telling us that the attitudes of women will change; the attitudes
of mend will change in these developing environments as they are exposed more
and more to this world market affects. However, what a lot of the
anthropologists are coming to the conclusions that they are coming to is that
cultural attitude change is more just general exposure. These technologies
become conduits, pipelines, for contact between the west and the east right?
When you think about colonialism and the impact that it had on the health of
indigenous peoples here in North America…things like syphilis, tuberculosis,
the common cold, variations of flu, all of these are introduced, and introduced
in a very intensive way through contact, through market contact. A person would
say, “Wow, we are no longer living in the 16<SUP>th</SUP> century and 17<SUP>th</SUP>
centuries”, but in reality, you know how regionalism works, it’s still
prevalent. So one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that when you
equip people with new technologies they are going to maximize, they are going
to push in such a way that they will intensify the exposure to populations that
they are not generally running into on a regular basis, and it will impact individuals
who are most vulnerable, and this would be children. How can you get around
this first component I am sharing with you, because we will talk about this in
just a moment, and this is right up your ally, introducing some sort of
educational program that is geared not toward the sustainability technologies
that you’re discussing, but for healthy living. Things like washing hands,
right? Recognizing sickness, we are already teaching that to our young here,
and we have been. When I was a kid I remember getting a lecture on washing my
hands when I was in first grade, so that would have to accompany it. Men,
women, and children so that’s kind of the biological side of things, so you
don’t want to recreate the colonial times. The other thing is the culture, and
that is kind of the crux of why you came to see me today, so let me just speak
on that a little bit as well. When you are talking about herding, when you are
talking about the growth of rice, when you are talking about the growth of corn
– you are talking about cash crops. The first thing you have to ask yourself is,
“is this cash crop indigenous?” And the answer is going to be yes if you are
going to, let’s say Zambia, and you, because again Zambian cattle or central
Savannah African cattle, they’re the population that you’re going to hit so
they are indigenous to that area, and they are currently a cash crop. And
you’re affecting the viability of that cash crop right? You’re intensifying it.
Studies that have looked at similar types of technologies being introduced to
these regional cultures, specifically studies that look at forestation in
places like the Amazon, and that’s replanting included there. And then
accelerating that, with things like changing of the soil chemistry, or, in this
case, studies that have looked at increasing or decreasing the amount of space
that farmers need to raise a certain volumetric measurement of rice, or corn,
have resulted in, kind of some really interesting byproducts so I’ll tell you
about those, they kind of fall into two camps. We’re still dealing with culture
now. First, their perspective on natural resources. Cultures, the indigenous
natural resources that cultures are connected to and one of your colleges wrote
on the Masia. You know that these natural resources define them. They are not
just for food, they’re not just for mild, but they are literally part of their
culture. The Nuar in the Sudan are traditional agro pastoralists or herders,
they grow milk. When their herds are affected, rites of passage are affected. The
only way you can become a man in some of these cultures is to start your own
herd, and if you don’t have the chance to do that… because of competition,
because of warfare, whatever the case might be. It can literally have major
impact on your place in society. So you have to be cautious about that. What a
lot of the studies have found is that when new technologies, like your
probiotic, are introduced to indigenous environments, and cash crop
environments, there is a change in the attitude of people toward their
surroundings. They start to degrade and become extremely wasteful when they
approach all of their resources, and it has a domino effect. So, case and
point, I’m a pastoralist living in Zambia – I realize that I am, the population
is exploding, and their health is just wonderful, I do not have to worry about
any sort of gastrointestinal dysfunction or infections that they might receive,
because again you are going to help their health in a positive way. However, my
family and I may not treat them with as much respect as we once did, we might
treat them as just a commodity and then other aspects of our landscapes might
change. Our bamboo forest that is right next to where I am herding my cattle,
I’m going to clear cut it, because you know what? I’m going to herd more
cattle, and you’ve made this really profitable for me. So that’s the impact
that I am mentioning. What we see, in terms of the work of anthropologists is
that when you introduce cash crops you intensify, and this occurs a lot in
Thailand with rice farming? The terrace rice farming, when they start to really
produce a lot they don’t stop. Right? They don’t say, “Well that’s great, now
I’m getting a bigger crop out of what I have”. They go out and get more land,
they clear cut, and they plant more of their cash crop. See what I mean? It’s a
human desire, it’s a human goal. So what you would have to do is incorporate a
program, and you could mention this in your proposal. Incorporate a program
that would also train people, just like we are receiving training, on why you
shouldn’t liter, why you should respect the environment.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: So, would the American culture today be a good
reflection of what is happening, or could happen in these preindustrial or
developing nations.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: Very much. Well think about the dust bowl.
Same thing happening there.  They said, “Look at all this land we’ve got, let’s
get rid of all this switch grass and lets start planting!” and what happened?
They demineralized the soil so they made them very, very, in a sense sterile.
They had nothing, because they are of course harvesting the crop. They had
nothing, when those… and I think it was in the last summer months… when those
winds start to pick up with the storm seasons… mid-summer months. They had
nothing to hold the soil in place and so they had, literally intense erosion
happening and they had to move. If you want to start clear cutting, or start
changing, you know, these really important related, in this case, crops. So,
I’m not saying don’t do it, I’m just saying accompany it with some sort of
educational program that’s right in your wheelhouse, that’s what you did this
summer.</P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: When we look at the camp that we did this summer, we
were looking at GMO’s specifically: how they affected us, how prevalent they
are and, what their main purpose is. Insulin is a perfect example. Some people are
against GMO’s yet they don’t necessarily realize that insulin is a GMO. How
they define GMO is rather loosely they only characterized food products. Not,
anything else. So we addressed those particular issues.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: How to transform that vision?</P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: Yes exactly. So when we do that transformation and
remove that misconceptions how do we reach those who may not trust the science.
</P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: I can tell you right away one of the
techniques that has been studied by anthropologists, and they have found it to
be very, very useful, and you have probably seen, or even read material on this
before is training indigenous peoples to be the spokespeople. Giving them,
equipping them, and this is something that came up in your initial conversation
with me – creating a laboratory environment for them, and training them to
produce their own probiotics, right? Or to distribute if it’s going to be on a
higher level, a cooperate level. Make them the distribution, make it grass
roots, because when you come to me and say, you know, “I want you to try this
new food out”, let’s say. You went to a restaurant and you really loved it. And
let’s say it’s a restaurant, let’s say Portuguese, Portuguese restaurant. Well,
I got to say if you are coming to me and saying, “It’s really good I didn’t
have any problems”. I’ll accept that right away. There will be greater
authenticity there, greater credibility. But if someone from Portugal comes and
tells me, “hey you should eat there”, in a very thick accent, I might still be
leery. I might ask a few of my friends, “Hey have you gone over to that place?”
It’s the same kind of thing right? They want safety they want trust. So if it’s
like a colonial model, where a white guy shows up with a backpack and a great
idea, or where a government car shows up with AK-74s and guys in suits, I can guarantee
it’s not going to be as well received as if you have a person who grew up in
the village, you know, who has a herd, and who says, “Guess what I’m giving
this to my herd” because remember these animals are not just cash. You don’t
want to transform that. They are part of the culture, part of the society.
Right? Not as extreme as what we see in rural India for example, but it’s
pretty darn close to that. If I come up to you, and I say, “you know what I am
giving this to my herd. I am giving them this pill, and wow I’m tell you man,
they are growing heavier. They are healthier. I am not having to move them around
as much”, cause a lot of these guys move around a lot through the wet and dry
seasons. Especially in like central, eastern, and northereaster Africa. So I
can stay home, I have a better life. A person would say, “Wow, yeah, I’ll
introduce that to my heard as well.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: Are we worried though at all about creating a
sedentary society then, or more sedentary society than what was previously
there.</P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: That should be a concern, but  I think  what
we are going to find, in most places whether it is South America, MesoAmerica,
South Africa, the Eastern countries, in this case eastern Europe. People are
becoming sedentary anyway. This is a problem that we are having. There is less
land. People are losing access to cash crops and they are turning to labor. So
they are sitting on the land and they are walking to the local village or city
and the yare working at a factory and they are coming home. So I don’t think
that you have to worry about sedintism. There is very few nomads out there. The
nomads that are out there their herds are just so tiny to start with, if you
think of the nomads of places like Algeria, they are not your target group
anyway. Your target is, and maybe I’m making an assumption here, but your
target, in a sense, is the actual developing countries themselves, so not just
one tiny part of Thailand, but all of Thailand or all of Southeast Asia. I
think of it like a GNC, you are going to become like a GNC store for the globe.
If I want to increase my body mass, and I want to become more efficient with
regards to, lets say, working out in the field. Lets say I clear cut trees and
I want to be more burly, I want to be able to do this. I’ll go and choose to do
that. But I can also chose not to. So again you are not going to force people to
become sedentary, they will do that if they want to, and it is not a bad thing.
Sedentarism is just a natural byproduct of more production and surplus
production because that is what you are talking about here too. Now here’s, one
last thing here though, make sure that when you introduce or affect a cash crop
to a culture, to a village lets say. That they are not selling off all of their
potential food. Because one of the other things that we have seen, we have
seeing it since the early 1970s is we introduce a cash crop, we impact, or
share markets and then suddenly people are raising all this food, but they are
starving. And you are saying to yourself, “well how can you be starving if you
have a whole field of wheat, or a whole herd?”. This is because they can’t pay
their bills they have to sell everything off. What is awesome about your study
is that they could create enough surplus where they could feed themselves. So,
now it becomes indigenous again where I live off my herd, and sell it for cash.
Right? And that’s powerful. If you can do that without disturbing the balance
between biology and culture. You win, hands down.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: So this is a product that has the potential to make
and affect that balance?</P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: Yes, to bring traditional foods back into
the house, because you also don’t want people to make money and then go to 7/11
right? You want them to make money, but you also want them to grow their own
food, and eat their own food. You are also going to see things like domestic
violence go down because one of the things that has also been happening with
these cash situations is that suddenly people feel disenfranchise, and well,
what do they do? They take it out on the people that they love. I mean, we’ve
done that for centuries, unfortunately, so that is something to keep in mind.
Now there is one additional element  that I have to give you, as part of this
process. Now, if you’re on a timeline I apologize…. Okay. You want to make sure
you are not changing an indigounous or traditional brand of knowledge, and let
me explain what I mean by that. Think of your world view right? You might
describe yourself as Christian. You might describe yourself as Christian
Protestant… Christian Protestant Lutheran… however you want to. One of the
things that I don’t want to screw up in your childrens lives is any of that.
Because the assumption is that the knowledge that we have to impart to our
children should stay the same. It is part of our culture. The greatest
inculturator in your life in your mom. She taught you your culture, your
language, and everything else. You don’t want to destroy traditional ecological
knowledge right? You don’t want to transform it. The herd has to remain the
herd, and you don’t want to disassociate from it. Every mythological
characteristic, every linguistic characteristic, you know what I mean? You want
to make sure not to lose anything. It only takes one generation to lose a
language. It can take only one generation to lost a tradition, and you don’t’
want them to lose that, you don’t want your kids to go off to college and
become atheists. It’s the same thing, you don’t want this wonderful industrial,
agricultural element to damage that intimate relationship between parents and their
children.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Nick: With the rapid globalization, that we already have
occurring, isn’t it at this point that we should strive to preserve the culture
through history, through writing the document out, making sure that you gather
all that information, and then as the culture evolves and becomes more
homogenized, you know, a new culture form through these homogenization, we
still have the documentation.</P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">Dr. Ned Farley: Right, here is a good example. Your putting
together, working with Dr. Davis who is putting together an instrumentation
grant, and one of the things that we were asked by some of the people in the
community we wanted to partner with was, “well do you have to have a degree in
biochemistry to run this thing?” So, I sat down with Dr. Davis, and he said,
“No, that’s not why we are doing it. We’re doing it so there will be cues for
them to feel free to use this. That anybody can sit down, and at least they get
through the manuel, and its not a 5000 page manuel, but they can look through
it, and the can plug it in and use it, and get something out of the data.
That’s what you have to think about. So let me retrofit that idea. When you
create pamphlets, lets say you have a marketing campaign where you are sending
out fliers, or you are sending out pamphlets regarding this probiotic… don’t’
make it on your computer, and make it something that you would give to a CEO at
Generac. Make is something that has indigenous art, and has stories,
mythological stories of the cattle, of earth gods, and I’m not asking you to
paganistic in your approach, but what I’m saying is put the cues in there. You
know what I mean? Have every aspect of this technology, not replace what
parents are doing, but enhance it. I teach Sunday school, and one of the things
that I am doing with the kids there, cause they’re in 5<SUP>th</SUP> grade, is
were playing a role playing game. Now, I’m not playing D and D with them right?
That would be defeating the purpose, but I created game that is similar to it.
It contains some of the same strategies with the dice, but it has a Christian
theme. So when these kids come out of their kingdoms, they send messangers, and
these messangers go to cities, and they prostilitize. They are not fighting
demons, and gouls, and goblins. They are fighting bear. Or they are having to
jump over a stream, or something like this, and the reason that I am doing this
is that I am emphasizing the idea that you have to make it not conflict with
the culture, but works with the culture. Those knowledges, those histories are
not lot right? We cover ourselves in all types of stuff. I have seen the back
of your car. You’ve got stickers on everything. This creates a kind of
psychological piece, and it makes it intimate to you.  It is part of your
culture. Your making every object in your shirt, your watch, everything around
you is part of your tradition. If you can then incoorperate a pharmaceutical
and make it part of that. I think you win. And yeah you are going to fail more…
you know initially, but you test out some models, you know. You bring
indigenous people in and say, “How are we going to market this thing? You know
it works; I know it works. How do we get it out there, how do we get people
energiezed about it.” You want to check, and this is more of the business
world, there is a lot of business ethics resources that have been written on
solar panels, or well water. Well water in Africa, there is another good
example, the drilling of wells. This is done by indigenous peoples. It’s
created companies, indigenous companies you know? These are people that live in
villages. So that’s the way of getting around that concern. You will transform
the culture no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try not to, you are
always going to affect it; however, if our impact can be positive, you know, no
more clear cutting – the intensifying of that. When I’m introducing this. No
kids behind the school smoking cigarettes and getting tattoos and listening to
Motley Crew right? You want, I don’t know if people do that anymore… that what
we did, but you want people to celebrate who they are and say, “my herd is my
herd by-golly and its healthy and I live off it. It provides for my family, and
it provides cash for our family too.” So it’s a, unfortunately it becomes a
lifelong practice for you. You don’t just make the probiotic, introduce it, and
say, “Okay see you later”, right? Like some sort of comic book hero. You have
to live with these people, return to these people, but that’s the fun part of
it I think. </P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
