implications that arise from Wisconsin Lutheran College’s (WLC) 2013 iGEM
project. A customizable secretion pump provides endless research possibilities.
However, this project could also provide a probiotic that could add nutritional
value to the diets of developing countries who may not have ready access to
food sources. Food availability has a great contrast between developed and
underdeveloped countries; however, there are things to be considered when
developed countries aid those who are less developed. Sometimes this can result
in damage rather than repair. Culture of one’s society is something that ought
be protected. WLC’s 2013 iGEM project could have major future implications for
developing countries and would overall positively impact societies.</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">One of the great potential benefits
of this project is to provide impoverished people with more access to food. In
many less developed countries, survival lies solely upon crops and livestock.
“Often, poor people are trapped in a downward cycle as diminishing returns push
them to overexploit the land, causing further environmental deterioration and
poverty” (Dale). Their lives hang in a delicate balance that can easily be
disrupted by droughts and disease. “Globally, economic losses from diseased
livestock are estimated at $4 billion, and infectious diseases are responsible
for about 30% of animal deaths. In many sub-Saharan African countries, where
livestock production accounts for 25% of economic activity, these diseases
threaten livelihoods and food security” (Dale). In some scenarios, impoverished
people have populated urban communities. Even in a city, survival is a daily
struggle with no guarantees of success. This has led to urban agriculture (UA)
where people grow gardens on the rooftops in the city. This helps ensure proper
nutrition and food supply security. For these people, hoping to scrape by in
the city, urban agriculture is a lifeline, “increasing the food supply, raising
income levels, and protecting health — and at the same time improving
management of urban waste, water, and land” (Draper).   </P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">There are several distinguishing
traits for both developing and developed countries. Developing countries are
characterized by high birth rates, high rates of natural increase, high infant
mortality, high death rates, and minimal government aid programs. The birth
rate is high in part to compensate for the high infant mortality rate. This
high mortality rate is due to many contributing factors such as unsanitary
conditions, lack of medical care, and poor nutrition. The lack of nutrition in
developing countries has the added adverse consequence of increasing chronic
diseases. “Nutrition is coming to the fore as a major modifiable determinant of
chronic disease, with scientific evidence increasingly supporting the view that
alterations in diet have strong effects, both positive and negative, on health
throughout life” (Moynihan &amp; Petersen). Diet influences the development of
numerous diseases: obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dental,
and osteoporosis. However, “In many developing countries, food policies remain
focused only on undernutrition and are not addressing the prevention of chronic
disease” (Moynihan &amp; Petersen). In contrast, developed countries are
characterized by low birth rates, low death rates, established market
economies, and the presence of government aid programs. This is sustainable
because of the better living conditions and medical care the citizens can
access (“Differences between”). </P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">At times, the interaction of a
developed country with a developing country leads to the detriment of the
health of the region. For instance near the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR)
in Kenya, land use decisions are influenced by profits. Traditionally, the
Maasai people lived off of pastoral livestock herding supplemented by
small-scale cultivation to make ends meet. Since Western influence, some of the
Maasai have more land use options: receiving income from farming, wildlife
tourism campsites, farming associations, and leasing land for large-scale
cereal cultivation. It is preferred by some Westerners that the Massai avoid
the comparably lucrative leasing of land to large-scale cereal cultivation in
favor of small-scale cultivation, pastoralism, wildlife tourism campsites, and
farming associations. This is because the large-scale cereal cultivation is
detrimental to the wildlife of the region; it is estimated that 50% of the
wildlife population has disappeared in the last 20 years (Thompson &amp;
Homewood, 2002). The Massai can lease their land to large-scale mechanized
cereal farmers for an average of $2500 (Thompson &amp; Homewood, 2002). This is
significantly more than making $5.30 per acre on livestock, tourism campsites
which yield $520, small-scale cultivation, or the average $680 from being a
group ranch member (Thompson &amp; Homewood, 2002). Even though the Massai who
do not lease their land have more profitable land use options, many households
still devote 60.2% of their land to livestock and 37.8% to cultivation (Thompson
&amp; Homewood, 2002). The reasons for this involve cultural tradition, having
more self-reliance, and the fact that past experiences with these other methods
leaves little profit for the average Massai household. In other parts of the
world, companies take advantage of the less developed country. Coca-Cola, based
out of the United States of America, places some of their plants in India. In
one instance, irresponsible use of natural resources resulted in overuse of the
water supply in India and extensive pollution. Four dozen Indian villages were
put into water crises. The remaining water was unfit for agriculture,
livestock, and human consumption and caused severe illness in those who
consumed it. (Ravi Raman, 2007)</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">While the past has shown that some
scenarios where Western influence was not necessarily viewed as an asset, the
potential probiotic that WLC’s iGEM team could provide would increase
nutritional value of food. Food production, or increased efficiency, brings
numerous potential benefits to a society. Advantages due to food production
allow people to learn “to spin and weave; to make pottery, bricks, and arched
masonry; and to smelt and cast metals” (Kottak 2011). Advances in “sculpture,
mural art, writing systems, weights, measures, mathematics, and new forms of
political and social organization” have also been documented in the development
of the Middle East (Kottak 2011). Food production is often considered an evolutionary
advance due to the expansions that societies experience after food is no longer
the first concern.</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">There are numerous example of how
the presence, or lack thereof, of a food supply affects a nation and the
greater economy. The Irish potato famine in the 1840’s shows how an established
food source, once removed, significantly alters the economy and way of life of
the inhabitants. Potatoes were the dietary staple in the Irish diet and as was their
specialized export. Potato yields suddenly severely diminished for a few
consecutive years causing widespread starvation and hardship. It is estimated
that 1.1-1.5 million people died of starvation and related diseases in the
years 1845-1855 (Gribben). In addition, the niche that Ireland held in the
potato market was filled by other European nations. As a result, the Irish in
large part turned to livestock and pasture instead of potato farming. This greatly
altered their lifestyle and culture, including the music that they sang and
wrote, the amount of free time they had, as well as intensifying their concern
for charity and family. Currently there are developing countries in this state.
Nutrition and availability are great concerns in their society today, and some
developed countries have begun programs to support them.</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">There is a fear that developed countries
intervening will negatively impact the culture of those whom they are trying to
aid. Culture, although its value cannot truly be quantified, is of great
importance to society and to diversity of the world. The mentalities generated
from different cultures often lead to different responses to the same
situation. For example, the French and the Dutch both developed different
approaches to the treatment of the poor in their nations; the Dutch provided
for their poor, imagining themselves in the position of the poor, while the
French held their poor in suspicion and fear (Klamer). These different
reactions were due to different cultural mentalities. The intent of this
project is produce a product that would aid developing countries, without
necessarily changing their cultures, or “westernizing” them. However, one
virtue of culture is its adaptability and evolution over time. Some values and
customs persist for centuries, while others develop and morph frequently as
times change; this is healthy. Culture is not static, but dynamic. It is the
aim of this project to enhance the cultures that it touches.</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The nutritional gap between
developing and developed countries is apparent. Intervening in a developing
country’s lifestyle is not something to be taken lightly. Serious consideration
of the overall advantages and disadvantages is vitally important, as sometimes
this can result in great damage to their society, land, and ecosystems. As
WLC’s 2013 iGEM project would be a way to increase nutrition in a society without
directly changing their way of life, it has the potential for great worldly
benefit.  </P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">References</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">Dale, Stephen. <I>Innovation
