Friday
The final day began with Nicholas Goldner explaining the basics of stem cells. This was followed up with Dr. Balza's presentation of the applications of stem cells. The possibilities he presented were amazing, which made the students chattery the rest of the day. The DNA that had been PCR was then characterized, bringing yesterday's lab full circle. The students then returned to the first day of DNA isolation, but this time, they were isolating their own DNA, which they kept as a souvenir of their time at the Wisconsin Lutheran College Synthetic Biology Camp.
