Thursday
The students began their full day reviewing the materials learned on previous days and  engaging in a devotion which their teammates and group leaders. They then were introduced to the wonderful world of GMOs! Dr. Henkel began by enlightening the students on unique and unusual GMOs in the news and Dr. Phillips informed them about GMOs in industry. After lunch, the students were off to lab! They began by transforming pGLO into bacteria, which glowed under UV light! They finished their day by preforming the complex SDS-Page. Looking forward to the next day, the students were picked up and taken home.
