Tuesday
Tuesday began with a devotion and review from the last day. The students were fascinated while Dr. Erbe explained the process of the cell. Professor Moll then presented anatomy in a hands on and interactive way. In the afternoon, the students were introduced to basic microscopy and staining, and they even spotted a waterflea. The students got a better look at anatomy by dissecting a pig, and there was no hesitation. They were able to see the brain, bile from the gall bladder, and how the eye works. All in all, a day full of learning.
