modified organisms (GMOs) are received in different ways across the globe. Countries
have fabricated different legislation to react to the advances in the
healthcare industry and agriculture due to GMOs. The media in these countries
have brought the possible effects of GMOs to the attention of consumers. Thus,
many activist groups have formed for or against the use of GMOs. China, India,
Great Britain, Canada, the EU, and the USA have contrasting reactions to GMOs. </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><H3>China</H3><P class="MsoNormal">            China
is a nation whose population is growing rapidly. They must find a source for
food that is an alternate to importing food, as this becomes costly.
Biotechnology provides an answer; one that China is interested in pursuing.
They invested a significant amount of money, 3.9 billion US Dollars, in 2009.
(PDF SOURCE) in supporting research of this nature. “90% of China’s field
trials target pest and disease resistance in plants,” (Tao 2). Things such as
the sweet pepper, cotton, and tobacco are approved for use in China. 60% of
respondents to a survey conducted in 2006 were willing to purchase biotech
foods at the same price as their non-biotech counterparts. 20% would not accept
any sort of biotech foods, and 20% would purchase biotech foods if they came at
a discounted price. Another study published in “Food Policy,” suggests that
there are four perspectives in China, of which income plays a prominent role.
Those with the lowest income are more likely to buy GMO food sources, while the
group with the highest income are more concerned with the implications that
GMOs have for medicinal uses rather than a food source. (Zhang 6-7) Overall,
China has many uses for the potential that GMOs have to offer, however; they
are careful about what is allowed in their country. They look to the potential
that projects like “The One Ring to Secrete them All,” because the future of
feeding one fifth of the worlds population becomes a huge challenge as they
also face land that is degraded and urbanization. (“China’s ability,” 2013). </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><H3>United
States</H3><P class="MsoNormal">            The
United States tends to have fewer regulations on GMOs, in the respect of the
rest of the world. However, due to public awareness, regulations have become
heavier. At the beginning of these regulations, the United States had
difficulty deciding whether to regulate the process under which the products
were made, or the products themselves. “A
subsequent report from the National Research Council concluded that
&quot;the <I>product</I> of
genetic modification and selection constitutes the primary basis for decisions
and not the <I>process</I> by
which the product was obtained,&quot; and this became the basis for regulatory
American policy.&quot; (Lynch 6).  To see to the matter of regulation, the
European Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the
Food and Drug Administration work together to regulate these products. The
United States is known for its extensive research in biotechnology products.
The United States had 5,233 U.S. issued biotechnology patents, compared to the
299 of Britain and the 373 of Germany. (Jasanoff 2013). The United States uses
GMOs in their farming to reduce the amount of pesticides that they must use. </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><H3>The UK</H3><P class="MsoNormal">            In
comparison to the United States, Great Britain has placed stricter regulation
on GMOs. This is done in concern of harming either humans or the environment.
Much of the specifics of Great Britain’s base regulations can be found in the
Environmental Protection Act in 1990, which has been amended to fit current
events since. Movement has also been made to require labeling of all GMO
products, in order that the consumer can be aware. Currently, no GMO products
are being grown in the UK, but it is legal to import some GM products, such as
soy for use as animal feed. While they recognize the potential benefits that
GMOs may provide, they are more concerned about their effects. GMOs are
commonly rejected by the citizens in the UK as well, but that is improving.
“The new polling shows opposition has weakened, with 15.2% of 2,058 people
being &quot;fairly unconcerned&quot; now compared with 6% of 1,363 citizens in
2003” (“Public concern,” 2013). </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><H3>India</H3><P class="MsoNormal">            Throughout
their history, India has been weary of GMOs, but they have used Bt resistant
cotton. However, they have placed a moratorium on Bt cotton to explore the
possible detriments to using such products. (“The spread,” 2013)  The use of
GMOs has increased their export of cotton. “Economists Graham Brookes and Peter
Barfoot estimate that Bt-cotton boosted India's <A href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Economy">economy</A> by $9.4 billion from 2002
to 2010 and by $2.5 billion in 2010 alone”. (“Embracing GM,” 2013). Their
country consists of mainly small farms as their agricultural system, so some of
these farmers cannot handle the rising costs that accompany the use of GMOs.
Claims have been made of farmers committing suicide in correlation to the use
of GMOs (“Frontline/World,” 2013). In the past, GMO crops have helped India
develop, but they are taking a step back from the scene to observe what other
possible effects exist. </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><H3>Canada</H3><P class="MsoNormal">            Canada
is among the top five producers of GM products in the world (Ghoreishi 2013).
Their regulation is contrasting from other countries. GMO food products are
considered a “novel food,” and therefore; labeling is optional for companies.
Many Canadians show opposition to this, 88% of them have shown desire for
labeling of GMO foods. (Dobbin 2013). The majority, 60% (“Emerging
technologies,” 2006), of the population also believes that more studies need to
be done in order to verify the safety of GMO products. Ninety percent of the
canola oil produced by Canada is genetically modified, which contributes to
%15.4 billion dollars to the Canadian economy. (Ghoreishi 2013) </P><P class="MsoNormal"> </P><P class="MsoNormal">            Each
region of the world has a use and potential benefit gained from GMOs. However,
some regions are more accepting to GMOs than others. Canada and the United
States are among the most accepting of GMO products, while India and the UK
have many regulations and bans in place for GMOs. China has put a significant
amount into the research of GMOs; as their population grows, they face the need
for more basic resources. This project could have major implications for
developing and developed countries alike, even though populations have diverse
views on GMOs.</P><H3>References</H3><P class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:40.0pt;text-indent:-40.0pt;line-height:
