iGEM 2013
 
Description of our team
We are the 2013-iGEM team of the Sichuan University,Chengdu City. Most of us from the College of Life Sciences, one of the earliest departments founded in Sichuan University with a history of more than 80 years. This year, we work on imitations of sex differentiation, gametogenesis & sexual reproduction with E.coli.

Hi! I’m 3rd year undergraduate student in preclinical medicine. Although, I have previous experience in labs, iGEM is a new  and exciting place where I really feel the freedom of doing experiment.

Enjoying the happy and tired life in this  summer,I try my best to challenge myself and enrich myself . I realize that not every effort there is a harvest, but each time the harvest must be hard .So even I am a slow walker ,but I never walk back .

The discussion in the team always benefits me a lot, as a mathematics student learning the knowledge of synthetic biology through using modeling makes me feel very excited.

I am a junior at SCU-China majoring in Physics. I help with building models. For me, iGEM is an opportunity to experience modern biology. By participating in iGEM, I hope to learn more about science and technology. The knowledge I gained from iGEM will definitely influence my further research in physics.

Human Practice
Our IGEM team contrived and participated in the seminar about “ the Life of Arsenic(As) group" at the end of 2012.  In that seminar, we discussed a paper, " A Bacterium that Can Grow by Using Arsenic instead of Phosphorus", which talked about the relationship between As and lives on the earth. According to that paper, As may have potential ability to take place of phosphorus to comprise lives. The paper indeed gave some plausible reasons on the problem, though, we found that there were a few leaks in the author's conclusion because the experiment conducted by the author was unrepeatable and the results were not well-founded. Most importantly, there were a few papers undermining that paper. Of course, we didn't conduct experiments to testify hypothesis proposed by us. Consequently, we also can't draw a decisive conclusion. But through this seminar we learned that a good experimental design should be not only feasible but also reliable and repeatable.
At the beginning of 2013, we prepared a symposium about genetics. We aimed at making our new members familiar with the fundamental knowledge of genetics and broadening our horizons at the same time.
During this symposium, we discussed about the Mendel' laws. At first, we recollected the "First and Second Laws" of Mendel, then we elaborated the "Linkage Law" in detail. At the symposium we answered a few questions asked by new members and simultaneously, we had a more profound impression on genetics. In the end, we explained some common features and cognitive sites of restriction enzyme to make a preparation for our next experiment as a complement content. 
Besides, to enrich and broaden our kens we held some similar symposium about transgenic, signaling pathways, reparation of plant root and so on.
