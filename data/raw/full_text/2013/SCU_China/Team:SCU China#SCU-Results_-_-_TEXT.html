Result
Result 1 Test the function of Riboregulator
 
We assembled BBa_K1087004 with mRFP to create BBa_K1087015 , band we assembled BBa_K1087015 with RiboKey BBa_K145215 to create BBa_K1087021 .
BBa_K1087015    
BBa_K1087021    
Positive control   
 
Negative control:  BBa_J61046
 
We transformed BBa_K1087015 and BBa_K1087021 into E. coli DH5, respectively. And we used Ptet+mRFP1 (BBa_I13521) as positive control, irrelevant BBa_J61046 with no fluorescence gene as negative control.
 
All of the constructs were expressed in high copy plasmid PSB1X3.
The transformed cells were cultured in 37℃, 200rpm.
 
We used fluorescence microscope to observe the fluorescence at 16h, and we also used Thermo Varioskan Flash to quantitatively measure the fluorescence intensity at 16h, 18h, and 19h, respectively. 150ul culture fluid was added into each well of the 96-well black plate to measure the fluorescence intensity, and OD600 were measured using spectrophotometer at the same time one by one to quantify the concentration of bacteria.
Each sample had three duplicates when cultured. And the fluorescence value was handled through mathematical method. The fluorescence intensity of above transformants was divided by the OD600 value and minus that of negative control.
  Data  Qualitative representation of  Riboregulator 1, color change with time revealed the expression level  of corresponding parts.

PS: the fluorescence intensity of above transformants was divided by the OD600 value and minus that of negative control.
 
 
According to above figures, it’s obvious that the ribolock BBa_K1087004 worked well, and its fluorescence intensity was only 2.6531% compared to positive control even at 19h, while that of lock & key ( BBa_K1087021 ) was 91.7138% at 19h. The results suggested that the key BBa_K145215 could hugely improve the expression level of the lock BBa_K1087004.

Result 2 Test the function of the Riboregulator and PhiR73 activator together
 
We assembled PO promoter with mRFP1 to create BBa_K1087018 ，so that we can test the basal expression level of PO promoter.
We also assembled “TetR promoter + lock3d” with phiR73 activator to create BBa_K1087007 . Then, we assembly BBa_K1087007 with BBa_K1087018 to create BBa_K1087022 .
Finally, we assembled RiboKey BBa_K145215 with BBa_K1087022 to create BBa_K108702 3.

The transformed cells were cultured separately in the same condition and measured fluorescence intensity at same time.
 
 
The measurement was done mainly the same as result 1.

We could see clearly from above figures that the basal expression level of PO promoter was really low, and its strength could be improved about 11 times when induced by PhiR73 controlled by ribokey and lock.

Result 3 Test the function of Part BBa_K1087016 BBa_K1087016
 
Normally, we picked two colonies from the agar plate for BBa_K108701 6, called A and B. We transformed BBa_K108701 6A and B into E. coli DH5, respectively. And we use Ptet+mRFP1(BBa_I13521) as positive control, irrelevant BBa_J61046 with no fluorescence gene as negative control. The transformed cells were cultured separately in the same condition and measured fluorescence intensity at same time.

Blue: E. coli DH5αtransformed with BBa_K108701 6A.
Black: Positive control, E. coli DH5αtransformed with BBa_I13521.
Green: E. coli DH5αtransformed with BBa_K108701 6B.
PS: the fluorescence intensity of above transformants was divided by the OD600 value and minus that of negative control.
 
From above figures, we could conclude that the Ptet and mRFP1 in BBa_K108701 6 worked well. It was comparable to even stronger than the positive control BBa_I13521 in fluorescence intensity. For BBa_K108701 6A, it expressed about twice fluorescence of BBa_I13521. Results for sequencing suggested that the first half of the Ptet was lost in BBa_K108701 6A, which may account for its increase in strength.
