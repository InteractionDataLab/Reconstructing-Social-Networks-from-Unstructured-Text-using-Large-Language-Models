Achievements
1. We formed a very tuned team where we all enjoyed working with each other and had fun.
2. For our human practice part, we successfully took a great chance to propagate iGEM, our project as well as synthetic biology to advanced teenagers from all around the nation at China Adolescents Science and Technology Innovation Contest, which is a splendid gala for all brilliant teenagers in China to take part in and show their wisdom.
3. Our bacteria can effectively recognize the presence of atrazine.
4. For the biobrick measurement approach part, we successfully used HPLC to test the function of BBa_K1145001 and BBa_K1145002. The controls were set scientifically and the result was very satisfying.
5. We submitted 7standard biobrick parts with high quality and great performance.
6. We added a LVA-tag at the C-terminal of the primitive CI coding region. This tag will facilitate the turnover of CI in the cells.
7. For our model part, we have introduced the space lattice into our model to better describe the movement of bacteria and the distribution of micromolecule like AHL.
8. We successfully utilized the QS system to recruit more bacteria members to move towards atrazine to degrade it.
9. We collaborated a lot with team ZJU-China, and we offered TrzN, a gene can degrade atrazine to them, which may be of great help for their projects.
