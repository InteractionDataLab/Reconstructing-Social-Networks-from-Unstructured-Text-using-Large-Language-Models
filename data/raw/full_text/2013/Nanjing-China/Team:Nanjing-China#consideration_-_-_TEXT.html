Safety
Q1: If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what risks might arise? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
A: The strain we use is K12, which is not associated with diseases in healthy adult humans. However, if largely produced, they might affect the living situations of other creatures. For example, they might cause living competition on account of limited living resources. As to the second question, the methods we use in our project are quite common in Molecular Biology experiment, there will not be special risks arising.
Q2: Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
A: Yes, we have a system to make sure that the system we construct can only take effect and be inherited within our own strain. In other words, our system won't affect other living creatures in the environment.
Q3: Do your team members perform experiments under the guidelines of the Laboratory Biosafety Manual?
A: Yes, all of our member had read the manual carefully before we started to perform our experiments. Things like putting on gloves and wearing lab-gowns are strictly implemented in our lab. What's more, the atrazine solution which we left were all collected and treated with appropriated chemical solutions before they are released into the environment. And all the bacteria-related instruments were all sterilized before we threw them out.
