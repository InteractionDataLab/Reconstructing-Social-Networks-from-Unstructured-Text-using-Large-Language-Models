Overall project
Atrazine is one of the most heavily used herbicides worldwide, where it is used to control the growth of weeds. Atrazine is also a persistent environmental pollutant, and widespread contamination of groundwater has been reported in the United States. As such, there are increasing concerns over the toxicity of atazine in the environment.
Considering the fact that atrazine can hardly be degraded naturally in soil and water, we design and construct a system in E.coli to make them move torwards atrazine simultaneously up to the gradient and absorb it, degrade it into a harmless chemical substance.
At the same time, we also use the computer calculation to simulate the system we construct, hoping to endow our system with high stability.
