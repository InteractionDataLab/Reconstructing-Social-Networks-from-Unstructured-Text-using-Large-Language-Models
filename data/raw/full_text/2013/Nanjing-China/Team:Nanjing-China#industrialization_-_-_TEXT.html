Outlook
Synthetic biology is the third evolution in life sciences. We constructed a group of automatic bacteria with synthetic biology, artificially controlled their motility and equipped them with the ability to efficiently degrade harmful herbicide, atrazine.
For the last two months, we primarily proved the bacteria's ability to recognize, degrade and move. We also used computers to simulate our design, and finally located on the best system.
We know exactly that our work still has a long way to go to get near to industrialization and commercialization, but we do believe that this hope can be eventually realized. Just think about the fascinating progress from the first computer to the PC, iPad and iPhone today, our research perhaps is still lingering in the "old times", but we have enough confidence that it will shock the world one day, providing us with a final answer to the pollution of atrazine.
