Attributions
Here we acknowledge that all the work done in this project, including laboratory work, website design, and data analysis, were done by the Northwestern University 2013 iGEM Team. We thank Dr. John Mordacq, one of our advisors, for letting us utilize his lab space for the duration of the summer and providing us with any necessary materials that we may have lacked. We also want to thank Dr. Josh Leonard, Dr. Keith Tyo, and Dr. Michael Jewett for advising us throughout the process. We would like to thank our Teaching Assistant Jessica Perez  and Biology Lab Tech Lukas Streich for teaching us numerous protocols and lab practices. The Jewett lab also donated the parts Lpp-RBS and Taq-RBS used in our Dual State Construct. Lastly we would like to thank the 2010 Wisconsin-Madison iGEM team for their gadA promoter sequence.
