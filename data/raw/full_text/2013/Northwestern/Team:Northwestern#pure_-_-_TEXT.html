PCR Purification
We used the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen.
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR sample and mix. Apply sample to a spin column and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.
Discard flow-through.
Place the column back into the same tube.
Wash with 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30-60 seconds.
Discard flow-through and place the column back into the same tube.
Dry spin for an additional 1 minute at 13,000 rpm.
Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 uL of nuclease free water to the center of the membrane.
Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge the column  at 13,000 rpm for one minute to elute.
Store at -20°C.
