        </P><P class="des">Nirmal is junior double majoring in Biology and Economics at Northwestern University. Prior to iGEM, Nirmal had research experience in Psychology. Nirmal’s science interests developed greatly after entering Northwestern where he was exposed to Molecular Cell Biology and Synthetic Biology greatly.  In his free time, Nirmal enjoys spending time with friends and playing sports.
    </P></DIV><DIV class="personal"><P class="name">Samson Fong
        </P><P class="des"> Samson is a junior studying chemical engineering, minoring in biotechnology and biochemistry. He is still undecided about his future career, ranging anywhere from engineering to research to medical school (or a combination of the three). In addition to iGEM, he has worked in Professor Schatz’s lab working to model DNA bending around nucleosomes. Samson also enjoys playing piano and clarinet for fun. Occasionally, one can find him taking pictures of mundane objects, trying to pass it off as art.
