PCR Amplification
To a small PCR tube (on ice) add:
enough water to fill to 50 ul (19 uL)
1 ul of template DNA
2.5 ul each of 10  uM forward and reverse primers
25 ul of PCR Master Mix
Quickly transfer PCR tubes from ice to a preheated thermocycler with the following conditions:
initial denaturation: 94°C for 30 seconds
25-35 cycles: 94°C for 15-30 seconds (we did 30 sec)
45-68°C for 15-60 seconds (we did 60°C for 30 sec)
68°C for 1min/kb (we did 2 min)
final extension: 68°C for 5 min
hold: 4°C for as long as necessary
NOTE: For colony PCR just add a single colony using a pipette tip as the last thing you add to the solution instead of the template DNA. Twirl the colony into the solution in the tube and then proceed as usual
