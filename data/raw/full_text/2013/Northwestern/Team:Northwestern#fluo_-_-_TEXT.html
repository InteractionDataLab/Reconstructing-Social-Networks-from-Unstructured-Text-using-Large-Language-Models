Fluorescence Assay
Grow an overnight culture in M9 Media
Aliquot 5 mL M9 media into an overnight tube
Add Antibiotics (5uL Amp 100)
Inoculate desired strain
Incubate and shake at 200rpm, 37 C
Grow the overnight culture in exponential phase
Aliquot 5 mL M9 media into an overnight tube
Add Antibiotics
Add 50 uL of overnight culture (shake gently to mix the cells that may have pelleted) into fresh media
Incubate and shake at 200 rpm, 37C
After 3 hours, test OD with cuvettes to check for exponential growth (usually around 0.3)
In 15 min intervals, check OD to make sure cells are in exponential phase
Prepare plate (should be done during the incubation time for growing exponential cells)
Add 175 uL of desired media (if testing with pH media, add it now)
Record which well contains what media
Make sure to work in triplicates
Plating exponential cells
Add 1 uL of exponential cell culture into desired well
Place in plate reader and test for both absorbance 600 and fluorescence 485
Test for 16 hours (time can be adjusted)
