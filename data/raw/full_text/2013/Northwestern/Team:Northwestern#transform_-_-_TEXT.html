Prepare Required Solutions
SOB
Sterile Water
Prepare Lab for Procedure
Turn on water bath to 42C
Get Bucket of Ice
Get DNA Plasmids
Thaw Required Solutions
Thaw the competent cells on ice   (Bring bucket of ice to the -80C for this part)
Put overnight tubes on ice (# overnight tubes = # transformations)
Prepare DNA
From iGEM Wells
Add 10uL of Nuclease-free water into well
Pipette up and down several times to mix
Let sit for a few minutes
From AMP Resistance Stocks
Aliquot 1uL of DNA from stock tube into a different microcentrifuge tube
Put DNA stock tube back into freezer
Add 99uL of sterile water into microcentrifuge tube (concentration 1:100)
Aliquot 1uL of the new mix into a second microcentrifuge tube
Add 9uL of sterile water into second microcentrifuge tube (concentration 1ng/ul)
Let DNA sit on ice for 5 minutes after resuspending
Tips: When inserting DNA, put DNA into the solution, and leave the tip in it
Prepare Overnight Tubes (start from here if using hydrated DNA)
Take 25uL aliquots of cells into the overnight tubes on ice
Add 1uL of DNA to each overnight tube on ice
Inject the DNA into the solution at the bottom
Leave tip in the overnight tube
Let sit for 30 minutes on ice
Heat Shock the Tubes in the Water Bath
Place the tubes in the water bath (42C) for exactly 40 seconds
Place immediately back on ice for 2 minutes
Add 200uL of SOB to each tube
Place into shaker (200rpm @ 37C) for 1 hour
Preparing Plates
Spread cells onto plates
Incubate overnight in the incubator (37C)
Making an Overnight Culture
Take 5mL LB and put in a round bottom 5mL tube.
Add 5 μl antibiotic (100x) to the tube.
Take a p200 Tip and lightly touch a colony.
Eject the tip into the culture and put the cap on (not completely).
Grow overnight for 12-16 hours.
Left over overnight cultures (after mini prepping) can be used to make glycerol
