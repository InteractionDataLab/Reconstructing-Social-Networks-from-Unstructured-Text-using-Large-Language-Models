Modelling
The final aim of our project involves population dynamics between Skully coli and H. pylori. Modelling the basic interactions in this system is very useful in a first instance to calibrate the induction of our system. This balance is crucial in our dynamic. Since we intend to produce an antimicrobial peptide in vivo and we are using a peptide that is inherently toxic to the host, we need to be able to calibrate the production of the peptide and the efficiency of the resistance in order to have a working system.  The model is based on differential equations describing the population of Skully coli Sand of Helicobacter pylori Has well as the production of the antimicrobial peptide P.
Please check our Modelling section to see the detailed model.
