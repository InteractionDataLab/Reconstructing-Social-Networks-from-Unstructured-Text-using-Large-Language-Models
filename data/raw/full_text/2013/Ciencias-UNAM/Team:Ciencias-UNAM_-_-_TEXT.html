ACHIEVEMENTS
This year's project is an In vivo production of an antimicrobial peptide regulated by quorum sensing. We designed a synthetic system in E. coli to express an antimicrobial peptide (Cathelicidin LL-37) in vivo only in the presence of a quorum sensing molecule (AI-2) and expel it with an efflux pump in order to act against targeted gastrointestinal pathogens.
We are the team from Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM in Mexico City. Our team brings together students and teachers from all over the country, with various backgrounds and interests.
We submitted several devices mainly to test and use the following parts:
Cathelicidin LL-37: An antimicrobial peptide against bacterial infection.
MarA: A peptide responsible for an efflux pump in E. coli that is related to its resistance to cathelicidin and similar peptides.
The project we developed this year yielded several results. We achieved to characterise  and contribute to the iGEM Registry. In this section we present what we think we are our best and main results.
