Radio Interview
In order to spread and transmit information about Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and this year’s project we managed to obtain a radio interview in one of Mexico’s most important cultural radio stations, Radio Educación. Currently, Radio Educación is a decentralized body of the Ministry of Education (in its origins it was not), coordinated by the National Council for Culture and the Arts, whose substantive work is to develop and disseminate educational expressions, culture and art of Mexico through the radio. It is the first educational and cultural broadcasting in Mexico. It transmits in the entire Mexico republic, Central American and in south of the United States, making programs reachable to huge audiences.
In the past nine decades, Radio Education has been an institution generating radio forefront of providing innovative proposals in radio programming and formats, as well as the promotion of cultural initiatives.

With this interview, placed on the 19 year old news program “Su casa y otros viajes”, we were able to popularize and make this cientific knowledge accessible to the general public, that is, we made an effort to lead scientific knowledge to those interested in the understanding or learning of such knowledge.
