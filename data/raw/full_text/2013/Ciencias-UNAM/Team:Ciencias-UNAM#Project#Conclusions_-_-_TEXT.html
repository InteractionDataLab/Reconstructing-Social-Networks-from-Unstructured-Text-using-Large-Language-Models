Conclusions
Our experiments focused on the measurements of the expected phenotypes, which in our case, involve the increase or decrease of viability or inhibition. To measure the experiment in this way is relevant, since the expected function of the part is a phenotype. Although measuring via reporters is useful to infere the production of a certain protein, the cuatitiative measure of the effect is more relevant in parts like ours. The designed experiments allow to use two variables (in this case the induction with IPTG and the concentration of antibiotic) and to show not only the characterization of a promoter (as it is often done) but also a cuantitative measure of the desired phenotype.
MarA Showed to increase the sensibility to Tetracyclin.
Since the plasmid in which the part is transformed uses the Cloramphenicol resistance, it is possible that due to the similar action mechanism they both use, causes an hypersensitivity. Still, MarA showed providing resistance to Kanamycin. This is clearly shown in the graphs in the results section.
