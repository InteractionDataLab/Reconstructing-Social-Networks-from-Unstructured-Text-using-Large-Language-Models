Future Work
Researching about AI-2, we realize that there has been activity of this quorum-sensing molecule in other pathogenic bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, such as S. typhimurium, S. aeruginosa, E. coli or V. cholerae, so it seems feasible construction also against these bacteria. It is also important to verify if the model can help us with the design of new experiments, specially with the calculation of different concentrations of antibiotics, inducers, etc.
 
We are also currently working on the implementation of this system on an eucaryotic organism. We think this would solve the problems with the codon adaptation work performed on the sequence to get it produced on an procaryotic chasis.
