Presentation at High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University
             Although iGEM has High School Division, few high school students know about iGEM and synthetic biology. In order to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology among high school students in Nanjing and encourage more high school students to participate in iGEM, we went to High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University(NSFZ) to introduce iGEM, synthetic biology and our project in the form of presentation and poster.  Beginning with the three industrial revolution, we focused on the upcoming forth industrial revolution, which is a new era of systems biology and synthetic biology, and talked about Craig Venter's synthetic life, genetic engineering etc.
            Then we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM, delivering the idea of synthesis, engineering and standardization. Besides, we talked about the rapid development of iGEM, especially that in China.
            At last, we introduced our project.Many students showed great interest in iGEM. We hope that what we did could inspire much more students to participate in iGEM and enjoy it!
Sina Weibo---iGEMer-China
            Sina Weibo is a microblogging site in China like Twitter in the US. It is one of the most popular sites in China. Sina Weibo has over 400 million users, including movie stars, singers, famous business and media figures, athletes, scholars, artists, organizations, religious figures, government departments and officials from all over the world.
            Because of the huge influence of Sina Weibo, we started an account called iGEMer-China to popularize iGEM through Internet.
