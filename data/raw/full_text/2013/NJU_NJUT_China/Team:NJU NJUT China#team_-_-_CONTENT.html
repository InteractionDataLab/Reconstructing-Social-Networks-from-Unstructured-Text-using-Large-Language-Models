When I am not in the lab, I always enjoy myself by learning physics.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="post"><DIV id="cont"><P>Cao Zhe, I’m a junior from Nanjing University majoring in Life Sciences. Like most guys in 20s, I’m a big fan of sports, movie and computer games. Also like most guys around at the similar age, I’m still perplexed about my future plan. To be rough, I’m fancy with the basic cellular signal and transduction, which related closely to the synthetic biology. In our team, my job is to coordinate the experiment, research, financing and presentation affairs. Considering the purpose when taking part in this contest, always, the essence of discovery gives us the priority. We might pursue after different directions after all of this, but the 10-month journey for the iGEM can always be inspiring and referential when starting our long or short, but always tough research career.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="post"><DIV><DIV id="cont"><P>This is Lin Lei, a junior from Nanjing University majoring in Life Sciences. He is interested in electrochemistry and biomedical engineering research. Impressed by the mechanism of CRISPER system, he decided to join the team.  Outside the lab, he is a heavy soccer fan.

My job in the team is helping doing some experiments and conducting public diplomacy programs.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="post"><DIV><DIV id="cont"><P>Yunyun He, I am a year 3 undergraduate in school of life sciences, NJU. To be honest, I had few lab experiences before this project. However, as a initial member of out team, I forced myself to swallow bunches of new knowledge, new information and new technology throughout the past few months. As the superintendent for a time, I learnt how to arrange our lab time to ensure efficiency and how to design detailed experiment to test an idea or to find out why it didn’t work. All of these experiences will be of great help in my study life later. I like basketball, and I also would like to work out in the gym. Besides, I am a super fun of cycling. I would like to enjoy my leisure time in a healthy way.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="post"><DIV><DIV id="cont"><P>I'm Ning Meng, 20 years old, a junior student of Nanjing University, majoring Life Science.
