            experiment
    All cellular systems evolve ways to combat predators and genomic parasites. In bacteria and archaea, numerous resistance mechanisms have been developed against phage.
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) adaptive immune systems are found in bacteria and archaea to protect the hosts against the invasion of viruses and plasmids. Most of the bacteria and archaea acquire virus resistance by integrating short viral nucleotide acid fragments into the CRISPR sequences.....

Combing the outstanding students from Nanjing University and Nanjing University of Technology, we are trying to make the CRISPR/Cas systems work in the eukaryote cell with the help of the synthetic biology methods. Furthermore, considering the spacers’ sequence as the result of evolution, our team is developing a highly-probable algorithm to direct the synthesis and seeking of spacers or proto-spacers.
