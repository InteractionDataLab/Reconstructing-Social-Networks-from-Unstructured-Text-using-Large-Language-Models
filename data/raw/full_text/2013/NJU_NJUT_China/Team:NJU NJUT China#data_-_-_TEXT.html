DATA
(A)Schematic diagram of Cas9/RNA-mediated gene targeting.
(B)Schematic representation of EGFP-A chimeric RNA (chiRNA) binding to pEGFP-N1 plasmid through spacer sequence.
    Shen B, Zhang J, Wu H, et al. Generation of gene-modified mice via Cas9/ RNA mediated gene targeting[J]. Cell research, 2013.)
Data for Our Favorite New Parts:
1. BBa_K1160000 -coding sequence of Cas9(from Type II CRISPR system):
  The coding sequence of cas9 derived from Streptococcus pyogenes ( UniProtKB AC Num.:Q99ZW2 ), guided by crRNA and tracrRNA to complete its specific DNA cleavage function
2. BBa_K1160001 - chimeric RNA:
  Combining crRNA and tracrRNA, designed to target the BBa_K1160002 part. Flanked by BsaA I site, which is replaceable for the desired editing sequence.
3. BBa_K1160002 - cas9 cleavage detector:
  Contains an EGFP coding sequence and a crRNA targeting sequence, used to detect the specificity of cleavage activity conducted by Cas9 ( BBa_K1160000 ) and chimeric RNA ( BBa_K1160001 )
Data for Our Favorite New Parts:
1.  BBa_E2020 - enhanced version of ECFP, yeast-optimized
2.  BBa_E2030 - enhanced version of EYFP, yeast-optimized
