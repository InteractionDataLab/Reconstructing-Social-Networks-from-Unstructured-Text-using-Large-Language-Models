Hello everyone;
I’m Selin. I am graduated from METU Biology department this year and I will become a master student in METU Biology department. I am part of the METU 2013 Team because I really enjoyed in METU iGEM 2012 team. This year, being a part of the team means different than previous year because I have more responsibility as team leader. I believe every good and valuable thing is not gathered easily. This motto and our team give me power not only making good things which based on synthetic biology but also running the team :) I am really proud of a member of this wonderful and mischievous team :)
 
Hi, I am Batuhan Elcin and i am a junior student in the department of biology,and its my first year in the iGem competition. I am also a huge fan of Sci-Fi literature. Participating in iGem project makes me feel like a mad scientist in those stories. But they call me the tech-guy in laboratory referring to my knack for machines. For further questions message directly to me via steam/linoinsenger.
 
Hi, I am Alisan Kayabölen. I graduated from Molecular Biology and Genetics department. It is my second year at master study in Biomedical Engineering, METU. I was in iGEM team of METU last year, and before that team I couldn’t do anything at “genetics” side of my own department. I studied on stem cells and tissue engineering fields during my internship and special project course. So, iGEM was a huge chance for me to study genetics and learn many techniques about synthetic biology. My dream is to be able to combine tissue engineering and synthetic biology fields. I have worked mainly in theoretical planning of project and at wet lab part. And, I also tried to find sponsors for our project, but it is difficult to say that I was very successful.
Hey! I’m Bilge, a soon to be sophomore in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department of METU. Though participating iGEM was not that hard for me, I wanted to contribute to science and I wanted to do it with my friends, but understanding and learning all the things was not easy at all. Yet, here I am, trying to do my best for our project. I always loved the idea of working in a lab but what I didn’t know was that I would fall in love with it. iGEM taught me lots of things, what I want to do in future, what I don’t want to do in future, what it takes being a part of a wonderful team and dedicating yourself to something and that you have to learn new things every day if it is an area like ours- recently developing and just a small part of it is discovered. But the most important thing iGEM taught me is that there are no boundaries when it comes to science. If your imagination is wide enough nothing is impossible!
Ahoy, my fellow iGEMers.
Me name be Özgün Kırdar, a sophomore student at METU Biology. This is my second year in iGEM and I really happy to join this again. We learn so much about synthetic biology and iGEM at last year, and this year we use this experience for not to repeat our same mistakes and hopefully gain a gold medal. This year I help my team at Funding(Again, ahh!), Project Design, Wet Lab and Human Practice( I’m a movie star, Arr!).
Synthetic Biology is what I want to study and thank you iGEM for helping me to realize that and giving me a really good opportunity.
See ye later.
 
 
Hello everyone;
I am Aykal Refik Aşkın and I will be a junior student in the Department of Statistics in METU. I am one of the non-biologist student in METU iGEM 2013. This is my first iGEM experience and I am very excited. Thanks to Gürkan I met iGEM. I am a member of the modelling part. I think iGEM will develop me. I learn taking responsibility and teamwork. I am very happy to being this wonderful team.
 
 
Hi,
I’m Oğuz, it is my second year in iGEM now. Long story short, I love synthetic biology! I love being in a lab, I love presenting a new area and fascinating people while I explain what I do in my free time. Let’s be honest, iGEM is (!) the most time consuming and energy draining thing on Earth. But and that but is important, the feeling of accomplishing something is so fulfilling, iGEM work and the Jamboree’s are so much fun that you cannot let it go anymore.
 
See you all again next year folks, until then lets have a blast of a time in both the lab work and during the jamboree!
 
 
Hi, I am Aysegul Dede.
I am a third year student at Biology Department of METU. I am the newest member of the team , i am generally called as ‘Hey intern’. Although I joined the team afterwards, all members gave me a huge hug and they encouraged me to catch up their knowledge level. I joined the team since I’ve always wanted to solve both environmental and humanity problems via biology. Thanks to IGEM, I have lab experiences which help me not only in my courses but also will help me in my future studies. IGEM helps me to fulfill my dreams.
Hi !
I’m Mehmet Nizamoğlu from METU iGEM 2013 Team, second year Molecular Biology and Genetics student at METU. Although it was hard to decide to take part in this competition team and it took hours to be convinced, right now I’m in almost every part in our team: Human Practice, Wet-Lab, Funding and whatever left. I’m in because iGEM is a perfect opportunity to take responsibility and expand your knowledge by yourself. While working on this project, you are nearly on your own, nobody to ask, nobody to blame and nobody to save you. You learn to learn, so your friends can ask you, you learn to take responsibility, so you friends can blame you and you learn to act without a command, so you can save time and what needs to be saved. That is the soul for iGEM, and I believe I have it – so here I am.
Hello people! =^o t o^=
I’m Uğurcan SAKIZLI and they call me “ghu” which is my nickname on the internet. I am a sophomore in Biology Department of METU and I was –fortunately- dragged into the iGEM team by İlkem. So, this is my first iGEM experience. I believe what I learn here will become useful in my future education and life. I like working in the wet lab but I’m mainly participating in the modeling team. Yarışmacı arkadaşlara başarılar diliyorum.
Hi, I am a senior in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in Middle East Technical University. I have also a minor program in Logic and Philosophy of Science in the department of Philosophy. This is my second year in IGEM. I learned lots of things that i could not even imagine last year and. I expect nothing less from this year. We are more experienced now and we have many talented newcomers this year. This competition is a great opportunity to understand synthetic biology as a discipline and and funniest way to doing science.
Hi I am Gürkan Akan, a third year student in Statistics Department in METU. This year is my first iGEM experience and I think I will be in next iGEM teams of METU. I met IGEM very spotaneously and I really loved the idea. Modifyng some creature for your own purposes, it sounds like the bad guys in animes. Sadly, this year I could only contributed the modelling part of it but I hope on the next championships I will be able to help the wet lab too. This project need too much effort and it makes our team like our family and I am very happy to being with my team.
I' m Hakan TAŞKIRAN, a third year student at  the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU. This is my first year in iGEM and at the beginning I wanted to contribute my team in the lab work but now I' m the designer, scenarist, director, and party organizer of our team. I do not complain about my job because I think it is the best part of the iGEM competition. I see iGEM as a tool to reach the people who don't know what science really is and how fun it can be. Also, iGEM gives us an opportunity to do eco-friendly science and make our earth a little bit better place to live. with my team what they did and want to do i hope people will understand the purpose of science and scientist and they will be more open to science and become more aware about our environment.
Hello dear iGEMers,
 it's Ilkem Kumru here. I am a sophomore student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my first year in iGEM. I take part in Wet Lab, Human Practice, Modeling and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death, and it is also the only place where I feel myself as immortal as my love of science.
Hello everyone!
I’m Irmak a freshman from Environmental Engineering in METU. Also I’m working on granule sludge in microbiology laboratory as an assistant in my department . This is my first year in iGEM team as a wetlab worker and as a director of the videos for our human practice works and also researcher for improving projects. Although I’m studying engineer , I’ve always been interested in biology and last year I've heard about the synthetic biology which is very interesting for me. So, I’m here  and so happy to be here. Dealing with the serious problems in the world, and trying to solve them, learning new things every single day and applying them into academic life by leading our wise seniors... This is how we are in our team, and this is what I want to do in my life always.
 
 
Greetings; I’m Emre and I will be a junior student in the Department of Biology. This is my second year in this competition. I mostly work on the wet-lab but I help my friends in most fields as far as in me lain. In my first year, I gain a lot of experience both in theory and in practice. This time my prior aim is share these experiences with my new teammates since iGEM marathon is exhausting and we need fresh blood during the lab session and when the deadline comes closer. I love working on synthetic biology since iGEM gave me this opportunity and I love being a part of iGEM.
Heyy ; I am Burak KIZIL , a first year student at Biology Department in METU.Mostly the name of competition attracts me, to be participated in İnternational action , combining the concepts of Genetic and the Engineering and creating the Machine.I am really happy to be part of İGEM, since its like surviving in the endless field by the guide of team spirit and devotions. à bientôt en France..
I am Buse Isbilir , a forth year student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU and also in Computer Engineering minor program. This year is my second iGEM experience and I think I will be in next iGEM teams of METU. I am happy to be a part of iGEM, because in this competition you are the captain of your ship. My crew and I worked a lot for the modelling and wiki. This sense of freedom is just our thing.
Hi! I am Muge from Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at METU. This is my first year in METU iGEM Team. I am a member of this team because I like working in the lab, making something with our own study. As METU iGEM Team 2013 we’re all working hard for the project and the other things and also we have great friendships with all the nervous things in the lab. I am really happy to be part of this team.
Hi, I'm Samet Albayrak, a senior student at Molecular Biology and Genetics department in METU. Being in iGEM team requires huge amount of dedication and lots of hard work. But in the end I hope it will pay off. I always wanted to make a difference and change something in the world. With the almost endless energy I have, if used properly, I think I can do that. I also love working in lab. I even love my lab coat, thinking about giving a name to it :) And here's iGEM, the best and the most fun opportunity to do everything i want I've ever came across.
Hi everyone!
I’m Şeniz Yüksel and that is my first year in METU iGEM Team. I’m studying Biology at the Middle East Technical University. I am having my first iGEM experiences and I can say that I really enjoy the work during our project. The best part I like to spend time is the work in the lab. In iGEM I can find an opportunity to develop our ideas and to be a part of science. Through the processes we are doing I learned a lot of things and now I have a greater vision of synthetic biology. I think iGEM is a perfect way to improve my knowledge. We are all working and giving our best for our project. I enjoy being a part of iGEM.
Hi everyone.
My name is Begüm Ece Tohumcu, a freshmen student in Biology. I’m part of the this year’s METU iGEM Team and this is my first year at iGEM competition. I’m really excited about it. I join the team because I want to get new experiences about biology and this team is really great way for me to learn about synthetic biology. Working at real-time lab is really teaching me, a freshmen student a lot. I am also an eco-girl, and doing a project about saving the environment is just what I want to do. I help to team at lab works and human practice (I’m the Queen Bee, Yey!). I’m really looking forward to come to the Lyon for competition. See you soon.
