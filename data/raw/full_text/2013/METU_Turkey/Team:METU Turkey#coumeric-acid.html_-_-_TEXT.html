• P- coumaric Acid Production:
The aim of modeling P-coumaric Acid production is to predict the amount and the activity of this enzyme ,Sam8, and the production of  p-coumaric acid. The model was created mainly by designing ODEs and enzyme kinetics equations .Then; these equations were solved by the help of MATLAB software.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In our circuit, Sam8 gene is transcribed with B. subtilis specific constituve promoter Pveg.  SacB is transcribed with Sam8 gene for secretion out of cell.
 
 
 
 
Mathematical model:
Differential equations:
• In our model, we calculated the
[1]
Simulation:
• We have calculated our enzyme activity according to our enzyme production rate. In 3500 s ,  12E9 molecule of p-coumaric acid is produced according to our model.
