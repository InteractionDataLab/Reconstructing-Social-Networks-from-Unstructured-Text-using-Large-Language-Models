Emre, Özgün, Şeniz, Ilkem, Bilge, Begüm, Betül, Selin, Munta, Alişan,  Hakan, Oğuz,  Buse
 
- stocks have been prepared, chloramphenicol and kanamaycin are working.
 
-the plates that have been prepared,
C3, chl. amp. kan. Çağlar chl. amp. kan. Çağlar (new) chl. amp. kan.
Have been put into incubator at 8:50 p.m
 
-500 mL LB has been prepared, in the fridge.
-Buse have prepared LB and Agar.
 
- R.A Mustafa Çiçek's sample has been prepared again.
 
-measured the o.d of the samples. The results:
C3=0.301
Çağlar= 746
Competent cells are divided into two groups. The sample of Çağlar, is maden microcentrifuge at 4:30 p.m
At 5:20 CaCl2 is added, and let it cool.
 
Attention please! Do not leave Agars in -20 fridge. We lost all of the samples because of that mistake.
-I would kill youn if you could not find my eraser! ( Hakan )
 
-at 8:42 p.m the flasks are made ready for tomorrow morning to be autoclaved.
 
-the dirty equipments are leaved in the pot.
 
At 9:03 p.m plates are covered by parafilm and put into +4 fridge the place that iGEM METU Labelled,
Hood is cleaned by ethanol, sterilized by uv light and shutted down.
 
 06.03.2013 Wednesday.
 
- C3 and Çağlar samples are taken from the shaker,
 
-25 microliter and 100 microliter cells spread into small and large plates.

-The plates have been put into incubator at 5:20 p.m.
 
-the bunsen burner gases have been shutted down and checked, the bench cleaned with ethanol
 
07.03.2013
Chemicals are put into +4 fridge.calculations made for chemicals. Lab 206 enable us to get nuclease free water.
 
Antibiotics are prepared in these concentrations
 
Amp: 50mg/mL ( 1000X)
Kan: 50mg/mL (1000X)
Chl: 25 mg/mL (1000X) in ethanol
Tetr: 15mg/mL ( 1000X)
 
Note that chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water completely, that is why we are preparing the stock with 70% or more ethanol.
 
Also ampicillin does not dissolve in water completely, in the bottle it says dissolve in acid, Emre will search how we can prepare it.
 
We should be tidy by putting our stuffs in the closet. We had an accident today...
 
Tommorrow dh5alphas o.d is going to be measured. 2 from 05.03.2013
2 from 04.03.2013 and 2 fresh.
70% ethanol will be prepared
 
Dirty equipments are going to be autoclaved
 
 
08.03.2013
 
Measured the dh5alpha cells o.d . The value is 0.184
 
100 mL LB and 1 mL dh5alpha culture prepared in a flask.
 
Now we are trying to find a way to enter in the room that has shaker in it.
 
1:16 p.m the culture in the flask is put in the shaker, we borrow Eser Ünsaldı 's ID cart. It shoul be taken from the shaker after 2-4 hours.
 
At 3:43 p.m
 80% glycerol has been prepared 50 mL in a falcon in +4 fridge.
 
The sample is take  from the shaker. Spectrphotometer shows us Mustafa Çiçek's dh5alpha e.coli 0.013 ABS sonucunu verdi (wavelength 595 and 600nm). That makes us surprised and we take a deep breathe and hold it, prepare again.
 
 
18.03.2013
 
When we come to the lan, the bench were very dirty, we clean it with a detergent and ethanol.
Our team have a meeting with metumech (the student club for metu mechanical engineering student at metu). We are preparing over-night cultures.
 
19.03.2013
 
O.d results => 05.03 : 249
04.03: 1.351
Stock 150 dh5alpha 1954
Stock250 dh5alpha 0.003
 
Autoclave is done.
 
We shoul prepare the competent cells but the o.d values of dh5alpha cells are very low ( about 0.01). So we let the cells grow more in the shaker.
 
The second o.d value is 0.093 at 3:40 p.m
At 4 p.m AlperMutlu helps us to prepare antibiotics stock.
Amphicillin/ 100 mg /mL ( sodium salt, does not works with our water)
0.5gr/5mL prepared.
 
The one that we have dissolves in nh4oh
 
0.5 gr amp
5 mL distilled water in a nonstreile falcon
Mix the water and amp in the falcon
Vortex to dissolve completely
Filtred for strelizition
 
Kanamycin stock50Mg /mL
 
250mg/5mL prepared
Procedure is thensame as amphicillin
 
The cells taken from shaker the o.d value is 280
Tehy should be taken at 2 p.m. The measurements made in Gülay Ozcengiz's lab.
 
A beaker labelled as nonsterille because used as a waste
 
The values measured at 2 p.m Mustafa:195nm C3: 147nm Çağlar:340nm the measurements made in 595nm because we could not make it 600nm
 
We had been prepared cells three days ago and keep it at +4 fridge but when we do the measuremens again the o.d values are  very low so, we learnt that we should not trust the fridge, the cells may be die because of the very low temperature.

- And I have done the exit controls.
Night:
- There is something black in Topten2 Amp/2. No, there is not something black in my eye and I do not make things up with my ass.
- There is growth in Amp1 and Chl1. We marked the area in which we observed growth at Chl2.
- We tried to select colonies from J04450 (Chl Backbone) streaks.
[To prevent the weird sesame plate we think that we shouldn’t shake the agar too much. The cause of sesame plate is still being investigated.]
- At 17:40 J04450 will be taken out of the incubator.
- At 19:30 ONCs of ligations will be taken.
Note for Selin: Alişan will come and check the PCR tomorrow.

17:30
- We came to look at the plates and they are full of elliptic air balloons. We are scared. We went to ask Selin and came across our teacher Ayça. She said that ellipses are not cell colonies just air bubbles. She said that this could happen if we are using the agar plates before drying them properly. She said that we should have waited at least an hour after pouring agar into plates.
18:05
- We saw growth in only one of the streak plates of J04450.
- We prepared ONC with Chl LB (10ml/10ul). It should be out at 10:05 tomorrow morning. It is in back of the shaker at lab 214.

After we planted Bacillius we saw sesame plates – before we planted the cells they were normal plates. We thought that we could distinguish sesames from colonies. (50,100,150 ul from 3 samples, 9 plates in total.)
We prepared antibiotic plates and put them into +4 room.
Kanamycin – 22
