Although METU has been participating in iGEM for 6 years now, iGEM never caught the attention it deserved, mainly because of the technical roots of our school and the fascinating engineering clubs and their projects.
 
It was time for this trend to change.

Comic book
We met an illustrator and explained our Project to him. While we has amazed by the Project and agreed on helping us by illustrating a comic book about our Project, the book got canceled due to the protests in summer, our illustrator friend had to draw about those matters and sadly had not the time for our book.
Association (STRAND)
This year we did not confine ourselves to spread iGEM idea to our immediate surroundings. We wanted to share synthetic biology to all over the country. For this purpose, we established a association called STRAND. With the help of this association, we could reach many people who are not restricted to Ankara. To do this, we prepared our regulations and other necessary stuff. Then we rendered these documents to relevant authority. We are still waiting for their response.
