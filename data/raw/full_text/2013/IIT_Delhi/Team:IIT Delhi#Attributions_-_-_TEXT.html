Prof. PVM Rao:
Prof. Rao of the Mechanical Engineering department at IIT Delhi is the coordinator of the innovation centre of IIT which was responsible for providing us funds to do our project. He has been a driving force when it came to helping our team with funding. His ever optimistic attitude and love for science have been a great motivating factor for our team.
Prof. James Gomes:
Prof. James Gomes of the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, IIT Delhi was a great help to us when it came to modeling our system. His effervescent nature, ensured that the discussions with him were always fun and super interesting. While modeling our system, we inadvertently ended up learning a lot about systems biology from him.
CSS Pavan:
An iGEM veteran, he was an integral part of the first eve iGEM team from IIT Delhi (iGEM  2010). He has been our team’s sensei, guiding us every time we faced problems. Our very own Yoda, he helped us in conceptualizing our project. He’s a wise man who’s going to the Weizmann Institute of science as a research scholar. We wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.
Ms. Pooja Singh:
Ms. Pooja Singh is a PhD student who’s working under Dr. Preeti Srivastava (one of our faculty mentors). Since we were working in Dr. Preeti’s lab, Pooja was always there whenever we needed any help. She took a great deal of interest in our project and also eased us into the labwork. We owe her gratitude for all her help.
Department of Biotechnology :
The Department of Biotechnology of the Ministry of Science and technology has provided us with funds to take part in iGEM. We are grateful to them for their help and support.
