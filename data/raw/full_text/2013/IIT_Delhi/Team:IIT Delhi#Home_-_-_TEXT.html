iGEM in South Asia
Project Description
pH based bacterial systems, wherein response is dependent on the pH of the medium have been explored rarely in iGEM (NYMU-Taipei(2008), Wisconsin-Madison(2010) others). pH based sensor systems have potential use in bio-remediation, gut-microbiota engineering, fermentation et cetera.
pH based systems present various other challenges with respect to biobrick usability, pH dependence of reporters and lack of characterization.Our aim is to create a simple pH "bacterial" meter, not unlike a pH strip used in chemistry. We hope for this to be a template for future projects and applications
