Faculty Advisors
We were fortunate enough to be mentored by three faculty members from the Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology (DBEB), IIT Delhi. They took active interest in the project, with the team presenting bi-weekly reports to all of them. We worked in Dr. Preeti's lab and under her direct supervision. Our mentors also helped in the initial stages of our project. They told us about the feasibility of various ideas which we put forth and finally helped us in shaping our current project idea. Their feedback was always helpful for us. We could not have reached this far if it was not for them and we want to sincerely thank them.
