please note:
The Rutgers iGEM website was designed with much love and care, but porting to MediaWiki's HTML format was not accounted for, nor was it mastered in time, and our Team Wiki is now slightly messier than our original design (hosted on github). We'd like to share the external and unbroken version our wiki, because Kenny thinks it's prettier, so it can be found at http://kostenba.de/iGEMwiki2013/
(which simply serves the html files directly from github)
. The corresponding code can be browsed at https://github.com/svensken/iGEMwiki2013/tree/gh-pages . We appreciate the implementation of MediaWiki that iGEM has made work so well for so many team pages, and we doubly appreciate the strong culture for Open Source that this contest advocates. Rock on, iGEM.
