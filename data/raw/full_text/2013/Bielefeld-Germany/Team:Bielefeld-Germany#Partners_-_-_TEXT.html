Participation in the iGEM competition is extremely expensive and must be fully self-financed. The costs include participation fees, departure to the competitions and accommodation during the competition, not including the costs for laboratory materials. The finances to cover the costs must be organized by the team, which is only possible through the financial support of sponsors.
Therefore, the search for sponsors is an essential task in the first months of the competition. Numerous phone calls, emails and presentations are needed to find enough supporters.
In this sense, the iGEM Team Bielefeld wants to thank the following sponsors and partners for their support.
Sponsoring materials for enterprises in order to find new supporters.

Merck is a global pharmaceutical and chemical company with total revenues of € 10.3 billion in 2011, a history that began in 1668, and a future shaped by more than 40,000 employees in 68 countries. Its success is characterized by innovations from entrepreneurial employees. Merck's operating activities come under the umbrella of Merck KGaA, in which the Merck family holds an approximately 70% interest and free shareholders own the remaining approximately 30%. In 1917 the U.S. subsidiary Merck & Co. was expropriated and has been an independent company ever since. For more information about Merck, visit www.merckgroup.com .
