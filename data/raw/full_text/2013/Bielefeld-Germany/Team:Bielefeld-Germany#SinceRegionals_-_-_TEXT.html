Overview
Since the European Jamboree in Lyon we have been busy and continued working on our project. We managed to create serveral devices by different combinations of the mediator producing parts and the outer membrane porin, did some modelling on the maximal yield of glycerol as a carbon source and conducted additional measurements with our MFC. We even printed a car that was supposed to be powered by our MFC.
Genetic Optimization
In order to test the effect of the protein expression of the outer membrane porin OprF and the glycerol dehydrogenase GldA on the cell growth, growth was measured as increase in optical density and plotted against time.
We constructed new devices by combination of the mediator producing parts (riboflavin synthesis gene cluster and glycerol dehydrogenase) with the outer membrane porin OprF.
<bbpart>BBa_K1172566</bbpart> - OprF and GldA (Device):  Combination of the outer membrane porin OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172502</bbpart>) and the glycerol dehydrogenase GldA (<bbpart>BBa_K1172201</bbpart>) under control of T7 promoter.
<bbpart>BBa_K1172577</bbpart> - OprF and GldA (Coding):  Combination of the outer membrane porin OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172501</bbpart>) and the glycerol dehydrogenase GldA (<bbpart>BBa_K1172201</bbpart>).
<bbpart>BBa_K1172588</bbpart> - OprF and Riboflavin synthesis gene cluster (Device):  Combination of the outer membrane porin OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172502</bbpart>) and Riboflavin synthesis gene cluster (<bbpart>BBa_K1172303</bbpart>) under control of T7 promoter.
<bbpart>BBa_K1172599</bbpart> - OprF and Riboflavin synthesis gene cluster (Coding):  Combination of the outer membrane porin OprF (<bbpart>BBa_K1172501</bbpart>) and the Riboflavin synthesis gene cluster (<bbpart>BBa_K1172303</bbpart>).
We managed to show the functionality of the device <bbpart>BBa_K1172588</bbpart> through fluorescent measurement .
Engineering Optimization
We have designed a fuel cell that can be used with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode . We used it to gain a better understanding of the reactions taking place in the cathode chamber.
To illustrate the application we 3D printed a car , that was supposed to be powered by our MFC.
In order to assess the effectiveness of our system in a better way, different efficiencies and ratios were calculated.
Human Practice
We can present the evaluation of the Day of Synthetic Biology . While performing this event in early September, 52 people from Bielefeld were consulted regarding their opinion about Synthetic Biology and our project. The survey shows very interesting results.
We asked Dr. Arnold Sauter from the Office of Technology Assessment at the German Bundestag (TAB) for helping us by classification our project in terms of biosafety and the impact of our human practice activities to establish public awareness.
We received an evaluation of our project regarding future applicability of our MFC and Microbial Fuel Cells in general, by Aeneas Wanner, general manager of a swiss company that advises other companies and Organizations on how to raise energy efficiency.
