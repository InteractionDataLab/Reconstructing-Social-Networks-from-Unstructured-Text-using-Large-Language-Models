Overview
During the work on our project we took a lot of nice pictures and recorded some videos inside and outside the lab. On this page we like to present the nicest, most impressive pictures and images from our collection and give a better optical impression of our work and the final results.

Assembly of our MFC stack in fast motion. The stack consists of six combined 3rd generation Fuel Cells wired in parallel with a total of 173 separate parts.
Watch our stack of five MFCs with genetically optimized E. coli produce 2.4 V and thereby lighting several LEDs, enable sound output from a little buzzer and power a small fan.
See a 3D printer print our DIY-MFC from biodegradable PLA plastic.
Encapsulated ferric oxide inside alginate beads to use them in cultivation experiments as insoluble terminal electron acceptor
