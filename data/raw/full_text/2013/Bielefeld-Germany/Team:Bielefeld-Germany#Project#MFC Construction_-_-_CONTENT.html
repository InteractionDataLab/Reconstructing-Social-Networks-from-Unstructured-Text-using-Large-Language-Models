To determine how well the different BioBricks we create really work in the designated environment, the design and construction of a suitable microbial fuel cell is necessary. This fuel cell has to meet several requirements. As explained <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#General_design" class="external text" rel="nofollow">previously</A> it should consist of two chambers, separated by a material that is only traversable for cations. Both chambers have to contain an electrically conductive electrode. Also, they should have a large surface area, in order to allow contact to a high number of electron donors at the same time. Both the anode and the cathode chamber also have to be air-tight, since the reaction has to take place under anaerobic conditions. For obvious reasons, we aim at keeping the costs for the cell low by using materials which cost as little as possible while still performing well.
Construction of a first prototype began in May. After initial testing, the design underwent significant changes over the course of the project. Important stages of this process are shown below, along with a description of their design and the flaws that led to the planning of a new model.

The basic design of a microbial fuel cell is mainly influenced by the shape of the electrode chambers. A very simple design is called the “H” shape, which usually consists of two bottles or other vessels, connected by a tube containing material suitable for proton exchange. Further investigations underlined usefulness of such systems for testing of materials or parameters, but the power gain is rather low. This is most likely the case because of the slow proton exchange through the tubes and because of a high internal resistance  (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Oh <I>et al.</I>, 2004; Oh and Logan, 2006</A>).</P><P align="justify">
There are many other possible shapes, like a cylindrical reactor with a concentric inner tube that acts as the cathode to enable a continuous flow. One specific design, proposed by H. P. Bennetto (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bennetto, 1990</A>), is often used for research purposes. The system consists of plastic elements in form of two solid plates and two frames, as shown in Figure 2. The frames are placed between the plates and form two reaction compartments, separated by a cation exchange membrane. Furthermore, every compartment is equipped with electrodes to enable a flow of electrons. To ensure the system is air-tight, rubber gaskets are fitted between the plastic parts. The endplates are held together by four threaded rods.

Materials have to be highly conductive, biocompatible and chemically stable under the conditions present inside the fuel cell in order to be used as an anode. Many traditional materials like copper are not suitable, because they corrode or have a toxic effect on the bacteria. Platinum works excellent, but is extremely expensive. Several carbon-based materials provide a cheap but practical alternative. Regardless of the type of material, the electrodes surface area is a very important factor for current production. Previous investigations showed that current increases with the overall internal surface in the following order: carbon felt &gt; carbon foam &gt; graphite (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chaudhuri and Lovley, 2003</A>).

Because of its low overpotential in combination with carbon electrodes and the resulting working potential, which is close to its open circuit potential, potassium ferricyanide (K<SUB>3</SUB>)[Fe(CN) <SUB>6</SUB>]) is the most frequently used electron acceptor in microbial fuel cells in research scenarios (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Logan <I>et al.</I>, 2006</A>). However, one has to consider that the reoxidation by oxygen is very low and the diffusion through the PEM is not negligible, so the oxidation of this substance can affect the performance of the MFC when operated for long periods of time (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Rabaey <I>et al.</I>, 2005</A>). Alternatively, oxygen can be used as a very effective electron acceptor in combination with an open-air electrode. For an effective oxygen reduction, however, high-cost platinum catalysts are necessary. For this reason, this option is rarely used (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Sell <I>et al.</I>, 1989</A>). </P><UL><LI><B>Requirements:</B></LI><LI>good reduction performance

Although almost all microbial fuel cells use proton exchange membranes as the separation element between anode and cathode compartment, it is possible to use more simple constructions like salt or agarose bridges. These basic separation systems, however, do not reach the power output of membrane based systems because of their high internal resistance. Cation exchange membranes offer defined properties and ensure a better current output because of their high selectivity for the passage of positive charged ions. However, in this context it has to be considered that the PEM could be permeable to chemicals and oxygen, which might influence the long term performance of the fuel cell (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC&amp;action=submit#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Logan <I>et al.</I>,2006</A>).

Our first model was constructed out of film canisters and was designed to gain a better understanding of the general concept of galvanic cells and microbial fuel cells. It was used with different chemicals, yeast and the <I>E. coli</I> KRX strain. It also allowed to gather experience with the equipment used for measurement. The anode and cathode chambers are film canisters. Both are connected by a segment of a 15 mL centrifugation tube with a total length of two centimeters. The individual parts are held together by hot-melt glue. The centrifugation tube is filled with 3 % agarose, which acts as a salt bridge to allow protons to pass from anode to cathode chamber. In both chambers, pieces of carbon tissue (see Figure 4) act as the electrode.</P><DIV style="float:left; margin-right:1px; width:48%"><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:272px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 4: Carbon tissue material.

The biggest problem of this design is the salt bridge connecting both chambers. After being submerged in liquid for a while, it tends to become loose and glide out of the centrifugation tube.

This cell was designed with anaerobic operation in mind. The plastic parts needed were ordered from the workshop of the Faculty of Biology at Bielefeld University. The overall design is inspired by the fuel cell proposed by Benetto (Bennetto, 1990). Two frames make up the anode and cathode chamber. They are enclosed by two flat plates, each containing four bores. Threaded rods are put through the bores. The construction is held together by these rods, which have tightly fastened nuts on their ends.
All plastic parts are separated by thin rubber gaskets. A Nafion N117 membrane is placed between the two frames to allow cations to travel between the chambers. The two electrodes were initially cut out of the same carbon tissue as the ones used in the film canister cells. The rims were sown together with extra durable yarn to prevent the material from frazzling. These electrodes were held in place by two plastic parts plugged in each chamber. The copper wire connecting the electrode runs through two holes on the top of each plastic frame.
Initial testing revealed that the carbon cloth electrodes did not seem to be as conductive as expected. For this reason, they were replaced with electrodes made from another kind of carbon material, which were obtained from University of Readings <A href="http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">National Centre for Biotechnology Education </A>. However, the material is not very strong and easily ruptures, especially when wet. This made it difficult to connect the copper wires and to hold the electrodes in place within the chambers. The design also lacked means to drive out the oxygen from medium with nitrogen, an important prerequisite to establish anaerobic conditions within the fuel cell.

The fuel cell consists of six plastic parts. The overall design is similar to 2<SUP>nd</SUP> generation cell, but the frames are split up into two parts each. This allows for the carbon electrodes to be mounted between two frames, as was already the case for the membrane before. This ensures the fragile carbon cloth is fixed in the center of each chamber and can be tapped by squeezing a wire between the gaskets. Since the material is highly porous, bacteria and medium can diffuse through the electrode and travel between both halves of a single chamber.
The second important change from the previous design is the introduction of four tube connectors on each frame. This allows aeration of the anode chamber with nitrogen gas and, e.g., introducing fresh medium in the system. The copper wire connecting the electrodes is replaced with platinum, because of the rapid copper-oxidation, resulting in a decreased conductivity.</P><UL><LI>Dimensions per chamber:

To make the microbial fuel cell accessible to everyone, an additional model was developed which can be produced using a 3D printer. 3D printers are becoming more and more common and if none is available, the model can be ordered online from a 3D printing shop.
For our 3D printed microbial fuel cell it was important to apply material that does not inhibit microbial growth. To make sure this is the case, <I>E. coli</I> KRX was cultivated in the presence of two different kinds of plastic commonly used for 3D printing. These materials were acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), which are both thermoplastics that become moldable when heated and return to solid once the temperature drops.
A proper material for gaskets is essential as well, so different kinds of polysiloxane were tested in the same way.

3D models were programmed with the software <A href="http://www.openscad.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">openSCAD</A>, exported as .stl-files and translated into G-Code using <A href="http://slic3r.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Slic3r</A>.
Initially, slicing and printing took place at the local <A href="http://hackerspace-bielefeld.de/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">hackerspace</A> with counseling by experienced members of the groups. The printer, a <A href="http://printrbot.com/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Printrbot Plus v2</A> was made available by the hackerspace community as well. After a total of roughly 34 hours of work, a first model was successfully printed from ABS. Like the models described in the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#MFC-Evolution" class="external text" rel="nofollow">MFC-Evolution paragraph</A>, the design was changed several times. Some of the results can be seen in Figure 17. In early August, Bielefeld Universities Faculty of Physics offered their help. They printed out all subsequent designs with their <A href="http://www.reprappro.com/products/mono-mendel/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RepRapPro Mono-Mendel</A> using PLA plastic and also executed the slicing process.

The final model, illustrated in Figure 19, was finished in September. It features a 4-part design like the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#The_Second_Generation_Fuel_Cell" class="external text" rel="nofollow">second generation model</A> described in the MFC-Evolution section and has tube connectors for aeration of each individual chamber. Polysiloxane is used instead of rubber gaskets, the membrane and electrodes are fixed between the four frames of the reaction chambers. The end plates are held together by M3 threaded rods with M3 nuts. The materials necessary for building this fuel cells chassis cost less than 4€ and the cell is biodegradable.
