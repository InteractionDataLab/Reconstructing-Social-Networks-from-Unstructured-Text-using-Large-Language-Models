The team finding is over, the iGEM-Team Bielefeld 2013 is complete. Overall we are ten students, eight studying molecular biotechnology and two genome-based systems biology. Three of us are bachelor students and seven are master students). We'll have a great time with a lot of fun, but also a lot of work is ahead.
We have created our official german website.
We’ve designed our team logo 2013 with orange as our team color.
In order to find enough financial supporters we've made a sponsorship portfolio.
February
Manuel will be our social media manager.
We are planning an iGEM weekend with the whole team for team finding and planning the project.
Creating an inlet for the sponsorship portfolio with additional information for interested companies.
Interesting brainstorming for the further topic selection, here are some of our ideas:
Mercury detection
Monolinoren (lindane) reduction / detection
Polyurethane degradation by fungi
Smog filter
Complexing toxic gold ions
Radiation / x-ray radiation: before-after proteomsensor
Biocatalytic batteries, redox reactions in bacteria: Microbial Fuel Cells (Maybe Cell free systems)
Bacteriorhodopsin, bacterial cell as data storage
Heparin production by bacteria
Scent bacteria
A rapid test for fungal infections
Mold filter
Biological heating by microorganisms (Hummel heating) and warmers in biodegradable materials
Plastic degradation by fungi with Polyurethanase
Prevention of biofilm formation in different systems
March
After assessment of all subjects we will concentrate and incorporate into the microbial fuel cell issue (cytochromes and nanowires are interesting starting points for synthetic biology).
We had a brief presentation at Merck KGaA head office in Darmstadt, together with the iGEM team 2012 concerning a possible sponsorship in 2013.
Short presentation at Evonik Industries AG in Halle / Kuensebeck for a possible further sponsorship of the iGEM team Bielefeld.
Deeper incorporation into the Fuel Cell topic with the following points:
Microbial Fuel Cell
Enzymatic Fuel Cell
Reversed Microbial Fuel Cell
April
Agreement and focus on the official Topic 2013: Microbial Fuel Cell.
rMFC (reverse microbial fuel cell) and EFC (enzymatic fuel cell) won’t offer enough starting points for synthetic biology.
We will build a MFC with genetically engineered Escherichia coli by introducing porines, cytochromes, nanowires and mediators. Beyond we will use the potential on the cathode site (possible immobilization of laccases, using expertise from 2012 iGEM team ).
Our team is officially registered for iGEM 2013.
Laboratory work can begin. We had the safety briefing from our instructor Dr. Jörn Kalinowski.
Having a great iGEM team weekend in a holiday home in Winterberg with many presentations on each sub project and general laboratory methods.
