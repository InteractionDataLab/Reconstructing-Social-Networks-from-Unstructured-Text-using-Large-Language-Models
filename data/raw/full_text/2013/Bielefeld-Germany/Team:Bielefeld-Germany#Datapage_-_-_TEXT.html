Overview
This page gives a basic overview about our our project Ecolectricity - currently available. A detailed description of our subprojects can be found in our project part of the Wiki.
Project description: The goal of our project is to generate electrical energy with a genetically modified Escherichia coli in a self-constructed Fuel Cell. Besides the design, construction and technical optimization of the fuel cell, we investigate different genetic approaches. Specific electron transfer proteins have been compiled from a variety of organisms, in order to gain an Escherichia coli Fuel Cell platform which turns E. coli to an electro active organism. The main challenge is to ensure an efficient electron transfer from the bacteria to the electrode. Therefore we facilitate and improve electron donation by producing electron-shuttles, so called endogenous mediators, as well as permeabilizing the cell surface by integrating large membrane porins and providing a direct electron pathway by conductive transmembrane protein structures. All these electron transport elements increase electron transfer and bioelectricity generation.
Data for our favorite new parts
<bbpart>BBa_K1172501</bbpart> - OprF – Outer membrane porin from Pseudomonas fluorescens: This outer membrane porin enhances membrane permeability and electron shuttle-mediated extracellular electron transfer for higher bioelectricity output.
<bbpart>BBa_K1172901</bbpart> - Alanine racemase from E. coli: Catalyzes the reversible isomerization from L-alanine into the enatiomer D-alanine. In an D-alanine auxotrophic strain it can be used as a antibiotic free selection marker.
