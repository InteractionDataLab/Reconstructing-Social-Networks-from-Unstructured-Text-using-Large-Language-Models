[SDS-PAGE]
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Pouring the polyacrylamide gel
- Make a master mix for the stacking and separating gel without adding ammonium persulfate and TEMED
- Aliquote 6,5 mL for each separating and 2,5 mL for each stacking gel
- Add ammonium persulfate and TEMED to each separating gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into your gel casting form. Leave about 2 centimeters below the bottom of the comb for the stacking gel
- Layer isopropanol on top of the ge
- Leave the separating gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize
- Remove isopropanol and wait until the surface is dry
- Add ammonium persulfate and TEMED to each separating gel aliquote and pour the solution quickly into your gel casting form
- Insert comb without getting bubbles stuck underneath
- Leave the gel at room temperature for >60 minutes to polymerize
For storage:
-Remove sealing and store the gel wrapped in moistened paper towel at 4°C
Preparing the sample
- Mix your protein mixture 4:1 with Laemmli-buffer (30 mL protein solution + 10 mL Laemmli-buffer)
- Heat for 5 minutes at 95 °C
Running the gel
- Remove sealing, put the polymerized gel into gel box and pour SDS running buffer into the negative and positive electrode chamber
- Remove comb without destroying the gel pocket
- Pipet the sample into the gel pockets, adjusting the volume according to the amount of protein in your sample. Make sure to include a lane with molecular     weight standards (PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder™ (Fa. Fermentas)) to determinate the molecular weight of your sample
- Connect the power lead and run the stacking gel with 10 mA until the blue dye front enters the separating gel
- Raise amperage up to 20 mA for running the separating gel
- When the distance of the lowest molecular weight standard lane to the gel end is down to 0.5 cm stop the electrophoresis by turning off the power supply
[NADH-Assay]
This method has been used for measurement of intracellular NADH concentration.
Protocol:
• Inoculate an overnight culture (30 mL with 1 mL of pre-culture)
• Centrifugate (5 min at 5000 g) of 6-10 mL overnight culture (OD 4-6), adjust volume between different samples for the approximation of the number of cells
• Discard supernatant and wash pellet 3 times with 1 mL of PBS buffer
• Resuspend pellet in 1 mL PBS buffer
• Cell disruption by Ribolysation (3 x 30 sec at 6500 rpm)
• Centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed
• Store supernatant at - 20 ° C or direct measurement with Tecan Infinite® M200 platereader
Tecan Infinite® M200 platereader parameters:
• Sample volume = 100 μL clear supernatant
• Excitation = 340 nm
• Emission = 460 nm
• Concentration calculation by NADH calibration curve
[Hexadecan Assay]
This assay has been used to measure cell membrane hydrophobicity.
Protocol
• Inoculate an overnight culture (30 mL with 1 mL of pre-culture)
• Centrifugate (5 min at 4000 g) of 2 mL overnight culture (OD 4-6)
• Discard supernatant and wash pellet 3 times with 1 mL of PBS buffer
• Resuspend pellet in 1 mL 0,9% NaCl and measurement of OD600
• Add x μL of washed cells to 0,9% NaCl for a final volume of 3 mL . Final OD600 should be approximately 0,3 (denoted as A0, calculate exact value)
• Add 3 mL Hexadecan and vortex for 60 sec
• Incubation for 15 min
• Discard the upper organic phase and measure OD600 of the aqueous phase (denoted as A)
• Hydrophobicity can be calculated using the equation: affinity [%] = 100 x [1 – (A/A0)]
[Cold osmotic shock]
Release of periplasmic protein fraction from E. coli by cold osmotic shock
Modified protocol from [[Neu & Heppel (1965)]]
• Centrifuge E. coli cell suspension for 5 min at 14,000 g (4 °C) to collect the cells
• Discard the entire supernatant
• Resuspend the cells in ice-cold [[cell fractionating buffer 1]]. The resulting volume should be 1/4 of the former suspension volume
• Incubate for 20 min on ice. Invert the suspension at regular intervals to counteract sedimentation
• Centrifuge the cell suspension for 15 min at 14,000 g (4 °C)
• Discard the entire supernatant
• Resuspend the cells in ice-cold [[cell fractionating buffer 2]]. The resulting volume should be 1/4 of the former suspension volume
• Incubate for 10 up to 20 min on ice under regular invertion
• Centrifuge the cell suspension for 15 min at 14,000 g (4 °C)
• Save the supernatant, which contains the periplasmatic proteins and membrane proteins when using [[Cell fractionating buffer 2.2]] and [[2.3]]
• If the periplasmatic protein fraction is turbid, re-centrifuge and filter it through a 0.2 µm filter
