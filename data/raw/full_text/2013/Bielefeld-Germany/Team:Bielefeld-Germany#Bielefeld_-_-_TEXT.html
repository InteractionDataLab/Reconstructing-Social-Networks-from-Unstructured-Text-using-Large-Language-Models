Bielefeld is located in the region of Eastern Westphalia (Ostwestfalen-Lippe or short "OWL"), the most northeastern administrative district in the federal state of North-Rhine Westphalia . Covering approximately one-fifth of the state, it has a population of more than 2 million inhabitants. Internationally known companies like Benteler, Bertelsmann, Claas, Dr. Oetker, Gerry Weber, Gildemeister, Melitta, Miele, Schüco, and Wincor Nixdorf are based in Eastern Westphalia which makes it one of the strongest economic regions in Germany.  With its population of 325.000 inhabitants Bielefeld is one of 20 major cities in Germany and is a large economical and cultural center in this region. It has a developed infrastructure and excellent connections by many means of transport to major cities in Germany. Bielefeld is situated near the Teutoburger forest, which makes it attractive to everyone, who likes outdoor activities.
Bielefeld University
Bielefeld University
Bielefeld University was founded in 1969. It is known for its interdisciplinary high-quality research and teaching. It comprises 13 faculties, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines in the humanities, natural and technical sciences, social studies and pedagogics. There are around 20,000 students, among them 1700 international students, who study here in 107 degree courses. In the next few years, the Bielefeld campus will be developed into one of the most modern facilities in Europe, offering an excellent environment for studying. The research profile of the university focuses on interdisciplinary studies. The university of Bielefeld is mainly known for its strong sociology faculty, but in recent years cutting-edge research in robotics and biotechnology added strongly to its profile.
Center for Biotechnology, CeBiTec
CeBiTec, Bielefeld
Since the founding of the CeBiTec (Center for Biotechnology ) in 1998 by the senate of Bielefeld University a broad range of techniques and equipment to cover all „omics“ research fields have been established. In the summer of 2007 the CeBiTec resided into a new building on the campus of Bielefeld University. The building offers laboratories for the Institute for Genome Research and Systems Biology, in particular for the Technology Platform Genomics. With focus on international collaborations, the platform hosts several techniques including sequencing (454 as well as illumina), transcriptomics and annotations over proteomics (GC-GC-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, qTOF-MS) up to the metabolomics. Furthermore, the Chair of Genome Research is based in the building. Also the Institute for Biophysics and Nanosciences and the Institute for Biochemistry and Bioengineering run specific laboratories. Thus, the CeBiTec creates an unique environment of excellent competence.
