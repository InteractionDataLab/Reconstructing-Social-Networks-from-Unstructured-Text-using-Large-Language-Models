For independent consideration of the anode or cathode compartments potential, a Ag/AgCl <A href="http://www.meinsberger-elektroden.de/labor/bezug.html#se10" class="external text" rel="nofollow">reference electrode</A> was ordered and the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#The_Gen3plus_Fuel_Cell" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gen3<SUP><I>plus</I></SUP> MFC</A> was designed and constructed to make the new electrode usable.

In the beginning the cell potential is very low, because the cells cannot transport the produced electrons to the anode. After addition of the mediator solution the cell potential shows a characteristic increase and reaches its maximum of 325 mV. The cathode potential against Ag/AgCl amounts about –360 mV at the start of the measurement, what was expected by calculating the potential using Nernst equation. The course of the measured potential values also shows a significant effect of mediator addition because of a polarization of both electrodes regarded to the resulting current flow, but it reach a stable value of -240 mV quickly. This and the calculated anode potential data show, that the anode potential is mainly responsible for the overall cell potential, so that the measurement of this value is suitable for the analysis of different bacteria strains or even enzymes, placed in the anode chamber.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify">As the detailed description of the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#The_Gen3plus_Fuel_Cell" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gen3<SUP><I>plus</I></SUP> MFC</A> indicates, the cell is furthermore optimized for a better power output in terms of a larger volume, higher N<SUB>2</SUB> aeration and an adapted mediator concentration. To generate different operating numbers for the established microbial fuel cell generation three plus the determination of the used substrate amounts was necessary. Because of the incompatibility between the mediator methylene blue and the separation column used for sugar analysis, a new purification method was established. The methylene blue containing samples were blended with a spatula tip of activated carbon to bind the mediator, inverted for two minutes and centrifuged at 10000 x g for 5 minutes.

Since the results of the genetic optimized <I>E. coli</I> strains illustrate the potential of genetic optimization in regard to a higher power output, a further increase in power output using <I>E. coli</I> can be assumed upon further research.</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P align="justify">Further important operation numbers to characterize the efficiency of a Microbial Fuel Cell are the maximum possible electric charge and the theoretical amount of energy. The so called Coulombic efficiency describes the ratio of electric charge which is actually transferred from substrate to the anode to the theoretical maximum of produced Coulombs. Based upon the following reaction, the maximum number of electrons produced per substrate is 14 (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC_Efficiency#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gomes <I>et al</I>., 2013</A>).</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P align="justify">The total electric charge was determined by integration of current, calculated from voltage using Ohms law over time:</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P align="justify">For calculating the energy efficiency, defined as the ratio of power production to the heat of combustion of the organic substrate, the power production was integrated over time:</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P align="justify">The calculated values of 1.56 % for the Coulombic efficiency and 0.308 % energy efficiency are located at the lower end of the available literature values (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC_Efficiency#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Liu <I>et al</I>., 2005</A>; <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC_Efficiency#References" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Logan <I>et al</I>., 2006</A>). The exact cause cannot be determined accurately because of the multitude of factors affecting the power output in a Microbial Fuel Cell. Relevant reasons might be the high energy amount of glycerol in contrast to wastewater, the Microbial Fuel Cell setup which is optimized for measurement value generation, or the organism <I>E. coli</I>. As stated previously <I>E. coli</I> is not adapted for anaerobic respiration and because of this fact a long term power output which is necessary for a high efficiency has not been possible right now and further genetic optimization is needed.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify">Since the mediator is an important factor, in regard to its essential function as the electron shuttle between <I>E. coli</I> and the anode, the  mediator functionality was characterized. For that purpose the mediator turnover number was calculated which is defined as the ratio between the amount of transported electrons and the amount of mediator:</P></LI></UL><UL><LI><P align="justify">The obtained turn over number of about 13 illustrates, that methylene blue is used as a reversible redox mediator. During the 200-minute experiment each mediator molecule transports on average 13 electrons from the bacterium to the anode. As this value corresponds to a turnover of 0.065 min<SUP>-1</SUP> the mediator activity of methylene blue could be a limiting factor in regard to the low efficiencies, too. To elucidate this hypothesis, a further investigation of the redox system is necessary, because the corresponding potential differences are essential for the efficient transfer of electrons between the substances used.</P></LI><LI><P align="justify">All in all the calculation of different operation numbers illustrate the general functionality of the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Project/MFC#The_Gen3plus_Fuel_Cell" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gen3<SUP><I>plus</I></SUP> MFC</A>.
