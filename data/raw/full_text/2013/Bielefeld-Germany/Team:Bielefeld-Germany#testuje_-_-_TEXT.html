PROJECT ABSTRACT
There is a growing interest in the use of alternative energy sources. Decreasing use of fossil fuels in the context of atmospheric greenhouse gas reduction, coupled with the recent reduction of nuclear power production in Germany have encouraged the search for alternative energy production processes. Generation of electricity at large scales can have negative impacts on local environments and the use of energy storage devices on a small scale holds the risk of release of toxic pollutants from batteries.In consideration of these issues, the iGEM team of Bielefeld University is undertaking a project called "Microbial fuel cell" (MFC) this year. The goal of this project is to use bacteria for direct energy production from organic substrates.
