Biosafety
Biosafety
Biosafety is an essential aspect when you work with living organisms that could possibly escape out of your application via damage or incorrect handling. We designed biosafety systems which counter this risk.

Results
Our aim was to produce electricity with our application, which we finally achieved successfully. On the way we got a lot of data, which we analyzed and formatted into graphics. Take a look.

Human Practice
Human Practice
It is important to get out of the lab and tell the public about your project and about synthetic biology. Therefore we arranged events and visited conferences in order to get in touch with the public.

Labjournal
Labjournal
We wrote all the experiments we did into a labjournal. We digitalized the lab journal so that everyone can comprehend our experiments and achieve reproducible results.
