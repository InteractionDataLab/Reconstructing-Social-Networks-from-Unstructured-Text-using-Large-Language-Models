Our 2013 parts submitted are a set of violacein genes derived from the violacein operon constructed and                      submitted by Cambridge in 2009 (BBa_K274002). We have made a number of modifications, including upgrading the                  plasmid backbone from pSB1K3 to pSB1C3 standard 10, and converting each of the five open reading frames into                  its own part with a common and improved ribosome binding site (BBa_B0030) such that they can be assembled in                  different combinations and permutations. All of the parts have been characterized and are functional, and we                  have found that a new combination, VioABCE, produces a new pigment which we call "Royal Blue".
