To general students on a study break:
See this basic and humourous not-to-do video (which was shown in University of                 Alberta’s EHS Biosafety Course): “Lab Unsafety and Septic Technique” by Jayson Masaki                  below or at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aDLV0UHyNE
For students not yet familiar with iGEM nor their recommended guidelines:
The World Health Organization gives a comprehensive guidebook for safety in labs at: http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/Biosafety7.pdf
