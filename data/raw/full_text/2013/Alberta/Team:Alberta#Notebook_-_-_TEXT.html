Welcome to the Team Alberta Wiki!
For visitors: this site is currently under construction. Please contact our Student Liason, Dawson at                  daocun@ualberta.ca, for more information on our current project and how to support us!
You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
