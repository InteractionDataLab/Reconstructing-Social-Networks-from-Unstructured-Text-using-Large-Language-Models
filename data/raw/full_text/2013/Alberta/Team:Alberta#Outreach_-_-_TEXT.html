Outreach: Consort, Alberta
As a part of our efforts to reach out to the local scientific community iGEM Alberta send one of            our team members to the small town of Consort, Alberta to assist their emerging high school iGEM            team. Consort is a town of about 700 people located east of Red Deer near the border with            Saskatchewan and only has one secondary school. Remarkably students from this small town high           school caught wind of the iGEM competition and decided to get involved. Their seclusion however was            the source of several problems. The Consort team lacked the proper equipment, materials, and training            to realize their goal of competing in iGEM. After hearing of their difficulties Mark Rozema travelled to            the small town to lend his assistance. Mark, a recent graduate, was able to provide much needed            materials such as ligase, buffer, and restriction enzymes. He also gave helpful suggestions to improve            their presentation and delivery and helped develop their safety component and abstract. We were            thrilled to be able to help a local high school iGEM team and look forward to future partnership with the            Consort iGEM team.
Consort, AB is a small town of about 700 people with one secondary school for its 70 high school                students.
The students practice their presentation in front of their parents               and an Alberta iGEM team member, Mark Rozema.
Consort, AB is located several hours from both Edmonton                and Calgary. Having little access to any major biochemistry                labs proved to be challenging for the team.
