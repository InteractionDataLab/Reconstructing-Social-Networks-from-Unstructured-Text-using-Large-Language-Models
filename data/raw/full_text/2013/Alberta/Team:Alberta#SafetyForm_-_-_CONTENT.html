          to team members.</P><P>All the components of our project are quite standard in molecular biology labs and are not associated with
          significant risks.  Our microorganisms, biological parts, laboratory equipment and chemicals are mostly
          comparably benign. The strains which our team intends to use and has used thus far are harmless 
          (nonpathogenic and non-toxigenic). The biological parts we are using consist of color, antibiotic-resistance 
          (Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, Ampicillin, Tetracycline) and various promoters. In terms of chemicals,
          the myriad of flammable solvents in the lab pose a notable risk, and in addition the ethidium bromide 
          (EtBr) is a dangerous toxin and mutagen.  EtBr is used to visualize DNA by soaking agarose gels in a 
          solution of the compound.  EtBr works by intercalating between bases in the DNA’s helical structure, 
          where is it able to fluoresce much more brightly than it does while in solution. It is generally established 
          that intercalating agents are mutagens, and that mutagens are carcinogens and for this reason EtBr is 
          treated with a high level of caution in our lab.  Experiments have shown that EtBr is able to cause DNA 
          damage in human cell lines so this carcinogenic potential is not just theoretical. To mitigate risks, 
          relevant 
          microbiological <A name="public">techniques</A> are consistently used in the lab and gloves are worn. Other precautions for 
          EtBr include the labelling of designated containers for EtBr gels and EtBr waste, and the reuse of EtBr 
          solution to minimize waste.</P><P>The most dangerous laboratory equipments we use are a transilluminator, gel apparatus, and the Bunsen
          burner. The risks posed by exposure to UV radiation, electric shocks and open flames can be easily
          controlled with proper safety training and protective equipment. A thick glass cover has been added to 
          one UV visualizer in the lab to protect eyes when visualizing gels. Usually, a different UV visualizer is 
          used for lab purposes because it photographs the gel without any UV exposure to eyes at all. Students 
          are taught how to properly use equipment, dispose of wastes, autoclave used glassware and 
          biologicallycontaminated waste, disinfect counters and know when to wear safety protection. Proper pipetting 
          protocol is always used.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>Public Safety</H2><P>The DH5-α strain with which our group is working (which is a derivative of K-12) is non-pathogenic and
          non-toxigenic, so it poses no risk to public health and safety.</P><P><A name="environment">A public concern</A>  is that the plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes could be released into the
          environment. Since our project uses antibiotic resistance genes as selection tools, we ensure that these 
          genes are properly disposed of by autoclaving.</P><P>In evaluating the risks, there is a lower chance of gene uptake by wild bacteria compared to our labstrain 
          bacteria that have perforated membranes. In the case that wild bacteria did uptake the antibiotic 
          resistance gene, that gene would eventually be lost in the population without exposure to the antibiotic, 
          because it is then a disadvantage for the bacteria to carry the unused plasmids and use up energy 
          to express them. Evidence for this was observed in multiple cases of measured declines in particular 
          antibiotic resistances after the human population limited the antibiotic usage (Klotins, 2005).</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>Environmental Safety</H2><P>The bacteria that we use in the laboratory are not well suited to survival in the environment and even 
          assuming they were able to do so, they do not have any destructive potential. 
          The standard and well-characterized biobytes we are using do not have the potential to combine in 
          dangerous ways. As with many other synthesized DNA constructs, we have found that our plasmids are 
          lost from the bacteria over time (if plated without antibiotic present), due to the expression of colors 
          being 
          an unproductive strain on the cell’s resources. Consequently, there is little risk of our microorganisms 
          spreading. Even if our <I>E. coli</I> strains survived and replicated in the wild, they are highly unlikely 
          to 
          cause harm to any humans or animals as risk level one microorganisms. The microorganisms we are 
          creating in the lab would have less potential for malicious misuse than any bacteria normally found in the 
          environment.</P><P>Although there is no intentional release to the environment and people, contamination is minimized
          by protective equipment (gloves) and disinfection. However, the microbe strain cannot survive outside 
          the lab environment because it is engineered to be weak and dependent on a lab nutrient mix (Luria
          Broth, LB agar).  In the improbable case that the microbe evolved (ex. By uptaking genes) to be able to 
          synthesize one of the essential amino acids, it still would be deficient in multiple other ways.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>Future risks from Commercialism</H2><P>Answering this question accurately is something of a complex endeavor, as one of the key aspects of
          <A name="training">our project</A> is that it is essentially a foundational advance.  As such there are probably many approaches 
          a focused group  of minds might be able to develop using some of the principle and methods we have 
          developed. However, even given the very open-ended nature of our project’s potential future, it is difficult 
          to envision scenarios in which significant dangers are encountered. It is possible that in the distant 
          future 
          our methods might be modified and used with organisms and/or genes that entail greater risks than the 
          non-pathogenic <I>E. coli</I> we have chosen to use. Even in this instance, the risks to personal, 
          environmental 
          and public safety are equal to the risks posed by the organisms and/or genes used and not modulated 
          upward by the methods of our project in any conceivable way.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>Training</H2><P>Laboratory safety training is given to undergraduate students in many of their laboratory courses. Specific 
          to bio-safety, three of our team members have completed a comprehensive biological laboratory safety 
          course in their Methods of Modern Biochemistry course (BIOCH 401) This course includes general 
          biological, chemical, and WHMIS safety training). All students including the high school students were 
          given on-site training for the specific techniques they would be using in the laboratory.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>Biosafety Committee</H2><P>As is the case with most universities, there is a local Biosafety Committee on the university of Alberta
          Campus that ensures research labs are following the safety protocols put in place by the national
          government. The University of Alberta Biosafety Committee is a division of the Environmental Health
          and Safety Faculty. This Committee oversees the handling of biohazardous materials and/or techniques, 
          defined as “materials of biological origin or synthetic material which mimic biological entities and may 
          induce adverse conditions to humans, other animals, plants, or the environment”. With respect to 
          relevant national and international guidelines, our non-virulent strains of <I>E. coli</I> are considered 
          Biosafety 
          level 1 and are of limited potential hazard.  Within our lab, standard practices are used, including but 
          not limited to wearing gloves and sterilizing with bleach and/or ethanol and/or autoclaving.  University 
          policy states that the Biosafety committee need only be contacted when risk group level 2 organisms are 
          to be worked with, or for other special concerns, and as such there is currently no need to discuss the 
          project details with them to obtain their approval. However, the EHS provides documents on laboratory 
          guidelines and university-specific ethidium bromide disposal (EHS, 2011), which have been reviewed by 
          the team.</P><P>According to the WHO bio-safety manuscript, the living organisms with which this year’s University of 
          Alberta iGEM team has worked (and will work with) all fall within the category of Risk Level 1, which 
          the manuscript goes on to define as “unlikely to cause human or animal disease”.  Since the strains which
          our team intends to use and has used thus far are harmless (non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic), they all 
          fall into this category and as such, no major safety issues are raised by the biological components of our 
          project.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H2>References:</H2><P><UL><LI>Ethidium bromide – fact sheet. November 2011. <I>Environmental Health &amp; Safety.</I>
