Doesn’t E. coli cause food poisoning? If E. coli is so dangerous, why are they being used in labs?
Normal E. coli colonize the lower intestine of humans, while producing Vitamin K and protecting infection from other harmful bacteria.
Only some strains of E. coli cause food poisoning, but our group is using a harmless,              nonpathogenic strain. This train is engineered to contain mutations that would not allow the E.              coli to survive outside the lab without particular nutrients.
E. coli provides a well-studied and well-known model system to test and troubleshoot new              trials on.

What if plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes were released into the environment despite           precautions?
These genes are used in synthetic biology as selection tools.
There are lower chances of gene uptake by wild bacteria compared to lab-strain bacteria which             have perforated membranes.
In the case that wild bacteria did uptake the antibiotic resistance gene, that gene would             eventually be lost in the population without exposure to the antibiotic, because it is then a              disadvantage for the bacteria to carry the unused plasmids. (Evidence observed in past with the              decline of specific antibiotic resistance after the human population limited that antibiotic).
