Acknowledgement
Our deepest thanks to the following parties, who generously sponsored and supported our cause:
Office of the Provost, HKUST
Office of the Dean of Science, HKUST
Two iGEM teams from the following institutions kindly exchanged information with us and offered reflections on our project:
South University of Science and Technology of China
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
We would very much like to thank the following parties for generously sharing their BioBricks with us. Without their help, we would not be able to complete our devices.
Prof. Malcolm CAMPBELL (Davidson College), who provided us with the plasmid backbone BBa_J176171 .
Dr. Yu ZHANG (Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University and Key Laboratory of Neurodegeneration, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China), who provided us with the plasmid iDUET containing the EF-1alpha promoter we need.
The individuals below participated in our Human Practice Interview and offered much insights for promoting our project beyond academia. We would like to express our great gratitude to:
Prof. Albert YU (Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization, Department of Neurobiology, Peking University)
Prof. Juliana CHAN (The Chinese University of Hong Kong)
We would also like to thank the following individuals from Division of Life Science at our home institute:
Prof. David BANFIELD, who gave us advice on mitochondrial imaging, fixation and staining.
Prof. Raymond S. C. WONG, who taught us much on the biochemistry of fatty acid metabolism.
Prof. King Lun YEUNG, who facilitated our uses of the GC-MS in the Chemistry Department.
Mr. Thomas HUI, from Prof. Karl HERRUP's lab, who shared his experience on cell staining and fixations.
Dr. Siva HUNG and Mr. Hector WANG, who trained us in various tissue culture and staining techniques.
Ms. Julie ANG, who  assisted us in using the confocal microscope and provided valuable feedback on imaging and presentation skills.
And all other members at Professor King L. CHOW's laboratory.
