July 6th, Saturday
A very Tough Weekend (6-8/7)
PCR Native Ko, Native Tf, Sig Tf and Sig Ko was ligated in to Topo Vector.
Many White Colonies were observed. (Also with a few Blue Colonies)
Very HAPPY about the result and picked colonies for culture.
Culture Two Times and Found out the growth rate was abnormally Slow and the Culture was not cloudy and contain
fillament like clusters.
Maybe the ppk gene might be toxic to cell?<< Wrong
Maybe the shaker speed and temperature not correct? << Wrong
WE have Fungus/other bacteria Comtamination!!!
Hints:
Colonies morphology>>very white and not transparent and moist compared to Ecoli colonies
Culture grow well (withou filament clusture) in 32C.
Can grow in Wrong Antibiotics. (Topo vector is Kana resistant, I use Cm to test>Still grow)
Tried to miniprep on tube with less clusters. No Plasmid.
Right Now We don't Know the source of contamination.
Overview:
What we have:
We have EutS, His EutS, Flag EutS in Topo Vector. Positive Digestion Pattern.
Send for sequencing on 9/7.
To avoid comtaminantion.
Will Redo Transformation to create a new stock.
But Right now, we have:
HisEutS 1,2 glycerol stock and streak plates.
FlagEutS 1,2 glycerol stock and streak plates.
(picked colonies from plates and tested postive, but cannot tell whether there is comtamination)
EutS Retransformed plates and glycerol stock.
Previous EutS, His_EutS, Flag_EutS in to 525 vector failed. Will try again.
But we still don't have any ppk in vector!! But have succeed in PCR (But result random)
Cannot Amplify EutSMNLK from K311004. Will send K311004 for sequencing.
