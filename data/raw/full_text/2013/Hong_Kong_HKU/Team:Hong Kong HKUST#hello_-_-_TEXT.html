The HKUST iGEM team 2013 is composed of 15 dedicated undergraduate students. Come and know more about them!
Derek
Derek
Derek is a first year student from Biochemistry undergraduate. He is interested in doing research and want to explore his strength on it.
Funny random things:
ohh did I use the wrong pipette?
Raul
Raul
Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearences and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (don't get him started on synthetic biology!!). His bright future defenitely lies within the walls of a lab!
Funny random things:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!! (Don't ever let him tell you one; if you are a normal person, you'll probably remain traumatized for the rest of your life).
Astrid
Astrid
Astrid is currently in her 2nd year in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology starting from this year. Astrid works in sub group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times until she got a new nickname, "Inoculation girl"! Great, is it? For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.
Funny random things:
** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
And, it is doonnneee! @#$%^&$^#&@
Lindy
Lindy
Lindy is a sophomore majoring in biochemistry and cell biology. Her being a silver medalist in the international biology olympiad probably made you think that biology is her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing...well, everything. Her plans after UST involves earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.
Funny random things:
SacI wastes two weeks of our life!!
Winnie
Winnie
Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST, she would like to try anything new to her. Therefore, she joins iGEM Team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy the lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memory and friendship in iGEM.
Funny random things:
Although there may be failure in the experiment, it is really exciting to see our result come out!
Doyle
Doyle
Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Science student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization related to public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand.
Funny random things:
Doyle sometimes feel envy toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live under no stress and tension unlike his neuron cells in his brain.
Cecilia
Cecilia
Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statics. As a non-biology related student, she only knows a little about synthetic biology. She joined iGEM to explore the mystery of biology. She feels excited to work with a group of passionate and outstanding students and appreciates the help from them.
Funny random things:
LB smells good!
Wilson
Wilson
Wilson is a year 1 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student.             His favourite things to do outside the lab is distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply for being a firefighter, or any other things that he is interested in.
Funny random things:
Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. It seems he has short-circuited.
Lynn
Lynn
As a sophomoric biochemstry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude towards life. She has a good sense of humor that would always make her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursuit further study in US after graduate from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.
Funny random things:
Lynn is in charge of using GCMS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb organic layer together with some water into the tube. That makes the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day's  waiting.
Satien
Satien
Satien Wiliawaty came from Jakarta, Indonesia and born in 1994. This is her second year in UST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, editing, and singing. She join iGEM because she want to learn more about synthetic biology. After UST, she might take further studies in the same field or different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will be happen in the future.
Funny random things:
I loves to eat lunch while waiting for digestion and running the gel.
Wendi
Wendi
Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys play around in lab and is regarded as a potential "hazard" because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plan for future, most probably she'll pursue a master degree abroad.
Funny random things:
Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her do the gel-run along! Nothing will appear on the gel photo...and the gel melts.
Stephy
Stephy
Stephy is a biochemistry student, and now is in her second year in 3-year-program. Stephy is one of graphic design team members, and she mostly spent her weeks in finding the right companies for printing iGEM needs. Stephy is planning to go for further study in America or wherever outside Hong Kong.
Funny random things:
Every Thursday, we have KOR103 course in MBMS lab, which is conducted by our leader, Chloe Eonni! Great, right? We learnt a lot! LOL ;D
