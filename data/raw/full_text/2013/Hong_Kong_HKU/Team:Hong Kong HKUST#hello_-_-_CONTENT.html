His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (don't get him started on synthetic biology!!). His bright future defenitely lies within the walls of a lab!Funny random things:
HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!!

Astrid works in sub group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times until she got a new nickname, &quot;Inoculation girl&quot;! Great, is it? For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.Funny random things:** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
