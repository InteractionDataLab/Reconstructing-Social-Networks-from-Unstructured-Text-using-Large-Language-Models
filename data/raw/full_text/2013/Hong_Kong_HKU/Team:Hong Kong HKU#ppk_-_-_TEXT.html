From 2013.igem.org
By localizing the PPK enzyme into the MCP, the MCP will form a sink for Pi in the system which after normal metabolic uptake by the bacteria is localized to the MCP where it is converted into polyphosphate. As the polyphosphate is too large to pass out of the pores of the MCP, it accumulates in itm preventing phosphate return to the system/ environment. We have two suitable strains for ppk1 gene (Tanneralla forsythia ATCC 43037. 2.Kingella oralis ATCC 51147) in Rory’s lab. We will clone both native genes and signal-fused gene to compare their enzyme activities. Also, the signal-fused ppk1 will be co-expressed with native MCP and tagged MCP (developed from Surface team) to test the localization of enzyme and Pi clearing efficiency.
