This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail. Click here to access our result page for an overview of our achievements with those parts.
How our system works:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
Mitochondrial leader sequence, BBa_K1119001 : for directing proteins to the mitochondria. When the mitochondrial leader sequence is attached, glyoxylate enzymes AceA and AceB can be led into mitochondria to facilitate glyoxylate shunt.
Cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV Promoter), BBa_K1119006 : constitutive mammalian promoter. With the CMV promoter, constitutive expression of the glyoxylate genes aceA and aceB can be realized.
Human Elongation Factor-1alpha promoter (EF-1alpha Promoter), BBa_K1119010 : constitutive mammalian promoter. With the EF-1alpha promoter, constitutive expression of the glyoxylate genes aceA and aceB can be realized.
Data for Pre-existing Parts:
Kozak-XbaI-NLS-6His-Stop, BBa_J176171 (Haynes Lab, 2007): used as a backbone for PfadBA and Pfabp1.
hGH-PolyA, BBa_K404108 (Freiburg Bioware iGEM, 2010): hGH PolyA tail was added after the GFP sequence in the construct of BBa_K1119008 and BBa_K1119009 for characterization of MLS, which gave us the expected results.
GFP BBa_K648013 (Penn-State iGEM, 2011): green fluorescent protein reporter ( BBa_E0040 ) with RFC 25 assembly standard prefix and suffix was used as a reporter for characterization of MLS and the CMV promoter.
We Also Characterized the Following Parts
CMV promoter-GFP, BBa_K1119008 : CMV promoter was assembled with GFP-hGH PolyA. Following transfection of the construct into HEK293FT cells, GFP was successfully expressed.
CMV promoter-Mitochondrial Leader Sequence fused with GFP , BBa_K1119009 : CMV promoter assembled with MLS and GFP-hGH PolyA. Following transfection of the construct into HEK293FT cells, GFP was successfully expressed and directed into mitochondria.
EF-1alpha promoter-GFP, BBa_K1119011 : EF-1alpha promoter was assembled with GFP-hGH PolyA. Following transfection of the construct into HEK293FT cells, GFP was successfully expressed.
