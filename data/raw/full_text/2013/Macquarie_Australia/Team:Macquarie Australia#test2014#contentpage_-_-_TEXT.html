Journal
Check out the journal pages and find out more about our lab adventures this Summer! We kept weekly journals for each component of our project, featuring successful experiments, constructs that didn't feel like working, and memorable moments like our 72-sample SDS page gels, 300-tube Colony PCR and many others.
