Gibson Assembly Protocol
Gibson assembly was employed to combine homologous ends of various gBlocks and PCR fragments based on NEB guidelines.
NOTE: For efficiency with reference to the NEB Gibson protocol, we considered:
1) 0.02–0.2 pmols of DNA fragments when 2 or 3 different fragments were being assembled.
2) 0.2–1 pmols of DNA when 4 to 6 different fragments were being assembled.
A calculation provided was used furthermore to determine the pmols required based on the length of fragments:
pmols = (weight in ng) x 1,000 / (base pairs x 650 daltons)
Legend
* =       50ng of 5000 bp dsDNA is approx 0.015 pmols.
** =   Control reagents
*** =   Additional master mix may be required for larger bp fragments.
Note - 50ng of 500 bp is approx 0.15 pmol
Note - 50-100ng of vector recommended with excess insert of 2-3 fold
Note - Use 5 x more insert if <200bps.
After addition of all components (shown in table) incubation was preformed in a thermocycler at 50°C for 60 min.
