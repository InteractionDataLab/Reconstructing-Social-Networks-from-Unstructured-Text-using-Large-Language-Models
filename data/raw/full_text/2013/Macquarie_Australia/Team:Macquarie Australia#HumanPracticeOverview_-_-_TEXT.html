Human Practice Overview
The Macquarie University Team had a significant portion of our project and time spend on developing our Human Practice, by targeting multiple areas in the community in a variety of different methods. Our aims were to educate society on the potential of synthetic biology, clarify the differences between genetic engineering and synthetic biology and to dispel any myths of synthetic biology being a dangerous field which is harmful to society. Synthetic Biology has applications in a variety of fields with massive potential to solve problems in society including pollution and energy. This page acts as a central hub for all of our aspects of Human Practice and contains a small description of the work. To learn more about our aspects in greater depth click on the headings.
Human Practices Achievements
Highlights of our achievements
                                   
• The iGem team presented and WON the prize for Best Presentation in Plant Science or Molecular Biology at the 2nd Australian Conference of Undergraduate Research.
• The 2013 iGem team along with our advisor, Yagis Alp Aksoy, set up the FIRST Macquarie University based synthetic biology group called SynBioNet to which we aim to expand internationally.
• The iGem team along with our instructor Dr. Louise Brown, organisated of FIRST Synthetic Biology Workshop in Australia which aims to highlight the importance of Synthetic Biology to the Australian Academic community and encourage other Australian teams to participate.
• Our collaborative approach involved providing mentoring assistance for Sydney University iGEM team who were participating for the first time in iGEM and assisted the team in their ‘Strange Nature’ creative writing competition.
• On Macquarie University Open Day the iGem team organised a range of laboratory activities for people to actively engage in was conducted and a record-high turnout resulted.
• The iGem team educated students at a variety of levels, a 2nd year university lecture and a workshop at two different high schools for senior students. A question based on the lecture content was designed and integrated into the students mid-term exam.
                                   
Education
Workshop and Lecture
To educate students at a variety of levels, a 2nd year university lecture and a workshop at two different high schools for senior students was conducted.
• In the university lecture, students with prior knowledge of genetic engineering were introduced to the field of synthetic biology. The  concept of the ‘BioBrick’ and the importance of the Gibson Assembly technique was highlighted.
• A question based on the lecture content was designed and integrated into the students mid-term exam .
• In the school workshops, the fundamentals of molecular biology and a basic introduction into synthetic biology were given.
• Theory was supported with hands-on activities which allowed students and iGEM mentors to communicate effectively and answer any questions asked.
Open Day
Macquarie University Open Day
• Macquarie University Open Day attracts a broad audience, ranging from children of all ages to potential students and adults of all ages.
• We found this platform to be an ideal opportunity to further extend awareness and education of synthetic biology and the importance of our project.
• We conducted a range of laboratory activities for people to actively engage in and a record-high turnout resulted.
Public Conference
Organisation of First Synthetic Biology Workshop in Australia
• Australian universities participation in the international iGEM project has significantly decreased over time. However, Macquarie University’s participation has remained consistent since 2010.
• We aim to highlight the importance of Synthetic Biology to the Australian Academic community and, more importantly, educate other Australian Universities as to how they also can participate in the iGEM competition. Our long term  hopes are to  increase the participation of Australian University teams in iGEM and eventually host an Oceania iGEM Jamboree event.
Collaboration Project
Strange Nature- SydneyUni_Australia iGEM team
• Our collaborative approach involved providing mentoring assistance for Sydney University iGEM team who were participating for the first time in iGEM. We provided mentoring to them during the initial stages of this competition.
• Macquarie University also cooperated with Sydney University by contacting potential judges for the ‘Strange Nature’ creative writing competition. We also publicised this initiative to English and Science Departments at Australian High Schools to provide as many high school students as possible with the opportunity to participate.
Undergraduate Conference
Prize Winner! At the 2nd Australian Conference of Undergraduate Research
• This International Conference aims to share research done by undergraduate students from one discipline amongst all disciplinary areas. This provided us with the opportunity to present our current work and achievements.
• We received positive feedback in response to our presentation and consequently, we were awarded with the Best Presentation in Plant Science or Molecular Biology.
• Our peers and the public demonstrated great enthusiasm towards our project and, in particular, its future prospects for ‘Green Energy’.
Synthetic Society
SynBioNet
• The 2013 iGem team advisor, Yagis Alp Aksoy, set up a Macquarie University based synthetic biology group called SynBioNet to which we aim to expand internationally within 2 years.
• This society aims to to build a network to connect people who are interested in synthetic biology and enabling technologies.
Safety
Safety Questions & Quarantine
Dealing with new synthetic parts and systems, it is important to understand the safety concerns and responsibility required when synthetic constructs. To take this into consideration we looked at potential safety threats and safety issues revolving around our project and ways to minimize risk.
• Throughout our project we worked with Risk Group I organisims (i.e. E.coli). Risk Group I organisims demonstrate no risks associated with humans.
• The intermediates created by enzymes were all reguated by 5'-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) from the chlorophyll pathway, a mechanism within E.coli. These enzymes used do not pose any danger to humans.
