Macquarie University Synthetic Biology Society
The 2013 iGem team advisor, Yagiz Alp Aksoy, established a Macquarie University based
synthetic biology group called SynBioNet to which we aim to expand internationally within 2 years.
This society aims to build a network to connect people who are interested in synthetic biology
and enabling technologies.
