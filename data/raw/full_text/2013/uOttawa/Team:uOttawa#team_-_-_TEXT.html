Whatsup y'all! I'm Wilson Lam, and to date, I have had the privilege of being a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team for three years. I'm currently studying towards the awesomeness that is an Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. This year, I was named the President of the team, and I cannot be more proud of what we have been able to accomplish this year. We have collected an incredible group of people on the team, and I'm proud to be a part of a group of such hardworking synthetic biologists. Feel free to follow my ramblings @1MaginAZN!
My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!
My name is Dylan Siriwardena, however the question of who I am is a much more complicated question. Since it would take far too long for you (the reader) to glean an understanding of my very soul, I shall limit myself to the superficial. I am a third year Biology student, and I am currently working in the wet lab for this year's iGEM team. Being my first year in iGEM, I am excited to be a part of such a large international competition. My interests include rollerblading, history, martial arts, and hair care. I'm hoping to make a living somewhere in the field of Biology.
Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship.
