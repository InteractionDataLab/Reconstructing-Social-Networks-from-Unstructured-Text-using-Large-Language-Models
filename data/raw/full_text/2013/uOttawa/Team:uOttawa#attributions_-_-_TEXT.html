Wet Lab Software Human Practices Design Sponsors
Members of the wet lab undergraduate team, Wilson Lam, Dylan Siriwardena, Lloyd Mai, and Yara Abou-Hamde, built all network constructs along with the submitted BioBrick parts. Martin Hanzel built constructs designed to test an ethanol-inducible promoter and a copper-inducible promoter. Richard Beard built constructs to test functionality of chromoproteins. Dylan, Lloyd, Wilson and Yara handled yeast and E. coli transformations. Wilson and Yara ran flow cytometry.
Wilson Lam accomplished the overall network design with advice provided by team advisors Afnan Azizi and Ian Roney. The lab advisors also contributed to the day-to-day troubleshooting and helped in the training of the undergraduate team. Our lab technician, Mila Tepliakova, assisted in the safety training of the undergraduate team and provided advice throughout the progression of the project. Dr. Mads Kaern provided the team with lab resources and extensive advice and support.
The differential equations model for the system and implementation in MATLAB were done by Paul Reginato from the University of Waterloo iGEM team. This was only possible as a result of the great collaboration between the University of Waterloo iGEM team and the uOttawa iGEM teams learn more . Parameterization and analysis of the model to show pulse and fold change detection were done by Nicolas Tremblay from the University of Ottawa iGEM team with extensive guidance of Daniel Charlebois advisor for the uOttawa iGEM team. Martin Hanzel did the bulk of the work on the team Wiki with some assistance from the design team.
Bricklayer was built by Kevin Rutkay, Peter Doan, Martin Hanzel, and Mohammed Chamma. Mohammed designed the architecture and wrote the search feature using Parts Registry's API. Peter implemented the RFCs, the primer generation code, and the melting temperature calculations. Kevin created the Brick Bin, adding the ability to select and save bricks that will make up the user's final construct. Martin designed the look and feel of the app's search, results, bin, and construction interfaces. Many thanks to the wet lab team, especially Dylan and Wilson, for sitting with the dry lab and explaining the biology to us.
Mr. Cool’s Microscopic Adventures  was written by undergraduates Daniel Tesolin, Katie Harriman, Michael Xiang, Alexandra Huluta, Caitlin Johnston, Nicholas Huang, Marina Kidisyuk, Abdus Subhan Anwar, Curtis Quan, Amir Hamid, Kaitlin Kharas, Shihad Sarwar, Irene Harmsen, Meshach David, Rizwan Awan, and Fiatsgobe Dzuali. Editors of the book include undergraduates Huy Tran and Cory Lefebvre.
Book design was also completed by undergraduate Cory Lefebvre. The undergraduates Dina Yazji and Leona Yiu completed all illustrations for Mr. Cool’s Microscopic Adventures.
In-class workshops and assessments were completed by undergraduates Caitlin Johnston, Katie Harriman, Nicholas Huang, and Curtis Quan.
All aspects of the project related to artistic design including the children's book, poster, wiki, presentation, brochure, and logo were created by the undergraduate students on the team without the contribution of any third parties. All illustrations in the children's book were drawn by Dina Yazji and Leona Yiu. The children's book design and publishing was done by Cory Lefebvre. The designs for the T-shirt, logo and poster were done by Huy Tran. The presentation and brochure designs were done by Cory Lefebvre.
