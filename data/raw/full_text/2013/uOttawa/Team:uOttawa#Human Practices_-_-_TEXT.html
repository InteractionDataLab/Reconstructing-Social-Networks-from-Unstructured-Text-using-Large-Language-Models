Mr. Cool's Microscopic Adventures
Mr. Cool's Microscopic Adventures is a children's book written by the 2013 uOttawa iGEM Team. The narrative follows the life of synthetic biologist Mr. Cool, as he attempts to save the microscopic residents of YeastVille from the dire situations of an oil spill and a few unwelcome guests, among other disasters. The book is targeted to an audience of children from the ages of 6-10, and explains the basics of synthetic biology in language that the children can understand. The book will be published in hard copy, as an eBook, and also as an audiobook.
