I'm Wilson Lam, and to date, I have had the privilege of being a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team for three years. I'm currently studying towards the awesomeness that is an Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. This year, I was named the President of the team, and I cannot be more proud of what we have been able to accomplish this year. We have collected an incredible group of people on the team, and I'm proud to be a part of a group of such hardworking synthetic biologists. Feel free to follow my ramblings @1MaginAZN!</P></DIV><DIV class="three columns bio"><P>My name is Yara Abou-Hamde and I will be starting my third year of university this fall. I am studying Biomedical Science with an Option in Medicinal Chemistry. Science is a huge part of who I am and it has been a truly exceptional experience working in the lab as part of iGEM this year. I learned so much about synthetic biology, scientific research and communication as it relates to a research environment. My colleagues and I have worked incredibly hard and I am grateful for both collective and individual efforts. I look forward to competing and meeting fellow iGEM teams!</P></DIV><DIV class="three columns bio"><P>My name is Dylan Siriwardena, however the question of who I am is a much more complicated question. Since it would take far too long for you (the reader) to glean an understanding of my very soul, I shall limit myself to the superficial. I am a third year Biology student, and I am currently working in the wet lab for this year's iGEM team. Being my first year in iGEM, I am excited to be a part of such a large international competition. My interests include rollerblading, history, martial arts, and hair care. I'm hoping to make a living somewhere in the field of Biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="three columns bio"><P>Martin Hanzel is starting his first year in Biomedical Science, and is involved in uOttawa's iGEM team as part of his Undergrad Research Scholarship.
