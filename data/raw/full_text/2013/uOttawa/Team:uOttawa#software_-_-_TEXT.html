Bricklayer: the ultimate DNA assembly tool
The BrickLayer software is a web-based application that allows teams to virtually engineer their DNA constructs and design primers for the construction of their engineered parts - all in one place. Users can query and select parts from the BioBrick database, and design a construct with their chosen parts. BrickLayer will automatically create the primers necessary to build the chosen construct using the user’s choice of compatible assembly method and melting temperature range, among other optional parameters.
