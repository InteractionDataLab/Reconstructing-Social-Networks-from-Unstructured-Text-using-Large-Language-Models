Boris Dyakov
Boris is a 3rd year student studying cell and molecular biology. He was our lab manager this summer and was too busy doing work to really put much thought into this section. His hobbies include cooking and repairing bikes.
Fun fact: he has his pilots license!
Adam Komorowski
Adam is currently completing his third year; he is a double major in Immunology, as well as Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. This is Adam's second year with the UofT iGEM team, in which he filled the role of President.
Michael Yu
In biological sciences I am interested in ab initio protein structure prediction, because it is a hard problem that hasn’t been fully solved and I like hard problems. At home I like to cook and not do the dishes afterwards, because the first is tasty and the second is boring so I procrastinate. When I get bored I either read a book, or go on my computer to build ahistorical countries in the historical game Europa Universalis 4, or just go buy beer.
Monica Akula
I am a neuroscience major with a 4.3 GPA. My interests include mathematics and genetics. In my barely existent spare time I do slave labour for others.
Alejandro Duque
Third year undergraduate majoring in both Biotechnology and Molecular Genetics & Microbiology. First year involved in the iGEM Toronto team. Focused on the risk assessment and biosafety of our biofilm project.
Cathy Su
I am a biophysics specialist who is especially interested in working on epigenetics. I'd like to cure myopia within the next quarter century.
Seemi
Seemi is completing her second year as a Global Health and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology major, as well as a Psychology minor.
Abdiwahab Moalim
I am a third year undergraduate student in Cell Biology and Physiology. In science, my interests lie in many fields but especially in the spaces between them. In fact I have just reached a breakthrough in my super top secret research bridging all fields that will change the world and I can't wait to tell you! But hey, look over there - fourth sentence!

He is an Associate Professor at the University of Toronto, and is cross-appointed to the Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. He serves as the director of the Specialist programme in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Boris completed both his MD and PhD at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in München (Munich), Germany. Boris' post-doctoral work was completed under Nobel laureate Robert Huber at the Max-Planck-Institut für Biochemie in Martinsreid, Germany.
Kristina Han
Kristina Han is the principal graduate student advisor for the UofT iGEM team. Kristina is completing her PhD at the University of Toronto in the lab of Prof. James Rini at the Department of Biochemistry. The award for Outstanding TA was given to Kristina by the Department of Biochemistry in 2012.
