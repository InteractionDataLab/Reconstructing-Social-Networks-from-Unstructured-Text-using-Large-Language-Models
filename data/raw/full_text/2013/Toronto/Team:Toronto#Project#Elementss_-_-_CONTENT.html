Using the EcoCyc database as a reference we developed a regulatory map of any genes we could find related to biofilms. This map helped us identify key regulatory genes that we expected would affect the eventual phenotypic output of the biofilm; either by virtue of being a deletion strain or by the genetic element being overexpressed through our pEBS + {target gene} transformed strains. Listed below are the deletion and transformed strains we assayed along with their expected phenotypes.</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B>BW25113 Wild Type (Weak Biofilm Response Control)</B><B>MG1655 Wild Type (Strong Biofilm Response Control)</B><B>BW25113 pEBS-csgD</B>
Regulator of genes involved in curli assembly; it is induced in 
mid-exponential phase, allowing csg-dependent genes to become activated in stationary phase. [1] <B>BW25113 pEBS-fimB</B>The gene fimB mediates off to on switching of fim operon, while fimE mediates on to off switching of the fim operon. Its deletion should in principle repress the fim operon, while its overexpression should in principle encourage fimbriae formation. [2]<B>BW25113 pEBS-mlrA</B>MlrA stands for a merR-like regulator A, which regulates curli production. Its overexpression should in principle suppress curli formation, while its deletion should in principle encourage curli formation. [3]<B>BW25113 pEBS-ompA </B>The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by 
repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is 
overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to 
visible light. [4]<B>BW25113 pEBS-ydeH </B>YdeH is a diguanylate cyclase, whose product is c-di-GMP.
c-di-GMP regulates both biofilm formation and motility. YdeH deletion has been shown to reduce 
surface attachment of the cell, while its overexpression has been shown to reduce 
motility as well as flagella. [5]<B>BW25113 ΔfimA </B>FimA is the major subunit of <I>E. coli</I> type 1 (mannose 
sensitive) fimbriae, also known as pili. Pili are made of ~1000 units of FimA. Its 
deletion would remove the ability of a cell to produce fimbriae.[6]<B>BW25113 ΔompA</B>The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by 
repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is 
overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to

Its overexpression drives the cell towards stationary phase physiology, 
leading to more biofilm and less motility. DosC expression is dependent on <TT>σ<SUB>S</SUB></TT>
.[7]<B>BW25113 ΔompX </B>Adhesion of the cell on a surface represses ompX. Its 
deletion leads to increase in cell-surface contact in fimbriated E. coli, the 
opposite occurs in non-fimbriated E. coli.[8]<B> BW25113 ΔpgaB</B>PgaB is involved in the transport of PGA – an 
extramembrane polysaccharide – across the outer membrane. PGA is involved in the formation of biofilm: pgaB mutants form less biofilm. Its expression is
increased in environments with 1% ethanol or NaCl. [9] <B>BW25113 ΔrcsA </B>+ Regulator of capsular polysaccharide synthesis. RcsA 
and RcsB form a DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator. Deletion of this 
gene should in principle cause some repression of extracellular 
polysaccharides.[10]<B>BW25113 ΔfimH</B>FimH is the protein on the tip of fimbriae; they are the

We looked at the effect of various stimuli on the polysaccharides, proteins, and structures 
involved in the various stages of a biofilm. In particular, we looked at varying concentrations of 
nutrients, physical environments, and media.
For nutrients, we chose three levels of stimulation – zero stimulation, medium stimulation, and 
maximum stimulation. Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed 
through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.
The stimuli were administered and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 (±3) hours at 23 
degrees Celsius, which is the optimum temperature for biofilm growth (White-Ziegler et al. 2008).
As bacteria turn their environment acidic as a result of anaerobic metabolism, buffered LB was 
used using the phosphate salts, potassium phosphate monobasic and potassium phosphate 
dibasic. pH 7 was adjusted for using 0.1 M concentration in Luria Broth. The E. coli cells were 
incubated in buffered LB to maintain pH 7 and eliminate the extraneous variable of acidity. The 
stock solutions for the stimuli were also created in buffered LB to prevent uneven nutrient levels;
the phosphate salts are a systematic error across all inoculations and can thus be ignored.
In continuation with the project, we are planning to optimize results by combining the treatments
which give the best results. </P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Ethanol</U></B>
Reasoning:
Given the large quantity of literature on the effect of ethanol on biofilm, it is a very important 
stimulus. The ethanol concentrations being tested in this experiment are 0.53% and 2%. 
Cegelskiet al. (2012) found that the level of some proteins involved in biofilm formation 
increases in the presence of ethanol. They also found UT189 strain colonies to be 55% larger 
(colony morphology assay). Cell viability is compromised at concentrations exceeding 4%.
Materials for Ethanol stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
•40% EtOH solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B>Protocol:</B>
1. Grow overnight culture of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
2. Add 200 <TT>µ</TT>L of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 <TT>µ</TT>L of 1.6% EtOH in 
buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final EtOH concentration of
1%.
3. Add 200 <TT>µ</TT>L of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 <TT>µ</TT>L of 6% EtOH 
in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of 
2%.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;"><B>Carbon Source</B></P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Sucrose</U></B>
Reasoning:
The concentrations of sucrose being tested are 0.5 M and 0.1 M. Hagiwara et al. (2009) found 
the growth curves to show optimum biofilm at a 0.1 M concentration. <I>E. coli</I> biofilm formation 
decreases at high osmolarity - sucrose is being used here to test osmolarity as a non-ionic solute.
Materials for sucrose stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
• 2 M sucrose stock solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight cultures in phosphate buffered media.
2. Add 200 <TT>µ</TT>L of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 <TT>µ</TT>L of 
0.3% sucrose solution made in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain
a final concentration of 0.1 M.
3. Add 200 <TT>µ</TT>L of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 <TT>µ</TT>L of 
1.5% sucrose in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final 
concentration of 0.5 M.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

Reasoning:
Indole has an overall negative effect on biofilm. The concentrations being tested are 500 micromolar and 300
micromolar.
Materials:
• 0.0009 M Indole in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. 300 <TT>µ</TT>M  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was inoculated in buffered LB.  b. 200 <TT>µ</TT>l of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 <TT>µ</TT>l of 0.0009 M indole was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius. 
2. 500 <TT>µ</TT>M  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 <TT>µ</TT>l of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 <TT>µ</TT>l of 0.0015 M was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius.

</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>DMSO</U></B>
Reasoning:
Effects are similar to that of ethanol. The levels of certain proteins that regulate biofilm 
formation were 3-3.9 times higher than baseline, and there was an increase in curli (Lim et al., 
2012). The concentrations being tested are 4% and 2%.
Materials list:
• Dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. 2%  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 <TT>µ</TT>l of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 <TT>µ</TT>l of 6% DMSO was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius. 
2. 4%  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 <TT>µ</TT>l of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 <TT>µ</TT>l of 12% DMSO was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius

Reasoning:
The concentrations being tested are 0.3 M and 0.5 M. NaCl is being tested for its effect as an osmolite in medium. 
Park et al. (2012) found NaCl-free to increase attachment and the capacity of biofilm formation 
under salt (0.1-0.3 M) was similar to that of the control. Zogaj et al. (2001) says that the bcs
genes were expressed under 0.5 M - it is unclear whether that is similar to the levels found in the 
wild type strain.
Materials:
• Phosphate buffered LB without NaCl
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. Sodium chloride free Luria Broth  a. 275 <TT>µ</TT>l of NaCl-free LB was added to the well.  b. 25 <TT>µ</TT>l of overnight culture was added to the well.  c. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius.

Reasoning:
Verma et al. (2010) found most biofilm to be produced at 37 degrees in TSB media.
Materials:
• TSB media
• Overnight culture

4. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees.</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Phosphate buffered Luria Broth</U></B>
Reasoning:
To prevent fluctuations in pH as cell growth progresses, phosphate buffered Luria Broth media is
used in place of regular LB.
Materials:
• Phosphate buffered LB
• overnight culture
Protocol:
1. 275 <TT>µ</TT>l of buffered Luria Broth was added to the well.
2. 25 <TT>µ</TT>l of overnight culture was added to the well.
3. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees.</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Unbuffered Luria Broth</U></B>
Reasoning:
The regular recipe for LB was used and this was used to establish a baseline to compare all other 
media.
Materials:
• LB  o 10 g NaCl/L <SUP>dd</SUP>H<SUP>2</SUP>O  o 5 g yeast extract/L <SUP>dd</SUP>H<SUP>2</SUP>O  o 10 Tryptone/L <SUP>dd</SUP>H<SUP>2</SUP>O

3. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Acidic Luria Broth (0.5 M potassium phosphate monobasic)</U></B>
Reasoning:
Acidic conditions are one set of stimuli that increase levels of a protein that normally increases 
motility and decreases the biofilm response.
Materials:
• Acidic buffered LB  o 0.5 M Potassium Phosphate Monobasic
• Overnight culture
Protocol:
1. 275 <TT>µ</TT>l of acidic LB was added to the well.
