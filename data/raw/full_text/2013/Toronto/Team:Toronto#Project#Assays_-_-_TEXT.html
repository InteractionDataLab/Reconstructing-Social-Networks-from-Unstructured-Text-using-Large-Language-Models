Assay Protocols
This page describes the assay protocols for each genotype and stimulus. These assays were chosen because we wanted to assess the biofilm phenotype thoroughly as well as evaluate the components of the biofilm that are most critical towards the transition to the sedentary lifestyle. Our battery of assays contains assays to assess overall biofilm development: Crystal violet, Aggregation and Adhesion assays. However we also examine curli expression with the Congo Red assay, cellulose expression with the Congo Red and Calcofluor assays, Exopolysaccharide expression with the Colanic Acid assay and fimbriae expression with the Yeast Agglutination assay.
Input into these assays are a series of microtiter wells with a culture volume of 300 μL and phosphate buffered LB as the reference medium.
In terms of a qualitative biofilm assay, our petri dish-based Colony Morphology assay assesses the appearance, colour and texture of E. Coli colonies subject to varying stimuli.
Cell density
Principle: OD600 is used as a surrogate for number of cells.
Materials:
       •Plate reader
       •96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Measure OD600 for the entire plate of cultures in the micrometer plate  reader.
Aggregation
Principle: Measure cell density in culture below surface, aggregated cells will have  sunk to the bottom of the well.
Materials
       •Plate reader
       •96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Remove 150 μL of culture volume from overnight culture plates.
       2. Place it into the empty microtiter well, at the edge of the plate. To prevent  bubble formation, make sure to stop pipetting at the first stop.
       3. Measure OD600
Crystal violet
Principle: Crystal violet binds to polysaccharides of the biofilm matrix. By measuring the binding to adhering biofilm, the amount of biofilm produced can be quantified. A stock solution of crystal violet is incubated with the culture, the supernatant is  removed, bound crystal violet is mobilised with an ethanol:acetone solution and the  absorption is determined.
Materials:
       •Crystal Violet stock solution: To make 1L, add 0.3 g of crystal violet to a bottle and fill to 1L with double distilled water. Stir well. Store at room temperature  till usage.
       •1400 μl double distilled water
       •350 μL 80:20 ethanol:acetone stock solution
       •96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Wash wells of overnight culture by removing well contents and pipetting in  350 μl of double distilled water.
       2. Aspirate immediately by touching pipette to the side of the plate.
       3. Add 350 μL of CV stock solution to well.
       4. Incubate for 30 min. at room temperature.
       5. Aspirate all of the liquid.
       6. Repeat 350 μl double distilled water wash 3 times. Make sure to empty the  well completely on the last wash.
       7. Add 350 μL of 80:20 ethanol:acetone solution.
       8. Incubate for 15 min. while gently shaking.
       9. Transfer the entire amount to an empty well on the microtiter plate.
       10.Measure absorbance at 600 nm.
Agglutination
Principle:Fimbriae bind mannose. Yeast cells display mannose molecules on their  cell surface and can be induced to visibly clump together with E. coli cells that  express functional fimbriae under the specific culture conditions.
Materials:
       • Mortar and pestle
       • Prepare the stock solution (yeast slurry) fresh on the day of measurement:
       Add half a teaspoon of Fleischmann's yeast granules.
       Using a mortar, grind the yeast to powder form. Add 500mg of yeast powder in 5mL of 10% PBS.
       • 96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Add 60 μL of the yeast slurry with 300 μL of overnight culture into well.
       2. Mix briefly using a micropipette.
       3. Score agglutination after 5 minutes on a scale of "–" to "+++", based on http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603005916

       • 1:1000 dilution of Sigma Antifoam A
       • 96-well plate with clear bottom
Procedure:
       1. Aspirate overnight culture volumes from wells.
       2. Add 100 μl of EtBr stock solution.
       3. Measure fluorescence with λex 510 nm / λem 595 nm.

       1. Add 455 μL of cell culture into a clean PCV tube. Parafilm the opening.
       2. Spin at 4,000 RCF for 2 min.
       3. Note length of the packed cell column according to the graduations of the  capillary.
       4. Packed cell volume is expressed as a value per OD600.
Colony Morphology
Reasoning:
The dyes in the agar plates will differentially stain cells based on whether or not they produce  curli and cellulose (Nakhamchik 2008). Bacteria that exclusively express curli will bind to the  congo red and will form red colonies, whereas bacteria that express only cellulose will form blue colonies. If both are expressed, purple colonies will be formed. Rough colonies are indicative of  curli formation. In the below photograph, there is more variation in colour at 23°C (picture on the left) than at 37°C, reflecting the protein expression phenotypes that are accessible  at the lower temperature. This is the reason the former temperature was chosen to incubate  colony morphology plates.

Materials
       • LB Agar with 40 µg/mL Congo Red dye and 20 µg/mL Brilliant Blue dye
       • Petri dishes
       • Antibiotic
       • Inoculation loop for streaking
Protocol
       1. Prepare phosphate-buffered LB Agar containing 40 µg/mL Congo Red dye and 20 µg/mL Brilliant Blue dye along with appropriate antibiotic.
       2. Prepare overnight cultures of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
       3. To save plates, divide each plate into 4 quarters using a lab marker or use a whole plate.  Streak out bacteria from overnight culture using an inoculation loop.
       4. Incubate in darkness at 23°C for 48 h.
       5. Assess colony morphology.
Congo Red
Reasoning:
CR binds to curli and cellulose. The difference between the blank CR absorbance and absorbance of the supernatant taken after centrifugation will be proportional to the amount of CR by our  substrates of interest.
Nakhamchik A., Wilde C, Dean A. Rowe-Magnus (2008). Curli Fibers Are Highly Conserved  between Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with Respect to Operon Structure and  Regulation.J. Bacteriol,vol. 180 no. 3,722-731.
W. E. Klunk, R. F. Jacob, and R. P. Mason, “Quantifying amyloid by congo red spectral shift  assay,” Methods in Enzymology, vol. 309, pp. 285–305, 1999.
Materials for Congo Red:
       • 0.5 mM CR solution in ddH2O
       • Antifoam A concentration
       • 96-well plate with clear bottom
       • Microcentrifuge tubes
       • Centrifuge
       • Absorbance plate reader
Protocol
       1. To a 0.5 mM Congo red (CR) in ddH2O, add 15 μL of Antifoam A concentrate per 100  mL (final concentration 10ppm per well on 96-well plate) to prevent bubbles while  pipetting.
       2. Pipette 200 μL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture grown in phosphate buffered LB  into 96-well plate well.
       3. Add 100 μL of phosphate buffered LB.
       4. Incubate for 48 h at 23°C in darkness.
       5. Add 20 μL of the 0.5 mM Congo red solution to well containing bacteria grown for 48 h.
       6. Pipette 150 μL of CR into another well for a blank measurement (the “blank CR” well).
       7. Incubate for 60 min.
       8. Transfer 200 μL into microcentrifuge tube.
       9. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 30 seconds.
       10.Transfer 150 μL to an empty well on the microtiter plate.
       11.Measure absorbance at 490 nm.
       12.Subtract absorbance value from absorbance value of the“blank CR”. This will give you  the amount of bound CR.
Calcofluor
Reasoning:
CF binds to cellulose. The difference between the blank CF fluorescence and fluorescence of the  supernatant taken after centrifugation will be proportional to the amount of CF bound by our  substrates of interest.
Nakhamchik A., Wilde C, Dean A. Rowe-Magnus (2008). Curli Fibers Are Highly Conserved  between Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with Respect to Operon Structure and  Regulation.J. Bacteriol,vol. 180 no. 3,722-731.
