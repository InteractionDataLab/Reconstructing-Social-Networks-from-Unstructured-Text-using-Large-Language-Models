The iGEM Toronto team has come up with a novel approach to lab safety which takes the form of situational exercises giving users real accident simulation as opposed to the conventional method of reading safety manuals and writing follow-up quizzes. This method has been adapted from paramedic and lifeguarding training. We would be delighted to have you try these out and give us your feedback.
