05/26
Prepared stock solution of LB and autoclaved empty bottles.
05/27
Prepared antibiotic aliquots and practiced pouring a gel.
05/28
Practiced dilution plating and glass bead plating. Worked collaboratively on a miniprep  and used Nanodrop to evaluate the DNA purity.
Met with Michael to talk about lambda red recombination. He is trying to make his own  deletion strains with a pKD46 plasmid, recombinases, and PCR. Researched plasmid  map of pBR322 to determine key characteristics like antibiotic resistance, origin of  replication etc.
05/29
Learned how to use the incubator with shaker and how to operate the Moraes lab  Thermocycler and Spectrophotometer (details uploaded to Wiki).  Also investigated the ideal rbs sequence for our genes. According to From Genes to  Clones, the rbs should be 4-9bp upstream of ATG. It's stronger if you add adenines  upstream of the RBS and it comes before minor genes in an operon. If we're interested  in operon expression we must keep the stoichiometric balance of each minor gene by  preserving the native rbs sequences.
05/30
Project Milestones are established:
1. Primer design with pMal vector.
2. Amplification and cloning of genes
3. Establishing selection and cultivation conditions with assays and stimuli
Sub-goals within each step were established as well. Prepared glycerol for inoculation  and streaking. Lab members were assigned stimuli/assays to do and today we made a  list of the ingredients from these protocols which we didn't have.  Designed primers for CsgD after establishing RBS and other sequences.
06/01
Crystal violet assay – Discussed the different procedures for this with Afiq and Seemi.
06/02
First round of crystal violet protocols established.
06/03
Edited primers.
06/05
New cloning strategy introduced by Kristina: InFusion by Clontech. Worked to redesign  primers for this purpose.15bp homology required between each insert. Prepared M63 minimal media.
06/06
Made a culture of MG1655 from a plate Michael brought over from BioZone for the  purpose of making competent cells. Edited primers.
06/07
Learned to determine OD600 of growing MG culture by diluting. Made agar and 10% glycerol from 40% stock. Poured plates and streaked the little tabs  that the deletions came in on top of each plate by suspending in sterile LB medium.  Strains were incubated at 7 PM.
06/09
Made liquid cultures of each deletion strain so we can have glycerol stocks. Got trained  on microscope.
06/12
In order to wrap up primer design, Dr. Steipe instructed us on how to make the RBS  overlap, checked over the PCR product schema, and suggested a double stop codon.  Re-established goals for the project and reviewed stimuli and assays.  Booked equipment training with Artur in the Division of Teaching Labs so we can start  trying the ELIZA and spectrophotometer downstairs.
06/13
Made a list of strains to be tested for biofilm proteins. Incubated MG1655 at room temperature without shaking. Prepared for crystal violet  assays with ethanol, temperature and salt stimuli on clear plates
06/14
Artur trained us to use the ELIZA and Titrek Multiscan spectrophotometer.  Made stock solutions of NaCl+LB at varying concentrations, 50mM-350mM.
06/16
Pairing Stimuli with Assays – Organized a chart of stimuli variations matched with  Assays for the different proteins of interest. Ran a sample crystal violet with MG1655  and realized that readings are not noticeably different from each other. Made 400g/L  PEG solution for osmolarity stimuli and ordered ingredients for yeast media.  Grew WT cultures overnight at 250 RPM.
06/17
Pipetted CV plates with varying salt concentrations. Made more salt-free medium and  made stock CR.  Amount of ethanol that needs to be pipetted for each stimulus treatment was  calculated for 100% ethanol. The amount didn't work, since less than 1 microL  was required for some. Thus, 70% ethanol was decided upon. Plate maps were  drawn for osmolarity (using PEG-4000) and ethanol stress stimuli. CR solution  was made.
06/18
Prepared ethanol assay with MG1655 and BW25113. Prepared LB agar plates for  colony morphology assay. Prepared yeast media (YPD) and 20% glucose solution for  time to yeast agglutination assay.
06/19
To prepare for CR assay, we diluted overnight culture to OD600=1 and did the CR  protocol with the prepared culture. OD480 absorbance was taken for BW and MG.
06/20
The PEG & Ethanol crystal violet assay was conducted again.
06/21
Made liquid overnight cultures of E. coli MG1655 and BW25113.
06/22
Inoculated motility and Colony morphology plates. Made wet mounts of cultures to observe yeast (which seem to aggregate at bottom of  tube). Made more YPD. Having trouble getting the spec to make sensible OD600 measurements when diluting  culture.
06/23
Prepared a 1:100 dilution of overnight culture and made motility plates. Used  microscope to visualize bacteria using Koehler illumination. Made notes on colony  morphology results i.e. the criteria on which to judge the colonies e.g. form, elevation,  etc. Dr. Steipe suggests to validate CV by measuring OD600 throughout the growth stages,  tapping hard into the bench for the washing step, putting more CV inside, and  randomizing wells. He also suggests a swarm plate recipe with 'liquid agar'.  We must first dilute our samples to OD<1 as the instrument is less accurate at high  optical densities.
06/24
Meeting: CV protocol was improved on and data from the absorbance readings was  analyzed using Excel. Looked up protocols for Ag43 assay. Yeast were obtained from the Meneghini lab and streaked onto YPD plates, then  incubated O/N. The protocol for time to yeast agglutination was copied down.
06/25
Prepared swarm/motility plates with tryptone broth agar (TBA). Prepared motility assay  samples for BW25113.
06/26
Prepared frozen stocks of yeast by inoculating them. Prepared swarming agar for  motility assays. Pipetted another stimuli plate using OD600 = 1 cultures. Prepared cellulose assay  (brilliant blue and congo red) plates. Made glycerol stocks of E. coli with pKD46, pKD3.
06/27
Incubated plates for motility assay, prepares OD600=1 culture for yeast agglutination  assay, and repeated CR assay. Finished pipetting CV sodium stimuli plates at 10 PM  and covered from light; grew overnight cultures. The colony morphology assay was  performed. The colony morphology assay protocol was written out. A fresh 96-well plate was  pipetted into according to a new plate design for the osmolarity and sodium  assay. M9 salts have NaCl, but the effects are likely small of the amount of salt  present in M9 salts in regular LB.
06/28
Made OD600=1 cultures of bacteria and subcultured yeast on YPD (still not cloudy). Did CR and CV assay protocols and re-inoculated motility plates. Afiq contacted Lynne  Howell about a budget-friendly PGA assay.
06/29
Did CV assay on osmolarity, sodium and ethanol plates.  Assayed for agglutination phenotype with yeast cells but there doesn't seem to be much happening when bacteria and yeast mix. Measured motility haloes of the two WT strains, which seem to indicate that BW has  smaller motility radius than MG, and then returned the plates to darkness for 24 hours.
06/30
Finished assay on sodium plates but there were some issues:
1. Having the lid on may not be a good idea. It fits the sterile and non-sterile plates  differently.
2. Colour trend of resolubilized CV doesn't seem to follow that of the plate we  pipette from.
3. Amount of liquid remaining in the plate that we pipetted from is not uniform at  least partially due to the odd way tips stick to the multipipettor.
4. Does this assay measure biofilm or the lack of it?
07/02
Data on empty 96- well plate with and without lid were taken from the 96-well  plate reader.
07/03
TBA plates were made, OD = 1 cultures were made, overnight cultures and  sodium-less LB cultures were made for wild type strains.
07/04
Overnight cultures were prepared with regular LB and sodium-less LB. TBA  plates were also poured.
Started working on establishing stimuli protocols.
A meeting was held in preparation for the iGEMxDIYBio talk, and a general outline was  prepared.
07/05
Researched an adhesion assay that would pair with crystal violet for quantification. Plated competent cells on LB agar, left to grow at 37C for use in colony PCR.
07/06
07/07
Cloned csgD via colony PCR of MG1655 after resuspending lyophilized primers.
07/08
Ran gel electrophoresis of csgD PCR product from the day before (1% agarose TBE). Results show no PCR product.
07/09
A meeting was held with Dr. Steipe to discuss replacement of soytone with  tryptone in TSB. A digest was performed on pMal by cutting HindIII and NdeI cut  sites. A thermometer was broken by accident. It was cleaned up with AgNO3  found in the Hg-spill kit.
Resuspended lyophilized primers for pofut2, csrA, fimB, mlrA, ydeH, and ompA.
Conducted colony PCR for the above 6 genes and repeated csgD PCR cloning.
07/10
Regrew cultures.
Ran yesterdays PCR products on a 1% agarose TBE gel. Results show no PCR  products except for pofut2. Note: pofut2 PCR template was template DNA whereas the  others used genomic DNA from colony PCR.
pMAL vector was digested by other lab members with HindIII and NdeI.
NaCl assay sent by Seemi was checked over. Cultures were regrown.
07/11
A dilution of overnight culture was made. 2 µL was pipetted onto LB plates. The  plates were beaded and incubated at 37 degrees C. More LB was made.
Worked on establishing the phosphate buffered LB with Helia. Stimuli protocols were  established as per the deadline.
iGEMxDIYBio talk was presented.
Conducted a nanodrop to measure concentration of double-digested pMAL.
07/12
A meeting was held with Dr. Steipe to discuss functional characterization of  constructs. LB plates and LB kan plates were poured. Overnight cultures of  deletion strains and MG & BW was made using glycerol stocks. YPD medium  was made and autoclaved. Phosphate buffered LB was made. A recipe for fixing  cells was decided upon.
07/13
07/14
Overnight culture mini-experiment: do we actually need to take OD600 =1 every time?  Colony counts indicate that there are negligible differences in the number of cells in  culture. Monica grew cultures from glycerol stocks.
Made an aspirator to suck up crystal violet fluids.
07/15
PCR cleanup and subsequent nanodrop of pofut2 PCR product conducted by  Samantha.
Gel of Kristina's pMAL digest (HindIII/NdeI) ran by Michael – appears to work fine.
07/16
07/17

07/18
Gel ran of yesterday’s PCR products; “new” boiling colony PCR protocol found to be  successful! Old protocol colony PCR only successful for fimB, ydeH, and ompA.
07/19
07/20
07/21
07/22
07/23
Got trained on Houry plate reader. Tried CV, Adhesion, CR and CF on 3 dilutions of overnight culture, grown for 48h. HindIII/NdeI digest of pMAL followed by gel electrophoresis and gel extraction of the  large (5444bp) fragment for use in in-fusion.
07/24
07/25
07/26
Transformed MG1655 with pMAL glycerol stock via electroporation. Plated on LB agar  with ampicillin.
07/27
07/28
The solutions for the stimuli were all prepared: indole, ethanol, sucrose, salt and the  buffered LB. They were autoclaved separately to prevent precipitation and mixed together. This was done a couple of times and perfected based on the solubility and  other properties of the solutions. Set up plate plans for the strains.
07/29
07/30
2 WT overnight cultures in phosphate buffered LB, 50% EtOH solution was  prepared using phosphate buffered LB as a solvent. 2 M sucrose, 1 M indole,  and 1 M NaCl was also prepared in a similar way but the indole solution failed as  solubility for this substance is only 0.19 g/100 mL. A graph was created  comparing weight measurements of standard weights on the fine balance and  the regular balance. It was discovered that both were reasonably accurate.
Made glycerol stocks of MG1655+pMAL.
Conducted miniprep of pMAL.
Conducted nanodrop of miniprepped pMAL.
HindIII/NdeI digest of pMAL.
07/31
Gel electrophoresis of pMAL digestion and gel extraction of large fragment. Nanodrop of large fragment (poor yield).
Developed a phases plan for the assays.
1. Validate the machine: does it read concentration or volume?
2. Validate working concentrations of dyes
3. Validate petri-dish based assays with dilutions
4. Validate assays themselves.
08/01
Constant amount, not concentration, matters for absorbance. See CV data on July 31.  Another digestion of pMAL, along with extraction and nanodrop. Poor yield once again. Started another overnight digest for Kristina to gel extract.
Required amounts of crystal violet and calcofluor dye were pipetted into a 96  well-plate as desired.
08/02
Re-made phosphate buffered LB.
Excised 5444bp fragment of HindIII/NdeI pMAL digest and gave to Kristina to extract  with her kit.
Used speedvac DNA concentrator to concentrate the gel extraction products. Julianne and Helia used the 5444bp and pofut2 PCR product to attempt in-fusion  construction of our construct (unsuccessful).
08/03
Solutions were prepared but had to be remade since stimuli, LB and phosphate  buffer solutions had to all be autoclaved separately (otherwise they would form  precipitates).
08/04
08/05
Started working on safety scenarios with Al. Worked on remaking the motility plates  using a 0.3% agar in LB solution instead of TBA with Congo Red and Coomassie Blue.
08/06
Overnight cultures from glycerol stocks were made for all 23 E. coli strains.
08/07
08/08
Serial dilutions of CF, CV, CR and EtBr planned out. Need to find a cell lysis solution for EtBr since it binds with DNA. Data will be analyzed with Excel.
08/09
Microscope slides were made containing cultures from all 23 strains. The crystal  violet and calcofluor dye plates were read on the fluorescence spec. A serial dilution of 1:2 was done across 3 rows of the washed black plate for  calcofluor, starting from 1:100 dilution of 1 g/L. A serial dilution of 1:5 of original  CR solution was done. Both sets of data were read on the spec in the Houry Lab. Graphs were prepared for the initial CV serial dilution, the recent CR and CF  data.Worked on motility assay validation.
08/10
Overnight cultures of MG, BW, (delta)csgD, (delta)fimH and (delta)ompR were  made.
Worked on using different strains for validating motility assay.
08/11
A 1:2 serial dilution of a 1:100 dilution of 0.1% CV solution was done.  Absorbance readings were taken. EtBr protocol was modified.
To get the standard dilution curve of EtBr, we placed cells inside and add increasing  volumes of ethanol:acetic acid.
Measured OD600 for MG1655 and B25113 and dropped 1 microlitre onto the motility  plates.
08/12
The EtBr protocol was performed over 4 h. 3 rows had a constant volume and  concentration of EtBr, whereas 3 others had a constant of EtOH: acetic acid  solution. 3 control wells had Milli-Q, 3 had EtBr and LB, 3 had EtOH: acetic acid  and LB. Regular and kan CR plates were made. 2 replicates were made for each type of plate with MG and BW to test whether the glycerol stocks of the WT  strains are contaminated.
08/13
Decided that motility assay needs to be repeated by just dipping the pipette tip into the  overnight culture. Made a new batch of motility plates and made 70% EtOH.
The EtBr protocol was repeated with a 1:10 dilution of 0.5 mg/mL EtBr. CR + BB  plates were used to replate glycerol stocks of wild type strains.
08/14
Worked with Al on the safety scenarios guide. Re-made TSB and TB solutions.
EtBr protocol was repeated but only for increasing concentrations of EtOH: acetic acid with constant volume of the 1:10 dilution of 0.5 g/L EtBr solution. Non-kan  antibiotic plates were made to test contamination of some deletion strains. Insert  region for our master plasmid was constructed through PCR extension of two  complimentary template primers. In-fusion of this into the 5444bp fragment of  HindIII/NdeI pMAL digest to create pEBS (E. coli biofilm system) expression plasmid  and subsequent transformation of Stellar competent cells was carried out.
08/15
Made Coomassie blue-Congo Red agar for Colony Morphology plates. Analyzed plate  reader data. Isolated areas on the graph where the variation of fluorescence with  concentration is linear to confirm with another pipetting scheme. Question: does  background fluorescence interfere with that of bound EtBr? We need a lysis buffer that  will make suspensions clear for the EtBr assay. Dr. Steipe recommends making a  TBE-EtBr stock solution to avoid pipetting small volumes.
Revision of protocol: should include sodium azide. In-fusion insert was verified to be  correct on a 1% TBE agarose gel.
08/16
Prepared MG1655, BW25113, and deletion strains for csgD, csgA, and bcsA with with  stimuli.

08/19
Made sodium azide and culture suspension in TBE. Also made more ethanol: acetone  80:20 solution with anhydrous ethanol and acetone from the fumehood. Results show  linear variation of RFU with the concentration of culture (treated with sodium azide.)
08/20
08/21
Tried sodium azide protocol with 2x and 1/2x EtBr in comparison with 2 days ago.
08/22
08/23

Transformation of MG1655 and BW25113 (via heat shock) with pEBS+target genes.  Constructs used to transform sent for sequencing.
Gel of pSB1C3 digest confirms it is intact.
09/11
Analytical digests of yesterdays transformation plasmids identify them as being pEBS  without target genes. Contamination or human error (using the wrong samples) to be  blamed. Sequencing results confirm this. Therefore cannot use recently transformed  strains.
09/12
Other samples exist of “successful” pEBS+target gene plasmids. Digest all in  preparation of ligating target genes into pSB1C3. Linearize pSB1C3.
