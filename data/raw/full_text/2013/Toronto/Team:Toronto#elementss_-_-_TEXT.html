BW25113 WT
MG1655 WT BW25113 pEBS-csgD
BW25113 pEBS-csgD
The protein CsgD is a regulator of genes involved in curli assembly, induced in mid-exponential phase that are active in stationary phase. It positively controls σSexpression; its deletion should in principle interfere with biofilm formation. [1]
BW25113 pEBS-fimB
The gene fimB mediates off to on switching of fim operon, while fimE mediates on to off switching of the fim operon. Its deletion should in principle repress the fim operon, while its overexpression should in principle encourage fimbriae formation. [2]
BW25113 pEBS-mlrA
MlrA stands for a merR-like regulator A, which regulates curli production. Its overexpression should in principle suppress curli formation, while its deletion should in principle encourage curli formation. [3] BW25113 pEBS-ompA
The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by  repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is  overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to  visible light. [4] BW25113 pEBS-ydeH
YdeH is a diguanylate cyclase, where its product  regulates biofilm formation and motility. Its deletion has been shown to reduce  surface attachment of the cell, its overexpression has been shown to reduce  motility as well as flagella. [5]
BW25113 ΔfimA
FimA is the major subunit of E. coli type 1 (mannose  sensitive) fimbriae, also known as pili. Pili are made of ~1000 units of FimA. Its  deletion would remove the ability of a cell to produce fimbriae.[6]
BW25113 ΔompA
The protein OmpA influences cellulose production by  repressing cellulose production with CpxRA stress response system; it is  overexpressed in biofilm formation and repressed when cells are exposed to  visible light.[4]
BW25113 ΔdosC
A heme-containing, oxygen-sensitive diguanylate cyclase.  Its overexpression drives the cell to tend towards stationary phase physiology,  leading to more biofilm and less motility. DosC expression is dependent on σS .[7]
BW25113 ΔompX
Adhesion of the cell on a surface represses ompX. Its  deletion leads to increase in cell-surface contact in fimbriated E. coli, the  opposite occurs in non-fimbriated E. coli.[8]
BW25113 ΔpgaB
PgaB is involved in the transport of PGA (an  extra-membrane polysaccharide) across the outer membrane), which is involved in biofilm formation. Strains with mutant pgaB form less biofilm. Its expression is increased in environments with 1% ethanol or NaCl. [9]
BW25113 ΔrcsA
+ regulator of capsular polysaccharide synthesis. RcsA  and RcsB form a DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator. Deletion of this  gene should in principle cause some repression of extracellular  polysaccharides.[10]
BW25113 ΔfimH
FimH is the protein on the tip of fimbriae; they are the  mannose sensitive subunit that in e coli mediate binding to receptor structures. [11]
BW25113 ΔcsgD
regulator of genes involved in curli assembly, induced in  mid-exponential phase, csg-dependent genes active in stationary phase. [1]
BW25113 ΔompR
Function not clear. [12]
BW25113 ΔbcsA
Cellulose synthase, catalytic subunit. Its deletion should  cause a lower cellulose content on the cell walls or an absence of cellulose, with  a corresponding decrease in biofilm cell mass.[13]

STIMULI PROTOCOLS
Prelude
We looked at the effect of various stimuli on the polysaccharides, proteins, and structures  involved in the various stages of a biofilm. In particular, we looked at varying concentrations of  nutrients, physical environments, and media.
For nutrients, we chose three levels of stimulation – zero stimulation, medium stimulation, and  maximum stimulation. Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed  through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.
The stimuli were administered and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 (±3) hours at 23  degrees Celsius, which is the optimum temperature for biofilm growth (insert reference here). As bacteria turn their environment acidic as a result of anaerobic metabolism, buffered LB was  used using the phosphate salts, potassium phosphate monobasic and potassium phosphate  dibasic. pH 7 was adjusted for using 0.1 M concentration in Luria Broth. The E. coli cells were  incubated in buffered LB to maintain pH 7 and eliminate the extraneous variable of acidity. The  stock solutions for the stimuli were also created in buffered LB to prevent uneven nutrient levels; the phosphate salts are a systematic error across all inoculations and can thus be ignored.
In continuation with the project, we are planning to optimize results by combining the treatments which give the best results.
Ethanol
Reasoning: Given the large quantity of literature on the effect of ethanol on biofilm, it is a very important  stimulus. The ethanol concentrations being tested in this experiment are 0.53% and 2%.  Cegelskiet al. (2012) found that the level of some proteins involved in biofilm formation  increases in the presence of ethanol. They also found UT189 strain colonies to be 55% larger  (colony morphology assay). Cell viability is compromised at concentrations exceeding 4%. Materials for Ethanol stimulus: • Overnight cultures of E. coli
•40% EtOH solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight culture of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
2. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 4%EtOH in  buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final EtOH concentration of 1%.
3. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 15%EtOH  in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of  2%.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

Carbon Source
Sucrose
Reasoning:
The concentrations of sucrose being tested are 0.5 M and 0.1 M. Hagiwara et al. (2009) found  the growth curves to show optimum biofilm at a 0.1 M concentration. E.coli biofilm formation  decreases at high osmolarity - sucrose is being used here to test osmolarity as a non-ionic solute.
Materials for Ethanol stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
• 2 M sucrose stock solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight cultures in phosphate buffered media.
2. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of
0.3%sucrose solutionmade in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 M.
3. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of  1.5%sucrose in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final  concentration of 0.5 M.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

Indole
Reasoning:
Indole has a negative biofilm effect. The concentrations being tested are 500 micromolar and 300 micromolar.
Materials:
• 0.0009 M Indole in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio

1. 300 µM
  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was inoculated in buffered LB.
  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.
  c. 100 µl of 0.0009 M indole was added to the well.
  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius.
2. 500 µM
  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.

DMSO
Reasoning: Effects are similar to that of ethanol. The levels of certain proteins that regulate biofilm  formation were 3-3.9 times higher than baseline, and there was an increase in curli (Lim et al.,  2012). The concentrations being tested are 4% and 2%.
Materials list:
• Dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. 2%
  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.
  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.
  c. 100 µl of 6% DMSO was added to the well.
  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius.
2. 4%
  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.
  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.
  c. 100 µl of 12% DMSO was added to the well.
  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius

Media
NaCl stimulus
Reasoning:
The concentrations being tested are 0.3 M and 0.5 M. NaCl is being tested as an ionic solute.  Park et al. (2012) found NaCl-free to increase attachment and the capacity of biofilm formation  under salt (0.1-0.3 M) was similar to that of the control. Zogaj et al. (2001) says that the bcs genes were expressed under 0.5 M - it is unclear whether that is similar to the levels found in the  wild type strain.
Materials:
• Phosphate buffered LB without NaCl
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. Sodium chloride free Luria Broth
  a. 275 µl of NaCl-free LB was added to the well.
  b. 25 µl of overnight culture was added to the well.
  c. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius.

Tryptone Soy Broth
Reasoning:
Verma et al. (2010) found most biofilm to be produced at 37 degrees in TSB media.
Materials:
• TSB media
• Overnight culture
Protocol:
1. To 900 mL of double distilled water, add 17 g Tryptone, 3 g peptone-B, 2.5 g glucose, 5 g NaCl and 2.5 g of K2HPO4 to prepare TSB media.
