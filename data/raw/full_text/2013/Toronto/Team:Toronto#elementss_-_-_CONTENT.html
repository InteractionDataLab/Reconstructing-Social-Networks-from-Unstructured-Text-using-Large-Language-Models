We looked at the effect of various stimuli on the polysaccharides, proteins, and structures 
involved in the various stages of a biofilm. In particular, we looked at varying concentrations of 
nutrients, physical environments, and media.
For nutrients, we chose three levels of stimulation – zero stimulation, medium stimulation, and 
maximum stimulation. Their effects on the biofilm response were then observed and analysed 
through a battery of assays looking at the levels of biofilm components.
The stimuli were administered and the cell cultures were incubated for 48 (±3) hours at 23 
degrees Celsius, which is the optimum temperature for biofilm growth (insert reference here).
As bacteria turn their environment acidic as a result of anaerobic metabolism, buffered LB was 
used using the phosphate salts, potassium phosphate monobasic and potassium phosphate 
dibasic. pH 7 was adjusted for using 0.1 M concentration in Luria Broth. The E. coli cells were 
incubated in buffered LB to maintain pH 7 and eliminate the extraneous variable of acidity. The 
stock solutions for the stimuli were also created in buffered LB to prevent uneven nutrient levels;
the phosphate salts are a systematic error across all inoculations and can thus be ignored.
In continuation with the project, we are planning to optimize results by combining the treatments
which give the best results. </P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Ethanol</U></B>
Reasoning:
Given the large quantity of literature on the effect of ethanol on biofilm, it is a very important 
stimulus. The ethanol concentrations being tested in this experiment are 0.53% and 2%. 
Cegelskiet al. (2012) found that the level of some proteins involved in biofilm formation 
increases in the presence of ethanol. They also found UT189 strain colonies to be 55% larger 
(colony morphology assay). Cell viability is compromised at concentrations exceeding 4%.
Materials for Ethanol stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
•40% EtOH solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B>Protocol:</B>
1. Grow overnight culture of E. coli in phosphate buffered media.
2. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 4%EtOH in 
buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final EtOH concentration of
1%.
3. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 15%EtOH 
in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final concentration of 
2%.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;"><B>Carbon Source</B></P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>Sucrose</U></B>
Reasoning:
The concentrations of sucrose being tested are 0.5 M and 0.1 M. Hagiwara et al. (2009) found 
the growth curves to show optimum biofilm at a 0.1 M concentration. E.coli biofilm formation 
decreases at high osmolarity - sucrose is being used here to test osmolarity as a non-ionic solute.
Materials for Ethanol stimulus:
• Overnight cultures of E. coli
• 2 M sucrose stock solution prepared in phosphate buffered LB
• 96-well plate
Protocol:
1. Grow overnight cultures in phosphate buffered media.
2. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 
0.3%sucrose solutionmade in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain
a final concentration of 0.1 M.
3. Inoculate 200 µL of 1:100 dilution of overnight culture along with 100 µL of 
1.5%sucrose in buffered LB solution into a well in a 96-well plate to obtain a final 
concentration of 0.5 M.
4. Incubate in darkness at 23 degrees C for 48 hours.

Reasoning:
Indole has a negative biofilm effect. The concentrations being tested are 500 micromolar and 300
micromolar.
Materials:
• 0.0009 M Indole in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. 300 µM  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was inoculated in buffered LB.  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 µl of 0.0009 M indole was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius. 
2. 500 µM  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 µl of 0.0015 M was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius.

</P><P style="font-size:18px;"><B><U>DMSO</U></B>
Reasoning:
Effects are similar to that of ethanol. The levels of certain proteins that regulate biofilm 
formation were 3-3.9 times higher than baseline, and there was an increase in curli (Lim et al., 
2012). The concentrations being tested are 4% and 2%.
Materials list:
• Dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate buffered LB
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. 2%  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 µl of 6% DMSO was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 Celsius. 
2. 4%  a. 1:100 dilution of overnight culture was incubated in buffered LB.  b. 200 µl of the dilution was added to the well.  c. 100 µl of 12% DMSO was added to the well.  d. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius

Reasoning:
The concentrations being tested are 0.3 M and 0.5 M. NaCl is being tested as an ionic solute. 
Park et al. (2012) found NaCl-free to increase attachment and the capacity of biofilm formation 
under salt (0.1-0.3 M) was similar to that of the control. Zogaj et al. (2001) says that the bcs
genes were expressed under 0.5 M - it is unclear whether that is similar to the levels found in the 
wild type strain.
Materials:
• Phosphate buffered LB without NaCl
• Overnight culture diluted in a 1:100 ratio
Protocol:
1. Sodium chloride free Luria Broth  a. 275 µl of NaCl-free LB was added to the well.  b. 25 µl of overnight culture was added to the well.  c. The culture was incubated for 48 hours at 23 degrees Celsius.
