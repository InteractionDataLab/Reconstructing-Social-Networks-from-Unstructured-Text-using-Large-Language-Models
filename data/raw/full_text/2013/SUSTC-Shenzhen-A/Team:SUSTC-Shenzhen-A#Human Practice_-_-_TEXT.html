Communication
communicate with other teams in HongKong
The graph above shows our expericence to the HKUST, we two teams had a wonderful communication, and we became good friends.
to high school students
The two figures shown behind were the recordings of our journey to the ShenZhen experimental high school and ShenZhen foreign language high school. We had introduced the concept of the synthetic biology, IGEM, and our project to them, which was welcomed by them!
to adults
On Sept.25.2013 Jingyi Liu had a short presentation about synthetic biology and iGem in Wall Street English center at windows of the world in Shen Zhen. Since most of students there are in theri twenties or thirties, we spreaded new ideas in synthetic biology to adults~! They showed big interest in synthetic biology and even came up with their own thoughts during the presentation. What's more, after presentation, though they didn't konw any specialized word, many of them still stayed with Liu discussing about biology with body language till 10 p.m.. It was a amazing moment to make so many people curious in synthetic biology, and it was a even better moment to let them comprehend synthetic biology.
