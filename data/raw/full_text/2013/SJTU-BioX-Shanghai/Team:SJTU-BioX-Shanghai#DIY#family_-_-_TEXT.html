Family Portrait!
How to make the box?
How to assemble the box?
We have 4 generation DarkBox in all and this the family portrait.
At the very beginning we custom-make a black barrel to culture E.coil in single conical flask.
Later we made our darkbox 1.0 so that we can culture E.coil in 16 test tubes at the same time.
This potato chips cylinder darkbox was born in an emergency to replace the black barrel and worked very well.
At last we make out the final version metabolic gear-box which can give 16 different light intensity and culture 48 samples at one time!
