Effect on Environment
As our project is so fundamental when using in the production, The E.coli constructed by us will just be used only in the factory or lab. Public don’t need to use them. So the influence it can exert on environment is negligible.
When we thought about the Metabolic Gear Box, we have already evaluated its effect on the environment. After confirming that it has little possibility to harm the environment, we started the project.
