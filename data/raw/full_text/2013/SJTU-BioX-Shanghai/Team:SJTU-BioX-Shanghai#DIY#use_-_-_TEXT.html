How to assemble the box?
How to make the box?
Family Portrait!
First we need to insert the SCM onto our PCB and check whether it works or not.
Secondary we should put our PCB into the dark box and plug in.
Then we can put our prepared barrier into dark box(we can see the blue led has already been turned on) and switch in the USB data line.
Finally we can input the computer signal we want to the SCM in our dark box.
