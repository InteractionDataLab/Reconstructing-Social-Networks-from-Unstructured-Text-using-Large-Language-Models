Molecular Cloning Protocols
Digestion
Material
EcoRI, BglII, PstI, XhoI, SpeI,XhoI,FD buffer,FD Green buffer, DNA,sterile water
Digestion temperature
37℃
Time period
Plasmid: 4-6h(the higher the concentration, the longer time it takes.
DNA fragment:4-6h(the higher the concentration, the longer time it takes.Since it is more difficult to digest DNA than plasmid, digesting DNA requires more time.
Hind III, EcoR I, BamH I: 0.5-1 hour. No longer than 1 hour.
System amount
50ul system is preferred if there is subsequent operations. If digestion is only for identification, 20ul system is used.
During the double digestion, the optimum buffer system which is suitable for both enzymes should be utilized. Without such shared system, digestion of two different enzymes is usually separated.

Gel extraction
Material
Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (centrifugation)
Experimental Procedure
Add 500uL balance liquid(BL) to the spin column(CA2). Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Discard the flow-through and put the column back to the collection tube.(optional)
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel and weigh it in a clean centrifuge tube (A gel slice of 100 mg approximately equals to 100 µL).
Add 3 volume of sol solution(PN) to the centrifuge tube and incubate the mixture at 50℃ for 10 min with mixing the tube by tapping the bottom of the tube occationally till the gel has melted completely. Cool the tube to RT.
Transfer the mixture to an spin column (CA2) within a collection tube. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Discard the flow-through and put the column back to the collection tube.
Add 600 µL DNA Wash Buffer (PW) to the column and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Discard the flow through and put the column back to the collection tube.
Repeat step 5.
Put the column back to the collection tube. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to discard the PW totally. Keep the lid open for several minutes.
Put the column back to the clean collection tube. Add ddH2O to the column vacantly and keep it at room temperature for 2 minutes. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to collect the DNA solution.
Transfer the eluted solution to CA2 and keep it at room temperature for 2minutes. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature.
Gel electrophoresis to verify the correctness and concentration of bands.
Important Notes
If the balance liquid turns turbid, incubate it at 37℃ for several minutes.
When cutting the gel, keep the UV irradiation time period as short as possible, otherwise DNA would be damaged.
For those DNA fragment shorter than 100bp or larger than 10kb, the sol solution volume should be increased as well as the time period for adsorption and elution.
Recovery depends on the initial DNA amount and elution volume. The less the DNA, the less the elution volume, the smaller of recovery.
PCR
Reagents
KOD-Plus-Neo
Tap enzymes
Experiment system
Experiment system with KOD enzymes (Mostly 50uL)
Experiment system with taq enzymes:
Reaction temperature:
Two-step method:         Predenature           94℃，2min         Denature and extension           {           98℃ 10sec            68℃ 30sec/kb           } × 25-45 cycles           4℃
Three-step method：         Predenature           94℃，2min         Denature，annealing and extension           98℃ 10sec             {          （Tm-5）℃  30sec           68℃  30sec/kb           } × 25-45 cycles           4℃
Important Notes
KOD enzymes should be operated in ice.
Two-step method is preferred if primer Tm is relatively high.
1.2% agarose gel is used to separate 1kb-5kb DNA; 0.8% agarose gel is used to separate 3k-10k DNA; 2.5-3% agarose gel is used to separate DNA longer than 100bp.
PCR reaction system varies from 20uL to 100uL. Under most cases, 20uL system is preferred as long as PCR is for identification only. However, when subsequent experiments such as tailing, digestion which require certain amount of DNA are necessary, 50uL system is usually preferred.
KOD enzymes are preferred if the purpose of PCR is for gene amplification. At the same time, PCR for identification or tailing usually requires taq enzymes.
PCR Purification
Reagents
LifeFeng DNA PCR purification kit
Experimental Procedure
Transfer PCR system (< 250uL)   to 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 5 volume Buffer PD and mix. Have a quick centrifugation to remove the liquid on lid.
Transfer the mixture to DNA spin column (A4) and put it in a collection tube.
Centrifuge at 7000g for 1 minute and replace the collection tube with a new collection tube.
To wash, add 500uL Buffer WB to the spin column (A4) and centrifuge at 7000g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column back in the same tube.
Repeat step 4.
Centrifuge at 12,000g for 2 minutes.
Place spin column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add ddwater (>30uL) to the center of the membrane. Let the column stand for 1-2 min and centrifuge the column for 1 min at 12,000g.
Add elution liquid back to spin column and centrifuge at 12,000g for 1 min. ( Inoculating ddwater at 65℃ prior would improve the elution efficiency )
Gel electrophoresis to verify the concentration of bands.
Important Notes
Buffer PD contains irritant compounds, thus be careful not to avoid contamination of skin.
DNA Ligation
Experimental Procedures
Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice.
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
For cohesive (sticky) ends, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes.
For blunt ends or single base overhangs, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
