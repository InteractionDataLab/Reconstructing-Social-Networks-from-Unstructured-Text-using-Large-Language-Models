Regulator-CRISPRi Introdution to CRISPRi Why CRISPRi? Integrating CRISPRi
Why CRISPRi?
Totipotent
Regulate any gene! Both on the genome and on plasmids.
Convenient
Change the target gene as you wish by changing sgRNA. We would be able to provide a single plasmid that pocesses all three sgRNAs. Just make changes to this plasmid to regulate some other genes.
Regulate multiple genes
Simultaneously and independently. Optimize a whole pathway for your desired products.
