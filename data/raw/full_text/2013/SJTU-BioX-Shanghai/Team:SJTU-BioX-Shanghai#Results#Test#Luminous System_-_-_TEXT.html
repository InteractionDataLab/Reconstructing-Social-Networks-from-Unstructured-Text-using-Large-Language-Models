Different intenstiy
At the very begining, we want to test whether the vaules in UI can affect the light intensity with LEDs, so we chose four value to see whether there are difference with differnt value sended by UI.
The result give a strong evident to show the practicability of devices, so we make some further experiments to test the devices.
Linear Relation
Actually, What we really want is a linear relationship between values in UI inputs and light intensity of LEDs, so we held a test. We chose parameters with the range of 0 to 255 and the interval is 5, our result shows a perfect linear relationship of each light, and different slope among different light.
The data listed above is with interval 15, the full data can be got by this link: File:Light Intensity.xls
