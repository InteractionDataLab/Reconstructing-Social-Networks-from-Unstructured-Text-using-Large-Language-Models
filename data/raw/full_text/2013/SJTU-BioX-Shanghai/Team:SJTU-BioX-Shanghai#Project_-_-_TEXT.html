Project Overview
Why CRISPRi?
Regulate genomic genes without changing their promoters.
"Totipotent"! Change the target gene as you want by making some minor changes in gRNA sequence.
Why Lights?
Easy to adjust! Get rid of those laborious work of adding inducing chemicals! :)
Multi-control! lights of different colors can be exerted simultaneously. And one sensor will only be activated by photons with a narrow range of wavelengths.
Accurate!
Uniformly distribute in cell culture.
Why CRISPRi AND Lights?
Lights alone? CANNOT be easily applied on genomic genes.
CRISPRi alone? HARD to be simultaneous; NOT convenient.
Why Computer?
Computer and Electronics! Experience the information century!
Input your desired expression level into our User Interface on the computer. And just leave rest of the work to our program and our illuminating device!
