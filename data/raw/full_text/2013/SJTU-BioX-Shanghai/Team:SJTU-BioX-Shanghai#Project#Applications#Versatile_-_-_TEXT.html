Versatile!
Only the 20bp base-pairing region is to be substituted in order to change regulation target. That is the ONLY difference!
Therefore, our product is a versatile one that can be used anywhere of metabolome, and perhaps in the future, even be applied to interfere signal transductions for medical use.
