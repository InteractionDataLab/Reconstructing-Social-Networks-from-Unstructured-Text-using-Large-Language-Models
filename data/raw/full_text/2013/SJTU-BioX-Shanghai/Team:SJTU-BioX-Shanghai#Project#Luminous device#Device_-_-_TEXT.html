Container
The device provide a dark environment for our biological system.
And we aim at measuring a big amount of independent samples with gradient light intensity at the same time. The container should have sealed cells and provide good fixation with SCM and PCBs. Thus we have a primary design. More details are showed in Home Page DIY plate.
The Heart-MCU
MCU provide a way to control the light intensity of LEDs, the thoery of the MCU can be find in Software . MCU is set on the back of PCB(Printed circuit board), the output port one to eight connect to the base of audions, which determine the light intensity.
The MCU is supplied by 5V power. But concerning about the device's working time, we choose three lithium batteries with 12V, 2000Mah, which guarantee the device won't out of power in expirements period. The batteries can also be recharged after one circle, which guarantee the service life of the whole device.
Either Monochromatic light or polychromatic lights can be used in the MCU output ports, we can ajdust one gene or mutilple genes in the same time. If lots of MCUs are used in the system, with enough light sensors, we can ajust the whole metabolic system without biological interference in genes.
The Body-PCB
PCB is a interface between MCU and LEDs, which contains basic electronic components such as audions,resistances. Audions are used to change the voltage of LEDs, and resistances are used to do fine adjustment on light intensity. Each PCB is divided to 16 area, which means 16 parallel experiments can be conduted each time. High-capacity, stability, reliability are fully showed in this part.
Moreover, the advantage of PCB is easy to conduct mass production. Once lots of PCBs are used in the system, we can ajust one or more bacterial communities. When this method is used in industrial manufactures, we can optimize the Production Process，which will improve the bioengineering.
