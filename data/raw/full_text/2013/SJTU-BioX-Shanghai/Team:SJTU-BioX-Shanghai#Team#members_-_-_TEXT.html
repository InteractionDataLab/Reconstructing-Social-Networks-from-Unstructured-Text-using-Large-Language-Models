MA GANG
Ph.D, Associate Professor, Co-Principal Investigator
Dr. Ma’s interesting focus on two directions: organism development and signaling transduction; gene expression and metabolism pathway regulation by using synthetic biology. His works have been sponsored by NSFC and 973 programs. He has won two golden medals of International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition (iGEM, a synthetic biology competition) as an instructor of SJTU-BIOX-SHANGHAI team in 2009 and 2010. In 2011, he has won the Best New Biobrick and Device (Asia Jamboree) award and the Sweet Sixteen award (World Jamboree).
Dr.Ma provided us the basic facilities and reagents for our experiment and gave us advice in system construction as well as in our experimenal process.

Advisors
LI DALI
File:Ldl.gif
Ph.D, Associate Professor, Master's Supervisor in ECNU
Majoring in organism development and signaling transduction as well as new methods to construct gene knockout mouse model.Dr.LI has provided us the plasmids containg dCas9 and sgRNA sequences for our further experiment.
WANG YUSHU
Research assistant in Ma's Lab
Working on development and application of the synthetic genomic regulatory devices in cyanobacteria and E.coli.She has helped us a lot in supplementing our reagents consumption.She also gave us advice in experiment.
WANG YOU
Research Assistant in Ma's Lab
WANG YOU worked as a Research Assistant in Ma's Lab focusing on Synthetic Biology to develop new systems to control the metabolism pathway. As the core member of 2011 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team, he with his team members developed the rare codon system and won the Best New Biobrick and Device (Asia Jamboree) award and the Sweet Sixteen award (World Jamboree). He is now persueing his Ph.D degree in Duke University.
