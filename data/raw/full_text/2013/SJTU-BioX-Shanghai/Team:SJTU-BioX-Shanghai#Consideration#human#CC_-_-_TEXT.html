Communication on Campus
Synthetic Biology is a quickly developing field. If we want to enhance the development of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, communication on campus is necessary. In this year, we communicated with different people, such as the researchers of SJTU in multiple fields including physics and electronics, the biologists in our city, and many new friends in different districts. Through the communication, we gave what we can offer to help people know more about Synthetic Biology and learned a lot from others.
Communication with Physicists
measuring the parameters of LED
As soon as we put forward the idea, Metabolic Gear Box, a crucial question rised up. How can we confirm that our luminous device is valid? To attain accurate data substantiating the validity of our device, we asked the physists of SJTU for help. Though burried in much work of themselves, they still offered patient guidance to us. With the help of them ,espatially associate professor Hong Zhou, we finally assured many parameters of our device, which are important to guarantee the wholeness of our project.
We really appreciate the physists in SJTU. Without their help, we would spent longer time figuring out the parameters of our device. And this also means that our team really achieved the goal of subject cross in the field of synthetic biology.

Communication with Undergraduates in Shanghai
On April 21st 2013, we took part in the Life Science Forum of Undergraduates in Shanghai, which was held in Second Military Medical University. In the forum, we delivered a report introducing iGEM, synthetic biology, our team as well as our project last year to other schools that hasn't taken part in the iGEM competetion. Many undergraduates and teachers proposed various questions about synthetic biology and our 'Membrane Magic' system construction.  Students from TJU as well as ECNU showed much interest in iGEM competition. They are planning to join our iGEM family in 2014. We also got lots of new ideas from other future-biologists through our communication!
Communication with New Friends
In this year we communicated with many new friends, including many iGEM participants.
Discussion with USTC iGEM team
We keep connection with iGEM team from USTC. We had a short meeting concerning team development as well as brain storming methods.
We also sent several parts, including BBa_K771002, BBa_K771003, BBa_K771004, BBa_K771005, to Zhejiang University and Chinese University of Hong Kong to help their project in this year.

And in May, an undergraduate student from Shandong University, who is also interested in iGEM, got to know one of our teammates in a conference held by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in University of Science and Technology of China. From then on, they communicated a lot. Since there was no iGEM team in Shandong University at that time, our teammate gave a lot of useful information to students of Shandong University, such as the process of participating in iGEM, the preparation for iGEM, and some communication conferences held by differnt 2013 iGEM teams in this year. Besides, in August, another student from Shandong University visited our team. Partially because of our help, our new friends from Shandong University have done a lot to construct their own iGEM team, and may participate the 2014 iGEM competition.
2013 iGEM conference in NCTU
In August, we attended the 2013 iGEM conference held by National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. In the conference, we made friends with students from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan University, National Yang Ming Universiy, Hong Kong University, and Zhejiang University. We talked about iGEM, synthetic biology and even daily life with our new friends, learned a lot from them, and helped each other to improve the projects. Really thanks to NCTU's treatment! Besides, we made hundreds of beautiful bookmarks as a gift, which is really liked by our new friends, and did a survey in the conference to investigate people's opinion on subject cross in the field of synthetic biology.
After the 2013 iGEM conference, Rou-Chien Liao, a cute girl from NYMU-Taipei team, visited our lab in SJTU. We communicated with her as the view of projects, and took her around in Shanghai for the whole day.

In the year of 2013, we established a steady bond between variable friends and ourselves. We will cherish the friendship constucted on the basis of iGEM forever.
