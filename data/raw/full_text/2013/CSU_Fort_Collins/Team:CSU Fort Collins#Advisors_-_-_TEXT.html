The Guys with All the Answers
Brian Searcy
Research Scientist
You name it, he's lived there. Our coach, mentor and supreme overlord is a Renaissance Man of the biology world. If you have a question, he has an answer, and boy did that come in handy. However he has since moved on to teach at Oregon State University.
Dr. Patrick Shipman
Assistant Professor Department of Mathematics Colorado State University
Dr. Shipman was our go-to man for help with modeling our system. He has also provided a new home for CSU's iGEM laboratory space! What a guy.
Dr. Lucas Argueso
Lab Manager and Researcher Colorado State University
If there was a word for someone who knew everything about yeast, that word would be Lucas. Dr. Argueso is nothing short of a miracle worker when it comes to yeast biology and he's not afraid to prove it.
Tim Gonzales
Research Associate and Lab Manager Colorado State University
Tim Gonzales is the head hauncho of lab space in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. He helped find us parts and fittings for our pressure data collecting experiments and so generous with his time and resources. We couldn't have done it without him!
Philip Fox
Research Scientist Colorado State University
When we were trying to figure out how to image the salt content of yeast using fluorescent dyes, Philip Fox provided us the knowledge and background to using them. He also aided in providing us the actual dye (NaTRIUM and Pluronic). Despite determining that using the dye was not the way to go to measure intercellular sodium levels, we learned a lot with his help about microscopy and working with the dyes.
