Results
Before we even attempted to engineer new yeast, we needed an initial trial to see if the tires would even inflate with hydrogen peroxide and yeast. We used a 26" bicycle tire as our testing apparatus. To measure pressure we used a Fluke Multimeter to directly measure millivolts from a pressure transducer hooked up to the bicycle tire. We combined the yeast (20ml), 10% H2O2 (100ml), YPD (130ml) in the tire itself sequentially. Once mixed, we immediately attached the pressure transducer and recorded pressure data at 10 second intervals. Below is the graph of our results.
