Modeling
We are in the process of modeling the methods of sodium regulation in yeast, and then adapting it to the desalination strain that we developed theoretically. This will help in determining how all of our modifications will affect sodium levels in various compartments and the cytoplasm, and once finished we will be able to numerically see the predicted effect of the addition and removal of various pumps to various membranes. Coming soon!
