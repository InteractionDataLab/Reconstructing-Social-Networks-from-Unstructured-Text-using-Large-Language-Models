Our plan was to design our bio-bricks using Gibson Assembly and gBlocks. However, we were unable to get the Gibson Assemblies to work and we were unable to produce our parts. One big hurdle in designing our parts was that some of the sequences for the proteins we wanted to use had several restriction enzyme sites that were not compatible with the bio-brick standards. This is why we chose Gibson Assembly over using Standard Assembly. It was suggested by staff members at the iGEM headquarters that we prompt forthcoming iGEM teams of the potential risks of relying on Gibson Assembly alone.
