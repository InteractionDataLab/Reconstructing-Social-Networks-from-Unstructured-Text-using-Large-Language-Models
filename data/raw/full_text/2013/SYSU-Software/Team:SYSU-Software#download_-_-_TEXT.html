Introduction Accurate simulation and gene circuit design are essential  but difficult parts in synthetic biology.Here, we designed  CAST to cover the workflow from beginning to end, users  can focus on function design and the gene circuit would  be automatically designed. Furthermore, we developed a  new simulation model that work with standard dynamic  characteristic and verified by wetlab experiments.  Moreover, we build an expandable database that users  can contribute their own dynamic information which would  lead to more accurate and sufficient dynamic information  of all the Biobricks. Finally, our software is designed as an  easy deployed server so that it can be used on personal  purpose or shared by a whole lab or institution.
