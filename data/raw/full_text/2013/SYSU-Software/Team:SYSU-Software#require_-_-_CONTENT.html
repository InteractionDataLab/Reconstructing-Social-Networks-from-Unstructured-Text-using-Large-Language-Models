                      1. Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained.  
                    </SPAN><SPAN id="medal-answer">
                      Using our database functions, Team SYSU-China's biobrick designs are shared among team members and output as SBOL format file which can be delivered through Internet during their experiment.
                    </SPAN><SPAN id="medal-question">
                      2a. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
                      OR
                      
                      2b. In place of requirement two, a team may instead use SBOL in your software documentation.

                      All the Biobricks data from our software’s database could be expressed in SBOL format.

                      PLUS
                      3a. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports one of the following:
                      1. design of BioBrick Parts or Devices
                      2. construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices
                      3. characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices
                      4. the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices</SPAN><SPAN id="medal-answer">We have developed a simulation system that every regulatory element is given several standard dynamic parameters. Thus most gene expression process can be simulated with our system. Furthermore, newly found element can be also definited with these parameters to be simulated. </SPAN><SPAN id="medal-question">           5. the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.

                      We are providing the improved SBOL format for Biobrick sharing. We combined several standard dynamic information for different type of Biobricks with other tradition information and hopefully it would lead to a new era of quantitative design.</SPAN><SPAN id="medal-question">

                      We have done both.

                      We plan to improve our software tool in several aspects presented below:
                      First, the regulation network of E.coli would be introduced and simulated by our next version of software so that interaction between artificial genes and host metabolism could be considered during creature design.
                      Second, Biobrick designer for riboswitch and riboregulator would be added, moreover, regulators’ dynamic characteristics would be predicted by our software and directly used in circuit design.
                      Third, we would construct interface to programmable laboratory instruments so that the experimental process would be more automated and standardization.
                    </SPAN><SPAN id="medal-question">
                      2. Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.
