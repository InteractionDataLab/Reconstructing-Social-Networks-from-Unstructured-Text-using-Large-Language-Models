1.Best Human Practices Advance:
Will the world be a safe place if we make biology easy to engineer? How do the lessons of the past inform the discussion going forward? Think beyond just convincing people that “synthetic biology is good.” Find a new way to help human civilization consider, guide, and address the impacts of ongoing advances in biotechnology.
We not only constructed an online game for spreading basic concepts of synthetic biology, but also held a TEDxSYSU project to introduce the origin and development about synthetic biology.
2.Best Clotho:
For clotho users, we have created a clotho app to open our software. The interface in clotho allow users open the server and web page at the same time.
3.Best Model:
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the functioning and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices.
To fulfil the concept of quantitative design, we introduced a brand new model to simulate Biobricks’ function and operation. Details are shown on our wikipage.
4.Best New Standard:
Standards help to make sharing biological parts easier. For example, the BioBrick DNA assembly standard makes it easier to construct parts from pre-existing parts created by the entire BioBrick community. What other sorts of standards can you create? How about a standard system for measuring promoter activity, a standard method for reporting compatible/ incompatible parts, a standard to help describe and control post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylation), or chassis-specific standards (for instance, a system for describing and sharing transgenic yeast)?
We are providing the improved SBOL format for Biobrick sharing. We combined several standard dynamic information for different type of Biobricks with other tradition information. Moreover, we apply JSON format instead of XML to interact with web application more easily and be transmitted faster.
