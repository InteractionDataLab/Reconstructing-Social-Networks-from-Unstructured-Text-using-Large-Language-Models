Synthetic Biology, depending on interdisciplinary knowledge and experience, cooperates wet and dry experiments to engineer the artificial biological systems. Our team has developed an integrated tool, CAST (Computer Aided Synbio Tool), to address specific technical challenges in synthetic biology. Our software can automatically perform the regulatory networks and gene circuits designing, modeling, vector designing and proposal build.All of the design can be stored in database to be shared through CAST. In addition, we incorporated wetlab experimentation into our project to validate our new simulation model that work with standard dynamic characteristic. Altogether, the combination of the design automation, innovative models and algorithms, and wetlab validation makes complex biological systems accessible to researchers who want rapid, intuitive, and high-quality accomplish their designs.
