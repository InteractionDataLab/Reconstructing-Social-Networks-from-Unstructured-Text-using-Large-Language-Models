TEDx and Game
TEDx SYSU
TED is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out in 1984 as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design. TEDxSYSU is a program designed to give communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at Sun Yat-sen University.
In order to let people know more about synthetic biology and IGEM project. On September 15, 2013，Our team cooperated with SYSU-China(another iGEM team）and TEDx SYSU(an authorized TEDx organizer) . We held a TEDx salon in our campus, of which the theme is “Assembly life”. Three speakers Zheng Lingling, Sun Mengyi and Miaozong were invited to make presentations Deciphering the Code of Life，The eighth day of creation, Computer Network Synthetic Biology to introduce the synthetic biology about its origin, development, progress and application prospect.
There were more than thirty students and teachers participating in the salon. They showed great interest in this emerging field that contain network and experiments. We especially talked about biosafety, the crucial topic in synthetic biology. Team leader of SYSU-China had been invited to introduce the suicide mechanism which was deposited in their project. Moreover, students shared their innovative ideas about controlling artificial creatures. This activity not only advertised the creation spirit of synthetic biology, but also reminded everyone to keep their creation safe.
Game：Life is Synthesizing
In order to let more people know about Synthetic biology and show the dynamics within the cell. We developed an interesting web page game.
Start from the initial stage of life: a cell is producing proteins avidly. Polymerases slide through a promoter, and transcript as much genes until meet the terminator. The little creature evolve into more complex life forms and desire more and more production. Players can evolve their little cell into developed life forms by collecting enough proper proteins. In addition, players have to deal with the biosafety problems when sophisticated creatures been created. Poison proteins may appear and collapse your construction without enough attention. Colleting enough resources and keeping avoid from dangerous zone is the key to final success.
Life is just synthesizing…
