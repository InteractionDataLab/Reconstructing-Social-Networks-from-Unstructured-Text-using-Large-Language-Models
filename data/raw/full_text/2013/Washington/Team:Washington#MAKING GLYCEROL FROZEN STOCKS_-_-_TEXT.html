Summary:
For the long-term storage of microbial  cultures
Make sure that you do not contaminate  glycerol stocks and they do not thaw.
1. Grow overnight culture (1 mL) of your  cells in selective media
2. Mix 500 mL of your culture with 500 mL  of 40-60% glycerol in a cryo tube (or 1.5mL tube). Immediately place at -80  C (high concentration of glycerol is toxic to cells and prolonged exposure  to it kills them at RT).
Making E-coli glycerol stock:
Material needed:
Growing E-coli (mid log phase)
40%-60% glycerol stock (in water, autoclaved)
Cryo-tubes
To make the E-coli stock:
Inoculate 5 ml LB media using a single colony  with appropriate antibiotics. Allow to grow to mid log phase(~12hrs).
In cryo-tube add 500 ul of growing E-coli.
Add 500 ul of 40%-60% autoclaved glycerol.
Mix briefly by vortexing and store at -80 C  
Growing cells from glycerol  stock:
With sterile pipet tip, touch the surface of the  glycerol stock (DO NOT THAW), and throw the tip in 5 ml LB media with  appropriate antibiotics.
