Fluorescent Analysis Protocol
1.  Remove 200 ul culture from each well, and pipette to a 96-well black, clear-bottom plate for analysis. 2. GFP expression levels are analyzed on a spectramax M5e plate reader (bottom read) with an excitation of 480 nm and emission at 520nm. Set the plate reader to automix the samples for 5 seconds prior to analysis. 3. GFP expression levels were normalized against cell density by dividing the relative fluorescence unit values by OD600 data.
