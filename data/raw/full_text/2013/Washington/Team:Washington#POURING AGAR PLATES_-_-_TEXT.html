Pouring Plates Protocol:
1. Microwave LB or TB  media until completely liquid (be careful of rapid phase changes called ‘superheating’). For 250mL, 3 - 4 minutes on high power or 12 - 14 minutes on  30% (low)
2. Prep plating area:  sterilize surface with ethanol, turn bunsen burner on
3. If antibiotic:  (stocks are 1000x) place 1:1000 ratio.
example: if media is 250 mL, place 250 uL in broth
4. Lay out ready to go  plates
5. Pour in ~ 20 - 30 ml  of agar per plate
6. Partially close/lay  the lids over the cooling plates (everything near the burner)
Plating Protocol 2:
From: http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/BISC209/S13:_Pour_Plates/
1. Place the Petri  plates to be poured right side up in front of you (if many plates are to be  poured, you may want to set them up in stacks of three).
2. Obtain a bottle of  agar. Microwave agar with no lid. For less volumes approx. 1min per  100ml (full power). For 250ml 15mins at 30% power - this avoids agar boiling  over.
Let  cool until you can hold bottle in hand.
Add  antibiotics 1ul per 1ml.
3. Pour 10-15 mls of  molten agar into each plate (Fig A-3b). Stop just before the pool of agar  touches the edges of the plate. With practice you will learn how to judge the  proper amount by eye. Be careful to prevent the drip on the lip from running  down onto the contaminated outer glass.
4. Immediately after  pouring, cover the plates and use a firm circular motion to uniformly  distribute the agar over the plate. Be quick or the agar will solidify  before mixing.
5. Carefully slide the  plates to an undisturbed area of the bench to solidify. Once solidified, invert  the plates, place in sleeve and label well with tape.
