GFP Expression on Agar Plates
1. Use 15 ml M9 + Casamino Acid Plate in a container 2. Add 150 ul of 10X diluted overnight culture of OD600 2-3 3. Mix them well. 4. Transfer 7.5 ml of the inoculated media into two 60 mm petri dish. 5. When plate solidifies, cover one plate with aluminum foil and incubate at 37C 6. Take another 60 mm petri dish (spacer plate) and place it below the uncovered petri dish. 7. Align the spacer plate with the outline of the app in the tablet and tape them down securely. 8. Incubate the setup in 37C for 24 hours. 9. View plates under a blue light illuminator side by side to discern difference.
