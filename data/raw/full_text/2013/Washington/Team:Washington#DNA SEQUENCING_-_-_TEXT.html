DNA Sequencing
Add 10uL of miniprep DNA (at least 50ng/ul) + 5  uL of primer to a PCR Strip Tube. The only labels on the Tube should be AC01  ... ACXX (depending on the number of samples, XX)
Create a  COPY of the genewiz_premix document (in folder) and rename it with  today’s date.
Enter your DNA Name (make sure it is not  redundant and in order of wells you are submitting)
DNA Type --> "Plasmid" (click  the Type button to autofill the rest, same for all others)
DNA Length --> "6000kb"
Primer Name → i.e. "VF2" or "VR" (if you want forward or reverse, respectively)
Send Google doc to Advisor in sharing options.
Print out receipt (Send to an advisor and we can  print it out) and place labeled samples (AC01 ... ACXX) and order sheet in a  Plastic Bag and then Drop Box
When sequencing is completed you can view the  results by logging in going to the appropriate link under "Recent  Orders" on the lower right side of the screen
