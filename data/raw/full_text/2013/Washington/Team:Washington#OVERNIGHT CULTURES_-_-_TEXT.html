Preparation  of Overnight Cultures
Use TB  for making glycerol stocks and TB for minipreps.
Obtain a 14 mL Sterile Polypropylene Round-Bottom Tube.
Add ~ 3-5 mLs of an appropriate broth (either LB or  TB)* see tips
Add an appropriate antibiotic if necessary and set this tube  safely aside
Amp  (1:1000)
Chlor  (1:1000)
Kan  (1:1000)
Incubate overnight cultures @ 37oC, overnight in the iGEM labeled  shaker
General  Purpose Short Protocol:
Set-up  Time: 5 min
Total  Time: 12 - 24 hours (18 hours for best plasmid production)
1.  Label a 15 mL culture tube with strain/gene, antibiotic, and date.
2.  Add the following to tube as appropriate:
Reagent
Amount
Where to Find it
Broth (LB or TB)
3-5 mL (as needed)
Room temp or fridge stocks
Antibiotic(s)
1 uL/mL - Amp/Carb
1 uL/mL - Kan
1 uL/mL - Cm
1 uL/mL - Sp
-20 C Freezer or Refrigerator
Cells
1 colony
1 scrape from glycerol stock
10 uL liquid culture
Refrigerator
-80C Freezer
37C Incubator - Overnight culture
3. Gently mix, and place in 37C  shaker-incubator overnight, with lid attached loosely for good aeration.
*Broth:
The  type of broth used varies by the application.  If we are growing up cells  to miniprep, we typically use TB to get a higher OD of cells, though LB works  well for any other applications.  Broth that is pre-mixed with antibiotics  should be stored in the refrigerator for no longer than 2 months.
2013 UW  iGEM is using LB from capsules which has gelatin that will clog purification  columns. The TB should be made from powder.
