BioBricks and Parts
Here the sandbox of the parts we designed: not all of them have been submitted to the Registry, nor characterized. See the part page in the Registry or Experimental Data page for characterization results. Our cloning schemes can be found here, for the sensing population plasmid and for the storage population plasmid .
