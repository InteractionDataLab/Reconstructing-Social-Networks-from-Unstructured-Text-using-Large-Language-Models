Applications
Heavy metal pollution and its consequences on human health are an ever expanding issue, so we thought of two different applications for our Nickel accumulation device. The first one is about the integration of heavy-metal-removing bacteria in water purification plants, allowing metal removal via bioaccumulation in biomasses. The second one is about moving the accumulation system in a probiotic bacterium as a chassis, thus supplying an intestinal protection in nickel-allergic patients.
