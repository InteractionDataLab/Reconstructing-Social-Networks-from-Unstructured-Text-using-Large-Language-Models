SDS-Page protein gel analysis
An inta ct SDS PAGE electrophoresis sy stem should include: a  ta nk, lid with power ca bles,electrode a ssembly , cell buffer da m, ca sting sta nds, ca sting fra mes, combs(usua lly  10-wellor 15-well), a nd gla ss pla tes (thickness 0.75mm or 1.0mm or 1.5mm).The SDS PAGE gel in a  single electrophoresis run ca n be divided into sta cking gel a ndsepa ra ting gel. Sta cking gel (a cry la mide 5%) is poured on top of the sepa ra ting gel (a ftersolidifica tion) a nd a  gel comb is inserted in the sta cking gel. The a cry la mide percenta ge inSDS PAGE gel depends on the size of the ta rget protein in the sa mple:
Acry la mide %

7,00%
50 kDa - 500 kDa
10,00%
20 kDa - 300 kDa
12,00%
10 kDa - 200 kDa
15,00%
3 kDa - 100 kDa
Ma ke the separating gel:

Ta ke thegla ss pla tes out of the ca sting fra me a nd set them in the cell buffer da m. Pour the runningbuffer (electrophoresis buffer) into the inner cha mber a nd keep pouring a fter overflow untillthe buffer surfa ce rea ches the required level in the outer cha mber.
Prepa re the sa mples:
Mix y our sa mples with sa mple buffer (loa ding buffer). Hea t them in boiling wa ter for 5-10 min.
Loa d prepa red sa mples into wells a nd ma ke sure not to overflow. Don't forget loa ding protein ma rker into the first la ne. Then cover the top a nd connect the a nodes.
Set a n a ppropria te volt a nd run the electrophoresis when every thing's done.
As for the tota l running time, stop SDS-PAGE running when the downmost sign of theprotein ma rker (if no visible sign, inquire the ma nufa cturer) a lmost rea ches the foot line ofthe gla ss pla te.

Promptly eliminate the supernatant from each tube to keep then upside down on a piece of absorbent paper.
Wash the pellet with 250 ul of 70% cold ethanol. Make a tube at a time and hold it upside down.
Dry the pellet.
Resuspend in 30 ul of TE + RNase.
Preparation of a Sephadex Column
Take a 1 ml syringe, remove the needle and, using the plunger, pusha bit of cotton (taken from a pipette) on the bottom of the syringe,making it adhere well to the walls.
Using a Pasteur pipette, take the Sephadex* resin (well mixed) andplace it carefully in the column, from the bottom to the top, avoidingthe formation of air bubbles.
Place the column so loaded in a 15 ml tube on the bottom of which itwas filed an eppendorf without cap.
Centrifuge the column, placed in the collection system, at 1600 rpmfor 5 minutes at 4°C. Remove the eluate, recharge the column withnew resin up to the brim, then centrifuge. Repeat until the entirecolumn is occupied by the resin and uniformly packed.
Equilibrate the column with 100 ul of TE 1X and centrifuge at 1600rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. Then, empty the eppendorf on the bottom,load 100 ul of TE 1X and centrifuge always at 1600 rpm for 5 minutesat 4°C. Check the eluate volume and repeat the operation until the100 ul loaded will be exactly recovered at the bottom of the column,indicating that it is well balanced.
Add the sample.
*Preparation of a Sephadex Resin
Take a 500 ml bottle, pour 160 ml of sterile distilled water and 10 g ofSephadex G-50. Shake and leave to deposit the resin. Remove thesupernatant, containing dextrans, and add more sterile distilled water upto 160 ml. Repeat these washings until the supernatant is clear. After theremoval of the last supernatant, equilibrate the resin in TE 1X at pH 7,6(add TE 1X up to 160 ml) and autoclave for 15 minutes. Store at roomtemperature.
Protein-Metal-binding protocol + ICP-AES assay
First, the protein of interest must be overexpressed: it’s necessary to transform BL21 cells with the plasmid containing the gene (with his-tag) encoding the protein itself, and proceed with the normal protocol of induction with IPTG (see related protocol).
As a result the cells must be denatured.
The procedure continues with the protein purification on Ni-NTA resin (see related protocol).
Once isolated the eluate, proceed to its quantification by Bradford method (see related protocol).
Now go ahead with the incubation of the protein with the metal: the volumes of protein corresponding to 1, 5 and 10 ug have to be incubated with increasing concentrations of metal solution and incubation buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl), for a total volume of 100 ul.
Put the samples on wheel at 4°C overnight.
In order to eliminate the nickel excess, proceed with a molecular exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-25 resin (see related protocol).
The samples have to be analyzed by ICP-AES with a Thermo iCAP 6300 Radial ICP-OES.
