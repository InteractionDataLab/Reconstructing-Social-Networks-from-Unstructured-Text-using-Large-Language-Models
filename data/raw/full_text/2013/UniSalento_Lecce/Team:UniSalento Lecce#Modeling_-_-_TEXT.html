Modeling
Mathematical modeling is an indispensable component of synthetic biology, that allows to test the feasibility of new lab made biological systems, to save time on trials and errors. Our team tried to structure a model on MATLAB SynBiology software on the overall operation of the project. We afforded great difficulties to define the kinetic constants of the majority of the parts because a lot of them are not present in bibliography and need a long laboratory work to be defined.
Here you can find a PDF file containing the SCRIPT to be run in SynBiology.
