Project overview
1 - Background
Nickel is a very widespread heavy metal and its levels in waters and other environmental matrixes are highly related to human activities. A lot of industrial applications leads to an increase of nickel amounts in the environment, and the growing nickel contamination led to an increase in Nickel related allergies (more than the 15% of the population suffers from nickel allergy) and other pathologies concerning the reproductive, cardiac and respiratory systems. Furthermore, Nickel compounds have been classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC.
The risks for human health made it necessary, as for many heavy metals, to remove this metal from the environment. Nowadays nickel can be chemically removed from fluids using a chelating agent, known as H2DMG (dimethylglyoxime),which helps the precipitation of the nickel metal ions for its dosing and removal.
We thought of a living organism carrying a nickel sensing device, coupled via Quorum Sensing to a second system (i.e. another bacterial population) which will remove the nickel from the environment. Our two-population system could be implemented in a water purification plant, allowing a regulated heavy metal removal without the need of chemicals (see the Applications page).
2 - Nickel sensing
The sensing device is based on a set of genetic parts from the pathogen Helicobacter pylori. This microorganism, which colonises the stomach, requires a large amount of nickel to maintain its homeostasis in such a hard environment. Particularly, Ni++ ions are essential for Urease activity, the key enzyme for H.pylori survival in the acidic environment of the stomach, as well as for a respiratory hydrogenase. Urease makes up to 10% of the total cell protein synthesis, so that nickel homeostasis becomes an essential step for the pathogen survival.
2.1 - HpNikR: a pleiotropic regulator
Helicobacter controls this homeostasis through a nickel regulator, HpNikR, a homologue of NikRs from different bacterial species (including E.coli). However, in H.pylori NikR acts as a pleiotropic regulator, being a rare case of master switching regulator in bacteria. Its strong reliance on nickel concentrations and its multiple responsive elements, both positively or negatively controlled, make us think of developing a synthetic regulon for nickel sensing.
We cloned HpNikR from H.pylori strain G27 from the plasmid pET-NikR, sent us by prof. Alberto Danielli (from University of Bologna), the gene was cloned using the following primers (including Biobrick Prefix and Suffix, lowercase):
nikrFor: gtttcttcgaattcgcggccgcttctagATGGATACACCCAATAAAGACG
nikrRev: gtttcttcctgcagcggccgctactagtattattaCTATTCATTGTGTTCAAAG
(Here the PCR electrophoretic profile ). Thus we obtained BBa_K1151000 , and its derivative coding device, pLac-regulated BBa_K1151006 .
2.2 - HpNikR-controlled promoters
HpNikR, as said above, has multiple target promoters, some of them being upregulated, some being downregulated, in response to nickel concentration in the environment.
2.2.1 - Negative promoters
As shown above, nickel-bound NikR can downregulate the expression of various targets. We obtained a genomic region from H.pylori G27 containing a divergent operon with two NikR-regulated promoters. The plasmid was sent us again by prof. Alberto Danielli as pNKTB. The promoters control the expression of the exbBD operon (for siderophore uptake, called Pexb) and for nikR expression itself (PnikR). According to the functional segmentation of the divergent operon (as in Delany et al., see bibliography below), we tried to separate the promoters, using the following primers (including Biobrick Prefix and Suffix, lowercase):
IntergenicaFor: gtttcttcgaattcgcggccgcttctagagTGAGAAAAATCCTTTTTTG
pnikrev: gtttcttcctgcagcggccgctactagtaTGAGAAAAATCCTTTTTTG
pnikfor: gtttcttcgaattcgcggccgcttctagagAATTCAAACGCTCTTATG
pexbfor: gtttcttcgaattcgcggccgcttctagagACTGGATTTAAATGGTTG
pexbrev:gtttcttcctgcagcggccgctactagtaGCACCCTATAAGAAGGCATC
(Here the PCR Results ) So we obtained the whole divergent operon  and Pexb and Pnikr. These promoters were cloned upstream of BBa_E0240 , becoming parts BBa_K1151009 , BBa_K1151010 , BBa_K1151011 .
Here you can see (link to experimental data) characterisation data for BBa_K1151036 and BBa_K1151038 : constructs made up by the promoters cloned upstream of GFP cds together with BBa_K1151006 , HpNikR coding device.
2.2.2 - Positive promoter
We also tried a positively-regulated promoter, from UreABCDE operon (PureA). We got it synthetised from IDT, obtaining BBa_K1151005 .
We weren't able to characterise BBa_K1151005 activity.
3 - Storage system
The second part of our project aimed to develop a bacterial population able to store nickel, basing its activity on the Hpn protein from H. pylori and a Quorum Sensing signalling: this last natural process is the basis of interaction between the two bacterial communities. The storage system of our design allows to accumulate the metal by bioconcentration: once accumulation occurred, it is necessary to dispose of the bacterial biomass containing the metal. See the Applications page for a design of purification plant implementation.
3.1 - Hpn protein
Hpn is an histidine-rich protein whose role is to store Nickel ions in the cytoplasm of Helicobacter. In conditions of Nickel starvation, this protein supplies the ions to the nickel-dependent machineries. We thought we can use this protein to make E.coli accumulate nickel. Hpn has been demonstrated not to be toxic even if highly induced in this heterologous system (Ge et al., see Bibliography). Hpn coding sequence has been synthetised by IDT , and submitted as BBa_K1151001 , and its derivative translational unit BBa_K1151004 , generator BBa_K1151025 and coding device BBa_K1151013 . We weren't able to characterise these parts activities.
4 - Nickel-dependent Quorum Sensing Network
At first, our project was designed to work on a single plasmid, for both the sensing and metal-accumulation functions. To increase the safety of our device, giving more control to the human operator, we chose to divide the two phases of the project into two different bacterial populations. The activation of the storage depends on the activation of the sensing population. So, in order to integrate the two systems,  we exploited the mechanism of intercellular communication of Quorum Sensing. Evaluating the effectiveness of operation of various QS BioBricks present in the Registry, we chose BBa_K805016 , BBa_C0261 and BBa_R0062 , from Alivibrio fischerii, based and dependent on the synthesis of AHLs as signaling molecules.
In our system, the communication start is Ni2+ and IPTG dependent, both necessary for the synthesis of HpNikR , the genic master regulator which activates the translation of LuxI, the QS inducer. The LuxI protein catalyzes the synthesis of [N-]acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), the signalling molecule, from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in the sensing population. Quorum sensing molecules reach the other bacterial population by diffusion.
Here we built a system designed on the principle of positive feedback. In fact, the storage population integrates the gene LuxR within the plasmid we designed: LuxR codes for the receiver protein. Placing the transcription of the LuxI gene under the control of the promoter LuxPR, we obtained an AHL signal amplification phenomenon.
Under the same promoter and within the same synthetic operon we also placed the gene of the nickel-binding protein, Hpn , thereby  obtaining a triple control of the protein synthesis process in the accumulator population, that depends upon the concentrations of Ni2+, IPTG and AHLs.
