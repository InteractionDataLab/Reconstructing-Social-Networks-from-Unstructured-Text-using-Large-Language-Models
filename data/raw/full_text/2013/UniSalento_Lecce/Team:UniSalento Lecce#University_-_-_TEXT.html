Lecce
Our University is located in Lecce, a sunny town in Apulia, in the South of Italy. Known around the world for its Baroque style, Lecce offers a great scenario with its artistic views, and a good life for students and young people. Furthermore, anywhere you turn around, you can find our wonderful fields and our amazing coasts, with the most appreciated beaches in Italy, from the rocky Adriatic coasts to the smooth sandy beaches of the Ionian sea.
