Overnight liquid cultures were setup for colonies 2, 4, 5 and 11. 
Miniprep was performed on these cultures alongside eGFP-pDRIVE colonies 1-4. This gave good yields and the plasmids were sent for sequencing. This showed eGFP-pDRIVE no. 4 and eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 no. 17 was correct!

Cloning and transformation of eGFP-pBBR1MCS-2 using plasmid no. 4 (mentioned just above). The transformation only gave rise to 2 colonies, thus suggesting the cloning to be unsuccessful. The cloning was repeated and transformation was carried out again. Colony PCR was performed alongside MamC-pJET (see gel below).

Liquid cultures were setup from eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 no. 2, 4, 5, 11, 17 for 2 hours in order to  measure fluorescence. First, OD(600nm) was measured to ensure equal density of cells. The measurements did not show fluorescence (ex. 450 nm, em. 495 nm) from the cultures.

Cloning and transformation of MamC-pDRIVE. Colony PCR showed the cloning to be of cryptic success. Colony PCR was redone without success.

Colony PCR using MamC primer was done with MS-1 and MSR-1 colonies. MamC was amplified from the genomic DNA. This did not give rise to any bands via gel electrophoresis. 
MamC was, however, successfully amplified from MSR-1 later in the week (see gel below).

All MamC sequences were perfect while all eGFP sequences were wrong. The cloning of eGFP into pDRIVE was successfully redone (documentation lost). Fluorescence was also measured of eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 strains. No fluorescence detected as the sequencing explains. Inducing with IPTG (final conc. 1 mM) had no effect.

Enrichment of magnetotactic bacteria was done according to the protocol. It was unclear whether the bacteria observed in the microscope were actually magnetotactic. They were compared to MS-1 and MSR-1 samples.

Since we couldn't detect any fluorescence from eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 we needed troubleshoot this. We found a frameshift in the vector and thus we repeated the cloning of eFbFP into pBBR1MCS-2. This was done alongside cloning eGFP into pBBR1MCS-2. Transformation and colony PCR were carried out. All colonies appeared to be positive on the gel electrophoresis (see picture below).

MamC-pJET did not contain the restriction sites we needed. Therefore, the whole procedure for obtaining MamC-pJET was repeated using other primers (with different overhangs).


</P></DIV><DIV class="right_page"><P> 
Six of each genotype were set up for liquid cultures overnight (colonies 1, 2, 6, 9, 13, 16 for eFbFP and 18, 19, 23, 25, 27, 31 for eGFP). Miniprep was done and samples were sent for sequencing. None of the eFbFP gave rise to good quality sequencing. Colonies 18, 19, 23 and 27 of eGFP contained the correct sequence. 

Empty pBBR1MCS-2 vector was transformed into E. cloni in order to obtain more stock vector. 
<U>Culturing of MTBs</U>
MSR-1 base medium culture was inoculated in new medium and put in 28 degrees shaker over the weekend. This was done to check whether the strain would grow aerobically as well.

Plasmids from last week eFbFP/eGFP-pBBR1MCS-2 were digested alongside the newly assembled MamC-pJET in order to assess whether the restriction sites were present or not (see gel no. 1).

All lanes with eGFP or MamC were positive (see gel above) and the bands were purified from the gel. From this purification very poor concentration was obtained. From the lanes with eFbFP, no. 6 stands out from the negative control. Therefore we decided we continue working with this plasmid. A re-ligation of eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 was performed. 

Cloning of MamC into linearized eGFP-pBBR1MCS-2 and subsequently transforming the plasmid was also done. Colony PCR was carried out on MamC-eGFP-pBBR1MCS-2 and eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2. We decided to use the Gateway (GTW) system to express our constructs (see gel no. 2). 
To save time the colony PCR was performed using gateway primers (MamC F and eGFP R, eFbFP F and R). The PCR product of MamC-eGFP-pBBR1MCS-2 colonies 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and eFbFP-pBBR1MCS-2 3, 7, 10, 13, 15 were PCR purified.

Microscopy of MSR-1 in order to check morphology is corresponding to what is reported in the literature (Jogler &amp; SchÃ¼ler, Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009. 63:501-21). We did not see any signs of bacterial growth in the liquid cultures set up in week 6.

Cultures of eFbFP-pJAM1786 was minipreped and samples were sent for sequencing. Microscopy revealed MamC-eGFP-pJAM1786 and eFbFP-pJAM1786 emitted fluorescence. To measure fluorescence quantitatively, we set up 8 liquid cultures of MamC-eGFP-pJAM1786 and 3 of MamC-pSB1C3 as a non-fluorescent control. Fluorescence was measured for dilutions 1X, 2X, 5X, 10X, 50X (Ex. 485 nm em. 535 nm.) using an ELISA reader (black plate) and gave rise characterization for BioBrick BBa_K1094401. 
OD(600nm) was also measured to ensure approx. equal cell density.  
<U>BioBrick submission</U>
Miniprep was performed and samples sent for sequencing. The sequencing results revealed that sequences of  MamC-pSB1C3, eGFP(18)-pSB1C3


</P></DIV><DIV class="right_page"><P> 
and eGFP(19)-pSB1C3 were correct while eFbFP-pSB1C3 held the wrong insert. We uncovered that this was due two &quot;illegal&quot; restriction sites in the FbFP sequence. We, therefore, ordered another synthetic gene from IDT with the restriction sites removed. 
To submit MamC-eGFP as a BioBrick we PCR amplified (1:20 min elongation time) the whole construct (MamC F primer and eGFP R primer). To do this we used 3 different templates. 
Afterwards, digestion and ligation into pSB1C3 was performed and the plasmid was transformed into E. coli.

Miniprep was carried out on the frozen pellets from last week. LR reaction was setup to yield eGFP-pJAM1786 and eFbFP-pJAM1786. Colony PCR was performed. 

Looking at the bands from the Colony PCR, one can tell that there might have been problems with the gel. We decided to consider the odd looking bands in the left to be due to the gel and therefore we inoculated the restreaked cultures into liquid LB. 

Using an opaque ELISA reader plate we measured fluorescence of 7 eGFP-pJAM1786 and 6 eFbFP-pJAM1786 cultures
</P></DIV><DIV class="right_page"><P> 
(3 control cultures, containing pBBR1MCS-2 without insert, were used as well).
The measurements failed to show  eFbFP-pJAM1786 to be significantly different from the control cultures. This was in contrast to eGFP-pJAM1786 that was shown be fluorescent. 

Western blot was performed on the 3 strains above (eFbFP, eGFP and control), MamC-eGFP-pJAM1786 and a GFP control. Strangly, the MamC-eGFP-pJAM1786 cultures did not show fluorescence. This was highly unexpected since the cultures that was used for this glycerol stock earlier had been shown to be fluorescent. Therefore, we did not expect any bands in the MamC-eGFP lanes. 

The western blot somewhat failed since only one of the standard protein markers showed in the membrane. (See a visualization <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/8/83/UNIK_Copenhagen_Notebook_ref_Western.jpg
" target="_blank">here</A>). The GFP standard (band at the right side) seem to be highly overloaded. The lanes to left is eGFP-pJAM in different amounts.
