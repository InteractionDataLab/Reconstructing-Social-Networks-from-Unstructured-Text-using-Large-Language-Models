Team Magneto - the iGEM Copenhagen Team 2013
Our team consist of 11 various people from the field of bioscience. We spent the spring preparing and the summer working on our project, Magnetotaxic bacteria. Being a diverse group gave us the advantage to think independently while still working together. Everyone has contributed equally, each with his or her own individual skillset, even outside the lab. Overall, we had a very successful team work and we are very proud to be part of this group.
