The Danish Collaboration
Since the very beginning of this year's iGEM, the Danish teams have engaged in a collaboration. The small size of our country provides an excellent opportunity to gather all the teams of the kingdom. The three Danish teams used this opportunity to arrange two workshops.
Workshop at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) - 08/03-10/03
The first workshop was held at DTU. This was rather early in the process as the teams had just been formed. The topics of the weekend included: tutorial in USER cloning, how to use the iGEM registry, fundraising and beer and pizza :)
Workshop at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) - 31/08-1/09
Just before term started at the Danish universities, SDU hosted another workshop for all the Danish teams. This was a time to share stories and experiences from the past two month of iGEMing. Besides various team building exercises, the topics included: troubleshooting workshop, poster session, presentation session and beer and pizza :)
