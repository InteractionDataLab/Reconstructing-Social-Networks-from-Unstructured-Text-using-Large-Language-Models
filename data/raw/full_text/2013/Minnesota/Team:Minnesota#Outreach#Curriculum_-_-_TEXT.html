We focused our outreach efforts this year on three different areas. First, in an effort to raise awareness and interest regarding synthetic biology amongst youths, we developed a middle-school synthetic biology curriculum. Second, we started a synthetic biology club at our school. Finally, to increase interest in molecular biology within the public we created a series of six second science videos.
