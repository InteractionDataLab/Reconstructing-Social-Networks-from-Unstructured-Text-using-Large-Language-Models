The ECORI Squad (Educating Communities On Research Innovation) launched pilot curriculum on hands-on research to over 150 middle school students. The curriculum was designed to keep students engaged, attentive, and on the edge of their seats! The iGEM team also initiated a campus life program dedicated to fostering a society of synthetic biologists. This program is a group of students who will inspire recruitment for iGEM, hold discussions on recent synthetic biology advances, and carry forward the curriculum developed by the ECORI squad.
