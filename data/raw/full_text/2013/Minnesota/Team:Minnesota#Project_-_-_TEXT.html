The 2013 University of Minnesota iGEM team aims to produce active human insulin by designing a versatile expression system in the industrially-relevant yeast, Pichia pastoris.  The team will construct several novel expression systems and employ methanol-based induction systems using the standardized, modular design of the BioBricks systems. As well as this, the team will use cross-kingdom conjugation to advance the genetic toolkit available for transformation and expression in Pichia.  Ultimately, we will utilize our system to produce active insulin as a proof-of-concept.
