To test if the lesson plans would be effective, ECORI visited Salk Middle School in Elk River, Minnesota, taught five classes and reached out to over 150 students. The lesson plan consisted of two days of hands-on experiments, coupled with brief interactive lectures.   The first day, the ECORI Squad introduced students to synthetic biology. The initial activity we instructed students on how to extract DNA from strawberries using household items. Next, the students were able to experience making art with colorful modified organisms by plating bacteria on agar plates in any design of their choosing. The bacterial organism we used were bioluminescent, fluorescent green, fluorescent red, and blue (particular strains can be found in our curriculum handbook [have handbook link out to PDF of synbio curriculum.)  We explained to students proper protocol for handling and disposing of genetically modified organisms, along with proper aseptic technique, and lab safety procedures.  We then brought students together to conclude the curriculum for Day 1.   Our second day at Salk Middle School, students were radiating with excitement (much like the bacterial plates they would view later on!) We started the day with a brief lecture on restriction enzymes, and how they are used to manipulate DNA. We introduced the concept of BioBricking plasmids, and let the students learn hands on how to construct different vectors from plasmid components. This activity was an exercise of logic, and the students grasped the concept very readily! After the students correctly designed the target vector, they were asked what functions they inserted into their bacterial plasmids. Some examples produced by the students were:<UL><LI>Do my homework!</LI><LI>Eat trash, while still smelling good</LI><LI>Drive a Lamborghini</LI><LI>Target “sick cells” and make them glow, making them easier to detect</LI><LI>Play videogames!</LI><LI>Make clothes</LI></UL>   We explained that some of the ideas are far-fetched, but some of the vector designs that they came up with are actual research projects that are being worked on at the University of Minnesota! The students were very innovative in their thought process, and demonstrated how much they had learned in their two days of lecture. Below is a collage of drawings we collected from students prior to having any lecture, and an after picture we collected after 
the conclusion of their 100 minutes of learning about synthetic biology.   Finally, we concluded the session with a Q and A in which students could ask us whatever they wanted about synthetic biology. We addressed questions proposed by students concerning human trials, or potential environment issues. We answered these questions by engaging students in an ethical conversation. We had originally developed a discussion session exclusively regarding bioethics, but deemed it inappropriate for the level of philosophy taught in middle schools. 
In order for this curriculum to suit an older age group, the ethics portion would contain discussion about what we can innovate using synthetic biology, and what would be better left alone. We would engage students with the following questions:<UL><LI>Where should we draw the line concerning manipulating human genetics?
   </LI><LI>How would modified organisms be responsibly controlled?
   </LI><LI>What would be the impact of introducing genetically altered organisms into a preexisting ecosystem?
