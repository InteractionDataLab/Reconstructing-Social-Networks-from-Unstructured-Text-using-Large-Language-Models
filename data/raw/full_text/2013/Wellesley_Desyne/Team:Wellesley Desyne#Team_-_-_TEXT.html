Wellesley HCI iGEM 2013
Joanna Bi, Wellesley College '15
Joanna is a rising junior at Wellesley College majoring in computer science and minoring in      economics. She enjoys programming and problem solving, and loves      collaborating with other people to expand her imagination. Outside the lab, she loves swimming,      literature, and film, especially The Lord of the Rings!
Joanna's Notebook
Evan Segreto, Wellesley College '15
Evan is a rising junior Computer Science and Philosophy double-major at Wellesley College. This is      their first year at the lab, and they're especially excited about the integration of visual art,      social science, and computer science. When not coding or philosophizing, Evan can usually be found      making art or playing Ultimate Frisbee.
Evan's Notebook
Heather Petrow, Wellesley College '14
Heather is a rising senior studying MAS and Computer Science. This is her first year in the lab, and she is excited to learn more about HCI and participate in inter-disciplinary collaboration. Previously an art student, she serendipitously discovered Computer Science, and is interested in the conceptual applications of next-generation technology. Heather likes to spend her free time reading and taking herself to movie matinees.

Sravanti Tekumalla, Wellesley College '16
Sravanti is a rising sophomore planning to major in Computer Science and Mathematics. This is her      first year working in the Human-Computer Interaction lab, and she's excited about applying her      computer science skills to benefit the synthetic biology community and finding innovative ways to      make interaction with computers more intuitive. When not working in the lab, Sravanti can be found      reading, playing piano, or relaxing by Lake Waban.

Casey Grote, Wellesley College '14
Casey is a senior, MAS major at Wellesley college.  Casey has been with the lab since summer      2011, and is excited about the intersection between hardware and user experience, open source      computing and breaking computers. Casey is the official designer for the iGEM team. Casey designed                                         the BAC to the Future, zTree, and team logos as well as the website!
Casey's Notebook
Tiffany Chen, Wellesley College '13
Tiffany majored in Biological Sciences. After three years of biology wet lab research, she is now interested in exploring research in synthetic biology from the computer science side of things. In her free time, she enjoys hanging out with friends, reading, writing, playing video games, and occasionally exercising.

Cassie Hoef, Wellesley College '15
Cassie is a rising junior studying Computer Science as well as Medieval and Renaissance Studies.      This is her first year working in the lab, and is excited about learning about graphics and      3D interfaces. She spent her time developing zTree and organizing the social activities for the team!                                         In addition, Cassie successfully mentored several interns which quickly became assets to the team.

Catherine Guo, Wellesley College '13
Catherine graduated from Wellesley last semester with a degree in Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences.      She is interested in hearing the user's perspective on emerging technologies, and applying their      input to make technology more accessible. As a linguist, she is particularly interested in making      user interfaces understandable to technophobes. She is an aspiring polyglot and self-proclaimed      japanophile.
