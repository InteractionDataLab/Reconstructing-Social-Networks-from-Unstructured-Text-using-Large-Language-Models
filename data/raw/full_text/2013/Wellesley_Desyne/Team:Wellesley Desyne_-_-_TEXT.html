MEDAL FULFILLMENT
Wellesley HCI iGEM 2013
Synthetic biology requires a multidisciplinary, collaborative design environment to engineer      the complex biological systems of the future.
Our team created a collection of software tools which      address specific technical synthetic biology challenges while simultaneously advancing the way in      which users interact with computing environments. Our software will support the workflow of the      scientific process by supporting various steps: research, brainstorming, building, testing, troubleshooting,      iteration, and analysis. The combination of human computer interaction, bio-design automation, and      experimental design makes our effort unique in the iGEM experience and closes the loop on the      design-build-test methodology.
