Gold
Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the                              results that were obtained.
We worked closely with the BU and MIT iGEM teams throughout our process and tested Eugenie with these teams as well as with Wellesley students.
Use SBOL in your software documentation.
Both Eugenie and zTree incorporate SBOL symbols into their user interfaces.
Build upon existing software from a previous iGEM competition found on the The Registry of Software Tools.
We utilize Eugene in the implementation of Eugenie .
We also access the Registry of Biological Parts and the iGEM archives.
We draw upon MoClo Planner in the design and implementation of Eugenie.
Outline and detail how your software affects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology
We applied user-centered design methodology and conducted extensive user research .
We discuss safety considerations in our research.
We designed and implemented Bac to the Future to communicate key ideas about synthetic biology to a wider audience.

Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool.

Eugenie
Bac To The Future
Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.
We developed Eugenie , which supports the research phase of the synthetic biology workflow as our core team project. Our complementary tool is zTree .
Provide a demonstration of software as a video tutorial on wiki.
Video tutorials can be found on our downloads and tutorials page
