Press the play button at the top center of the Unity interface to run the program.
NOTE: Once you build it, you should have an .exe file, which means the program will be able to run on Windows machines only. After an executable is generated there should be a data file that has the same name but says data that saves to the same place as zTree saves to. That data file must be in the same location as the .exe file at all times.
