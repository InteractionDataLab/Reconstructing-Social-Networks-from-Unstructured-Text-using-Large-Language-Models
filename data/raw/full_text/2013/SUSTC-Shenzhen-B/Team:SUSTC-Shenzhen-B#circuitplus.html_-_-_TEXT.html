Introduction
Circuit+, an online registry of standard genetic circuits, aims to fill the vacancy of genetic circuits’ database and sharing platform. In the database behind, we design several tables to record all kinds of information to comprehensively describe a genetic circuit. All the information we record and require in Create is based on our standard of RFC 97 and RFC 101. Users can retrieve circuits, browse information, share by exporting information in SBOL and submit new circuits. As for sharing platform, we call for users to submit their own genetic circuits and post their comment of other circuits. Furthermore, even average people are allowed and encouraged to upload their crazy ideas to Mindmap. Thus, Circuit+ is a good place for exchanging genetic circuits and obtaining a better understanding about synthetic biology.
Feature
Mindmap
Mindmap is a most interesting way to do retrieving, and actually it’s more than that. By clicking bubbles one and another, you can go into a deeper level of the classification and eventually find some circuits. You can use this way to have an overlook of circuits we have here and get some idea about synthetic biology. And most importantly, it can work as a medium of brainstorm. In fact, the first version of Mindmap was the result of our brainstorm when we were collecting previous iGEM projects. The classification in Mindmap is now somewhat different. It is idea-driven and can make you to think more. If you are freshman to synthetic biology, you can find it useful to spend some time in Mindmap.
SBOL supported
The information of circuit can be exported in form of SBOL, which can simplify the job of sharing and data exchanging. The SBOL in our software is an extension of core SBOL and it can record additional information that defined in the RFC 97.
LGD
LGD, short for logical genetic diagram, can utilize an algorithm behind to draw a dynamic diagram of genetic circuit. It is a powerful tool to show the structure of circuit and regulatory relations between parts. And the concept of circuit and the important role of regulatory relations in our software are coordinate with our Technical Standard RFC 97 and RFC 101.
Feedback and comment
We genuinely call for you to give experience feedback and comment about circuits. Feedback is experience that users want to express and share after trying our Circuit+. Those experiences can tell the feeling after repeating experiments from a perspective of users, not uploader. The proposed feedback must be checked by professional users before displayed.  If you haven’t tested this circuit by yourself, you can still comment on it in your opinion.
Sharing by uploading
Sharing is most important to a dynamic database. Circuit+ provides a good way to encourage sharing circuits by submitting. In create page, users are supposed to fill out a form about their circuit and submit it. Users can also import some information in form of SBOL. The method can be found in tutorial. Not every blank in the form is a strictly required. Users can feel free to fill the least required ones and can always change or complement the information later. Both the information submitted and edited must be audited by professional level users to ensure quality. And when the information can be put on the website, you can get an email from the software.
Other features
Diverse retrieving ways
Circuit+ provides simple accesses to find circuits in the database, Search Box, Circuit List and Mindmap.
Online software
There is no need to worry downloading and configuration.
User-friendly interface
Simple and elegant, Circuit+ can make users settled and pleased.
APIs
Circuit+ provides APIs to which other developers are able to access.
