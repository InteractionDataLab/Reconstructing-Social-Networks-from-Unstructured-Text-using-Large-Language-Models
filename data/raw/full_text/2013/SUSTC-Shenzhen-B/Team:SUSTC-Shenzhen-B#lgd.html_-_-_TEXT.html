Introduction
Short for logical genetic designer, LGD is an online computer aided genetic circuit designer. LGD has two major features: 1, it is online! Unlike other computer aided graphical designing program such as TinkerCell，Our LGD is an online software. 2, it is integrated into the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit. Every project in the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit comes with a LGD design, users can make their own modification and improvement in the original design.
Tutorial
LGD can be access from the Registry of Standard Genetic Circuit. When you go to the “circuit” page of a project, click the "View and edit in LGD".
LGD is constitute with the control panel and the coding frame panel on the left.
Let take the project “A Synthetic Genetic EdgeDetection Program (Eco900_00)” for example, if we want to add a newcodingframe in the existing gene circuit just click “Add new codingframe” button. Then you will get a new coding framing:
Adding a part by clicking
.
Select the biobrick type you want, and add to the coding frame.
Other features: you can move the entire coding frame to any position:
Save you project to your local disk:
Have fun!
