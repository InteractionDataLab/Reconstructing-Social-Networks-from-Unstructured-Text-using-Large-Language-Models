Special Thanks
Zhu Baoting
Prof. Zhu Baoting is a molecular pharmacology expert, national one thousand progrom selected, the current south university of science and technology of biology professor leader. He has learned about our software and put forward a lot of useful Suggestions and instructions.
SUSTC-Shenzhen-A
SUSTC-Shenzhen-A is our Brother Team this year. They helped us with entering several papers and help adding them to our database.
SUSTC-Shenzhen-B 2012
SUSTC-Shenzhen-B 2012 helped us to prepare the video materials. We really appreciate Zishan Wu, Kangjie Chu, Yuyang Wu, Jiaxin Sun. Without their works, we could not make this open course video.
BGI
BGI was founded in Beijing on Sept 9th, 1999 with the mission of supporting the development of science and technology, building strong research teams, and promoting the development of scientific partnership in genomics field. BGI Shenzhen organized a small party for iGEM teams in Guangdong on which we had our first project sharing.
HKUST
HKUST - A dynamic, international research university, in relentless pursuit of excellence, leading the advance of science and technology, and educating the new generation of front-runners for Asia and the world. HKUST is the first iGEM team that tasted our software. Though our software is not as completed as this time, HKUST has made a suggestion of the LGD structure and the idea of operating the community.
Genome Compiler
Genome Compiler is built on the idea that biology is information technology. We can design and program living things the same way that we design computer code. Genetic designers today are still writing in 1s and 0s – they lack the missing tools to design, debug, and compile the biological code into new living things. We have send an email to Genome Compiler asking for coding methods skills for Genome editing, Genome Compiler replied us timely, and offered us good suggestions.
SUSTC
The South University of Science and Technology of China (SUSTC) is a public university governed by Guangdong Province; it is established and funded by the Shenzhen Municipality. Thinks to SUSTC providing us working conditions.
