When back to school in March, each group were supposed to give a presentation of what they had learned during the winter holiday every Monday and Thursday. In this way, we cooperated to learn basic knowledge of synthetic biology.</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>Mar/2013</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>We had our first brainstorm, the organizer asked us to come up with fantastic ideas no matter if they are practical. At that time, we hardly knew anything about synthetic biology, but it did not bother us to have bats in the belfry.</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>Mar/2013</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>We moved from Journal Club to Project Review. Each of us picked one iGem project in which he/she was interested and went over it in spare time. Still in Monday and Thursday, 6 students every time, we talked about the projects we chose and shared them. During this time, some students left us with various reasons, which is quite a pity.</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>Mar/2013</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>We were divided into dry lab and wet lab.</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>04.04.10</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>We had our second brainstorm.

The last member, Yi Wan, recovered from pulmonary tuberculosis and joined us. First, we discussed and redefined our LGD, we want to make a CAD to modularize elements in genetic circuit and our advisor gave some precious comments. In order to achieve our goal, we decided to review the wet lab projects again. Then, we compared web page and native application and all agreed to adapt web2.0. Finally, we made a rule that everyone of us should do presentation at least once and the first pair is Xiaodan Zhu and Huiyu He</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>16/07/2013</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>Meeting again.

After that, we were separated into 3 groups. Xiaodan Zhu and Huiyu He work for the interface part, Hanrun Li and Liqun Zhou work for the algorithm part and rest of us work for the database. START WORKING!</P></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>21/07/2013</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><P>We went to BGI for communication together with the wet lab team.
