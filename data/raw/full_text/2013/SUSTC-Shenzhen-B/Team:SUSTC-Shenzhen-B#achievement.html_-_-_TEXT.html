Below are requirements and our achievements.

Bronze Medal requirement
Requirement
Achievement
1.Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
We really enjoyed the whole summer of learning, coding, debating and laghing. You can also see our about us page of wiki.
2.Create and share a description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.
Thank you for watching our wiki now!
3.Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Believe us, we will do it!
4.Develop and make available via The Registry of Software Toolsan open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on-BioBrick standard biological parts (remember, the iGEM judges will be looking for substantial team-based software projects).
our software is open source and all the code has already upload to github, you may clone it by GitHub~ . allright it is also based on standard biobricks. check it out in our software !
Silver Medal requirement
To earn a Silver Medal, in addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, a team must :
Requirement
Achievement
1a. Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool
See future part of this wiki.
OR
1b. Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.
Our main primary software project is Circuit+, an genetic circuit database and registry.
As well, we have put Circuit List , which is Clotho verion of Circuit+.
Also we developed the Synthetic Biology Laboratory Manager, for the management of synthetic biology lab, such as our wet team
2.Provide a demonstration of their software either as a textual or video tutorial made available on their wiki. This tutorial should explain all the features of the tool as well as provide sample input and output as appropriate.
See tutorial part of this wiki.
Glod Medal requirement
To earn a Gold Medal, in addition to the Silver Medal requirements, a team must:
Requirement
Achievement
1. Have another team utilized the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained?
The SUSTC-Shenzhen-A has used our LGD in designing their own circuits. see their wiki for how they are using our software: Team A .
The Tsinghua-E team has used our software for brainstorming. They trained they freshman students using circuitplus, and they told us that circuitplus is very informatic, and they will continue use it in future. Meanwhile, they propose that they can develop circuitplus 2.0 in collaborating with us.
Team Peking, team HKUST, team CUHK and team Macquarie_Australia also used our software, see their feedback here: feedback .
2a. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
One of the key points of Circuit+ is to promote sharing gene circuits. And using Mindmap, we can popularize synthetic biology from specialists to average people by asking them thinking of crazy ideas and put them on Mindmap. Meanwhile, using Mindmap to present circuits is one kind of innovation. So Sharing is what we hope to push heigher in synthetic biology. You can nearly share every thing while working for synthetic biology via circuit+ !!!
OR
2b. In place of requirement two, a team may instead use SBOL in your software documentation.
Circuit+ supports importing and exporting data in form of SBOL. here is an example
3a. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports one of the following: 1.  design of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 2.  construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 3.  characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 4.  the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices; 5.  the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
We have two technical standards RFC101 RFC97 to define gene circuits and logical gene gate.
OR
3b. Build upon existing software from a previous iGEM competition found on the The Registry of Software Tools
This year we put TTEC into Clotho. TTEC is last year’s project of SUSTC-Shenzhen-B, and we made it available in the Clotho platform.
