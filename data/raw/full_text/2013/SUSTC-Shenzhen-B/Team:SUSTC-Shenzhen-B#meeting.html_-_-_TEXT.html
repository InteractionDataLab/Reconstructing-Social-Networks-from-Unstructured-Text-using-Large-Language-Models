Meeting
Summary
With the spirit of communication, our team members had several communication activities with other igem teams, including attending BGI workshop, visiting Team Hong_Kong_HKUST and Team Hong_Kong_CUHK. While visiting other teams, we exchanged our opinions and discussed our projects more deeply. Eventually we have learned a lot from these communication activities and gained many constructive perspectives to improve our project.
Attending the Workshop arranged by BGI IGEM team
On May 26th , Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B attended the Workshop arranged by Shenzhen-BGI IGEM team. Seven iGEM teams attended this workshop, including Team Shenzhen BGIC 0101, Shenzhen BGIC ATCG, SCUT, SYSU-China, SYSU-Software, SUSTC-Shenzhen-B and SUSTC-Shenzhen-A. All the teams presented their projects and shared their opinions to each other.And we got great help and lots of good advice from this communication.

Visiting Team Hong Kong HKUST
In mid-July Boyu Qie, one of our advisors, wrote an email to Professor Chow, the instructor of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST, and expressed we hoped to have a communication activity with Team Hong_Kong_HKUST. Professor Chow was pretty nice and welcomed us go to HKUST and have an open communication. Therefore, on August 18h, all our teammates went to Hong_Kong and had a pleasant discussion with the members of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST.

Both teams gave a presentation of their project and introduced their team members. Then we expressed our opinions on each other’s projects and discussed our projects in depth level. And the opinions of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST is really beneficial for the further improvment of our software.

Visiting Team Hong Kong CUHK
Our communication with Team Hong_Kong_HKUST was very helpful to us. So we contacted the team leader of Team Hong_Kong_CUHK and organized another outreach communication on August 24h. In this communication activity, we also met our old friends, some members of Team Hong_Kong_HKUST. We had a depth-level discussion that afternoon.

Asking feedbacks from other Asian iGEM teams
After finishing our software, we have sent emails to many Asian iGEM team to invite them to use our software, submit their project information into our database and hope that they can feedback some suggestions on our software.
