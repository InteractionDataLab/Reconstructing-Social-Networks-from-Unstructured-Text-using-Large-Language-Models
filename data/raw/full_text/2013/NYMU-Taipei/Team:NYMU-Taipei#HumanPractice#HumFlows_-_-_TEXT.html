Teaching the iGEM newcomers in an efficient way!
Some of iGEM teams face problems such as lacking in experienced member nor well instructors. The problem would probably prevent them from joining iGEM nor fall in love with synthetic biology! So we brained out a way that would give a hand for these ardent young scientists - We provide an easier way to teach newcomers doing wet lab experiments by making videos. We uploaded the videos on youtube and posted our own protocols that have been well-modified on the internet, this make sure everyone who is interested in iGEM can get the knowledge of doing wet lab experiments by simply watching our videos and read our protocols. We hope that the pay-out could give them a little help and could encourage them adhere to their dream.
Interested in our project? Just Link To Our Videos XD!!
