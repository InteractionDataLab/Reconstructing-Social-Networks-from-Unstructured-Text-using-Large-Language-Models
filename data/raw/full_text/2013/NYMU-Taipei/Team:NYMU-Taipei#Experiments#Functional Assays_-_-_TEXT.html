Notes
In this page, we list all the functional assays that we have done with summarized results.
For combined and organized sets of our results, see our Data page .
2013-07-29
Scale: long term (25ml), samples retrieved from 2 to 6 hours once every 30 minutes.
Items: E0240, E0240+H2O2, pLac+E0840, pLac+I13507, pNHaA+E0240, pLac+I13507+H2O2 on pSB1A2 backbone
medium: M9 minimal medium
Measuring: OD600 measured in a cuvette via spectrometer, fluorescence 485/525 (GFP) and 584/607 (RFP) in ELISA plate reader
Results: the strength of NHaA promotor is so weak that we decided to switch our safety biobrick to the next design.
2013-08-02
Purpose: Finding the suitable range of H2O2 concentration to test our promoters.
Items: pLac+E0840 with 8 different H2O2 concentrations (OmM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 5mM, 10mM, 50mM) on pSB1A2 backbone
Testing: Both OD600 and fluorescence 485/525 (GFP) both measured using the ELISA plate reader.
Results:
MG1655 dies above concentrations of 5mM H2O2
The data measured before 3 hours seem less reliable.
2013-08-04
Purpose: Measure the basal expressions of various promoters using smaller volume but more replicates.
Scale: 1 long term (25ml) samples retrieved at 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours, and 7 short terms (4ml) retrieved at 0 and 4 hours.
Items: E0840, R0065+E0840, pLac+E0840, pNHaA+E0840, J23101+E0840, I13507, R0065+I13507, pLac+I13507, pNHaA+E0840, J23101+I13507 all on pSB1A2 backbone
Testing: OD600 and fluorescence 490/530, 485/525 and 470/530 (all GFP) in ELISA plate reader
Results: only R0065+E0840 ,J23101+E0840, J23101+I13507, pLac+E0840, pLac+I13507 show efficient function. This is an efficient way for creating biological replicates.
2013-08-08
Purpose: Finding the impact of high temperature (44C) on the various promoters.
Scale: long term, short term
Items: E0840, J23101+E0840,R0065+E0840, pLac+E0840
Testing: OD600, fluorescence 490/530, 485/525 and 470/530  in ELISA plate reader
Results:
The pLac promoter is highly repressed under 44C compared to at 37C, and R0065 has relatively small repression. As a result, we bagan searching for another repressible promotor in place of pLac.
We finally settled on using the wavelength 485/525 for measuring GFP fluorescence.
2013-08-14
Scale: long term (25ml) for 8 hours
Items: E0840, J23101+E0840, pLac+E0840,HemHp+E0840 with 6 different H2O2 concentrations (0mM, 0.01mM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.5mM, 1mM) on pSB1A2 backbone
Testing: OD600 and fluorescence 485/525 in ELISA plate reader
2013-08-20
Purpose: Measuring  TrxCp+E0840 with respect to different H2O2 concentrations
Scale: 8 short terms (2ml), sample retrieved at 4 hours
Items: E0840, J23101+E0840, R0065+E0840, TrxC+E0840 with 7 different H2O2 concentration (0mM, 0.01mM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 5mM) on pSB1A2 backbone
Testing: OD600 and fluorescence 485/525 in ELISA plate reader
We started washing with PBS instead of M9 medium.
Result: the strength of TrxC promotor enhance as H2O2 concentration rises until it reach 1 mM, and the E. coli K-12 MG1655 dies at 5 mM.
2013-08-25
Purpose: Finding the photometric and fluorometric value of the medium as background
Item: M9 medium and PBS medium
2013-08-26
Purpose: Measuring  Hemhp+E0840 with respect to different H2O2 concentrations
Scale: 10 short terms (2 ml), sample retrieve at 4 hours
Items: J23101+E0840, R0051+ E0840, TrxCp+E0840, Hemhp+E0840 with 7 different H2O2 concentrations (0mM, 0.01mM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 5mM) on pSB1C3 backbone
2013-08-27
Purpose:  Measuring  sufAp(K554003)+E0840 with respect to different H2O2 concentrations
Scale: 10 short terms (2 ml), sample retrieve at 4 hours
Items: J23101+E0840, R0040+E0840, R0074+E0840, sufAp+E0840with 7 different H2O2 concentrations (0mM, 0.01mM, 0.05mM, 0.1mM, 0.5mM, 1mM, 5mM) on pSB1A2 backbone
2013-08-30
Items: E0840, J23101+E0840, J23102+E0840, R0082+E0840
Scale: 10 short terms (2 ml), sample retrieve at 4 hours
Results: When J23101 is standardized as 1, the strength of J23102 is 1.12, and R0082 is 1.25. Since R0082 is positively regulated, R0082 is too leaky so we chose not to use it anymore.
2013-08-31
Purpose: Measuring the strength of different constitutive promotors
Scale: 10 short terms. Replicates retrieved backwards from samples 10 till 1, thus the first time point only grew for 2hrs. That is to say, samples are retrieved every 30 minutesfrom from 2 to 6.5 hours, .
Items: E0840, J23101+E0840, J23104+E0840, J23119+E0840, K592006+ E0840
Results:
40 replicates of J23101 receive a R2 value 0.9757 .
J23119+E0840, J23104+E0840, and K592006+E0840 are almost the same as background, thus we are doubting that it is incorrect. Moreover, we select J23102 as the constitutive promoter in the circuit.
2013-09-05
Purpose: Measuring NTU_Taida's parts.[ Human Practice Collaboration ]
2013-09-07

2013-09-25
Purpose: To simplify our reporting assay protocols, we change our medium into M9 minimal medium, the E. coli K-12 MG1655 is cultivaed directly in 96-well plates.
Scale: 10 short terms (2ml) from 3 to 7.5 hours, samples retrieved every 30 minutes.
Items: AhpCp1+E0840, AhpCp2+E0840, sufAp+E0840, R0065+E0840,J23101+E0840, TrxC+E0840. The last two promotors aree treated with 8 different H2O2 concentrations on pSB1C3 backbone.
Results:The M9 minimal medium has the possibility to interferes with the H2O2, so we restore to our original protocols.
