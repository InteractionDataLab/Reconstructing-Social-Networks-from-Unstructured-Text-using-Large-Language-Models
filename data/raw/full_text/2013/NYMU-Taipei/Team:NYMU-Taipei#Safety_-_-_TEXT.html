The chassis organisms we used for this project
Species
Strain no/name
Risk Group
Disease risk to humans? If so, which disease
1
E. coli K 12
DH5 alpha
1
Yes. May cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys. However, E. coli K-12 is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it toxicogenic. Any concerns for E. coli K-12 in terms of health considerations are mitigated by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.

Do the biological materials used in our lab work pose any of the following risks?
Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe to the workers in the lab. Every species we worked with belongs to BL1.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
Every species we worked with belongs to BL1. They do no harm to human.
Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
Every species we worked with belongs to BL1. They do no harm to the environment. In addition, we have designed a lysis system to ensure our genetic modified E. coli will not survive in the natural environment.
Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
All the biological materials used in our lab are safe, and all the products of the coding sequences are innocuous to human, so the risk of malicious misuse is low.
If our project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise?
If our design works and is introduced into a commercial/industrial product, it means the bees will be immune to certain pathogens. This might exert pressure on the survival of these pathogens. Also, pathogen-resistant bees would threaten the survival of natural bees.
Does our project include any design features to address safety risks?
Light-inducible lysis system is created to ensure our Bee. coil only lives inside of the bee. In addition, we have decided upon encapsulation as being the method to send our Bee. coli into the bee. Since the capsule will only dissolve in a bee’s gut, our Bee. coli will not wantonly spread.
What safety training have we received?
We received safety training by our instructors according to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of our country. Our institution’s safety training requirements
Under what biosafety provisions we work?
Please provide a link to our institution biosafety guidelines.
http://ces-e.web.ym.edu.tw/front/bin/home.phtml & http://ces.web.ym.edu.tw/front/bin/home.phtml
Does our institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group?
Yes, there is an institution in our school called NYMU Center of Environmental Protection and Safety and Health. We had discussed with them and modified the design of the bacteria biosafety lysis system.
Does our country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?
Yes, our country has national biosafety regulations and guidelines .
According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of our lab?
The BioSafety Level rating of our lab is category 1.
What is the Risk Group of our chassis organisms?
The Risk Group of our chassis organisms, E. coli (K12) strain DH5α and strain MG1655, is the Risk Group 1. They match with our lab's BSL rating.
