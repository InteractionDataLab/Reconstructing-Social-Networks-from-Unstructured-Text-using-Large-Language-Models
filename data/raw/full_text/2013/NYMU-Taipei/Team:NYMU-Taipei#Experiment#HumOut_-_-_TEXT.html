Outreaches in schools, communities...etc
‧NYMU promotion:
On May, 15, 2013, we had a presentation in front of all of the schoolmen and faculty to preach the iGEM ideas. After the new semester began, we also went to several departments to share our experienece with the newcomers.
‧Taipei American School Outreach:
On August, 27, 2013, We went to Taipei American School in Tienmu to give out our leaflets, inviting the high school students to join us. We thought that though high school students may not that learned as guaduate students, it’s a good chance to inspire them by doing iGEM. It came out that they founded a team for high school students and followed the protocols we had designed for them.
‧Participation in the biomedical conference:
We knew that it was not enough if we confined ourselves by sharing the ideas only for students, so we headed for the biomedical conference to make people noticed our project. We visited almost every companies in the conference, portraying our dreams about synthetic biology and asking for their suggestion. Luckily, lots of knowledgeable biomedical mechenists were fascinated by our ideas and promised giving us aid if we are in need.
‧Interaction with other iGEM teams:
After doing lots of experiments, we came in a plateau and everythings seemed to be in a pause...we then decided to attend the conference held by NCTU( August, 4-7,2013) to exchange our thoughts and gain different viewpoints from other iGEM teams. We found out the bugs when we were giving out our presentation and made up for them afterwards. We will also participate in the warm-up competition hold by NTU on 29, September, 2013.
‧International Debate Conference:
For there are also CCD problems around the world, we attended the international debate conference to spread the concepts of CCD and also raised peoples’ awareness through out this issue.
