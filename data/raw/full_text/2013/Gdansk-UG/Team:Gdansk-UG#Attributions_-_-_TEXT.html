Attributions
We divided the work in lab between us, so  everybody could get some experience while working on our project.
Wiki
Our Wiki was created by our computer  sciences student, Paweł. The content was mostly written by Anna with grammar  and spelling checking done by Paweł.
Theoretical  part
Most work on theoretical part was done by  Kasia. She’s the one that sacrificed herself and was buried under tones of  scientific articles.
Wetlab
Everyone worked at lab but the one who  spent the largest amount of time there is Tomek – without him we would never  make it. Also, special thanks to Anna, our PCR master and Zofia, who knows the  lab as nobody else.
Fundraising
Most of fundraising job was done by Anna & Anna, our special PR duet.
Human  practice
Everyone worked hard on publishing articles  in web and giving interviews. This time the main PR role was held by Anna and  Paweł.
