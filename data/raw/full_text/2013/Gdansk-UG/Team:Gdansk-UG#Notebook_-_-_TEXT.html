Protocols.
 
Chemical  transformation.
Perform the  same procedure for control test.
Remove tube of frozen  competent cells from -70 C and place on ice.
Remove 100ul per  transformation into a sterile pre-chilled Eppendorf tube.
Add 25ng of DNA (2-10ul)  to the tube. Flick the tube several times.
Leave the tube on ice  for at least 10 minutes. 
Heat shock the cells for  45s at 42 C.
Place tubes on ice for 2 minutes. 
Add 900ul of preheated  to 37°C LB medium and incubate for 1 hour  at 37 C with shaking at 225 rpm.
 Plate 100ul of the cells onto antibiotic  plates.
 Place plates in the 37°C incubator and grow overnight.
Preparation of  competent cells.
1. Prepare 25ml  of sterile 50mM CaCl2 and cool it in a refrigerator.
 2. Innoculate one 1ml of LB medium with  appropriate strain of E.coli.
3. Culture it  overnight in 37°C.
4. Innoculate 40  ml of medium with overnight culture and culture it in 37°C.
 5. When OD600 = 0,2 – 0,25 cool the culture on  ice for 15 minutes.
6. Centrifuge (5  000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C).
7. Suspend the  pellet in 20ml of cold CaCl2.
8. Incubate on  ice for 20 minutes.
9. Centrifuge (5  000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) .
10. Suspend the  pellet in 1ml of cold CaCl2.
11. Incubate for  30-40 minutes on ice.
 
Plasmid DNA isolation – according to a protocol  delivered with a kit (GenElute™ Plasmid  Miniprep Kit).
Genomic DNA isolation – according to a protocol  delivered with a kit (Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit).
Purification of DNA  from agarose gel and PCR mixture – according to a protocol delivered with a kit  (Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System).
 
Agarose  electrophoresis – 2% gel.
1. Dissolve 1,2 agarose in 60 ml of 0,5xTBE buffer.  Heat the mixture up.
 2. When  cooled to about 60°C, pour the mixture into the gel mold. Wait for it to cool  down.
3. Mix the DNA sample with GelRed dye and loading  buffer. Load the sample and DNA ladder.
4. Run the electrophoresis in 0,5xTBA, for 30 min,  under 60V.
