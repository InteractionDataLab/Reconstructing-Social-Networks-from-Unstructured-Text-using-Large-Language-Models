Our project plan
 
We are aiming to construct a bacterium which  would be able detect methanol in ethanol solutions.
The reason for choosing this subject is the  constant problem of people consuming alcohol which has methanol levels  exceeding permissible limits. As we all know, methanol it a very toxic  compound. Its consumption may lead to damaging nervous system and even death.  Therefore, a test that would enable people to check ethanol alcohol purity  would prevent a whole lot of cases of people hospitalized because of methanol  intoxication.
The aim of our project is to have not only  a reliable test, but also easy to perform, without usage of specialized lab  equipment. The idea is that a normal, average person could check with our test  the level of dangerous compound at home.
 
 Step I.
Firstly, we wanted to design a BioBrick  consisting of our methanol – dependent promoter. It is the core of our project,  so we decided to mainly focus on it.  In  theory the plan that we prepared was clear and easy – but, of course, nothing  is predictable in lab J The part itself fortunately didn’t include any restriction sites  that we would have to get rid of, so the only thing that we had to do was  isolating genomic DNA from M.organophilum,  PCR with primers matching our promoter sequence and ligation of the PCR product  with plasmid Backbone. 
Step II.
The second step that we planned to do was  to check if our BioBrick is properly working. The bacterium on which we wanted  to test it was E.coli TOP10 F’ strain. We decided that the reporter protein which we will use is GFP and  catechol oxidase.
Step III.
After checking, if the BioBrick which we  constructed is working, we wanted to ligate our part with pKT230 plasmid. The  aim of this procedure was to create a plasmid that would be maintained by Zymomonas mobilis. After a thorough  research we decided, that Zymomonas  mobilis, although it’s hard to transform, would be a best host to our  plasmid due to its high resistance to ethanol. 
Step IV.
The last step was to measure the efficiency  of reporter protein production by Zymomonas  mobilis in different concentrations of methanol.
 
Results.
Unfortunately, due to lack of time, we  couldn’t execute our whole project plan. What we achieved, was creation of the  methanol-dependent promoter BioBrick. We didn’t have time to measure how well  it’s working. We also constructed pKT230 plasmid with an insert consisting of  methanol-dependent promoter and GFP. We hope to continue or work after the  Jamboree. Next step ahead of us: Z.mobilis transformation!
