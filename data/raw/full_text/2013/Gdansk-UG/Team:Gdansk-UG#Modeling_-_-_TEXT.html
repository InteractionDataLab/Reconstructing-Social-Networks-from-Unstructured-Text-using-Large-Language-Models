Human Practice
 
We decided to propagate the idea of  synthetic biology in a way that would reach everyone – by internet.
First it  was a local project, involving some webpages of our city. After a while, and  thanks to persistency of everyone, we managed to have some longer articles  published on popular news webs – our dream was slowly starting to happen, we  could reach even more people!
But the highest peak of surfers' interest in  synthetic biology and our project was after publishing our movie with short  description on the most popular entertainment page in Poland. Thanks to it we  were able to show the idea of synthetic biology and our project to more than  32 000 people! We have never dreamed than we could achieve this number but  we hope that our movie was a good way to inform people about synthetic biology  and its capabilities.
Here are links to some of the webpages that  interviewed us (every article is unfortunately only in Polish language  version):
