Welcome to our Site
 
We are a group of students from Poland, Gdańsk and we present you our project: Metoli!
 
 
We aim to construct bacteria able to detect  methanol in ethanol solutions. Our project focuses on using a methanol-dependent  promoter and a gene regulated by it – methanol dehydrogenase. We would like to  introduce bacteria, which –in presence of methanol – would produce a dye, for  instance, GFP.
The main problem is to find a promoter that  is insensible to ethanol. Unfortunately, the most suitable organism – Picha pastoris – has methanol-dependent  promoters which are blocked in the presence of ethanol. Therefore, we have  found a bacterium which is an obligate methylotroph – Methylobacterium organophilum. In theory, its methanol-dependent promoter should react only to methanol.
We would like to present two different  approaches to our project. Depending on initial results, we will take different  measures to reaching our goal. Being restricted by the possibility that the  promoter may not act as we would like it to, we thought of another route.
The first method, based on  methanol-dependent promoter is very clear and easy to achieve. Provided that  this promoter is insensible to ethanol and that it works well in our final,  transformed organism, we only have to measure the efficiency of dye production  in different concentrations of alcohols.
The other approach focuses on the reaction  catalyzed by methanol dehydrogenase. This enzyme, in the presence of NAD+,  is able to alter methanol into formaldehyde. While detecting the methanol with simple  measures is very hard, performing a colorimetric reaction with formaldehyde seems  to be quite possible.
The bacterium, which we want to use as a host is E. coli and if it works, we will try to perform the transformation on Zymomonas mobilis, which ethanol resistance is much hiigher. Z. mobilis transformation is much harder, so firstly we will focus on more known organism, E.coli .
