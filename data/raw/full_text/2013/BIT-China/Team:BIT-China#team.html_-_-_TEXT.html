Yueqin Liu
It is my pleasure to become a member of the iGEM competition and also glad to share with the dribs and drabs of the experiment and life.
Haiyang Jia
Chemical Engineering and Technology
responsible for the design of the whole gene gene circuit, developing experiment program, the assembly of the Quorum-sensing device and independent variable frequency oscillator, and some management works
XiangYing Sun
My name is Xiangying  Sun, I am a graduate student. This is my first time to participate in iGEM as an advisor. In our project, I am mainly responsible for hierarchy heat-resistant device.
Students Members
Wenhong Zu
Biotechnology
I’m crazy about synthetic biology for its concepts and application. In this iGEM project, I’m responsible for the stochastic dynamics analysis of engineered gene circuit by mathematical modelling and numerical simulation.
Huan Sun
Biology
responsible for the assembly of the PCD device and thermotolerance(HSPs) device ,writing weekly journal of iGEM conferance and presentation.
Baiyang Liu
Biotechnology
iGEM is my first lab experience and it is a great chance for me to design something amazing. I have taken part in the experiment, project and poster design,enjoying working with other teammates.
Lichao Zhu
hi, i'm Richard, this year I accomplished the heat-resisting device with xiangying sun and yun wang. to me, joining IGEM is a great process of experiencing and learning many things. it helps me understand the synthetic biology more clearly.
Yunqian Wang
It is a really pleasure to take part in iGEM. I feel that I am very lucky to work with my friends, from which I get a lot of knowledge and happiness. I like make friends with all kinds of people, for talking with a new friend will give you both new information and new happiness.
Shanqin Liang
Bioengineering
The more challenge,the more passion. As a senior student ,I’m not the most important but necessary  in our team. My mainly work is experiment for RNA thermometer .Making poster is another work on which I need to focus .
Yue Wang
Bioengineer
I am an undergraduate from biological engineering, and I love watching movies and traveling. I'm involved in heat-resistant device and collecting relevant information for human practice .
Xiaoli Gu
Biological Engineering
Xiaoli GU is a junior in Beijing Institute of Technology majoring in bioengineering. She makes a lot of in assembling the team .As a member of this team ,She is charge of poster and RNA thermometer.Playing Table tennis is her favorite sport.
Yinan Luan
Industrial Design
I am the artistic director in the Wiki group. I am responsible for the group's LOGO design, Wiki's graphic design and poster's beautification.
Nisi Jiang
Participating in this challenging competition offers me a chance to do these creative works.  I'm responsible for designing the gene network,di and the improvement of existing devices.  "Where there is a will there is a way."
Bangjie Liao
Vehicle Engineering
I am a programmer in the Wiki group, and I am responsible for the coding of our Wiki website, whilst I also provide necessary technical supports to the other groups.
Jiexin Zhang
Information Engineering
IGEM is a platform to accumulate relevant research experience. I’m the responser of the wiki group and in charge of the design, construction and maintenance of our team wiki.
Tianhui Zhang
Industry Engineering
It's my great please to join this team.I am responsible for the mathematical modelling.
Han Yue
I am a student of BIT. iGEM teach me a lot about synthetic biology and it make me feel curious about life. I am responsible for human practice and help other members.
About the University
Beijing Institute of Technology is one of the national key universities in China, an open, public, research-oriented university with a focus on science and technology. The 10th university to enter the 985 Project, which started in order to develop 39 Chinese universities that would seek to become world renowned universities.One of the first 15 universities to join 211 Project which established roughly 100 universities to cope with the challenges of the 21st century. Annual research fund in 2011 amounts to 160 million Euros ranking in the top 10 in China.
Received more than 130 national awards of science and technology over the past 30 years, ranking among the top 10 in China. According to the first national program evaluation from 2002 to 2004 by MOE, 1/3 of the programs in BIT were evaluated as national key programs.
BIT is one of the 1st universities to run a graduate school and one of the key universities supported by the central government in each Five-Year Plan since the foundation of the P. R. China. BIT receives considerable trilateral supports and endowments under the agreement signed by the Ministry of Education, the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, and the Beijing Municipal Government in September 2000.
BIT is now under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
