2/28/13 2-28
On this day, our team was formally established. BIT-China for one green earth is our slogan .And what we want to do is to improve the optimistic temperature from 37℃ to 42℃ in fermentation of E.coli ,then we can contribute to increase the competitive of  fermentative products with many aspects, including reducing the consumption of energy of source, simplifying productive process and improving the efficiency.
3/2/13 3-2
We design two systems to reach our goal. The first system is the customize thermotolerance system. We choose heat shock protein family (HSP) with the control of RNA thermometer. Another system is intelligent quorum regulating system, we use quorum sensing device and programmed cell death(PCD) device to control the cell density ,aiming at maintaining cell in an optimistic cell density to control the release of heat.
3/9/13 3-9
We optimized our design, and choose the red fluorescent protein as the goal products.
4/2/13 4-2
According to our goal, we designed some new genes chosen some known genes. Following figure is a brief gene line.
4/10/13 4-10
Combining the references and experimental verification, we finish the design of whole pathway. The following figure shows the detail information.

HSP:
We amplified these genes respectively by PCR, including GroeS、GroeL、DnaK, DnaJ, ThiF, TTE, IbpA, FliA, RpoE3 and RpoE7. Then we connected these genes with Gapa promoter in plasmid PET-28a and transformed it into E.coli.
5/7/13 5-7
HSP:
This week, we finished the work of GroeS, GroeL, DnaK and DnaJ. Here are the results by Colony PCR.
5/15/13 5-15
This week, we completed the work of ThiF, TTE, IbpA, FliA, RpoE3 and RpoE7. The results of verification by Colony PCR are shown as follow.
5/24/13 5-24

6/2/13 6-2
HSP:
Fermentation was conformed in 43℃ during this week.
6/9/13 6-9
We verified the function of these genes in 46℃ by fermentation.
6/17/13 6-17
After being compared with each other, we used GroeS, GroeL, DnaK, DnaJ and ThiF to make heat resistance part. We began on the work of verifying the function of these genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We changed the promoter into FBA1 promoter which is a strong one. After transforming the plasmids with targeting genes into Saccharomyces cerevisiae successfully, we got our engineering strains. Currently, we finished the fermentation of TTE strain.
6/24/13 6-24
This week, we worked mainly on the construction of standard heat-resistance part. According to our design, we connected a RNA thermometers named ROSE and FourU with targeting genes. Then we combined these genes with plasmid PET-28a and transformed it into E.coli.

PCD:
We examined OD of normal E.coli and E.coli with exogenous HSP, DnaK. The result showed that HSP expressed in relatively cool condition did have apparent negative affection on the growth of E.coli. But as the time passed, the OD were relatively close. We thought that HSP worked and helped to folded incorrect proteins, then the growth of cell were contributed.
