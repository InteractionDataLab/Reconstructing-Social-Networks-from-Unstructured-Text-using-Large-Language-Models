Jenna Rickus
Dr. Jenna Rickus, originally from Brownsburg, Indiana, is amazingly both an Associate Professor of Agricultural and Biological Engineering and  an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering. Not only did she complete a bachelors in biological engineering, but she received a bachelors in biochemistry from Purdue University as well. After that she followed her dreams out to California to complete a PhD in Neuro Engineering at UCLA before coming back to Purdue to teach and continue research. She loves traveling with her two adorable children and husband as well as attending biotechnology conferences all over the world.
Kari Clase
Dr. Kari Clase is currently a professor at Purdue University teaching in both the school of technology as well as in biological engineering. She originally studied biochemistry at Old Dominion University as an undergraduate. Later she received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from Purdue. She grew up in Wisconsin and enjoys reading, spending time with her family, and hiking. Bet you didn’t know that she use to live above the Arctic Circle!
Soo Ha
Soo Jung Ha is a graduate student and pursuing her Masters degree in Biotechnology & Bioinformatics in College of Technology, Purdue University. It is her second year mentoring iGEM team at Purdue. She loves running, baking, and watching movies. Interesting fact about Soo is she has a Doberman puppy and he is almost same size as her.
Janie Brennan
Janie is currently a fourth year PhD student at Purdue, working in protein engineering.  Originally from Indianapolis, she also received her bachelor’s from Purdue University in Biological and Food Process Engineering.  In her spare time, she likes to read lots of books on her Kindle, play various musical instruments (piano, trombone, euphonium), and watch nerdy TV shows like Doctor Who and Star Trek: TNG.  Random fact: Janie is also a professional puppeteer, specializing in marionettes.
Jen Kahn
Jen is a PhD student currently working under the direction of Dr. Rickus in the area of silica-based biomaterials.  Originally from New Mexico, she received her bachelor's degree in Biosystems Engineering from the University of Arizona in 2008 and her MSE from Purdue University in 2012.  Outside of work, Jen enjoys spending time with family and friends, knitting, and home improvement projects.
