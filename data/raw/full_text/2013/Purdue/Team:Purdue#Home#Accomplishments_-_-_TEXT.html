Not Trying to Brag or Anything, But...
Accomplishments
Adapted a statistical analysis method to fit synthetic biology and wrote a protocol so that it can be utilized in other teams' projects
Updated Drew Endy's bicistronic design constructs to be compatible with the iGEM registry standards
Collaborated with over 75 iGEM teams to design a standardized datasheet for easier data representation and part characterization
Officially submitted a new promoter to the registry and showed proof of function, with plans to submit the remaining four parts at a later date after further characterization
Performed outreach to local farmers and producers in the West Lafayette area to gauge their thoughts and knowledge towards synthetic biology
Worked with representatives of the Girls Scouts of America to design and implement a biotechnology badge and introduction curriculum
Continued work from the 2012 competition to create a community lab space in Noblesville, Indiana for public use and education
Medal Requirements
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
✓
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
✓
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2013 Judging form.
✓
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✓
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✓
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of, and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function), of a previously existing BioBrick part in the 'Experience' page of that part's Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Registry.
Part Number:BBa_K1225000
✓
Description of function
✓
Quantitative data showing the Part or Device function
✓
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
✓
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
✓
Document the characterization of this part in the 'Main Page' of that Part's/Device's Registry entry Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Part Number(s): BBa_K1225000
✓
Description of function
✓
Quantitative data showing the Part or Device Function
✓
Acknowedgment of sources and references
✓
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project. Safety
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
✓
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. Characterization Standard
✓
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation. Human Practices Overview
