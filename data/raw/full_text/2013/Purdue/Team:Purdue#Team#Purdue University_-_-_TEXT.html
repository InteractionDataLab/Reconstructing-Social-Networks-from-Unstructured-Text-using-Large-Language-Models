The Base of Operations
Purdue University is a public, comprehensive institution. Founded in 1869 by a land-grant from Lafayette businessman John Purdue. It does not feel big to its students, even though it is one of America's largest universities. Indeed, the main campus in West Lafayette, Indiana, was built around a master plan that keeps walking time between classes to a maximum of 12 minutes. Its 1,579-acre campus is located in West Lafayette, 65 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference, and is a well known world-class research institution. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.
