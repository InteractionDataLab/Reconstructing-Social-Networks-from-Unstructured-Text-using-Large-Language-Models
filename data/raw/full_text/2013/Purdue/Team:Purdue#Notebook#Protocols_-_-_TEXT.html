Transformation Protocol
Goal:
To transform parts from the registry into competent cells Materials:
Parts from Kit Plates
Plates with Antibiotic Resistance (Must be warmed up in 37°C room)
2 plates per part (specific antibiotic type depends on part resistance)
1 plate for negative control (for each type of antibiotic used)
1 Ampicillin plate (for RFP control)
1 LB Plate (for positive control)
10 pg/μL RFP control
Eppendorf Tubes
2 tubes for controls
1 tube per part
PCR Tubes
1 tube per part
BL21 Competent Cells
50μL for controls
25μL per part
SOC Media
400μL for controls
200μL per part
Ice
42°C Water Bath
Glass Beads
37°C Incubator
Pipettes and Tips (Filtered Tips if possible)
Deionized Water Procedure:
Prepare lab space
Wipe counter with ethanol
Light flame
Resuspend parts from the kit plates and transfer them to labeled PCR tubes
Mark part location on kit plate with a Sharpie marker
Use pipette tip to puncture kit plate and move around to clear all foil from opening
Add 10μL of DI Water to Kit Plate well and pipette up and down until orange liquid is present in pipette tip  (The DNA is freeze-dried and needs to be resuspended in water)
Put the 10μL of DNA suspension into a labeled PCR tube
Repeat for each necessary part
Warm up Water Bath to 42°C
If water bath is too warm, remove some water and add cold water
Thaw competent cells and RFP DNA on ice
Fill ice bucket with ice from the autoclave room
Bring the ice bucket to the -80°C freezer and immediately put competent cells in ice when removing from freezer
Retrieve RFP DNA from -20°C freezer and immediately put in ice
Add 25μL of competent cells to each of the eppendorf tubes.  Label each.
Keep cells in ice as much as possible
Mark top of cell container with Sharpie (to mark that they have been used)
Return cells to -80°C freezer as soon as possible
Label each eppendorf tube with the part name, RFP Control, or Control
Add 4μL of DNA to respective eppendorf tube (except the RFP control and Control tubes)
iMake sure that the DNA and cells are mixed well
Store leftover DNA (in PCR tube) in -20°C Freezer
Add 1μL of the RFP DNA to the RFP control tube (The RFP control is used as a standard for transformation efficiency measurements)
Incubate tubes on ice for 45 minutes
Heat shock cells at 42°C for 60 seconds (to open the cell walls so that the DNA can enter the cell)
Insert eppendorf tubes into Styrofoam holders (so they float in the water bath)
Tubes must remain in ice until insertion into water bath then swiftly move tubes to water bath
Time very precisely and then immediately place tubes back into ice after 60 seconds
After about a minute, move tubes around in ice because the nearby ice has probably melted
Put cells back on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200μL of SOC media to each tube
Incubate cells for 2 hours at 37°C and at 250 rpm (to aerate cells and evenly distribute cells within nutrients)
Plate cells
Plating the Cells
Scatter the appropriate amount of the cell suspension in drops on the plate
Pour about 5 glass bead onto the plate
Swirl plate to move glass beats around and evenly coat media with liquid suspension of cells
Ensure that plates are properly labeled
All parts should be plated at 20μL and 100μL on antibiotic plates (Be sure to use correct antibiotic plate depending on part resistance)
The RFP Control should be plated on an Ampicillin plate at 100μL
Plate 100μL of the cells on antibiotic plate(s) (Negative control)
Plate 100μL of cells on LB plate (Positive control)
Incubate overnight from 12-18 hours (at 37°C) Expected Data:
Cell growth observed on the Positive Control
Ensures that cells are growing properly
No Cell growth observed on the Negative Control
Ensures that the antibiotic is functioning
Observed growth and fluorescence on the RFP control plate
Cell growth on the plates with the parts
Less growth should be observed on the 20μL plates because fewer cells were placed on the plates to grow originally Recorded Data:
Plate growth images
Images of RFP fluorescence
Conclusions:
If growth was observed on the plates with the transformed parts, no growth on the negative control, and growth on the positive control, then the transformation was successful.  Next, the transformed parts must be mini-prepped.
Miniprep Protocol
Goal:
To isolate and extract genomic DNA from transformed colonies
Materials:
Qiagen Miniprep Kit
Buffer P1 is kept in the 4°C
Centrifuge
Micropipette and Tips
Eppendorf Tubes
Qiagen Spin Columns
Cells in liquid media Procedure:
(This only needs to be done once)  - Add LyseBlue to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1:1000)
Warm up EB Buffer in water bath to 50°C
Place EB Buffer in Styrofoam holder to float in water bath
Pellet 1-5 mL of bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at >8000 rpm for 3 minutes at room temperature
Add 1mL of each liquid cell culture to each eppendorf tube
Place eppendorf tubes in centrifuge (balanced)
Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 10,000 rpm
Pour out liquid into sink (Pellet should still remain at bottom)
Continue process, add liquid cell culture to eppendorf tube with pellet until all of the cells have been pelleted
Resuspend pelleted cells in 250μL Buffer P1 and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube (Buffer P1 lyses the cells)
Can vortex or tap tube on counter to Resuspend the cells (must not be stuck to bottom)
Put Buffer P1 back into the 4°C fridge
Add 250μL Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube for 3 minutes  (Buffer P2 also lyses the cells)
PROMPTLY add 350μL Buffer NE3 and mix immediately by inverting the tube for 1 minute (This neutralizes the lyse buffers.  It is important to do this promptly so that they do not damage the DNA)
"Should look like a desiccated coconut and not gloopy”
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm (The cells will collect at the bottom of the eppendorf tube and the supernatant (liquid in the tube) contains the DNA)
Apply supernatant from step 7 to the Qiagen Spin Column.  Centrifuge for 60 seconds and discard flow-through (Separates DNA from liquid in the supernatant)
Add 750μL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 60 sec and discard flow-through (Buffer PE prevents DNA from dissociating from the column while washing away other contaminants)
Repeat the previous step
Centrifuge for 1 minute to remove residual wash buffer
Transfer to a new microcentrifuge tube
Add 25μL Buffer EB, let stand 1 minute, centrifuge 1 minute (Buffer EB solubilizes the DNA so that it can flow through the spin column)
Repeat the previous step
Measure DNA concentrations with the Nanodrop (bring a blank of the EB Buffer)
When finished, store DNA in the -20°C freezer Expected Data:
DNA concentration readings of 100 – 300 ng/μL are great
DNA concentration readings of 50 – 100 ng/μL are okay Recorded Data:
Measure DNA Concentrations using the Nanodrop
Located upstairs
Must be trained on the Nanodrop
Conclusions:
DNA from the transformations has now been extracted!  Future work includes digestion and ligation
LB Agar
We used a premade Becton, Dickinson and Comapany mix to make our LB Agar
Adding Antiobiotics to LB
How to make LB liquid plus antibiotics:
Ampicillin – The frozen stock solutions of ampicillin are at 50mg/ml and 100mg/ml in H2O, and are marked with a red sticker. The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 50ul/ml. To obtain this in 100ml (the amount in each LB bottle), add 100ul stock solution.
Kanamycin – The frozen stock solutions of kanamycin are at 50mg/ml in H2O, and are marked with green. The final concentration for LB liquid culture for growing plasmids is 50ug/ml, and for cosmids is 20ug/ml. To obtain 50ng/ml in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution, and to obtain 20ug/ml, add 40ul stock solution.
Tetracycline – The frozen stock solutions of tetracycline are at 15mg/ml in methanol and are marked with black. The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 15ug/ml. To obtain this in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution.
Chloramphenicol – The frozen stock solutions of chloramphenicol are at 25mg/ml in 100% ethanol and are marked with purple. The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 25mg/ml. To obtain this in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution.
How to make LB plates plus antibiotics:
Follow the recipe card in box for making LB plates, being sure to add the agar. After autoclaving, and when the agar has cooled enough that it’s not too hot to touch (about 1 to 1.5hrs), add antibiotics as follows:
Ampicillin – add 1ml ampicillin (at 100mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 100ug/ml. Mark the plate with a single red line on the side.
Kanamycin – add 1ml kanamycin stock (at 50mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 50ug/ml. Mark the plates with a single green line on the side.
Tetracycline – add 1ml tetracycline stock (at 15mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 15ug/ml. Mark the plates with a single black line on the side.
Chloramphenicol – add 1ml chloramphenicol stock (at 25mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 100ug/ml. Mark the plates with a single purple line on the side.
