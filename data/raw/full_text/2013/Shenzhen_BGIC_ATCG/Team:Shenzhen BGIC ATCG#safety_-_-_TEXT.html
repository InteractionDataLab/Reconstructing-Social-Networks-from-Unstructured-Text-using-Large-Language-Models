http://or.ucsf.edu/ehs/7240-DSY/10232
Yes, it may cause diarrhea through contaminated food.
*For additional organisms, please include a spreadsheet in your submission.
2. Highest Risk Group Listed:
1
*If you answered 1+, please also complete the iGEM Biosafety form part 2 for any organisms in this category.
3. List and describe all new or modified coding regions you will be using in your project. (If you use parts from the 2013 iGEM Distribution without modifying them, you do not need to list those parts.)
Part number.
Where did you get the physical DNA for this part (which lab, synthesis company, etc)
What species does this part originally come from?
What is the Risk  Group  of the species?
What is the function  of this  part,  in  its  parent species?

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe. a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
E.coli K12 MG1655 DH5α & S.cerevisiae BY4741 and the biomaterials listed above and in the additional file: harmless to the man in the lab.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
E.coli K12 MG1655 DH5α & S.cerevisiae BY4741: they may pollute the food, accelerating the food spoilage, leading to diarrhea.
The biomaterials listed above and in the additional file: harmless to public.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
E.coli K12 MG1655 DH5α & S.cerevisiae BY4741 and the biomaterials listed above and in the additional file: harmless to the environment.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
E.coli K12 MG1655 DH5α & S.cerevisiae BY4741 and the biomaterials listed above and in the additional file: no such risks.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial  product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
No more risks. This project utilize cell cycle system of yeast to produce various flurorescent protein to target them to different place in different time. The aim is to make a dynamics color swapping like a movie. Besides, we use some key point gene in cell cycle to regulate the running of cell cycle of yeast.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
Yes, we adopt auxotrophic strategy. BY4741 has 5 auxotrophic feature: LEU, URA, MET, HIS, LYS.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?  Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
All of our team member have received safety training provided by Biosafety Committee from BGI
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.
No such a link about the guideline.
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
Yes. Yes, we have ever talked with them about the project. No risk problem were raised.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
Yes. http://english.biosafety.gov.cn/sg/index.htm
d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? (Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description  that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features [see 2013.igem.org/Safety  for help].
BSL3
e. What is the Risk Group of your chassis organism(s), as you stated in question 1? If it does not match the BSL rating of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are taking.
