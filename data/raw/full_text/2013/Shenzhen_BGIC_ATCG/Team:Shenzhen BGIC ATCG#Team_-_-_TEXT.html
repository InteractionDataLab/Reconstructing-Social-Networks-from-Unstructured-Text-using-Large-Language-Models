Who we are
Shenzhen_BGIC_ATCG is a special consortium named after a city. Team members are not from one school, but eight. In their 3rd or 4th year in university, some undergraduate students came to Shenzhen and involved in a joint program called Innovation Program in BGI College. After lectures introducing synthetic biology and iGEM given by our instructor K2, 29 students from ten schools, including HUST, SCU, SCUT, UESTC, WHU, SCNU, SEU and SUG,MAH,JNU, have decided to set up a united team for iGEM 2013. Students from eight different universities have contributed to this project including:  - Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China  - Sichuan University, China  - South China University of Technology, China  - Wuhan University, China  - University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China  - Southeast University, China  - South China Normal University, China  - Medical university of Anhui   - China University of Geosciences   - Jinan University
