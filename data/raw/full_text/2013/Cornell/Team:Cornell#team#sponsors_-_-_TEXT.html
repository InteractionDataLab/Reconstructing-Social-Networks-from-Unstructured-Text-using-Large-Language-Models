New England Biolabs
Founded in the mid-1970s as a collective of scientists committed to developing innovative products for the life sciences industry, New England Biolabs is now a recognized world leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant and native enzymes for genomic research. The team is grateful for NEB  sponsorship of the iGEM competition, which has provided teams with the BioBrick® Assembly Kit and other products such as DNA ladders and enzymes.
Corning Incorporated
Corning Incorporated is the world leader in specialty glass and ceramics. Drawing on more than 160 years of materials science and process engineering knowledge, Corning creates and makes keystone components that enable high-technology systems for consumer electronics, mobile emissions control, telecommunications and life sciences. Corning graciously supported our team through donations of laboratory supplies and has been a strong supporter of Cornell iGEM for the past four years.
Geneious
Geneious is a DNA, RNA and protein sequence alignment, assembly and analysis software platform, integrating bioinformatic and molecular biology tools into a simple interface. We thank Geneious for their donated software which helped us design primers and plan our cloning.
SnapGene
SnapGene offers molecular biology software that offers a fast and easy way to plan, visualize, and document molecular biology procedures. The team would like to thank Snapgene for providing us with licenses that we have used to help visualize our genetic constructs.
VWR
VWR provides an expansive choice of premiere products, such as chemicals, furniture, equipment, instruments, apparel and consumables, to the world's top pharmaceutical, biotech, industrial, educational, governmental, and healthcare organizations. VWR has generously supported Cornell iGEM with necessary research supplies.
Gold Biotechnology
Gold Biotechnology, Inc. was founded in 1986 by Dr. Paul Gold in an effort to provide researchers with high-quality products at low prices. Gold-Bio has graciously sponsored our team by providing quality biotechnology products and chemicals.
Integrated DNA Technologies
Integrated DNA Technologies specializes in DNA synthesis, gene construction, antisense oligos, molecular beacons and a variety of molecular biology products. We thank IDT for being an official sponsor of the iGEM competition and providing teams with a discount on gene fragments.
NeoBioLab
Located in Cambridge, MA, NeoBioLab is a dedicated biology service provider and partner, providing innovative solutions to molecular and cellular biology, in vivo experiments, and drug screening services. We thank NeoBioLabs for supporting our research.
MathWorks
MathWorks is the world's leading developer of technical computing software for engineers and scientists in industry, government, and education. The team thanks MathWorks for sponsoring the 2013 iGEM competition, providing software and technical support to all iGEM teams.
Dan Simpkins of Hillcrest Labs
Hillcrest Labs is the leading global supplier of software and hardware for motion- enabled products. The team would like to thank Dan Simpkins, CEO of Hillcrest Labs, for sharing his entrepreneurial vision and supporting our team for the past few years.
Nanocs Inc.
Nanocs Inc. is a leading biochemical reagent provider in life science research, with products such as PEG derivatives, nanoparticles and beads, and labels and crosslinkers. The team thanks Nanocs for supporting our research.
Growth Curves USA
Bioscreen-C Automated Growth Curve Analysis System provides a tightly controlled environment for measurement of growth of bacteria, molds, yeasts, or spores. The team thanks Growth Curves USA for supporting our project.
Bioss Inc.
Bioss Inc. is dedicated to developing and manufacturing top quality antibodies that accelerate biological research and discovery. They have developed over 10,000 primary antibodies and more than 150,000 derived products including fluorochrome and enzyme conjugated antibodies to facilitate a range of research aims. Bioss is located in the greater Boston area; one of the world’s thriving biotech communities. The team thanks Bioss for supporting our project this year.
Cornell David A. Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future
Created in 2006 by the Office of the Provost, the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) advances multidisciplinary research and cultivates innovative collaborations within and beyond Cornell to foster a sustainable future for all. ACSF has graciously supported our team’s work on biomaterials development.
Cornell University
We would like to thank the Cornell College of Engineering for providing material, monetary, and other resources to the team. The Departments of Biological & Environmental Engineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, and Electrical & Computer Engineering have all provided resources and advice to the team.
Cornell Institute for Biotechnology & Life Sciences Technology
The mission of Cornell’s Biotech Institute is to promote research, education and technology transfer for applications of biotechnology for the benefit of the environment, agriculture, engineering and veterinary and human medicine. We would like to thank the institute for their monetary support to the team for the purchasing of laboratory supplies and equipment.
Weill Institute
The Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, is an interdisciplinary research institute in the heart of Cornell University's Ithaca, NY campus focusing on cell signaling and molecular dynamics. Weill Hall is home to the Cornell iGEM lab, space which was graciously donated to us through Professor Shivaun Archer also in Weill Hall. The Weill Institute also provided the team with monetary support for purchasing laboratory supplies and access to equipment.
Cornell Office of Academic Diversity Initiatives
Ezra Cornell's revolutionary commitment to "any person... in any study" inspires OADI to cultivate the extraordinary presence of so many talented individuals in so many ground-breaking intellectual, artistic, and technical pursuits in order that every person in every study experiences the full diversity of dynamic and stimulating exchange with each other.
The team would also like to thank all of our sponsors on Microryza, our crowdfunding platform - your donations have helped us realize our project goals.
