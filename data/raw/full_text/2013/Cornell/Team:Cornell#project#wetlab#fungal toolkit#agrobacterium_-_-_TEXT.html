Agrobacterium
Background
Wide varieties of plant and fungal cells can be easily and efficiently transformed by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In this process, plant or fungal tissue is co-cultured with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, an organism that is able to transfer part of its DNA to plants and fungi, known as T-DNA. Genetic constructs can be inserted into these T-DNA vectors and then transformed into A. tumefaciens, allowing it to insert this construct into a plant or fungal genome [1].
Methods
In order to transform our genetic constructs into Ganoderma lucidum, we first inserted them into pOSCAR, a T-DNA vector that contains regions that A. tumefaciens can insert into fungal cells. Following transformation of A. tumefaciens with our constructs in the pOSCAR vector, we co-cultured the cells with G. lucidum in induction media that provides optimal conditions for T-DNA insertion for a period of 2 days. G. lucidum was then placed on a selective plate to isolate transformants [2].
