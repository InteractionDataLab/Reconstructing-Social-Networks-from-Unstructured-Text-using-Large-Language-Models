Parallax Design 1
Inspired by this site --->
This version's not quite the same and still has some bugs
http://hotdot.pro/en/#
(Yeah I stole the background)
Use the arrow keys to navigate -->
These pages can replace sliders
And have pretty pictures that link to project pages
This means design will be really important
It also takes a ton of time to set the page up cause I have to position everything manually
Whee!
Yay! Parallax
(Nupur's awesome)
