Future Applications
Our work this year is particularly far reaching because all of our constructs are designed for functional use in basidiomycetes.  Extensive genetic work has not yet been done to take advantage of this diverse phylum’s many unique chemical products and favorable physiologies, and so our comprehensive toolkit opens the door to many future synthetic biology applications for basidiomycetes.  Not only did our fungal toolkit allow us to take steps towards improving Ecovative’s packaging material, but it will also allow future researchers to more easily utilize basidiomycetes for possible biomaterials, bioremediation, and pharmaceutical applications.
