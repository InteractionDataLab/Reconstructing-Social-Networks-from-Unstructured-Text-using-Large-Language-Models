Human Practices Overview
One of the novelties of our project this year is its potential for immediate application. Because of our collaboration with Ecovative, our research can be implemented directly into the existing product and can improve both Ecovative’s biodegradable material and the company’s production process. Our work's utilization in a consumer product requires a focus on a wide range of potential consequences, including the result of its existence in a growing consumer market. We had to ensure that our research would not negatively affect the environmental impact of the foam product or decrease the novelty of the biodegradable substitute. We also looked into safety concerns associated with the release of our genetically modified organism into the environment. To address these concerns, we stayed in constant contact with Ecovative and discussed our project in great detail with communities that have an interest or will be affected by our research.
