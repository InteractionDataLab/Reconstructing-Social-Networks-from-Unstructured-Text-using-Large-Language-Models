Our research at Cornell iGEM would not have been possible without the advice, guidance, and supplies of many of our advisors.
The wetlab portion of our research was conducted in Professor Archer’s lab. Dr. Archer provided us with lab facilities including a gel imaging station, microscopes, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. Finally, she advised us on lab safety techniques.
Most of our fungal engineering was done in the Turgeon Lab. The Turgeon Lab provided us with their lab space including their incubator, sterile hood, autoclave, and centrifuge. They provided us a protocol on how to protoplast  and also mentored and advised us. In addition, they provided us with a
strain of Cochliobolus heterostrophus with which we were able to protoplast and attempt transformations. After successful protoplasting, they showed us the proper procedure for polyethylene glycol transformation including recovery via molten regeneration broth. They provided us with materials including SRB's micronutrients and complete media broth.  Finally, they provided us with high expression vectors for Cochliobolus heterostrophus which we were able to use as a positive control when transforming.
The Luo Lab gave us a sample of a plasmid, pIVEX2.3d, which contained the T7 promoter and terminator, and access to a fluorescent microscope and plate reader.
Dr. David Hibbett from the Clark Lab provided us with a sample of a sequenced strain of Ganoderma lucidum on which we were able to test various transformation methods.
Dr. Xiling Shen advised us throughout the year and gave us feedback on our project timeline and presentation.
Ecovative provided advice and inspiration on our project. They offered to grow our genetically engineered strains and also provided us with modeling data to evaluate the packing material.
Thank You!
