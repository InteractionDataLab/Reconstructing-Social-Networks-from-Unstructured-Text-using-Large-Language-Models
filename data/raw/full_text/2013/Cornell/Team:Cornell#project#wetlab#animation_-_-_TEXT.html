Animation
Our project was less amenable to fancy 3D animations this year, so instead we decided to explore different kinds of animated visuals. The most successful project was MycoDraw, a program that simulates mycelial growth using an image as a mapping of food concentration-- the mycelium grows fastest where the image is brightest, and consumes the brightness.
Although this didn't always make the prettiest images, we were able to adapt the program to produce excellent animations by breaking away from modeling the food concentration. We implemented it in Java and javascript, although we were unable to make the javascript run efficiently on certain browsers (notably Firefox). The code for the javascript can be found here .
