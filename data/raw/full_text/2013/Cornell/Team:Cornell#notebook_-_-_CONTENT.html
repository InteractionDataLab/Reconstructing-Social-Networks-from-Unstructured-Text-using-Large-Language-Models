			<DIV class="nb-onetech-i nohilite">show technical details</DIV></H6><DIV class="nb-tech">Speed-taboodunit is a mashup of speed-dating, taboo, and whodunit; the idea is that each person writes on a piece of paper something unusual about themselves, underlining the key words, then these pieces of paper are randomly redistributed. Everyone organizes in a speed-dating format, with two lines of people, and you have a minute to talk to them and try to find out if they're the person described on their piece of paper-- with the catch that they can't use any of the underlined words. People who successfully find their person leave the group, but otherwise after the minute everyone moves down the line. As for why we came up with this specific icebreaker, we wanted to hit two key requirements of icebreakers: they have to be fun, and they have to make specific accommodations for being shy or quiet. Because each person has the specific objective of finding their person, this helps them overcome the shyness, and as for the fun, everyone loves taboo!</DIV><P>		We had our first full team meeting today with all the new members, introducing them to the iGEM competition, and did an icebreaker we call speed-taboodunit! For the next week, they have the assignment of analyzing a previous iGEM project (in groups), and explaining what the project was trying to accomplish, whether synthetic biology was a good approach for this, and reasons for their success or lack thereof.

A new technique was used on a few of the digests involving a restriction cocktail of enzymes to cut the DNA. Plasmid pAK13AD was digested with EcoRI, SpeI, SacI, and ClaI so that it could be placed in pSB1C3. We used SpeI instead of PstI due to the small distance between the PstI and the SacI cut sites.  Plasmid pC13F was digested with EcoRI, SpeI, and KpnI so pAK13AD could be placed in it.  Plasmid pAK13D was digested with SpeI and PstI so <I>crtI</I> and <I>crtB</I> could be placed in it.  All the digests were then column purified rather than gel purified--a move which has improved our ligation efficiencies. The purifications were quantified.  Cultures were made for pC13P and pC13K and, finally, pAK13AD was dephosphorylated then ligated into pC13F in order to make pC13AH.</DIV><P>		Gibson <I>hph</I> was submitted for sequencing, and ALL of the cloning was performed.

Digestions of pC13M (<I>crtB</I>) and pC13E (T7 polymerase) were column purified and quantified.  The PCR of pC13K with GC and non-GC trials was redone, since the fragment was of the incorrect length during gel imaging yesterday - goal is to ligate to pAK13D.  Following the PCR, a gel was run which showed no bands. Perhaps the polymerase was forgotten? Another PCR of pC13K was performed and run on gel. A band showed at exactly 1.8kb as expected.  pC13M was ligated to pAK13D, placing <I>crtB</I> downstream of the T7 promoter.  pC13E was ligated to pC13P, placing the <I>T7</I> polymerase gene downstream of <I>PtrpC</I> (a native fungal promoter) - this is the first part of our genetic circuit with the second being the <I>T7</I> promoter upstream of various genes (<I>GFP</I> and <I>RFP</I> for diagnostic purposes - to quantify promoter functionality and the carotenoid genes for proof of concept).  Plates of pC13AH (T7 + crtY) had many colonies, so they were restreaked, and colony PCRs were run while cultures were made of some of the colonies.

All were screened by colony PCR as well.  Taq was used to perform 5 colony PCRs, then all colony PCRs were run on a gel.

The <I>CRE</I> gene amplified correctly and the sample was column purified, yielding 54.8ng/uL (with GC enhancer) and 49.9ng/uL (with non GC enhancer). We ran out of supplies to miniprep, so we pelleted pA13AM and pC13BG cultures and began to not so patiently await the arrival of a new miniprep kit. Our PCR of pC13F to append BamHI and KpnI cut sites yesterday failed completely, so we digested pC13F with KpnI to linearize it with an internal cut site in <I>mRFP</I> for another PCR to be run tomorrow. Another gel was run of the pC13AY digests and all lanes were blank. There may have been an issue in quantification by nanodrop that was reading over 1000 ng/Î¼L that mislead us into using low volumes of DNA for digestions. We decided to electroporate with the remaining pC13AY to miniprep and redo gel screening. On a brighter note, our restriction cocktail digestion of pA13BE with BamHI, KpnI and SacI showed a band at 500bp, which is the approximate length of <I>PpelA</I>. We also searched for a pAK13AN miniprep in the DNA storage box and for a glycerol stock of the same plasmid. We couldnât find either. However, we did obtain a plate of colonies that had been transformed with pAK13AN. We picked colonies off this plate to miniprep and send off to sequencing. In addition, we column purified our inserts from the PCR run yesterday of pC13Z and pK13AL. We then quantified inserts after column purification.

The advice was that we should blend <I>G. lucidum</I> which has been growing for an extended period of time, and make new cultures for a short period of time with the fungal &quot;smoothie&quot;. We also miniprepped pC13BM, pC13BJ, pC13BL, and pC13BK 6 &amp; 7. The LB stock of pAK13AC was made with the wrong antibiotic so we remade it. We also remade LB stock of pAK13AB. We miniprepped pC13A, pC13D, pC13F, pC13K, pC13L, pC13M, pC13N, pAK13BB, pC13AS, pC13W, and pC13Y. We plated pC13A, pC13D, pC13F, pC13K, pC13L.</DIV><P>		The miniprep kit finally arrived so we were able to continue progress on our pC13BG, pC13AY and pC13AW constructs.

This week, Manny and Mac focused their efforts on getting the plastic cut to the proper dimensions.  Unfortunately, this proved more to be more difficult than anyone could have imagined.  After transporting a rather hefty 48&quot;x48&quot; piece of plastic across campus from Weill Hall to the Emerson Lab machine shop, we were told that we would have to take it elsewhere to have it cut (plastic is bad for blades).  Disappointed, but never defeated, we decided to try our luck with another machine shop.  Also, carrying plastic around campus isn't much fun, so we held it on the roof of a car instead (not recommended).  Fortunately, no traffic violations were received, and the Clark hall machine shop was more than happy to cut up our plastic for us.

Finally, we decided it would be best if we just resorted to power tools.  We bought a jigsaw from Home Depot and cut the insulation like it was cheese.  After, we gazed fondly upon the jigsaw and reminisced about high school woodshop.

A culture of <I>G. lucidum</I> was diluted and homogenized, and 150 Î¼L aliquots were spread on plates and let dry.

The results from the growth assay do not look good. However, we found that the T7 polymerase in BL21 is controlled with an IPTG inducible promoter, so more pC13BA was grown with IPTG and plates were all re-inoculated with the corresponding amounts. An appropriate volume of LB was also added to some plates to account for mass changes. The zone of inhibition tests were also restarted with recultured (with IPTG) pC13BA.

The fabrication and electrical groups came together to begin combining and testing.  Initial tests with the temperature sensor yielded very positive results.  We were able to successfully set and reach a target temperature with our sensor/feedback system.  Unfortunately, our humidity sensor malfunctioned while we were running tests, however, we were still able to gather some data.  Initial humidity tests indicate that our misting apparatus is able to produce a 12% increase in humidity over a time span of 8 minutes.  Using a hotter water supply, as well as allowing the misting apparatus to run for longer would certainly allow us to increase humidity even more.

We set up PCRs of inserts from pC13AT, pC13AU, pC13AV, pC13AY, pC13CC, and pC13CE constructs to append HindIII and KpnI cut sites using new primers. The plan is to transfer the inserts into pAg13H and pAh13EA vectors. Next, we digested pAg13H and the successful PCRs of pC13AT, pC13AU, and ââpC13AVââ with HindIII and KpnI and ligated overnight. The successful transformants from yesterdayâs Gibson assemblies were cultured, and we ran a digest screen of all Psal minipreps with low yields: the image showed correct bands. Ran a PCR overnight of the <I>Psal</I> F and <I>Psal</I> R primers that just came in to amplify out Psal with its activator (nahR with P constitutive promoter). The SpeI cut site on will be appended by the reverse primer, while the forward primer is just amplifying the region already containing the BioBrick prefix.
