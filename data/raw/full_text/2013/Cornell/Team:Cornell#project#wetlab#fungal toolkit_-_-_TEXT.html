Fungal Toolkit
Scroll over each icon to find out more about the components of our toolkit!
Regulatory Elements
Provide modular protein expression controls for genetic constructs.
Selectable Markers
Allow for the selection of desired fungal transformants.
Characterization
Quantifies gene expression levels using fluorescent proteins.
Homologous Constructs
Enable integration of genetic constructs into specific regions of fungal genomes.
Biosafety
Implements measures to prevent horizontal gene transfer and induce a kill switch.
