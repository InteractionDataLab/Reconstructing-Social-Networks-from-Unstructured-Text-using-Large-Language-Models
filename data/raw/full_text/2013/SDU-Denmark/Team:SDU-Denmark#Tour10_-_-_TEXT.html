Introduction
Rubber demand, a new approach, and what we accomplished
Team logo.
Rising global demand for quality rubber calls for innovative ways of satisfying needs without compromising the environment. Natural rubber is produced by draining the rubber tree, and the establishment of new rubber plantations causes deforestation of the rainforest and occupation of arable lands.
We thought of an environmentally friendly approach. Imagine a world where natural rubber is produced by gene manipulated bacteria; perhaps inside fermentors that can be placed underground or in barren environments unsuitable for agriculture.
We introduced natural rubber-producing abilities from the rubber tree into the widely used production bacteria, Escherichia coli. Moreover, we tested whether the manipulated bacteria were in fact capable of producing the natural rubber.
The result? We found strong evidence for proof of concept: rubber producing bacteria. We look forward to presenting this - both throughout this wiki and at the jamborees.
The chassis of our production system will be the bacteria E. coli. The team carrying out the project consists of 9 undergraduate students in the fields of: medicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, biomedicine, and applied mathematics. Furthermore, our team was guided and supported by 3 supervisors from the university staff.
The wiki that exhibits our project has been thoroughly build from scratch in order for it to be good looking and easy to navigate. The tour have been developed especially for this wiki in order for the reader to take a quick comprehensive tour (Next chapter), or a more detailed trip for those interested in the detail (Dig deeper) via the two buttons in the buttom of the screen and the metro-map in the top. Enjoy your ride!
Dig deeper to read more about the team, who helped us, and how our wiki is different from other iGEM wikis. Or go to next chapter to learn more about the problem at hand.

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
