Coding
BBa_K1088000
The BioBrick contains the coding region of the dxs gene derived from the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis. Dxs is the first enzyme in the MEP pathway converting pyruvate and GAP GAPGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into DXP. DXP1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate Has been sequenced.
BBa_K1088003
The BioBrick contains the coding region of the HRT2 gene derived from Hevea brasiliensis and codon-optimized for Escherichia coli. HRT2 is the prenyl transferase that polymerizes IPP IPPIsopentenyl pyrophosphate and DMAPP DMAPPDimethylallyl pyrophosphate into rubber. Has been sequenced and HRT2 function characterized by H1-NMR.
BBa_K1088004
The BioBrick contains the coding region of the ispG gene derived from the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. ispG is the sixth enzyme in the MEP pathway converting MEcPP MEcPP2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate into HMB-PP. HMB-PP(E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate Has been sequenced.
BBa_K1088005
The BioBrick contains the coding region of the araC gene derived from the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. AraC is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the transcription of operons involved in arabinose metabolism. With glucose present AraC functions as a repressor, and without glucose and with arabinose present it functions as an activator.
BBa_K1088018
The BioBrick contains the coding region of the lacI gene derived from the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. LacI is a DNA-binding protein that inhibits the transcription from the lac promoter when allolactose or IPTG IPTGIsopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside is absent. Has been sequenced and LacI function characterized by FACS. FACSFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting and growth experiment.
Regulatory devices
BBa_K1088017
Pcon-araC-term: araC is being expressed from a constitutively active promoter. A terminator is put behind the coding region to prevent transcription of genes downstream of the activator. The device was used to check if we could enhance the control of the arabinose promoter. Has been sequenced and AraC function characterized by northern blot.
BBa_K1088019
Pcon-lacI(N)-term: lacI is being expressed from a constitutively active promoter. A terminator is put behind the coding region to prevent transcription of genes downstream of the repressor. The device was used to enable us to control the lactose promoter. This device proved be most effective together for expression control. LacI(N) function characterized by GFP fusion using FACS. FACSFluorescence Activated Cell Sorting and growth experiment.
BBa_K1088020
Pcon-lacI:LVA-term: lacI:LVA ( BBa_C0012 ) is being expressed from a constitutively active promoter. A terminator is put behind the coding region to prevent transcription of genes downstream of the repressor. The LVA-tag is a tag for degradation, and thus there is increased turnover of the protein. The device is meant to enable us to control the lactose promoter. However natural LacI proved to be more effective than the LVA-tagged. Has been sequenced and LacI:LVA function characterized by GFP fusion using FACS and growth experiment.
Reporter fusions

BBa_K1088008
Plac-dxs (B. subtilis):GFP expresses the dxs gene derived from Bacillus subtilis linked to GFP, and is under the control of the lactose promoter. The device is was used to check the expression level of the B.subtilis dxs gene under various conditions. Has been sequenced and Plac function characterized by GFP fusion using FACS.
