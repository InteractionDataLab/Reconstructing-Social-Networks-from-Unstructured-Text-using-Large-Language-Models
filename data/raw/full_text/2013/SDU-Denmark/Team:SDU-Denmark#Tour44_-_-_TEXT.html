SOPs
A complete anthology of good routines
“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more” - Henry V
We used an arsenal of self-written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to execute the vast amount of laboratory work. Each was written in collaboration with a person with experience in the field of the procedure and then approved by a second competent person. As such, it was strictly forbidden to change the SOPs without consulting the rest of the team, and any changes were then implemented in agreement. It was hereby secured that everyone in the lab were following the same procedures each time.
Below you can explore all our different SOPs
