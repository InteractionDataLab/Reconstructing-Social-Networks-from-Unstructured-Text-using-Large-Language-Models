<A class="dialogLink" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1088020">LacI:LVA device</A> were assayed to check for expression control. One triplicate of MG1655 and two triplicates of each MG1655 strains carrying either

</P><P><SPAN class="intro">The results</SPAN> show that strains lacking LacI:LVA do not repress expression from the lactose promoter. Even without induction, there is clear expression of GFP. Conversely, strains expressing LacI:LVA repress the promoter until induction. Approximately 90 min after induction of the strain expressing LacI:LVA, protein level is at its maximum. Still, maximum protein level is lower than that of the strain lacking LacI:LVA.

In summary the performance of LacI:LVA as a repressor did not live up to our expectations when comparing it to the constitutively active strains, nor when comparing it to the wildtype.

Both strains repress expression when uninduced. The strain expressing LacI:LVA reaches its maximum percentage of fluorescent cells approximately 150 min after induction, whereas the strain overexpressing natural LacI reaches its maximum after a mere 30 to 60 min. The maximum protein levels in the strain overexpressing natural LacI reaches a level approximately 3 times higher than the strain expressing LacI:LVA. Clearly, the function of the natural LacI is superior to that of LacI:LVA.

After 180 min upon induction, the strains expressing LacI:LVA with the IPTG concentrations ranging from 0.05-0.5mM reached approximately 25-30 % cells above the fluorescent threshold. Comparing this observation to the strains overexpressing the natural LacI, even the least induced (0.05mM) reached a higher percentage of cells above the fluorescent threshold after 180 min. All of the cells in the culture overexpressing natural LacI induced with 0.125-0.5mM IPTG are above the fluorescent threshold within 180 min. In general, the response time is faster for higher concentrations of IPTG.

At this OD, the one triplicate of each strain was induced with 0.05, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mM IPTG at time 0 min.

Upon induction of lacI(lva) with different concentrations of IPTG, the percentage of bacteria becoming fluorescent slowly increases. After approximately 180 min, 25-30 % of &lt;i&gt;lacI(lva)&lt;/i&gt; induced bacteria in the range from 0.05-0.5 mM IPTG are above the fluorescenct threshold. After 180 min, there is a slightly higher percentage of bacteria above the fluorescenct threshold than for the lacI(lva) strain induced with 10-fold higher IPTG concentration. All &lt;i&gt;lacI(N)&lt;/i&gt; induced with IPTG concentrations from 0.125-0.5mM become fluorescent within 180 min, and cultures with higher IPTG concentrations reach this point sooner. These results support what was seen in figure 2">

The natural LacI parts that have been submitted to the Registry by previous teams are pending (and thus did not pass HQ quality control). We have therefore submitted the coding sequence of natural LacI to the Registry for future teams to use as an improvement to the LacI:LVA biobrick. Furthermore, our experience has been added to the experience of the part encoding the LacI:LVA basic part (<A class="dialogLink" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0012">BBa_C0012</A>) on Parts Registry.

The normalized intensity of sample -&lt;i&gt;araC&lt;/i&gt; -2min were set to 1 and the other samples are relative to that. Within 15 min of induction the expression levels are at its maximum in both strains, and overexpression of AraC does not seem to be necessary for expression control of the arabinose promoter.

</A><SPAN class="intro">The HRT2 gene is under the control</SPAN> of the arabinose promoter (see <A class="dialogLink" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Tour33">Design</A>). We assayed the inducible capabilities of our design and, as part of the experiment, we tested the ability to suppress expression prior to induction. The assay was carried out by measuring the mRNA levels of HRT2 using the Northern blotting technique. 

<P><SPAN class="intro">To test whether overexpression of AraC improved expression control</SPAN>, devices with and without the

At this OD, the strains were induced with 0.2 % arabinose at time t=0 min, and samples were taken at times: -2 min, 15 min, and 30 min. Total RNA purified from the samples were run on a gel, blotted onto a membrane, and hybridized with probes specific for HRT2 mRNA and 5S rRNA (loading control), respectively. 


</P><P><SPAN class="intro">The results prove that we are capable</SPAN> of inducing our HRT2 devices with arabinose. There is only little expression before induction and within the first 15 min, expression is at its maximum. Overexpression of AraC does not seem to have an effect on the expression levels after 15 min compared to natural levels of AraC. However, it is inconclusive whether AraC might contribute to an effect at times less than 15 min after induction. <B>(Fig. 4)</B>.
