Showing gratitude to those we could not have done without
"I get by with a little help from my friends." - John Lennon
Sponsors
We would like to thank our sponsor University of Southern Denmark for giving us the funds for the project, making it possible for us to participate in iGEM. In particular, we would like to thank Dean Henrik Pedersen and the Faculty of Science at University of Southern Denmark. We would also like to thank Bionordika for sponsoring the USER-enzymes. And a great thank to ERASynBio for sponsoring our trip to the World Championship in Boston.
Laboratory support
We would like to thank Associate Professor, Ph.D. Jakob Møller Jensen & The Microbiology group, and the rest of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology for letting us use their lab and equipment for the duration of the project.
Our instructors Ph.D. Fellow Kirstine Jacobsen, Academic Assistant Tina Kronborg, and Ph.D Ann Zahle Andersen have been there for us all summer in our adversity and prosperity, an exceptional and gratefull thanks from us to them.
Medical Laboratory Technician Simon Rose helped us tremendously with safety; introducing us to the laboratory as well as aiding with the safety form.
Postdoc Anders Boysen helped troubleshoot when the PCR reactions were misbehaving.
Postdoc Mikkel Jørgensen gave us a lifesaving course in primer design.
Academic Assistant Eva Lillebæk answered our questions when needed in the everyday lab.
Associate Professor, dr. Paul Stein helped us with our characterization through NMR support.
Stud.cand.scient. Lennart Bjerre Nielsen and Ph.D. Fellow Pernille Lassen helped us with our characterization through MALDI support.
Academic Assistant, Ph.D. Lise Junker Nielsen helped us with our rubber purification process.
Ph.D. Tine Daa Schrøder helped us with our Dynamic Light Scattering measurements.
Head of Department (Institute of Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Environmental Technology), Professor, Lars Porskjær Christensen, Medical Laboratory Technician Hanne V. Hemmingsen, Medical Laboratory Technician Dorthe Lillesø, and Medical Laboratory Technichian Brian Hermansen all helped us with our GC characterization.
General support
The iGEM team from DTU hosted an iGEM crash course in April. They introduced us to the USER-cloning technique, which we have used for the duration  of our project.
Innovation - & Entrepreneurship Expert Sabina Kethelz held a course in project management, giving us the tools to create a better group dynamic and to tackle any problem that arose.
Associate Professor, Ph.D. Birthe Vester gave a lecture on antibiotic resistance at the DK meet-up.
DTU and UNIK-Copenhagen iGEM teams visited us at the DK meet-up and gave us some great feedback at the workshop.
Bioscientific dissemination at SDU gave us great feedback on our presentation in preparation of the jamboree.
Stud.cand.scient. Claus Asger Lykkebo did an amazing job, helping us designing and creating our own logo.
Technical support
Associate Professor Kristian Debrabant, helped with the some of the technical programming for the modeling of our system.
Systems developer, datamatician Kenneth Jensen helped us a great deal with the creation of our wiki, teaching us how to create a userfriendly site. He also helped with the more complex programming, such as the tour menu, as well as helping with general layout and design issues.ZeusSuperman
