Protocols & important dates
"If it is not documented, it doesn’t exist." - Louis Fried
Obviously, Louis Fried was wrong - and luckily so, we might add! But it is true that if it is not documented, we don't know whether it exist. So please, click through the tabs below and catch a quick glimpse of our most treasured moments of the summer. We kept a calender of special events since the start of the project. And if you have the yearning (particularly after reading our Results), open up our thorough protocols below.

When working together in a large group, particularly on such a large project, it is simply impossible for anyone to maintain an overview over the entire project in real time. That is why it is important to keep protocols of every part of the project, to document every experiment that is performed. This allows each team member to backtrack and to resolve any issues with (or mistakes made in) previous experiments. Countless digestions and hundreds of PCR reaction were done, and the explicit protocols established which setups were effective, and which were not. Our iGEM-team has kept protocols since the dawn of the project, and they have proven to be an invaluable resource, which saved us quite a bit of time. To ensure the consistency of execution, each experiment was done by following one of our Standard Operating Procedures, which can be found under "SOPs".
