You really should use our interactive wiki tour instead.  :) Don't worry, you won't miss out on anything. Everything below is part of the tour as well.

The future
Through the looking-glass, and what we hope to find there
Marty McFly: “What about all that talk about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?”
Dr. Emmett Brown: “Well, I figured, what the hell.”
We have shown that it is possible to make Bacteriorganic Rubber.
The stated goal of our project was to prove the concept - that it was indeed possible for E. coli produce rubber. Although not a part of the project, we also considered the possibilities and challenges a continuation of our project would bring.
The next steps are to optimize the bacterial rubber production. Then, if  resources were available, a scale production could be tested. The bacteria would be cultivated in a big container, possibly underground to not take up arable land, and rubber synthesis would be induced. At the appropriate time - after bacteria die from rubber poisoning -  rubber would be available to harvest, and the system would be ready to make a new batch.

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
