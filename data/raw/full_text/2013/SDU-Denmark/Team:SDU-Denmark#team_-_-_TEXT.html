About
3rd year bachelor student with a passion for working in the lab and obtaining results.
Major area of contribution
He had the overview of all the wet-lab projects, the subprojects, and the sub-subprojects. He helped the wet-lab newbies by explaining need-to-know stuff, thereby avoiding huge or irreversible mistake.

University of Southern Denmark (SDU)
The work was carried out in the Microbiology laboratory at the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Southern Denmark in the city of Odense.Odense University was established in 1966. In 1998, it merged with two other institutes of southern Denmark and became SDU. It has locations in multiple cities all over Denmark including Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse, and Copenhagen with a shared focus on education and research. There are approximately 3.200 employees and more than 20.000 students enrolled; about half live and study in the city of Odense. Source http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU
Odense
Odense is quite an extraordinary city. Even though it’s the 3rd largest city of Denmark, Odense only has 2 buildings taller than the 4th floor. The city name originates from “Odins Vi”, meaning a shrine for the worshiping of Odin, the allfather of all gods from the Nordic mythology.
Located on the isle of Funen, placed almost perfectly in the middle of Denmark and with it’s direct connection to the ocean through a cove, Odense was a rich city of trade. A number of Danish kings lived in the city, Knud the Holy was even killed on the altar of the Albani cathedral during a tax-induced revolt. However, any historical figure pales in comparison to the famous author and storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, the most cherished son of Odense.
Today, Odense is a city of knowledge. A fact that is hard to dispute with the University of Southern Denmark and Odense University Hospital being the two largest workplaces in the city.
