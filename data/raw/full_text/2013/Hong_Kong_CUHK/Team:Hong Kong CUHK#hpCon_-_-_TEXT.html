Conclusion and Future Plans
From the data that we got, many people still left uninformed about what is iGEM and synthetic biology. This is the same case for  hazards of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and Benzo[a]pyrene. Our project idea is well received by our audiences.
One’s religious belief affects the way a person responds to the idea of synthetic biology. Non-believers most welcome synthetic biology; there is no need to hesitate to make iGEM and synthetic biology widespread in Hong Kong and Macau as most of them are non-believers.
Parents’ of high school students mostly do not know what synthetic biology is. Most of the parents are welcome to purchase and use products from synthetic biology. We have to start approaching these adults with the idea of synthetic biology, then they can educate their youngsters about it. Lastly, many agree that synthetic biology will be an integral part of a knowledge-based economy in the future, for Hong Kong and Macau.
Information two-way flow from surrounding to individual can be mediated through our comic. As our data shown that surrounding affects an individual (ex. Religion) and an individual understanding about an important topic like synthetic biology may contribute to the way he/she sees the surrounding situation, like the economy structure preferred.
