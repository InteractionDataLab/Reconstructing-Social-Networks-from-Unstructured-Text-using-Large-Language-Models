Overview
The goal of our project is to develop a method using  E.coli to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into other less toxic  chemicals. PAHs are notorious for their damage on the environment and human  health. These compounds can be found anywhere, from second-hand smoke to  cooking fume. The wide spread and toxicity of PAHs indeed arouse our concern  and interest to tackle the issue.
We proposed the PAHs degradation system, which contains  codon-optimized laccase from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase  from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Escherichia coli. Laccase can first degrade  PAHs into quinones, and followed by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, quinones would  further be degraded into some simple carboxylic acid. The final product is a  much less harmful compound to the human body. For the regulation of this PAHs degradation  system, we added quinone sensing and response repressor (QsrR) from  Staphylococcus aureus, as quinones are generated at the beginning of the  metabolism.
Another great highlight of our project is the Voltage Switch  (VS), which can help to accelerate the PAHs degradation. We designed a novel  transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS), which is a fusion protein  utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium ion channels. Triggered by  change in potential across the cell membrane, VS can separate or bring  targeting enzymes into proximity; thus allowing an instant control of the enzymatic  reaction.
