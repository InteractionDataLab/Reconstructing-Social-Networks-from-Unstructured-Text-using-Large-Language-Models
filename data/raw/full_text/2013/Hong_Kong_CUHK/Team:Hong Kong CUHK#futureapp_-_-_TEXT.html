Future Application
Control enzymatic reactions
Voltage switch allows fast and easy control of enzymatic reaction rate by electricity.
We are working on demonstrating this with laccase and dioxygenase, and also BiFC
Bacterial Screening
Utilize the BiFC
Load cells onto multi-well plates
Each well serves as a Pixel
Degradation of cellular proteins
Utilize the Ubiquitin/26S proteasome system
Linking the voltage switch with E1/E2/E3 protein
Control degradation rate of cellular proteins by controlling ubiquitinylation rate
Study genes using protein complementation
Split genes into two parts, and insert into our system
Use voltage switch to control the split and refold of a gene.
Possible tool for the screening of new protein complementation compatible proteins.
Study Membrane Potential of Organelles
Target voltage switch system with BiFC onto the membrane of organelles interested
Obtain fluorescent signal
Estimate membrane potential
Address: Rm. 184, Science Centre, CUHK
