1.4  Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
A. Cast gel
1. Dissolve 0.55 g agarose  into 55 ml 0.5X TBE buffer.
2. Microwave (high power, 800W) for 1 min.
3. Cool it down using running water for 1 min.
4. Add 1 μl GelRed
5. Pour the solution to tightened tank with gates and gel comb and allow it to  solidify.
6. Transfer the gel to gel tank once it becomes solid.
B. Run gel
1. Orient the gel with  wells facing the black negative electrode. Check if the gel is covered by TBE  buffer in the tank. If not, add TBE buffer to cover it to about 1mm.
2. Mix loading dye and the insert/plasmid before adding to the wells. For  example, if the DNA we have got is 45μl, and the loading dye we have got is  10X, then add 5μl of loading dye to the samples. Mixture should be in blue.
3. To run the gel, add all samples to the wells of gel. Then add 1kb DNA ladder  to a separate well. 1μl should be enough for detection under UV.
4. Connect the electrodes to the power supply with correct colour. Set the  power supply to 120V. Check if there are bubbles on the negative electrodes.
5. Allow it to run for about 15-30min.  To avoid running the band off the gel, the yellow band (position of the  smallest fragments) should stay on the gel.

1.11 Gel Extraction ( Using  TaKaRa MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit Ver.4.0)
1.Excise the DNA fragment from  the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Cut the gel into small  pieces by cutting the gel
3. Weigh the gel pieces and  calculate the volume of gel. 1 mg of gel is equivalent to a
1 μl volume.
4. Add Buffer GM to gel for  melting. The amount of Buffer GM is shown in the table
below.
gel concentration Buffer GM
1.0％ 3X sample volume
1.0 - 1.5％ 4X sample volume
1.5 - 2.0％ 5X sample volume
5. Mix well and melt the gel  at room temperature (15 - 25℃). If the concentration of
gel is too high or the gel is  hard to melt, warm at 37℃. Intermittent vortexing will
accelerate gel solubilization.
Note: Gel must be completely  dissolved, or the DNA fragment recovery will be
reduced. Extend the melting  time when the gel concentration is high.
6. Set a Spin Column into  Collection Tube.
7. Transfer the solubilized  agarose from Step 7 into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm
for 1 minute. Discard the  flow-through.For improvement the recovery rate of DNA, transfer the  flow-through to SpinColumn again and centrifuge again.
8. Add 700 μl of Buffer WB  into the Spin Column. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 seconds.
Discard the flow-through.
Note: Make sure that the  amount of 100% ethanol specified on the bottle label has
been added to the Buffer WB.
9. Repeat Step 10.
10. Place the Spin Column back  into Collection Tube. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute.
11. Place the Spin Column into  a new 1.5 ml tube. Add 20 μl of 60℃ sterile
distilled water to the center  of the membrane. Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature and then  centrifuge.
12.Take back the flow-through  to the center of the membrane. Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature  and then centrifuge again.

2.1 Cell Viability Test with Voltage applied
We are applying continuous DC Voltage to  the samples by using batteries.
Cells used: BL21 transformed  with 2µL PSB1C3 + RFP
        Spread  on Chloramphenicol agar plate and incubate overnight in 37 °C
Pick 8 clones  into tubes with 10 mL of LB solution.   Add 10 µL of Chloramphenicol to experimental group tubes. Do  overnight shake in incubator for 16 hours to make the cells saturated.
After 16  hours, take out the tubes from the incubator.
 
Normalize the  samples to around 400 – 600 ABS with OD check (using 600nm wavelength) by  adding extra LB + Chloramphenicol.
       
Place 5 mL of  sample to each experimental tube. (6 voltages x 3 = 18 tubes)
Next, we  perform the experiment with voltage applied to each tubes.  We use one 9V battery for 9V, two 9V batteries  in series for 18 V, three 9V batteries in series for 27 V, four 9V batteries in  series for 36 V, and five 9V batteries in series for 45 V. Tubes will be shaken  under 250 rpm and 25°C for 24 hours. For each voltage, we have three samples.
Fig.  1 +9V circuit                   Fig. 2  +18V circuit
 
 
Fig. 3  +27V circuit                         Fig. 4 +36V circuit
Fig 5. +45V circuit
After 24  hours, we take the tubes out. Then we take 5 µL of each sample to perform serial  dilution. We performed 10X, 100X, 1000X and 10,000X dilution.
 
Take 1 µL  from each diluted solution to the Chloramphenicol agar ‘plate  table’ and streak on the square carefully. Then incubate the plates for 12  hours in 37 °C.
