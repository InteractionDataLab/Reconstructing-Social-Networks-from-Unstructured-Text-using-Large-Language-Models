Freshmen Booth in Art Fair
We opened a booth for  freshmen in a university event. It is aimed to promote iGEM and synthetic  biology to recruit next year’s team members. Other than that, we explain our  project ideas, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as well as Benzo[a]pyrene  hazards and get their response through surveys.
To make a chain distribution  of information, we published a mini-comic about iGEM and synthetic biology with  amusing bacteria characters. Aside from printed version, we also have an online  version published. The mini-comic comes in two languages, English and Chinese.  The information is pretty basic because we want to attract people’s attention  and let them know what it is. Let alone some non-science and non-engineering  students also visited our booth.
There is a QR code on our  stickers that direct to our online version of the comic. Thus, when people  stick the sticker on, others around them may find the bacteria characters intriguing and check on the comic by  scanning the code. More and more people in the campus will know about iGEM by  then.
Survey Analysis:  CUHK (Hong Kong) Students at Freshman Booth (110 students)
Firstly, we explore how well  they know about iGEM and synthetic biology.
 
The result shows that some people know what iGEM and  synthetic biology is but large proportions of them do not know what they are.
In relation to our project, we review whether they  have heard of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon or Benzo[a]pyrene.
In spite of its carcinogenicity, most of the  respondents do not know what Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon or Benzo[a]pyrene  are.
We investigate their response towards our project  ideas.
Interesting and useful are the most common response  that we got. This encourages  us further to work out all our best in doing the project.
Beyond home, religion has been a great issue for  synthetic biology. Interestingly, 50% Hong Kong’ population are non-believers  or having other minority beliefs. The correlation between religious beliefs to  acceptability of synthetic biology among the university students is illustrated  below.
The results indicated that, there is various insight  of synthetic biology among different religious belief. Non-believers most  welcome synthetic biology well.
The results from religion and personal point of view  are similar. This shows that high school student’s view on synthetic biology  relates directly to their religious belief.
Lastly, we assess their response on the comic.
The comic attracted the readers well as  the majority rated it 3 or 4 for being interesting.
The comic delivers the content properly  to make the reader understand.
The  comic has successfully improved reader’s understanding on both iGEM and  synthetic biology.
