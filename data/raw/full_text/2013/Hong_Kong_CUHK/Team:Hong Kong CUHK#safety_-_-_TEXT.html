Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues  in terms of:
researcher safety
public safety
environmental safety
Our project ideas will not raise any safety issues.  Our project only makes use of non-virulent E. coli (DH5α and BL21). Public health  risk will not occur due to the non-pathogenic property of the bacteria used. Even though our project involves  Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and Quinone, but they are both used in a very low  concentration. With low concentration, their toxicity and carcinogenicity have  been greatly reduced and considered as safe for individuals and the environment.
In the  beginning of iGEM, each of our member has received a Biological Safety Training  and General & Chemical Safety Training. Which include safety related concepts,  basic emergency procedures and how to handle microorganisms. We all have obtained a certificate to operate in a  Biosafety Level 1 laboratory. In this way we have ensured the researcher safety  throughout our project process.
Before  disposal, all bacteria stocks and laboratory wastes are autoclaved. If there is  accidental release, there is no health risk will be caused due to the  non-virulent and non-pathogenic properties of bacteria used.
 
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year  raise safety issues?
Our new BioBricks parts will not raise any safety issues. They do not acquire  any pathogenic mechanism that may cause harm to human health.
According to WHO an organism is  categorized as Risk Group 2 (moderate  individual risk, low community risk) if it is a pathogen that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be  a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the  environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective  treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of  infection is limited.
Even though some of our inserts  come from organisms under the Risk Group 2. All of these inserts are  synthesized and none of them comprises the characteristics that make them  categorized in the Risk Group 2 organisms. The inserts are used for repressor,  scaffolding protein and enzyme expression, which will not cause any harm to  individuals and the environment.
 
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your  institution?
Yes, there is University Safety Office of the Chinese University of Hong  Kong.  One representative officer has  visited our lab and performed a risk assessment. In overall, he is satisfied  with our working conditions. We have discussed our project details with them. One  important reminder that the officer gave is to use fume cupboard when diluting  Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) to lower concentration. As high concentration is B[a]P is  considered as hazardous to the researcher.
The officer categorizes our project as BioSafety Level 1 and it is a low  risk project.
 
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could  be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be  made even safer through biosafety engineering?
2012 CUHK iGEM Team’s new safety approach is good to be incorporated to  BioBrick Design. This will definitely eliminate safety issues if there is  accidental release of bacteria with transformed plasmid to the environment.  Their new safety approach is a controlled suicide system, which target the  antibiotic resistance gene or the standard site of the BioBrick  such as prefix and suffix.
