Abstract
Switch off PAHs
Polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are harmful to both environment and human health.  We proposed the PAHs degradation system, which contains codon-optimized laccase  from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 for Escherichia coli...
Parts
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts...
The system  was capable of degrading PAHs into less toxic simple carboxylic acid. Also,  since quinones are intermediates in the pathway, we added quinone sensing and  response repressor (QsrR) to regulate the degradation process. To accelerate  the degradation, we used Voltage Switch (VS), the other great highlight of our  project. We designed a novel transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS),  which is a fusion protein utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium  ion channels. Triggered by change in potential across the cell membrane, VS can  separate or bring targeting enzymes into proximity; thus allowing an instant  control of enzymatic reaction.
 The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The "groupparts" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox. Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry, not on your team wiki.
Voltage Switch
Another great highlight of our project is Voltage Switch. In order to increase the efficiency of PAHs degradation pathway, we design a novel switch triggered by electricity. The switch includes differently combined protein domains that regulate the distance between enzymes.
PAH Degradation
We propose a pathway of PAH degradation, which is carried out by a combination of enzyme laccase and catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase....
 
It allows fast control of concentration of reaction mixture, thus achieving fast response by electricity. Apart from using Voltage Switch, we also try to link the two enzymes together as a reaction complex by Protein Scaffolding, the project from SJTU 2012 iGEM team.
The final product is a kind of simple carboxylic acid, which is less harmful to human body. Since quinones are generated in the beginning of the metabolism, we use quinone sensing and response repressor (QsrR) to control the degradation process.
