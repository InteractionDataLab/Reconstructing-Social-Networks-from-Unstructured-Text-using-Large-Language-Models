Voltage Switch
Voltage Switch is a response system triggered by a change of potential  across the bacterial inner membrane. Components of this system include the transmembrane  voltage sensor peptide originated from potassium ion channels, polyproline  linker in the inner membrane, glycine serine linker, PDZ domain and PDZ ligand  in the periplasm, and glycine serine linker and effectors in the cytosol.
1. Components of Voltage Switch System
Voltage Sensor Peptide
Voltage sensor peptide, originated from the archaea Aeropyrum pernix, is a protein domain  found in a voltage-dependent potassium ion channel. Previous studies suggested that  the domain could translocate within the membrane upon membrane potential change  [10, 11]. This helix peptide received its voltage-sensing ability from its four  positively-charged arginine residues, and high hydrophobicity from its numerous  leucine residues.
PDZ Domain and PDZ Ligand
This is a dimer found in Mus  musculus, and were used by the 2012 SJTU iGEM team as a membrane  scaffolding tool. The PDZ dimer provides the necessary linkage of the two fusion  proteins in the voltage switch system.
Polyproline Linker
Polyproline linker is a pure proline rigid rod. Its rigidity is due to  the limited rotation of peptide bonds in proline, a ring-shaped amino acid.  Also, proline does not contain any hydrophilic functional group, which makes  the linker hydrophobic and thus able to stay within the inner membrane.
Glycine Serine Linker
This is a hydrophilic flexible linker which links PDZ dimer with voltage  sensor peptides. It also links the polyproline linkers in the membrane with the  effectors in the cytosol.
Effectors
These effectors can be changed accordingly. In our project, we chose  laccase and dioxygenase for BaP degradation. We also planned to test the system  with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) dimerization.  To become functional, the PDZ domain and PDZ ligand bind the two protein  fragments together, forming a stable dimer.
2. Proposed Mechanism of Switching “ON” and “OFF” in the System
Switching “OFF”
When no external charge is applied, the two effectors are combined, as  the repulsion force between the two positively-charged voltage sensor peptide  is relatively smaller than the dimer effect. The two voltage sensor peptides  are vertically parallel to each other.
Switching “ON”
When negative charge is applied into the system, the two effectors are  separated. As the potential across the membrane is inverted, there is an  attractive force between negatively-charged periplasm and positively-charged  voltage sensor peptide, and vice versa for cytosol and voltage sensor peptide.  Together, these two forces pull the two voltage sensor peptides from vertical  position to more horizontal, which causes the separation of the effectors.
