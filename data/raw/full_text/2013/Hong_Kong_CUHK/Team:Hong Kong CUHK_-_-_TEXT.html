Abstract
To rapidly regulate biological process, we designed a novel transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS), which is a fusion protein utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium ion channels. Triggered by a change of potential across the inner membrane, VS can bring targeting enzymes into proximity, thus allowing an instant control of enzymatic reaction...
Human Practice
Interest and mindset formation should start at young  age for permanence and  continuity. High school and university students are  great audiences  to be  approached to break the blurred paradigm of synthetic  biology, which term is rarely  known by the general public...
Voltage Switch
Voltage Switch is a response system triggered by a change of potential across the bacterial inner membrane. Components of this system include the transmembrane voltage sensor peptide originated from potassium ion channels, polyproline linker in the inner membrane, glycine serine linker, PDZ domain and PDZ ligand in the periplasm, and glycine serine linker and effectors in the cytosol...
 
PAH Degradation
Our project initiated from dealing with toxic chemicals found in second-hand smoke (or environmental  tobacco smoke, ETS) and cooking fume. After carefully examining the composition  of pollutes, we noticed that there was one group of highly toxic...
