Abstract
To rapidly regulate biological process, we designed a novel  transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS), which is a fusion  protein utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium ion channels.  Triggered by a change of potential across the inner membrane, VS can bring  targeting enzymes into proximity, thus allowing an instant control of  enzymatic reaction. We also utilized VS to accelerate the polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation system — another highlight of our  project. The metabolites of certain PAHs are mutagenic and carcinogenic. We  codon-optimized laccase from Bacillus  sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Escherichia  coli, which when forming a cascade, can degrade PAHs into less toxic  simple carboxylic acid. For regulation, we added quinone sensing and response  repressor (QsrR) to control the degradation, as quinones are intermediates in  the pathway.
