Abstract
Polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are harmful to both environment and human health.  We proposed the PAHs degradation system, which contains codon-optimized laccase  from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida  KT2440 for Escherichia coli. The...
Human Practice
Interest and mindset formation should start at young  age for permanence and  continuity. High school and university students are  great audiences  to be  approached to break the blurred paradigm of synthetic  biology, which term is rarely  known by the general public...
Voltage Switch
The voltage-dependent ion channels family are a  group of ion channel proteins found to have permeability to ions dependent on  the voltage in the external environment. This family of ion channels are widely  found in neuronal cells...
 
PAH Degradation
Our project initiated from dealing with toxic chemicals found in second-hand smoke (or environmental  tobacco smoke, ETS) and cooking fume. After carefully examining the composition  of pollutes, we noticed that there was one group of highly toxic...
