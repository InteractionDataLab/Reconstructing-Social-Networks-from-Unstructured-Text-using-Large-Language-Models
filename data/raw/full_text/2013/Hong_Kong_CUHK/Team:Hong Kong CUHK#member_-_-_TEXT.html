Leader: Jennifer
Full name: Chih-Chieh CHANG
Programme of study: Cell and Molecular Biology
Contributions: Biobricks design, Molecular Cloning, Human Practices
Hello, I am Jennifer, a sophomore Taiwanese girl from CUHK. In the past few months, I have gained much more synthetic biology knowledge and lab skill. Also, due to interacting with local team mates, I finally pick up some Cantonese and Hong Kong culture. So far, joining iGEM is the most exciting thing in my college life. It is such a thrilling experience to brainstorm up an idea and try to work it out in lab. I truly look forward to share our group project with iGEMers around the world.

Hi, I'm Eddie from the CMBI program. Since my earlier age, I've always been dreaming of becoming a great scientist. Having been able to participate in iGEM have been my pleasure, but at the same time it takes away a lot of my brain power lol. It has been my very first attempt trying to make my dream come true. I hope to see you all in the world jamboree!

Contributions: Human Practice, Sponsorship, Wet Lab, Modelling
Hi! I’m Melisa, a Chinese Indonesian. I have deep interest in Medicine and Engineering. Reading Business and Psychology books and playing Cello are my idiosyncratic recreations. I love alternative rock music and Hello Kitty a lot, seriously. Through iGEM I have learned a lot of Life Science topics and lab techniques that I will not acquire from my major studies. iGEM has opened my eyes to infinite possibilities offered by synthetic biology. It has been an exciting roller-coaster experience to join this year’s iGEM. It is the most unforgettable summer that I have ever had!

Self intro : Hi ,  I am ar sze, I am a year two undergrad studying Biochemistry, . I love to do  lab works and enjoy doing research-like studies, that's why I joined iGEM. iGEM is a great  competition which allow students to learn more about synthetic biology and make  biobricks ourselves. There  were unforgettable memories with our teammates after we spend the whole summer  together in the lab.  iGEM not only let me know more friends with the same  interest, it also allows  me to learn more laboratory skills. I  am glad to have a chance taking part in this competition. It is worth our effort.  Good luck my friends in the coming jamboree :)

iGEM gives me the chance to  spend the lonesome summer holiday in the lab, to taste the sweetness and  bitterness of working as a researcher, and to build our dream starting from  scratch. I have spent a lot of sad time watching pieces of blank agarose gel or  bare culture plates, but also a lot of happy time enjoying my success in  cloning and good news from DNA sequencing. iGEM conveys the idea of creativity,  efficiency, hard work, and also persistence, which should be valued by all  scientists of tomorrow. Let us all appreciate the infinite possibility of  synthetic biology through iGEM!
Gill
Full  name: CHAO Han
Programme  of study: Molecular Biotechnology
Contributions:  Focus on Wet Lab and human practice
Hi:) I  am Gill from Taiwan and currently a year two student in CUHK. The part I like  IGEM competition most is that IGEM is a student-oriented competition. Thus,  Other than cultivating research abilities and learning important scientific  techniques, IGEM taught me much more than these. Since we have limited time and  resource, I learn to cherish and arrange what we have and make best use of them  in an efficiency way. As a nonlocal student, I learn to cooperate with students  with different background and overcome language barrier. After spending whole  summer in the lab, I gonna miss all these crazy days and nights  in the lab.

Hello, I’m Natalie. Participating in iGEM is a very precious experience for me. I tried plenty of different things that are completely new for me, such as doing lab works, contacting different biotech companies, holding talks for high school students, etc. It feels really good when you successfully solve new challenges and each time I gained a lot form them. All my teammates are also very integral parts of why this competition is so enjoyable. Though each of us has distinct personalities, we got the same goal of perfecting our project. I’m really glad that I can join iGEM, winning knowledge and friendships from it.

Last year, I learnt about iGEM in the Art Fair. This year, I was there promoting iGEM to new students. I am so glad that I signed up last year. I stepped into this brave new world the day we started brainstorming for ideas. Although it was a frustrating and repeating process of trial and error, I enjoy the learning process throughout the project. It is my pleasure to work with my team members, who are talented people from different disciplines. This summer is a truly unforgettable one. I am looking forward to seeing you all in the Jamboree.

As a biomedical engineering student, I believed I could learn a lot from iGEM because it is a bridge between biology and engineering.As a result,several months earlier, I decided to join CUHK iGEM team. After several months' hard-working, I gained more than what I had expected.Learning website building, participating in wet lab,promoting our project and working with the magical team members really gave me an unforgettable experience!Though we had a hard time during the months, I believe we did not waste our time.
