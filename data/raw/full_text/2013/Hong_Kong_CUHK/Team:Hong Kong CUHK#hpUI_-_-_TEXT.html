University Students - International
Survey Analysis:  International University Students (110 students)
The students are of various academic programs.
We acquire students view on bacteria in general.
Most of the respondents considered bacteria as neither  good nor bad.
We also investigated their view on genetic  engineering.
Most of our respondents are not familiar with genetic  engineering as most of them categorize it as confusing.
iGEM or synthetic biology are quite well known among  international students. Half of the respondents do not know what are they but  the other half know what is iGEM or synthetic biology or both.
Despite of its hazards, almost all of the respondents  have no idea about what is Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon and Benzo[a]pyrene.
Lastly, we compare the number of the iGEM teams coming  from each country that our respondents come from to the number  of them knowing either iGEM or Synthetic Biology.
