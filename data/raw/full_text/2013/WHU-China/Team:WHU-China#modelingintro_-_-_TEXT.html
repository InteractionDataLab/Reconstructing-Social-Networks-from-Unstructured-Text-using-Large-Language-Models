Modeling introduction
The primary aim of our model is to enable people to design their own multi-stage promoter. It consist of 3 part. The first part is the overall user guideline of Multi-stage promoter design. The other two parts are two models that tackle with specific question. If you want to design your own multi-stage promoter, start from here . If you want to know more about tandem promoter and design your own tandem promoter, please check our TP model . The TP model aims at predicting the expression level of a tandem-repeat promoter system. With the help of this model, one can employ limited expression element to reach a desired expression level in any species, especially in non-model organisms that have few known expression element. If you want to know more about Cas9 off-target behavior and choose your Cas9 target sequence wisely, please check our Cas9Off model . It takes a nucleic acid thermodynamics approach and analyzing all off-target studies published. Hope that it will be useful for your research!
