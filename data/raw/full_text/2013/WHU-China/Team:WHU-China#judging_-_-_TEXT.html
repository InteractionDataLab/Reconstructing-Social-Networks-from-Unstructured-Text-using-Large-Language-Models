Judging
Regional iGEM Medals
All teams can earn medals. Teams must nominate themselves using the Judging Form, which will be available later. The three levels of medals, from lowest to highest are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Requirements for each medal are:
Bronze. The following 5 goals must be achieved:
1.Team registration.
2.Complete Judging form.
3.Team Wiki.
4.Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5.Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry We submitted several BioBricks to the registry, for more information click patrs submitted to registry
Silver: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals must be achieved:
1.Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.          patrs submitted to registry
2.Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.          patrs submitted to registry
3.Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).          patrs submitted to registry
4.Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.          safety issues
Gold: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
1.Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An "improvement" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the entire community; and of course, troubleshooting and fixing a part reported to be non-functional. Data from an experimental comparison between the original and improved part/ device is strongly recommended. We improved the J23102 J23106 J23116
2.Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. We helped Shenzhen_BGIC_ATCG team with their project , offering a part dCas9 , which is experimentally proved functional.
3.Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
Great jobs we have done
We devised the tandem promoter scheme to combine a few promoter to precisely express target gene at a required level. Experiments were carried out to prove the feasibility of this plan. A model was constructed to predict the strength of tandem promoter, given the kinds, the number and the order of sub-promoters. We proposed the multistage promoter scheme to switch the expression between several ideal level. Experiments were done to construct the system. In order to insure the orthogonality of the system, the off-target tendency of the regulating protein - dCas9, has been carefully modeled by analyzing the data from six paper about Cas9 off-target behavior.
