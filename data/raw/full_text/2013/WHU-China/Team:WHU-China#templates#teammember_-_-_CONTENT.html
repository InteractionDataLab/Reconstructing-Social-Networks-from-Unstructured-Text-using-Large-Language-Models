Hello world, we are 2013 iGEM WHU-China.
We are the third team of Wuhan University attending iGEM jamboree. Of course, it is great to have a good tradition here, the senior team member lead us to this amazing field of synthetic biology and give us tremendous help either in experiment or other parts of this match. 
What is more important is that we combine those with our novel ideas, passion and efforts. Every time when we carry out a brain storm, when we debate for a better solution or when we do experiment throughout the whole night, fire are burning in our heart, because we know the world will be a little different, a little better by what we are doing. 
From December 2012, we have passed 8 months. And steps never stop, even in the Spring Festival, meeting online kept our minds together. Although we have experienced the pains of member changing, everyone who loves this team devotes what he or she can. 
Now it is the time for WHU-China to give you all a surprise. 
And it is time for us to give a answer to ourselves! 
Here we come. <H1 style="font-size=20px;"><STRONG>Members</STRONG></H1><DIV style="width:100%;min-height:176px;height:auto;margin-top:15px;border-bottom:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0, 0.15);-webkit-box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0, 0,0, 0.15);"><P>

Our instructor, Dr. Xie, joined the microbiology department of college of life science in Wuhan University as docent starting in July, 1999 and as professor since 2007. His degree is BA in Biochemistry in Wuhan University (1991), followed by SM in Zoology and PhD in Genetics at Wuhan University (1996, 1999). And he had a post-doctoral experience in college of chemistry &amp; molecular science (1999-2002), which made him hold comparable ranks in the interdiscipline of biology and chemistry. Professor Xie is a prominent and widely respected figure in the both microbial genetic transformation filed and intracellular quantum dots study. And as an instructor, he gave us a lot instructions on the determination of the final project and suggestions when we were in trouble while guaranteeing every freedom for us to think and to realize our design.
Furthermore, he was more like a loving father rather than just a cool-minded academic instructor. Everytime we came across, he would greet us happily and talk about the progress of our project, the situation of our in-class learning and the trouble of our daily life, always giving a hand when we are in need. 
In a word, those who need help will always get help from Dr. Xie, both on academic and in personal life. </P></DIV><DIV style="padding:5px;width:100%;min-height:249px;height:auto;margin-top:15px;border-bottom:1px solid  rgb(204,204,204);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0, 0.15);-webkit-box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px rgba(0, 0,0, 0.15);"><P><B>Jianbo WANG</B>
