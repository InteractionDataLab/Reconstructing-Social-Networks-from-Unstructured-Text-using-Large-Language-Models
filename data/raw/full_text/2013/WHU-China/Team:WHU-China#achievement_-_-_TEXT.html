Scince the off-target effect of CRISPR/Cas9 hindered the application of CRISPR/Cas9 system, it's urgent to probe into it, and we quantified the off-target probability of a certain guide RNA and created a software to predict the off-target probability of a given guide RNA. The process is described in Modeling We have submitted 9 bricks to the registry, listed in the Parts submitted We accomplished many task, many of which meet the standard of the regional medals, and we also did excellent in some aspect concerning the special prizes. For the key point of our work, please view the part Judging
