Composing a team
We were given the opportunity to select members from various faculties to compose our own iGEM team. Qualities of our Hypnoseq member should be adventurous, committed and have a passion for research.
Brainstorming
After our team was constructed, our members came up with a few possible ideas/ projects for the competition. Basic researches were done to support the ideas for future selection.
Team selection
Our team members then presented the ideas/ projects at our campus iGEM preliminary round. The possible ideas were then assessed and voted by our advisor and peers.
Human practice
Out team members went to a few junior high schools to promote synthetic biology to the scholars. Surveys were also handed out after the presentation so we have an overall perception of their understanding of synthetic biology.
Launching Wiki
After our direction was set and our goal was clear, we started to construct our iGEM webpage, filling in related details and keeping our records up to date.
Kick start to our experiment
In order to save time, we did some basic preparations for the experiment before all the parts were received. Preparations include primer design, preparing LB plates, making competent cells etc. so when the biobrick is received the actual experiment may start immediately.
