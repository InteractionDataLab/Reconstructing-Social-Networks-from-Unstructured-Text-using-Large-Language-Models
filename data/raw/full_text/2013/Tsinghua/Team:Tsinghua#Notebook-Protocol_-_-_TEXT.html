Fragment DNA isolation from agarose gel
Agarose Electrophoresis
A mixture of various sized DNA fragments were separated in an agarose gel (from 0.8 to 1.5% agarose in 1x TAE buffer ethidium bromide) at a constant voltage of 150 V.
UV light (λ = 254 nm) was used to visualize DNA with intercalated ethidium bromide.
Fragment Isolation from agarose gel
The band with the desired DNA fragments were excised from the gel, using a clean scalpel.
DNA was isolated from the gel slice with Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Purity and amount of DNA was determined using NanoDrop.
Restriction digest
To digest the desired DNA restriction reactions were prepared as follows:
For analysis of cloned DNA
2µl of the appropriate restriction buffer (10X)
0.5 µL restriction enzyme
Bring volume to 20 µL with nuclease-free water.
Or
For isolation of specific DNA
2µl of the appropriate restriction buffer (10X)
Up to 2 µL restriction enzyme
Bring volume to 50 µL with nuclease-free water.
The sample was incubated at optimal temperature for the restriction enzymes.
Analysis of fragmented DNA was done by gel electrophoresis.
Desired DNA fragment was excised and purified using suitable DNA purification kit.
Ligation
T4 ligase ligates the 5' phosphate and the 3'-hydroxyl groups of DNA.
Vector and insert concentrations were estimated and insert and vector fragments joined in a molar ratio of 3:1 (100-150ng Vector DNA).
A ligation mixture was prepared:
1X ligase buffer (10X)
1 µL T4 ligase (3 U/µL)
Bring volume to 10 µL with nuclease-free water.
Reactions were incubated at 17 °C for 4 to 18 hours.
After incubation part of the ligation mixture was used for the transformation of bacterial cells (see: transformation of bacteria).
Culturing bacteria
For plasmid DNA propagation two bacterial strains were used: DH5alpha and TransT1.
Growth media for bacteria
Luria Broth (LB) : 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, media is supplemented with suitable antibiotics depending on the selection marker on the transfected plasmid: ampicilin 100 mg/L or kanamycin 50 mg/L.
LB agar plates: LB with 1.5% agar, media is supplemented with suitable antibiotics depending on the selection marker on the transfected plasmid.
Transformation of bacteria
E. coli DH5alpha and TransT1 competent cells were used for the propagation of plasmid DNA.
100 µL of competent cells were thawed on ice.
50 – 400 ng DNA solution was added to competent bacterial cells (depending on the concentration of the DNA solution).
A mixture of cells and DNA solution was incubated on ice for 30-60 minutes.
The mixture was heat-shocked for 3 minutes at 42 °C.
Cooled for 3 minutes on ice.
500 µL of preheated antibiotic free LB-medium was added and incubated for one hour at 37 °C with agitation for the purpose of inducing antibiotic resistance.
The selection for plasmid containing and therefore antibiotic resistant bacteria was conducted by plating them on antibiotic containing LB-agar plates.
Plasmid DNA isolation
MINI PREPs for analysis and sequencing
A single colony was picked from a LB-agar plate or glycerol stock and inoculated in 10 mL of LB-medium with the appropriate antibiotic for selection (100 mg/L ampicillin, 50 mg/L kanamycin, 35 mg/L chloramphenicol).
Bacteria were grown over night at 37 °C with agitation.
Plasmid DNA was isolated from 6-10 mL of over-night culture with plasmid miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Amounts ranging from 6-10 µg of plasmid DNA were obtained.
The purity and concentration of the isolated DNA was analyzed using NanoDrop.
Yeast Transformation Protocol
Inoculate a single colony of the desired yeast strain to be transformed into 5 ml YPD or selective media and grow overnight at the appropriate temperature.
From the above overnight culture, inoculate into 5 ml YPD/selective media the appropriate amount to make the culture's optical density at 600 nm (OD600) equal to 0.1.
Shake at the appropriate temperature until OD600 is between 0.6 and 1.0 (Normally I won’t let the OD reach over 1.0. Depends on strains, it may take 6-8 hours).
Pellet cells 5 min at 3,000 rpm at room temperature.
Wash the cells with 1ml ddH2O and transfer them into 1.5ml eppendorf tube. Pellet the cells at 3000rpm for 1min and remove the supernatant.
Wash the cells with 1 ml 0.1M LioAc/TE buffer. Pellet cells and resuspend in 100ul of 0.1M LioAc/TE.
Aliquot 20 ul of cell suspension into each of tube and add 2ul of plasmid DNA
Add 80ul of transformation solution and mix well by pipetting up and down for several times
Transformation Solution (each):
50% PEG   62.4ul
1M LioAc      8.22ul
DMSO       9.58ul
10mg/ml ssDNA  5ul
Incubate the plate at 30°C for 30min (can be longer but not shorter than 30min)
Heat shock by placing in a 42°C water bath for 15min
Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 1min.
Remove the supernatant.
Wash the cells with 100ul of 5mM CaCl2. Pellet the cells (3000rpm, 1min) and remove the supernatant.
Add 100ul of ddH2O, mix well on the plate shaker.
Plate cells onto selective plates.
AHL induction and flow cytometry analysis
The response of engineered yeast to AHL quorum sensing signals was examined using pTF4 transformants, where AHL signals would be recognized by LuxR receptors, thereby promoting mCherry fluorescent protein expression. Induced fluorescence was checked using flow cytometry analysis. Samples were prepared as specified below.
pTF4 transformant yeast was cultured in SC-His selective medium from 0.1 OD for 8 hours, at 30 ℃, shaking culture.
Yeast cells were induced with AHL.
a. 0.5 μM AHL induction:  Added 25 μL AHL (0.1 mM stock solution) into 5 mL pTF4 transformant yeast culture.
b. Ctrl: Added 25 μL ddH2O as control.
30℃ shaking culture.
Sample fixation: 0.5h, 2h, 8h and 24h post-induction: Collect 500 μM sample and fix in 10% formalin for 15 min. Formalin was removed after fixation and yeast cells were resuspended in 500 μM PBS and stored at 4℃.
Samples were subjected to flow cytometry analysis to check for mCherry fluorescence. Negative control was established using native yeast with no mCherry expression.
Western Blot Protocol
Sample Preparation
Add 100µl 0.2M NaOH into 100µl yeast culture media. Incubate at room temperature for 5min. Centrifuge at 7000 rpm for 1min. Remove the supernatant.
Resuspend the cells in 50µl SDS sample buffer. Incubate at 100℃ for 5min. Centrifuge at 7000 rpm for 1min. Keep the supernatant. Store at -20℃.

Add protein sample to each well.
Then use 100V to run. When the proteins reach the boundary of separation and stacking gel, you can change the voltage into 140V. Stop when the proteins reach the bottom of gel.
Blocking and Antibody Incubation
Use the 5% milk blocking buffer to block the NC membrane at room temperature for 1h.
Transfer the NC membrane to first antibody buffer (rabbit anti-flag 1:4000), at 4℃ overnight.
Use the PBST to wash the NC membrane for 3 times, each for 10min at least.
Then transfer the NC membrane to the second antibody buffer (rabbit anti-IgG 1:10000). Incubate at room temperature for 1h.
Use the PBST to wash the NC membrane for 3 times, each for 10min at least.
