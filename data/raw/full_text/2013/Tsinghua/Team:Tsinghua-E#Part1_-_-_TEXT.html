Part 1: THU-E Mutation Part
A plasmid  used for the construction of high-diversity library in vivo ingenome level. In  this vector, highly error-prone dnaQ mutant, mutD [1] was cloned downstream  of araBAD promoter to control the  mutation rate of the target genome by the concentration of araBAD promoter’s inducer, L-arabinose, in a strict manner.E. Coli JM109 carrying different vectors  of pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP, pBAD_B0032-mutD-sfGFP and pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-sfGFP(this RBS sequence was derived  from the RBS sequence upstream of sfGFP in original AraC_pBAD_CI_OR222-sfGFP  vector [2] )were  constructed. By detecting the induced fluorescence intensity, we found that pBAD_B0030-mutD-sfGFP,  andpBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD- sfGFPhave  relatively higher mutD expression. The increaseof mutation rate induced  by our mutation part was measured by quantifying the reversion of rifampinresistance  caused by mutation in genome.pBAD_SDA_RBS-mutD-  sfGFPcould increase the genome mutation rate up to 10 times compared with  negative control with 1g/L induction concentration of L-arabinose.
