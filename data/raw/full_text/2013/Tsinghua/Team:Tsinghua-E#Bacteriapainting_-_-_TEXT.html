Bacteria Painting
Nothing can be more impressive than take a visit to bio-lab and do something yourself. Thus we invite students in junior grades from Tsinghua University to visit our lab and to draw whatever they like using a kind of engineering e-coli that can produce violacein. By these way, most students set up their first impression of bio-lab and engineering bacteria.
