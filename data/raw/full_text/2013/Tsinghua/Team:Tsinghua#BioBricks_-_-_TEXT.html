Six BioBricks were constructed to engineer a pathogen-detecting yeast strain and benchmark its efficiency. BBa_K1024000 and BBa_K1024001 were prokaryotic LuxR and pLux BioBricks Parts optimized for yeast expression. BBa_K1024002 is a reporter for the LuxR quorum sensing system in yeast, designed to allow engineered yeast to display mCherry fluorescence upon detection of AHL signals. We used this part to test the efficiency of AHL detection. BBa_K1024003 is a reporter for the Tet system. BBa_K1024004 and BBa_K1024005 function as AHL sensor and downstream reportor, respcetively. A protable pathogen detector yeast strain is acquired by mating an a-strain carrying BBa_K1024004 and an alpha-strain carrying BBa_K1024005.

Part Name: BBa_K1024000
Short Description: LuxR in Yeast (pTEF+VP16+NLS+LuxR)
Part Type: Regulatory
Design: We constructed and improved standard BioBrick Parts about quorum sensing systems and modified the systems in prokaryotic microorganisms for usage in S. cerevisiae (Yeast). We modified the transcription activator, LuxR (BBa_C0062), by adding nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence and Herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain in N-terminus of LuxR, and ligate the sequence of this modified LuxR downstream TEF promoter, which is the constitutive promoter in yeast (BBa_K1024000).

BBa_K1024001
Part Name: BBa_K1024001
Short Description: Lux Promoter in Yeast (pLux+Cyc Promoter+mCherry)
Part Type: Reporter
Design: We constructed and improved standard BioBrick Parts about quorum sensing systems and modified the systems in prokaryotic microorganisms for usage in S. cerevisiae (Yeast). We modified the transcriptional regulated promoter in quorum sensing system, Plux promoter (BBa_R0062), by adding cyc100 mini promoter downstream of the Plux promoter (BBa_K1024001).

BBa_K1024002
Part Name: BBa_K1024002
Short Description: Reporter for quorum sensing systems in yeast
Part Type: Signaling
Design: We constructed and improved standard BioBrick Parts about quorum sensing systems and modified the systems in prokaryotic microorganisms for usage in S. cerevisiae (Yeast). The LuxR gene is constitutively expressed, while the activation of Lux Promoter requires the signaling of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL). Therefore, mCherry is activated in the presence of AHL.
Test: Yeasts after 8 hours of enlarge cultivation were divided into two three groups, induced by DMSO (control), 0.5uM AHL and 200uM AHL separately. After 0.5, 16 and 24 hours, yeasts were collected and tested for mCherry fluorescence by flow cytometry. Total fluorescence were obtained for each group. As shown in the figure, inducing with high concentration of 200uM AHL caused significant increase of mCherry fluorescence. Low concentration of AHL also induced higher fluorescence. Among the three tested time points, the fold change of fluorescence reached the highest when 16 hours after induction.

BBa_K1024003
Part Name: BBa_K1024003
Short Description: Reporter for Tet system in Yeast
Part Type: Signaling
Design: The part is designed to valid the Tet system in yeast. TetR gene with VP16 is constitutively expressed, activating the downstream reporter gene of TetO and CYC1 TATA region. In the yeast (S. cerevisiae) the ade2, and/or the ade1, mutation in the adenine biosynthetic pathway leads to the accumulation of a cell-limited red pigment. Thus, it could be used as a marker for screening of target phenotype.
Test: Yeast with ADE2 knockout exhibits red in color. The function of the plasmid was tested by rescuing the knockout strains, which regained the white color by expressing ADE2.

BBa_K1024004
Part Name: BBa_K1024004
Short Description: Sensor yeast (inducible TetR+VP16)
Part Type: Signaling
Design: The part was the sensor of the pathogen detector. LuxR was constitutively expressed. When sensing AHL, LuxR will bind to the Lux promoter and thus activated the downstream TetR with VP16. Mated with reporter yeast (BBa_K1024005), the TetR with VP16 will bind to the Tet operator and activated the downstream gene.

BBa_K1024005
Part Name: BBa_K1024005
Short Description: Report yeast (inducible ADE2)
Part Type: Signaling
Design: The part was the reporter of the pathogen detector. Tet operator and CYC1 TATA region was followed by ADE2 gene. In the yeast S. cerevisiae the ade2, and/or the ade1, mutation in the adenine biosynthetic pathway leads to the accumulation of a cell-limited red pigment. Mated with sensor yeast (BBa_K1024004) which is induced by AHL, the ADE2 gene will be activated and rescuing the ADE2 knockout yeast by making it white.
