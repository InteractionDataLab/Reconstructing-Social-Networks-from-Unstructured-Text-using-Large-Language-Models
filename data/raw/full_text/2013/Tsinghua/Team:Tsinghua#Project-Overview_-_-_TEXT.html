Overview
In our project , we take advantage of the mating procedure of yeast to establish a switchable pathogenic microorganism detection box. One of the two haploids—alpha, is designed to play the role as pathogenic sensor, which in function can sense the AHL molecules of pathogenic microorganisms through the novel inducible eukaryotic AHL sensing system designed by our team (PPD sensor).
After sense the AHL molecules, the secondary signaling molecules – tetR is produced. The other half, a, is designed to be the reporter which when can output different detectable signals under the stimulation of tetR molecules.
Different types of sensor alpha mate with different types of reporter a, via the Tet-off system, the PPD sensor integrate with PPD reporter and output detectable signal. The work flow within the yeast after mating shows as follows:
After mating, the specific “pathogenic detector” will be transformed into dry powder, which is the nonbioactivity form of yeast and can be stored under normal condition for weeks. The test paper can be produced by stick the yeast dry powder into specific paper with growth medium and activated by water. Special biology sample can be added on to the test paper and by visible signal we can conclude if the people have infected with one type of microorganism.
