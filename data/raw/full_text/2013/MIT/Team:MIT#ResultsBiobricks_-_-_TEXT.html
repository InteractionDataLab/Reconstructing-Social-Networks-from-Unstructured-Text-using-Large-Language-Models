CMV_Acyl-TyA-eGFP MammoBlock
ID: BBa_K1179071
Type: Generator
Length: 2834
Description/Usage: This part encodes the expression of green fluorescent protein that is exported out of the cell from the addition of the acylation tag and TyA sequence that is fused to the GFP coding sequence.
hEF1a_Cas9-VP16 MammoBlock
ID: BBa_K1179002
Type: Generator
Length: 5141
Description/Usage: This part encodes the expression of the fusion protein Cas9-VP16 that is used in activating a minimal CMV promoter with guide RNA binding sites upstream.
hEF1a_eYFP-4x451 MammoBlock
ID: BBa_K1179072
Type: Generator
Length: 2085
Description/Usage: This part encodes the expression of yellow fluorescent protein and it also has four miRNA451 target sites to allow for translational repression.
