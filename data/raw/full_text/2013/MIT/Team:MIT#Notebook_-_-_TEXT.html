Notebook Overview
Our team has been working hard on our project for many months, and we are proud to share our exciting results with the iGEM community! Here we present a summary of our daily progress and experiments.  Starting in the 2013 spring semester, our team learned laboratory techniques and began experiments. Over the summer, the full 10 member team - including one undergraduate student from another university - worked full-time on the project. Currently, during the 2013 fall semester, some members of the team are continuing to invest time and conduct experiments for the project through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at MIT.
