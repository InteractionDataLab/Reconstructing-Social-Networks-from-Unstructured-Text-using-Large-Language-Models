Methods and Protocols Overview
In order to assess the functionality of exosome-mediated cell-cell communication in vivo, as well as to design and implement our various modules for our proposed genetic circuits, our team employed a variety of protocols and methods in our experimentation. The experiments that we conducted to produce our results included the generation of nucleic-acid circuitry components in E. coli bacteria, the in vitro construction and testing of components, the in vivo testing of various circuit components in HEK293 and Jurkat mammalian cells, and the use of laboratory instrumentation for data generation and analysis.
Annealing Oligos
Create 100uM stock solutions of each oligo.
Create a 20uL solution of the following: 2 uL of 100uM stock solution of top oligo, 2 uL of 100uM stock solution of complementary bottom oligo, 2 uL T4 DNA ligase buffer, 1 uL T4 poly nuclease kinase (T4PNK), 13 uL water.
Put in thermocycler and run the following program: 37°C for 30 mins, 95°C for 5 min, Ramp to 25°C by 0.1% (0.1°C per second) and keep at 25°C for 5 min, End at 4°C.
Allow to cool down to room temperature, oligos should be annealed.
Antarctic Phosphatase Treatment of Backbone
Use 5 units of Antarctic phosphatase per 1µg of DNA (over digesting by factor of X).
Calculate volumes: DNA µg = amount of DNA in backbone digest = X, Enzyme volume = X/5 uL (minimum of 1 uL), Buffer is dilution factor x dilution of the total volume.
Fill in this order: Backbone Digestion, Antarctic Phophatase Buffer, Antarctic Phosphatase.
Incubate for 15 minutes at the specified temperature for the enzyme (37C).
Heat Inactivate for 5 minutes at 65C.
Keep the buffer on ice and the antarctic phosphatase in the benchtop coolers when on the bench.

DNA Transfection of HEK293 - Lipofectamine 2000
Label enough eppendorf tubes for the number of conditions/wells you are transfecting plus one for a master mix of transfection reagent and unsupplemented DMEM. If possible, try to pool conditions/wells, i.e, if doing a small molecule induction ladder.
Aliquot 50 uL of unsupplemented DMEM to every tube. If you are pooling n conditions/wells, aliquot 50*n. For your mastermix, aliquot 50* total number of conditions/wells of unsupplemented DMEM.
Dilute plasmid DNA in tubes containing 50 (or 50*n) unsupplemented DMEM. Be sure to mix well. For our transfections, we transfect at most 500 ng of plasmid DNA. Be sure that DNA is of high purity and concentrated enough that it can be pipetted in small volumes (from .5 uL- 1 uL). Anything larger will dilute the final concentration.
Dilute transfection reagent into unsupplemented DMEM to create the mastermix. We use 1.65 uL Lipofectamine per 500 ng of plasmid DNA per well. So, if transfecting n conditions/wells, dilute 1.65 * n transfection reagent.
Add 51.65 uL of master mix per tube and pipette gently to mix.  If pooling, mix 51.65 * # of conditions pooled. Let complexes form for 20 minutes in the hood.
While complexes are forming, cells must be seeded into a 24 well plate at 100,000 cells in 500 uL. Note. If transfecting in glass bottom well plates, you must pretreat with gelatin (see menu).
Trypsinize and count confluent cells. Centrifuge at 1180 rpm for 4 minutes and resuspend in fresh media. Dilute to the 100,000 cells/ 500 uL. Add 500 uL of cells to each well.
When complexes are done forming, add dropwise to each well. Swirl the entire plate to mix, and then place into an incubator. Small molecule induction can be done 24 hrs later, and gene expression can be assayed 48 hrs later.

Gelatin Pretreatment
This protocol is for use in 24 well, glass bottom, plate format. It can be scaled up or down depending on what size dish you are using.
Find the 0.1X bottle of gelatin. It is already at the proper concentration. It is usually kept above the TC room centrifuge. Otherwise, possibly check the Cold Room if the TC room was recently cleaned.
Pipette gelatin into each well to be used of the plate such that the bottom of the well is fully coated with gelatin. For a 24 well plate, add 0.5 to 1.0 mL gelatin per well.For other plates, scale appropriately -->  glass 35 mm dishes would be at least 1.5 mL.
Swirl plate (figure eight or shake forward/side) gently to evenly spread the gelatin. (Make sure the bottom of each well is covered!)
Let gelatin set for 20 minutes. In the meantime, proceed normally with transfection protocol.
Just prior to seeding the cells, gently aspirate the gelatin from each well. (Make sure you remove all the liquid but don't scrape the bottom of the plate -- tilt the plate to make it easier)
Trypsinize the cells and put DEME to neutralize.
Centrifuge down the cells at 5000 rcf for one minute
Immediately proceed with seeding the cells and continue the rest of the transfection protocol.
Add 500ul PBS to re-suspend cells
Passaging HEK293 Cells
Note. This protocol is for culturing cells in 100mm^2 round dishes. For other culture volumes, the amounts of reagents required will be different.   Before moving cells from the incubator into the hood,
Wipe down hood with 70% EtOH.
Pre-warm reagents in a 37 °C water bath. For a full 500 mL bottle of media this can take up to 20 mins to fully warm.
Anything moving into the hood, especially from the water bath, must be washed off with 70% EtOH.
Once your hood and reagents are ready,
Move cells from incubator to hood.
Aspirate off media using a sterilized (autoclaved), glass pastuer pipette, or a disposable aspirating pipette.
Optional: Wash cells gently using 2.5 mL PBS, then aspirate.

Add 9.5 mL of supplemented media to inactivate trypsin. Pipette to get cells into a single cell suspension.
Pipette cells into a conical tube and take note of the final volume (which should be 12mL). This will dictate how much is transferred to a new cell culture dish. If splitting 1:6, then you need 2 mL of cell solution.
After transferring cells to new culture dishes, add supplemented media to a final volume of 12-13 mL.
Label dishes with Name, Date, Cell type, splitting ratio, and passage number.
Place cells into incubator.
Destroy unused cells by aspirating into the vacuum trap, or by adding bleach.
Wash out of hood with 70% EtOH, close the sash, and turn on UV Light.

Preparing Samples for Flow Cytometry
Note, this protocol is for use with 24 well plates. Trypsin volumes will need to scale according to the plate format you use.
Take well plate from the incubator.
Aspirate off the supernatant in each well. If cells have not adhered, pipette the supernatant into a conical tube.
Add 500 uL of trypsin to each well.
Incubate at 37°C for at most a minute.
Add 1 mL of supplemented media to stop the trypsinization.
Transfer cells to the appropriate conical tube.
Centrifuge for 1180 rpm for 4-5 minutes.
Apsirate supernatant carefully, not disturbing the cell pellet (it will be rather small).
Resuspend  in 1 mL of PBS, aiming for a single cell suspension. Any clumps of cells could clog the flow cytometer.
Transfer from the conical tube to the 5 mL polystyrene tube for FACS. Any other tube (such as polypropylene) will not work.
Cryopreservation and Cell Thawing
Cryopreservation
This protocol requires the use of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Before using these reagents, you should read a materials safety data sheet (MSDS) for proper handling. Also, for cryopreservation, you ideally want to preserve cells that are at a low passage number (P4 or less).
Label as many cryovials as you need (if aiming to freeze down 10*106 cells at 1*106 cells/mL, you need 10 cryovials) with the the passage number of the cells, concentration, initials, date, and cell type. Be sure to also label the caps with something to be able to pick out cryovials easily.
Prepare freezing medium by mixing unsupplemented media (DMEM) (50% v/v),  FBS (40% v/v) , and  DMSO (10% v.v)  DMSO is hygroscopic, so you must work quickly when transferring from stocks. Be sure to seal the bottle tightly.
Count cells using a hemocytometer (see menu) or an automated cell counter. Dilute cells to a concentration of 1.0*106- 1.5*106 cells/mL.
Centrifuge cells at 1180 rpm for 4-5 minutes. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in freezing media, to a single cell suspension.
While cells are in the centrifuge, be sure to check the IPA in the Mr. Frosty freezing chamber. It must be changed every 5th use. Be sure to dispose of IPA properly.
Aliquot 1 mL cells to cryovials.
Place croyvials in the Mr. Frosty chamber. Freeze at -80°C from 6-24 hrs. Then transfer to either liquid nitrogen tanks, or a -140°C freezer.
A few days later, thaw a vial to check cell viability.
Thawing Mammalian Cells
Mamallian cells must be thawed quickly for optimal viability. Since you are removing cells from the -140°C, you need to move quickly and consider extra protection such as a face shield (cryovials can explode).
Have 12 mL of media pre-aliquotted and warmed. In addition, warm the stock bottle of media.
Move media into hood.
Working quickly, retrieve cells from -140°C freezer. Slightly untwist cap, to reduce the chance of the cryovial exploding.
Carefully dip the bottom of the cryvial into the 37°C waterbath. DO NOT SUBMERGE or you will contaminate your cells.
When there is a small ice-chunk, bring cells to hood (cells will continue to thaw in transport).
Pipette cells into pre-warmed aliquot of media. Centrifige at 1180 rpm for 5 minutes.
Aspirate supernatant carefully, to not disturb the cell pellet. Resuspend in 12 mL fresh, warmed media.
Place into culture dish, and observe for confluency over the next few days, changing media after about two days. In our experience, 1-1.2*106 cells reaches confluency in 2-3 days.
Rh-PE Staining
Note. This protocol is for Rh-PE that has been suspended in ethanol.
Chill the cells down to 4 Celsius
Add 5uM final concentration of Rh-PE into each well
Continue incubating the cells at 4C for an hour.
Take out the cells and wash them three times with PBS
Resuspend the cells in colorless media
Poly-L-Lysine Coating For Microscopy
This technique is useful for preparing suspension cells (such as Jurkat T cells) for microscopy because it reduces the amount the cells move as they float in the media.
Prepare stock solution by dissolving 100mg poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in 100 ml water. Filter sterilize the solution by passing through a 0.22mm filter. Store in 5 ml aliquots at -20C.
Working solution is 50 mg/ml(1 in 20 dilution of stock)
Sterilize the surface in 95% ethanol & dry before coating.
Place the coverslips in a single layer in a sterile petri dish containing working solution & incubate for 1 hr at 37C.
Remove coverslips using sterile forceps & allow the surface to air dry.
Note: During drying allow the coverslips to stand on a slant. Otherwise they stick to the surface on which they are laid.
Fluorescent Microscopy
All fluorescent microscopy observations were carried out using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 1344 x 1024 pixel cooled ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Corporation) and a Zeiss 10X objective. False coloring was performed by capturing images with the appropriate colors and assembling them into larger mosaics using custom software (GFP filters: 470/40 excitation & 525/50 emission, DsRedExpress: 565/30 & 620/60). Cells were live-cell imaged in 24-well Tissue Culture treated plastic plates (Corning Corporation) in DMEM media with appropriate supplements as detailed in cell culture protocols.
Confocal Microscopy
All confocal microscopy observations were carried out using a Leica TCS SP5 within a 37C humidity controlled chamber supplemented with 5% CO2 and a Leica 10x objective with 3.0 zoom enabled. PMT wavelength ranges were set using default spectra for GFP, YFP, Alexa, ROX, mKate, BFP spectrums in Leica AFS Software with laser excitation as follows: GFP - 488nm, 30%; YFP - 488nm, 30%, Alexa - 488nm, 30%; ROX - 630nm, 40%, mKate - 565nm, 30%, BFP - 405nm, 12%.Cells were live-cell imaged in 24-well glass bottom plates (MatTEK Corporation) treated with 1% gelatin in DMEM media with appropriate supplements as detailed in cell culture protocols.
Flow Cytometry
All flow cytometry observations were carried out using a LSRFortessa  flow analyzers (BD Biosciences) with the following sets of setting. Alexa and GFP/YFP were measured using a 488 nm Laser, a 505 nm Longpass filter and a 530/30 emission filter in the linear range of PMT values adjusted such that negative cells fell at 102. BFP was measured with a 405 nm Laser, a 460 nm Longpass filter and a 480/40 emission filter. mKate and ROX were measured using a 561 nm laser and a 582/15 emission filter. For each sample,  cells were trypsinized according to details in cell culture protocols and approximately 1 x 104 to ~  1 x 105 cell events  were  collected. In parallel, Rainbow Calibration Particles (BD Biosciences) were measured in order to equalize the data between different instruments and settings.
