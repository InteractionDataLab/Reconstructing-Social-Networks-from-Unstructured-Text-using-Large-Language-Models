6th: We digested a lot of pSB1C3 plasmids we extracted on 4th September with XbaⅠ enzyme and SpeⅠenzyme and did agarose gel electrophoriesis to recycle carrier segment by gel extraction kit. We linked carrier segment we got on 5th with 467 double-strand segment and 516 double-strand segment by T4 DNA ligase.
7th: We transformated E.coli DH5α Competent Cells with recombined plasmids we got on 6th September and spread these cells on the surface of solid LB medium added chloromycetin.
8th: We transferred single colony of recombination plasmids-containing E.coli cells into fluid LB culture medium with chloromycetin, and shaken the medium overnight at 37℃.
9th: We extracted plasmids from the LB culture medium we shaken on 8th September and sent the recombined plasmids sample to GenScript for sequencing.
10th: 
11th: We got result of sequencing from GenScript. We constructed standardized 467-plasmid successfully.</SPAN></H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="ss-row"><DIV class="ss-left"><H2 id="October">October</H2></DIV><DIV class="ss-right"><H2>2013</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="ss-row ss-medium"><DIV class="ss-left"><H3><A>Week 1</A><SPAN>12th-19th, October</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class="ss-right"><H3><SPAN>
12th : Subcultured 293T cells to six 225 cm2  flasks and three 75 cm2  flasks .
14th：Transferred 293T cells with plasmids and microRNA.For the six 225cm2  flasks , three groups : lipo*2, mirco162 RNA*2, micro162 RNA + GP120 plasmid(targeting to T cell) *26 hours After transfecting, Changed the culture mediaSubcultured 293T cells.
15th : Soaked centrifuge tubes which will be used in ultracentrifugation over night in ddH2O
16th: Collected 36-hour~48-hour culture containing exosomes.(The cells transfected with micro162 were contaminated by bacterium). Did pre-centrifuge(1500g:10min; 10000g: 30min). Separated exosomes by ultracentrifugation. Examine protein concentration of exosomes.Subcultured 293T cells.
17th: Separated T cells from the spleen of mouse, cultured the cells in 24-well plate, Each well contained 10^5 cells. cocultured empty exosomes and mirco162+GP120 exosomes with T cell respectively, each well added 10ug exosomes.Cultured HepG2 cells to 15 wells in 96-well plate, and did 4 plates. 
18th : collected T cell in 12-well plate, separated CD4+ cells and CD4- cells using CD4+ T cell isolation Kit ,and started to extract RNA from the cells respectively, and then RT-Q-PCR.Subcultured 293T cells.HepG2 cells were contaminated by bacterium.
19th :  Analyzed data.</SPAN></H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="ss-row ss-medium"><DIV class="ss-left"><H3><A>Week 2</A><SPAN>20th-26th, October</SPAN></H3></DIV><DIV class="ss-right"><H3><SPAN>
20th :  Subcultured 293T cells
22th : transferred 293T cells with plasmids and microRNA(before transfecting, collected the medium for empty exosomes).For twelve 225 cm2  flasks, micro162 RNA*2, micro162 RNA+ GP120 plasmid *2, GFP inhibit siRNA *8;  For  twenty four 75 cm2  flasks, GFP inhibit siRNA + pres1 plasmid;cultured HepG2 cells to 15 wells in 96-well plate, and did 5 plates.
23th : Separated T cells from the spleen of mouse, cultured the cells in 24-well plate, Each well contained 3.2 *10^5 cells. (0 hours after adding exosomes into HepG2 cells) collected the medium of one plate with HepG2 cells for elisa. And Added 10ul CCK reagent and put the plate in incubator for 3hours, then tested it’s OD value. Add exosomes into HepG2 cells in each plate of the remaining four: PBS 10ul each well *5; empty exosomes 10ul(3ug) each well *5; micro162+GP120 exosomes 10ul(3ug) each well *5; Soaked centrifuge tubes which will be used in ultracentrifugation over night in ddH2O
24th : Collected 36-hour~48-hour culture containing exosomes.Cocultured empty exosomes, mirco162 exosomes and mirco162+GP120 exosomes  with T cell respectively, each well added 10ug exosomes.12 hours after adding exosomes into HepG2 cells, collected the medium for elisa. Added 10ul CCK reagent and put the plate in incubator for 3hours, then tested it’s OD value. For 24/36/48 hours after adding exosomes into HepG2 cells, did the same experiments as 0/12hours.
25th : Collected T cell in 12-well plate, separated CD4+ cells and CD4- cells using CD4+ T cell isolation Kit ,and started to extract RNA from the cells respectively, and then RT-Q-PCR.Got the OD value of 0/12/24/36/48 hours after adding exosomes in HepG2 cells. Injected three GFP mice with empty exosomes , exosomes containing GFP inhibit siRNA, and pres1-exosomes with GFP inhibit siRNA respectively twice. For the first time at 9 am and the second time at 9 pm.
26th : Analyzed data 
Killed the three GFP mice and took out their liver respectively at 9 am. 
Did a frozen section of the hepatic tissue.
Observed the slice of the tissue with the fluorescence microscope and took pictures.
Using the Human IL-6 Elisa kit, Human IL-8 Elisa kit and Human TNF-α Elisa kit to test OD450 value of the medium we collected 0/12/24/36/48 hours after adding exosomes in HepG2 cells. 
Analyzed data.</SPAN></H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></LI></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
