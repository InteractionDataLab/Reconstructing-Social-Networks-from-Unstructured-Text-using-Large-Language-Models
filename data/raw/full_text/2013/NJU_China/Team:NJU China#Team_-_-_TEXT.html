Weng Mingxi I love science and have great passion in life science. This is my first time to participate in iGEM. I find my fun in our project this summer. It's so great to design and synthesize biological devices to achieve a certain transformation of life to some extent as our will. And it’s always a pleasure to be with everyone in our team.

Xiong Aoli What synthetic biology attracts me by in the first place is that by designing different parts one’s hands could work just as the hands of god. It brings me back to the childhood when I was playing with my Lego. With several basic parts, one could build a world with infinite possibility, just like synthetic biology and iGEM. I’m enjoying the process of creating something new. Contact：452086759@qq.com
