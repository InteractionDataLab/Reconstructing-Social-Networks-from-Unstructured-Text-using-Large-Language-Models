parts
This year our team iGEM-China constructed altogether 3 parts.
For the killing module, we constructed plasmid encoding anti-HBV siRNA 467( BBa_K1180000 ) and cloned this into standardized backbone pSB1C3. The function of this part was extensively validated by us and it worked as we expected. The expression level of this plasmid in the chassis HEK 293T cells is high and it can silence the viral gene HBsAG significantly.
For the targeting module, we constructed BBa_K1180002 (brain targeting) and BBa_K1180003 (liver targeting). The function of was extensively confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo test. After its expression, the RVG peptide can lead the exosome to the brain.
