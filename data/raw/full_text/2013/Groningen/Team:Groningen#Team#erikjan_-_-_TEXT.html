Bio
Erik Jan is a second year Biomedical Engineer. Eventually his goal is to be a medical physicist.            He decided to join iGEM after he heard about it from last years team. Synthetic biology can be close to Biomedical Engineering and this was a good opportunity to get some experience. Because Biomedical Engineering in Groningen does nothing close to the field of synthetic biology. He is the chairman of the team and is busy organizing a lot of stuff, tries to keep track of everything we do, works on the wiki a lot and helps where ever he can. Besides his studies he works part-time as a teacher and loves to sail and go scuba diving.
