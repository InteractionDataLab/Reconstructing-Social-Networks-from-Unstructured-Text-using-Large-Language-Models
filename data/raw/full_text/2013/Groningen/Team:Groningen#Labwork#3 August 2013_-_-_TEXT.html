Mirjam
The plates with the transformation of Pdes/CheY are placed in the fridge.
The tubes with liquid inoculation of eYFP didn't show any color difference. After centrifugation the difference is still unvisible.
Miniprep analysis of the eYFP without IPTG and the samples of Pdes/CheY is done. A restriction analysis showed for the third time that eYFP is inserted into the genome. For Pdes/CheY no bands are seen.

On the 2x SG plate, which was dried over night at 37°C, 2µl of overnight Bacillus Subtilis culture is spotted.
The plates (plated yesterday) show colonies. A few colonies are picked and streaked out on LB + Amp + IPTG (100µM).
The plasmid (isolated by Sander) that seems to contain the desired construct is transformed in E. Coli DH5α and plated on LB + Amp + IPTG (100µM).
