Finished matlab script for approximating the optimal selection of codons in argiope aurantia by counting codon frequencies in the main body of highly expressed genes MaSp1 and MaSp2. This data was then used to approximate MaSp2 translation elongation speeds, and to select codons in Bacillus in such a way that this translation elongation speed was matched.
