Claudio
The plates pSB1C3-S16-3-5 and pSB1C3-S16-9-11 showed around thousands of colonies.
Colony PCR was performed (NEB Mater Mix) on 4 colonies per plate using VF2 and VR primers (annealing temperature 64°C).
Colony C from pSB1C3-S16-3-5 and colony D from pSB1C3-S16-9-11 were positive candidate and were inoculated in LB + Cm.
Plates (work previously done by Mirjam) containing several combination of signal sequences together with S3 or S9 showed colonies.
Colony PCR was performed (NEB Mater Mix) on 2 colonies per plate using VF2 and VR primers (annealing temperature 64°C).
The samples were checked on agarose gel 0.8% (Inne).
Colony 1A, 2A, 5A, 7A-B and 8A showed to be positive candidates and were inoculated in LB + Cm.
pSB-S1-S5-S5 and pSB-S2-S5-S5 were digested with SpeI and PstI and the product was purified.
S13 and S14 were ligated into pSB1C3-S1-S5 and pSB1C3-S2-S5, respectively.
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5α and plated on LB + Cm.

Sebas
Sequenced RFP strain form 11-09 was not the right one. So did a colony pcr on 16 other colonies still stored in the fridge.
Picked a colony stroke it in a PCR tube, than on a plate. 4/16 colonies had the right insert.
