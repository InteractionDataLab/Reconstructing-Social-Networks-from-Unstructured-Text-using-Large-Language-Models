For the plates of the motility assay only the 0.4% provided a probable result. The others were completely overgrown, the reason for this is very likely that the concentration of agar (0.2% and 0.1%) is to low for plates. The tests did show that delta cheY bacillus grows better, and more uniformly, then competent E.coli.
The hy-spank GFP e.coli plates grew colonies, 4 single colonies are picked and inoculated in the 37C shaker (overnight).
Performed a restriction digest of ms2 samples 1 till 3.
0.8% gel was loaded as following.
well 1
well 2
well 3
well 4
well 5
well 6
well 7
well 8
well 9
well 10
1kb DNA ruler
ms2 1
ms2 2
ms2 3
uncut plasmid ms2 1
1kb DNA ruler
ms2 1
ms2 2
ms2 3
uncut plasmid ms2 1
The gel was loaded in duplo because there was to much sample to fit in one well
the gel didn't show any bands except for the DNA ruler.
