Mirjam
Checked the plates with MotB+S9+S5 and FliZ+S3+S5. These plates showed only red colonies.
Made a restriction digestion of EstA, S3 and S9 with BamHI. Made a ligation between EstA and the S3 and S9 subunit.
Claudio & Sander
First we now realize that iodine kills Bacillus subtilis.
6 colonies from each Bacillus subtilis transformation plate (BBa_K1085014-BBa_K1085018 and BBa_K1085014-BBa_K1085022) were inoculated in LB + Cm and were streaked out on LB agar + Cm + starch.

Ran a 0.8% agarose gel to check the results from the colony PCR, 12 samples were tested. mixture 5uL sample + 5uL 2x loading dye. gel ran at 90 Volts for 35 minutes.
