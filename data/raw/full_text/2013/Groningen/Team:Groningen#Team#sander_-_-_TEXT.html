Sander Wallert
Role
Lab Hero
Background
Chemical Analyst, Master in Biology
Bio
General Biologist with a light specialization towards behavior and ecology. Decided to use this course to become even more of a generalist than he already was.  He also has degree in chemical analyses from a previous study, but do not ask about that, as he is still learning how to deal with that trauma.
Duty
Doing the work that other people tell him to do. Translating for agitated people. Making problems go away.
