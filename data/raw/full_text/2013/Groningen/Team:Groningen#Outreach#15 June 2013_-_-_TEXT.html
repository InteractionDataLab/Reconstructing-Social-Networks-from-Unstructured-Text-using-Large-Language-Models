Inne
Went to Indian Summer, a dance festival in Alkmaar (the Netherlands).
The festival is centred around 5 big stages which play different types of music.
In the middle of the was a big science dome, were a lot of universities and companies presented their cutting edge research. Mostly centred around sustainability. We from the RuG made bacterial paintings. This was done by taking big square petri dishes and plating bacteria on LB Agar, for the colours the following bacteria were used:

White
Bascillus subitilus

The paintings displayed various things
Many people were interested and it was a lot of fun.
