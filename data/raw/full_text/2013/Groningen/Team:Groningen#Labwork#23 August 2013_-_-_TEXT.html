Claudio
S3, S4, S9, S10 and BBa_K823023 were digested with BamHI and PstI.
S15, S16 and BBa_K823023 were digested with EcoRI and BamHI.
S7, S8, S11, S12, S13, S14 and BBa_K823023 were digested with EcoRI and PstI.
S7, S8, S11, S12, S13 and S14 were ligated in pSB1C3. The ligation product was transformed in E. Coli DH5α and plated on LB + Cm.
S3, S4, S9, S10, S15 and S16 were ligated in BBa_K823023 (the aim is to store the synthetic DNA in a plasmid). The ligation product was transformed in E. Coli DH5α and plated on LB + Amp.
Sebas
The 6 inoculated hy_spank-GFPdsm colonies grew overnight, preformed a miniprep (conc: >100ng/µl). Did a digestion check
with XbaI*PstI, expected sizes were: 759, 7544.
All plasmid purification's had the same sizes around ~750 and 7000~8000:
Sander
made a plasmid isolation of S1, S2 S5 and S6. placed in a box marked bio bricks in locations 1,2,3 and 4 respectively. also placed the submission backbone in to that box on the lowest row.
Inne
Spun down the cells that were in the incubator for 1 hour.  Resuspended in the residual liquid and plated them on cm plates.
