Participated in a two and a half hour long brainstorm session about a big exposition that the university of Groningen is holding next year, in celebration of its 400 year existence. There will be several themes for this exhibition, we were invite to join the healthy ageing brainstorm. We made sure that synthetic biology will be present in this exhibition.
