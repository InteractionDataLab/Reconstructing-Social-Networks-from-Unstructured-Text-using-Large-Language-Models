Looked into available tools to model the motility. Expectation: Modelling can be done in two steps, first pre calculate heat diffusion in closed system. This should provide a series of x,y,z values based on time. This data can then be used in modelling motility of the cells.  First idea, is to model the heat diffuse by a Lattice Boltzmann algorithm with http://www.palabos.org/.
