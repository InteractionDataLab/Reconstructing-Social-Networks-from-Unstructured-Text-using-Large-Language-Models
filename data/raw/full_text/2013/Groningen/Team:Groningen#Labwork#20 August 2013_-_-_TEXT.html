BBa_J04450 is transformed to E. Coli DH5α on LB + Cm.
This BioBrick has to aims: the part codes for an RFP, which is necessary for submitting new backbone to the registry and the backbone which must used to submit new part to the registry.
The synthetic DNA sequences are prepared for use. They are diluted in 20µl TE buffer.

The 0.7% agar plates that were to dry in the 37C incubator have dried. They were inoculated with liquid culture or from colonies on plates. The resulting in the following plates:

New plates of 0.4% and 0.3% were prepared and left to dry at the bench. This to check the effect of different concentrations agar. For this the liquid cultures of cheY and the wildtype had to be put in new medium. The OD was measured of the existing cultures and new overnight cultures were made.

Because the digestion check for the GFP didn't work new colonies were inoculated and the rest from the ligation was
transformed to E. coli (forgot heat shock at 37 degrees)
