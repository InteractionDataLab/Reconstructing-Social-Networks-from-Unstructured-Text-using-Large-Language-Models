Motility assay
Add 13 ml of the motility agar (0.4%) in every petri dish.
Inoculate the plates with the strain of interest (10 µl of overnight culture with an OD600 of 0.4).
The spot is dried for half an hour, after which the plates are inoculated at different temperatures (25°C and 37°C) for 16 hours.
After 16 hours of growth, the diameter of the colony is measured.
