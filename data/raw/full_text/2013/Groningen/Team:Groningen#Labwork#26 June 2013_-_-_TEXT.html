Did a genomic DNA extraction of B. subtilis strain 168. Two tubes are obtained from this with a concentration of 66ng/µl and 67ng/µl.
The primers for our main subject, silk secretion, arrived. The primers are diluted to a concentration of 10mM.
To run a PCR, dNTPs are necessary in a concentration of 10mM, so this dilution is also made.
A PCR reaction mix is made for the four different signal sequences.

The PCR product is loaded on gel to examine if the PCR reaction succeeded.
