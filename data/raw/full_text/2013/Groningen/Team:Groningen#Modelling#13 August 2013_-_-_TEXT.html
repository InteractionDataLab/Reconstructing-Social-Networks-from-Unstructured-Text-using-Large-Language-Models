Team:Groningen/Modelling/13 August 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Today we decided to keep track of our modelling log... because backlogging is a pain.
We finished writing up the differential equations for the chemotaxis model, and have organized our parameters.
Equations. Where; Phosphorylated CheA is AP, CheA is A, Phosphorylated CheV is VP, CheV is V, Phosphorylated CheB is BP, CheB is B, Phosphorylated CheY is YP, CheY is Y, Methylated MCP receptors are TM1, unmethylated MCP receptors are TM0, phosphorylated CheY bound to CheC compounds are YPC, YPC compounds bound to CheD are YPCD, CheD is D, CheD bound receptors are TD1, CheD free receptors are TD0, unbound  flagella is F, CheY bound Flagella is FYP, and CheC is C.
Parameters.
