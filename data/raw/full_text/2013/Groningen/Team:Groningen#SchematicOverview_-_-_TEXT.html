The spider silk gene and the Pdes (cold sensing) promoter with CheY (movement) gene downstream of it are put in our backbone, and inserted into the Bacillus subtilis genome
The transformed B. subtilis is then put in a bath with a heated implant. As the cells sense the heat close to the implant, they will stop moving
The secreted spider silk with strep-tag attaches to the implant its streptavidin coating. The coating is processed with evaporation, treated with kosmotropic ions and heated thoroughly
The implant is now coated by the Coating GEMs and is ready for use!
