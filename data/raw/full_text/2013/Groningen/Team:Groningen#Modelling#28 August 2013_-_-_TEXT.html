Team:Groningen/Modelling/28 August 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Simplified the model by decoupling CheA_P reduction due to CheB, CheV and CheY phosphorylation. Optimized subsystems seperately. Exact adaption seemed to be present to some degree, but the adaption took approximately 10 minutes, instead of the maximal 1. Furthermore, CheY_P concentrations were extremely low. Somethings still wrong.
