Only the plates transformed with the modified Munich backbone show colonies which are all white at a glance. None of the colonies grown on LB with IPTG are red.
Colony PCR is performed on 8 colonies using an annealing temperature of 55°C in order to double check the integration of the modified Munich backbone plasmid in the Bacillus Subtilis genome.
