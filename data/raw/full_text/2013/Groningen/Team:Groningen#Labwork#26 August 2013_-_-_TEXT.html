Plates (S7, S8, S11, S12, S13, S14) showed roughly hundreds of colonies per plate. One colony per plate is tested using ColonyPCR with VF2 and VR primers.
The colonies contain the right construct.
Plates (S3, S4, S9 and S10) showed 1-2 colonies per plate. One colony per plate is inoculated in LB + Amp (Sander).
Plates (S15 and S16) showed no colonies.
Inne
Poured plates to repeat the motility assay, 0.3% & 0.4% LB agar plates (20g/L LB). They are to dry overnight at the bench. The plates were made with a pipet, to ensure there is 13 ml in every plate.
