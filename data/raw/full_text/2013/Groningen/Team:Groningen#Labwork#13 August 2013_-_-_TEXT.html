Mirjam
Did a ligation reaction between Pdes and CheY.
Did a ligation reaction between Pdes-CheY, BBa_k823823 and GFP/BBa_E0030 (eYFP)
Transformation to E. coli.
Plated ΔChey and ΔDes.
Inne & Sander
The results of the motility assay were inconclusive let, so the tubes were put back in the 37C incubator.
Sebas
Grew B. sub wt, hyperspank::GFP 1&2 and induced at OD=~0,45 with 1mM IPTG. Checked T1, T2 and T3 under the
microscope, no significant differance in fluorescence was detected between the WT and the mutants, indicating
that GFP does not work in Bacillus or that the promoter does not work.
