The colony of Pdes/CheY/GFP grown yesterday in LB medium is still white, so a mini prep is done. To determine if the construct is correct, a restriction analysis is done with EcoRI and PstI, and EcoRI and XbaI. The gel shows again a band at 1100 bp, which is incorrect correlated to the respected heights (300-300-700).
Two possible reasons:
1. Pdes is not inserted into the construct
2. Due to our XbaI-SpeI overlap, CheY is removed from the construct.
Chaline
Did a restriction on Pdes.
Isolated plasmids from MS2.1/MS2.2/MS2.3 cultures. They have concentration 6.3/6.1/8.3 ng/µl.

From the agar plates that were to dry overnight, the 0.1% didn't set. The 0.2% did set but when hold side ways won't remain solid. Plates were inoculated with Bacillus delta cheY and E.coli competent cells. The bacteria are to grow overnight in the 37C incubator.
