Added 1 ul serva/100ml to the earlier made 0.8% agarose gel.
Today the PCR products of the signal sequences (FliZ, EstA, MotB and LytB) are purified using the Roche gel purification kit. Using nanodrop reveals the following concentrations:
signal sequence
concentration (ng/µl)
FliZ
9.2
LytB
8.2
MotB
8.8
EstA
8.8
Because of the low concentrations a new PCR is done using the PCR products.
A PCR is done for some different silk constructs to start with. The following combinations are made:
signal sequence - N-terminal strep tag - silk
signal sequence - silk - C-terminal strep tag
signal sequence - silk - no strep tag
silk without tag
For every sample an annealing temperature of 50°C is used, expecting a size of 900 bp.
The samples are run over a 0.8% agarose gel . This revealed that no bands are present at all. So the gel is stained with a high concentration of Ethidium Bromide and the bands appear. A big smear is seen for all the silk products, with a higher concentrated band around 200 bp. Because of this results it is decided to do a gradient PCR on the first combination from 55-75°C.
