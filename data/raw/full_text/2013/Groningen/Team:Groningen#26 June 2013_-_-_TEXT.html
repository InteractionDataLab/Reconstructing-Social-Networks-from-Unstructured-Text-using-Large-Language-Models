Extraction of the genomic DNA of B. subtilis strain 168.
Diluting the primers (to 100 mM and 10 mM)
Diluting the dNTPs to a concentration of 10 mM.
A PCR reaction mix is made containing the following compounds:
5x Buffer HF   1x
dNTPs          200 µM each
primer F       1 µM
primer R       1 µM
temp DNA       6.7 ng
phusion pol.   0.02 U/µl
MQ water is added to get the wanted volume.
Run a PCR for the four different signal sequences.
-FliZ
-MotB
-EstA
-LytB
The size will be around 100-150 bp.
The following protocol is used for the PCR of EstA, MotB and LytB:
98°C, 98°C, 50°C, 72°C, 72°C, 4°C
0:30  0:10  0:25  0:05  10:00 forever
The following protocol is used for the PCR of FliZ:
98°C, 98°C, 45°C, 72°C, 72°C, 4°C
0:30  0:10  0:25  0:04  10:00 forever
Run a 1.5% agarose gel for 13 minutes. Examination of the gel revealed that all expected products are there. The picture will follow.
