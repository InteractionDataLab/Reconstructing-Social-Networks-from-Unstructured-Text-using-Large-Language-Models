B. subtilis transformation
The Losick protocol is used
5 Day 0: Streak out the Bacillus strain of use and plate this on an LB agar plate o/n at 37°C.
Transformation (D-Day):
1. Pick up a nice big colony and drop it in 2 ml of completed MC (1x) (see sub1).
2. Grow at 37°C for 5 hours (longer if the culture is not really turbid).
3. Mix 400 µl of culture with DNA* in a fresh tube (i.e. 15 ml tubes loosely closed – aeration)
4. Grow the cells at 37°C for an additional 2 hours .
5. Spread the complete 400 µl reaction mix on selective antibiotic plates, and incubate at 37°C overnight.
(*usually 1 µl. Then 10 µl of Qiagen plasmid miniprep or <1 µl of chromosomal prep)
