Claudio
Plate containing the ligation product BBa_K1085014-S1-S5-S14 was screened again.
Colony PCR was performed (NEB Master Mix) on 16 colonies using F-spank-NheI and HM14 primers (annealing temperature 65°C).
The PCR samples were checked on agarose gel 0.8%.
One positive colony (14) was inoculated in LB + Amp.
Sander
did transformation to e.coli of BBa_K10850:16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26 and 28.
Sebas
Checked sequencing results for vector RFP #16. Results show the RFP and promoter in right position.
