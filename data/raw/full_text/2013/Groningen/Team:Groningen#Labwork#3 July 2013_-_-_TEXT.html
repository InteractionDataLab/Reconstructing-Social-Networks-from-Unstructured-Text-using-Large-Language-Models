Mirjam
Run a 0.8% agarose gel to examine the purified promoter, gel run at 100V for 22 minutes.
Mirjam and Sander
The gel examined that again dimerization of the primers happened. Therefore a new PCR run is made with the addition of DMSO. Turned out that the one with DMSO had better results. Did a gel purification (standard protocol).
Sander and Inne
Did a PCR for the silk template, in duplo. With the following protocol:
1 2 3 4 5 6
98 98 85 72 72 4
2:00 0:30 0:25 0:27 10:00 forever   So two with DMSO and two without. NB: another change is that we used 5% DMSO this time  Ran a gel which had more bigger bands them the previous pcr. The samples without DMSO were clearer than those with DMSO.
