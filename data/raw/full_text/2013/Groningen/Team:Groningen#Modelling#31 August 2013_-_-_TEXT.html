Team:Groningen/Modelling/31 August 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Optimized the VP and TM1 subsystems for exact adaption. The plots for VP and TM1 concentrations, which control the feedback, are shown below. The simulation is initiated at its equillibrium for 0 attractant. At time 0 the attractant concentration is increased to 5.8, and VP and TM1 increase to their expected equillibria for this concentration, which should be sufficient to compensate for the increased receptor activity provided by the attractant.
The TD0 system is still problematic as its error during the optimization doesnt approach zero. We may try and further simplify the system.
