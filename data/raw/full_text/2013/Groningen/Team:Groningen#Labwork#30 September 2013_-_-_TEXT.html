The CheC plate does not show any colonies. So this time 5 transformations to B.subtilisΔCheYΔDes are made.
Both plates of Pdes-CheY in BBa_k823023 do show colonies as well as the plate with Pdes-CheY-GFPdsm. A colony PCR is done on four colonies of each plate and the colonies are inoculated in LB medium.
The plates with ΔCheY and ΔDes show colonies, whereas the plates with the wildtype on the antibiotic plates do not. One colony of each plate is inoculated in LB medium to make a new -80°C stock.
