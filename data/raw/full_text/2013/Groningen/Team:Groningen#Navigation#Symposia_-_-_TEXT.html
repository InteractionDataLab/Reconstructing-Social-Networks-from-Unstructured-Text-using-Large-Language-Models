GBB Symposium
On the 6th of september the annual Groningen Biomolecular Science and Biotechnology symposium was organized at the Hamilton hotel in Groningen. During this event, many speakers were invited to present their work. As a special, we were invited to talk about our project. The GBB takes pride in the yearly success of the University of Groningen in the iGEM competition. For us, this symposium was an opportunity to practice our presentation on the way to Lyon. This was a success, we were able to see whether we could communicate our message well to a professional audience. The feedback was positive and useful, allowing for further progress.
