Team:Groningen/Modelling/19 August 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Today we debugged the simulation in MATLAB; there was an error in the Runga Kutta method, and one of the formulas was entered incorrectly. Furthermore, the method for using TM0, CheV_P and TD0 concentrations and parameters p1-p8 for calculating the k5 parameter did not scale properly and must be revised.
