Bio
Chaline is a second year physicist, she wants to do biophysics so this is a good opportunity for her to   learn more about biology. Besides  that she was tired off learning out of books and wanted to more  than that, so she joined our iGEM team. For iGEM she makes the decisions about the design  and helps   with the lab work. Studying is not the only thing she does, she also loves to do sports especially artistic   gymnastics.
