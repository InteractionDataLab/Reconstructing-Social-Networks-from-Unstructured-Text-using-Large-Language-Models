Bio:
I don't who you are or what you want, if you want ransom I can tell you I have no money.
What I do have however is a very particular set of skills, skills that make me a night mare for people like you.
If you return my daughter now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.
But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will PCR you.
