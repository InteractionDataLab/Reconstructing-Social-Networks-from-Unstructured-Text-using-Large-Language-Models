Plates containing pSB1C3-S1-S5-S5-S13 and pSB1C3-S2-S5-S5-S14 showed thousands of colonies.
Colony PCR (NEB Master Mix) was performed on 4 colonies per plate using VF2 and VR primers (annealing temperature 65°C).
The samples were checked on agarose gel 0.8%.
Colony C from pSB1C3-S1-S5-S5-S13 and colony A from pSB1C3-S2-S5-S5-S14 showed to be positive candidates and were inoculated in LB + Cm.
Plates containing pSB1C3-S16-S3-S5-S13 and pSB1C3-S16-S9-S11-S14 showed thousands of colonies.
Colony PCR (NEB Master Mix) was performed on 4 colonies per plate using VF2 and VR primers (annealing temperature 65°C).
The samples were checked on agarose gel 0.8%.
The gel didn't run well, however, one colony per plate was inoculated in LB + Cm for further screening.
Sebas
All four colonies were red on plate.
Inoculated 1 colony (#16) twice in 3ml LB/amp.
