Backbone
An amyE locus integration backbone
To transform B. subtilis with our developed silk biobricks we have improved the amyE integrational backbone from Munich's iGEM team 2012 ( BBa_K823023 ) that had no inducible promoter. We have added the HyperSpank IPTG inducible promoter from Rudner's Lab 2004. This promoter is placed right in front of the prefix, so any biobrick can be inserted in this backbone (fig 2) ( BBa_K1085014 ) and can be induced with IPTG.
In figure 1 a close-up of the promoter is shown.
The HyperSpank promoter has a single nucleotide change (G->T) at the -1 position. This increases the expression levels but also causes leaky expression when IPTG is absent [1]. To improve repression, a second lacO operator site has been inserted 71 bp upstream of the first (David Rudner, Harvard Medical School).
Figure 1: The HyperSpank promoter with in orange the lacO operators, in red the -35, -10, +1 signals and in green the prefix.
Figure 2: BBa_K1085014 with: The amp gene for ampicillin resistance in E. coli (not shown); The cat gene for chloramphenicol resistance in B. subtilis; The HyperSpank promoter with its repressor lacI; The amyE up- and downstream fragments for intergration in the amyE locus.
