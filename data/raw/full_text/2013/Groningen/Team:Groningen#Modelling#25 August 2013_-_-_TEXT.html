Team:Groningen/Modelling/25 August 2013
From 2013.igem.org
Found out that there is no solution for our current setup. The negative feedback is incapable of fully compensating for the increase in activity caused by stimulatory ligands. This could perhaps be overcome by coupling the rate coefficients of the negative feedback systems with the concentration of receptors bound by stimulatory ligands, which is currently also the case for the CheA phosphorylation rate k5.
