Mirjam
Made a PCR with (1) no strep tag (2) strep F (3) strep R. The annealing temperature for (1) and (2) is 78 degrees Celsius. For (3) the annealing temperature is 80 degrees Celsius.   Gel purification of the strep F silk obtained yesterday.
Run a 0.8% agarose gel for 30 min at 90V.  Made a gel for the PCR products. Four out of six revealed bands at the expected height.   Made a new ligation between digested munchen backbone and the LacI promoter.  Check of the restriction and ligation of the signal sequences and the silk. No bands appeared on gel.
Chaline
Gel purification of the silk PCR products.
Chaline and Mirjam
Run a gel with the ligation product and the purified silk fragments.
Silk is present for all three kinds, although in a low concentration.
