Dundee iGEM Team would like to thank everyone for their contributions small and large.
A number of groups and individuals aided us over the course of our project and we would like to express our thanks.
First and foremost, we are indebted to our advisors and supervisors for their roles in the project. Prof. Tracy Palmer, Prof. Frank Sargent and Dr Fordyce Davidson tirelessly supervised and guided the team, helping us to realise our goals. These supervisors organised the team, attained funding partnerships and gave the team an environment in which ideas were allowed to grow and flourish. The support and encouragement offered by these individuals was a catalyst for progress and we cannot thank them enough for this.
Our advisors (Richard Owen, Lucia Licandro, Ciaran Kelly and Grant Buchanan) were our primary source of advice in terms of our project timetable, sources of errors and for iGEM in general. Having taken part in iGEM in 2011, Richard and Lucia were able to relate to the team and provide critical feedback on the best uses of our time and what we should focus on. Ciaran Kelly, an advisor for the Dundee iGEM team in 2011, was able to provide much needed feedback from a more external perspective. Grant Buchanan aided the wet team in many respects from offering the use of reagents and providing guidance on their work to sharing anecdotes and wisdom.
Furthermore, we would like to thank the Division of Molecular Microbiology (MMB) at the University of Dundee. This division hosted this year’s iGEM team, providing lab and working space for the duration of the project along-side the use of research grade equipment for the project. The welcoming and approachable nature of the researchers within the division meant that the team felt at ease from day one. The considerable experience and knowledge of these researchers was an invaluable resource which the team came to depend upon and greatly appreciate. Not to mention the patience and understanding with which members of the department dealt with mistakes and errors on the part of the team.
We would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to ALL of the members of the MMB for their support over the summer.
Special thanks to:
Jacqueline Heilbronn
