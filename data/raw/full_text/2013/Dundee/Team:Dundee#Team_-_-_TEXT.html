Meet the Team - Making science happen since 1990 Go Wild
Craig Johnston
Field: Mathematics
Role: Mathematical modelling
If you could be anything what would you be?
A transformer so I can be anything I want to be..
Kyle Harrison
Field: Applied Computing
Role: Software Development / Design
If you could be anything what would you be?
A toaster because everyone likes toast.
Rachel Findlay
Field: Mathematical Biology
Role: Mathematical Modelling
If you could be anything what would you be?
An Axolotl so I can regenerate my own limbs and live underwater.
Nasir Ahmad
Field: Physics
Role: Hardware Designer /  Modelling
If you could be anything what would you be? :
Thunder in the middle of a rainstorm because it’s absolutely lovely
Ewa Grabowiecka
Field: Microbiology
Role: Biological Mop
If you could be anything?
Grumpy Cat. I would inherit a great deal of charisma, the ability to sleep forever and fabulous fur; Yet people would still find me adorable and I would become an internet sensation without even doing anything.
Philip Rodger
Field: Molecular Biology
Role: Microcystin Detector
If you could be anything what would you be?
I want to be a sloth because they live the simple life.
John Allan
Field: Microbiology
Role:Biological Mopper
If you could be anything what would you be?
Tony Stark, he’s got it all – the brains, the cash and the charm.
Alice Rowan
Field: Biomedical Sciences
Role: Biological Mop
If you could be anything?
I'd be a dream, as I would be real but also surreal. There'd be no restrictions on what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go and time wouldn't simply tick away ...it could be quickened, slowed or even reversed!
Chris Earl
Field: Molecular Biology
Role: Microcystin Sensor
If you could be anything ?
I would like to be an E.coli cell. Probably a pathogenic strain so I could infect people I don’t like. The main reason for this choice is so that this curse of consciousness that I have been enduring for the last 22 years will be over.
Kyle Buchan
Field: Microbiology
Role:Biological mopper
If you could be anything what would you be?
I'd like to be Morgan Freeman. Because...I'd be Morgan Freeman! What's not to like?
Supervisors
Prof Tracy Palmer
Field: Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology (High Heid Yin)
If you could be anything what would you be? :
A lizard. It gets to laze around in the sun all day and do nothing.
Prof Frank Sargent
Field: Professor of Bacterial Physiology (High Heid Yin)
If you could be anything what would you be?
I’d be an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas. Uh-huh. Thank you very much. No reason.
Dr Fordyce Davidson
Field: Mathematics
If you could be anything what would you be?
I would be me, as I have practiced at that for while now and don't mess things up as much as I used to. Being something else would mean starting again. Imagine trying to be a wasp! - complicated with all that aggression and stinging to learn...
Grant Buchanan
Field: Postdoctoral Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be? :
Rock guitar session musician, so could enjoy the music, meeting my heroes, playing with them but without the hassle of walking down the street being recognised. Not forgetting female groupies, of course!!
Advisors
Lucia Licandro Lado
Field: PhD Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be?
A tardigrade, to be able to survive in the vaccum of outer space.
Richard Owens
Field: PhD Molecular Microbiology
If you could be anything what would you be?
A travelling, Swedish themed magician, so I could head a show called ABBAcadabra.
