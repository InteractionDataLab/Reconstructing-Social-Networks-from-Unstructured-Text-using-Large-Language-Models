Production & Export
The ToxiMop is an engineered E. coli bacterium that expresses PP1 and can be used as a molecular mop to remove microcystin from contaminated water. Central to successfully engineering this machine was to better understand  PP1 production and export with in the cell.  Considering the export of PP1 was crucial as we  hypothesised that  microcystin  binding would predominantly take place in the periplasm.
We explored both the Twin Arginine Translocase (Tat) and General Secretory (Sec) pathways as potential export routes for PP1. However, initial Western blot results indicated that PP1 was exported into the periplasm much more successfully via the Tat pathway than via Sec. Therefore, production and export based on Tat transport, was selected as a modelling focus to allow us to optimise the construction of our prototype ToxiMop.
Building a Model for Tat Transport
The Tat machinery is a biological pathway that transports folded proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm. It consists of three small membrane proteins; TatA, TatB and TatC.
TatB and TatC together form a TatB-C complex. The protein destined for transport has a signal sequence at its N-terminus which is recognised by and binds to the TatB-C complex. This positions the protein ready for export. TatA proteins then polymerise and form a ring structure surrounding the protein allowing it to penetrate the membrane and pass into the periplasm. The signal peptide is cleaved off and this frees up the TatB-C complex and TatA proteins for further transport.
Figure 1: Processes involved in Tat transport.
Tat-dependent Transport of PP1
PP1 has a molecular mass of 37kDa. Reasonably assuming that PP1 is spherical, it would require 20 TatA proteins to form a ring large enough to accommodate it and enable it to penetrate the membrane [1]. We define this structure as a TatA assembly.
For transport, PP1 in the cytoplasm (PP1cyto) binds to TatB-C, forming a PP1 TatB-C complex (PP1B-C). The TatA assembly then surrounds the PP1 TatB-C complex. We define this product as PP1export. PP1export is then exported into the periplasm (PP1peri), releasing the TatA assembly and TatB-C back into the membrane to assist in further rounds of transport.
We  make the  following further assumptions:
TatA assemblies are pre-formed from TatA proteins
PP1 exported to the periplasm remains in the periplasm
All other processes are reversible

Hence we have the following  framework for Tat transport of PP1:
Production
Before  transport,  PP1 first needed  to be  produced. This involved inserting the PP1-encoding gene into a plasmid vector and transforming the plasmid into host cells. These cells then expressed the gene.
We now consider the transcription and translation required for this gene expression. This simple production scheme is derived by assuming that both mRNA and protein can degrade. Due to the heterologous nature of PP1, its degradation constant is particular significant.
Using the law of mass action and appropriate rate constants, we created a mathematical system that represents each reaction. Rate reaction  values and equations are shown below:

Our team developed a series of MATLAB programs to solve the models discussed here. The code for these programs along with further analysis is available at the repository [4]. The program v1_odes_solver_PP1Production solves this system numerically.
Our  model predicts that,  in  steady state, the cytoplasm of each E. coli chassis would  contain approximately 1200 PP1 molecules. This gives a crude  indication of how many cells would be  required to mop up given quantities  of microcystin. We used this information to examine the practicality of our ToxiMop. For example, if we assume that  all the PP1 is exported to the periplasm and exploit the one-to-one binding of microcystin with PP1, then  the model predicts that 0.6g of cells are required to clean up one litre of contaminated water that is classified as unsafe by World Health Organisation (WHO) regulations.  We note that the production of this  mass of cells was  easily achievable by our  Wet Team.

Deterministic Model
To solve the system of ODEs (5),  we applied the appropriate initial conditions. The only non-zero initial conditions are the number of TatB-C complexes and TatA proteins. It is known that there are approximately 15 TatB-C complexes and 600 TatA proteins in a normal E. coli cell [5]. Hence, in  our model we use 15 TatB-C complexes and 30 TatA assemblies.
The program v1_odes_solver_PP1_TatProduction_export solves this system.  The deterministic model predicted that after approximately one cell generation time only around  200 PP1 molecules had been exported to the periplasm. This was  much less than we anticipated, given the high levels of cytoplasmic PP1 computed above. Indeed, based on these figures,   up to 3.3g of cells would be required  to clean up one litre of contaminated water as defined by WHO regulations.

Figure 6: Number of PP1 molecules  in the cytoplasm and in the periplasm  (after one cell generation time  1164  and 202, respectively).
Stochastic Model
In order to check whether these deterministic results were reasonable, we next considered a stochastic modelling approach. Some of the components in the ODE model above are in low abundance.  To examine whether low copy number had a significant effect on either  PP1 production or export  numbers, we formulated and analysed a stochastic model.
The stochastic model, although better  representing the random nature associated with such  biochemical processes, did not produce significantly different results. Instead the model showed that because high and low fluctuations cancel each other out, the deterministic solutions were a good approximation of the stochastic means for  PP1cyto and PP1peri.

Model predicts failure of basic mop
As discussed above, the model predicts that 3.3g of  the basic mop  cells would be required  to clean up one litre of contaminated water as defined by WHO regulations. This equates to an impractically  large quantity. However,  the Wet Team started testing the ToxiMop with these basic cells, to test for proof of principle. Their initial experiment involved taking 20 µl from a 100 µg/ml microcystin solution and mixing it into a beaker with 200ml of TBS. 1g of ToxiMop cells was then added to the solution in a dialysis bag. Early results indicated that the ToxiMop was ineffective in mopping up the microcystin. Using the mathematical models introduced above,  the dry team tried to get  better understanding of why the mop was proving ineffective.
As detailed in (6), the model predicted that 5.75g of cells would be required to clean up the toxin present in the experimental sample.  Hence the 1g of cells used was vastly  insufficient.  We recommended the use of 5.75g of cells in a repetition of the same experiment. However, this was viewed  as being unpractical and hence the Team decided to pursue ways of improving the efficiency of the mop.
Increasing Tat Machinery
We next used our model to  investigate how   PP1  export could be enhanced. Our first thought was that this could be achieved by increasing the amount of Tat machinery per cell as the existing   model predicted that  in steady state, a significant proportion of the  PP1 molecules were retained within  the cytoplasm and thus could  not  assist in the binding of microsystin. By increasing the Tat machinery,  we hypothesised that  augmented transport from this bank of proteins to  periplasm would have the desired effect. Experimentally, this  increase could be achieved by inserting selected genes into a plasmid with a copy number of 20. This would allow us to obtain 20 extra copies of the selected Tat machinery proteins. Therefore our cells could theoretically produce 20 times the quantity of  targeted proteins. The modelling options we considered were; increasing all of the Tat components,  increasing TatA assemblies and increasing TatB-C complexes.
The simulations below show the  effect of increasing the machinery above the default level  (30 TatA assemblies & 15 TatB-C complexes) to 20 times these values.
Increasing TatA & TatB-C Complexes

Figure 12: PP1peri Stochastic means for the corresponding TatB-C Complex-TatA Assembly combinations [11]
Increasing both the number of TatA assemblies and TatB-C complexes increases the number of PP1 in the periplasm by a factor of almost twenty.
Increasing TatA Assemblies Only

Figure 15: Change in number of PP1peri with increasing number of  TatA Assemblies [9]
Figure 16: Mass of Cells required for ToxiMop experiment based on the number of TatA Assemblies [9]
Increasing the number of TatA assemblies, marginally increases the number of PP1 being exported over that for the wild type. With such a small increase, the mass of cells required for our ToxiMop experiment remains fairly high. Therefore, we could not recommend this action.
Increasing TatB-C Complexes Only
Figure 17: PP1cyto Stochastic means for the corresponding number of TatB-C Complexes [10]
Figure 18: PP1peri Stochastic means for the corresponding number of TatB-C Complexes [10]
Figure 19: Change in number of PP1peri with increasing TatB-C Complexes [10]
Figure 20: Mass of cells required for ToxiMop experiment based on the number of TatB-C Complexes [10]
As shown in the figures above, increasing the number of TatB-C complexes, predicts an 18-fold increase in the  number of  PP1  molecules exported into the periplasm. This change is sufficient  to  significantly improve  the efficiency of our ToxiMop cells - with such an increase, the mass of cells required for clean-up is reduced  by a factor of eighteen.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the model predicted that by over-expressing the Tat machinery in a realistic manner, periplasmic PP1 levels could potentially be increased almost 20-fold. Moreover, further simulations revealed that almost all of this fold increase was controlled by TatB-C over-exression. Increasing TatA assemblies alone  provided only  a marginal fold increase in PP1 export. In contrast, the model predicted that over-expression of the TatB-C complex was responsible for almost all of the 20-fold increase produced. Therefore, and taking into account  stress-induced problems likely to be  related to multiple enhancements, we  suggested to  the Wet Team that the most  efficient and effective option for mop improvement would  be to over-express TatB-C.
