Collaborations
A focus of our work over the summer was to utilise our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community. We achieved this by providing help to as many iGEM teams as possible.
This help largely consisted of the provision of bacterial strains which the respective teams required in order to realise their project. To ensure a safe transport of any samples, we had our lab mascot Jessie (Giraffe) bless the containers before they were sent off!
Munich
Provision of the PP1-encoding gene in pSB1C3 for using in their Physco filter project.

Norwich
A Dundonian soil sample was sent off to test for antimycin-producing streptomycetes!

Westminster
We sent Serratia marcescens bacterial strains that secrete chitinases, together with some plasmids for overexpressing chitinases – Project Hit Bug

Zhejiang University, China
We are currently in the process of adapting our visualisation tool to describe their protein scaffold in their bacterial ghost
