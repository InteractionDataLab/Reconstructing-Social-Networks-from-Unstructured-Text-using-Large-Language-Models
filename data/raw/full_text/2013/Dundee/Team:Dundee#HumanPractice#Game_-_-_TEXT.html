The ToxiMop Game
Presenting, the ToxiMop flash game! This was made for us over the course of a few weeks by a group of five undergraduate students from the University of Abertay, Dundee. They go by the name “Digital Janitors” and are made up of two computer artists and three programmers. We’d like to thank them for devoting their time and energy into the game, as they treated it as a summer project to help us out!
The aim of the game is simple: you are a PP1-expressing E. coli cell, under attack from evil toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa cyanobacteria!
Mop up their troublesome toxic action by firing PP1 and converting them into harmless cyanobacteria, increasing your multiplier for each mopped cell that reaches the centre of the petri dish. Increase your firing speed by picking up the small arrows that enemies drop, increasing your mopping power! Watch out though! Every evil cyanobacteria that reaches the centre of the dish will destroy your multiplier and take away one of your three lives. Lose all three and its game over!
Digital Janitors and the Dundee iGEM team would like to point out that the ToxiMop doesn’t literally fire PP1 to mop up microcystin, the ToxiMop works more like an actual mop! For precise details check out the mop section of our Wiki!
