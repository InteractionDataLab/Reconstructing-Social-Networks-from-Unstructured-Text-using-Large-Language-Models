Lab Overview
The Dundee iGEM team consisted of two teams: the wet lab and the dry lab. The wet team was responsible for all of the experimental lab work as the team comprised of three microbiologists, two molecular biologists and a biomedical scientist. There were four members of the dry team from different disciplines: a mathematical biologist, a mathematician, a physicist and a software developer.
Working in different locations meant that we had to be efficient in communicating with one another. We held weekly meetings every Friday afternoon to present data and progress from the previous week.
From experimental data the wet team were able to provide the dry team with concentrations of PP1 in E. coli cells and how effective the bacteria mops were so that they could compare the figures to their models.
The dry team helped the wet team by creating a Matlab program for calculating molar concentrations and series dilutions of chemicals. Their mathematical models were also able to provide predictive information to allow the wet team to know what step to take next with their lab work.
This communication between the teams, and how they worked parallel to each other, led to efficient teamwork throughout the project.
Created for iGEM 2013 Dundee. Based upon Bootstrap and JQuery . Design by Kyle Harrison .
