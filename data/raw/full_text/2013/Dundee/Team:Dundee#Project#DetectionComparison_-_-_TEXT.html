Detection Time
The  direct  method for detecting microcystin in water samples is high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This  process takes approximately 24 hours and is expensive due to the equipment required.  For this reason, the current method for regulating toxic microcystin levels in Scotland uses the indirect approach of cyanobacterial cell counts. However, this  process takes even longer. Using our biological detector we hope to reduce the time and cost of microcystin detection.
First, we considered  the effect that a 24 hr detection time could  have on the numbers of cyanobacteria and microcystin level  found in a water body.  This then allowed us to determine whether faster detection methods are necessary.
Theory
Making the following assumptions:
t = 0 is the time water samples are taken
b0 is the initial number of cyanobacteria at t=0
t is the time in hours after the water samples are taken
cyanobacteria undergo binary fission every hour
cyanobacteria growth is uninhibited
each cyanobacteria releases N microcystin molecules
We arrive at these equations:
where b(t) is the number of cyanobacteria at time t and MC(t) the number of microcystin molecules.
Since earliest result could  be obtained via  HPLC  in 24 hours after the water samples are taken i.e. t=24, we compared this against our aim of a 1 hour detection time t=1 by evaluating equation (2).
Dividing MC(24) by MC(1) we recover an expression for MC(24) in terms of MC(1).
Results
At the detection times, t = 24 hours and t = 1 hour, the ratio for the number of microcystin molecules is 8.4 million : 1.
Than is,  after 24 hours there can be up to 8.4 million times more microcystin molecules present than there is after 1 hour. Putting this ratio into perspective, this is the same as the height of the Empire State Building being compared to  the combined height of 7 E. coli.
Therefore, in the time period between collection of samples and obtaining results there could potentially  be  a vast increase in the concentration of microcystin present in the water body. This emphasises that HPLC, or even slower alternatives,  are  less than optimal   for toxin detection and that  early detection would provide a huge advantage.
Conclusion
We  conclude that faster detection methods are useful and our biological detector is worthwhile pursuing if we can reduce this detection time.
