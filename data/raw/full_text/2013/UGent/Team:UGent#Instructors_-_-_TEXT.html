An iGEM team would be nothing without instructors
Prof. dr. ir. Marjan De Mey : She is our team captain. She totally agrees with this quote: 'Manipulating microorganisms makes great fun. Manufacturing with them is just rewarding. Making people to work on that is the aim.' (Brick by Brick)
Charlotte Verniers: In her free time she likes to relax. This can be by cooking, skiing, running, swimming or travelling... As long as her penguin Jozef is near her.
ir. Pieter Coussement : Enthousiastic in work as well as in sport, Pieter is always in for some games. Travelling is another hobby as he likes his Indian tikka masalas and Mexican tequilas of this world freshly made. Cause he’s Mr. Brightside!
ir. Frederik De Bruyn: Frederik likes travelling, especially to the Balkan and former Sovjet Republics. He is always in for a good story or discussion, a (birding) trip into nature or a drink 3.14-style. Work hard, play hard!
ir. Gert Peters: Gert likes basketball, soccer, good food and having fun. Life is no nintendo game!
