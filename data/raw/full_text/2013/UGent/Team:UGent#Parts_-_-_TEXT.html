New part
<groupparts>iGEM013 UGent</groupparts>
lacIq-T7ccdB
This part contains a ccdB gene under control of a T7 promoter. CcdB is a bacterial toxin that interferes with topoisomerase unit GyrA. The toxin CcdB can be neutralized by its antitoxin CcdA. The T7 promoter allows for the controlled expression of CcdB. The inducible promoter is a combination of an operator LacO and a T7 promoter. The operator may be switched on or off. This, in turn, controls the transcription of the gene. The repressors (LacI and LacIq), inhibit the transcription by binding with a regulatory element, called the operator LacO. LacIq binds the operator LacO more tightly than LacI.

This part ( BBa_K1105000 ) comes from p10-LacIq-T7ccdB, a plasmid constructed by the lab Inbio-UGent. Originally, it comes from strains which are mini F-plasmid positive, such as E. coli F+.
