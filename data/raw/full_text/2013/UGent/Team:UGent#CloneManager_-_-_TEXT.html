Attributions
To perform in silico analysis, we used Clone Manager. All plasmids were first implemented into the software, and then used to help with cloning simulation, restriction, PCR etc.
Plasmid containing construct for chromosomal evolution
pTGD ccdA Pmb1 BCD7 GFP CmFRT
This plasmid contains the ccdA antitoxin and the reporter gene gfp. The homologous regions are necessary to perform Chemically Inducible Chromosomal evolution (CIChE) . If wanted, the removal of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette between the FTR sites can be done using the method of Datsenko & Wanner [PNAS 2000] .
Plasmids containing toxin ccdB
All of these plasmids are constructed using BioBrick standard parts: the plasmid backbones pSB3T5, pSB4A5 and pSB6A1. The ccdB gene that encodes the toxin is controlled by a T7 promoter.
