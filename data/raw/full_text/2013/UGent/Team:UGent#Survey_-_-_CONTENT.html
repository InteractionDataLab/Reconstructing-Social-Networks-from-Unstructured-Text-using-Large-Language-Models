This summer school was mainly oriented towards PhD students working in the field. Part of the programme was a debate about the future of biobased economy. We too attended the debate and saw this as a great opportunity to hand out a survey and our flyer to the participants to get to know how scientists active in biotechnological sciences think about certain aspects related to synthetic biology.</P><P>Curator of the debate was Prof. Willy Verstraete, a specialist in the field of microbiology. We also asked him to fill in our questionnaire. He remarked that he thinks THE big event in synthetic biology is the assembling of microbes adjusted to each other, i.e. the assembling of ‘microbiomes’.</P><P>About half of the 31 respondents is active in synthetic biology, systems biology or molecular biology research. Half of the respondents is PhD student. We asked them following questions, some of them were multiple choice while others were open questions.

</A></P><DIV class="toggle_container" style="width: 100%; clear: left;"><DIV class="block" style="width: 95%;"><P>Some approached this open question in a scientific way, whereas others approached it in a societal way. According to most respondents (not all) synthetic biology will know a lot of improvements and breakthroughs during the next years. But also changes in society will occur, for example someone answered synthetic biology will lead to more governmental employees while another thinks there will be more and more resistance in Europe to exploit synthetic biology. We think the latter will indeed be the case if nothing is done as prevention for this to occur. It is clear from plant GMOs that once a negative public opinion is present it is hard to turn this around. Therefore in synthetic biology one should make sure the positive public opinion is already present before the negative influences come in. This, however, is far more easily said than done.

Do you ever dwell on the use of antibiotic resistance genes during your research? 
</A></P><DIV class="toggle_container" style="width: 100%; clear: left;"><DIV class="block" style="width: 95%;"><P><B>One third</B> of respondents said they <B>never</B> do. We asked this question because it relates to our own project. We ourselves are convinced that the use of antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics in scientific research is not the perfect way to go. The possibility of spreading the antibiotic resistance can never be entirely ruled out. Furthermore when the used antibiotics themselves are released into the environment, development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be accelerated. Given the already ruling difficulties and problems with antibiotic resistance in the environment we think this should be avoided as much as possible.

 Have you ever felt pressured to produce results to the extent that you were tempted to omit or falsify results of your research?
</A></P><DIV class="toggle_container" style="width: 100%; clear: left;"><DIV class="block" style="width: 95%;"><P align="justify">

Three respondents answered that they did ever feel pressured to this extent. One other respondent remarked that he/she did only for subjective thresholds, e.g. for lag phase thresholds. On a total of 31 respondents this is not negligible.
Lately cases were in the media of scientists “caught” on the manipulation or falsification of results in their research project. Publication pressure for scientists is not a good case for science itself if it causes false results to be published.  This will probably keep being discussed in the future, especially if more of these cases become known.
