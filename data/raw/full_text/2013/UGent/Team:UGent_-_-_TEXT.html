A new model for chromosomal evolution: Eliminating antibiotic resistance.
Welcome to the wiki page of 2013's UGent iGEM team. This summer we will attempt to improve an existing technique, called CIChE, that raises the yield of production of biochemical products using micro- organisms as production hosts. We will eliminate CIChE's need for antibiotic resistance genes by implementing a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system.
We believe that with our adaptation CIChE may become a very valuable technique; useful in everyday industrial biotechnology and in a myriad of applications in synthetic biology.
Explore this wiki to find out more about our project and other activities during our iGEM summer!
