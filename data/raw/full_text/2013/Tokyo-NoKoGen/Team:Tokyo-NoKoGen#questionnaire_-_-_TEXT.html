Questionnaire on synthetic biology
We would like to thank all the people who helped us answer the questionnaire, we were able to get 85 replies by 2 p.m. on 27th of September. We prepared 21 questions to find out how people recognize synthetic biology.
Q1. Are you a male or a female?

Unfortunately, the ratio of generations is biased. This means that this questionnaire tend to reflect younger people's opinion.
Q3. Are you specialized in science or non-science?
文系か理系、どちらがお得意かお答えください
Most of people are major in science.
Q4. Do you know synthetic biology?
「合成生物学」を知っていますか？
Even though many people who involved in this questionnaire are major in science, it seems that the word "Synthetic biology" is unfamiliar.
Q5. If yes, how did you get to know about it?
「はい」と答えた方はどこで知りましたか？
Most of people who know Synthetic biology get the information about synthetic biology from their friends .
Q6. What do you think Synthetic biology is about?
合成生物学は次のうちどのような学問だと思いますか？
When people are asked “what do you think Synthetic biology is about?”, most of people have right recognition about synthetic biology.
Q7. Do you know iGEM?
iGEMという大会を知っていますか？
About 60% of people don’t know iGEM.
Q8. If yes, how do you know it?
「はい」と答えた方はどこで知りましたか？
Most of people who know iGEM, they knew the iGEM from their friend as well as Q5. So, people who know synthetic biology probably know iGEM.
