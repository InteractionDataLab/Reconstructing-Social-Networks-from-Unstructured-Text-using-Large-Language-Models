The oscillating network was built by using three transcriptional repressor systems in which the first repressor protein suppresses the expression of second repressor gene, whose protein suppresses the transcription of the third gene, and the protein the third gene code suppresses the first gene expression.
</P><FONT size="6"><STRONG>Hummer headed ribozyme</STRONG></FONT><P style="line-height:110%">
Hummerheaded ribozymes (HHRs) are found in many species and known to have a capability to self-cleave. Recently, engineered HHRs responding to trans-acting RNAs (taRNAs) in <I>E.coli</I> were reported. In absence of taRNA, the HHRs can self-cleave, but in presence of taRNA, their capability of self-cleavage is inhibited due to hybridize with taRNA and change their structures.
</P><P style="line-height:110%">
We developed the new oscillator system that is composed only RNAs not using repressor gene and protein. We created three taRNA connected hummerheaded ribozymes (HHR-taRNA) that sense to another taRNA. The same way as the protein oscillator, three HHR-taRNAs inhibits other one’s self-cleavage such as three-way standoff. When the first HHR-taRNA is self-cleaved, connected the first taRNA that binds to the second HHR-taRNA is free and suppresses the second HHR-taRNA self-cleavage. When second HHR-taRNA is self-cleaved, the second taRNA that binds to the third HHR-taRNA is free and suppresses the third HHR-taRNA. Finally, when third HHR-taRNA is self-cleaved, the third taRNA that binds to the first HHR-taRNA is free and suppresses the first HHR-taRNA, completing cycle.

Construction of Three of orthogonal taRNA generator which repressed by another taRNA.

<P style="line-height:110%">
taRNA responsive HHR (TR-HHR) was fused with taRNA. By using orthogonal riboregulator sequences, we designed three of taRNA generators.

TR-HHR was designed by Benedikt Klauser and Jo¨ rg S. Hartig. Their TR-HHR were inspired by the riboregulatory system previously reported by Collins and coworkers. They made use of sequence domains of the riboregulator RR12. And, orthogonal variants of riboregulator RR12 (RR12y, RR42) were reported by Collins and coworkers. So, by using the sequences of these orthogonal riboregulators, we designed three orthogonal TR-HHRs.

Result and Discussion

<P style="line-height:110%">
In the presence of taR12, GFP fluorescence value divided by OD value is higher than one in absence of taR12. This result was not expected. HHR has the ability to self-cleave, but its ability is suppressed when taRNA hybridizes to HHR. Therefore, in the presence of taRNA, self-cleavage of HHR should not happen. So then, why we get such result? One factor can be due to the exposure of RBS sequence caused by the structural change of HHR when it hybridizes to taRNA

 In order to evaluate a function of TR(42)-HHR-taR12, we used crR12-GFP as a reporter.
taRNA is complementary to the sequence of crRNA, and by the binding of taRNA to crRNA, RBS is exposed and gene expression is activated. In this result, the GFP fluorescence value divided by OD value of (2) was lower than that of (3). It shows that taR42 suppressed self-cleavage of TR(42)-HHR and caused less GFP expression. Therefore, we prove that the self-cleavage activity of TR(42)-HHR and amount of taR12 can be controlled by taR42.

We must confirm whether taR12 and TR(12)-HHR set is available for RNA oscillator.
The second experiment result showed high background, then we should try to use lower promoter to transcribe crR12-GFP.<FONT size="6"><STRONG>Reference</STRONG></FONT><P style="line-height:110%">
