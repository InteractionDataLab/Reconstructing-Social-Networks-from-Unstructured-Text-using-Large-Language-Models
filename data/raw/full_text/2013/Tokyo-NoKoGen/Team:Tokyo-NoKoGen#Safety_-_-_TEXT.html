Our Safety Form
Q.Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks?
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No, the biological materials used in our lab work do not pose any risks to the safety and health of lab members. We perform all experiments fully equipped with safety glasses, lab coat and gloves. We do not treat any toxic chemicals or subbstances. All experiments are performed in safety level 2 room.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No, the biological materials used in our lab work do not pose any risks to the safety and health of lab members. The only species we use is Escherichia coli, all of which are classified as risk group 1. They do not harm human health, and will not survive long outside the laboratory.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No, the biological materials used in our lab work do not pose any risks to the environment. Escherichia coli that we handle will not survive long out side the laboratory.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countriest?
Our BioBrick part cannot be directly used for malicious misuse, because our aim for this year's project is to create a light oscillator, which only uses naturally existing proteins such as GFP and luciferase.
Q.If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
We used E. coli (strain B and K12) as main chassis organisms and there are instruments and method to deal with large scale of these E. coli. So, there will be little risks if we use our E. coli as a commercial/industrial product.
Q.Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
Our constructed recombinant E. coli must be treated in dark condition, because it has some light sensors, so we are trying to make the recombinant E. coli die when it is exposed to sunlight (UV light). If these E. coli escape from the lab (dark condition), it will die.
Q.What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution's safety training requirements, if available.
Our lab group holds safety meeting every Monday. In the meeting, we report any danger that arose in a week. We record it on our website but we cannot provide you the URL due to our data security.
Q.Under what biosafety privision will/do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines

b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you amde to your project plan based on their review
We have our own Instutitional Biosafety Committee and as our past iGEM teams, we submitted report about our experiment. Our instructors are monitoring our experiments closely, and they have not identified any safety issues.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible

d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
According to the manual, our lab has the room that meets the requirements for biosafety level 2.
Safety forms were approved on September 17 2013, by Kelly Drinkwater.
