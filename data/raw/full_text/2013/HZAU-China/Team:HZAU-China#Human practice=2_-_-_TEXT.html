A Visit To Keqian Biotech Company
On a breezing sunny day, we paid a visit to Keqian Biotech Company. A manager greeted us, first of all, he led us to a small house, where we can see the whole process of how workers do their jobs in the GMP (abbreviation of Good Manufacturing Practice) workshop through the video monitoring. Then, we were taken to the lobby to have a look at the layout of the entire workshop, alongside the manager’s introductions to the principles of interior design and operational requirements. Finally, he gave us some answers about vaccine.
We had a group photo in the front door.
The manager gave us a description of the whole layout of the workshop by design drawing in the labby.
The following is the main contents of our conversation:
1.The process of creating a new vaccine
Generally it will take a long period of time to select a vaccine strains and finally make it approved to come into the market.
2.Safety evaluations of vaccine before marketing
Every company has its own standard, when a new vaccine came out, it must pass its own standard then tested by COFCC, when all the tests have been passed, then it’s fine for it to come into the market.
3.Current vaccine market and its economic outlook
Right before you make a vaccine, you should know about the epidemiological situation and correctly estimate the benefits of it. There is no need to produce a a vaccine for a disease that has been almost eliminated. To produce a vaccine, we need a good strain to improve yield and quality, we need good technology of vaccine adjuvants. By the way, there is a huge marketing potential here in China.
4.The research progress of oral vaccine and live vector vaccine
A large proportion of vaccines today in the market are traditional vaccines. Considering its  absorption effect and the relatively vast land, veterinary oral drugs are very rare in China. But live vector vaccine is something we should definitely try and develop.
Finally, special thanks to the welcoming manager, and thanks to Keqian Biotech Company!
