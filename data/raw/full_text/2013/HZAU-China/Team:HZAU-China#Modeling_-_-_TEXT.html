Overview
Abstract: In order to know how many fleas that carry our engineered strain could make the stray dogs in an area immune to the rabies virus, we developed computational models to simulate the process and to demonstrate our ideas. Our model consists of three parts: “immune response”, “gray logistic”, and “cellular automaton”. The “immune response” model is to analyze the kinetic relationship between the antigen and antibody during the immunologic processes. The “gray logistic” model is to simulate the growth curves of the Bacillus subtilis in the blood of dogs. The “cellular automaton” model is used to simulate the spread of our engineered bacteria in dogs.
