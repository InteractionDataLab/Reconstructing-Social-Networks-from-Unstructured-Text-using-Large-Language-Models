PROJECT: Safe Moving Vaccine Factory
ABSTRACT
Our idea comes from Yersinia pestis and fleas. We make use of fleas as our moving injector. When fleas feed on blood from dogs, our vaccine vector Bacillus subtilis will be regurgitated into blood and successfully transferred to mammalian host. Bacillus subtilis can express antigens which can stimulate the immunity of dogs. Meanwhile, endogenous or exogenous expression of "Antimicrobial Peptides" by B. subtilis can kill Yersinia pestis in fleas. In this way we achieved a safe moving vaccine factory.
Overview of our project
55000 people die of rabies per year and about 95% of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. We hope our project can help in reaching the WHO goal of being free of human rabies by 2020. This section shows the core consideration of our project.
Yersinia pestis and flea
Yersinia pestis can form biofilms to colonize the proventricular of flea. Blocked fleas can transfer Yersinia pestis to host. The mechanism has been widely researched. Although it is too early for us to release clean fleas, we do spend a lot of time in thinking of this mechanism. You can find the details of this interesting mechanism in this section.
Cellular automaton
In order to know whether safe moving vaccine factory can reach 70% vaccination coverage of dogs, Cellular automaton model has been used to simulate the spread of immunity.
Judging form
This year is the first time we attend iGEM. And we applied to attend this competition on April 27,2013. It must be a big challenge for anyone to finish iGEM in just six months. We finished this hard work with trial and error. From our judging form, you can know what we have done in six months.
Helpful Ideas
We are iGEMers this year! It is a big challenge for us to finish the assessment of safety at the beginning of our work. We think every new iGEMer will face this kind of challenge. So we made suggestions on safety assessment for your new iGEMer guys! We hope these helpful ideas can provide some useful information for safety assessment.
