We submitted 9 parts.
BBa_K1228000 is coding for Human Lysozyme (38 aminoacid peptides).
BBa_K1228002 is coding for Rabies virus strain ERA glycoprotein.
BBa_K1228004 is coding for a fragment of loctoferrin. (25 aminoacid peptides)
BBa_K1228005 is a composite which contains 25 aminoacid peptides with T1 terminator. (BBa_K731722)
BBa_K1228007 is a composite which contains 38 aminoacid with constitutive promoter veg.
BBa_K1228006 is a generator which contains BBa_K541503 and BBa_K1228005 . It is coding for 25 AA peptides which is a part of Lactoferrin. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a multifunctional member of the transferrin. Lf is found at the mucosal surface where it functions as a prominent component of the first line of the host defense system against infection and inflammation. This protein has a broad spectrum of anti-infection and anti-inflammatory function. Meanwhile lactoferrin has a broad anti-bacterial range and strong anti-bacterial activity.
Fig. 1 Inhibition zone was found in LB plate, which indicates that the protein has an antibacterial activity.
BBa_K1228008 is a generator which contains 38AA peptides with promoter veg and T1 terminator. The peptides is a part of Human  lysozyme. Human Llysozyme (hLZ), the major protein in breast milk, exhibits microbicidal activity to various degrees against several bacterial strains. The 38AA peptides and its N-terminal helix (H1) were the most potent bactericidal to bacteria. Evidence shows that 38AA peptides and its N-terminal helix (H1) kill bacteria by crossing the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria via self-promoted uptake and is able to dissipate the membrane-potential-dependent respiration of Gram-positive bacteria.
Fig. 2 Inhibition zone was found in LB plate, which indicates that the protein has an antibacterial activity.
BBa_K1228009 is a fusion peptide which contains 25 AA, 38 AA, T1 terminator and promoter veg. The fusion peptide may have a stronger antibacterial activity than any one of the origin.
Fig. 3 Inhibition zone was found in LB plate, which indicates that the protein has an antibacterial activity.
BBa_K1228010 is a device secreting rabies virus ERA glycoprotein in B.subtilis. It contains the Promoter veg, RBS spoVG, SacB signal peptide (BBa_K541501) and the coding sequence of Rabies virus strain ERA glycoprotein.(BBa_K12280002)
Fig. 4 Western blot has been used to test the expression of glycoprotein in B.subtilis. The molecular weight of Marker is 72KD. Glycoprotein is 67 KD. it was successfullyexpressed in B.subtilis.
The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved. These genes code for nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the viral RNA polymerase (L).The complete genome sequences range from 11,615 to 11,966 nt in length. Because of containing the neutralizing epitopes which are the targets of vaccine-induced immunity, the glycoprotein can stimulate the organism to produce antibody against Rabies.
