Safety forms
The safety forms include three parts.
Form I is for the basic safety.We listed our chassis organisms. Also, we answered some basic safety questions, and described the laboratory safety level as well as the risks to the public and environment.
   Form I
Form II is for rabies G protein. Because the level of rabies G protein is II, so we must make a separate form for it. We briefly introduced the source of the part and the potential risks it will cause.
Form II
Form III is for our vaccine carrier--fleas. But we haven’t used them in our experiments. This form is just for a future expectation.
Form III
