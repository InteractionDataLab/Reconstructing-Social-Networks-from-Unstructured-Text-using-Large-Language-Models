The report for interviewing Doctor Chen
In order to find ideas for our first ethical assessment, In June 20th, 2013, we interviewed of Dr. Chen Hao in National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement of HZAU.
In the conference room, we briefly introduced the content of our project again. Mr.Chen began to show us the safety assessment of genetically modified rice. It involved applying to the Ministry of Agriculture project, a detailed safety assessment pilot Conditions and the production after the security risk estimates. When he asked us if we were familiar with the rabies G protein as well as the level of security about fleas, we felt sorry and knew that the safety assessment had had been a real pressure, we did not even know what a risk assessment rating. To address this issue, Chen made several suggestions to us. First, to better understand the safety assessment rules, at home and abroad should be covered. Second, set up a team of your own safety assessment methods, so that other people can have a more clear understanding on our evaluation criteria. Finally, if we wanted put into production, you must go to the relevant enterprises to multi-site visits and inquiries.
In the interview, Chen made our deepest hopes and wishes. Through this meeting, we learned the preliminary knowledge of safety assessment .In the following days , there wiould be great progress.
