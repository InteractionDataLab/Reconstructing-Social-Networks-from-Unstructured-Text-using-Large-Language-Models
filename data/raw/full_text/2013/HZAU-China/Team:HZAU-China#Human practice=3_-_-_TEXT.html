Making Synthetic Biology Popular
Our team decided to participate in this competition on April, 28th. It’s a little bit late, but it is the first time we take part in international competitions. Our first time! So we are determined to make it shining and known by more and more people around us.
To go for it, we have to do some publicities. This time, our team has two main focuses on the publicity. First, introducing iGEM to the students and the public, making people get familiar with what on earth iGEM and Synthetic Biology are. Second, when we finish our project, we want to show public what we have done and make them impressed.
The first step, iGEM and Synthetic Biology introduction, let’s begin! Given the fact that this is the first time, we were sure that people in our school have little knowledge about what iGEM is. Hence we thought for a long time and eventually decided to do the Introduction through the means of distributing leaflets. To prepare for this, we borrowed two booths and printed the posters, meanwhile, we made billboards and hundreds of fans. On June 8th, we made every effort to capture people’s eyes and attentions, gave away our leaflets and fans, orally introduced iGEM with a video played on the laptop. At first, people ignored us a little bit, but inspired by our passion, people’s curiosity started to awake. That made it much easier for us to get to the next step. Beautifully done with it ! Bravo!
