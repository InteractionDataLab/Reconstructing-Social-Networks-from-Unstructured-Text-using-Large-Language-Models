BMBF-Conference
In June 2013, three team members of Team Tübingen joined the “Biotechnologie 2020+”-conference in Berlin, Germany.  The conference is held by the association of BMBF (i.e. Federal Ministry of Education and Research), universities, and research companies and intends to establish new production methods in biotechnology. All German iGEM-Teams presented their posters, attended discussion panels and lectures. Furthermore, the conference gave the opportunity to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about cooperation possibilities with the other teams.
