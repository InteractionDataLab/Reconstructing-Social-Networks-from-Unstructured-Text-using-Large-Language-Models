PCR
Reagents
39.5 µL
Aqua dest.
2.5 µL
dNTPs (200 µM each)
1 µL
DNA (c = 100 ng/µL)
5.0 µL
Taq-Buffer
0.5 µL
Forward primer
0.5 µL
Reverse primer
1 µL
Taq/Pfu polymerases (9+1)
 
Procedure
Mix all reagents in the given order (Important: add polymerases last!) and transfer in one 0.2 mL Eppendorf-tube ("PCR-tube"). Run cycler according to your requirements.
This protocol yields exactly one single reaction mixture! Scale linearly for multiple reaction mixtures and keep mixture on ice or even better at -20 °C for best results.
