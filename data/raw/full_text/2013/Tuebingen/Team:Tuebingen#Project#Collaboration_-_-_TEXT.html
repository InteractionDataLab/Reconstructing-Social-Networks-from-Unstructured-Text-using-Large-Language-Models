Collaboration
This year, we collaborated with Team BGU Israel who were working on a kill-switch mechanism. Team BGU had sent us their pUC57 cI plasmid ( BBa_K354000 ) that contains CRB resistance and a cI repressor gene with a Lac/Ara-1 IPTG inducible promoter. The promoter is induced by arabinose and IPTG, while glucose represses it. The cI protien is a repressor for both, holin and lysozyme (toxins) genes which are part of the self-destruct mechanism that was devised by Team BGU. As long as there is cI protein in the cell, there is no expression of the toxins - therefore the cell stays alive. In order to better understand the behavior of this system, it is important to characterize the promoter in regard to how IPTG, arabinose, and gluose concetrations and the induction time have impact on the amount of cI protein the cell synthesizes.
In agreement with Team BGU, we had planned to carry out a HPLC and a bradford colorimetric protein assay in order to determine the cI protein concentration inside the cells.
Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the measurements with their parts because due to long delivery times their parts shipping arrived only shortly before Wiki Freeze.
Nevertheless we were able to help each other out with the planning and execution of the characterization of some parts. We thank the Team BGU for their efforts and the good conversations and hope that this collaboration will continue even more successfully next year!
