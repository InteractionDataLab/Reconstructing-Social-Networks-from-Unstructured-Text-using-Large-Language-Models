Colony-PCR
Reagents
0.5 µL
MgCl2 (c = 25 mM)
1.0 µL
10x Taq Polymerase Buffer
0.1 µL
dNTPs (2.5 mM each)
0.1 µL
Oligo forward
0.1 µL
Oligo reverse
7.7 µL
Aqua dest.
0.1 µL
Taq Polymerase (5 U/µL)
 
Procedure
Put some PCR-tubes on ice.
The given volumes are for one single reaction of 15 µL. When checking more than one colony, repare a master mix for all colonies. Keep that master mix on ice all the time!
Transfer 10 µL of master mix in every ice-cold PCR-tube (1 PCR-tube per colony).
Usa a pipet tip in order to pick up a colony from a fresh plate and transfer the colony into the reaction mixture inside a PCR-tube.
Smear the tip over a new LB plate + antibiotic in order to create new colonies.
Run PCR and control success via gelelctrophoresis .
Store plates of successful colony-PCRs at 4 °C.
