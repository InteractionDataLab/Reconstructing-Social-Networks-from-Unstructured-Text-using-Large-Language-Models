3A-Assembly
Digestion
Reagents
2.5 µL
10x NEBuffer 2
0.25
100x BSA
250 - 300 ng
Plasmid DNA
0.5 µL
EcoRI or XbaI
0.5 µL
PstI or SpeI
to 25 µL
Aqua dest.
1/10 vol
10X Antarctic Phosphatase
 
Procedure
Mix all reagents (except for Antarctic Phosphatase) in an 1.5 mL Eppendorf-tube and incubate at 37 °C over night.
On the next day, heat inactivate restriction enzymes at 80°C for 20 min.
Add 1/10 volume of 10X Antarctic Phosphatase and mix. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min for 5' extensions.
Heat inactivate phosphatase at 70 °C for 5 min.
Perform the previous steps for upstream part plasmid, downstream part plasmid, and destination part plasmid. Digest upstream part with EcoRI / SpeI, downstream part with XbaI / PstI, and destination part plasmid with EcoRI / PstI.
