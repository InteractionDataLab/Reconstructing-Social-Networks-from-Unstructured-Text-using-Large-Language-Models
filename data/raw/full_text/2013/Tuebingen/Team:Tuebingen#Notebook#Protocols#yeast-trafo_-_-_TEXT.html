Yeast Transformation
Procedure
Scrape some yeast cells off a fresh YPD plate and inoculate in liquid YPD (= culture).
Thaw ssDNA ("helper DNA" e.g. salmon sperm DNA) and heat for 10 min at 95 °C, then chill on ice.
Pellet 1 mL of culture by centrifugation at > 13.000 rpm.
Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 µL ONE-STEP buffer . Vortex heavily.
Add 20 µg ssDNA (10 µL of 2 mg/mL) and 100 - 500 ng plasmid DNA to be transformed. Vortext and incubate at 45 °C for 2 h.
Add 1 mL YPD, mix and spin 10 sec at full speed. Discard supernatant.
Resuspend cell pellet in 1000 µL YPD and plate 100 µL directly on appropriate selective plates.
Colonies appear after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C.
