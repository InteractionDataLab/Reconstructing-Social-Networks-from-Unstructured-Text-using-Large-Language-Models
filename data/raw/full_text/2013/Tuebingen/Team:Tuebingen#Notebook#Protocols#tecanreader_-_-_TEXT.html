Using the Tecan Reader
The Tecan reader is used for flourescence spectroscopy. Thus, tested cells should express some sort of flourescent protein. We mainly tested yeast cells that express mOrange ( BBa_E2050 ).
Procedure
Inoculate 5 mL liquid YPD medium with yeast cells. Create 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of this liquid culture. Incubate all cultures at 30°C over night.
On the next day, check OD600 (culture density). Ideally, OD600 is between 1 - 1.5 (maximum: 2.0).
Transfer cells to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 30 sec.
Discard supernatant and add 1 mL Aqua dest. Resuspend cells.
Inoculate 1/3 of initial culture volume (minimum: 600 µL) liquid YPD (OD600 should be between 3 - 5) with cells from previous step.
Transfer cells to a cuvette, dilute 1:10 with Aqua dest., and measure exact OD600 (necessary for standardization of measured data).
Transfer 150 µL cell suspension in a black 96-well-plate. Create a 150 µL water blank.
Measure cells in Tecan-Reader. Adjust settings according to your requirements.
Our settings:
Plate: Greiner 96 Flat Bottom Black [half area]
Mode: Flourescence intensity
Excitation: 548 nm
Emission: 581 nm
Gain: 150
Number of flashes: 25
Time of integration: 25 µs
If required record excitation spectrum.
Our settings:
Plate: Greiner 96 Flat Bottom Black [half area]
Mode: Flourescence Scan
Excitation: 300 - 550 nm
Step size: 5 nm
Emission: 581 nm
Gain: 150
Number of flashes: 25
Time of integration: 20 µs
Standardize measured data to OD600 = 1.0.
