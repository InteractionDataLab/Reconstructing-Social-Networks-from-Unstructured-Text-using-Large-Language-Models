Today, the annual iGEM contest is the world’s leading undergraduate synthetic biology competition – and each year, U of L students regularly rank among the top iGEM teams worldwide.</P><DIV class="float_AG"><P class="comp_media_image_after_AG">University of Lethbridge iGEM students Isaac Ward, Mackenzie Coatham, Harland Brandon and Erin Kelly are among the best young researchers in the world.<SPAN lang="en-ca"> 
								Courtesy of University of Lethbridge Adancement.</SPAN></P></DIV><P>An emerging field, synthetic biology sees cells, enzymes and metabolic pathways as more than biological entities; they’re sophisticated parts that can be programmed like machines to perform specific activities. As a result, research in synthetic biology is opening up remarkable possibilities in such sectors as agriculture, pharmaceutical, medical diagnostics, clean energy and resource extraction. In 2011, for example, U of L students developed a petrochemical-eating bacteria that could be used to help clean up water in tailings ponds, a discovery that placed the University’s iGEM team among the top 16 competitors in the world, alongside students from Harvard University, MIT, the University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University.</P><P>This October, the U of L’s iGEM team once again demonstrated its strong innovation abilities. In addition to creating a bioengineering part that works like a zip drive, compressing genetic information, the team developed software that rapidly determines what DNA sequences are compatible to compress together. These inventions, which will allow future bioengineers more flexibility in their research, captured top prize in the 2013 North American iGEM Regional Jamboree held in Toronto. Moreover, the first-place finish secured the team – made up of Dustin Smith (BSc ’13), Graeme Glaister, Jenna Friedt (BSc ’11, MSc’13), Suneet Kharey, Harland Brandon (BSc ’12) and Zak Stinson – a spot in the international iGEM competition, which will be held at MIT in November.</P><P>Providing students with the opportunity to compete against teams from around the world is just one way iGEM benefits its participants, says U of L biochemistry professor Dr. Hans-Joachim (H.J.) Wieden. Considered the driving force behind the U of L’s iGEM teams, Wieden serves as the students’ advisor and coach. He is also a highly respected researcher in his own right.</P><P>Director of the Alberta RNA (Ribonucleic acid) Research and Training Institute at the U of L, Wieden was also recently appointed the Innovates Centre of Research Excellence (iCORE) Chair of Bioengineering. Funded by a $2-million investment from Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures, the role enables Wieden’s research team to study how biological systems can be engineered to achieve breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry, biochemistry, health and nanoscience.</P><P>“iGEM enables students to get their first taste of research,” says Wieden. “They understand the goal of the project, and learn how to think outside of the box, troubleshoot and apply their knowledge to create scientific discoveries. All of this unlocks students’ creativity.”</P><P>What’s more, he continues, iGEM cultivates students’ entrepreneurial potential. The teams manage their own projects and raise funds to support their work, as well as learn how to communicate effectively and connect their work to real-world needs. Finally, as young researchers themselves, they come to realize the importance of supporting the forward-thinking scientists of the future: high school students.</P><P>To that end, U of L students have started iGEM teams in high schools in southern Alberta. And those high school students are following in the success of their older counterparts. Earlier this year, in fact, a team of Lethbridge high school students representing schools from across the city, won the Green Brick grand prize at iGEM’s international High School Jamboree at MIT, as well as trophies for Best New Biobrick Natural for their engineered DNA part and Best Wiki, the website used to display their project.</P><P>Advised by Wieden as well as U of L undergraduate and graduate students, the high school team – consisting of 22 students from Lethbridge-area high schools, including Keiran McCormack, Chris Isaac, Elaine Bird, Fiona Spitzig, Yoyo Yao, Patrick O'Donnell and Katie Thomas, who represented the team at the jamboree – successfully created a longer lasting form of Oxytocin. A hormone that’s most-commonly used to aid childbirth, Oxytocin degrades quickly and soon becomes unstable, making it expensive and difficult to store.</P><P>While such complex projects can be challenging for high school students, the research experience is invaluable, says former iGEM high school team member Erin Kelly.</P><P>“Being on the high school team was a steep learning curve, but I learned research methods through hands-on experience and that definitely made the transition to university easier,” says Kelly. Now a second-year biochemistry student at the U of L, she serves as an advisor to the current iGEM high school team along with fourth-year neuroscience student Isaac Ward and master of biochemistry student Mackenzie Coatham (BSc ’12).</P><P>The trio, all former members of the undergraduate iGEM team, have used their resulting research and entrepreneurial skills to launch the spinoff company Synbiologica Ltd. Along with Brandon (now a U of L master’s student in biochemistry), and U of L neuroscience professor Dr. Gerlinde Metz and Wieden as advisors, the group is in the process of patenting their big idea – a biomedical technology that provides rapid hormone-detection results. Their idea is expected to be 93 per cent more cost-effective than traditional antibody technology, bringing the next generation of hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.</P><P>In recognition of its scientific innovation, the Synbiologica team has earned numerous accolades. They include winning $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition and taking first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge, an annual business-planning competition hosted by Community Futures Lethbridge Region. The group received an additional $10,000 in cash, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect: An Alberta centre for new commerce – a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge – plus a range of other in-kind prizes, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and several thousand dollars worth of media services.</P><P>“iGEM gave us the motivation and skills to explore multidisciplinary research,” says Ward, chief executive officer of Synbiologica. “And from there, we realized that we don’t have to follow the usual career route. We can create our own jobs.”</P></DIV><H3>Synbiologica records another win</H3><DIV class="indent_AG"><P>by <A href="http://www.uleth.ca/unews/profile/trevor-kenney">http://www.uleth.ca/unews/profile/trevor-kenney</A> June 12, 2013 </P><P>It's win number two for the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.</P><P>CEO Isaac Ward (third-year neuroscience student), first-year biochemistry student Erin Kelly and chemistry and biochemistry master's students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon have developed a new method of detecting hormones, and are in the process of patenting their idea.</P><P>Their proposed biomedical device technology -- called &quot;Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time&quot; -- is expected to bring next-generation hormone detection to the research, agriculture and medical markets.</P><DIV class="float_AG"><P class="comp_media_image_after_AG">Pictured left to right are Mackenzie Coatham, Dr. HJ Wieden (team advisor), Erin Kelly, Harland Brandon and Isaac Ward.<SPAN lang="en-ca">

We have been encouraged at every turn by our professors and others to move this idea forward, especially by the people at Alberta Innovates -- Technology Futures (AITF) who promote entrepreneurial engagement from scientific innovation.”</P><P>Ward cited advisors Dr. Gerlinde Metz (Department of Neuroscience), Dr. HJ Wieden (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry), Dr. Roy Golsteyn (Department of Biological Sciences) and Michael Kelly (Erin Kelly’s father and Manager of Real Estate and Land Development, City of Lethbridge) as being particularly helpful as they refined their idea.</P><P>At an event held on Wednesday, June 12 in Lethbridge the Community Futures Lethbridge Region hosted an event that acknowledged the Synbiologica group for their win, and announced the additional winners of the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. </P><P>Lethbridge-based Ladybug Arborists took first place, while Strathmore business Kindred Companions and Lifesavers Designated Driving (Lethbridge) shared the runner-up awards.</P><P>For additional information about these up-and-coming businesses, please contact the Community Futures Lethbridge Region office through their website: <A href="http://lethbridgeregion.albertacf.com/">http://lethbridgeregion.albertacf.com/</A> or phone (403) 320-6044.</P></DIV><H3>South Venture Business Plan Competition Winners Show Diversity and Creativity</H3><DIV class="indent_AG"><P class="italic_AG">on Thursday, 28 March 2013.

Three finalists were chosen from 24 entrants that submitted business plans for the challenge. The winning plan came from the University of Lethbridge student researcher/entrepreneurs who form the Synbiologica Ltd. team.</P><P>This is the second win for the Synbiologca team, comprised of CEO Isaac Ward (3rd year, Neuroscience), first-year Biochemistry student Erin Kelly and Chemistry and Biochemistry masters students Mackenzie Coatham and Harland Brandon. They developed a new method of detecting hormones, which they expect will bring next-generation hormone detection to the research agriculture and medical market. They are in the process of patenting the the a biomedical device technology -- called “Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-Time&quot;.</P><P>Not only did the group win $10,000 in the South Venture Business Plan Competition in March, they also took first place in the Tech Stream side of the Chinook Entrepreneurial Challenge. With that, came another $10,000, a one-year lease on space in the tecconnect Centre for New Commerce (a high-tech business incubator operated by Economic Development Lethbridge), as well as a variety of other assistance, including business consulting from MNP and ActionCOACH, and thousands of dollars in media services.</P><P>Because the biomedical technology is in a patent phase, not many details can be released. However, it is designed to improve the way in which hormones are detected and provide more accurate information in a reduced time frame. The new technology also has the potential for a wide array of applications.</P><P>Quoting a U-of-L release, Ward stated the team came up with the idea to develop the company and the new biomedical device by using the skills they learned through the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) program.</P><P>“The internationally competitive program allows undergraduate students to gain hands-on experience in science,” Ward said. U of L teams have claimed several top international honours at past competitions, and three of the Synbiologica entrepreneurs are off to Boston Massachusetts, toward the end of June as advisors to the U of L's high school iGEM team.

MEDICINE HAT NEWS</P><P>A biotech company started by a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge came out on tops in the ninth annual Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge.</P><P>“It’s been a really exciting experience,” said Isaac Ward, who alongside Harland Brandon, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham have established Synbiologica a small biotech company based out of Lethbridge that is developing a method of rapid hormone detection.</P><P>Ward and Brandon represented Synbiologica Wednesday at the Medicine Hat Lodge for the CEC, competing in the portion of the competition for tech businesses. Competing against MathFileFolderGames.com and PlentyFull Services, they presented their business plans, took questions from judges, and were ultimately named the winner.</P><P>“It’s really about supporting local grown entrepreneurs,” said Geoff Rougeau, business analyst/project co-ordinator with Community Futures Lethbridge Region about the annual competition that will wrap up June 12 with judging for those in the general category taking place in Lethbridge. Participants come east to west in southern Alberta, all the way north to Camrose.</P><P>The competition starts with eight weeks of free training for interested small businesses, provided through Community Futures throughout southern Alberta including the chance to meet with accountants, lawyers and other resources, Rogeau explained. Participants then have a month to finalize and submit a business plan, and these submissions are whittled down to three finalists for the general and brand new tech business category.</P><P>As scientists, Ward said the opportunity to participate in the program to learn about business is “beyond beneficial.”</P><P>“Business training isn’t in our course load,” said Ward, thanking all the advisors, Community Futures and everyone who helped them along their way so far.</P><P>“We’re thankful we have an opportunity to pursue this, and to see others think it’s an idea to pursue as well gives a real sense of encouragement.”</P></DIV><H3><SPAN class="bold_AG">Team: Synbiologica CEC Site Idea: <SPAN class="italic_AG">Technology</SPAN></SPAN></H3><DIV class="indent_AG"><P> “We found the diversity of the workshops to be not only eye opening but also very informative.  The speakers that were brought in provided a lot of one on one time with participants to cater advice for their business.”</P><P>Mackenzie Coatham</P><P>Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly, Mackenzie Coatham, and Harland Brandon are four science students at the University of Lethbridge who are developing a hormone detection device called Biologically Enhanced Assay in Real-time (BEAR). As their studies at the U of L don’t include any business training, they signed up for the Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge and its 8 week training program.</P><P>The team of four students are currently working out of the laboratories at the University of Lethbridge, and are being advised by professors at the University. Isaac and Erin are currently obtaining their undergraduate degree while Mackenzie and Harland are master’s students. When asked if it is difficult to handle their duties for Synbiologica and their studies, Isaac responded “As with many start-ups it takes a lot of work but with integrating planning, dedication, and most importantly team work, we feel confident that our commitment to education will be enhanced through real world application.”</P><P>While Synbiologica is still in the research phase and has yet to produce a prototype of BEAR, they are already looking to future applications of their product. They plan to market it to scientific researchers – more specifically ones focused on endocrinology and neuroscience – but also feel that BEAR will be useful in an agricultural or medical application.</P><P>These four students are excited about their idea, and while it may be a few years until BEAR is fully functional and approved for use, they remain committed to their research.</P></DIV><H3>U of L Scientist Win Entrepreneur Challenge</H3><DIV class="indent_AG"><P>Posted by Genome Alberta via <A href="http://genomicsnews.ca/en/users/genome-alberta.html">medicinehatnews.com</A>, 4 months ago</P><P>A biotech company started by a group of scientists from the University of Lethbridge came out on tops in the ninth annual Chinook Entrepreneur Challenge. “It’s been a really exciting experience,” said Isaac Ward, who alongside Harland Brandon, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham have established Synbiologica a small biotech company based out of Lethbridge that is developing a method of rapid hormone detection. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
