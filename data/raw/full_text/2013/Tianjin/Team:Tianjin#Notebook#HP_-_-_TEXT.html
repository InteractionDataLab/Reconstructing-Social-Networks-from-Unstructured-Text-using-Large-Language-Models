The Second Week of May
TJU-IGEM team spent a week to read the wiki of other iGEM teams 2012 in order to to learn from what other teams had done, and we tried to make our human practice more meaningful and colorful.
The First Week of June
We held a forum to discuss our human practice this year. Every team member put forward some creative suggestions. In the end, we made our human practice schedule.
The Second Week of June
We built the web site on the four platforms to introduce iGEM and the knowledge and development of the synthetic biology to people. We hoped to bring the secret of life to more people and open a new window of the synthetic biology for them.
The Third Week of June
OUC-IGEM team came to Tianjin University in order to communicate with us. We gave them a warm welcome and introduced them our experience. Both teams got improvement of team construction and project development.
The Second Week of June
We cooperated with Ruijing Senior High, and showed some students who are interested in biology around labs in Tianjin University. We arranged lectures and encourage them to take part in High School Division of iGEM.
The First Week of July
We make our plan and preparation for our IGEM handbook. It teach students to start a new team. Our handbook is composed of specific experimental guidance,  experience of outstanding teams, and introduction to golden projects.
The Second Week of July
We shared our ideas with them by lectures, visits and interviews, and we successfully helped Nankai University start their first iGEM team. We decided the final list through the selection from our team and Nankai CAST.
The Third Week of July
In this week, our team members recorded the audios of 60-Second Biology for promoting popular science.we made audios to introduce iGEM and molecular biology which are limited in 60 seconds.
The First Week of August
Our team has visited the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We discussed about both the advantages and limitations of our project when it brings to the factory.
The Third Week of August
We visited PetroChina Dagang Petrochemical Company to get a better understanding of oil production.By communicating with engineers from PetroChina Dagang petrochemical company, we can work on turning our products into productive force.
The First Week of September
Our team members came to Beijing, contacting with Tsinghua University in depth.During this communication, we exchanged views of some practical problems in the experimental.The successful exchange activities enhance our thoughts deeply.
The Second Week of September
We played an active role in the first Model iGEM competition in Beijing, which other 5 teams also took part in--Peking, Fudan, NJU-China, and OUC-China. We also built strong relationships with other teams.
