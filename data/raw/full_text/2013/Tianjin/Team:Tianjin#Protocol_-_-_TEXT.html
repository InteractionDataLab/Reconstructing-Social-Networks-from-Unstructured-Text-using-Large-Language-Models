PCR Purification
TIAN™quick Midi Purification Kit
1. Balance the absorption column
a. Put the absorption column CB2 into the collection tube. Add 500 µl of the buffer BL to the absorption column CB2 and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. Discard liquid and place the column back into the same collection tube.
2. Add the buffer PB
b. Determine the appropriate volume of the PCR reaction mixture.
c. Add 5 times the volume of the buffer PB to the mixture and then mix by shaking or overtaxing the tube in increments.
3. Absorption
d. Apply the mixture to the column. For volumes greater than 800 µl, load the column and centrifuge successively, 800 μl at a time.
e. Place the column at -20℃ for 5 min then centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature.
f. Apply the mixture in the collection tube to the column and then repeat step "e". Discard liquid and place the column back into the same collection tube.
4. Wash
g. Wash the column by adding 600μl of PW Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temp.
Note: PW Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use. See label for directions. If refrigerated, PW Wash Buffer must be brought to room temperature before use.
h. Repeat step "g" with another 600μl of PW Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol.
I. Discard liquid and centrifuge the empty column for 2 min at 12,000 rpm to dry the column. Do not skip this step, it is critical for the removal of ethanol from the column.
j. Place a column into a clean microcentrifuge tube. Then place the tube into the drying baker for 10min at 50℃ to dry the column matrix.
5. Elution
k. Add 50-70μl（depending on desired concentration of final product） of EB Buffer directly onto the column matrix.
l. Incubate at 50℃ for 2 min. Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm to elute DNA.
m. Apply the mixture in the tube to the column and then repeat step "l" to yield any residual DNA.
Gel Extraction of DNA (Spin Column Extraction)
TIANgel Midi Purification Kit

b. The gel is exposed to UV to find the DNA fragments (stained by Ethidium bromide).
c. The goal DNA band is identified.
d.  Physically  remove  the  slice  of  gel  contains  the  goal  DNA  with  clean surgical blade.
2.  DNA Purification
e. Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a Clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
f. Add 3 times volume of Buffer PN more than the gel slice (0.1g gel account for 100μl).
g.  Incubate  the  mixture  at  50°C  for  10  min  or  until  the  gel  has completely melted.
h. Mix by shaking or overtaxing the tube in increments of 2 minutes.
I.  Place a TIANGEN® DNA column CA2 in a provided 2 ml collection tube. Apply 500μl Buffer BL to the TIANGEN® DNA column, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. Discard liquid and place the TIANGEN® DNA column back into the same collection tube.
j. Apply 700 μl of the DNA/agarose solution to the TIANGEN® DNA column, incubate at -25°C for 5 min and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature.
k.  Put the liquid back into the TIANGEN® DNA column and redo j. Discard liquid and place the TIANGEN® DNA column back into the same collection tube. For volumes greater than 700 µ l, load the column and centrifuge successively, 700 μl at a time. Each TIANGEN® DNA column has a total capacity of 25μg DNA. If the expected yield is larger, divide the sample into the appropriate number of columns.
l. Add 600 μl Buffer PW diluted with absolute ethanol into the TIANGEN® DNA column and incubate at room temperature for 2 min. Centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature to wash the column. Discard the flow-through.
Note:   Buffer PW Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use.  See label for directions.  If refrigerated, Buffer PW must be brought to room temperature before use.
m. Redo step l and re-use the collection tube.
n. Centrifuge the empty TIANGEN® DNA column at 12,000 rpm for 2 min to dry the column. Do not skip this step, it is critical for the removal of ethanol from the TIANGEN® DNA column.
o.  Place  the TANGEN®  DNA  column opened into  a  clean  1.5 ml  microcentrifuge  tube and incubate at 50 °C for at least 15 minute until there is no smell of ethanol.
Add 50μl Buffer EB directly into the column and incubate at 50 °C for 5 minute. Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm to elute DNA.  This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.
