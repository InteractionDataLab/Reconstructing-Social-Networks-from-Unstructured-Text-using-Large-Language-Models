Judging Criteria
Judging Criteria
1. We collaborated with 5 other iGEM teams and helped BIT_China by sharing DNA materials, debugging and characterizing their parts! (for more details Click Here )
2. We outlined in detail two new approach of Human Pratice called "60 Second Synthetic Biology" and “Plague Inc”(in safety page) for “iGEM Leading-in”, which are based on our energy-related background of our project and enable more people to learn about Synthetic Biology in a short time, whether they are high school students or college students without an iGEM background. (for more details Click Here )
3. We submitted 12 high quality and well-characterized standard biobricks! Their functions worked as expected. (for more details: Click Here )
4. We improved a previous part, which is the part of Strong Constitutive Expression of ADC and AAR in pSB1C3 (BBa_K590025). The improved part is BBa_K1020008 .
5. We did a sensor device that can specifically detect intracellular concentration of alkanes for engineered E.coli. It’s a new approach to small-molecular selection. (for more details: Click Here )
6. We successfully constructed and well-characterized our alkane sensor in different ways to detect long chain alkane seperately. (for more details: Click Here )
7. A good filter was constructed to achieve higher productivity strains which may be applied in the field ofenergy. (for more details: Click Here )
Therefore, we believe that we deserve a Gold Medal Prize.
