We rehydrated the registry DNA biobricks including 13-P1-12D, 13-P1-12F, 12-P2-21F, 13-P3-11H, and 12-P4-4A. Then we transformed them into BL21. After restriction analysis of the plasmids, we prepared glyoerol stocks for BL21 with 12D, 12F, and 21F.

We purified the plasmids of 11H and 12D, after restriction analysis confirm, we inserted 11H into 12D. Next, we transformed 11H+12D into bacteria and got the plasmids to confirm. By inserting 21F into 11H+12D, we got one of our three plasmids. Finally, by using restriction analysis, we confirmed that the plasmid is right.

We got ndh via PCR, and ligated it with LVA tag, but the ligation of plasmids and new backbones was failed. To solve this problem, we used new ndh whose original backbone is pSB1A2, and inserted 21F into it. The construction of ndh with pSB1K3, pSB1C3, and pSB4K5 finally finished on July 25th

By protein confirm, we found that the protein our bacteria with GFP conveyed was incorrect. It was very difficult to make sure what happened to former steps. So we had to reconstruct plasmid GFP.

We got sfGFP plasmid from Peking University, and to construct a complete plasmid we need, we would add a LVA tag behind sfGFP's sequence, and then construct 21F+sfGFP-LVA+12D with pSB1C3 backbone.

Because we had constructed three plasmids we need, our next goal was to transform the plasmids into BL21(DE3). We first constructed a double-plasmid BL21: GFP+aiiA, and then we transformed the third plasmid into BL21 with two plasmids.

Although we have transformed three plasmids into BL21, the result was undesirable. We found that DH5α may be more suitable for our vector, so we decided to transform the plasmids into DH5α one more time.    Later we constructed 1A3 GFP, colE1＋GFP, sfGFP, colE1＋sfGFP, and aiiA/ndh pSB3T5, so we transformed all these plasmids into DH5α for our new work of construction.

We compared protein bands between BL21, the blank control and three groups transformed into different single plasmids, aiiA, ndh and gfp. These two gel pictures were got in two different days.  Data analysis:   The target proteins of pSB3T5-aiiA/BL21 and pSB4K5-ndh/BL21 should not be expressed because the promoter should be induced by AHL. The target proteins of pSB1C3-gfp-luxI/BL21 have been expressed but GFP was misfolded we suppose. However, the band marked in red was not the target band. Maybe it's the complex of AHL-LuxI.

2013/9/26 22:07:07
We performed a SDS-PAGE comparing expression of double plasmids, gfp and aiiA, and two corresponding single plasmids. What's more, we wanted to find more details about band which possibly is the misfolded gfp.  Data analysis:   The band marked in red disappeared is pSB1C3-gfp-luxI/BL21.The LuxR, GFP and AiiA  are the same of size (marked in yellow). However the band of AiiA was not clear. Many target proteins were misfolded. Therefore the culture condition should be optimized.

Characterization of expression of E.coli transformed into triple plasmids and testing if our target proteins expressed by our constructed gene circuits were concentrated in precipitation or supernatant  (8.12)
2013/9/26 22:07:46
Description :  We had transformed triple plasmids into one E.coli and the DNA gel picture indicated it was ligated successfully. So now we were very eager to know if our circuits could work well in E.coli. Furthermore, we wanted to know that if our target proteins expressed by our constructed gene circuits, in other words, pSB1C3-gfp-luxI and pSB13T5-aiiA were aggregated in precipitation or supernatant. So we run SDS-PAGE using BL21(blank control), three cells transformed into different single plasmids(aiiA, ndh and gfp), one cell transformed into double plasmids(aiiA and gfp) and our E.coli transformed into triple plasmids in three forms respectively, whole cell, precipitation and supernatant.  Data analysis:   From the SDS-PAGE gel pictures, we could easily find that the clear AiiA band (marked in red) but NDH was not clear in PAGE because the gene ndh did exist in the genome DNA of BL21 native strain.
2013/9/26 22:08:31--Tang Chun
2013/9/26 22:08:47
We've found that maybe there's some mistakes in our strains which cause us couldn't get a expected microfluidic experiment result. And we analyzed that DH5α maybe a better strain than BL21 so we changed the host. We firstly confirm the expression of three single plasmids transformed into DH5α.  Data analysis: The band marked in red was not the target band. Maybe it is the complex of AHL-LuxI. The target proteins of pSB1C3-gfp-luxI have been expressed while the target proteins of pSB3T5-aiiA and pSB4K5-ndh did not be  expressed because the promoter should be induced by AHL.
2013/9/26 22:09:10--Tang Chun
2013/9/26 22:09:28
We were suggested that DH5α has a better viability and a higher protein expression. So  there's some mistakes in our strains which cause us couldn't get a expected microfluidic experiment result. So we compared two identical groups cultured at different degrees, 30℃ and 37℃.  Data analysis: E.coli maybe cultured at 30℃ had a stronger expression of protein from picture 1 but we were confused by picture 2 cause it indicated that expression at 30℃ is not larger than expression at 37℃.
2013/9/26 22:09:40
Future plan: 1.It's much better to culture at 30℃ rather than 37℃. 2.Does it better for us to use superfolded GFP? 3.Change another ultrasonic instrument or high pressure homogenizer.

Description:   We changed high pressure homogenizer to get cell fragments, in order to gain a more definite gel analysis. The high pressure homogenizer is under 37.5 kpSI  which supposed much too high to make protein. Even the super protein is far less compared with gel picture made after ultrasonic fragmentation, the unclear band is still there.  Data analysis: The band marked in red was not the target band. The band marked in green was not the target band.

Description:   We were confused for our dislocation of GFP on SDS-PAGE gel pictures for a long time. So we decided to use three different marker to confirm our marker.  Data analysis: There is a paradox between A A and A: E.coli cultured has a stronger expression of protein when not added AHL？

Description:   We characterize our biobricks using additional AHL. We bought commercial AHL powder and prepared it into solution. The AHL added into these cells was 1000 nmol/L and BL21 was wild type.   Data analysis: The band marked in yellow disappeared.  There is a difference between N and N+A： The band marked in green/red shows that  E.coli cultured has a stronger expression of protein when  added AHL?

As we have made BL21(WT) with several plasmids, it was necessary to determine the OD and fluorescence value of the bacteria so that we could know if BL21(WT) with the plasmids was able to oscillate. To achieve the goal, we used enzyme-labeled instrument. By sampling and measuring on time, we could see that if our circuit would work smoothly.   After sampling per hour, we centrifuged samples at 6,000g for 10min. And then we discarded flow-through liquid. Next, we added PBS buffer into bacteria. Using enzyme-labeled instrument, we got a serious of data of OD and fluorescence value. We did it three times.
