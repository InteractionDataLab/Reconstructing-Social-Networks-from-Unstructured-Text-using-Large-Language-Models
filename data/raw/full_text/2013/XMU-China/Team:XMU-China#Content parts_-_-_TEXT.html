Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Confirmation for all Plasmids
pSB1C3-gfp-luxI
This plasmid consists of two parts of target genes: gfp and luxI, and both of them are regulated by quorum sensing promoter. High copy number. (Fig.7-1)

pSB1C3-sfgfp-luxI
This plasmid consists of two parts of target genes: sfgfp and luxI, and both of them are regulated by quorum sensing promoter. sfGFP gene is included into this plasmid as a parallel experiment group of pSB1C3-gfp-luxI. High copy number. (Fig.7-2)

Summary & Future work
Future Work (Keep Practicing)
Oh, no, time is up for iGEM Competition, our glee has no more time to play, but pack their luggage and head for MIT. But let's see what they have made so far and what they still have to do if they really want to be a success.

Need to do:
Microfluidic
Have done:Finished building two different arrays, find basic testing parameters.
To do:Confirm more suitable microfluidic parameters for oscillation.
Strain
Have done:Confirmed DH5a's incompetent in express oscillation;
To do:Make a comparison between BL21 (WT) and BL21 (DE3) in SDS-PAGE and so on.
Copy number
Have done:Have done: Compared the arrangements of high-middle-low copy number and middle-middle-low copy number's effect on oscillation.
To do:Try other arrangements..
Fast Degrading Tag
Have done:Found LVA-tag is not fast enough for our oscillation circuit.
To do:Try LAA or other fast degrading tag for comparison.
