	Tina Zhang is our advisor. She guided us to open the door of synthetic biology and walked us all the way through this competition. Although she knows quite a lot about molecular biology experiments as far as we’re concerned, she’s still humble and fond of learning. As a stringent experimenter, she corrected everyone’s experimental performances. Sometimes we could not help murmuring at her rigorousness and strictness to some extent. But we all feel lucky to have such an awesome advisor from the bottom of our hearts. Tina Zhang always encouraged us to fight tooth and nail to this competition and she told us ”Your strength will equal your days”. Her firmness and persistence which shoulder the heavy responsibilities for our team encouraged every members of XMU-China 2013.
    
    We all love you, Xia Jiejie!

Xin Wu has taken part in iGEM twice. The past three years have witnessed his great contribution to iGEM and synthetic biology. As an experienced iGEMer, he gave us countless insightful suggestions from team development to improvement efficiency of our teamwork. Researching in synthetic biology, he gave us some piece of good advice when brainstorming. Furthermore, owing to his two years' experiences about iGEM, he helped us a lot in numerous things such as registration and payment. The last but not the least important, he’s really a humorous man and good at improving the team’s morale. We couldn't get this far without his encouragement and help.
