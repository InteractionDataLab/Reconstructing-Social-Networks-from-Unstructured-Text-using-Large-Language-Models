Our Team
XMU-China 2013
Our team consists of 11 undergraduates, 3 advisers and 3 instructors. We come from different faculties, including Chemistry, Chemical engineering, and Bioengineering, but we all belong to the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. There is not only strength in numbers, but also creativity. We brainstormed every single idea from circuit construction to name cards in this inspiring project along with joy and laughter.
We want to express gratitude to our beloved Prof. Grace I-Son Ng, who not only offered us her lab, but also gave us a lot of useful suggestions and encouragement throughout this project. When we had the first crisis she told us that joining iGEM is like hiking, as the altitude is getting higher, the harder it would be. However, the view would be better. Now we are trying our outmost to top the iGEM mountain and have a look at the synthetic biology world. We also appreciate Prof. Chaoyong James Yang's generous help when we had some problems in building our microfluidic devices. Furthermore, we shall extend our deepest thanks to Prof.Baishan Fang, the first organizer of XMU-China.

Our Instructors
Associate Prof. I-Son Ng
Dr. I-Son Ng is an associate professor in College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University. Her research interests are biofuel, engineering of enzyme and protein, zymology, genetic engineering, biochemical separation procedures and proteomics. Her role for the project is to provide suggestions and instruments.
Prof. Baishan Fang
Dr. Baishan Fang is the professor in College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University. In the group of biocatalysis and biotransformation, his research mainly focuses on synthetic biology, mining and the transformation of enzyme, construction of bio-molecular machines, the application of new biocatalysts. His major role of XMU iGEM team is to mentor all and to enlighten the members.
Prof. Chaoyong James Yang
Dr. Chaoyong James Yang is an professor in College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University. His research focuses on microfluidics, molecular recognitions, DNA self-assembly and early diagnosis of cancer. He provided us with equipment for microfluidic experiments.
Our Advisors
Xia Zhang (Tina)
Tina Zhang is our advisor. She guided us to open the door of synthetic biology and walked us all the way through this competition. Although she knows quite a lot about molecular biology experiments as far as we’re concerned, she’s still humble and fond of learning. As a stringent experimenter, she corrected everyone’s experimental performances. Sometimes we could not help murmuring at her rigorousness and strictness to some extent. But we all feel lucky to have such an awesome advisor from the bottom of our hearts. Tina Zhang always encouraged us to fight tooth and nail to this competition and she told us ”Your strength will equal your days”. Her firmness and persistence which shoulder the heavy responsibilities for our team encouraged every members of XMU-China 2013.          We all love you, Xia Jiejie!
Xin Wu
Xin Wu has taken part in iGEM twice. The past three years have witnessed his great contribution to iGEM and synthetic biology. As an experienced iGEMer, he gave us countless insightful suggestions from team development to improvement efficiency of our teamwork. Researching in synthetic biology, he gave us some piece of good advice when brainstorming. Furthermore, owing to his two years' experiences about iGEM, he helped us a lot in numerous things such as registration and payment. The last but not the least important, he’s really a humorous man and good at improving the team’s morale. We couldn't get this far without his encouragement and help.
Zhichao Guan
Zhichao Guan is a graduate from Prof. Chaoyong Yang’s lab. He gave us selflessly help in everything about microfluidic experiments. He taught us how to collect microfluidic pictures, how to process a mass amount of data and how to extract useful messages from the data. In addition, he helped building our microfluidic chip and gave us some important suggestions. Although sometimes he appeared to be severe and cool, we were all aware of his trustworthiness.
Our University
Xiamen University
Xiamen University was founded in 1921 by Tan Kah Kee, the well-known patriotic overseas Chinese leader. Over the past ninety years, as the result of following the school motto: Pursue Excellence, Strive for Perfection, Xiamen University has accumulated rich experience in offering its educational programs and has presented its distinctive features in running the programs. The main campus of XMU locates in a picturesque setting between the sea and a scenic mountain, spreading over 150 hectares, and is generally regarded as the most beautiful campus in China. See more
Our City
Xiamen
Xiamen is a coastal city located in the southeast coast of China popularly known as the Garden on the Sea. An early poet once described the city in this way: "A city leans on stones like a flower; millions of mountains embrace the sea", which was a true portrayal of the scenery of Garden on the Sea. There are many good reasons to visit Xiamen: With good food, some great architecture and a mild to hot climate, Xiamen is hard to beat. See more

4. Communicate with post-graduates and instructors
E-mail:471333136@qq.com
Viola is an opmistic girl. Her duty was to organize the team work. She took part in the design of our idea and construction of circuit. She seemed to be the glue of the team who combined all parts together and dealt with some detail problems.
Xin Guo (Stella)
1. Final organizer of the wiki information
2. Microfluidic tester
3. Constructor of the report part
4.      Communicate with instructors and advisors
E-mail:guoxin1104@gmail.com
Stella has been busy all day testing microfluidic chips and writing wiki contents at night. In her spare time between different experiments she will always take her favorite camera and taking pictures of our lab and teammates. This project is challenging and she is enthusiastic about solving all kinds of challenges.
