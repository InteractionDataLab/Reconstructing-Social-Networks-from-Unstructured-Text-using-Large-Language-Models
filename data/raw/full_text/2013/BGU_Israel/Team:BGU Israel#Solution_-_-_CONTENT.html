                        The processes of bioremediation, biosensors and bio-medicine often require the release of genetically modified organisms (GMO's) to the environment. After being released, these GMO's are no longer under direct control, therefore posing potential threats such as substituting the natural bacterial population, horizontal gene transfer, and lastly, creating public concern and opposition to the field of genetic engineering.
                        In order to overcome these issues, we are designing a genetic circuit that limits the lifetime of a bacterial population after it is released into the environment. Our ultimate goal is to allow the end user to program a GMO population to survive in the environment until it has completed its task, after which the entire population will disappear. Crucially, our mechanism will function independently, without any external intervention. 
                        We are approaching this goal from two angles: <STRONG>&quot;P.A.S.E 1&quot; </STRONG>is based on the dilution of a vital component through cell division, while <STRONG> &quot;P.A.S.E 2&quot; </STRONG> is based on the lifetime of an essential protein. The two methods utilize novel mechanisms such as a recombination cassette, the innovative use of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) in a biologic gate, and more. We also intend to introduce new biobricks that will be useful for a wide range of purposes, including bacterial genome incorporation parts and UAA incorporation machinery. This project will be the first modular, independent and generic bacterial control system. 
                        We want our construct to pave the way to a safe synthetic revolution: one that will allow developers to innovate and create freely without arousing public opposition or harming the environment. </P></DIV><DIV><H2>P.A.S.E 1 </H2><H4>Objective</H4><P>Creation of a modular system to program E.coli to destroy themselves after a predetermined amount of time.</P><H4>Overview</H4><P>Our system consists of two parts – a protective element and a lethal element. The protective element is overexpressed only in the presence of a specific inducer, provided in a controlled environment. As long as the protective element is present in the cell, it prevents expression of the lethal element. Through cell division, the protective element will be diluted, and eventually, when its concentration will fall under a critical threshold, it won’t be able protects the cell from the lethal element. 
This system is autonomous – unlike a “kill-switch”, it does not require any external intervention after the bacteria has already been released to the environment. Additionally, the system is intended to be programmable – through controlling different overexpression parameters; it is possible to affect the concentration of the protective element before the bacteria are released. The higher the concentration upon release, the longer the cells would be able to live outside the lab.
</P><H4>Behind the Design</H4><P>
                         After having decided what our project will be, we sat down and devised a general mechanism to make it work, as described in the overview above. It seemed to us, at that point, that we have done a great deal of the planning. But as we started looking for actual parts and biobricks that we could use to make our plan a reality, we realized the real challenge was still ahead of us – the registry is so big, that there is simply too much to choose from!
We knew what kind of parts we need:        1. A toxin         2. A repressor/promoter couple  to regulate the toxin expression         3. A regulation system to control the expression of the toxin regulating repressor 
While we had to look for the first two parts, it was rather obvious for us what we should use for the third – the famous lacI/lacO from the lac operon we all learned about in Microbiology 101. We were eager to work, and it happened so that the lab we worked in had a stock of pGFPuv – a plasmid containing GFP gene under the regulation of lacO. So, we started conducting a long series of experiments with two goals:        1. Verifying that lacI/lacO is tightly regulating the gene under its control.         2. Quantifying the different level of expression under different inducer (IPTG in this case) concentrations – in order to show our system could be potentially “programmable”. 
After a lot of experiments (detailed in the July section of our lab notebook) and further theoretical research we came to two conclusions – the lacI/lacO is very “leaky” and the inducer concentration has no effect on the levels of expression [4], despite what our results have shown. We learned that different levels of fluorescence achieved by different inducer concentration, are the not the result of different expression levels on the single cell basis – they are the outcome of a bimodal distribution. All cells are either “on” (induced) or “off”. The ratio between the cells which are on and the cells which are of is the reason for different fluorescence measured.
We wanted to reproduce the experiments that lead to this conclusion, so we used FACS analysis on our e. coli with pGFPuv. The FACS was done on 3 different cultures: IPTG induced BL21 pGFPuv, uninduced BL21 pGFPuv, and uninduced BL21. 
These results we produced show that the conclusion mentioned above is correct (x axis is fluorescence, y axis is cell count). The left graph shows that the induced culture could be divided to two sub populations – one which expressed GFP, and one that didn’t. The middle graph shows that even when uninduced, most of the cells do produce GFP, which supports the fact this regulation system is leaky.
We had to return to the drawing table. After a thorough searching session we found an interesting promoter that might suit our 2 goals (tight &amp; programmable) – lac/ara-1 promoter – part BBa_K354000. This promoter is activated by induction with IPTG and/or L - arabinose. [1] This promoter functions as a fourway switch - using different variation of inducers (IPTG/Arabinsoe/IPTG+Arabinose/no inducer) allows the user to adjust the induction strength and levels of expression. We also thought since this promoter has binding sites for two repressors instead of just one, it would be tightly regulated.
We also found a toxin and the suitable repressor/promoter, as detailed below.</P><H4>Detailed design </H4><P>
                         The chassis used for the system is E. coli, strain BL-21. The functional system has two parts:</P><H6>1. pUC57 plasmid</H6><P><OL class="ablist"><LI class="ablist">cI repressor gene (the protective element) - part BBa_K327018, edited to remove the LVA tail, which was originally meant to cause rapid degradation of the protein.

The expression of this gene is regulated by the araC/lacI promoter. </LI><LI class="ablist"> lac/ara-1 promoter – part BBa_K354000.

However, one of the most important requirements of our system is that <B><I>all cells must contain the toxin genes.</I></B> In light of this requirement, plasmids pose a problem – their stability is influenced by the nature of the host cell, the type of plasmid and/or environmental conditions. Plasmid encoded properties may confer a selective advantage on the host cell but can be an energy drain due to replication and expression <B>[2]</B>. In our case – not only they confer no selective advantage, they carry a selective disadvantage! So, even if one cell would lose the toxin plasmid, it would not die, quickly giving rise to a population without the self-destruct system. In order to overcome this obstacle, we chose to use a cassette which undergoes recombination into the chromosome. The cell cannot lose the toxin gene, and is assured to pass it on to all daughter cells. This ensures the stability of the gene in the entire population. 
                            Using recombination has another advantage for our system. Because the gene is located on the chromosome instead of plasmid, it has the lowest copy number possible. This theoretically makes the protective element effective at lower concentrations, which would allow for a longer life time of the population. <B>Assembling the system</B> requires three transformations (although ultimately the cell will contain only one plasmid, and one addition to the chromosome):

                        Creation of a modular system to program <I>E.coli</I> to destroy themselves after a predetermined amount of time.</P><H4>Overview</H4><P>
                        In this system, we intentionally encode for a nonsense stop codon (TAG) mutation in one of <I>E.coli’s </I>essential genes – Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (tyrS). Its location in the <I>E.coli</I> genome is 1,713,972 - 1,715,246 ( - ); 36.94 min; 1275 (bp) , 424 (aa). In addition, we add an inducible promoter, AraC/LacI, for the regulation of the expression of this gene. Unable to translate this gene, the bacteria will lose most of their protein synthesis capabilities, resulting first in proliferation arrest and eventually death. We then introduce into bacteria a specific machinery, which allows the suppression of the TAG stop codon, resulting in translation of the essential tyrS gene (See detailed design section). Suppression is possible only when all the machinery is in place and when a special “building block” (in the form of an unnatural amino acid), is present. Moreover, only when induced by external compounds, the required machinery and the essential protein itself will be translated. 
This mechanism is designed as a <B>“logic AND gate”</B> – the bacteria are dependent on two different inducers (Arabinose and IPTG/Lactose) regulating transcription, and a special “building block” (Unnatural Amino Acid – UAA) for the translation regulation. All three compounds are relatively rare in most natural environments. In the lab, the engineered cells are supplied with the building blocks, machinery and inducers, thus synthesizing the essential protein in large quantities. Once the bacteria are released from the controlled environment (i.e. the lab), this protein naturally degrades over time. In the absence of the building blocks and the machinery inducer the bacteria cannot synthesize more of this essential protein. Once the protein reaches a critically low concentration the cell cannot sustain itself and dies. Currently we are working on creating one nonsense mutation in our target gene, however theoretically multiple nonsense mutations can be introduced, rendering the system even safer. 
Similar to our first approach (P.A.S.E 1), this system is also autonomous – unlike the &quot;kill-switch&quot;, it requires no external intervention to function after it has been released to the environment. It can also be programmable - through controlling different parameters during induction, it is possible to affect the concentration of the essential protein before the cells are released. The higher the concentration upon release, the longer the cells would survive. Additional control over the lifetime of the bacteria is possible through controlling the lifetime of the essential protein itself (N-terminus mutations), or choosing to work with different essential proteins with different lifetimes.

You are welcome to watch a short schematic 3D animation depicting P.A.S.E. 2:</P><H4>Detailed design </H4><P><H7>A short introduction to unnatural amino acids (UAA)</H7>
                         Other than a few exceptions, the genetic code is universal and encodes 20 amino acids, the building blocks of all proteins. Recently, it has become possible to incorporate man-made amino acids into proteins by using the degeneracy of the genetic code. The incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) enables the production of proteins with novel properties for new applications. The incorporation of UAAs uses the cell's natural protein synthesis machinery by introducing a pair of tRNAcua and tRNA-synthetase that do not cross-react with (i.e. are orthogonal to) endogenous natural amino acids/tRNA-synthetases/tRNAs.  
                         A general approach of creating a system that will incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins is described by L. Wang and P. G. Schultz <B>[1]</B>: the system that was developed consists of a tRNA and tRNA synthetase set that is orthogonal to the other amino acids and amino-acyl-tRNA-synthethases in the cell. The orthogonality of the system is achieved by using natural tRNA and tRNA-synthethase pair from another species, the archae Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. After mutating the tRNA anticodon sequence to C-U-A to suppress the Amber stop codon (UAG), the tRNA and the synthethase were randomly mutated in chosen locations to produce a library for selection of the mutant with the desired properties. The selection of mutants was done by a series of negative and positive selection tests for orthogonally, ability to suppress the amber stop codon, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids into a protein. The gene of the target protein is site-specifically mutated to insert the amber stop codon (TAG) in the desired site for the incorporation of the UAA. The Amber stop codon was chosen since it is the least used stop codon in the E. coli’s genetic code (only 314 sites are known) and therefore is not anticipated to interfere with the synthesis of other proteins. <H7>The chassis used for the system is <I>E.coli</I>, strain BL-21.
