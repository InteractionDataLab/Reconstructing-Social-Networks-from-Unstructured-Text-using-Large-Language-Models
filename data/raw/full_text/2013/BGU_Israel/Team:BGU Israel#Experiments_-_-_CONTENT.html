	1. A starter was diluted 1:50 with 10 ml LB, 10 µl CRB X 6 vials. 
	2. The vials were put in incubation for 2 hours until the O.D. reached  ~0.3
	3. 1 mM of IPTG was inserted in each vial and the vials were returned to the incubator for 4 hours.
	4. Centrifugation for 10 min, 4000 RPM of the 6 vials.
	5. Separation of the fluid from the precipitation. 
	6. Bacterial precipitation of each vial was mixed with 10 ml LB, 0.1 ml 50% Glucose and 10 µl CRB.
	7. Samples of the vials we taken to a 96 well plate and was put in the plate reader for 9 hours with 30 min intervals of O.D. and FLU examination.

	Results:
	
	An average of the 6 vials has been taken and the decline rate has been calculated by a graph of the decline period only. 

	Conclusions:
	1. Even though the medium with IPTG has been removed and replaced, the initial 2 hours showed a continued induction of IPTG on the expression of GFP. Possible explanation is that the IPTG that was in the bacteria diffused very slowly to the medium which didn’t contain any. Therefore, it is needed to take into account when calculating a specific duration of induction, the amount of time the inducer will diffuse out of the bacteria. 
	2. After 2 hours there was a significant decline in FLU while the bacteria still in the Log phase. An equation of the decline rate was determined. The values of FLU/O.D. here declining because of the increase of O.D. while FLU stayed constant. This explains how GFP is diluted during bacterial growth and its FLU per cell declines by the equation listed in graph 2.<H7>29.7.2013 IPTG induction on GFP expression over time</H7>
	1. Starters were diluted by the following (amounts in ml):

	2. The vials were put in incubation for 2 hours until the O.D. reached  ~0.3
	3. IPTG was added by the following amounts:

	4. 1 ml was taken from each vial into separate 15ml and the vials returned to the incubator. 
	5. Centrifugation for 10 min, 4000 RPM of the 5 samples.
 	6. Separation of the fluid from the precipitation. 
	7. Wash X2 with 0.1M PB.
	8. Bacterial precipitation was mixed with 1 ml PB of each sample.
	9. O.D. and FLU we read from the plate reader.
	10. Steps 4 thru 9 were repeated every 30 min for 4 hours.

	Results:
	
	Conclusions:
	1. 0.5% glucose has shown once again that it is much stronger than the induction of IPTG on the expression of GFP and therefore there was no increase in FLU. 
	2. While the bacteria were in their Log phase from the beginning, a significant increase of FLU has been identified only after 3 hours. Therefore the long response time of the bacteria to IPTG indicates that in order to model the rate of protein expression as a result of induction, it is needed to take into account a 3 hour delay.
	3. The initial 3 hours have not shown any difference between the different concentrations of IPTG. However, once the induction has started to kick in (after 3 hrs) a gap has been formed between them when the 2 mM IPTG had the most FLU and the 0.5 mM IPTG had the least.<H7>29.7.2013 Transformation of pkd78 to Electro-competent cells</H7>

                    1. The bends around 30 KDa suggest expression of cI though its not guaranteed. If so, there is a leak, but either way there is a very high rate of expression of cI which is a good thing.
                    2. The bend is much bigger with IPTG which shows that the promoter works fine. It is important to check the initial O.D.  because each lysate has different amounts of protein.<H7>31.8.2013 Comassie analysis for the lisate products made on 29.8</H7>

                    It was impossible to identify anything. Probably because the protein concentration in the lysate was too low.<H7>31.8.2013 Comassie analysis on cI expression under various conditions</H7>

                    2. The vials were diluted 1:40 with the new LB in the same conditions and incubated until the O.D. reached 0.6.
                    3. The vials were processed through protein extraction by lysis protocol and comassie staining by comassie protocol.<B>Results:</B>
                    No bands were noticed on the gel! A possible reason could be because there wasn't enough lysate in the first place because intentionally the bacteria grew to only O.D. 0.6 so there could be an analysis only on live bacteria and not dead ones but seems that it's not enough to analyze protein expression.<H7>31.8.2013 PCR to amplify pKD78 backbone and CRB resistance</H7>

                        Other than the GK cassette and the pKD78 b bone, all the reactions worked and they were purified. Regarding the two that didn't, a possible reason could be that because the templates are very long (2000-5000bp) there should be a much longer extension time during the PCR reaction. <H7>20.9.2013 - PCR to make cI his tag gene a biobrick:</H7>
                        pUC 57 cI his tag generated by site directed mutagenesis (from 18/09 - 2 different samples) was used as a template to create a standard biobrick cassette to be inserted into psB1C3. The primers used are B his + stop F and B cI TU R.

                        The PCR products were purified using QIA quick PCR purification kit. Purified DNA concentration - 28 ng/μl.

                   It’s clear that there is pUC57 cI in the cells though there was no amplification of GK. However there was no amplification of the control either.
