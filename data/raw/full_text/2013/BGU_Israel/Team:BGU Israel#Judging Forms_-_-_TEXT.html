Judging Forms
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2013 Judging form.
Description of the team's project has been created & shared using the iGEM wiki                   and the team's parts were shared using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Nine new standard Bio-Brick Parts or Devices used in our project were submitted                                          to the iGEM Registry.
A new application of, and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing                   the Part's/ Device's function), of a previously existing BioBrick part in the 'Experience' page of                   that part's Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM                    Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K1223002, BBa_K1223003, BBa_K1223005, BBa_K1223006, BBa_K1223007, BBa_K1223011.
Requirements for a Silver Medal:
We have Experimentally validated that our new Bio-Bricks Parts or Devices of our                                        own design and construction works as expected.
We have documented the characterization of this part in the 'Main Page' of                                        that Part's/Device's Registry entry.  this new parts were submitted to the iGEM                                        Parts Registry. Part Number(s): BBa_K1223002, BBa_K1223003, BBa_K1223005, BBa_K1223006,                                        BBa_K1223007, BBa_K1223011
Implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics were taken into                                                    consideration in the design and execution of your project. Link to page on your team's wiki: Problem
Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Improving the function of an existing BioBrick Part, new registry page has been created for the improved part, and it was submitted to the iGEM Registry according to iGEM Registry guidelinesPart Number(s): BBa_K1223005, BBa_K1223007
Collaboration with several registered iGEM team from other institutions by characterizing a part, debugging a construct. Link to page on our team's wiki: Achievements
A new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to our project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation. Link to page on your team's wiki: Survey
iGEM Prizes
We feel that our project should be evaluated for the following special prizes: Best Human Practice Advance Our goal was enabling synthetic biology projects to progress from the lab to real-world applications, and in our approach to human practices, we focused on understanding the source of public opposition and encouraging multi-layer dialogue. First, we wanted to understand the public’s concerns and level of familiarity regarding synthetic biology, and so we created a large-scale survey, the first of its kind in Israel. With the results of the survey, we embarked on a massive outreach campaign, designed to encourage discourse and address some of the concerns raised, creating a direct dialogue between researchers and the general public. We triggered discussions not only in traditional platforms, but also in unexpected and playful ways such as caricature contest, wine festival, synBio for kids -  to make the subject accessible to all. Lastly, we took measures to build a foundation for continuity in our university, to make sure that the conversation about synthetic biology has only just began. Best Model Since statistics and probability are catchphrase in the field of biology we have developed a stochastic model which describes the feasibility of our system and gives a quantitative assessment of the system activity while taking in consideration the leakage & strength of the promoter in order to give a brighter picture for the risk assessment, presented in three dimensional neat graphs.

Best new BioBrick Part or Device, Engineered: Part Number(s): BBa_K1223007 Short description of improvements made to the part: Improved part (BBa_K327018). We replaced the LVA tag with his tag and added an inducible promoter(BBa_k354000) to create a functional translational unit to enable easy quantitative characterization of protein expression.
