Cristina Vilanova
I am a biotechnologist currently doing my PhD at the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology unit of the ICBiBE (UV). My work in the lab consists in implementing different systems biology - and "omics" - based approaches to the bioprospection of natural habitats.
Lucas J. Morales
I am a biotechnologist.
I am hardworking, cheerful, motivated and like to laugh. My hobbies are playing guitar, reading, watching series and computing.
I found very interesting the part of modeling applied to biology.
Alejandro Vignoni
I'm an Electronic Eng. and I'm doing my PhD in Control Systems oriented to Synthetic Biology.
I play the guitar as a hobby (although I've studied almost all my life) and I like traveling, biking, swimming, rock climbing, yoga, taking pictures and many things more...!!!.
Gabi Chacón
I'm a chemical engineer and biotechnologist about to start a phD in systems biology. I got involved with synthetic biology in 2010, when I was part of the Valencia iGEM team. Then i was advisor in 2012 and I'm back this year as an advisor again, famous for his bad advices hehe.
Sergio López
I am a biologist with an specialization in Genetics sciences. Nowadays I am a PhD student, working on Evolutionary and Comparative Genetics in ICBiBE (Valencia). Describing the molecular basis and the evolutionary history of insect-bacteria symbiosis is my thesis goal.

Manel Porcar
About me. I lead the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology lab in the Cavanilles Institute (University of Valencia, Spain). I am the coordinator of the Valencia Biocampus Project and I also supervise the Human Practices sub-team.
The competition is a very challenging experience. I have been involved in five editions and I hope to stay in touch with the iGEM world.
In the future. In believe that Synthetic Biology will experience many important changes in the close future. iGEM might be one of the topics that might evolve.
Daniel Ramón Vidal
I made my PhD working at the Dep. of Molecular Genetics of the pharmaceutical company Antibióticos S.A. Then I moved to the Univ. of Wageningen as a post-doc. I was Professor of Food Tech at CSIC and UV. Currently I am CEO of Biópolis S.L. My interests are microbial biotech and the production of microbial metabolites. I'm author of more than 100 articles and co-author of 30 patents. I've obtained the European Prize of Divulgation, the Prize of the Danone Institute, and the National Price in Technology Transfer.
Emilia Matallana
I am a teacher of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Valencia and my research is focused on molecular biology and biotechnology of yeasts, specifically on oxidative stress responses and technological performance of industrial strains.
Jesús Picó
I am a control engineer fascinated by the world of systems and synthetic biology. I lead the group of Control of Complex Systems at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, where I am Professor of Automatic Control. Our main interests are in feedback control of bioreactors, robust methods for estimation of metabolic fluxes and flux balance analysis, and nonlinear feedback control techniques applied to quorum sensing-based synthetic circuits.
Marta Tortajada
I am a chemical engineer, specialized in automatics and system engineering, particularly fond of systems biology.
I work in applied biotechnology in the company Biopolis, in projects related to the production of microorganisms and valuable metabolites, such as recombinant proteins, active pharmaceutical ingredients, alcohols and microbial polymers.
Juli Peretó
I am an evolutionary biochemist working at the University of Valencia, at the Cavanilles Institute for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology.
I try to teach metabolism to biotechnologists and I am a passionate of the studies on the origin of life and the history of the ideas on the natural origin and the artificial synthesis of life. Currently I am the director of the international summer school “Origin, Evolution and Future of the Biosphere” (Erasmus Intensive Programme) and second vice-president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life.
Rosario Gil
I am a Doctor in Pharmacy, and an Associate Professor of Genetics. I teach Genetics, Molecular Genetics and Genomics at the University of Valencia. As a member of the Evolutionary Genetics group at the Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, my research interests focus on functional genomics of endosymbiotic bacteria from insects, minimal genomes, the evolution of metabolism in bacteria and synthetic biology.
Team - Universities
University of Valencia
Our university, founded over five centuries ago by the Juries of Valencia, has become a modern, public university that teaches all areas of knowledge: social, economic and legal sciences, experimental sciences, engineering, health sciences, educational sciences and humanities.
The university community is committed to being a university of reference: we are ranked second in Europe in receiving Erasmus students and fourth among Spanish universities in research. According to the most prestigious international rankings, we are ranked fourth in Spain.
Polytechnic University of Valencia
The Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV) is a public educational institution that offers modern, flexible degrees that are designed to meet the demands of society, as well as official postgraduate programmes that are subject to demanding educational quality control systems.
It has three campus sites: Vera (inside the city of Valencia), Alcoy and Gandia, with a total of 36.186 students, 2.843 members of teaching and research staff, and 2.396 administrative and services staff.
