How does it work?
P. putida
C. elegans
The Riding
Pseudomonas make a biofilm on the worm
The Calling
The nematode is attracted towards substrate-rich hotspots
E. coli
The Clumping
RNAi from ingested E. coli triggers nematode altered behavior in the form of clumping
Building the bioplastic (PHA)
As a result, Pseudomonas concentrate in the desired substrate-rich hotspot and do their work

Ten Tales on Synthetic Biology
We have writen a book, "Ten Tales on Synthetic Biology", in which we aim to show an utopic point of view but also a catastrophic one. With that, we want to make people aware that the best option would be to do responsible research.

WormBoys in 150 words
Bacteria are essential in biotechnology, but they can hardly move. Nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are fast crawling organisms, but they have limited biotechnological applications. By combining the best from both organisms, we present the first artificial synthetic symbiosis with bacteria engineered to ride on worms, which concentrate in hotspots where bacteria perform a desired biotechnological process, such as bioplastic (PHA) production. We have engineered Pseudomonas putida with a whole operon that allows the formation of a biofilm on the worm. Biofilm formation is switched on and off depending on the media, and thus bacteria get on and off the worm like travellers on a bus. We have also engineered a third partner, Escherichia coli, to express an interference RNA that promotes clumping. Taken together, our artificial symbiosis allows biotechnologically interesting bacteria to travel on nematodes, reach nutrient-rich biomass spots and maximize the efficiency of biotechnological fermentations in heterogenous substrates.
