Bacteria are essential in biotechnology, but they can hardly move. Nematodes, such as <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, are fast crawling organisms, but they have limited biotechnological applications. By combining the best from both organisms, we present the first artificial synthetic symbiosis with bacteria engineered to ride on worms, which concentrate in hotspots where bacteria perform a desired biotechnological process, such as bioplastic (PHA) production. We have engineered <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> with a whole operon that allows the formation of a biofilm on the worm. Biofilm formation is switched on and off depending on the media, and thus bacteria get on and off the worm like travellers on a bus. We have also engineered a third partner, <I>Escherichia coli</I>, to express an interference RNA that promotes clumping. Taken together, our artificial symbiosis allows biotechnologically interesting bacteria to travel on nematodes, reach nutrient-rich biomass spots and maximize the efficiency of biotechnological fermentations in heterogeneous substrates.
</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Coli"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Why_E.coli">Why <I>E.coli</I></SPAN></H2><P><B><I>Escherichia coli</I></B>
    is a model organism widely used in fields such as microbiology, molecular biology and genetics. Because of this, there is a great range of genetic manipulation
    techniques related with this Gram negative bacterium. There is also a lot of information about the biochemistry and genetics of this
    microorganism. All this allows us to work easily with it in the lab and perform assays testing different conditions that will be tried out in other
    organisms unstudied in such depth. Moreover, <I>E.coli</I> is the main food of <I>C.elegans</I>, organism that is able to incorporate nucleic acids from the
    bacteria, RNA, to its cells (Mello et al., 2004). This is the usual mechanism to transform C.elegans, introducing exogenous genetic material from
    the bacteria and altering the expression of the worm’s genome in order to make modifications of interest.
</P><H2>Controlling the mechanism</H2><P>
    The role of <I>E.coli</I> in our project is to carry out the synthesis of an iRNA to induce the social feeding behaviour of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>
   , the <B>clumping. </B>To achieve this, we cloned the biobrick Bba_K1112000 in <I>E.coli</I>, <B>XL1-Blue strain (fig. 1). </B></P><DIV style="clear:both;width:100%;height:auto;overflow:auto;"><DIV style="float:left;width:650px;padding-left:15px;clear:right;"><P><B> Fig. 1.</B></P><UL style="padding-left:25px"><LI><B>pSB1C3</B> is a high copy number plasmid (RFC [10]) carrying chloramphenicol resistance.
</LI><LI>
    The replication origin is a <B>pUC19-derived pMB1 </B>(copy number of 100-300 per cell).
</LI><LI>
    pSB1C3 has terminators bracketing its MCS which are designed to prevent transcription from *inside* the MCS from reading out into the vector. The
    efficiency of these terminators is known to be &lt; 100%. Ideally we would construct a future set of terminators for bracketing a MCS that were 100%

This<B> construction</B> consists of the <I>E.coli </I>fadA promoter, which is <B>activated in the presence of fatty acids</B> (Clark, 1981), and the
    antisense sequence of the mRNA <I>FLP-21 </I>from <I>C.elegans</I> which encodes a protein involved in the solitary feeding behaviour of the worm, the formation
    of the dsRNA complex inhibits the expression of this protein, inducing the social feeding behaviour (<B>fig. 2)</B>.
</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Pseudomonas"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Pseudomonas_putida_and_PHA_production"><I>Pseudomonas putida</I> and PHA production</SPAN></H2><P><B><I>Pseudomonas putida</I></B> is a gram-negative bacterium that is found in most soil and water habitats where there is oxygen. Its diverse metabolism and its capacity to break down
    organic harmful solvents (most of its genes are involved in degrading aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons) in contaminated soils make this microorganism
    irreplaceable for research studies in the field of bioremediation but also for biosynthesis of value-added products. In addition, <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> has several strains including KT2440, the one we have worked with. This strain can colonize plant roots, from which they take nutrients, while at the same time it offers protection for the plant against pathogens.
</P><DIV style="width:550px;float:left;"><P>
For example, it is capable of converting <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene" target="_blank">styrene</A> oil into the <B><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic" target="_blank">biodegradable </A><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhydroxyalkanoates" target="_blank">PHA</A><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic" target="_blank"> plastic</A></B>. This helps the degradation of the polystyrene foam which
    was thought to be non-biodegradable. Styrene is a major environment toxic pollutant released from industrial sites. The conversion to PHA allows the cure
    of styrene pollution but it is also beneficial for society because of its applications in tissue engineering.

 PHA is also environmentally friendly and has a long self-life therefore it is also used in everyday items. Unlike styrene, PHA can break down in soil or water.
</P><P>
    Within <I>Pseudomonas putida</I>, PHA accumulates under unbalanced growth conditions as a means of intracellular storage, storing excess carbon and energy.
    These PHA polymers are synthesized by the enzyme PHA synthase which is bound to the surface of the PHA granules and uses coenzyme A thioesters of
    hydroxyalkanoic acids as substrates.
</P></DIV><P>
    The role of <I>P. putida </I>in the Synthetic symbiosis that we have designed is to be carried by <I>C. elegans </I>to hotspots of interest where it would
    produce bioplastic, PHA.
</P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Elegans"><H2>An overview about our nematode</H2><P>
  One of the main characters of our work is a nematode known as <B><I>Caenorhabditis elegans, </I></B>from the Rhabditidae family. It was first used as an
  experimental model in Developmental Genetics studies and nowadays it is also used in other fields such as Clinical Biology, Neurobiology and Cell Biology,
  being a good model to study Alzheimer disease, obesity, diabetes and aging, among others.
</P><P>
  Another interesting thing is that it feeds on <B><I>Escherichia coli</I></B>. Its “favorite” strain is OP50, although we checked that it’s also able to
  feed on <B>XL1-Blue strain</B>, the one that we used in all our molecular biology experiments.
</P><P>
  Some advantages of C. elegans when compared with other model organisms are:
</P><UL style="list-style: url('https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/b/b9/Vlc_biocampus-bullet_list-small.png');display:block;width:420px;padding-left:50px;padding-right:40px;float:left;"><LI> 
     Lifespan ranges between 2 and 3 weeks, so experimentation times are reduced.
</LI><LI>
     Its maintenance and study is cheap and simple (it is transparent, which facilitates microscopic observation).
</LI><LI>
     It is very small (1 mm), so it is possible to carry out experiments with a huge number of worms in a small Petri dish having a great statistical support.
</LI></UL><H2>Why use <I>C. elegans</I> as a transport?</H2><P>
  When we were considering on creating a new system for the transport of bacteria, we found different key advantages that made the nematode the best option.
  For example, <I>C. elegans</I> is able to move very fast around solid substrates (soil actually is its natural habitat) and also in agar, so it’s very
  useful for both lab experiments and real-environment tests.
</P><P>
  Its movement, in addition to being very fast, has two modes: <B>random </B>and <B>directed.</B></P><P>
When there is no attractant in the medium, <I>C. elegans</I> moves doing uncoordinated movements in several directions in what is known as  <B>'random walk'.</B></P><P>
  The situation changes when there is an attractant in the medium. Here, our 'transport system' begins to direct its movements to the focus of the substance
  (volatile or soluble) which acts as an attractant in a process known as <B>'chemotaxis'</B> thanks to the amazing sense of smell of our nematode. This allows us to
  ‘guide’ the nematodes <B>towards defined spots in irregular substrates.</B></P><P>
Chemotaxis is the foundation to guide the transport of bacteria and is therefore the focus of experimentation with <I>C. elegans</I>, with <B>the aim of finding the best attractant.</B> This ability makes <I>C. elegans </I>a perfect 'bus' for bacteria.  <B>(<A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Simuelegans-Chemotaxis">simuelegans online here</A>)</B></P><P>
  Moreover, we found two pathogens (<I>Yersinia pestis</I> and <I>Xhenorhabus nematophila</I>) with the ability to form biofilms on <I>C. elegans</I> thanks
to the proteins of the <B>operon hmsHFRS.</B> When genetically-engineered strains of commonly used bacteria such as <I>Escherichia coli</I> or  <I>Pseudomonas</I><I>putida</I> express this hmsHFRS operon, they have the 'ticket' to travel: they are able to adhere to the worm’s surface by means of
  forming a synthetic biofilm.
</P><H2>Expanding our knowledge about <I>C. elegans</I>...</H2><P>
  Once we knew that <I>C. elegans</I> was the best option, we began to discover interesting things for further study.
</P><P>
  There are several strains of our nematode. The one that drew our attention was called 'N2', which had a fairly interesting behaviour: under normal
  conditions, it eats individually, whereas under certain conditions (such as starvation), a social feeding behaviour known as <B>“clumping”</B> is induced.
But this phenomenon can also be induced if the expression of some particular genes is interfered. This fact gave us the opportunity to develop the  <B>first artificial symbiosis between worms and bacteria</B>, based on the manipulation of the behaviour of <I>C. elegans</I> by simply nourishing it with
  transformed <I>E.coli </I>able to synthesize the iRNA.
</P><P><B>With it, while<I> C. elegans </I>acts as transport, bacteria return the favour giving it the ability to eat in company. </B></P></DIV><DIV class="tab-pane fade" id="Results"><P>
