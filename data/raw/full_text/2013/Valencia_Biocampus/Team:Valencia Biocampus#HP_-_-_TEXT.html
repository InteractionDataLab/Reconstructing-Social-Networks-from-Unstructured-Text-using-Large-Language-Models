It (Ten tales of Synthetic Biology) is a great way for students to think about broader implications of technology in practice and about how technology assessment can move beyond a narrow consideration of health and safety risks.

Human Practices
Responsible Research and Innovation
Science must be useful to society. Reciprocally, Human Practices approaches should serve scientists, who should not see it as just biosafety warnings,     legal limitations or research obstacles. Responsible Research and Innovation deals with Science as a part of the Society, with which a transparent and fruitful feedback is set. We committed to apply such transparency in our project; in our honest notebook ; in the form of the biosafety form ; a TV-like iGEM news in youtube; and in our wiki.
We have studied all the available bibliography on RRI and prepared the first Report on RRI and Synthetic Biology with a focus on iGEM . We discuss     what is RRI, how it relates to new technologies such SB, and why the iGEM competition should pay attention to this brand new way of applying Human     Practices to research: with an integrative and positive perspective.
Ten Tales on Synthetic Biology
Once imbibed in RRI, we decided to make an experiment with ourselves: the team was divided in two groups of five students each, and each group was randomly     assigned a very optimistic or a very pessimistic view on Synthetic Biology. This yielded our dual book with both the bright and dark side of this     new discipline, not unlike R.L. Stevenson “Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde”... We asked an enthusiast of SB, Robert Carlson, to write one of the prefaces, while     Kathy Jo Wetter, a member of the ECT group, wrote the other.

Biosafety
Safety issues are –or should be- one of the most important parts in each project. Valencia Biocampus team, concerned with that, worked on several aspects     of it. We filled up the Basic Safety Form, a second Biosafety Form and we answered the four interesting biosafety questions.

Responsible Research and Innovation Report
Innovations are global in reach and potential. They are the source of considerable competitive advantages.  The challenge of RRI is achieving a balance between innovation and growth with the need for effective, safe and appropriate products.
Going deeper into the iGEM contest we wanted to enhance how different teams from all over the world during these almost 10 years of competition have dealt with the six fundamental keys of RRI. To know more download our RRI report .

Transparency: iGEM News
The iGEM News were conceived as a transparency exercise that our team wanted to do in order to show how our lab journeys were. In our Youtube channel we told our viewers about the development of the project, the results, the collaboration with other teams, we showed them the picture of the day from our Instagram account and some sketches to make our followers feel closer to us. We thought that these iGEM News were the most original and enjoyable way of showing the effort that our team was doing to make our synthetic symbiosis possible.  Also, we thought that the best way to get in touch with people was to make them understand that they could help young scientists like us through our crowdfunding campaign. We made a video in which we told them about our project and about how important Science is in our lives and the possibilities that Synthetic Biology can offer.

Responsible Research and Innovation
Beyond our report on Responsible Research and Innovation, the book and our transparency activities, we decided to go one step further: we have chosen eight flagship publications on Synthetic Biology and we have subjected them to the "RRI TEST”. Here you can see our results .

Ten Tales on Synthetic Biology
We have written a book, "Ten Tales on Synthetic Biology", in which we aim to show an utopic point of view but also a catastrophic one. With that, we want to make people aware that the best option would be to do responsible research.
