Achievements
• We achieved the first synthetic transport system for bacteria through an artificial association with worms.
• We altered worms' behaviour through the controlled expression of an iRNA .
• We characterized and sent to the Registry biobrick original parts, including bioplastic-producing genes; the first synthetic symbiosis biofilm-based part; and the first Biobrick yielding an altered behavior of an eukaryotic organism: BBa_K1112000 , BBa_K1112001 , and BBa_K1112002 .
• We built our own scanner and designed an image-analysis software , C++elegans, in order to detect nutrient-rich hotspots in heterogeneous substrates.
• We modeled the system in increasing complexity levels.
• We designed, performed and analyzed our work in the context of a RRI framework . We also wrote “Ten tales on Synthetic Biology” , a book of short stories showing five negative and five positive dream visions on SB.
• We collaborated with the Norwich , Purdue ("Characterization collaboration"), Copenhaguen ("Bricks of knowledge") and UC Chile (promoting "Research" the game) teams.
• We performed a successful pre-field validation test .
• And we did all this with one of the pillars of Responsible Research and Innovation: transparency.
