We would like to thank all of the academics, PhD students, visitors and staff members who have made this project possible. Their willingness to give us their time, their help and their valuable opinions have not only made this summer far easier, but has made the iGEM experience utterly memorable and enjoyable!
Dr. Lizzy Dridge : Dr Lizzy Dridge coordinated the Exeter iGEM team for the entire summer. She offered guidance and assistance throughout the initial conception of our project, the lab work, and all of the administrative aspects. You have been amazing. Wholeheartedly, thank you.
Dr. Paul James : Dr Paul James helped the team tremendously with the Gibson Assembly of the G-blocks to make the Green light module and the GFP output brick. He also helped with all general lab queries for the duration of our project. You have helped this project run as smoothly as it ever could have gone. Thank you for all of your time, we so appreciate it.
Dr. John Love : Dr. John Love has given us a wealth of information and assistance with the planning and undertaking of the project. His overhaul of our initial construct designs was, at first, terrifying, but has definitely paid off! His enthusiasm and obvious interest in the project has been an inspiration to the team, and has often given us the much-needed boost we needed. We really hope it was sexy enough for you.
Dr. Nic Harmer : Dr Nick Harmer was kind enough to give a lecture to aid our early thought processes. He also agreed to meet with us on various occasions to check our constructs and aid us with any queries we had.
Dr. Clive Butler : Dr Clive Butler kindly gave a lecture on synthetic biology to aid our early thought processes. He also met with us regularly to discuss our ideas and offer advice.
Clio Andreae : Clio Andreae helped us hugely in the lab, advising us with 3a assembly and many other lab techniques including; mini prepping, centrifuging, making agarose gels and transformations. We are sorry for stealing your pipettes and lighter. Thank you for everything.
Victoria Baldwin : Victoria Baldwin gave us various enzymes, samples and solutions and helped us hugely with our 3a assembly method. Victoria also offered us a great deal of help and advice with the lab work.
Dr. George Littlejohn : George littlejohn gave us a lecture at the beginning of the summer when we were still brainstorming ideas. He also gave us regular advice and guidance with queries to do with our project.
Professor Rob Beardmore : Professor Beardmore gave a great lecture on modelling and helped with the modelling throughout the project to check everything was working correctly, give advice and answer any questions.
Dr. Tom Howard : Dr Tom Howard kindly gave a lecture early on in our thought progression and brainstorming. Tom lead the 2012 iGEM team so gave insight into last years experience and offered his support whenever we had questions.
Gwen Batten : Gwen is the laboratory manager. She supervised us in the labs and showed us how to undertake various lab protocols carefully and safely. She was our first port of call whenever we had lab based queries.
Professor C Peter Winlove : Professor C Peter Winlove is a professor of Biophysics in the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences. He met with several team members on multiple occasions to discuss the project in great detail. He highlighted certain areas that we needed to be wary of, but was generally very positive about our project. He offered a lot of guidance to the students involved in modelling our systems.
Dr. Helen Featherstone : Dr. Helen Featherstone hosted two fantastic discussion sessions with the entire team to give structure and planning to our Outreach. She inspired us to choose option that are probably not well recognised within iGEM, and even gave us contacts to various people both within and outside of the University who could help us achieve our aims.
Dr. Nicola King : Dr. Nicola King kindly organised our talk to a group of 6th form students.
Dr. Christine Sambles : Dr. Christine Sambles gave a lecture on The 'Omics and spoke to us early on in the project to cover some aspects of Biology and Chemistry that our Physicists and Electrical Engineer may not be quite comfortable with; the 'Omics that formed the backbone of our project.
Dr. Matthew Baker : Dr. Matthew Baker met with several team members to discuss the impact our project would have on the University of Exeter and the wider community. He gave us advice on how we should best present our ideas to the public.
Dr. Janet Cotter : Dr. Janet Cotter spoke to us very early on in our planning to ensure that we considered the ethics of our project, and that we wouldn't be undertaking a project that would hold risks to the environment. She left a strong message about our responsibilities as a team which we tried to uphold throughout the summer, and encouraged us to think about aspects of our project that we had otherwise not considered.
Sponsors
Our team has received generous funding from the University of Exeter's annual fund and microbial biofuels group . In addition, we wish to thank Thermo Scientific for their kind donation of a surplus of lab consumables, without which we could not have completed our project. IDT , in addition to making our G-blocks, offered greatly appreciated advice on the sequences we asked for them to build.
