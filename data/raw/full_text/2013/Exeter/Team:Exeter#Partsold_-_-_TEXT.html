This page will document the parts that Exeter iGEM 2013 submit to the biobrick registry.
Our aim is to submit a composite biobrick for E. coli which will allow control three genes of your choice using Red, Green and Blue ( RGB ) light. We will also submit the three constituent bio-bricks for each light input. See our project section for details about our bio-bricks.
We plan to extensively characterise our system and provide a mathematical model of our system for quantative control of outputs. See our modelling section .

Cyan pigment, version two
BBa_K864404
Cyan pigment, version two, includes a promoter and RBS
BBa_K592022
Cyan pigment, version two, includes a alternative promoter and RBS
BBa_K592004
YF1 blue light sensor
BBa_K592005
FixJ, the protein which communicates between the blue light sensor and the yellow pigment gene
BBa_K592006
FixJ specific promoter, only allows transcription when FixJ-P is present
BBa_K592010
Yellow pigment, version one
BBa_S05058
Yellow pigment, version one, with added RBS
BBa_K592001
CcaS green light sensor
BBa_K592002
CcaR, the protein which communicates between the green light sensor and the lambda inverter system
BBa_K592017
Combined CcaS and CcaR with RBS before each
BBa_K592003
CcaR specific promoter, only allows transcription when CcaR-P is NOT present
BBa_K592012
Magenta pigment
BBa_KJ04450
RFP control, but can potentially act as a magenta pigment
