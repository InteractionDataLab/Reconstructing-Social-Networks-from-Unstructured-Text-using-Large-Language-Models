This page will document the parts that Exeter iGEM 2013 submit to the biobrick registry.
Our aim is to submit a composite biobrick for E. coli which will allow control three genes of your choice using red, green and blue ( RGB ) light. We have successful sent in the composite part for the green light module ( [1] ). We also aim to create constituent bio-bricks for red/blue/green light input matching cyan/yellow/magenta pigments respectively. We have managed to submit a brick for the red light module (includes the cyan pigment, see [2] ). We will also submit a constituent bio-brick for red light input with cut sites to allow input of your favourite gene ( [3] ). See our project section for details about our bio-bricks.
We plan to extensively characterise our system and provide a mathematical model of our system for quantative control of outputs. See our modelling section .
