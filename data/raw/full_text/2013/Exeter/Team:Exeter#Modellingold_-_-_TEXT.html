Introduction
We aim to produce an extensive model that predicts the behavior of our system. The purpose of this model is to numerically characterize our bio-bricks for future use.
The model will focus on the rates of the reactions in our pathways and how light interacts with both the sensors and pigments. The final model will predict what colour and tone a bacteria will be given light exposure.
The Team
We are Exeter iGEM's dry team. Together we are responsible for the creation and development of a working model of our system

The Model
Assumptions
Due to the complexity of biological systems our model will include but not be limited to the following assumptions:
Classical elastic mechanics
Bacteria contain a homogeneous mix of components
All constituents move with brownian motion
Bacteria are identical
Bacteria evenly distributed across surface
Bacteria do not interact
Only pathway specific species are rate limiting
The Plan
The chemistry of our pathways are to be mapped out in detail.
We will research what relevant models exist and make use of the most accurate.
We shall construct rudimentary equations for each step in our pathways.
Throughout the project our model will be updated either in light of experimental results or new ideas.
Modelling Software
The majority of our modelling efforts will be focused on creating a system of rules for the protein interaction programming language Kappa . Using Kappa we will be able to create a stochastic model, which will take experimentally determined reaction rates and provide an accurate prediction of the bacteria's reaction to light exposure.
