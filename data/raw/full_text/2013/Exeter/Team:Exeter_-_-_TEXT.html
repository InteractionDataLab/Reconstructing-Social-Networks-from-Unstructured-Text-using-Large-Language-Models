Creating the World's First Full Colour Biocamera
Exeter iGEM 2013 are a team comprising of 11 second year undergraduates from the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences and the College of Life and Environmental Sciences. Together we plan to engineer E. coli to detect red, green and blue light and produce the correct mix of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments to accurately recreate an exposed image. Our project aims to build a foundation for the precise optical control of biological systems using multiple wavelength light. This has potential in material manufacturing, imaging and will advance our understanding of synthetic biology as a whole.
