About the University of Exeter
The University of Exeter is situated in Devon, England, in the beautiful city of Exeter. We are regarded as being in the top one percent of Universities in the world, with over 18,000 students from 130 different countries across the world studying on one of three campuses across the South West. We were recently named “Sunday Times University of the Year 2013”, and joined the Russell Group in 2012 to join such Universities as the University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh and the University of Oxford. Our team is made up of students from the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, both based on the picturesque Streatham Campus.  The University undertakes a variety of world-class research in an array of different subjects, ranging from extrasolar planets to international relations. The University has announced its plans to build a £50 million multi-disciplinary research centre at the heart of the Streatham Campus to look at systems biology and address issues including food security, environmental sustainability and systems medicine. .
