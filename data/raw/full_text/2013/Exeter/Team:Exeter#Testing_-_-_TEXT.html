Exeter iGEM 2013
Exeter iGEM 2013 are a team comprising of 11 second year undergraduates from the colleges of Engineering, Physics and Biological sciences. Together we plan to engineer E. coli to detect red, green and blue light and produce the correct mix of cyan, magenta and yellow pigments to accurately recreate an exposed image. Our project aims to build a foundation for the precise optical control of biological systems using multiple wavelength light. This has potential in material manufacturing, imaging and will advance our understanding of synthetic biology as a whole.
Our wiki is currently in development, if you have any questions for our team, please email igem@ex.ac.uk
