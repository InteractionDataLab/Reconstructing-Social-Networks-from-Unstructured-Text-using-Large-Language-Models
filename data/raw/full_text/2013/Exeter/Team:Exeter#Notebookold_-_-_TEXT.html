Fran
Coughed on one of our plates that we had transformed after a ligation to see if she had a throat infection. We (Beth) got excited when something grew as we thought maybe this one ligation had worked. It had not. Not to mention, we took three liquid cultures from "Fran's cough". Three.
Beth
Dropped a beaker whilst washing it and smashed it
Rachel
Dropped all the petri dishes. Twice.
Boiled over the agar in the microwave.
Stabbed through the plastic of an agar plate with her fingers.
Boiled over the agar in the microwave again.
Flick
Left columns in at end of miniprep and left out on a 30°C bench so all the stuff in the column was released into our plasmid solution

Put stuff in fridge to incubate at 37°C
