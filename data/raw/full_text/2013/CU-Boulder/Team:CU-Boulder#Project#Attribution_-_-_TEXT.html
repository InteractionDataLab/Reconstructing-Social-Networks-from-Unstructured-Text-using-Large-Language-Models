We could like to thank the following people for all their hard work and help.
We would like to thank the following labs for donating lab space and usage of equipment for these experiments.
Copley Lab
Garcia Lab
Dowell Lab
Thanks to all of our advisors
These people did a lot to show us how to use the equipment safely, how to perform the various protocols we needed, where to look for information and all the support services like ordering DNA sequences from IDT.

DNA order optimization and ordering
Most of our parts had to be created by IDT in 500 bp blocks that were then gibson assembled.
Joe Rokicki: Thanks for ordering the gblocks, designing how the blocks would be assembled along with head and tail sequences and doing a huge amount of work in checking the accuracy of the order and labeling all the features.
William Heymann: For writing the MATLAB code used to figure out the sequences that would go in each block to make sure that each piece spanned as few pieces as possible and for codon optimizing all the sequences.
In order to create this order we used the following pieces of software and we wish to thank the creators
MATLAB: The global optimizer is a truly amazing tool
Gene Designer: This tool proved to be very useful for codon optimization and the company was very helpful
UGENE: We used this program to identify the features in all of our sequences and to later verify all the parts we sent off for sequencing.
Researching and finding the correct sequences to order
This is something that all of the students and faculty advisors worked on pretty equally. We found these sequences before we started any of the lab work over the summer.
Thanks to the following people for checking the DNA sequence and AA sequences (after they where codon optimized) in order to ensure order accuracy.

Keeping track of all of our parts
Phil Jensen: Thanks for setting up the spreadsheets for keeping track of all of our parts, where they were and what resistance they were on.
