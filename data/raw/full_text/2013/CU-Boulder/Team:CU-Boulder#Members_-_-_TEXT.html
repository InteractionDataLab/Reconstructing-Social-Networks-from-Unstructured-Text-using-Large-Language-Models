Advisor: Robin Dowell D.Sc
The Dowell Lab focuses on developing informative, mechanistic models that unravel biologically meaningful information from a few individuals and limited reference information. We leverage comparative information to better understand both the diverse roles that non-coding transcripts play within the cell and the impact of variation on phenotype between closely related individuals.
Graduate Student Advisor: Joe Rokicki
Joe earned a BSE in Electrical Engineering at Princeton in 2008.  He became involved in iGEM as a member of the 2007 Edinburgh iGEM team (self flavoring yogurt).  He went on to volunteer as staff at the iGEM jamboree @ MIT in 2009 and 2010.  In 2011 he started the first iGEM team at CU-Boulder where he is currently in his 5th year in the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology doctoral program.
Graduate Student Advisor: Mike Brasino
Michael Brasino is a graduate student in the newly formed materials science program and a past student on the 2011 Washington iGEM team.  Michael is new to Boulder, having moved from San Diego only a year ago.

Elijah Lovelace
Eli is a senior double majoring in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. His interest are in cell biology, nutritional biology and bioinformatics. In his free time, Eli enjoys skiing, hiking, camping, fly fishing and playing guitar. After graduation Eli hopes to go to law school and become a patent attorney in the biotech field. Eli is looking forward to watching Peyton Manning and Broncos win the Super Bowl. (Definitely not the Seahawks)

Sarah Zimmerman
Sarah is a junior in the MCDB program at CU Boulder with an interest in both oncogenic research and scientific education.  When she’s not in the lab, Sarah can be found “nerding” it up with old Farscape reruns or wasting countless hours yelling at Payday 2. She can be contacted at: sarah.zimmermann@colorado.edu
Josephina Hendrix
Josephina is a sophomore in the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology program at CU Boulder. She works in the Dowell lab and is interested in methods of gene regulation, chromatin structuring, and synthetic biology. She enjoys photography and writing in her spare time.
