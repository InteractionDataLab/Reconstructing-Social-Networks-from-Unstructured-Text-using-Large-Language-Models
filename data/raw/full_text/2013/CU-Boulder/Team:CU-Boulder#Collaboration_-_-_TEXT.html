Collaboration with UCL_E
We collaborated with Bethan Wolfenden and the University College London Entrepreneurial team to help integrate some of the work we have done.  They are developing a tool kit to make synthetic biology more available to high school students, and were interested in several of the protocols we developed this summer.  They have an amazing project which we were happy to be a part of, and it was awesome to exchange ideas about improving the accessibility of synthetic biology with a team with similar goals.
