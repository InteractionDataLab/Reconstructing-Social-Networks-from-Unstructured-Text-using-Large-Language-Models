Happy 4th of July!
Happy 4th of July!!  This flag was streaked out this summer using intermediate constructs created throughout the course of our project. We used wild type E. coli (white), pSB1C3 expressing a dsRed derivative (red), and an AmilCP (blue) expressing part we constructed from the chromoprotein submitted by the 2011 Uppsala team.
