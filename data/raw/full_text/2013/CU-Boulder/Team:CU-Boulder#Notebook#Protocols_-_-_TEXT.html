Embedding PDF Files
In this protocol we cover how to embed a PDF on the iGEM team wiki pages. We also cover some of the additional CSS you will need in order to put this on your own site.
Embedding Google Docs
Here we cover how to embed a google document on the iGEM wiki. This is very useful during development since the document will continuously update and you can just convert it to a PDF at the end for a final version.
Chemically Competent Cells
This protocol details how to prepare chemically competent cells.

Restriction (Double) Digests
Our method of performing restriction double digests is detailed in this protocol.
Gel Purification of DNA
Here we detail a fast and simple method of purifying DNA from a gel.
Ligation Reactions
This protocol covers how we set up out ligation reactions.
Homemade Buffer Compositions
The composition of the buffers used in our homemade miniprep system, mini-column recycling protocol, and cell lysis for protein extraction are given in this protocol.
