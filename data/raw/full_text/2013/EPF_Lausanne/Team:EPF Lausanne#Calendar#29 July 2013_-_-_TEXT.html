PCR optimisation
The previous PCR we did to amplify pINP_construct was not optimal. We thus did another gradient PCR of the same plasmid with 5% DMSO at 74°C, 76°C and 78°C. A 0.8% Electrophoresis gel was performed to verify the reation's products.

Making Nanoparticles, 1st try
We added the cargo molecule (food dye) to GPs and left them for stirring (during 3 days).
