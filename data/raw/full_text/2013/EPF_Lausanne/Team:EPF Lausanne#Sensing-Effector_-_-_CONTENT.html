Once this promoter senses the signal, it would initiate transcription of an enzyme which degrades the nanoparticle, thus releasing its contents.
We decided to use pH as the specific trigger that activates the promoter. As a proof of principle, we inserted three different promoters into three plasmids in front of the BioBrick BBa_I746916 (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I746908" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I746916, Main Page</A>) which encodes superfolded GFP. Then, we transformed cells with these plasmids and let them grow in media with different pHs in order to check the expression.

Then, each of the constructs was used to transform DH5-alpha competent cells, which were first plated on chloramphenicol containing LB agar plates for selection of positive transformants, and then incubated into media with different pHs.

1.) LB-Chloramphenicol with a final pH of 5 (Adjusted with 10X MOPS+HCl) 
2.) LB-Chloramphenicol with a final pH of 6 (Adjusted with 10X MOPS)

4.) LB-Chloramphenicol with a final pH of 8.5 (with 10X HEPES)</P><P>For each medium, we measured the OD of the cells. This helped us establish whether a low expression of GFP was really due to the fact that the promoters did not work, or simply resulting from the cells dying before they could initiate transcription and translation of the protein. It would also tell us whether an increase of fluorescence was only due to an accumulation of bacteria or to the actual accumulation of GFP.

We overexposed some of the images to be sure that there was no fluorescence in the bacteria in these media.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Expected_outcome">Expected outcome</SPAN></H2><P>The promoters Hya and Cad were supposed to initiate transcription upon external acidification, which would then cause the bacteria to express superfolded GFP and turn bright green. The biobrick BBa_J23119, being a constitutive promoter, would turn the bacteria green independently of their medium.
For our project, the promoters were inserted in front of a gelatinase so that the later would be expressed upon arrival in an acidic medium. The bacterium would then secrete the gelatinase causing the degradation of the nanoparticle and the release of its contents.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results">Results</SPAN></H2><P>We successfully managed to PCR amplify each of the three promoters as well as to insert them by Gibson Assembly into the pSB1C3 plasmid so that they would control the expression of superfolded GFP. These assemblies were all successful, which was determined by sequencing the plasmid isolated from the positive transformants on the plate. This sequencing result showed a 100% match between the reference promoter sequence and the inserted sequence that the bacteria contained.
Also, the bacteria containing the biobrick promoter turned green on the plates as well as in liquid culture, as expected.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion">Discussion</SPAN></H2><P><B>GFP expression under the hya and the cad promoters</B>
From the measurements we made on the plate reader, we were not able to conclude whether the promoters are really induced at low pH as the cells died very quickly. This was also supported by the OD measurements we took. On those graphs one can see very clearly that the cells which are in the acidic media die almost immediately. Furthermore, there was some expression in both the neutral and the basic medium. This would indicate that the promoter is either a constitutive promoter or that it is inducible but leaky. 
Comparing these graphs with the microscopy pictures, one cannot say conclusively that the promoter is inducible by pH. Even though under the microscope there are only fluorescent bacteria at acidic pH, the results from the plate reader clearly indicate that there are also fluorescent bacteria at neutral and high pH. However, one can see a trend that for both the hya and the cad promoter, the fluorescence is strongest at acidic pH and weakest at basic pH under the microscope. This trend cannot be seen in the Plate Reader measurements, as the bacteria at low pH die before being able to express GFP. 
Using the constitutive promoter as a positive control one can see that both hya and cad are weak promoters, as the fluorescence in the bacteria with the constitutive promoter is much stronger in acidic, neutral and basic media than the fluorescence in bacteria containing the hya or the cad promoter. Furthermore, a comparison with the constitutive promoter again supports the hypothesis that the bacteria grow best at neutral pH, as there are much more bacteria at pH 7 and at pH 6.5 or 8.5. <B>Conclusion</B>
Thus, we can conclude that the hya promoter and the cad promoter work, in the sense that they in fact induce expression of GFP. But from our data, we were not able to conclusively say that they are inducible by low pH.
Nevertheless, we were able to show that they are weak promoters that can be used to express a protein that should be present at low concentrations.
</P><P><B>With respect to our project</B>
In order to be sure that hya and cad are induced only at low pH, we would need to do further testing. As soon as their inducibility would be confirmed, we would insert them by gibson assembly in front of either GelE gelatinase or MMP2 gelatinase. Upon arrival in a medium with pH below 7 the enzyme would be synthesized and released.

The three other constructs that were not supposed to have GFP after the gelatinase gene were not done, as the result would have been the same. 
The assembly worked for both the GelE and MMP2 constructs, but not for MMP9.</P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 40: Gibson Assembly: GelE-GFP construct</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 41: Gibson Assembly: MMP2-GFP construct</DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transformation.2C_control_PCR_and_sequencing">Transformation, control PCR and sequencing</SPAN></H2><P>We then transformed bacteria with the two constructs.

We also incubated the positive transformants with arabinose and looked at them under the microscope. As expected they did not express GFP.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Western_Blot">Western Blot</SPAN></H2><P>The next assay to test the expression and secretion of our proteins was a Western Blot, performed on the supernatant and cell lysate fractions of our liquid cell culture. The antibody used to detect our protein was an anti-His tag antibody, which was supposed to detect the His-tag that had been added to the CDS of our proteins. This assay unfortunately came out negative. We were unable to check for the presence of the His tag with the sequencing because the primers we used to do it did not initiate sequencing at the beginning of the protein as the sequencing starts a bit downstream of the primer binding site. The sequencing of the middle sequence showed a 97%-98% match between the insert and the reference sequence.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Protein_purification_and_SDS-PAGE">Protein purification and SDS-PAGE</SPAN></H2><P>A protein purification method under native conditions using a Ni-NTA spin kit was performed. The native conditions were chosen because we wanted to perform a digestion assay with the purified protein on the nanoparticles to assess their digestion capacities. 
The lysates, flow-through, wash and final eluate (supposed to contain the purified protein) were kept and analyzed with a NanoDrop before being used for an SDS-PAGE. The NanoDrop revealed that the eluates contained no protein, but that the wash fraction contained about 0.4 mg/ml of protein. Possible reasons for this were: 
1) the His tag was not properly added to the protein CDS 
2) the His tag was hidden in the protein structure and could not bind to the column since the purification was done under native conditions
3.) As the Kit was left at room temperature it is possible that the binding columns were defective 
When we did the SDS Page did not work due to a Coomassie stain issue.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion_and_Future">Discussion and Future</SPAN></H2><P>We unfortunately could not come to a satisfying final result in the effecting part of the project because we could not prove that the plasmids actually conferred to the bacteria the ability to secrete a gelatin-degrading protein. We can later perform the digestion assay with the wash fraction of the Ni-NTA purification to see whether a gelatin-degrading protein is indeed present in it. Also, the next experiment would be to redo the SDS-PAGE on the remains of the Ni-NTA purification.
