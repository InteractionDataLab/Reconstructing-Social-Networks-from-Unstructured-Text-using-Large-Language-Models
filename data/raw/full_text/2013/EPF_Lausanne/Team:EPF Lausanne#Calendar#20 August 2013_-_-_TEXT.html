Gibson Assembly
- We did the streptavidin alive gibson assembly reaction (NEB protocol).
- Verification of the gibson reaction with a 0.8% gel electrophoresis.
- Gibson Assembly probably didn't work.
Sensing-Effector
Gradient PCR of Backbones
-To check which annealing temperature is ideal for our backbone amplification we did a gradient PCR. None of the temperatures seemed to work. Furthermore, the band that we get is still not at the right size.
Nanoparicles
Making Nanoparticles, 2nd try
- Biotinylation of the new nanoparticles.
- Dialysis of biotinylated nanoparticles.
