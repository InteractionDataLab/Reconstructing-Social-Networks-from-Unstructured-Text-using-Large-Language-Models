Sensing-Effector
Isolation of genomic MG1655 DNA
-We followed the manufactures instruction from the DNa isolation kit we received in order to isolate the genomic DNA. The yields were within the expected Range, from 120ng/ul-300ng/ul.
Sensing/Nanoparticles
Digestion of nanoparticles
-We did one more measurement of the solution containing our nanoparticles and MMP2. The result showed that the Nanoparticles were still the same size.
- We did a second try for the digestion with MMP2: only with the Tris buffer, but with a higher concentration of MMP2
- Three measurements were done for the second try: the nanoparticles got smaller with MMP2, more clearly than during the first try
