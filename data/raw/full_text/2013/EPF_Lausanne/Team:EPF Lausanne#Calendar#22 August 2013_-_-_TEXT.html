Cell Surface Display
Transformation didn't work so it was repeated.
Sensing-Effector
Gradient PCR of Sensing Backbones
-We did another gradient PCR for the backbones but for the three sensing constructs in order to check if the problem in the previous pcr were the primers or actually the plasmid. Again, it did not work.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 2nd try
-Affinity purification of biotinylated nanoparticles with Streptavidin Magnetic Particles. Measurement of the products with DLS.
-ELISA-like assay in order to detect the presence of biotin.
