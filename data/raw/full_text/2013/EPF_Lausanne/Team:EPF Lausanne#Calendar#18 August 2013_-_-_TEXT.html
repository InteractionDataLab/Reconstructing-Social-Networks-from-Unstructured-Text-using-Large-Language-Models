PCR of MMP2 and MMP9 inserts and Backbones
-We did the same PCR as the previous day. It again did not work neither for the inserts nor for the Backbones. For the inserts there was no visible amplification and for the Backbones there was no difference between the backbones with and without GFP. So we decided to re run a gel the next day at a lower voltage just for the backbones.
