Functional Assays
- Preparation of the samples inoculated the day before for immunostaining and biotin staining.
- Samples visualization with and inverted microscope using FITC filter.
- The cells images and pattern were better for the biotin assay. We had nothing with the antibody.
Sensing-Effector
OD measurements
-I let the bacteria with the three promoters hya, cad and constitutive grow in media with different pHs. Each 45-70 minutes I measured the OD in order to see if the absence of GFP expression in the plate reader was due to non- induction of the promoter or the simple fact that the bacteria were dying at ceratin pH values.  Indeed this experiments showed, that the bacteria in the acidic milieu died very quickly which could explained why the promoter was never induced.
