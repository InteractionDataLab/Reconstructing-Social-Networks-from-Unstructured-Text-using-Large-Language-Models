Sensing-Effector
Suspending Primers
-Our new primers arrived and we resuspended them and made primer mixes for each pair, one forward and one reverse.
Inducing and measuring GFP expression
-The AraC-GFP containing bacteria were made to express GFP by adding 1% of 20% L-Arabinose. After adding the Arabinose we incubated them for 2.5h at 37°C and then looked at them in the microscope. They clearly fluoresce, indicating that GFP is expressed induced by addition of Arabinose to the medium.
PCR of Backbones
-We tried to amplify the backbones of the sensing and effector constructs by using the new primers. It did not work.
