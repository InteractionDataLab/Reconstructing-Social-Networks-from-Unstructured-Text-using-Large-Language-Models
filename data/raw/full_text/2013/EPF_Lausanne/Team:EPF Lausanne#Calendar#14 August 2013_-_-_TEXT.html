BBa_K523013 Characterisation
Characterisation of the iGEM plasmid BBa_K523013 we decided to use.
Sensing-Effector
Amplifying Plasmids containing gelatinases
-We transformed two cultures each with a plasmid containing a gene that encoded either MMP2 or MMP9 (two gelatinases).
Streaking Stabculture
-Along with the plasmids we received a stabculture already transformed with the two enzyme-plasmids. We streaked these cultures on LB+Ampicillin plates and let them grow over night.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 2nd try
-We used a new protocol.
