Streptavidin Dead Cloning
-Miniprep of pET21a Streptavidin Dead cells inoculated the day before.
-PCR of pET21a Streptavidn Dead to amplify the Streptavidin sequence. The reaction was at 66°C, 68°C and 70°C without DMSO.
-We did a 0.8% electrophoresis gel to verify the reaction.
-As the gel result was good we did a larger amount (50µl) PCR at 68°C.
-We did another Gel to check the product.
-We did a PCR purification (Qiagen protocol) of the streptavidin dead obtained. We measured the Concentration at the nanodrop.
