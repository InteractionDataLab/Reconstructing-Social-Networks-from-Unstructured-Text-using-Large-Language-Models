Sensing-Effector
PCR of the effector Backbones and the effector insert MMP2 and MMP9 without GFP
-I did a 50ul PCR reaction of the Backbone and insert of the effector constructs. I again used a program where the first ten cycles are 10C° bellow the normal annealing temperature. The Gel electrophoresis showed that there was some sort of contamination, probably in the Primer Mixes. So I did the primer mixes again.
