Sensing-Effector
Gel electrophoresis of the backbones with and without GFP
-After running the gel for 1.5h, there were two visible bands for the backbones but not at the right height. We were not sure if there was a problem with the ladder.
Gradient PCR of inserts
-As we were not sure about the annealing temperatures of the primers for the MMP inserts, we ran a gradient PCR for the MMP2 and MMP9 inserts with 8 different temperatures between 56°C and 65°C. This Gradient PCR worked very well, the inserts were amplified at almost all of the temperatures.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 2nd try
-Addition of bromophenol blue to the new nanoparticles to try and load them. The addition seems not to be working, since the solution precipitated.
