Cell Surface Display
Research for the confocal microscopy.
Research of protocols for biotin fluorescent staining next for other functional assays.
Sensing-Effector
Purification of PCR products of the three sensing constructs
-I purified the PCR products from the previous Day and the concentrations were within an acceptable range. Since I had not yet amplified the constitutive promoter from iGEM I put the purified Backbone for this promoter into the refrigerator for late use.
DpnI digest of the two pH sensitive promoters and their backbones
-I did a DpnI digest and measured the concentrations again, they were all around 50ng/ul which is good.
Gibson assembly of the two constructs with the hya and the cad promoter (pH-sensors)
-I did a Gibson assembly of both sensing constructs but it did not work for the one with the hya promoter, so I did another Restriction digest of the purified PCR products for this promoter.
PCR of the MMP2 insert and its Backbone and the MMP9 Backbone
-We did a PCR of the backbones for both MMP2 and MMP9 as well as of the insert MMP2. The Gel showed that it worked.
