Sensing-Effector
Measuring GFP expression with a plate reader
-Again we let the bacteria with the three different promoters grow in media with different pHs. Only the constitutive promoter had a very strong GFP expression, which was as expected, since it served as positive control. But again neither the hya nor the cad promoters seemed to be induced. Furthermore, the bacteria in the acidic pH (at 5.5) died very quickly.
