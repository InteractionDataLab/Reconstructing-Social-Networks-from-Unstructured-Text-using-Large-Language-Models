Transformation
Transformation of DH5alpha competent cells with the streptavidin alive gibson potentially non working product.
Sensing-Effector
Transformation of Bacteria
-We did another transformation:
1.) Two plates with the AraC promoter containing Plasmid, directly taken from the Kit stock
2.) Two plates with the pH promoter, directly taken from the Kit stock
3.) Two plates with another plasmid with only the pBAd promoter
4.) Two plates as a transformation efficiency control with the puc19 plasmid
5.) Two plates as a negative control with untransformed bacteria on chloramphenicol plates
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 2nd try
-We finished the dialysis of the biotinylated nanoparticles. Looks good; the solution is white.
