New Strategy
Beginning of PCR using the new primers designed to amplify the different component that will be needed to clone the following constructs : INP_YFP_Streptavidin and INP_streptavidin_YFP.
Sensing-Effector
Making Buffers for the functional Assays
-In order to test the sensing module I wanted to let the bacteria grow in media with different pHs. So I made a 10XMOPS buffer and a 10XHEPES buffer.
GFP expression in the constitutive promoter
-The cells that contained the constitutive promoter in front of GFP had turned bright green over night. This showed that this biobrick was functional and worked exactly the way it was supposed to. Also, the hya and the cad promoter had not turned on the expression of GFP so I concluded that they are not constitutive, or that they have a mutation.
Inducing GFP expression of the hya and the cad promoter
-I tried to let the bacteria with the hya and the cad promoter grow in media with acidic pH, since it is at pH 5.5 that these promoters are most active. But the cultures did not turn green.
