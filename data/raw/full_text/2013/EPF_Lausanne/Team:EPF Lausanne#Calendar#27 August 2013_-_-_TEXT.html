Cell Surface Display
Working samples were sent for sequencing from their miniprep with VR primers.
Beginning of functional assays
INP_Streptavidin Dead and iGEM overnight inoculation (LB + chloramphenicol) and DH5alpha competent cells from glycerol stocks plates.
Sensing-Effector
Primer design
-We desinged new primers for the three sensing construct as well as for the three effector constructs. This time we were very careful to make sure that both the forward and reverse primer had almost the same annealing temperature and that this temperature was not too high.
