Our team is this year exceptionally composed of 10 young women. We are all very motivated and proud to participate in the 2013 iGEM competition.  We all were Bachelor's students at the beginning of the project. Still, we participated in every aspect of the project from recruiting sponsors to the experiments and the wiki, except for what we mentioned in the acknowledgments section.  Here are our personal profiles, have a look and meet our team! Also check out our sponsoring file !
