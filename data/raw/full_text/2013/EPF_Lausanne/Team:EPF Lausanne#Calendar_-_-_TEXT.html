The team was formed at the beginning of April. April, May and June were dedicated mostly to brainstorming and the choice of the project. Since the exam session was during June and the beginning of July,Lab training and wet lab experiments began not before the second week of July.
Note: this calendar contains only important lab experiments or steps, we didn't mention weekly (or daily) meetings nor routine lab work and researches.
