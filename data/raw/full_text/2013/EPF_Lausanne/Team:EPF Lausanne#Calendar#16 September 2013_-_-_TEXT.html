Western Blot
Using the samples inoculated the Day before, we started a Western blot experiment to prove the expression of our constructs. For this reaction, we used the anti-streptavidin FITC conjugated antibody.
- The Streptavidin Alive initial plasmid transformed cells were used as positive control and competent cells as negative control.
- We finished the experiment the same day because using this antibody we could directly watch the membrane with a typhoon scanner after the first staining step. New strategy
- The first try to assemble the parts of the new strategy didn't succeed. Checked again all the primers, to make sure we didn't made a mistake in the design.
Sensing-Effector
Sequencing of the hya promoter plasmid
-I send the newly isolated and purified hya-containing plasmid for sequencing.
Transformation
-Because the functional assays of the sensing module were inconclusive, I decided to do another transformation with the Plasmids that I had sent for sequencing and whose results showed that the promoters were really present, namely the cad-promoter and the constitutive promoter from iGEM.
