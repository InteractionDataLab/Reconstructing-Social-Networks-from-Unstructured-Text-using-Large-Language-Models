Gibson Transformation
-Transformation of DH5α competent cells with INP_Strep-Dead gibson product previously obtained.

-Overnight Inoculation in LB + Amp medium of colonies from BBa_K283010 (05.08.10) ampicillin plates.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 1st try
- Purification of the digested GPs.
- Measurement of the GPs+dye with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS).
Results: good, we got some 10 nm particles and a few 100 nm. We hope they are nanoparticles and not artifacts.
- Started a new stock of GPs; made the gelatin solution, cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and stirred overnight.
