Cell Surface Display
Functional Assays
- We didn't take enough pictures during the previous microscopy to make a statistical analysis of the cells expressing our constructs. We thus decided to repeat the experiment.
- Inoculation of the same constructs as 29.09.13 with the same conditions.
Effector
Purification
- We did a coomassie staining and an SDS-PAGE of the purification of the GelE and MMP2.
