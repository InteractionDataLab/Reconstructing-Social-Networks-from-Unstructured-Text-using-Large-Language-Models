Sensing-Effector
PCR of Cad Backbone
-We tried to amplify the Backbone for the Cad-GFP construct. But it did not work. Since the restriction digest implied that the plasmid was correct, the problem must have been with the primer temperatures. So we decided to design new primers and try another PCR with the old ones but also adding DMSO.
