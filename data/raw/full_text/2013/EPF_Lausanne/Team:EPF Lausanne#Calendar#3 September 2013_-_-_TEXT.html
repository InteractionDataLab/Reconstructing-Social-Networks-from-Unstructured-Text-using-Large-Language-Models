Repeating Streptavidin Alive (SA) Gibson
- DpnI digestion of the SA purifies PCR product to remove parental plasmid carry over.
- Gibson Reaction between the SA DpnI digested product (insert) and the INP_construct DpnI digested (backbone) in July.
- 0.8% electrophoresis gel to verify gibson product.
- DH5alpha competent cells transformation with Gibson product with negative controls transformations (PCR backbone, PCR insert and water).
Sensing-Effector
Gradient PCR of sensing constructs
-We used the new primers to run a PCR on the backbones and insert of the sensing constructs. But it did not work. Because of that we decided to do a gradient PCR.
Nanoparticles
Labeling of Nanoparticles
-We labelled the biotinylated gelatin nanoparticles with NHS-ester CY5 dye.
