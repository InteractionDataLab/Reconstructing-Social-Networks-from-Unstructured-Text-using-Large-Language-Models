Streptavidin Alive Gibson
- Since the transformation with the previous gibson product didn't work, we decided to repeat the streptavidin Alive PCR to isolate the coding sequence.
- 50µl, 68°C, without DMSO.
- 0.8% electrophoresis gel to verify the reaction product. We had the right product.
- PCR purification.
Nanoparticles

More measurements were made for the MMP2 digestion but the nanoparticles did not get much smaller.
