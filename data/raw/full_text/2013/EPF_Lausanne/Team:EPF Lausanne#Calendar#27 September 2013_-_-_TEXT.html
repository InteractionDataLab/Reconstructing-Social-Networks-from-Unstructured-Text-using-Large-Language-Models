Cell Surface Display
New Strategy
- We found an overlapping between the primers so this could explain why the cloning doesn't work.
Western Blot
- As the last WB didn't work we repeated the experiment keeping the same samples but making carefully the calculation to make the gels.
- This time the migration and the transfer went well. But we still don't have a good positive control.
Sensing-Effector
Measuring GFP expression
-Again I tried to induce GFP expression in the bacteria containing either the hya or the cad promoter.  This time I washed and diluted the cells before putting them in the different media. I also made three replicates of each medium, i.e. three wells with pH 5.5, three well with pH 7, etc. The absorbance was measured in a plate reader during 18h, a measurement was taken every 30 minutes.
Human practice
Kit
- Remaking the transformation starting with NEB 5-alpha high efficiency competent cells.
