Streptavidin iGEM Cloning
Gradient PCR of Streptavidin iGEM miniprep with the following conditions: 68,70,72 °C ; mix without DMSO and mix with 3% and 5% DMSO.
Gel electrophoresis to visualise products.
The 72°C without DSMO showed least unspecific bands so we decided to go on with the larger amount PCR.
larger PCR of 50µl at 72°C without DMSO in the mix.
Gel Electrophoresis to verify product.
Sensing-Effector
Amplifying Plasmids
Transformed DH5 alpha cells with the Plasmids containing parts BBa_I746908 (Arabinose promoter) & BBa_J23119 (pH promoter). These two parts are going to be used later in our experiments.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparticles, 1st try
- Measurement of the new GPs with the DLS: we got no results.
- Measurement of the food dye we used diluted in water: we got the same results as for our first measurement; i.e. some 10 nm and a few 100 nm particles. We can conclude we never had nanoparticles, the protocol we used did not work!
