Cell Surface Display
Inverted Microscopy
- All our constructs (ISA,ISD,ISI and competent cells as negative control) were incubated 1hr with TexRed conjugate nanoparticles.
- Visualization under the microscope with a cy5 filter.
Sensing-Effector
Innoculation of Bacteria with our constructs
-In order to characterize both the sensing and the effector plasmid I inoculated Bacteria in liquid LB cultures over-night.
Nanoparticles
Biotinylation
-We biotinylated the two new nanoparticles batches.
-End of the anti-strepta resistance check (sample mix, use of strepatavidin beads and microscopy)
DSL Measurements
-We did DLS measurements of the new biotinylated nanoparticles (before dialysis).
