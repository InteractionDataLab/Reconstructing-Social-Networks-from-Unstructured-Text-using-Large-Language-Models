MiniPrep
We did a Miniprep of Streptavidin iGEM cells that were inoculated the day before.
Nanoparticles
Making Nanoparicles, 1st try
- Vacuum drying and purification of the digested GPs+dye.
- Learned how to use the DLS. Measured the DGPs+dye.
Results: not good, the machine could not measure anything because the digested GPs were aggregated and too concentrated.
- Vacuum drying and purification of the new GPs.
