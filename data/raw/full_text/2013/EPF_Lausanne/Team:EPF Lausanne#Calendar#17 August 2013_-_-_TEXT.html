-The PCR products from the day before were run on a 0.8% agar gel.(see Results)  The MMP inserts were not visible, we did not add enough DNA for amplification. The backbones were visible but there was no difference between the 4 kb and the 3.5 kb fragments which represent the backbone with and without GFP respectively.
