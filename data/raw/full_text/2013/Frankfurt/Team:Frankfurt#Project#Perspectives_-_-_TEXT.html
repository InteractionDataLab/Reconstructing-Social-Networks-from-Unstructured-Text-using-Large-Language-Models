The futur tastes like Stevia
After the assembly of the Mevalonate and the Steviol plasmids, the next step to accomplish is the co-expression of both the plasmids in S.cerevisiae to achieve an expression of the complete  pathway and thus the production of steviol in an micro-organism. To determine whether steviol production  in yeast could be revelant for industrial causes, the efficiency in terms of quality, quantity and time  consumption has to be estimated and compared to the traditional way of producing.
