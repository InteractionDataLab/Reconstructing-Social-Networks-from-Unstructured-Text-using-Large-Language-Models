We thank Susanne Schwarz from the Presidium for the inestimable help with our financial administration which she did complimentary in addition to her ordinary administration. The Team from Darmstadt did some trials with homologous  structure alignment of some of our enzymes for modeling their structure, we are thankful for that too.
We adress special owing to our funders, the QSL Comission and the Oswald Foundation. We thank the students councils of the biochemical and the physical institutes for their support in the filing of application for the financial support.
