What we did.
In our project, we managed to create two novel biobricks containing the NO sensing promoter norV and the other containing the nrfA gene. These parts will form building blocks for potential future projects for testing for the presence of NOx or its conversion to Ammonia. We hope that our project has stimulated interest in alternatives to the current methods of NOx removal from the environment.
Our project is based on the research on norV and the nrfA genes reported in:

We would like to thank the iGEM foundation, University of Kent and our project supervisors for giving us the opportunity to undertake this project.
