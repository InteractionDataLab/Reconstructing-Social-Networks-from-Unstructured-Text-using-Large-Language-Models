Conclusions
What we did.
In our project, we managed to create two novel biobricks containing the NO sensing promoter orV and the other containing the nrfA gene though unfortunately we ran out of time to create the unified biobrick which contained both of these parts. However these parts will form good building blocks for potential future projects either at Kent or other Universities for testing for the presence of NOx or its conversion to Ammonia. We hope that our project has stimulated interest in alternatives to the current methods of NOx removal from the environment.
We would like to thank those whose research we based this project on, the iGEM foundation, University of Kent and our project supervisors for giving us the chance to undertake this project.
