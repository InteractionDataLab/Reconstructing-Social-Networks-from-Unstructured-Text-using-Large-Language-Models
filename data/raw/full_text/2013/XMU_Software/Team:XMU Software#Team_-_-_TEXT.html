Instructors
Prof. Baishan Fang
Dr. Baishan Fang is the professor in College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University. In the group of biocatalysis and biotransformation, his research mainly focuses on synthetic biology, mining and the transformation of the enzyme, construction of bio-molecular machines, the application of new biocatalysts. His major role of XMU iGEM team is to mentor for all and to enlighten the members.
Associate Prof. I-Son Ng
Dr. I-Son Ng is the associate professor in College of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University. Her research interests are biofuel, engineering of enzyme and protein, zymology, genetic engineering, biochemical separation procedures and proteomics. Her role for the project is to provide suggestions and instruments.
Advisors
Ruosang Qiu
It is great for a team to have an omniscient advisor, even better an inspiring one. Ruosang Qiu , our beloved advisor, definitely is offering both. Her hard work as well as undoubted adorable personality is the motivation of our team members' efforts, her clear mind combined with provident planning lays the foundation of our successful project, To quote her words: I' was a happy iGEMer in 2012, I'm going to make you all happy iGEMers in 2013.
Xin Wu
The past three years have seen his tremendous dedication to iGEM, Xin Wu, a passionate team member in XMU China 2011, a devoted team leader in XMU China 2012 and now, an invaluable advisor in XMU Software 2013. Had it not been Xin Wu's constant encouragement and guidance, we,the inexperienced iGEMers might have been faint-hearted and failed to face up to the challenges during the process. It is drawing on his expertise in synthetic biology and proficiency in iGEM competition that we have solved the seemingly unsolvable and conquered the seemingly unconquerable.
Youbin Mo
Youbin Mo is one of the great advisors of XMU software team in 2013. As a computational biophysicist, y, he is an unquestionable master of biological model and computer programming. In the meanwhile, website constructing is also Mo's technical ability which he acquired by participating the iGEM last year. Youbin gives play to his talent by teaching fundamental program skills to new iGEMers as well as directing them to be self-reliant synthetic biologists.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
All work described on this wiki or on our parts registry pages was done by iGEM Team XMU Software 2013. We managed to finish the whole project, from planning, financing to the complete dry and wet lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:
1. Team XMU China, the wet lab team of our university, gave us a hand to construction work.
2. Tina Zhang, the advisor of team XMU China, helped us in experiments, especially in site-specific mutagenesis and PCR.
3. Prof. Zhiliang Ji, College of Life Science, provided us with valuable guidance in choosing the project.
4. Prof. Shoufa Han, provided us with many instruments such as ELISA reader to test the fluorescence.
5. Qiang Kou, the previous team leader of SYSU-Software team, gives us lots of help.
6. Wenjun Rao, a shy boy from XMU Software College, build the beautiful interfaces for Brick Worker.
7. Wenyao Shao, a nice guy who allowed us use the room 105 as our camp for a whole summer vacation.
8. There are many friends we met during the last year, NJU China, SUSTC-SHENZHEN-B, USTC-Software and so on. Thank you for your supporting.
9. Our sponsors: Xiamen University and Mathwork.
Our City& University
Xiamen
Xiamen, also known as Amoy to the west, is a cozy city located in the southeastern part of China, and has a relaxing coastal charm with a population of 1.3 million. It's a historical harbor city which was founded in the mid-14 century, in the early years of the Ming Dynasty.
