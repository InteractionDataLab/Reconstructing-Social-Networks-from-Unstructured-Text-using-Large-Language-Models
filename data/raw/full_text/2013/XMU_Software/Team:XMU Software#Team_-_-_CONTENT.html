We managed to finish the whole project, from planning, financing to the complete dry and wet lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:</P><P>1. Team XMU China, the wet lab team of our university, gave us a hand to construction work.</P><P>2. Tina Zhang, the advisor of team XMU China, helped us in experiments, especially in site-specific mutagenesis and PCR.</P><P>3. Prof. Zhiliang Ji, College of Life Science, provided us with valuable guidance in choosing the project.</P><P>4. Prof. Shoufa Han, provided us with many instruments such as ELISA reader to test the fluorescence.</P><P>5. Qiang Kou, the previous team leader of SYSU-Software team, gives us lots of help.</P><P>6. Wenjun Rao, a shy boy from XMU Software College, build the beautiful interfaces for Brick Worker.</P><P>7. Wenyao Shao, a nice guy who allowed us use the room 105 as our camp for a whole summer vacation.</P><P>8. There are many friends we met during the last year, NJU China, SUSTC-SHENZHEN-B, USTC-Software and so on. Thank you for your supporting.</P><P>9. Our sponsors: Xiamen University and Mathwork. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="city"><DIV id="city_m1"><DIV class="sep_title">Our City&amp; University</DIV></DIV><DIV id="city_m2"><DIV class="city_m2t1"><DIV class="name">Xiamen</DIV><P>Xiamen, also known as Amoy to the west, is a cozy city located in the southeastern part of China, and has a relaxing coastal charm with a population of 1.3 million.
