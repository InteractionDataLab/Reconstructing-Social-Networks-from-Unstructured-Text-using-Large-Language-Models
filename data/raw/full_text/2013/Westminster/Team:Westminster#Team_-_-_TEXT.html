University of Westminster
The University of Westminster was founded in 1838 and was later awarded university status in 1992. The University is spread across four sites across London – namely, Marylebone, Regents, Harrow and Cavendish. The university also operates the Westminster International University in Tashkent in Uzbekistan and a satellite campus in Paris, France through the Diplomatic Academy of London.
Life Sciences research is based at Cavendish site. A number of research groups are based at the site and carry out high impact research. Some of the groups include the Against Breast Cancer Research Unit led by Dr. Miriam Dwek and the Applied Biotechnology group with interests in biopolymer manufacture. atCavendish campus is the home for Bioscience courses.

Louise Usher
1st Year PhD student
Why I joined:
Having had the opportunity to participate as a team member in 2012, I was keen to continue to build the iGEM spirit here at the University of westminster. the iGEM offers opportunity to develop as a researcher beyond the lab and as an instructor I have found it both challenging and rewarding.
What I do for fun:
I love to travel, and have a top ten list. I enjoy exploratory walks, visiting book shops and markets and socialising with friends and family.
