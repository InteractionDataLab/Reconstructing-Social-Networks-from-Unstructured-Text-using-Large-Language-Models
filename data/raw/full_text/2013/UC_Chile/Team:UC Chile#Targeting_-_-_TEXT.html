Overview
Targeting
To find the targeting sequence to the inside of the  Carboxysome is one of our main objectives in the development of the basic  science associated with our technology. The use of RuBisCO subunits fused with  a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a  protein of the shell of the carboxysome fused with a red fluorescent protein  (RFP) allowed us to see colocalization of our constructs using confocal  microscopy and finally conclude that the long subunit of RuBisCO with GFP  linked at its 3’ end is the construct that will allow us to locate enzymes of  interest into the Carboxysome.
Introduction
One of the main hypothesis on which our technology is based on is that in the  sequence of one of the subunits of RuBisCO can be used as a destination  sequence to the inside of Carboxysome. This assumption is supported mainly on the idea that  it has been reported that other bacterial microcompartments do have targeting  sequences associated with enzymes that are inside of them (1) .
At present, the exact destination sequence that guides enzymes into this particular microcompartment  is unknown (1,2) , but it has been described that the long subunit of RuBisCO is the  best candidate for proper sequestration of enzymes  to the inside of Carboxysome (3) . This is because  RuBisCO’s sequence has a high conservation value between different  microcompartments, so there is more possibility that in its sequence the  targeting tag is contained. It has also been shown that expressing mutated  RuBisCO’s large subunits inside bacteria expressing Carboxysomes resulted in subunits  not going into the microcompartment.
Been able to find the destination sequence has been ranked as one of the most  necessary progress to be made ​​in this area (4,5) . In fact, for Whateversisome  to work, we needed to find this sequence.
Experimental Design
To  answer our hypothesis , we designed  several  experiments based on the use of fluorescent markers to determine by direct  observation our results.
1) Marking Carboxysome :
We created a construct in which we modified the Carboxysome operon  isolated from H. neopolitamus and  optimized by David Savage and his collaborators, who kindly shared it to us  (more information about this step here , by adding a red fluorescent protein (RFP) ( BBa_E1010 ). RFP was coupled by an Ala -Ala- Ala  linker at the 3 'end CsoS1A protein, which is one of the main shell protein from the Carboxysome. This was done using the Gibson  Assembly technique (6) .

2) Marking RuBisCO:
Four genetic  constructs were made ​​ based on binding a green fluorescent protein (superfolder GFP) ( BBa_I746916 ) to one of the subunits of native RuBisCO  of H. neopolitanus. The variants correspond  to: the long and short subunit of RuBisCO with GFP bound via a linker ( BBa_K105012 ), at the 3 'and  5' end in both cases. The linker is a ten aminoacid flexible sequence, chosen  to avoid potencial protein interference.
The expression of these genetic  constructs is under the L-arabinose induced promoter, pBAD ( BBa_K206000 ). This  allows more control over the expression of the construct. We used the RBS  corresponding to BBa_B0034 ,  characterized by Elowits, 1999. They were contained inside the pSB4K5 vector ( BBa_J04450 ),  designed and optimized by GEM2006_Bangalore. It was chosen because it possesses  a different antibiotic resistance than the one used on David Savage’s plasmid.
RuBisCO Large subunit + GFP Construct
To build this BioBrick in the standard form required in order to summit  it to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, we had to mutate an EcoRI  restriction site that was in the middle of sequence of the large subunit of  RuBisCO. To achieve this, we used the Gibson Assembly method.
