Overview
Plant System Biology
“Our main goal is to understand how plants sense and respond to nutrients. And in particular, how nutrient signals interact with other signaling pathways to coordinate global gene expression in plants”
We would like to specially thank all the Plant System Biology for hosting us, the good advices and infinite patience with us!
