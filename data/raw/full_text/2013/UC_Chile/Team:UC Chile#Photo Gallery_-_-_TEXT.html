Overview
Photo Gallery
On December 2012, the “First Chilean Workshop of Synthetic Biology” was celebrated in our university. Professors from remarkable international universities came to our country to show their last researches in Synthetic Biology. During one week, we had the opportunity to participate and learn about this new and interesting discipline. It had a great impact over each member of the team. Because of that, we decided to form the UC Chile 2013 iGEM team and work hard in our project in order to join the jamboree in October. Check out our progress in this photo gallery: to learn more about us, the activities we have done for iGEM, and our progress in the final goal: let everybody know about synthetic biology!
