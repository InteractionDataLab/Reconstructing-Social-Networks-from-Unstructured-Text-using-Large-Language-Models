We didn't work that day.
Summary of Week (1-7)
We are still working on getting used to work in a Biology lab. For some of us it is the first time doing wet lab work.
Summary of Week (8-14)
We mostly worked on our Agro project, focusing on characterizing GV3101 strain, pCAMBIA (our control for binary vector) and getting useful biobricks out of the 2012 iGEM distribution kit.
Summary of Week (15-21)
pHnCBS1D was sent to us! Thanks a lot  ---- ! We started working on our Carbo project by making our own stock of this important plasmid. Also, we took some of the biobricks from the 2012 distribution kit necessary for Carbo. We digested and corroborated the Agro’s 2012 biobricks.
Summary of Week (22-28)
We focused on making the constructs and experiments for the INGENIA fair (one of our Human Practices).  Since we know it takes them a bit of time to grow, we started planting Nicotiana and Arabidopsis seeds.  At the end of the week we received Carbo’s primers!
Summary of Week (29-5)
We prepared the parts for the Gibson Assembly of C.SG and C.GS by doing lots of PCRs but we are having problems amplifying the backbone. Are our primers forming heterodimers?
Summary of Week (6-12)
AddGene toolkit for constructing TALENs is with us now! We worked on getting all the necessary plasmids for the specific TALEN sequence we want to build.  We also tried different strategies for the amplification of the  Carbo’s backbones (such as: Hot start touchdown PCR, changing the buffer for one with GC+DMSO, changing the template, etc). After a lot of struggle we solved the problem . At the end of the week we received Agro’s primers!
Summary of Week (13-19)
Finally, with all our parts for the C.SG and C.GS strategies we worked on Gibson Assembly and E. coli transformation of competent cells. Also, tried out for the first time Golden Gate Assembly for building the TALENs, however, we didn’t get any correct results.
Summary of Week (20-26)
We have our first construct: C.SG ready ! We are sooo happy!  C.GS is showing unexpected results for the colony PCR and the digestion. We are going to try it all over again. Also, we found out that our reagents XGAL and IPTG were not working correctly  so, lots of positives and negatives controls were done in order to check for more mistakes like this one.
Summary of Week (27-2)
Golden Gate Assembly didn’t work this week either. We got the primers for the C.LG and C.GL strategies so we immediately tried to do Gibson PCR for the two of them and the C.GS construct. We also started working on generating a vector for the knockout of the VirD2 gene in Agrobacterium, but didn’t get what we expected.
Summary of Week (3-9)
We are still trying to get C.LG, C.GL and C.GS to work with little success. We also cannot find the reason why the Golden Gate Assembly: Day 1 is not functioning properly. GFP activity on Nicotiana and Arabidopsis was measured using microscopy. Co transformation of pHnCBS1D and C.SG is progressing smoothly.
Summary of Week (10-16)
Induction of co-transformation of pHnCBS1D and C.SG is giving us pretty good results. We found out lots of mistakes we were making, we fixed them and got C.LG and C.GS constructs working.  Golden Gate Assembly is still not working.
Summary of Week (17-23)
Induction of co-transformation of pHnCBS1D with both C.LG and C.GS showed GFP activity under the microscope! Also, our team successfully made the Homologous Recombination vector. The presence of GFP in Nicotiana’s genome was corroborated by PCR.
Summary of Week (24-30)
We mostly focused on working with our C.RFP strategy. We actually had to order some extra primers to amplify the whole backbone.  C.GL is still giving us some troubles.  We got everything settle to transform Agrobacterium and knockout VirD2.
