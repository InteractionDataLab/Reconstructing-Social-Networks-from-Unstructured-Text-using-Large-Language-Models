Overview
Overview
Imagine a world where production of different compound could be easily achievable, where industrial problems associated with genetic manipulation are over: there is no more instability in the energy flux of bacteria. Imagine a world where there are no more industrial biosafety issues because recombinant bacteria is no longer needed in situ. This is the world we propose: the world of in vitro production. To achieve this, we reengineered the Carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) to use it as a continuous reactor capable of generating any output by having the needed enzyme in its inner space. Make Carboxysome your own synthetic space for the production of anything you want:  A Whateversisome!
We have successfully:
Characterized the Carboxysome as a tool for Synthetic Biology: we presented the plasmid as a standardized biobrick.
Found a targeting sequence to the inside of Carboxysome.
Designed an innovative methodology for purification and isolation of BMC.
We analyzed the potential combinatorial of Carboxysomes on in vitro channeling.
Even more…
We are working towards generating step-by-step in vitro reactions.
