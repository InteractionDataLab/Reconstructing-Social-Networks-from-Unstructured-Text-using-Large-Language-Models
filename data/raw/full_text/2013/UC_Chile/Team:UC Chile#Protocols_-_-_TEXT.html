Gibson PCR reaction
∨
∧
Materials
- DNA template
- Nuclease free water
- Master Mix 2X
- Primer Forward
- Primer Reverse
Step by step
1. Mix on ice in a PCR tube:
1ng of Template DNA
0.75μL of Primer forward 10 μM
0.75μL of Primer Reverse 10 μM
15μL of Master Mix 2X*
12.5μL of Nuclease free water
30μL Total
2.  Put the tube in the thermocycler and select the cycling conditions.
Depending on complexity of template DNA (GC content or highly similar sequences), presence of spurious products, or enhance the final yield, different cycling conditions can be used on the PCR.
a. Normal PCR
1. Initialization: 30 seconds at 98 ºC
2. Denaturation: 10 seconds at 98 ºC
3. Annealing: 30 seconds at 56-61 ºC (depending on primer melting temperatures)
4. Elongation: 30 seconds per Kb to amplify at 72 ºC
Steps 2 to 4 are repeated from 30 to 35 times.
5. Final extension: 7 minutes at 72 ºC
b. Touchdown PCR
Touchdown PCR uses higher temperatures for the annealing of the primer with the template for more specific pairing to avoid nonspecific amplifications.
1. Initialization: 30 seconds at 98 ºC
2. Denaturation: 10 seconds at 98 ºC
3. Annealing: 30 seconds at 72 ºC decreasing 1 ºC in each cycle
4. Elongation: 30 seconds per Kb to amplify at 72 ºC
Steps 2 to 4 are repeated 17 times.
5. Denaturation: 10 seconds at 98 ºC
6. Annealing: 30 seconds at 54ºC
7. Elongation: 30 seconds per Kb at 72 ºC
Steps 5 to 7 are repeated 15 times.
8. Final extension: 7 min at 72 ºC
c. Hot Start Touchdown PCR
The idea is for the reaction to have a longer denaturation time so the primers can anneal with a higher probability to the template than with themselves.

Microscopy
∨
∧
Materials
- Xilol
- Lens Cleaning Tissue
- Microscope slides
- Epifluorescence microscope. Ours was Nikon Eclipse Ni
Step by step
A. Sample preparation:
1. Centrifuge bacterial flask at 3.000 rpm for 10 minutes at 25ºC
2. Discard supernatant
3. Resuspend bacteria with the medium left in the flask
4.  Place 20 μL of the sample on a glass slide
5. Place a cover slip on top of the sample
B. Observation:
For the observation under the microscope, the first step is to begin with the lowest magnification. Focus the sample and from there, progressively amplify it using the different objective lens.
When using the maximum amplification (100x objective lens) the use of immersion oil it is needed.  Just apply it between the cover slip and the objective lens (until the lens is touching it).
Remember after finish to clean up the objective with Xilol.
Starting with the 20x objective lens (or any lower) may become difficult if you are not using a staining method, because the magnification is not sufficient for the identification of single bacteria. A good trick is using any particle or contamination that may be within the sample to help with the focus.
The observation of fluorescence is very similar regarding the focusing of the sample but since it uses an excitatory wavelength, it’s necessary to turn off the light and use a special filter depending on the type of fluorescence used.
B. Image Acquisition
All the images are obtained with a camera coupled to the microscope and recorded on a computer using special software. We used NIS-Elements software.

∧
Materials
- TEMB buffer
- CelLytic B-II (Sigma)
- M-280 streptavidin-coated Dynabeads
- MiniMACS magnet
Step by step
Carboxysome purification
1. Grew 3 liters of induced bacteria.
2. Centrifuge at 3.000 RPM for 10 minutes at 25ºC to obtain bacterial pellet.
3. Resupend on 50mL of TEMB buffer.
4. Sonication of cell suspension in an icebath. 4 times, 30 seconds each.
5. High speed centrifugation at 12.000 x g for 20 minutes.
6. Collect the supernatant and resuspend in 20mL of a 30% (vol/vol) solution of CelLytic B-II in TEMB.
7. Centrifuge at 40.000 x g for 30 minutes. After this you should obtain a carboxysome-enriched pellet.
8. Resuspend in 3mL of TEMB buffer.
Carboxysome extraction
1. Place the needed amount of M-280 streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (25 μl or ~1.5 × 107 beads per purification) into a 1.5-ml tube, then add 1 ml of resuspended carboxysomes and invert the tube several times to wash the beads. Pellet the beads by centrifugation at 3,500g for 2 min at 4 °C. Decant and discard the supernatant and resuspend the beads in their original volume with TEMB buffer.
2. Add 25 μl of the bead slurry from Step 1 to the carboxysome suspension. Place the tube on a rotating mixer and rotate at 4 °C for 30 min. After the 30-minutes incubation, remove 20 μl of this solution for analysis of carboxysomes preparation and bead binding through epifluorescence microscopy.
3. Transfer the 1mL mixture of carboxysome and beads from Step 2 into a 15mL tube. Gently add 9mL ice-cold TEMB buffer to the 1mL of carboxysome/bead suspension. Invert gently to mix and keep this suspension at 4 °C while performing Steps 4–6.
4. Begin setting up the flow purification column in the 4 °C cold room. With the MiniMACS magnet oriented horizontally on the bench, slide a TEMB-filled 1-ml pipette tip through the groove in the magnet until the narrow end of the tip protrudes 2.5 cm from the other side of the magnet. The part of the pipette tip running through the groove should be in full contact with the surface of the magnet. All subsequent steps of the carboxysome purification are also performed at 4 °C.
5. Place the magnet with inserted 1mL tip into the ring stand clamp so that the tip is vertical, and allow the TEMB solution in the tip to drain into a beaker. Attach a stopcock to the narrow end of the tip by a 2-cm length of tubing.
6. Close the stopcock and fill the 1mL pipette tip with TEMB until the level of liquid is 1 cm from the top of the tip. 7. Gently invert the Carboxysome/bead mixture from Step 3 several times to mix, and then draw the solution into a 10mL serological pipette using an electronic serological pipetting device.
8. With the 10mL pipette still attached to the pipetting device, gently but firmly secure the narrow end of the 10mL pipette into the wide end of the 1mL pipette tip in the magnet. Carefully remove the pipetting device from the top of the 10mL pipette. The flow purification device is now completely assembled.
9. Gradually open the stopcock on the purification device until a flow rate of 0.75mL min− 1 is reached. Allow the column to drain completely, with the flowthrough draining into a beaker. A collection of beads should become visible on the wall of the 1mL tip as the liquid flows past.
10. Once all liquid has drained from the column, including the 1mL pipette tip, disassemble the column by removing the 10mL pipette and tubing from the ends of the 1mL pipette tip, and then gently removing the 1mL tip from the groove of the magnet.
11. Place 1mL ice-cold TEMB into a 1.5mL tube. Insert the 1mL pipette tip containing collected beads and nuclei onto a micropipette and use it to gently and repeatedly draw the 1mL TEMB into and out of the tip until all beads are released into solution.
12. Using the 1mL of carboxysome/bead mixture from Step 3, perform a second round of flow purification by repeating Steps 3–11. Remove 20 μl from the 1mL of final purified nuclei suspension for analysis of purity, same as in step 2.
13. Centrifuge the 1mL purified carboxysome/bead mixture at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to collect bead-bound carboxysome. Carefully decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 μl ice-cold TEMB and place on ice.
14. Store purified carboxysomes at -80ºC.
