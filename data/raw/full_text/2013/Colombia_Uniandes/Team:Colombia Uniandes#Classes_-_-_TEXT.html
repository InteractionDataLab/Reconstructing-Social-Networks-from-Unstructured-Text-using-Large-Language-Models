Classes
Our team is made ​​up of students from different areas of knowlegde, from design to engineering. We consider the only thing you need in order to be part of us is motivation. This is why, we made a series of classes where everyone can learn about everything that the project is going to be about. So our classes started as basic as cellular biology, passing through matlab, differential equations, genetic circuits and lab basics, such as restriction enzymes and PCR. Here you can check our presentations, and there is to stand out that all this training was made by students from iGEM 2012, so they can pass all they experience to the new members of the group. We made PopQuizzeess and All! :)  Look at us paying attention in our classes and see our slides ;)
