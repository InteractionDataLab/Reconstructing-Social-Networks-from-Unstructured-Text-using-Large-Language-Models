Our Superheroes
SuperGMOs
Nicko is our Magnetospirillum magneticum bacterium super hero. He has the power of absorbing nickel from contaminated water like a super vacuum. Due to he has magnetosomes, Nicko loves magnetic fields and when one is near he feels attracted to it.
Chimi is a super yeast. She is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has the power to detect stress levels in animal tissue. If she senses stress she will show a red signal.

Daniel Giraldo
Daniel is an undergraduate Chemistry and Chemical Engineering double major senior at Universidad de los Andes. Although he decided to study Chemistry, he has always had an interest in Biology and is always eager to learn about other fields. He is very interested in learning more about organic chemistry applied to biological systems, which is why iGem is the perfect opportunity for him to explore a little bit into microbiology and synthetic biology. His very passionate about research and working at the lab. This year Daniel decided to hang the lab coat and joined the modeling team.
Laura Estefania Gonzalez Valenzuela
Laura is an undergraduated student of Microbiology and Biology at Universidad de los Andes.  She joined iGEM this semester for the first time, and she’s been learning a lot about how biological  systems work in terms of constants, rates and genetic networks. Through this experience she has  met hardworking young people interested in science, that’s why  she’s really excited about this competition, because is a new proposal to make science in our country.
Carlos Eduardo Posada
Carlos is an undergraduate student of Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. He joined iGEM this year because he was amazed by the still untapped potential of synthetic biology. Through iGEM, he has learned a lot about molecular biology at the lab. He loves video games, specially the Nintendo ones, eating a lot and petting his two dwarf rabbits :) Genetics is the field that most attracts him in his career.
Daniel Sebastian Castaño
Daniel is an undergraduate student of Design and Systems Engineering. His abilities are the illustration, animation, video production and high performance computer management.  He saw in this competition the opportunity to meet new people, test his own abilities, and learn via interdisciplinarity. Although it is his first time in the lab and in the modeling process, he is very happy due to the possibility to help and give his point of view. His objective is to show the importance of design and systems engineering in other disciplines, even though they are quite different.
Lina Contreras
Lina is an undergraduate student in Biology and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. She loves learning new things, that's why this year she decided to be part of iGEM Colombia team. She sees in iGEM the opportunity to meet new people who also love science, to be part of an interdisciplinary environment and to gain experience that will be useful in her future. Lina is part of the laboratory and Human practices.
Alejandra Castilla Asaf
Alejandra is an undergraduate student in Chemical Engineering at the Universidad de los Andes. She is interested in bioinformatics and biological systems, and how it would be apply to solve problems in the environment that will allow providing solutions to improve the quality of life. For this reason, iGEM is the perfect opportunity to learn more about the different microorganisms, molecular biology and programming. Also for know people with different and greats ideas, she thinks this will allow her to see things from another point of view and determine which benefits society, especially to Colombia, in order to promote the development of science and technology.
Carolina Salazar
Carolina is an undergraduate student in Biomedical Engineering and Biology. She has always had interest in how biological systems work and how their mechanisms may be applied to solve problems in medicine or in engineering practices.  She sees in iGEM the opportunity to improve her design and computing skills as well as to gain knowledge on molecular and synthetic biology.
She is really excited to be part of this team as she knows she’ll meet new people from whom she may learn a lot!
Daniela Olivera
Daniela is an undergraduate student in Chemical engineering and Microbiology at the Universidad de los Andes. She is interested in bioinformatic and biomedical engineering research. This year Daniela is leading the mathematical model group. She loves to spend her little free time playing with her cat (named Anastasia), working on iGEM with her lucky friends, going to cinema and burning calories in the gym.
Maria Alejandra Hernandez Santana
Maria Alejandra is a Chemistry and Microbiology undergraduate student at Uniandes. She is part of Human Practices (HP) and Lab Teams, and even though she loves science and spending time in the lab, she also enjoys very much her activities of HP, because she thinks science should serve to improve society's life quality. That's why Ma. Alejandra found in iGEM the possibility to fuse her passion with her wish of saving the world:)
Laura Rodriguez
Laura is an undergraduate student in Chemistry and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. She is passionate about science, likes organic chemistry and loves bacteria! She is also curious and a realll hard worker. For her, iGEM has been an opportunity to learn, practice lab skills and making good friends!. She is really excited to meet people involved in science from another countries, this will give her a perspective of science outside her country and will also be a cultural enriching experience.
Paula Manuela Siauchó Unriza
Paula is an undergraduate student in Physics and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. She loves knowledge, she is very curious and she love everything related to science, specially anything related with live and how it can be modeled and understood whith Physics, it's amazing!. That's why she like so much iGEM, besides the social aspect that both proyects have and, off course, the experience of being part of this wonderful team.
Santiago Andrés Cadena Cerón
Santiago is an Electrical and Biomedical Engineering student at Universidad de los Andes.. He has a strong interest in computational neuroscience. Specifically in modelling stochastic and complex behavior.
Camilo Gómez Garzón
Camilo is an undergraduate student in Chemistry and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. He loves science and, specially, everything that combines these two areas of knowledge such as biochemistry, communication among bacteria, biocatalysis and molecular biology. He is currently working in Laboratory and Human Practices of Colombia iGEM Team, activity that he sees as a great opportunity to grow and improve as scientist and person; knowing new features and applications of synthetic biology and asking for problems that we can resolve with it.
Alejandro Otero Bravo
Alejandro is an undergraduate in Biology and Microbiology with a wide range of interests including entomology, animal evolution, biocontrol, molecular biology and systems biology. He also loves food, tattoos and punny humor. He joined iGEM to learn about lab work, systems biology and the information exchange between the scientist and the public.
César Augusto Quintana Cataño
Cesar is an undergraduate physics and microbiology student. He enjoys a lot working and achieving new memories in this competition. Science is one of his mayor passions as music and enjoying a great anime are. He likes a lot systems biology and biomechanics.
Grad Students
Silvia J Cañas
Silvia is a M.Sc student in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) at the Biophysics Laboratory and the Mycology and Phytopathology Laboratory (LAMFU) at the Universidad de los Andes. She is a B.
