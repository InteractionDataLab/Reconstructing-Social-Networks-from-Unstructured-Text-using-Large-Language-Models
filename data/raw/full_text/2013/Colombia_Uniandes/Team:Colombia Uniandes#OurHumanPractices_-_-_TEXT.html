Human Practices, Overview
Acording to the concept of Human Practices in iGEM comptetion, we were looking for new ways to help human civilization consider, guide, and address the impacts of ongoing advances in biotechnology. With this aim, we carried out multiple activities with different kind of people, each one with a specific methodology and with a specific goal.
Under these criteria our activities are divided in three main axes (or sets): Corporative, Educative and Social.
We invite you to explore the three axes of our Human Practices! where you can find the explanation of each of these axes and what we did, with multimedia material and with our results about how the people responded.
Explore our Human Practices' activities!
