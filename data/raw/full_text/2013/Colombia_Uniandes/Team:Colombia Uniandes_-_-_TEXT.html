Welcome to Colombia Team 2013
Hi! this year we have two projects: The first one, consists in the design of a bacterium able to absorb nickel from water and the second one is a sensor that determines glucocorticoid stress level of animals. These projects would improve the quality of life for animals, and people of the areas surrounding mines, especially in countries in process of development.
