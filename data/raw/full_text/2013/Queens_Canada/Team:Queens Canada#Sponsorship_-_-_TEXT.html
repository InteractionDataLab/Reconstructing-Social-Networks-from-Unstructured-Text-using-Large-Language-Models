Interested in Sponsoring?
Here at QGEM, we have a lot of passion for what we do. The tragedy though is that passion isn't exchangeable for reagents, which is something that we also need an abundance of. If you would like to show your support for our cause and sponsor us, download the sponsorship package and see what exactly it entails!
Money can't buy us love but it can buy us lab equipment.
Click here to download the sponsorship package in pdf format! We promise it's nifty.
If you have any questions or inquiries about the sponsorship package or potential benefits, don't hesitate to email our project manager Henry Barron at henry.barron@qgemteam.com.
