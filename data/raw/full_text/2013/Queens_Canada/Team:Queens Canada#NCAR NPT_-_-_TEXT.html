NCAR-NPT BioBrick Part
Carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) is an enzyme that converts fatty acids such as isovaleric into aldehydes. Phosphopantetheinyl transferase (NPT) is an enzyme that induces a post-translational modification by adding a pantetheinyl arm to the active site of the carboxylic acid reductase, which is crucial for the formation of a thioester intermediate.
