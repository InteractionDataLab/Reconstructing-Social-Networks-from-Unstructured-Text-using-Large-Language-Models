AtoE BioBrick Part
AtoE is a membrane transporter of short chain fatty acids. This gene is normally expressed in E. coli but in our project, the plan is to constitutively express this gene such that it is constantly uptaking surrounding isovaleric acid. Once within the bacteria, other reactions ensue. Select "Lab Book" to view our procedure in detail!
