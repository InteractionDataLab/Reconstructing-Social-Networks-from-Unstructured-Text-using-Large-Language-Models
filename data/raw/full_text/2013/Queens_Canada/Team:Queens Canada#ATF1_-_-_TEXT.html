ATF1 BioBrick Part
Acetyl transferase 1 (ATF1) was a BioBrick created by MIT in 2006 as part of their iGEM project. It is derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and it catalyzes the conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, a compound that gives off a banana scent. This is the final step of our pathway, completing the neutralization of isovaleric acid. Select "Lab Book" to view our procedure in detail!
