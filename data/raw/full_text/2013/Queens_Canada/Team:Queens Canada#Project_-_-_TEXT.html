Repel.
First, we plan to eliminate foot odor with engineered bacteria and replace it with natural mosquito repellants. This will make it more difficult for mosquitoes to find their hosts, without the risk of developing resistance.
Overview.
Check out the overview of our project to read about our goals this summer! And because a picture is worth a thousand words (with the economy in its current state the exchange rate may be closer to eight hundred), we've also included an infographic!
Attract.
Second, we intend to devise a mosquito trap where bacteria will synthesize the chemicals found in foot and body odour. Once the mosquitoes are trapped, we aim to further resolve disease by infecting the mosquitoes to sterilize, control, or destroy the vectors.
