Here's a little bit about us
Queen's University is located in Kingston, Ontario, a beautiful limestone city which was Canada's first capital. Their iGEM team is composed of dedicated students who have devoted their summer to working with synthetic biology, toiling away in labs, promoting the field to others through outreach, and having a blast along the way. Our project this year initially began as an idea to remove foot odour. It eventually evolved to a much broader idea involving mosquitoes, malaria, and smelly feet!

Meet the Team
HENRY BARRON
Henry is a third-year student studying Life Sciences. He dreams of a future that is inspiring and exciting. He also loves art but can't draw or paint. These two things have led him to synthetic biology.
JAMES KIM
James is a second-year student studying Life Sciences. As a scholar, gentleman as well as a boxer, you can likely find him holding doors open for damsels, pondering the mysteries of the universe, and performing spartan pushups (yes, they are as difficult as they sound).
MACKENZIE JAMIESON
Mack is a fourth-year Life Sciences student. His spirit animal is the dragon because his smouldering eyes could probably burn anyone to a crisp. His commitment to toned biceps is matched only by his love for synthetic biology, the canvas upon which he paints with powerful strokes of genius.
SYLVESTER CHIANG
Sylvester is a third-year student studying Biomedical Computing. He is aptly described as a combination of his predecessors, Sylvester the cat and Sylvester Stallone, an individual of persistence and impressive muscular structure.
CINDY ZHU
Cindy is a fourth-year Life Sciences and Psychology student. She is excited to join iGEM due to the infinite possibilities of synthetic biology, and to contribute to both labwork and creative projects. In her spare time, she enjoys reading Oliver Sacks, Youtubing Broadway musicals, and sangria.
DYLAN PIETTE
Dylan entering his fourth-year in the Biochemistry program. He really enjoys building orphanages in third-world countries, raising money for the donation of livestock and when it all gets too much, Dylan will kick back in his lawn chair and work on his children's novel.
SIMON HUANG
Simon is a fourth-year Life Science student. Much like Charlie Sheen, it is very difficult to find him not winning. When he isn’t exploring the wonders of synthetic biology, he secretly trains to be a Tetris pro.
MITANGI PAREKH
Mitangi Parekh is going into her fifth-year of Biology and English and is ridiculously excited to be back with QGEM for yet another summer. Her passions include writing and drinking copious amounts of iced coffee. She also has a special bond with huskies; in a remote village in Siberia, she is known as The Husky Whisperer.
TONY ZHU
Tony is going into third year of Life Sciences at Queen's. He's allergic to mangoes but he eats them anyways.
STEPHANIE CHAN
Stephanie blends in with the high schoolers, but in reality she is a third-year Life Sciences student. When not doing plasmid preps or running PCR gels, Steph can be found in her natural habitat, Stauffer, battling her MCAT books. She is also a keen curator of cute cat captions.
ANDY SONG
Andy is entering his fourth-year as a Life Sciences major and hails from Nova Scotia, a land famous for Keith's and copious amounts of salt water. He enjoys playing sports, hanging out with friends, and playing Settlers of Catan. His academic interests include GI cell physiology, saccade movements, and of course synthetic biology.
KYLE SUNDERLAND
Kyle is entering his third-year in the Biomedical Computing program at Queen's. With a strong interest in Neuroscience and prosthetic limbs, he figured iGEM would be a great way to combine his interests of biology and computing together. He hasn't looked back since.
LAURA CHU
Laura is entering her third year of Life Sciences. She loves cooking, reading, and watching a good old Leafs game. She loves heavy metal music and has recently developed an addiction to Benedict Cumberbatch's cheekbones. She can often be found daydreaming about her next meal.
MADDY TONG
Maddy is entering her third year in the Life Sciences program. Her days are often spent on the computer playing video games, working with Photoshop, and browsing aimlessly on websites. She also enjoys cooking, eating, and pipetting things in the lab.
