Our exciting journey started late May this year. In our lab notebook we have documented and recorded all the steps and experiments performed to bring into being the genetically engineered DCA degrading microbes we first imagined.  As well as keeping records in our lab notebook we kept an online progress log that could be accessed outside of the lab by all members of the team.  Below is a weekly summary of our progress. The daily logs provide more details. Links to protocols used are given.
