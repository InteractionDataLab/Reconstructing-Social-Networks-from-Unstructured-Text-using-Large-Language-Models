Publicity
Over the course of the project, we've made several attempts to publicize iGEM within the university and in Australia, to raise general awareness about not only our project but the competition in general. A significant part of this was the creation of the 'Strange Nature' writing competition, which aimed to engage high school students with the concepts of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. To advertise the competition, we sought the assistance of the Australian Science Teacher’s Association, the Gifted and Talented Students Organisations in each state, the Association of Independent Schools, CSIRO Education, as well as numerous home-schooling organisations and online education portals and emailed hundreds of schools across the country informing them about the writing competition and encouraging them to involve their students.
Aside from the Strange Nature competition, we made several appearances in the university media over the last few months, including:
A piece by Robbie in the University of Sydney School of Biology Newsletter (page 5) describing our project in the early days of experimental work
An article by Vanda Northwood in the University of Sydney Science Alliance Newsletter (page 7) about our project and the Strange nature competition.
A brief article on the University of Sydney School of Molecular Bioscience website outlining the experimental focus of our project
An interview with Robbie on the University of Sydney School of Biology website after the Asia Regional Jamboree.

Furthermore, Andrew was interviewed by Angela Owens for 702 ABC Radio about the Strange Nature competition and our project.
