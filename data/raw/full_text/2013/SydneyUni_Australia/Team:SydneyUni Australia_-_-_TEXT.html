We’re a team of eight excited undergraduates from Sydney University, Australia, with huge interests in biochemistry and bioengineering. We’re new to iGEM this year, but fingers crossed, we'll do well and have a blast while doing it!
Most of our work involved trying to build a pathway to degrade dichloroethane (DCA). This contaminant has leaked into the groundwater in Botany , Sydney, and elsewhere around the world. Our aim is to assemble a pathway for DCA degradation.
We created a science-writing competition for Australian high-school students. By providing an online platform for students and teachers to explore Synthetic Biology we hope to inspire imagination and critical reflection about our future.
