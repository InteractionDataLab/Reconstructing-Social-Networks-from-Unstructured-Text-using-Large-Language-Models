To our knowledge this hasn’t been shown by anyone else before. </LI><LI>This is pretty cool, but during the middle of the year we decided to try synthesising the whole pathway rather than building it by conventional cloning. The length of the ToMO gene cluster meant it was too expensive for us to continue working with it. In place of ToMO we turned to a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which had been shown in early 2013 to play the same role as ToMO in the initial step of DCA-degradation (Nishino et al. 2013). </LI><DIV class="pictext"><DIV class="pictextl" style="height: 100px; line-height: 100px"><I>E. coli</I> expressing ToMO converts indole to indigo:</DIV></DIV><LI><A href="#restart">Back to top</A></LI></UL><H2>Gibson Assembly was Problematic</H2><H3>Progress</H3><H4TRANSFORMATION><UL><LI>We spent a week optimising the transformation of our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:SydneyUni_Australia/Project/Design">Gibson Assembly reaction product</A>. We initially tried transformation into <I><I>E. coli</I></I> EPI300 and yielded no transformants. We suspected that there may be a metabolic burden or harm to cells carrying our correctly assembled product, due to the strong constitutive expression of our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:SydneyUni_Australia/Project/Design">designed promoter, Psyn</A>. To account for this we tried transforming into <I><I>E. coli</I></I> EPI400, which carries plasmids at low copy-number with an inducible increase in copy-number. We also tried incubating and growing cells at room temperature to lessen their growth rate, so that they might be able to better cope with any possible toxicity of the transformed Gibson Assembly reaction product. Neither of these were successful; however, we were able to screen 87 clones by transforming into a different strain, <I><I>E. coli</I></I> TOP10.</LI></UL><H4> Screening </H4><UL><LI>We screened 87 clones for the presence of dhlB, a gene responsible for the breakdown of chloroacetate in our pathway, by incubating resting cells with chloroacetate and <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:SydneyUni_Australia/Project/Protocols#chloride">chloride assay</A>. A few clones from each type of pathway looked promising, so we proceeded to extract plasmids from these for further investigation.</LI><DIV class="pictext" style="height: 130px;"><DIV class="pictextl">dhlB PCR screening:We expected a band at ~800 bp for an amplification of dhlB, the gene in our pathway responsible for the degradation of chloroacetate. We didn’t see it in any of the 87 clones used in the phenotypic chloride assay, where a few of the clones had exhibited increased production of Cl<SUP>-</SUP> ions from the chloroacetate substrate compared to control cells. </DIV></DIV></UL><H4>Plasmid Preps</H4><UL><LI>None of the clones from which we extracted plasmids contained the correctly assembled insert. By PCR and diagnostic restriction digests on these plasmids we were able to distinguish two different misassembled versions of our desired Gibson Assembly reaction product. </LI><DIV class="pictext" style="height: 370px;"><DIV class="pictextl">Plasmid Digests:We did a second plasmid prep of our clones because the first weren’t very clear. Desmond figured out that by digesting the plasmids with EcoRV we ought to see a single 2 kb band if pSB has closed on itself. We don't see anything like this in our clones, but we know from the rfp that this works (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J04450">BBa_J04450</A> is about 3 kb, and contains a single EcoRV site in the pSB backbone). If the plasmid contains our gBlocks (or at least iGEMBLOCK 1 with aldA), then we expect to see two bands -  one at 1 kb, a second at 5 or 6 kb (depending on whether we're looking at p450 or the adh plasmid). We don't see this either. We think that in most of the plasmids, some of the gBlocks have assembled in pSB1C3 but not iGEMBLOCK 1. In one of the clones (64) we see a band at 1 kb but nothing else, so maybe iGEMBLOCK1 assembled in pSB, but not other gBlocks.
						Interestingly, rfp looks spot-on while our results are similar to that in the last plasmid prep (everything slightly higher than 3 kb, except 64). With rfp we expect a single band at 3 kb (pSB is 2 kb plus the rfp 'part' is 1 kb, and the whole construct contains a single EcoRV site in pSB). Notably, 64 was one of the small p450 colonies we patched from Gibson Assembly Product transformations.
					</DIV></DIV></UL><H4>PCR from Gibson template</H4><UL><LI>We thought it could have been possible to assemble our entire pathway from smaller fragments salvaged from our Gibson Assembly reaction product. This proved impossible, presumably due to the extent of heterogenous template including both correctly and incorrectly assembled gBlocks in the Gibson Assembly reaction product. It may have been possible to do something similar using IDT’s gBlocks as template, however, this was not possible as we’d used up all of one of gBlocks during a second Gibson Assembly. </LI></UL><UL><DIV class="pictext"><DIV class="pictextl">This is our gel analysis of our GA products. Ap, Bp, Cp are from the p450 pathway, using our GA reaction product as template.  Aa, Ba and Ca are from the adh pathway. It looks like we can’t amplify what we want, or that it doesn’t exist in the GA reaction product.</DIV></DIV><LI><A href="#restart">Back to top</A></LI></UL><H3>Lessons</H3><H4>Constitutive Expression</H4><UL><LI>We suspect that some of the genes we tried to assemble (e.g., p450, Nishino <I>et al.</I>, 2013) can harm the cells they're expressed in, whether this is by using up resources or unusual interactions with undesired targets in the cell. If this is the case, then by a sort of natural screening we were only able to find colonies on plates that contain misassembled gBlocks that did not successfully express these genes. </LI><LI>Upon reflection, we approached the assembly of our pathway with an almost child-like ignorance and optimism. Our promoter was specifically designed to maximise expression of our construct, as if ‘the more pollutant degrading genes, the better’. If the hypothesis above is correct, then we might have had more success with an inducible promoter.</LI></UL><H4>Modularity</H4><LI> Consider the parable of the watchmakers: <I> &quot;There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who manufactured very fine watches. Both of them were highly regarded, and the phones in their workshops rang frequently - new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered, while Tempus became poorer and poorer and finally lost his shop. What was the reason?
                                The watches the men made consisted of about 1,000 parts each. Tempus had so constructed his that if he had one partly assembled and had to put it down - to answer the phone say - it immediately fell to pieces and had to be reassembled from the elements. The better the customers liked his watches, the more they phoned him, the more difficult it became for him to find enough uninterrupted time to finish a watch.
                                The watches that Hora made were no less complex than those of Tempus. But he had designed them so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten elements each. Ten of these subassemblies, again, could be put together into a larger subassembly; and a system of ten of the latter sub-assemblies constituted the whole watch. Hence, when Hora had to put down a partly assembled watch in order to answer the phone, he lost only a small part of his work, and he assembled his watches in only a fraction of the man-hours it took Tempus.&quot; </I><A href="http://ecoplexity.org/files/uploads/Simon.pdf">(Simon, 1962)</A></LI><LI>The sequences we had synthesised as gBlocks by IDT were designed so that they could only be assembled in the whole DCA-degradation pathway, rather than as parts within pSB1C3 which could then be assembled piece-by-piece. This meant that our success relied on the correct assembly of the entire pathway, and when this failed, that we were unable to access parts of the pathway. </LI><H4>Plans</H4><UL><LI><B>Replacement of gBlocks</B></LI><UL><LI>By replacing a single <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:SydneyUni_Australia/Project/Design">gBlock</A>, it might be possible to find correctly assembled Gibson products by substituting our strong constitutive promoter Psyn with a repressible promoter.</LI><LI>With four new gBlocks, it might be possible to assemble some of the important genes in our pathway (aldA, p450, adh1b1) in a BioBrick vector, so that they could then be subsequently assembled piecewise. </LI></UL><LI><B>PCR Assembly</B></LI><UL><LI><A href="https://www.idtdna.com/pages/decoded/decoded-articles/core-concepts/decoded/2012/09/21/assembly-pcr-for-novel-gene-synthesis">PCR Assembly</A> provided an alternative option to GA for us. It might be possible to PCR amplify genes directly from our gBlocks as template rather than our Gibson Assembly reaction product. Alternatively, with the design of new primers, the genes of interest might be amplified from gBlocks for cloning into a BioBrick vector. With either of these options, sequence fidelity may be an issue.</LI><LI>Since Hong Kong we have tried this, and it proved unsuccessful based on the protocol from (<A href="#xiong04">Xiong, 2004</A>), using our gBlocks of aldA, p450 and tetR and some primers.
