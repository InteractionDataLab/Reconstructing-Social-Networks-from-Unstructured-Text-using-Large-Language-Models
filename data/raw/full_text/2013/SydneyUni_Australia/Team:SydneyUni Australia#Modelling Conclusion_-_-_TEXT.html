Conclusions:
In our model we find that 1 mM of DCA is removed from solution within roughly 150 minutes when the DCA degrading cells are at a concentration of 2 x 108 cells/mL ( graph 1 and graph 5 ).
It is also evident that bacterial growth can occur ( graph 4 , graph 8 and graph 9 ). This growth is due to the degradation of DCA to glycolate. We can also see that that bacterial growth correlates with glycolate accumulation (by comparing graph 6 and graph 9 ).
The cytotoxic metabolic intermediate chloroactealdehyde does not accumulate to a significant concentration in either of the pathways and is consistently at a negligibly low concentration. We can see that chloroacetaldehyde reaches a maximum concentration of roughly 0.2 mM in both pathways ( graph 3 and graph 7 ). Chloroacetaldehyde is apparently metabolised very quickly; this concentration maximum is short lived, peaks at roughly 0.03 seconds and returns back to 0 mM by 0.5 seconds. It is expected that chloroacetaldehyde toxicity will not be a problem in our engineered cells.
We also conclude that the two pathways remove DCA at the same rate (by comparing graph 1 and graph 5 ).
