BioBrick Parts Submitted to or Characterized in the Registry
Promoters
We characterized the pLAC and pTET inducible promoters and this information is available on the Experience page for each part.
Part: BBa_R0011, Link: pLAC
Part: BBa_R0040, Link: pTET
Guide RNAs (gRNA) for CRISPRi
We submitted 4 guide RNAs to the parts registry. The GFP and RFP gRNA's have been tested and shown to work in our experiments and in published results.
See the chart below for links to the parts registry pages for the RFP, GFP, XylE, and LacZ targeting gRNAs.
