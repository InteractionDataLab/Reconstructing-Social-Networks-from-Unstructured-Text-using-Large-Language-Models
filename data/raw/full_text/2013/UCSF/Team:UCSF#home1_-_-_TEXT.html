Operation CRISPR: Deploying precision guided tools to target unique species in a complex microbiome
In microbial communities, bacterial populations are commonly controlled using indiscriminate, broad range antibiotics. There are few ways to target specific strains effectively without disrupting the entire microbiome and local environment. The goal of our project is to take advantage of a natural horizontal gene transfer mechanism in bacteria to precisely affect gene expression in selected strains. We combine bacterial conjugation with CRISPRi, an RNAi-like repression system developed from bacteria, to regulate gene expression in targeted strains within a complex microbial community. One possible application is to selectively repress pathogenic genes in a microbiome, leaving the community makeup unaffected. In addition, we use CRISPRi to lay the groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells.
Team
Meet our dedicated team of under-graduates who conceived of, planned, and carried out the whole project.
Project
Discover our precision guided tools to target unique species in a complex microbiome and our groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells.
Modeling
Take a look at how we use mathematical modeling to facilitate the design and construct of our project.
Human Practice
Examine how we teach Synthetic Biology to the general public through night event at Exploratorium and to high school students through a collaboration with Lincoln High School.
