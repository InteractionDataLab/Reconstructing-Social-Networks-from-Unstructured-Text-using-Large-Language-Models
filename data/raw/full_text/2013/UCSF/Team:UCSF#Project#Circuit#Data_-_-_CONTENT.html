Before we could create promoters that respond to a high and low amount of inducer, we first had to select promoters with two favorable characteristics we could exploit to make them concentration-dependent which would be a low basal level and a wide dynamic range. We chose four well-known promoters as possible candidates for our circuit: pLAC, pTet, pBAD, and PprpB. We constructed separate plasmids containing each of the promoters and characterized these promoters by measuring the GFP expression over time. We determined the basal level, highest induction level, and inducer range. We selected pLAC &amp; pTET as the promoters for the synthetic circuit, because of their low basal expression and the varying responsiveness at different inducer concentrations. </FONT></DIV><DIV id="description" style="width:700px; height:100px; margin-left:120px; margin-bottom:20px" align="justify"><FONT face="calibri" size="2">Dose-response curve for pLAC promoter induced with different amount of inducers (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 120 uM IPTG).

Based on <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16432263">previous work</A> in the literature characterizing the pLAC promoter, we chose to change both the number and orientation of repressor binding sites in pLAC.

To create our &quot;low&quot; inducer promoter, we shifted the O1 operator site further downstream of our promoter sequence and removed another operator site from pLAC to relieve repression. To create our &quot;high&quot; promoter, we took the &quot;low&quot; promoter and added the O3 operator site further upstream near the start of the promoter sequence. The O3 operator site will then form a loop with our O1 operator site, thus creating a physical barrier to prevent transcription, reducing the promoter activity at low levels of inducer. </FONT></DIV><DIV id="photos"><CENTER><DIV id="description" style="width:700px; height:70px; margin-left:120px" align="justify"><FONT face="calibri" size="2">On this diagram (A) denotes the very original pLAC which is found in the parts registry. (B) is our re-engineered pLAC that has an added O3 binding site. We found in literature that by adding an O3 binding site, a higher inducer level is required to start transcription for a loop to form between the 03 and 01 binding sites. We expect we would need more inducer to produce similar levels of GFP.  
</FONT></DIV><DIV id="description" align="justify" style="width:950px; height:50px"><FONT face="calibri" size="4"> When we engineered the pLAC promoter, the dynamic range is insignificantly different. This graph shows that the green fluorescent protein is expressing at the same inducer concentration for both of the promoters. So we went back to the drawing board and redesigned the pLAC promoter.

We also created a <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:UCSF/Modeling">

 of our system and were able to identify important variables and parameters that would help produce our decision making circuit.

As a result, we can use a vast number of individual gRNAs to repress several genes, giving us the ability to design circuits to make numerous and more complex decisions. 
Our proof-of-concept design is, at a low level of inducer, to express GFP simultaneously with a gRNA to repress RFP. When the inducer level increases, the &quot;high&quot; sensing promoter turns on expression of RFP and a gRNA to repress GFP, making a switch-like decision based on the input. We were able to construct an early design of the circuit in the pCDF plasmid that contains both fluorescent proteins and gRNAs. We initially put both components of the circuit under individual promoters, pLAC and pTET, as a control to test whether or not we could obtain expression of both products and repression from the gRNAs, both under individual induction and after switching inducers. Since this circuit relies on CRISPR repression, we had to also construct a plasmid (pACYC) containing the catalytically dead dCas9 protein as well as the Csy4 protein to cleave the RNA products (see Design page or Parts Registry for more information). 


We are in the final stages of cloning the dCas9 plasmid and we hope to test the circuit soon.
