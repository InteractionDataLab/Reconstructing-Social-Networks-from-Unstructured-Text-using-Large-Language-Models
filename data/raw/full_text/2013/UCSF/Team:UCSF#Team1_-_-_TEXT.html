Priyanka Dadlani
Hi everyone! I am Priyanka Dadlani, an undergraduate at UC-Berkeley studying chemistry, earning my teaching credential, and having fun exploring computer science.  My future interests include studying pharmacology and incorporating computational techniques into my research.  In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking near scenic areas, such as Cayucos and Inspiration Point. Not to mention, I love trying out new restaurants and tapioca drinks.
David Dinh
Hello! My name is David Dinh. I am a recent graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School and headed to UC Davis this fall as an undergraduate. Currently, I am debating between either majoring in Biotechnology or Molecular Biology. Afterward, I want to earn a Masters degree and a PhD. My friends say that I can be very loud and that I am too nice for my own good. In my free time, I like to play tennis and computer games or hang out with my friends. I first got interested in science in the fifth grade when my teacher accidently “overcooked” a dragonfly in her car during a school field trip.
Ian Ergui
I am Ian Ergui, a University of Miami student and Howard Hughes Medical Institute undergraduate researcher. My research interests lie in the fields of synthetic biology, epigenetics and pharmacoepigenetics. As a research assistant at the Hussman institute of Human Genomics at UM, I conduct research on the effects of cocaine use on genomic methylation in the brain as well as bacterial engineering experiments. I am happy to have the opportunity to be part of the 2013 UCSF iGEM team. When not in lab, I enjoy training in Gracie Jiu Jitsu and boxing.
Felicity Jika
Hey! My name is Felicity Jika, and I have been interested in science for as long as I can remember. I am a recent graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco and will be attending San Francisco State University in the fall. I was born in Nigeria and came to America when I was four years old. I am interested in foreign drama shows and reading books about magic, which, to me, is science that can’t be explained.
Derrick Lee
Hi, I’m Derrick! I recently graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco and plan to attend City College of San Francisco with the intention of transferring to UC-Davis in two years. So far my goal is to major in Molecular Biology and possibly pursue a PhD. In my off time, I enjoy playing games, watching movies, and eating.
Sherry Teng
My name is Sherry Teng.  My favorite color is red. I’m entering UCLA as a freshman this fall and I plan to major in Molecular Cell and Developmental Biology.  In my free time, I like to watch stand up comedy and exercise my own sense of humor.
Eric Wong
Hello, my name is Eric Wong. I’m a 2013 graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco. I’m attending the College of San Mateo and am interested in transferring to UC-Davis after two years. I intend to major in Molecular Biology with some sort of minor in business. For me, iGEM is a chance to dive straight into hands-on, innovative research. It’s a pleasure to be a part of this enormous community where we all work together to discover and create things we never imagined or thought possible.  Outside of iGEM, I read leisurely and surf the web to my heart’s content.
Super Buddies/Second Year iGEM Team
Verna Huang
Hi, my name is Verna Huang. I've loved science since 6th grade, and I hope to expand my interest in science through iGEM. This is my second year in the iGEM competition as part of the UCSF team. When I’m not geeking out over synthetic biology, I like to read fiction of any kind, draw my surroundings, and swim. I am currently a second year student at UC-Santa Barbara, possibly majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
JI Weiyue
My name is JI Weiyue and I’m a senior undergraduate from Peking University majoring in Life Sciences. Impressed by the marvelous biological phenomena and the ways scientists may accurately control and freely engineer living systems, I joined the 2011 Peking iGEM team and have been working in the field of synthetic biology ever since. This summer at UCSF, I have had the great opportunity to improve my scientific skills and develop new connections. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading various kinds of books and playing the piano.
Kendall Kearns
Hi there! My name is Kendall Kearns. I love food, sleep, the color blue, music, art, and hanging out with friends and family. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, reading, Olympic-style weightlifting or working out, and cooking! I've always loved science, probably since I started watching “The Magic School Bus” every morning in elementary and middle school. I'm currently attending UC-Irvine, possibly majoring in Microbiology and Immunology. I might also want to minor in something else, but I'm not sure yet! This is my second year competing with the UCSF iGEM team.
