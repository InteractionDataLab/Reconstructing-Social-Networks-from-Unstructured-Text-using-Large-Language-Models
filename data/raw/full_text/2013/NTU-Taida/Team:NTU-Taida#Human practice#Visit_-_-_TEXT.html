Department of Laboratory Medicine
Introduction
Laboratory medicine is indispensable in modern medical science. Laboratory medicine can present scientific data to verify or rule out a certain diagnosis, guide and monitor treatment, and evaluate the severity and prognosis of a disease. It is also valuable in mass screening and can discover subjects with risk factors for early detection of diseases and treatment. The Department of Laboratory Medicine did not exist before World War II. At that time laboratory tests were performed not in a central lab, but in various small laboratories in clinical departments, by junior clinical doctors. The Department of Laboratory Diagnosis and the Department of Medical Technology of Medical College, National Taiwan University, were first established in August 1956, to provide laboratory tests for patients and education for students of medical college.
The Department of Laboratory Medicine consists of the following divisions:
Stat laboratory
Biochemistry
Hematology
Virology
Microbiology
Transfusion & transplantation medicine
Phlebotomy & EKG
Clinical microscopy & cytology
Molecular diagnosis, immunology & quality control
