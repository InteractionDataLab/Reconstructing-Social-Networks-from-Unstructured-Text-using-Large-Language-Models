Team Introduction
We are NTU-Taida, formed by members throughout first-year undergraduates to second year graduate school students. We come from different departments in NTU, including medical college, college of lifescience, college of liberal arts and college of electrical engineering and computer science and even the college of management. We are a group of students being interested in synthetic biology and willing to devote our passion to create something interesting and useful in this wonderful area. we are glad to have the chance to realize our ideas through the iGEM platform.
