Variance-based Sensitivity Analysis
Introduction to Variance-based sensitivity analysis
The aim of sensitivity analysis is to examine which parameter in a model affects output most. In our model, there are 18 parameters (shown below) that have impact on GFP concentrations. The mathematical basis of variance-based sensitivity analysis is to estimate the effect of a parameter using variance. That is, how much portion of variance of GFP could the variance of a particular parameter explain?
Let $$ X = \{x_i\}|_{i=1}^{n} $$ be n parameters in out model, and that these parameters are in interval [0,1] by transformation. It can be assumed that output $$ y = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) $$ can be decomposed as summation of several functions:
$$ f(X) = f_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i) + \sum_{i<j}^n f_{i,j}(x_i,x_j) + \ldots  $$
By assumption of independence, one can derive: $$ \int_0^1 f_{i_1,i_2,\ldots , i_s} (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \ldots , x_{i_s})  dx_{i_k} = 0 \mbox{ for } k = 1 \mbox{ to } s $$
where $$ \{i_a\}|_{a=1}^s $$ is a sequence. For example, if $$ s=2, i_1=2, i_2=5 $$ then the former formula is equivalent to $$ \int_0^1 f_{2,5} (x_{2}, x_{5})  dx_{2} = 0 \mbox{ and} \int_0^1 f_{2,5} (x_{2}, x_{5})  dx_{5} = 0 $$
This assumption implies orthogonality, which makes calculations of expected value much easier due to orthogonality:
$$ \begin{cases}  E(y) = f_0  \\  E(y|x_i) = f_0 + f_i  \\  E(y|x_i,x_j) = f_0 + f_i + f_j + f_{i,j} \mbox{ and so on}  \end{cases} $$
Therefore, the variance can be derived as follows: $$ Var(y) = E(y^2) - (E(y))^2 = \int_{K^n} f^2 dX - f_0^2 = D $$
Let D be abbreviation of integral defined below $$ D_{i_1, i_2 \ldots , i_s} = \int_0^1\int_0^1\ldots\int_0^1 f_{i_1, i_2 \ldots , i_s}^2 dx_{i_1} \ldots dx_{i_s}. $$
Then the variance of output, denoted as D, will be: $$ D = \sum_{i=1}^n D_i + \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=i+1}^n D_{i,j} + \ldots + D_{1,\ldots , n} $$
The index of how much portion of variance of GFP could the variance of a particular parameter explain is: $$ S_i = \dfrac{D_i}{D} $$
