Introduction
Bacterial infection is the invasion of the body by pathogenic bacteria, which causes pneumonia, urethral infection, bacteremia and other symptoms in hospital and community. The efficiency of traditional detection and diagnostic approaches is impeded by the time-consuming laboratory procedures, yet many of which grow poorly in bacterial cultures. All these limitations call for a new rapid and direct bacterial identification method to improve patient management and antimicrobial therapy.  Quorum sensing is a type of bacterial cell-cell communication correlates with the population size. Many bacteria have one or several species-specific quorum sensing molecules released in different growth state and environment. Quorum sensing signals are shown to be involved in many physiological functions, including virulence, biofilm formation and drug-resistance. We aim to establish a novel bacterial identification method in clinical samples based on the quorum sensing profiles.
