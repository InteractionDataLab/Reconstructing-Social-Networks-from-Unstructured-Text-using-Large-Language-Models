Rhl (C4-AHL) sensor with positive feedback-loop tested but failed. The problems may resulted from
Incomplete dissolution of C4-AHL chemicals. Adjust the pH to the optimal.
Insensitivity of the construct itself
8.5
Found out that store the microtiter plate inside a plastic bag and cover it with aluminum foil would minimize the evaporation of the organic solvent, making the concentration more stable.
8.16
Signals from Rhl (C4-AHL) sensor were barely detected. SDS-PAGE was performed to do some semi-quantitative trouble-shooting. We contact team NYMU for help.
8.20
The function of basic Rhl sensor was assayed. Seems it worked.
9.2
Contact Dr. Hsueh for obtaining clinical isolates for further experiments. AHL quantal-dose and temporal responses completed.
9.6
Function of BBa_K575033 measured by flow cytometry
9.12-9.25
QS molecule composition of conditioned media of clinical isolates detected by our constructs and old biobricks, including those for Rhl, Lux, Las and Pqs.
Helped Team NYMU to do some functional assays
9.26
Function of Rhl circuits (Normal, PFL, CI) were measured by flow cytometry
