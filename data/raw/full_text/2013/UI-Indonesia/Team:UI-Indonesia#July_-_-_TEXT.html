What to do:
Resuspend plasmids from the iGEM kit
Transform to E.coli cell
Store the remaining suspended plasmid
Reagents and equipments
Reagents
Distilled water
Ice
50 µL competent cells for parts of choice
50 µL competent cells for positive control
Positive control
SOC Media
Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic
§ NOTE: this needs to be prepared beforehand.
Equipments
10 and 200 µL pipettes
Timer
Water bath (420C)
Procedures
Resuspending the part
Mark the location of the parts using a pen  or marker
Punch a hole through the foil using a pipette tip
Add 10µL of dH2O
Mix thoroughly by aspirating up and down a few times
Inoculating the DNA
Add 1µL of the suspended DNA to the competent cells
§ The competent cells must be kept on ice before and after the addition of the suspended DNA § Make sure to mark the lid of the eppendorf tube, which tube is filled with C.C +DNA and which tube is filled with positive control.
Add positive control to the competent cells
§ ASK: What strain of E.coli are we going to use as the competent cell? E.coli codon plus? Top10? BL21? pLysS?
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
Heatshock in water bath for 1 minute
Incubate on ice for 5 min
Add 200 µL of SOC media to each transformation
§ ASK: Is it available in IHVCB? If SOC media is not available, can we replace it with regular LB broth?
Incubate for 2 hours at 370C
Plate out the tranformation
Plate 20 µL to one agar plate, and the remainder to the separate plate.
Use beads to spread evenly
Incubate overnight (16hrs) at 370C
§ ASK: What antibiotics do we need? Is it available in IHVCB?
Store the remaining resuspended parts
§ ASK: In what temperature do we keep the resuspended part?
July 7th
Making 20 plates of LB Agar with Chlorampenicol added (Chloramphenicol concentration = 25 &#956;g/mL
July 9th
Resuspending the parts we need
Transforming the plasmid into E.coli top 10 cells
Spread the transformed cells into LB Agar Plates containing appropriate antibiotics
July 10th
- No growth in positive control plate for ampicillin  - Growth in negative control on chloramphenicol  - No growth on RBS plate   ○ Possiblity: contamination  - Miniprep for isolation   ○ 2 tubes (orange cap) @4mL broth + 4μL amp   ○ 5 tubes (blue c ap) @4mL broth + 2 μL chl   ○ 5 tubes (blue cap) @4mL broth + 2 μL IHVCB chl
July 11st
Today's to do list:
Running electrophoresis
&#9675; CHECK THE PROTOCOL
Prepare another agar plates (chloramphenicol ..., ampicilin ...)
Re-transform!
&#9675; ASK: what's wrong with the other plates? Wrong dosage of antibiotics? Contamination?
§ Check the concentration of the chloramphenicol needed for each plate
&#9633; Checked, 1: 2000 § The previous agar plates only has 1:4000 concentration of antibiotics § The previous antibiotic was diluted in H2O, while there is a source which mentions that they use 25 mg/mL chloramphenicol diluted in 100% ethanol § Possible reason as to why extreme growth are observed in chloramphenicol plates &#9675; Prepare agar plates for 5 chloramphenicol resistant plasmids and 2 ampicillin resistant plasmids, plus positive and negative control for each antibiotic.
§ Plates needed: 10 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 18 plates -> make 20, + 2 amp -> 12:8 § 240mL agar for chloramphenicol, 160 mL agar for ampicilin
What we did:
Make another 6 plates of agar +amp and 12 plates agar +chl (+1 plate +amp for kak Gema)
Isolating the plasmids from transformed E.coli
Running the plasmid (failed)
July 12nd
• Electrophoresis iGEM plasmid

Re-transform the plasmid
July 16th
Checking the plates -> contamination
Making new agar plates
July 17th
Primer designing
Preparing to make competent cells
July 22nd
- Re-run                               Well 1: marker                 Well 2: alfa 1/2 (colony/transform)                 Well 3: alfa 2/2                 Well 4: full 1/2 Well 5: full 2/2                 Well 6: alfa 1/3                 Well 7: alfa 2/3                 Well 8: full 1/3                 Well 9: full 2/3
July 23rd

July 25th
Large scale isolation for LacZfull
Inoculating RFP
July 26th
ul>
Running LacZ full and lacZ alpha
Inoculating lacZ alpha
Find restriction site with buffer compatible with EcoRI XbaI SpeI and PstI
July 27th

Making agarose
Electrophoresis
From the UV reading of the agar, we found that the plasmid is transformed into the cell. We decided to linearize the plasmid
July 30th
