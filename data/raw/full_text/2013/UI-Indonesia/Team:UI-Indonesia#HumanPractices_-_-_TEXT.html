UI Student Synthetic Biology Group
UI Indonesia iGEM team is currently trying to establish a student synthetic biology club in Universitas Indonesia, which is the first of its kind in Indonesia. The primary goal of the club itself is to increase the academic society's awareness to the importance of synthetic biology. There will be a routine meeting to discuss about the potential, safety, application and future of synthetic biology, especially in Indonesia. The group will also plan and work on a project on summer, to be finally sent as UI’s delegation for the next iGEM competition.
The secondary goal of the club is to provide stable funding for competing in iGEM competition annually. As the first iGEM team from Universitas Indonesia, we experience difficulties in finding sponsors and donors to fund our project. Thus, UI student synthetic biology group is founded to give better direction to synthetic biology research in UI, and consequently attract sponsors and donors.
The goal of the club itself is to provide stable funding for competing in iGEM competition annually as well as to increase the academic society's awareness to the importance of synthetic biology.
We have talked to our professors and several key persons in Universitas Indonesia and we have gained their support. We also have done a small scale publication to our peers about iGEM competition and the response is greatly beyond expectation. They would really love to work on a real research project, but they dont know where to go or where to find research funding since support for research is very scarce in Indonesia. This is where UI Student Synthetic Biology Group will play it’s role to provide lab facility and sufficient funding for research.
