August 5th
Performing PCR gradient for alpha fragment and omega fragment with and without linker
Temperatures used for the PCR are 510C, 54.50C, 60.20C, 63.90C, 670C and 69.50C
Running electrophoresis to check the result
The bands were very thin, so we decided to re-PCR the alpha and omega fragment
August 6th
Linearizing LacZ full from 3rd coloni in the replica (third transformation)
PCR alpha and omega fragment with and without linker
Temperatures used for the PCR are 500C, 53.20C, 55.50C, 61.00C, 66.80C, and 68.40C
Running electrophoresis
The thickest band was shown at 53.20C for alpha fragment and at 500C for omega fragment. Hence the temperatures said above will be used for PCR using Taq HiFi
August 12th
Running
We got bands with correct length, however we got thin bands on well containing omega fragment of beta galactosidase. We decided to do large scale PCR using PFx the next day.
August 13th
Large scale PCR (50μL) using PFx enzyme with annealing temperature at 53.20C for alpha fragment, 500C for omega fragment and omega fragment+linker
Running electrophoresis
We got the correct length for all fragments
August 14th
Large scale PCR (50μL) using PFx enzyme with annealing temperature at 53.20C for alpha fragment, 500C for omega fragment and omega fragment+linker
Running electrophoresis:
Correct length for all fragments
Restricting pQE80L using PstI
We use three tubes, each of them containing PstI with different volume: 0.5 μL, 5 μL, and without any enzyme added for negative control.
§ This step was done in order to check the enzyme, because we are using PstI that had past its expiration date.
Running the restricted PCR
The result shows that the PstI is no longer in a good condition. For 1 hr incubation period, the restriction using 0.5μL PstI does not produce the correct length of pQE 80L (4751 bp)
Incubating the restricted pQE80L overnight
This step was done in order to check the activity of the enzyme in extended period.
August 15th
Moving the pQE 80L + PstI into -400C freezer
Purifying the fragments (alpha+linker, omega, omega+llinker)from the PCR products using Low Melting Point Agarose (LMA) method.
August 16th
Running the incubated pQE 80L + PstI
The enzyme works with extended time of incubation. However, star activity is also observed. Hence, we look up on the internet and found that PstI can still works for extender period of incubation up to 4 hours.
August 17th
Checking the isolated fragments' concentration using Nanodrop 2000
Alpha fragment concentration: 17.1 ng/μL
Omega fragment concentration: 18.8 ng/μL
Omega+linker fragment concentration: 17.1 ng/μL
