Our project is totally an undergraduate project. All the works in our group are done by undergraduate, starting from brainstorming the idea, wet work on the bench, lab troubleshooting, constructing wiki as well as sponsors and donors hunting, It has been a long project but it is totally rewarding. We have fun and learn a lot of things. All of team members have increase the lab work skills, journal reading skills as well as negotiating skills.
