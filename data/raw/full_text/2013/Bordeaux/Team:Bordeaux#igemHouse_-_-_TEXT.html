Description
Synthetic Biology and House of the future Since its creation, Igem has led to the birth of many projects. Every year, many of them could be seen as tools for everyday life in a near future. From this point of view, we imagined the “house of the future”, in which many of Igem projects have their place. It is surprising to see how many projects could be integrated in this house. To illustrate that, let us show what we imagined with some of the 2010 projects.The concept can be enlarged to other years in order to add value to all of these projects.
