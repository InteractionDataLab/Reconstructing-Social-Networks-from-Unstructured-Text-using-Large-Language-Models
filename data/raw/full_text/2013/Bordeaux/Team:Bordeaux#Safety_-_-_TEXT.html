Team name:
iGEM Bordeaux 2013
Organism name and strain name or number : Pantoe aagglomerans
Organism Risk Group: 2
If you are using this organism as a chassis, write "chassis". If you are using a genetic part from the organism, give the name of the part and a brief description of what it does and why you are using it.
BBa_K274100 and BBa_K274110 convert colourless farnesyl pyrophosphate to red lycopene to get colored medium, here the yogurt.
How did you physically acquire the organism or part? Available in 2012 Distribution kit
What potential safety/health risks to team members, other people at your institution, or the general public could arise from your use of this organism/part?
None, the enzymes products are not dangerous for human or environment.
What measures do you intend to take to ensure that your project is safe for team members, other people at your institution, and the general public?
We intend to verify the amount of lycopene released in the yogurt and that it is not produced without the induction of the promoter.
If you are using only a part from the organism, and you believe the part by itself is not dangerous, explain why you believe it is not dangerous.
These enzymes product colored molecules that are present in other foods and have never been reported to be harmfull.
Why do you need to use this organism/part? Is there an organism/part from a less dangerous Risk Group that would accomplish the same purpose?
This part was available and easy to get. We could have extracted it from another organism, but the system is easier to clone from a bacteria to another.
Is the organism/part listed under the Australia Group guidelines, or otherwise restricted for transport? If so, how will your team ship this part to iGEM and the Jamborees? No.
Please describe the BioSafety Level of the lab in which the team works, or description of safety features of lab (Refer to Basic Safety form, question 8. d.). If you are using organisms with a BSL level greater than you lab, please explain any additional safety precautions you are taking.
Our lab is a level 1. No organism with a BSL level greater than 1 was used, and the parts here described cannot be considered as dangerous.
