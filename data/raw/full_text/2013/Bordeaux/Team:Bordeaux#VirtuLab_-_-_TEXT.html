Virtual LAB
For large teams with complicated assemblies strategies or team member rotating without easy way to keep track of what has been done it can be difficult to keep track of what step has been accomplished and which one is left to be done. We have created the Virtual Lab : a dedicated Online Information Management System to help Igem teams visualize the progress of their project in real time and share with their off-site team members.
