Team:Korea U Seoul/Notebook sub
From 2013.igem.org
March
1. Introduction to iGEM
- About synthetic biology : As an automobile can be described as assembly of numerous parts, synthetic biology is a field of assembled techniques from division of biotechnology. One of benefits offered in this field is that we can use necessary parts with lack of knowledge to specifics of each technique.
- Look around 2012 iGEM teams' posters, wiki pages
2. Division of roles
1) Experiment : Minseob Yoo, Hyeyeong Choi, Junhong Jang, Hyunsong Kim, Jihee Park, Juyoung Ha
2) Human Practice : Hyunsong Kim, Jihee Park, Hyeyeong Choi, Minseob Yoo
3) Creative Challenger Program (CCP) : Juyoung Han, Minseob Yoo, Hyunsong Kim
4) Design : Minseob Yoo
5) Modeling : Dongha Kim, Minwhan Yoo, Jonghee Chun
6) Fundraising : Kyengwoo Jang, Dongha Kim, Junhong Jang, Jihee Park
7) Clerk : Hyunsong Kim
8) Photographer : Jihoon Jeong
3. Fix meeting dates
- Meeing will be on every Monday, 7:00 p.m, lecture room 121 Life Science Division West building
4. Studying iGEM
- All members choose one team's result from past iGEM and make a presentation about it.

April
1. Ideas
(1) Keywords 
- We made bulletin board at our website that we can easily search ideas
Kyengwoo Jang : Cyanobacteria+Rhodopsin, Acetic acid
Junhong Jang : MSG
Hyunsong Kim : Shwanella+Nano Silver
Juyoung Han : Aluminum
Jihoon Jeong : Proteorhodopsin
Jihee Park : Endospore inner membrane
Hyeyeong Choi : Food waste odor, Nuclear waste breakdown
(2) Teamwork
-We made team to think systemically
Group 1 (Jihoon Jeong, Minseob Yoo) : CaCO3, AR system
Group 2 (Jihee Park, Hyeyeong Choi, Kyengwoo Jang, Minseob Yoo, Juyoung Han) : Nonylphenol, SPR sensor, Lignin β-keto adipate pathway
Group 3 (Junhong Jang, Kyengwoo Jang, Hyunsong Kim, Juyoung Han) : Bio-hoil
Group 4 (Jihoon Jeong, Jaeuk Han, Minseob Yoo, Dongha Kim) : Bio-wire
We consolidated group 3&4 to the topic of nano metal producing by microbes
2. Human Practice
- Vote for Best 3 Human Practice from last year : Cornell, Calgary, LMU-Munich
May
1. Decide topic
- Minseob Yoo
: conchiolin is major protein of pearl
There are two types of crystal structures of CaCO3, calcite and aragonite
Nacerin automatically gathers and produce aragonite
We will further search :
1) How CaCO3 makes aragonite
2) Conditions for gloss
3) Exact mechanism of making pearl by pearl shell
4) Method of making layers
5) Accurate role of colchiolin and possibility of producing it.
2. Human Practice
- Undergraduate essay contest : K water, Bioneer challenge, Samsung human-tech
June
Things to do
- Decide team logo & Order team T-shirt
- Homepage making (Contents)
- Festival at Yongsan youth center : Dongha Kim, Hyunsong Kim, Jihee Park
July
1. New name for Korea University biosynthetic academy
- Korea University Association of Synthetic biology (KUAS)
2. Role allocation
1) Sponsor :
in the school - Jihoon Jeong
outside the school - Dongha Kim, Junhong Jang, Jonghee Chun
2) Writing reports : Juyoung Han
3) CCP : Jihee Park, Hyunsong Kim, Juyoung Han, Minseob Yoo
4) Plans in Hongkong : Jihoon Jeong
5) Translation into English : Hyunsong Kim
6) Wiki contents : Minseob Yoo, Kyengwoo Jang, Jaeuk Han
