Design & Part
We try to express the pearl gene (nacrein) on the E.coli, and check the CaCO3-E.coli structrue. The gene related to nacrein was made by the genetic synthetic technology and go through codon optimization step which for expression of E.coli.
pAT vector is the vector which can express the protein on surface of cell. We made vectors containing 4type of nacrein. The promotor of protien expression was pBAD, so we used arabinose for expression.
Before checking the functioning of Nacrein protein which displayed on cell, purify 4type of nacrein protein and check functioning of them.
