Idea
The global warming is the serious problem todays. Its the phenomenon which methane, CO2 and other green-house gases, caused from industrialization, increase the average temperature. 
we should realize the seriousness of the situation and strive to decrease CO2. CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) is one of these efforts. 
Our members decided to convert CO2 to pearl.  And we are making pearl-coli from this aspect using pearl oyster, pinctada fucata.
