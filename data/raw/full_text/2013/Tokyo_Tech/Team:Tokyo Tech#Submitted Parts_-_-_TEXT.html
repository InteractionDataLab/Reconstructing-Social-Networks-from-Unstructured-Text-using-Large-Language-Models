Best new BioBrick part (natural and engineered): BBa_K1139021
Fig. 5-1-1. Design of phage DNA for inducible phage release pSB3K3 backbone is required for maintenance of the DNA without inducer.
M13 is a non-litic phage that infects only F+ strains of E. coli, which does not kill the host cell. This BioBrick part is extracted from M13mp18 phage vector by PCR. It includes 11 ORFs, M13 origin, a packaging sequence and lac promoter. The promoter upstream of g2p (gene 2 protein) is altered to lux promoter. A phage particle is formed only when the host cell receives AHL signal (3OC6HSL, C6) because G2p (gene 2 protein) is an endonuclease which is needed for a plasmid to be replicated by M13 origin, and to be packaged into the phage particle. As a reporter, GFP is inserted downstream of the lac promoter.
Best new BioBrick part (natural): BBa_K1139020
We confirmed that M13 phage genes and M13 origin worked properly with pSB origin, using a plaque forming assay.  One is replacement of the promoter for upstream of g2p with a constitutive promoter, PlacIq ( BBa_I14032 ).  The other is accommodation of pSB3K3 backbone. Even though the plasmid has two different types of replication origins, M13 origin and pSB3 origin, this plasmid ( BBa_K1139020 , Fig. 5-1-2) formed plaque.  In contrast, construction intermediates without a promoter for g2p coding sequence (Promoterless-M13 + Plac, Promoterless-M13 + Plac-GFP BBa_K1139022 , Fig. 5-1-3) could not form plaque.

Best improved part and Best new BioBrick part (natural):
BBa_K1139201
We improved a phosphate sensor part since the existing phosphate sensor part (OUC-China 2012, BBa_K737024 ) did not have sufficient data.  We constructed this part by amplifying the phoA promoter from E. coli (MG1655) and ligating it upstream of GFP part. Compared to OUC-China’s phosphate sensor part including phoB promoter (Fig. 5-1-5), our phosphate sensor part shows a clearer result (Fig. 5-1-4).
A sensor of phosphate concentration is valuable for various studies in synthetic biology.  Therefore, our improved part will be useful.

Best new BioBrick part (engineered): BBa_K1139110
We constructed BBa_K1139110 by combining Pcon-lasR ( BBa_K553003 ) and Plux/tet-GFP ( BBa_K934025 ). This is the first BioBrick part that succeeded in confirming the circumvention of crosstalk between 3OC12HSL-LasR complex and lux promoter. Using this part with plasmid that is constitutively expressing luxR and tetR, we succeeded in confirming the circumvention of crosstalk LasR to lux promoter.

We have constructed a series of parts, BBa_1139019 , BBa_1139020 , BBa_1139021 , BBa_1139022 , BBa_1139023 , BBa_1139025 and BBa_1139026 . BBa_1139022 is constructed from BBa_1139019 . BBa_1139020 has a constitutive promoter upstream of BBa_1139022 . BBa_1139023 and BBa_1139025 have an inducible promoter upstream of BBa_1139019 . Moreover, BBa_1139021 and BBa_1139026 have an inducible promoter upstream of BBa_1139022 .These three parts are confirmed to work accurately in our circuits and are expected to enable DNA messaging.
You would be able to transmit desired DNA to the desired place by using our parts.
