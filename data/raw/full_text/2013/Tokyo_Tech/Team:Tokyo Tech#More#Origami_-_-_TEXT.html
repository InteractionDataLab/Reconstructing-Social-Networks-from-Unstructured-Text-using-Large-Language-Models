Origami
Did you get shuriken made of origami? If you did, let's try to make it by YOURSELF! If you didn't, you have to get shuriken by making YOURSELF!
Now, let's check how to make shuriken made of origami. You can easily make it! If you want to make shuriken in Tokyo Tech design, please download the following design.
1. Preparation
Origami (15cm x 15cm paper)
Scissors or a cutter (to cut the origami)
Tokyo Tech's original design for shuriken
2. How to make shuriken
1.
Cut the origami along the line.
Each piece will have one star printed.
If the center line of our design is out of position, cut the printed line, not the center of the origami.
2.
Look at the left part first. Fold it in half.
If the center line of our design is out of position, fold on the center of the origami, not the printed line.
3.
Fold on the dash line so that the green lines come in contact with each other. You will have the origami shaped as shown in the next picture.
4.
Fold the other side on the dash line too.
5.
The lower picture shows the reverse side of the upper picture.
Fold along the dash lines so that you form triangles.
6.
Fold the top triangles over the dash lines. Crease and unfold.
7.
Fold it in half.
8.
Fold on the dash line so that the green lines come in contact with each other. You will have the origami shaped as shown in the next picture.
9.

10.
Fold along the dash lines so that you form triangles.
11.
Fold the top triangles over the dash lines. Crease and unfold.

13.
Fold the bottom paper over on both ends and fit them under the upper one's flap.
14.
Your origami should be like in the picture.
15.
Flip the paper over and fold the bottom paper over on both ends and fit them under the upper one's flap again.
16.
You will finish soon…
17.
After all your hard work, you will get your own shuriken!
If you use two different color origamis, you can make bicolor shuriken.
3. Attention
You must not throw shuriken at people.
