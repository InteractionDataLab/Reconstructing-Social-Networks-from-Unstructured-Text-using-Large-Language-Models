We are team Tokyo Tech!
We are proud to say that all of the ideas we worked on this summer were proposed by undergraduate members of our own team.   We also want to thank all those advisors and instructors who helped us discuss these ideas and guided us through doing the experiments.  The whole experimental data produced by team Tokyo Tech 2013 comes from experiments carried out all by undergraduates.
The ideas of "Crosstalk circumvention" "M13 phage" and "Farming" were all proposed by undergraduate members of our team (Emma Hatanaka, Tatsuhiro Isozaki and Ryota Fujiwara).  Modeling related to "Crosstalk circumvention" and "Farming" were also done by undergraduate students (Yochiku Shi).
--Student team members--

Contribution
--General support--
Prof. Kiga was letting us use his lab for some our experiments.  He also led us to get dazzling results in iGEM competition too.
Prof. Yamamura and Prof. Konagaya supported us in many ways to give us a better researching life.
Prof. Ayukawa gave us an experimental environment that we could be satisfied.
Mr. Sekine and Mr. Amikura gave us the helpful advice for playing an active part in iGEM competition.
Promega provided us the part of restriction enzyme we used at no charge.
Mr. J. Collins provided us JM2.300.
National Institute of Genetics provided us MG1655.
--Instrumental analysis support--
Biomaterial Analysis Center, Technical Department, sequenced the sequence of plasmids which we had asked.
Mr. Sei is working in Tokyo Institute of Technology Center for Advanced Materials Analysis. He gave us a technical guidance of UPLC and provided the equipment.
--Plant hormone support--
Integrated DNA Technologies was synthesized gene, AtIPT4 and AtIPT7 which we had asked.
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. sold us cytokinins (iP and tZ) and Auxin (IAA).
-- Cucumis sativus L. support--
Bio Creative Design Room of Tokyo Tech gave us equipment (pestles and mortars) and reagents (IAA, CK, acetone and DMSO).
Prof. Ohta was letting us use his darkroom for some experiments.  He also gave us advice on bioassay too.
Collaboration Center for Design and Manufacturing of Tokyo Tech was letting us use its lab for our bioassay.
--Human Practice support--
Mr. Katayama who is working in Tokyo Institute of Technology Graduate School of Innovation Management gave us his opinion on issues of environmental and beneficiary survey of our projects.
Mr. Kawabata who is working in JA ZENNOH CHIBA advised what problems and benefits will be occurred if our project was applied.
Takeda Science Foundation introduced us in their book.
Mr. Sato (a teacher of Shinjuku high school) proposed the experimental classroom , and led us.
Ms. Inoue (a teacher of Sagamihara high school) and Ms. Miyamoto (a teacher of Toin Gakuen) collected lots of high school students to our experimental classroom .
--And last but not least--
We would like to thank all the people who came to our progress presentations and gave useful feedback and input:
Fumio Arisaka, Toshiaki Fukui, Takeshi Hata, Junji Hirota, Hiroshi Iwasaki, Satoshi Nakamura, Shunichiro Ogura, Hideki Taguchi, Masahiro Takinoue, Yasunori Tanji, Hirokazu Urabe, Masaaki Wachi, Robert F. Whittier, Daniel Berrar, Mai Miura, Taku Nakayama, Goshi Sugano, Naoki Tsukuda and Nobuaki Yasuo.
