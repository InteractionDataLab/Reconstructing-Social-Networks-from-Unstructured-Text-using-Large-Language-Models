Judging Form
We made M13 part collection and showed several parts for example. This part collection will be important for information processing.
( See more about the M13 part collection )
Design of phage DNA for inducible phage release, pSB3K3 backbone is required for maintenance of the DNA without inducer.
We performed a stochastic simulation for our ninja circuit which will be important for information processing.
( See more about the stochastic simulation )
