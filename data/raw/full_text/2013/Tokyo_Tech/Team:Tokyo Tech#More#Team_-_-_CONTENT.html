</DIV><DIV class="box"><H1>Team Members</H1><H2><P>
			This year, our team Tokyo Tech consists of various members. We have sophomore, junior and senior students, and also have a member from another University. We spent the whole fantastic summer holiday to prepare for this competition. We have been experimenting and discussing from early mornings to late nights every day, and shared the roles within a limited time to attain our goal. Although we experienced numerous difficulties in carrying out the project, we had very fulfilling days. Here, we would like to introduce our team members.

								This is my first time to go abroad, so I feel so excited about it. I am looking forward to meeting and talking with other students who are studying biotechnology. </P><P>Although I am a leader of team Tokyo Tech, I always sweep our living room.
I want to invent something interesting by biotechnology. I think there are plenty of things for me to do to realize my dream

								There is no doubt that I am studying and doing researches very hard. But to be honest, those are not my whole life. Actually, I like playing baseball, soccer and many kinds of sports. iGEM is a wonderful opportunity for me to share our ideas with other teams, and I hope we will accomplish a good result. Of course I am also looking forward to talking with you.

I want to expand my interest and knowledge through this contest, and I want to know more about the system science at the same time. In the future, I wish I could be a good researcher and make achievements in complex area of biology and mathematics.
I like reading some political science or playing &quot;Go.&quot; Especially, I like animation very much.

								I've never had the chance to take part in a competition like iGEM before, so this is a good opportunity to challenge myself as a researcher. I worked hard on designing the gene circuit, and I hope it works in both experiments and in modeling. I may continue on to a lab that does totally different things from what I am doing with iGEM now, but I hope that I will have wonderful memories of this project. </P><P>Outside of iGEM, I like playing electronic games and watching Japanese movies. I am really looking forward to my trips to Hong Kong and to Boston. I probably won't have a lot of extra time, but I would like to go shopping and try different types of food while I'm there.

								To see the big picture of research, I decided to participate in iGEM. I am fond of so many things. For instance, Mahjong, horse racing and baseball. I also like karaoke very much. Now I am looking forward to PokemonXY.</P><P>In fact, I have magnificent dreams. I want to travel to the Mars, conquer the world, and even make the time go back. I hope I can make it.

								I am a student from WASEDA University.  I always feel interested in elucidating the mechanisms of the human brain. In the future, I want to be an exceptional researcher.</P><P>iGEM is like a challenge for me, because I want to find out what we are able to do in working as a team. I am eager to take this chance to make some new microorganisms with my own hands with my partners. I am sure we will get the prize we want.

								I am a sophomore student majoring bioscience. My dream is to contribute to agriculture with biotechnology. To achieve my dream, I joined team Tokyo Tech this year. With our hard work, I am confident of getting into the finalist.</P><P>In leisure time, I like walking my dog around my house and watching him play with other dogs. Also, I am fond of soccer and tennis. Recently, as I have to do a lot of experiments, I could rarely go home. So I really miss my mom's home cooking!

								iGEM is an excellent chance to improve myself, I would like to go outside to expand my horizons. At the same time, it also could be an opportunity to improve my own creativity. And I feel excited about going aboard to communicate with other students from all countries. Now I keen to study about microorganism and frogs.</P><P>In my spare time, I also like watching entertainment programs.

I also like producing or processing images by illustrator.</P><P>If you ask me what my favorite book is, I will definitely say it is Harry Potter series. I got fascinated by the whole magic world. I wish I could be a witch just like them, and use magic to travel all around the world. A new Harry Potter theme park will be opened in Osaka, so I have to go and enjoy there!
