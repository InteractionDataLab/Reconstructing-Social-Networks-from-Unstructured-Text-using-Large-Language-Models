Thank You
We would like to extend a very special thank you to all the people and organizations that have generously shared their time, support, and knowledge with our group over the course of this last year.  Without your help we would not have been able to achieve rising levels of success that we have seen to this point.  As we set out on our journey towards developing our business, the Synbiologica group has seen nothing but a willingness to help and educate.  Whether it has been within the university, out in the local community of Lethbridge, across the province and even beyond we have been presented with willing support and advice where ever it was needed.  The people and groups below have provided us with advice, guidance, and feedback, training and skills development, In-kind gifts and services, and financial support.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to acknowledge the following people and groups for their close involvement and support towards our project.

Thank you to The University of Lethbridge and the University Liaison and Technology Transfer Office, with special thanks to Morgan Guo, for their ongoing support in providing us with laboratory space, prior art and patent ability assessments, and allowing us to maintain full rights to our patents.
