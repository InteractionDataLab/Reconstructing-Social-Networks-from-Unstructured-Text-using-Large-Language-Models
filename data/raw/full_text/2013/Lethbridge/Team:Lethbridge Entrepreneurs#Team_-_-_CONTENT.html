In this last year alone, Isaac Ward, Erin Kelly and Mackenzie Coatham acted as advisors for the Lethbridge High School iGEM team. The High School team engineered <I>E. coli</I> to produce the peptide hormone Oxytocin and its precursor protein.
									They were extremely successful, winning Best New Biobrick - Natural, Best Wiki and the First Place Green Brick at the High School Jamboree.</P><P>Harland Brandon is an advisor to the Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team, who have also been quite successful this year. At the North American Regional Jamboree in Toronto, Lethbridge Collegiate won Best Wiki and First Place in the overgraduate division.</P><P>All members also have experience in research labs outside of iGEM, in both neuroscience and biochemistry labs.</P><P class="red_AG">Please click on one of the following pictures to read a team member's or an advisor's bio.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="middle_AG"><DIV class="decrease_opacity"><DIV id="team_members_AG"><DIV id="the_team_AG"><H2 class="team_secondary_heading">The Team</H2></DIV><DIV id="the_advisors_AG"><H2 class="team_secondary_heading">The Advisors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="bios_AG"><DIV id="isa"><DIV class="bio_AG"><H2 class="bio_name_AG">Isaac Ward – CEO of Synbiologica</H2><DIV class="bio_write_up_AG"><P>Isaac comes to the Synbiologica team with a diverse background of experience along with a keen enthusiasm for science and innovation.

His previous experience with biochemistry was with Lethbridge High School iGEM. In High School iGEM, he was primarily involved with designing the wiki, but did perform some lab work.  This time in iGEM, he is involved with wiki design. In his free time, he likes to explore new concepts in web design, web development and programming.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="ger"><DIV class="bio_AG"><H2 class="bio_name_AG">Dr. Gerlinde Metz</H2><DIV class="bio_write_up_AG"><P>Dr. Gerlinde Metz investigates the influence of experience and environment on behaviour and brain plasticity. Her work was the first to show that stress affects motor system function and diseases of the motor system, such as Parkinson’s disease and stroke. This research indicated that adverse experience at any time in life can become a predisposing or precipitating factor of disease. More recently, her laboratory has developed a rat model of transgenerational prenatal stress. This model allows the study of transgenerational inheritance of health and disease and epigenetic linkages from early development to old age. Her contribution to Synbiologica will include work in animal models of disease and physiological manipulations and assays, and related behavioural studies.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="han"><DIV class="bio_AG"><H2 class="bio_name_AG">Dr. Hans- Joachim Wieden</H2><DIV class="bio_write_up_AG"><P>Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden is an Associate Professor of Physical Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge and an Alberta Ingenuity Faculty member.
