Research
We have begun preliminary research and development of our product. Thus far, we have expressed, purified and stored one of the proteins (protein A) with which we will develop BEAR. Currently, we are in the process of expressing our second protein (Protein B) of interest. We cannot release the names of the proteins at this time in order to protect our intellectual property.
Figure 1. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein A.        It is approximately 32 kDa in size though it appears to be appoximately 35 kDa in size.
Figure 2. Overexpression 15% SDS-PAGE of Protein B. The overexpression was not successful under the conditions we used. We will conduct several test expressions at lower temperature, lower IPTG concentration, and induce expression at different cell concentrations.
