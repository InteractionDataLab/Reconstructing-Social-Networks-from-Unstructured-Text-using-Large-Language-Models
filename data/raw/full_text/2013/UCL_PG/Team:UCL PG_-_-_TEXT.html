About iGEM
International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an annual world-wide synthetic biology competition aimed at university students. Each year, participating teams from all over the world are challenged to bring their innovative ideas to life by applying engineering methodology in life sciences to ultimately produce “Biobricks” which are modular biological circuit parts that can be utilized to solve global issues.
About us
We are a combination of dedicated graduate and master students from both UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Biochemical Engineering .
About our idea
Improvising activation of the circuit with light, evolve luminescent proteins. Allow preclinical genetic imaging to study endogenous and disease processes in vivo and to image the genetic behaviour of life.
