The concentration of the product of the enzymatic reaction was measured via absorption over 5 minutes with time steps of 10 seconds. As absorption measurements for very low substrate concentrations were almost undistinguishable from noise, we decided only to fit the data for the 6 highest concentrations. The data for the 6 highest concentration including standard deviation is shown in Figure 1.

After initial investigation of the data we realised that the ratio between the absorption in the steady states was not scaling linearly with the dilution ratios. This led us to the conclusion that there was a nonlinear relationship between the concentration of the product of the enzymatic reaction and the absorption. Hence we contacted the wetlab and they measured a calibration curve for us such that we could carry out rigorous quantitative modeling.

As the computation of the likelihood includes solving a non-trivial differential equation it is not possible to write down an analytical expression for it that could be used to estimate the parameter distributions. Hence we will have to resort to sampling from the parameter distribution. We did this using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm implemented in the adaptive MCMC toolbox DRAM [<A href="http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Haario et al. (2006)</A>].We used a burn-in of 1,000 samples and then generated 400,000 samples from the distribution. Using these samples we can also generate samples for the parameter K<SUB>M</SUB> by computing K<SUB>M</SUB> for every sample via the same formula that was used above. For visualization 500 samples out of these 200,000 are shown in Figure 6. Using these samples we used standard kernel density estimation to estimate the marginal densities of single parameters. The resulting approximate marginal distributions are shown in Figure 6.

We did this using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm implemented in the adaptive MCMC toolbox DRAM [<A href="http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Haario et al. (2006)</A>]. We used a burn-in of 1,000 samples and then generated 400,000 samples from the distribution. Using these samples we can also generate samples for the parameter K<SUB>M</SUB> by computing K<SUB>M</SUB> for every sample via the same formula that was used above. As a visualization 500 samples out of those 200,000 are shown in Figure 13. Using these samples we used kernel density estimation to estimate the marginal densities of single parameters. The resulting approximate marginal distributions are shown in Figure 14.

Moreover we see that the density rapidly drops at the boundaries of the investigated domain, which means that the domain boundaries were badly chosen. Due to the computational intensity of the uncertainty analysis we were not able to repeat this experiment, but this will be done after the Jamboree.

It can be seen that our estimates of K<SUB>M</SUB> and k<SUB>cat</SUB> diverge by several magnitudes from the values determined by the Wright group. However this can be attributed to the fact that we saw pronounce uncertainties in the estimation process. Hence the simulations of the system using the best fit parameters nevertheless yields a good approximation to the measured data. Thus these paramters are a valid choice for further analysis.
