We hoped to get inspirations for our <B>outreach</B> and <B>human practice</B> effort. Moreover we were interested in the worldwide practical realization of minimizing “the water problem”. Especially the diverse ways of approach in different countries and the existing solutions were of interest (see Figure 2) to see how our project fits into this scope. In addition to the main speeches of ambassadors from different communities and companies we participated on a workshop session with speeches and discussion called <I>“Water and Soils for Food and Energy - A Question of <B>Technological Development</B>?”</I>. 
</P><P>We realized that it is quite difficult to give a straight answer to this question. J. Bouma (formerly Wageningen University, The Netherlands) answered with <I>“No, not alone, but start with existing technology and go from there”</I>. Whereas R. Ardakanian (United Nations University, Dresden) just said <I>“yes”</I> after his speech. But not only the answers on the topic question differed, also the point of view concerning to the worldwide water problem, scarcity and the definition of common water diverged. In his speech, R. Ardakanian placed <B>water</B> in context with <B>waste</B>. He said that waste can be a resource for the production of food and energy and must contribute as <B>recycled</B> waste in technology. According to E. Adar the goal and challenge for the next generation is (Ben Gurion University, Negev, Israel) minimizing the water use and costs. To him it was evident that water is a synonym for food and a commodity, not a resource like gold.
</P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 3</B>: speech about <I>&quot;historic and future variations in global water&quot;</I> from J. Sheffield</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Furthermore M. Lange (The Cyprus Institute, Nicosia) presented his speech titled <I>&quot;Ways about Climate Change and Energy-Water Nexus in the Mediterranean&quot;</I>. A. Porporato (Duke University, NC, USA) gave a lecture on the role of <B>ecohydrological variability</B> in productivity and sustainability of ecosystems.
</P><P>The following general speeches about the water scarcity and climate change, informed the audience about different present projects to reduce the water scarcity. G. Teutsch (UFZ Leipzig) who opened the conference talked about a <I>“quick start”</I> to reduce the water scarcity, which sticks together with the urgent topic of <B>climate change</B>. The main statement of the second speaker's speech ,P. Krebs (TU Dresden), was that not visions yield viable results, but only excellent <B>concepts</B>, new <B>projects</B> and <B>community action</B>. That the water topic has also an important role in politics, was approached from F. Holzwarth, (BMU Bonn) whose goal is forming a <I>“water alliance with new individual faces”</I>. He stated that in contrast to the climate change, the water scarcity isn’t a major topic in politics, because <I>“disasters drive <B>politics</B>”</I>.  In his speech U. Weber (DFG Bonn) picked out science (project, implementation and ideas) and society (public, politic) in relation to water scarcity and climate change  as central themes. In turn, J. Sheffield (Princeton University, USA; see Figure 3) broached the issues of the transition between drought and floods.

Bidoglio(EC-JRC IES Ispra, Italy; see figure 4). Implemented Projects are the Joint Research Project SMART (integrated Water Resource Management in the Lower Jordan Valley) and the Guanting Project (sustainable water and agricultural land use in the Guanting watershed under limited water resources).
</P><P>In summary the visit of the conference made us realize that water <B>scarcity</B> and <B>water quality</B> are in fact vital problems that already attract much attention in academic circles. In contrast, we did not know that the global water situation is such a multifaceted subject and we were stunned by the broad range of subjects that were covered during the conference. As the conference took place at the beginning of our project, the impressions we received from the conference helped us <B>understanding</B> what problems we should address when talking to a broader audience in our subsequent human practice efforts.
Moreover the presentation of  currently happening innovative projects <B>inspired</B> us in the design of our filter prototypes.

During this discussion meeting we had the opportunity to meet and discuss with several experts as well as with representatives of leading German pharmacy companies such as Bayer and Novartis. The main focus of this discussion was on the point whether <B>pollution</B> of the environment by <B>pharmaceutic substances</B> is a considerable problem for our society. Furthermore whether Germany is going to <B>invest money</B> to reduce this pollution and who is responsible for financing these measures. The conclusion of this conference was that in Germany there is no acute danger for mankind by contamination of the environment by pharmaceutic substances. In contrast the lowering of the detection limit for several substances leads to an <B>awareness</B> that there is contamination caused by mankind and that several people are not willing to accept this pollution.

Experts in the fields economy, politics and science and the German iGEM teams came together at the conference and tried to answer these questions. In his speech, Dr. Helge Braun (parliamentary State Secretary of the BMBF) emphasized that a creative teamwork with an own developed <I>&quot;language&quot;</I> is necessary. He introduced the new biotechnological ideas: biological implants, biomimetic desalination plants and microbial fuel cells. In the first discussion round about the topic “result of the <B>previous activities</B> and <B>action recommendations</B> for the continuation of the initiative &quot;Biotechnology 2020+ conference&quot;, five ambassadors of five research institutions (Frauenhofer Society, Helmholtz Association, Max-Planck Society, Leibniz Association, TU Braunschweig) (see figure 5) presented their <B>recently</B> implemented <B>ideas</B>: printable biotechnology, cell-free bioproduction and synthesis of novel therapeutics. Exemplarily Prof. Dr. H. Jäckle (Max-Planck-Community) introduced the research network for Synthetic Biology MaxSynbio. The second discussion treated the subject &quot;Open Source in the Biotechnology”. After the presentation there were workshops on the topic “On the way to a Biotechnology 2020+”. Additionally the German iGEM projects 2013 were exhibitied (see Figure 6) and the five research institutions presented their recent research projects.

We wanted to <B>present our project</B>, get another impartial <B>opinion</B> concerning our project idea and project implementation and lastly acquire <B>general information</B> about practical phytoremediation. Dr. Kuschk and Dr. Müller are chair members of the environmental biotechnology section and attend to <B>phytoremediation</B> or rather bioremediation (see figure 6). Their research focus lies in the area of zoonosis that means the interplay between plants and microorganisms. The plant acts with the root system as a carrier to quantify the microorganisms which dispose nitrate, sulfur or toluol. According to Dr. Kuschk genetic engineering work isn’t possible at the UFZ, because of  the few personnel at the moment.
</P><P>
Dr. Müller gave us a guided tour through the laboratories. (see Figure 7) Later on we had two conversations with experts on different issues concerning our project. Dr. Müller gave us very helpful annotations about our <B>effectors</B>. We were explained the sense of <B>amplifying the resistance gene EreB</B> in environment in relation to the biotechnological benefit. He informed us about the costs of blue light. Furthermore he alluded that we had to consider the <B>enzyme specification</B> in order to find the benefit of extincting erythromycin to clean water. Another point was the use of <B>cathecholdioxygenase</B>. According to Dr. Müller, depletion of catechol through microorganisms is a very effective process. So our next step was to show the efficiency of the depleting catechol through moss.

Dr. Kuschk was in <B>doubt</B> about the practical implementation. His assessment was based on his comprehensive experiences with concepts and conversions he developed. In his opinion the <B>costs</B>, the low concentration of polluting substances and the small contact surface have negative effects on the projects application. When it comes to the immobilization of substances, he prefers biofilms to membrane bounds. He also criticized our choice of degraded substances. In his opinion fecal substances are the cause of the high death and diseases rate in less developed countries. We explained that we chose harmful substances, according to the WHO, to establish our filter, as we'd like to show the <B>degradation and bioaccumulation</B> of them.  In general he considered our project as basic research and not as practical application.
In summary the visit of the UFZ enriched our knowledge in the issue of molecular genetics and gave us an idea how further project thoughts could look like. The guided tour through the laboratories of UFZ showed us <B>execution examples</B> of working phytoremediation concepts.

As there is a biotech company which successfully uses <I>Physcomitrella patens</I> as a <B>production organism</B> for <B>therapeutic proteins</B> it became clear that we had to meet a responsible person of this company. Dr. Schaaf, the Principal Scientist of <A href="http://www.greenovation.com/index.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Greenovation</A> invited us for a discussion and subsequently he showed us the production facility and the other labs of Greenovation. During the meeting we discussed their work flow  for <I>Physcomitrella</I> and ours. We talked about <B>production rates</B> of therapeutic proteins and learned about its <B>cultivation conditions</B> in a bioreactor as well as in nature. During the discussion we also considered ordering the transformation of PhyscoFilter plants (so calles BryoTechnology). This <B>hypothetical collaboration</B> would have been possible and would have cost us around 50,000 to 70,000€ per effector. The price would have included the <B>DNA preparation</B>, <B>transformation</B> and <B>expression analysis</B> of 1000 clones. Beside the possibility of a collaboration with PhyscoFilter the company also holds <B>patents</B> which could, in theory, block the application of <I>Physcomitrella</I> for commercial phytoremediation.
