Academic Sponsors
Our efforts were funded by several institutions of the Technical University Munich (TUM). Their generous support enabled us to cover the initial team registration, the jamboree fees and travel expense as well as the majority of wet lab material costs.
Chair of Biological Chemistry, Prof. Dr. Skerra
We would like to thank Professor Dr. Arne Skerra, who generously granted our team laboratory space and competitive infrastructure at the chair of biological chemistry as well as his scientific supervision and guidance. His internationally acknowledged contributions and comprehensive experience in molecular biotechnology and protein design  were repeatedly awarded and his emphasis on practical application and economic use of academic research findings have led to the foundation of two biotech companies.
Wissenschaftszentrum Weihenstephan (TUM)
The Center of Life and Food Sciences Weihenstephan addresses the challenges of the 21st century such as global warming, population explosion, food security and dwindling fossil fuel reserves with a combination of fundamental and applied research as well as interdisciplinary efforts scaling from molecules across organisms towards ecosystems. Accordingly, the faculty combines expertise in biosciences, biotechnology, agronomy, forestry, ecology, ecosystem management, nutrition, food sciences and life science engineering.
Technical University of Munich (TUM)
Technische Universität München (TUM) is one of Europe’s top universities. It is committed to excellence in research and teaching, interdisciplinary education and the active promotion of promising young scientists. The university also forges strong links with companies and scientific institutions across the world. TUM was one of the first universities in Germany to be named a University of Excellence. In the international Shanghai Ranking (ARWU), TUM was rated the number one German university in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
Industry Sponsors
Biomatters
Biomatters Ltd. created one of the most powerful software-packages available for the in-silico analysis and manipulation of DNA- and protein-sequences. For the duration of iGEM 2013 competition they provided us with a license for every team-member.
Promega
With a portfolio of more than 2,500 products covering the fields of genomics, protein analysis and expression, cellular analysis, drug discovery and genetic identification, Promega is a global leader in providing innovative solutions and technical support to life scientists in academic, industrial and government settings. Originally, founded in 1978 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, Promega has branches in 15 countries and more than 50 global distributors serving 100 countries. Promega supports our iGEM Team by providing the Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System, the Vac-Man® Laboratory Vacuum Manifold, the PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep System, the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay and the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System.
New England BioLabs
New England Biolabs is a recognized world leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes for recombinant DNA technology. They kindly provided us with their NEB iGEM-Support Kit including the Quick-Load 2-Log DNA Ladder (0.1-10.0 kb), the BioBrick Assembly Kit (incl.  restriction enzymes EcoRI-HF, PstI, SpeI, XbaI as well as T4 DNA Ligase), Antarctic Phosphatase and the Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix.
Eurofins
Eurofins MWG Operon, part of the Eurofins Scientific Group, is an international provider of genomic services around the core business lines next generation sequencing, custom DNA sequencing, oligonucleotides, siRNA and gene synthesis. We were offered their DNA-sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis services at favourable conditions.
IKA
The Ika Group is a German provider for premium laboratory and analysis technology who has gained a leading position in the world market with its innovative magnetic stirrers, mixers, overhead stirrers, shakers, homogenizers, mills, rotary evaporators, calorimeters, laboratory reactors and specially developed software for laboratory and analysis applications. For the homogenization of our moss we used their Ultra Turrax T25, courtesy of IKA including the accessories kit.
Qiagen
QIAGEN N.V., a Netherlands holding company, is the leading global provider of Sample & Assay Technologies that are used to transform biological materials into valuable molecular information. QIAGEN markets more than 500 products around the world, selling both consumable kits and automation systems to customers through four classes: Molecular Diagnostics (human healthca Applied Testing (forensics, veterinary testing and food safety), Pharma (pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies) and Academia (life sciences research). QIAGEN supported our efforts in the iGEM competition by providing us with their QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit.
MathWorks
MathWorks is the leading developer of mathematical computing software. Engineers and scientists worldwide rely on its products to accelerate the pace of discovery, innovation, and development. We used MATLAB for our modeling.
IBA
IBA GmbH is dedicated to providing high quality product and service solutions for life science research in industry and academia. The comprehensive portfolio ranges from nucleic acid custom services to products and services for cloning, transfection, recombinant protein production and cell isolation. The company´s brands include StarGate®, MATra (MagTag®), Strep-tag®, Strep-Tactin®, Twin-Strep-tag®, His-tag and Streptamer®
DAAD
The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) is the largest funding organisation in the world supporting the international exchange of students and scholars. Since it was founded in 1925, more than 1.5 million scholars in Germany and abroad have received DAAD funding. It is a registered association and its members are German institutions of higher education and student bodies. Its activities go far beyond simply awarding grants and scholarships. The DAAD supports the internationalisation of German universities, promotes German studies and the German language abroad, assists developing countries in establishing effective universities and advises decision makers on matters of cultural, education and development policy.
IDT
Integrated DNA Technologies sells short strands of DNA called oligonucleotides, which are synthesized by using chemical DNA synthesis machines. This single-stranded DNA, that the researchers order from IDT, allows them to use IDT's custom made oligonucleotides as if they had existed naturally. IDT is the largest manufacturer of custom oligo products in the US today and became the industry leader in this competitive field by maintaining the highest standards of quality, service, and technical know-how.
Thermo Scientific
Thermo Scientific is the world leader in serving science and stands for superior analytical instruments, laboratory equipment, software, services, consumables and reagents. With revenues of $13 billion and approximately 39,000 employees Thermo Scientific serves customers within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, clinical diagnostic labs, universities and research institutions. Their products and services help their customers solve complex analytical challenges, improve patient diagnostics and increase laboratory productivity.
ERASynBio
ERASynBio is an ERA-NET from the seventh framework program for the development and coordination of Synthetic Biology in the European Research Area. The central idea of ERASynBio is to promote the robust development of Synthetic Biology by structuring and coordinating national efforts and investment.
