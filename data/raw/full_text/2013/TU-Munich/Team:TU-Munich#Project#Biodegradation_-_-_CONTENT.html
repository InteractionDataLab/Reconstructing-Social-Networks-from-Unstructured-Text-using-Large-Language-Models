environment&quot;</I> [<A href="http://www.epa.gov/oust/cat/tumgloss.htm" class="external text" rel="nofollow">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2009</A>]. We work with this concept by degrading or transforming noxious substances in waste water into non-hazardous compounds.
These substances, such as antibiotics, hormones or pesticides are not removed by common waste water treatment plants because current methods such as active carbon and ozonization are expensive and energy-intensive. But it is possible to inactivate them with existing enzymes from natural catabolic mechanisms in different microorganisms. To utilize these enzymes, we integrated them into a plant as a self-sustaining, sedentary organism to create a functional water filter system. To illustrate this approach, we chose three potent enzymes:
</P><UL><LI> The <A href="#Erythromycin_Esterase_.28EreB.29"><B>Erythromycin esterase</B></A>, which degrades macrolides, a persistant group of antibiotics

Due to their success, thousands of tons of antibiotics have been produced, consumed and excreted into the environment. Since antibiotics are designed to circulate through the body for a long time, up to 75% of the administered doses leaves the organism unaltered. As a result, microbes are exposed to a <B>strong selective pressure</B> to which these extremely adaptable organisms react by developing <B>resistance mechanisms</B>.  
</P><P>However, antimicrobial effectiveness is a precious, limited resource, that we can no longer do without. Accordingly, in 2000 a <A href="http://www.who.int/infectious-disease-report/2000/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">World Health Organization report</A> focused on antibiotic resistance as one of the <B>most critical human health challenges</B> of the next century and called for “a global strategy to contain resistance”. The WHO estimates that resistant pathogens affect 2 million Americans each year, of which 14,000 die as a result. In the EU, antimicrobial resistance is responsible for 25,000 deaths every year and the annual treatment and social costs have been estimated at some €1.5 billion [<A href="http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/0909_TER_The_Bacterial_Challenge_Time_to_React.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ECDC/EMEA joint technical report 2009</A>]. These numbers will rise if nothing is done to prevent precious antibiotics from loosing their effect on microbes.

</P><P>Furthermore research on <B>new antibiotics</B> needs to be hugely intensified to create alternative agents and keep pace with the formation of antimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, antibiotic development has slowed dramatically over the past 25 years, since as a short-course and highly effective therapy, they have a much lower rate of return on investment  than other drugs and are therefore financially not very viable for pharmaceutical companies. The development costs per approved agent are estimated to be between $400-$800 million. In 2004, only 5 new antibacterial agents were under development by the largest pharmaceutical companies, barely beating the 4 new molecular entities to treat erectile dysfunction. [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937522/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Davies and Davies, 2010</A>]
</P><P>These two options are difficult to accomplish due to the <B>increasing need of antibiotics</B> with a growing world-wide population and the fact that finding new antibiotics is a costly, long-term and extremely difficult project. Therefore we focus on a third option to fight the spread of antibiotic resistance: The development of a cost-effective water-filter that will prevent continuous inflow of the drugs into surface water and thus reduce the selective pressure on microbes.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Our_Solution:_EreB">Our Solution: EreB</SPAN></H3><P>In our search for a suitable enzyme we looked at antibiotic concentrations in waste water. There have not yet been many investigations on this topic, but one of the main surveys was executed by the <A href="http://www.blac.de/servlet/is/2146/P-2c.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">German national committee for chemical safety (BLAC)</A> of 202 effluent samples from 34 waste water treatment plants (WWTP). The result was that the main detectable antibiotics are the macrolides Erythromycin, Roxythromycin and Clarithromycin, the Sulfonamide Sulfamethoxalol as well as the Fluoroquinolone Ciprofloxacin. Most concentrations are about 100 ng/l, but maximum concentrations reached more than 3 µg/l. The often prescribed ß-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, were not detectable probably due to their fast degradation. Another important conclusion of the study is, that the main source of antibiotic input into the aquatic environment is municipal waste water. Similar results were found in other countries (see Table 1).

The MIC50 depends on the species.

Macrolides are important and clinically relevant agents used to treat infectious diseases, first introduced into clinics in 1952 as an alternative to penicillin. Today they are mainly applied for treatment of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, the leading cause of childhood deaths worldwide. The drug functions by inhibiting protein biosynthesis when it binds to the exit tunnel of the 50S ribosomal subunit which leads to abortion of the growth of nascent peptide chains.
Macrolides can be enzymatically inactivated with the macrolide esterases EreA and EreB, from which we chose EreB as our model enzyme since it has a broader degradation spectrum than EreA and is not metal-dependent.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Current_Solutions_2"> Current Solutions </SPAN></H3><P>Today catechol can be treated by a variety of methods including treatment by bioregenerated anaerobic granular activated carbon (GAC), anaerobic biological treatment using upflow anaerobic fixed-film fixed-bed reactors as well as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, with the latter being the most promising one. 
Despite their decent efficiency, these methods lack the applicability where they are most needed: Rural areas in third world countries are the most affected by the pollution of the surrounding oil and gas industries. The aforementioned technologies all need skilled technicians, a constant supply of water and electricity and of course money to maintain them. All those factors got us to look deeper into a simpler and more cost-effective way to address those problems: Phytoremediation.

Laccases belong to the <A href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">enzyme class of Oxidoreductases (EC 1.10.3.2)</A>. They are also known as monophenolic Oxidases, because of their substrate specifity. It is widely believed that laccases are the simpliest representatives of the ubiquitous blue multi-copper oxidase family. Laccases are extracellular enzymes consiststing usually of 15-20 % carbon-hydrogen. Their molecular weight ranges deglycated from 60 to 80 kDa. Further on, laccases can occur as monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers.

In general, laccases catalyze the linked oxidation of many aromatic and phenolic substances while the phenolic group is oxidized to a radical and oxygen is reduced to a hydrate.
The active site of the enzyme includes a four-copper-ion-cluster which can be detected by using spectroscopy. The cluster consists of one type 1 blue copper-ion, one type 2 and two type 3 copper-ions. In this reaction the electron from the oxidation is transfered to the other three copper ions. These ions form a trinuclearic cluster, which transfers electrons to the terminal electron acceptor oxygen. In the end, molecular oxygen is reduced, by receiving four electrons, to water.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Possible_applications_of_Laccases">Possible applications of Laccases</SPAN></H4><P>Due to their ability to oxidize phenolic and nonphenolic lignin related compounds, as well as highly recalcitrant environmental pollutants, laccases possess a high potential as a bioremediation agent in synthetic biology. Waste water from hospitals, textile and paper industry, as well as in sewage treatment plants can be detoxified. Possible substrates may be natural and synthetic estrogens, xenoestrogens and polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons. Laccases may also be used to degrade high polymeric lignin to make use of the polymer for energy generation. Carcinogenic, mutagenic aromatic hydrocarbons and estrogens, xenoestrogens and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be oxidized and detoxified by laccases, too. In addition to that, laccases can oxidize up herbicides, pesticides in soil.

The laccase, which was prepared and sent to the Parts Registry by the team of Bielefeld was fused to a histag and a ribosome binding site. The molecular weight of this Laccase is 58.6 kDa. Comparing the enzyme activity between 25°C and 10°C, you can see that it is influenced marginal, but it slightly decreases. Its pH optimum is reached at pH 4 to 5. The differences in activity varying the concentration of CuCl2, differ minimal. An optimum is reached at 0.6 mM. An increase of the concentration of CuCl2 decreases the enzyme activity of the laccase. The lower the used concentration of MeOH and acetonitrile was, the higher the enzyme activity was detected. Bielefeld established many different Laccases in iGEM 2012, but we chose this one, because it seemed to be the most effective one, they have characterized.
