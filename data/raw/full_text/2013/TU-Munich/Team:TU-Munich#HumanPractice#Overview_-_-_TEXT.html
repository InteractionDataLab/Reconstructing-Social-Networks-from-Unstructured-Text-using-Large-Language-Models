Human Practice Overview
We know about the great importance of communication in science and the big role it plays in the fate of new technologies. Therefore we set out to collect lots of valuable feedback, to share our ideas and to inspire new perspectives. On this page you can read about our efforts to interact with experts and get in touch with the public. We learned a lot from the experts and they encouraged us to further improve our project. We also hope that we arouse the public interest in synthetic biology as its importance is likely to rise over the next years.

Tutorials
We would like to share the experiences we made and pass on the solutions and skills we generated this summer with the iGEM community, so we created a couple of useful tutorials for the following iGEM generations.
