The team-forming was initiated by three students and two instructors who already participated in <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Munich" class="external text" rel="nofollow">last year´s iGEM team</A> and who were looking for enthusiastic fellow campaigners to participate in iGEM 2013. The result was a team, consisting of 10 students and 3 instructors, willing to participate in a great contribution to the competition. To bridge the gap between old and new team members, we visited several folk festivals (luckily we're quite blessed with them in the greater Munich area) and had dinners together. The result was a dynamic group with fruitful relationships between the group members. Thus we have a very enjoyable working atmosphere and hopefully an equally successful participation in the iGEM competition.
</P><P>We are very lucky and deeply grateful having the chance to work in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, who holds the <A href="http://biologische-chemie.userweb.mwn.de/index.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chair of Biological Chemistry</A> at the Technical University of Munich. The team had full access to all laboratory equipment that was needed to realize our PhyscoFilter project. Without the help and support of Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra and his Team the project in its present form would not have been possible.

</P><P>What kind of character do you need to get a “master” grade in the 4th bachelor's semester? Due to his amount of perfect processed Quikchanges, with his diligence and inexorable endurance, Andi really deserved his codename as “Master of Quickchange”. For advancing our project in different fields, including establishing and maintaining the contact between different iGEM Teams, Andi is one of our connecting persons who travelled for example through four cities within 3 days. Next to this, Andi is a very cooperative, high flying and humorous character. In the end of our project his power was mainly invested in the preparation, execution and planning of the Educational-Kits and performing the experiment to prove the existence of cut-off membrane constructs.

His enthusiasm for the project goes so far, that he can sleep 3 hours per night – one week straight, when there is urgent work to be done. After getting in touch with the idea of iGEM, Jeffery was immediately infected by the idea of synthetic biology. He has a keen interest in optogenetics and signaling, which made him the perfect fit to work on our safety mechanism. Besides to his enormous wisdom, he is one of the most uncomplicated and down-to-earth people we ever got acquainted with.

</P><P>At first glance Ingmar seems to be wrong in the laboratory, because you can easily mix him up with a manager of a joint-stock company, but at second glance you recognize him being the “Usain Bolt” of the laboratory. There is nothing which can not be managed and organized by him until time is used optimally, even if he is forced to run between the photo laboratory (first floor) checking a result of a gel electrophoresis and heat-shocking bacteria of a transformation (ground floor) in parallel. Ingmar is always motivated, helping in every situation as good as he can and managed to finish his bachelors thesis in Bioprocess Engineering besides iGEM. Last but definitely not least, we have to mention a hobby of Ingmar, which is called: “Destroy Falcon Tubes in an ultra-centrifuge at 47000 xg during a midi-prep and still try to extract the plasmid-pellet!”

If you got the chance to admire our team poster at the „Biotechnology 2020+ Conference of the Ministry of Research and Education“ in Berlin, you were admiring the work of Katrin.
