Results Overview
Having spent our summer in the lab, we are proud to present our accomplishments. Up to the European regional jamboree in Lyon, we have created 72 BioBricks and devices, transformed and selected 20 different transgenic GM-mosses and characterized our effectors as recombinant proteins produced in E. coli and in our moss Physcomitrella patens, a chassis newly introduced into iGEM. We took further steps to put our phytoremediation project into practice by developing concepts for the implementation of our PhyscoFilter in the environment and by analyzing the economic potential of this innovative technology in our Entrepreneurship section. Additional to our wetlab work, we contributed a very powerful software tool for the annotation of BioBricks from the Parts Registry and created tutorials to pass this summer´s experiences and skills on to the subsequent iGEM generations.

BioBricks
We created 72 BioBricks, including BioBricks advancing the use of Physcomitrella patens as a chassis, BioBricks enhancing phytoremediation applications and BioBricks for the light triggered kill-switch mechanism.

Effector studies
We selected six different effector proteins, produced them in Escherichia coli and characterized them, concerning stability and activity.

Moss Methods
We performed some general experi- ments to optimize Physcomitrella patens concerning tolerance of toxins, growth optimization and the use of different cultivation surfaces. Furthermore, we created 20 different strains of transformed moss during our visit to Prof. Reski's lab in Freiburg. Read more
Localization
In order to ensure the best functionality for our effectors, we designed and used several localization methods as well as different verification techniques to see if our localizations were successful.

PhyscoFilter
After the selection and regeneration of the transgenic moss plants, we performed experiments with them and characterized their properties as PhyscoFilter.

Kill Switch
In order to prevent uncontrolled growth of transgenic moss in the environment, we developed a Kill-Switch which is triggered by sunlight. The GM-Moss can only be grown where red-light is filtered out of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Implementation
The creation of new environmental solutions doesn't stop at the development of GM moss. We tried to find out how a large-scale biofilter could be implemented.

AutoAnnotator
Protein coding BioBricks constitute large parts of the Parts Registry. We created a software tool for in-silico characterization of various para- meters summed up in a standardized table. To improve the parts registry, RFC 96 proposes a range of characteristics determined by the AutoAnnotator. Read more
Entrepreneurship
To translate science into applied technology, available to the public, economic and business factors play increasingly important roles. We took the first steps into this direction by examining criteria for implementation and possibilities of business models in biotechnology.
