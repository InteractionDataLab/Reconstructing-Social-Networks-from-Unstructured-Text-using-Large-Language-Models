</P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 1</B>: The three main parts of our safety system</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Biosafety to us means minimizing the risks concering the team working in the lab, the general public and the environment. <I>Physcomitrella</I> itself does not pose any risks to the health of the researcher or the general public, since it is endemic to many parts of the world. In the lab, we are able to cultivate our moss in bioreactors in which the flow of substances is tightly controlled.  They can even be used for the production of therapeutic proteins, as done by the <A href="http://www.greenovation.com/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">greenovation</A> company. For usage in a sewage plant, such reactors could be upscaled and special filter systems could be applied to ensure that no moss can escape into the environment. However, our long-term goal is to use moss filters <B>in</B> polluted environments but at the same time ensuring the highest level of biological safety. 
</P><P>We believe that the main biosafety-issues that have to be addressed regarding our project are
</P><UL><LI> toxicity of recombinant proteins
</LI><LI> toxicity of degradation products
</LI><LI> transgene pollution (vertical and horizontal gene transfer)
</LI></UL><P>In order to minimize the aforementioned risks, we have taken several  measures, including a light-triggered killswitch, non-sporulating <I>Physcomitrella</I> strains and the evaluation of the genetic parts that we are using in terms of safety.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity_of_recombinant_proteins">Toxicity of recombinant proteins</SPAN></H3><P>The most obvious safety threat is that the recombinant proteins might be toxic and thus have a negative effect on the environment. This is the foundation of our safety consideration - that the products from all parts and genetic circuits must not cause harm by themselves. All our effector proteins (laccase, catechol-2,3-dioxygenase, erythromycin esterase B) are all from S1 organisms and are not toxic. For example, laccases are already used in the food industry [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2963825/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Osma et al., 2010</A>]. For the establishment of a eukaryotic expression system, we are also using parts of mammalian origin and from S2-organisms (see safety forms below). We have made the decisions to use parts from S2 organism carefully and only after consulting our safety officer. He could ensure us that the parts and circuits we are using do not pose any threat. When possible, we have tried to substitute parts from S2 organisms with parts from S1 organisms. All of the parts we are using (such as a polioviral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the Ig-Kappa secretion signal from mouse) are widely used in molecular biology laboratories all around the world and are considered safe.

</TD></TR><TR><TH>Why do you need to use this organism/part? Is there an organism/part from a less dangerous Risk Group that would accomplish the same purpose?
</TH><TD>Without IRES we would have to put a promotor in front of every protein we want to express which would make cloning of large constructs much more difficult.

</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Toxicity_of_degradation_products">Toxicity of degradation products</SPAN></H3><P>None of the transgenic plants that we have created is able to produce a toxic substance. However, degradation products of hormones, antibiotics and other pollutants could be potentially toxic. Therefore, the reaction products will be monitored using LC/MS analysis.
For example for EreB, the transformation products of erythromycin possess no endocrine and mutagenic properties [<A href="http://www.endetech.eu/sites/default/files/field/image/2013.06.07-Oral%20presentation%20ICWRER%202013.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">endetech</A>]. In general, it is very difficult to find data on the toxicity of these degradation products.  
</P><P>Additionally, the substances used in bioaccumulation (Glutathion-S-transferase, Proteinphosphatase 1) are not harmful themselves, but moss that has bound toxic substances (e.g. microcystin) in high concentrations is potentially toxic and has to be disposed of separately and with caution.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transgene_pollution">Transgene pollution</SPAN></H3><P><B>Transgene pollution</B> describes the spread of transgenes beyond the genetically modified species by natural gene flow mechanisms [<A href="http://www.cabi.org/cabreviews/FullTextPDF/2003/20033177371.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Commandeur et al., 2003</A>]. Transgenes can spread from transgenic to non-transgenic populations of the same species or related wild species (<B>vertical gene transfer</B>) or to entirely different species such as bacteria (<B>horizontal gene transfer</B>). Because the impact of novel genes on other species is unpredictable, transgene pollution is undesirable and could pose a risk to the ecosystem. When talking about transgenes, one also has to differentiate between <B>primary transgenes</B> such as our effectors and <B>superfluous DNA sequences</B> such as antibiotic resistance markers. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Preventing_vertical_gene_transfer_with_non-sporulating_Physcomitrella_strains">Preventing vertical gene transfer with non-sporulating <I>Physcomitrella</I> strains  </SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 2</B>: Sporophytes of P. patens WT (A) and DSiR1 (BâD) lines 8 weeks after induction of sporulation. The spores of WT plants develop until they are mature in the spore capsules which then tear open and set free the spores. In the DSiR1 lines the spore capsules crack  open when the spores inside are still immature, Wiedemann et al., 2010</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In order to prevent vertical gene transfer and to limit the spread of the moss in the environment, we looked for strains which are not able to form mature spores. <I>P. patens</I> is monoicous, meaning that male and female organs are produced in one plant. Normally, at the tips of adult gametophores the sexual organs, antheridia (male) and archegonia (female), are produced under inducing conditions. After fertilisation of the egg inside the archegonium a sporophyte develops which contains approx. 5000 spores. A possible way to inhibit successful germination of these spores is to knock out the enzyme sulfite reductase 1 (SiR1). This protein reduces sulfite to sulfide and is involved in sulfur metabolism. [<A href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579310002462" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Wiedemann et al., 2010</A>] disrupted PpSiR1 by homologous recombination and found that ÎSiR1 plants showed strong developmental alterations and are unable to produce mature spores. In the ÎSiR1 lines, only one third of the number of sporophytes was formed, the spore capsules cracked open when the spores inside were still immature and these mutant spores did not germinate. Since it takes more time to establish a mature culture with the knock-out mutants and considering the limited time in iGEM competitions, we did not actually use this mutant in our experiments for iGEM. However, the mutant can easily be ordered from the <A href="http://www.moss-stock-center.org/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow">International Moss Stock Center</A>. A consideration for the future would be to design the integration vector in a way that targeted gene knockouts in the disulfite reductase gene are possible, thus inhibiting sporulation and having a targeted integration of constructs.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Horizontal_gene_transfer">Horizontal gene transfer</SPAN></H4><P>Concerning horizontal gene transfer, the main safety threat would be the spread of transgenes from our moss to bacteria. The transfer of primary transgenes or marker genes could lead to new bacteria strains that express these genes and could pass them on to pathogenic strains. But while this process is very common in bacteria, apart from <I>agrobacterium tumefaciens</I>, there are few examples of natural gene transfer between bacteria and higher eukaryotes [<A href="http://www.cabi.org/cabreviews/FullTextPDF/2003/20033177371.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Commandeur et al., 2003</A>]. 
</P><P>For the transgene to remain in the bacterial population and thus in the environment, there has to be a strong selective pressure. This could be the case in highly contaminated environments, where the ability to break down a toxic pollutant is beneficial. We are aware that our moss carries transgenes that could be advantageous to bacteria living in these polluted environments. But since <B>all</B> of the effectors that we are testing actually come from bacteria, we do no think that this is the main problem. The genes for these effectors are already present in the bacteria population. Nevertheless, we need to have a closer look at antibiotic resistance genes such as ereB and the selection marker nptII. Antibiotic resistance genes are the focus of attention because of their potentially strong and general selective advantage in human pathogens. But in the case of ereB, which comes from <I>E.coli</I>, the resistance gene is already present in the bacterial population on plasmids while in the moss it is controlled by a moss promotor and integrated in the moss genome. Therefore, it is much more likely that in case of ereB, the horizontal gene transfer occurs between bacteria and not between bacteria and moss. 
</P><P>A possible way to eliminate superfluous DNA sequences such as the nptII marker after a successful transformation is the use of a two-component site-specific recombination system such as Cre-loxP [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1660141" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Dale and Ow, 1991</A>]. The recombinase Cre recognizes short sequences known (loxP) and is then able to excise DNA betweeen two loxP sites that are in the same orientation. Therefore, marker genes flanked by loxP sites can be efficiently excised from transgenic plants if Cre is present.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Light-triggered_Killswitch">Light-triggered Killswitch</SPAN></H4><P>In order to prevent our moss from escaping into the environment, we have included a light-triggered killswitch. When exposed to red-light, a nuclease system is activated which destroys all genetic material, killing the moss and preventing the spread of genetic material of the moss. With this genetic circuit it would be possible to create an niche for the transgenic moss by just covering an area with a blue  filter foil. For more information, look at the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Project/Killswitch" class="external text" rel="nofollow">killswitch page</A>.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biosecurity">Biosecurity</SPAN></H2><P>Biosecurity is the prevention of loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins. <I>Physcomitrella</I> itself is in no way pathogenic and is endemic to many parts of the world. However, just like with every transgenic organism, there is the theoretical possibility to use <I>Physcomitrella</I> to cause harm, e.g. when it is used to secrete toxic substances. Nevertheless, other organisms which have for example shorter generation times or are pathogenic by nature seem to be more appropriate for such dual-use applications. Additionally, none of the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Results/GM-Moss#Transgenic_Physcomitrella_patnes_plants|" class="external text" rel="nofollow">transgenic plants we created</A> could be used to cause harm.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Labsafety">Labsafety</SPAN></H2><P>The lab we work in is classified as BSL 1 (biosafety level 1), according to the <A href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0054:en:NOT|European" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Union Directive 2000/54/EG</A> and the German &quot;Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik (<A href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gentg/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GenTG</A>)&quot; (law for the regulation of genetic engineering). There is a total of four Biosafety levels, with BSL 1 being the lowest and BSL 4 being the highest.

Work inside a BSL 1 lab, such as ours, involves no devices that are potentially harmful to the researchers if they act according to the general precautionary measures.

</P><P>A regular safety briefing and a lecture about the legal basics concerning biotechnology and genetic engineering are basic elements of our education at TU Munich. In this context, the handling of biological material, dangerous aspects of chemicals and the circumstances and protocols at the lab we work in are explained.

</P><OL><LI>In every laboratory of molecular biology, specific chemicals are required for the staining of DNA, in order to make it visible on agarose gels. Most of them directly intercalate into double-stranded DNA, making them carcinogenic. The substance we use is ethidium bromide. To prevent skin contact, we wear protective gloves made from nitrile rubber and change them frequently to prevent contamination. All gels and materials that come into contact with ethidium bromide are disposed of separately. This is done in order to prevent their unintended leakage into the environment with subsequent harm to humans, animals and plants. 
</LI><LI>Methods of molecular biology often require strong acids or bases, like hydrochloric acid, or toxic substances such as methanol. We handle them with extreme caution under a fume hood and dispose of them separately.
</LI><LI>Many devices in the lab can be potentially dangerous towards researchers if they are used carelessly or in the wrong way. One example for this are lamps emitting ultraviolet radiation, which can cause damage to the eyes. When dealing with UV radiation, we always wear safety helmets made out of plexiglas. We are aware of the potential harm caused by devices that we are using and thus can protect ourselves appropriately.
