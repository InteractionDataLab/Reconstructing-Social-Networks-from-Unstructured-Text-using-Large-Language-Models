Modeling Overview
In our modeling efforts, we tried to cover a very wide range of different methods, reaching from simple and ordinary differential equations, over partial differential equations, to stochastic differential equations as well as bioinformatical methods. To gain the largest possible output, we stayed in close contact with our wetlab team, answered their design questions and fitted parameters which could then be used for implementation aspects.

Protein Predictions
For the immobilization of effectors on the cell membrane, we needed to design a transmembrane domain. Using several bioinformatical methods we identified the transmembrane region of the SERK receptor which we later used as starting point for our constructs. Read More
Enzyme Kinetics
For an effective implementation of our filter system it is essential to analyze the enzymatic activity of our effectors. Using experimental data we fitted the respective kinetic parameters and carried out rigorous uncertainty analysis to assess the reliability of the fitted parameters. Read More
Kill Switch
During the planning stage of our project, we had several different ideas on how to efficiently implement a kill-switch in our moss. In this section of the wiki we documented our mathematical train of thought that eventually led us to our final design.

Filter Model
The filter model is designed to simulate different remediation scenarios. It should be used to calculate the necessary amount of PhyscoFilters, referring to the environmental parameters.
