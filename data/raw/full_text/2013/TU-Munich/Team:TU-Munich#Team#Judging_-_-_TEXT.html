Bronze Criteria
Team registration:
We successfully registered our team and paid the registration fee.
Complete Judging form:
We successfully entered all the required Information into the Judging Form.
Team Wiki:
As you can see right now, we successfully created a team wiki and documented all our work according to the Wiki Requirements .
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree:
We are eagerly awaiting the Jamboree in Lyon to present our Project Idea and our Results.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick's Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry:
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Silver Criteria
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected:
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry:
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines):
See <partinfo>BBa_K1159000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K1159001</partinfo> as well as a series of other parts.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project:
See https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Project/Safety
Gold Criteria
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
We improved three previously existing parts:
Laccase: <partinfo>BBa_K863000</partinfo> to <partinfo>BBa_K1159002</partinfo>
We converted the part from RFC 10 to RFC 25.
FluA: <partinfo>BBa_K157004</partinfo> to <partinfo>BBa_K1159003</partinfo>
We submitted an engineered variant with three additional mutations which make it 75-times more affine to fluorescein (KD from 152 nM to 2 nM).
PP1: BBa_K1012001 to Part:BBa_K1159004
We converted the part from RFC 10 to RFC 25.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We had close collaboration with the 2013 teams from Dundee and Paris-Saclay and exchanged Biobricks with the 2012 team from LMU Munich and the 2013 teams from Tübingen, Uppsala and Paris Saclay.  See: https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Team/Collaborations
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
We took a new approach to the problem of phytoremediation by introducing a new chassis to iGEM. We hope that this will serve as reference for future teams who work on bioremediation or related environmental problems. See Phytoremediation for more details.
We wrote three tutorials in order to help previous iGEM teams to program better wiki pages, create animated gifs from PDB protein structures and to use Arduino microcontrollers in their iGEM project.
We submitted RFC[96 ] to the BioBrick Foundation which describes the usage of the AutoAnnotator to increase the quality of part descriptions for protein coding BioBricks. This software translates the nucleotide sequence into amino acids, calculates several parameters and performs alignments against various data bases and finally provides all collected data in a standardized table which can easily be pasted into a part description.
