The team could build on the knowledge of Jeffery Truong, Ingmar Polte and Katrin Fischer who had already participated in last year's competition and already knew the most important techniques and the laboratory. They implemented the lab management from last year from the first moment on, such as our extensive <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Notebook/Labjournal" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Labjournal</A>.  For the first usage of instruments we obtained an introduction into the lab techniques by an instructor. Measurement itself and the evaluation of the obtained data were done by us.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="LC-MS_Measurements">LC-MS Measurements</SPAN></H4><P>The LC-MS measurements were performed to confirm the successful degradation of pollutants by effector proteins which were produced recombinantly or which were expressed by transgenic moss plants. Here we contacted Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann, who already helped us in our last year's iGEM project with the detection of caffeine and xanthohumole. The responsible team member for the LC-MS was in both years Ingmar Polte who performed the degradation experiments, established the contact to Prof. Hofmann and brought the samples to the <A href="http://www.molekulare-sensorik.de" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chair for Molecular Sensory</A>. At the chair, the student members Ingmar Polte or Andreas-David Brunner contacted the operator of the mass spectrometer (Mr. Friederich or Dr. Stark) with whose they did the sample preparation, the actual measurements and the data evaluation.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="ESI-TOF_Measurements">ESI-TOF Measurements</SPAN></H4><P>In order to confirm the correctness of recombinant proteins they were analyzed in the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer, which is present at our hosting laboratory. For this purpose a student team member did the sample preparation, calculated the theoretical mass using the <B><A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Results/Software" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AutoAnnotator</A></B> and brought the samples to Andreas Reichert who is a doctoral student at the chair and is responsible for the ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. He measured the samples together with a student team member and showed us the deconvolution of the primary data.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Fluorescense_Microscopy">Fluorescense Microscopy</SPAN></H4><P>All fluorescense microscopy experiments were performed at the <A href="http://plantdev.bio.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=36" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chair for Plant Developmental Biology</A> (Prof. Dr. Schneitz) as plants (and especially <I>P. patens</I>) exhibit a strong autofluorescence caused by the photosystem. Therefore an advanced microscope with appropriate filters is absolutely necessary which we could use at the Chair for Plant Developmental Biology. The experiments were performed by our student member <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Team/Members" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong</A> who has worked during his bachelor thesis with fluorescense microscopy over several weeks and was therefore an essential experimentator for this part of the project. An introduction to the microscopes was given by Dr. Prasad Vaddepalli.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transformation_of_Physcomitrella_patens">Transformation of <I>Physcomitrella patens</I></SPAN></H4><P>The transformation of <I>Physcomitrella patens</I> was one of the main concerns when we thought about working with <I>Physcomitrella</I> as it might cause some trouble which can only be handled by using the appropriate equipment and the advises of an experienced researcher. Therefore we contacted <B>Prof. Dr. Reski</B> (Freiburg University, 350 km distance) in May and could win him as an advisor for our team. After traveling several times to Freiburg we could perform the <B>transformations</B> in his lab. For this purpose we brought all buffers and the sterile linearized DNA from Munich and performed the transformation under the instructions of Dr. Gertrud Wiedemann. All steps of the transformation were conducted by student team members as it can be seen in our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Results/Moss#3._Transformation_of_Physcomitrella_patens" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Transformation Results</A> section.

The group photos of our team were created by the press office of the TUM.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Laboratory_of_Prof._Dr._Skerra"> Laboratory of Prof. Dr. Skerra </SPAN></H2><P>The research group at the <A href="http://biologische-chemie.userweb.mwn.de/index.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chair of Biological Chemistry</A> at TUM works in the field of biochemical protein engineering and design with a focus on therapeutic proteins and their application. The three main fields of research are (1) the development of <B>anticalins</B> which is an alternative binding scaffold and which are a promising alternative for conventional antibodies (2) the <B>extension</B> of the <B>plasma half-life</B> of therapeutic proteins using a poly-peptide polymer and (3) the <B>site-specific conjugation</B> of therapeutic proteins. Thus the focus of our hosting laboratory is biomedical engineering whereas our iGEM topic shows no intersection with this topic. 
The single negligible exception is that we used a <B>higher engineered anticalin</B> (&lt;partinfo&gt;K1159003&lt;/partinfo&gt;) to bind fluorescein in our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:TU-Munich/Project/Bioaccumulation" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BioAccumulation</A> subproject, compared to the conventional BioBrick (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K157004&lt;/partinfo&gt;). This higher engineered version has three additional amino acid exchanges and exhibits a 75-fold higher affinity for its binding partner (fluorescein). It was not essential to have this higher engineered version for our project but we wanted to supply the registry with this improved part.
Beside this plasmid, we also obtained a plasmid for the TEV protease from the chair which we have used to generate the Split-TEV protease (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1159100" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K1159100</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1159101" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K1159101</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1159102" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K1159102</A>).
