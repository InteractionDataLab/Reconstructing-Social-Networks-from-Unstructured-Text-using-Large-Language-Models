Potential Impact
As microbial consortia are able to perform more complex tasks than monocultures and are more robust to environmental changes [1] the impact of our project – the engineering of a stable synthetic microbial consortium – has to be considered strong for many fields in biotechnology. For instance, current literature discusses the impact of complex bacterial systems on overall production and composition of biofuels [2], which is a rapidly growing field of interest due to increasing consumption of limited terrestrial oil resources. Aside from biofuel production, microbial consortia are already used in wastewater treatment [1]. Eiteman et al. demonstrated that lignocellulosic biomass is more efficiently fermented in a consortium of two different E. coli strains than in monocultures [3].  However, no mechanism to efficiently control these complex systems has been established yet. We address this issue in our project.
With our system we contribute to the establishment of a universal and widely applicable system for bacterial co-cultivation in order to expand the potential of synthetic biology to more complex tasks.
Single steps of biotechological processes can be split between
individual strains in microbial consortia. (modified from [1])
