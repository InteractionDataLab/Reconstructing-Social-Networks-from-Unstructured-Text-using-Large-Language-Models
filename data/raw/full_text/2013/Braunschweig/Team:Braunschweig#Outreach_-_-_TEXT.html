We developed a PR-guide based on scientific communication strategies

We asked ourselves: How can we, as natural scientists, tell the public about the great ideas we have? Activities like the ones listed above, definitely help people to come in touch with synthetic biology. But how can we measure the success of those activities and multiply their outreach? The solution: We developed a guide “How to succeed in public relations” for all future iGEM teams. The guide consists of different parts:
Communication Strategy
Implementing the Communication Strategy
Social Media Analysis
To measure the success of all Human Practices activities we created as well a Media Coverage Report where all publications related to our project and our team are listed and analysed.
