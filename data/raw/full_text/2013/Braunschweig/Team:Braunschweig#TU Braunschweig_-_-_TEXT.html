Founded in 1745, the Technische Universität Braunschweig is the oldest institute of technology in Germany. Following this tradition, the university was one of the first to recognize the importance of interdisciplinary education. Innovative fields of study such as Germany’s first biotechnology program were established here. Today, the Technische Universität Braunschweig is part of the TU9, an alliance of Germany’s finest and biggest institutes of technology. Besides the renowned engineering faculty, the university also includes a well-established life science faculty with an unique network to major research institutions in Braunschweig. The Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research is only one of them. This network opens an inimitable variety of perspectives to researchers and students.
