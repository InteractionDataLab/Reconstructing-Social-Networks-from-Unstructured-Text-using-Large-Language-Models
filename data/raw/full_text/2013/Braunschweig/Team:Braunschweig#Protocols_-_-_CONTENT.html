Depending on the mode of growth (regulated or unregulated) the medium was supplemented with ampicillin or chloramphenicol, respectively. Samples were taken every hour to monitor the cell density. To determine the ratios of the two strains in the culture, samples were spread out on agar plates, incubated at 37 °C and obtained colored colonies were counted.
