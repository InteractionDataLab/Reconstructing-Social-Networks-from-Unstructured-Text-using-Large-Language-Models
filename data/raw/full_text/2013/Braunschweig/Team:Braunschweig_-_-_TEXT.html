Our project
In our project we engineered a synthetic microbial consortium exploiting three different Quorum Sensing systems.
Results
We engineered two complementing constructs that show regulatory behavior in mixed cultures.
Human Practices
How to reach the public? We developed a guide "How to succeed in Public Relations" for all future iGEM Teams.

Impact
With our engineered microbial consortium we contribute to the establishment of a universal and widely applicable system.
Engineering Principles
Our devices were assembled in a modular manner out of individual operation units. The design with distinct operation units guarantees high flexibility during assembly of the final construct.
