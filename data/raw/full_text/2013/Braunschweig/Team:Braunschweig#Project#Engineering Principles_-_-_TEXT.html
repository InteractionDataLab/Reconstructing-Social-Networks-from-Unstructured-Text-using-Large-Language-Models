Engineering Principles
All devices were assembled using standard Biobricks from the registry. Assembly was performed by standard cloning procedures applying the RFC10 standard. The final devices were assembled in a modular manner out of individual operation units. Each operation unit fulfills a specific task within the whole construct. The operation units were ordered on DNA level in a logical way where the use of constitutive and inducible promoters was considered, i.e. the operation unit with an inducible promoter was placed upstream of the operation units controlled by constitutive promoters to avoid any undesirable transcription.
The design with distinct operation units guarantees high flexibility during assembly of the final construct. By applying this engineering principle we were able to easily switch from a triangular microbial consortium to a bidirectional microbial consortium.
