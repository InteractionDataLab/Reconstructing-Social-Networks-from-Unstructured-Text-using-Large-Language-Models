Introduction
Genbrick in action
Linker designer
Appendix
Genbrick Assembly
Design and Preparation - Linker and Segment
1. Overview
Utilise the linker designer software from the EdiGEM 2013 wiki to design Eye and Hook linker oligo pairs
Linker and Segment oligos can be custom-made as single-stranded, unphosphorylated DNA
Forward and reverse oligo pairs are mixed and phosphorylated prior to annealing
2. Preparation
Re-suspend oligo in nuclease-free water to 100 µM (as per instructions)
Phosphorylation reaction (not required if oligos with 5' phosphate are ordered)
Annealing is achieved by addition of 5 µL 5 M NaCl (50 mM [final]) prior to heat denaturation at < 95°C and slow cooling to Room temperature.
Pre-assembly
1. Eye-Part-Hook Preparation
a) Using 3-part pathway as an example:
Acceptor Vector cassette (+promoter); Acc_RFP
LacZ truncated gene (+PLac);PLac_LacZ
Green fluorescent protein; GFP
b) Digestion-Ligation reaction of Eye-Part-Hook (E-P-H) (Overnight)
Acc_RFP-E + Acc_RFP-P + GFP-H
PLac_LacZ-E + PLac_LacZ-P + Acc_RFP-H
GFP-E + GFP-P + PLac_LacZ-H
b) c) Purification of Digestion-Ligation E-P-H product to remove non-ligated DNA/plasmid
Run 50 µL E-P-H Digestion-Ligation reaction on 1% agarose gel
Or: QIAquick PCR Purification kit can be used if Part plasmid does not carry resistance/marker
Assembly
1. Incubation
Use 5 µL each E-P-H required for assembly
Add x µl 10X NEBuffer 4 to make 1X final concentration
Incubate 30-60 minutes at Room Temperature
3-part Example:
5 µL Acc_RFP E-P-H ([Acc_RFP -E]+[ Acc_RFP -P]+[GFP-H])
5 µL PLac_LacZ E-P-H ([PLac_LacZ-E]+[PLac_LacZ-P]+[Acc_RFP-H)
5 µL GFP E-P-H ([GFP-E]+[GFP-P]+[PLac_LacZ-H])
2 µl NEBuffer 4
3 µL sterile water
If larger number of E-P-H in assembly, adjust 10X NEBuffer 4 and water accordingly
2. Transformation
Use 10 µL assembly mix to transform 50 µL NEB 10-beta competent cells C3019H
Culture above assembly example on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol and IPTG
Incubate overnight at 37°C (further growth at RT if colonies require)
