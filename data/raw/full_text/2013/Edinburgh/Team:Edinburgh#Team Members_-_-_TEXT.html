Official team profile
The Edinburgh iGEM 2013 team consists of 9 student members (6 biologists, an engineer, an informatician and an artist), 6 instructors and 4 advisors. We would like to thank our supervisors, who had immense impact on all aspects of our project and the advisors who had to withstand our questions in the lab. Working together was a fabulous experience, which we all greatly enjoyed.
