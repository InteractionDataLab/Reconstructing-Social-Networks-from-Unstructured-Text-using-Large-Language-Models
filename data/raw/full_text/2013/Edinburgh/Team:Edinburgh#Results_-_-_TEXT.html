Results summary
We tested the growth of our experimental strain, Bacillus subtilis 168, under various conditions relevant to the work we are going to perform.
We tested the Kanamycin resistance conferred by pTG262 in B.subtilis and E.coli.
We created an assembly to demonstrate that Fur box is able to repress gene expression upon exposure to high iron concentrations.
We cloned out and characterised a Fur transcription factor .
We cloned a Neisserial Ferric binding protein A ( FbpA ) as a BioBrick.
We generated a fusion of Pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) and Alcohol dehydrogense B (AdhB). We characterised it thoroughly and demonstrated that such co-localisation can increase ethanol production at least twofold.
We cloned SinR and analysed biofilm formation in WT B.subtilis.
We had a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
