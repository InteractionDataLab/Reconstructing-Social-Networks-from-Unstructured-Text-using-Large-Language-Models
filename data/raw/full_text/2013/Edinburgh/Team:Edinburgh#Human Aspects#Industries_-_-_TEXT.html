Scottish industries
Three of the highest profile industries native to Scotland are whisky, textiles and leather. Scottish whisky is famous the world over, and has a significant impact on the Scottish economy through exports and tourism. Traditional textiles such as tweed and plaid, used in the production of the iconic kilt, have seen a resurgence in recent years due to the success of the tourism and fashion industries in Scotland, and through events such as the 2009 ‘Homecoming’, which encouraged those of Scottish ancestry to visit their homeland. The leather industry has been a staple of the Scottish economy since the Industrial revolution and still plays a key role today. Along the lines of tourism, the whisky industry in Scotland is an ever-present mainstay that people travel the world to visit. The Scottish whisky industry represent a niche and coveted market that only traditional distilleries can fill, in both the highlands and  the lowlands.
