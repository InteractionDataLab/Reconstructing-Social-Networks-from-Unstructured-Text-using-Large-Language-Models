As part of our Human Practices, we did some research into how toxic waste waters are to people and the environment, and into the currently existing waste water treatment technologies. Knowing more about the currently existing technologies would allow us to understand better the needs of the industry and to create a system which is competitive and hopefully better than modern-day technologies.
