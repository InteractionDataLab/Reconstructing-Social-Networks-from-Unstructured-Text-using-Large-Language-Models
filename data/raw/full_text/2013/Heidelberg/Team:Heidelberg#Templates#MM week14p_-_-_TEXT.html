From 2013.igem.org
2013-07-29
1 µl of pLF03 miniPrep from 2013-06-04
make miniPrep -> very low yield (1-2 ng/µl)
load 1µl of 97ng/µl pLF03 miniPrep from 2013-06-04 on gel -> ca. 20 ng/µl
inoculate 50 ml LB+Amp with TOP10-pLF03, grow at 37°C
2013-07-30
1 µl of pLF03 midiPrep from 2013-07-30
make midiPrep -> 1352 ng/µl in 66.5 µl
medium was contaminated (also check with Fanny) -> low yields of previous miniPreps
2013-07-31
send 20 µl of 1:15 dilution of midiPrep to sequencing with primers IK07, IK36, IK37: File:Heidelberg PLF03 seq 2013-07-31.zip
perform multiple sequence alignment against assumed pLF03 sequence: IK07 , IK36 , IK37
deletion at the end of accA2 -> primer can not bind
