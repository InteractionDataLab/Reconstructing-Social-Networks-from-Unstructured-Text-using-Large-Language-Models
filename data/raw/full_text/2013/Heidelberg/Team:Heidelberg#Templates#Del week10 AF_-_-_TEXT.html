Results:
Amplification of DelAE worked
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
sample has to be purified before further use since contamination with propanol was present

Results:
Amplification of DelAE worked
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit resulting in a final concentratio of 10ng/µL
PCR will be repeated and gel slices purified with QIAX II Gel Extraction Kit, which is specifically designed to deliver higher yields when purifying fragments with sizes over 10 kbp
