BioBrick Characterization
Test Digest
We digested 400 ng of each of our parts BBa_K1152008 to BBa_K1152019 with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI. We used 0.5 ul enzyme and incubated the reaction at 37 °C for 2 hours. We submitted the plasmids pKH6-10, pRB22, pRB23, pRB23-T8, -T10, -T12, -T13 and -T14.
The digest is positive and the fragment sizes are correct. Together with the sequencing results we can be sure that our submitted parts are alright.
