Colony-PCR of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR amplificate of pLF03 grown on Cm+IPTG. Lanes 1-6: annealing at 66°C; lanes 8-11: touch-down 66->60°C; lane 6: NEB 2-log; lane 1,7: negative control (BAP1-pLF03); lane 2,8: colony-PCR of colony electroporated with gel-extracted PCR product; rest: colony-PCRs of colonies electroporated with PCR-purified PCR product.
repeat colony PCR, use 1 µl of liquid culture from gel-extracted plate, pick colonies from PCR-purified plate (Taq, 25 µl total volume)

Gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplificate. Lane 1: NEB 2-log ladder; lanes 2-5: PCR with Phusion Flash (2 µl of product were put on gel)
prepare for repetition of experiment: run 4 PCRs of 1 ng pLF03 (miniPrep from 2013-06-04) with primers ygfG21C1 and ygfG21C2 using Phusion Flash (performed by Dominik), one reaction = 50 µl total volume

Gel electrophoresis of the purified PCR amplificate. Lane 1: NEB 2-log ladder; lane 2: purified PCR with Phusion Flash (1 µl of product were put on gel)
pool products, purify (digestion only 3 h)
nanoDrop: 2088 ng/µl -> remeasure: 532 ng/µl
load 1 µl purified PCR product on gel -> very weak band -> nanoDrop wrong
to eliminate error: make fresh electrocompetent cells:
pick colony from BAP1-pKD46 plate from 2013-06-04
inoculate 1 ml LB + Amp
grow at 30°C
2013-06-20
too little cells: use aliquot from 2013-06-06
use all available DNA (14 µl) and 100 µl cells (complete aliquot)
grow in SOC + IPTG(1mM) at 300 rpm for 3h
spin cells down, decant supernatant, resuspend in remainder of medium
plate 10 µl, rest on Cm + IPTG
