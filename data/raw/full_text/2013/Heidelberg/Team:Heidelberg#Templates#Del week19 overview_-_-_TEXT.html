Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Del week19 overview
From 2013.igem.org
Validation of pFSN
SDS-PAGE will be repeated to analyze expression of Del genes from our plasmid pFSN
Results
This week we appiled the samples of week 18 on an SDS-PAGE again, as last time we were able to detect DelE, but only saw a band at the height of DelG which was so weak that it could not be captured on a photograph. Therefore we applied more of the samples. The results were positiv. A band could be detected at about 360 kDa was visible. The band of DelE was present again as well. Therefore we were able to prove that DelG is also expressed. As the genes DelA, DelB, DelC, DelD and DelF are regulated by the same promotor as DelE and DelG we assume that these proteins are expressed likewise.
