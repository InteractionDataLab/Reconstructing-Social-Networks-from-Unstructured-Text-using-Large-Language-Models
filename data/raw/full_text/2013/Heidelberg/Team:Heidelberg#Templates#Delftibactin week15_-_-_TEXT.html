Melting Gold Nanoparticles to Solid Gold
Step 1: Cultivation of D. acidovorans
200 ml ACM medium were inocculated with recently obtained D. acidovorans SPH-1 from glycerol stock and incubated at 30°C for 3 days.
Step 2: Precipitation of Gold Nanoparticles
D. acidovorans culture in ACM was divided in 50 ml aliquots and centrifuges at 3,750 rpm for 30 min.
Supernatant was transferred to fresh tube.
300 µl gold chloride stock solution [µg/ml] was added to D. acidovorans supernatant, suspention mixed and incubated at RT for 20 min.

Alternatively, we also performed the protocol described above in a 2 ml tube.
