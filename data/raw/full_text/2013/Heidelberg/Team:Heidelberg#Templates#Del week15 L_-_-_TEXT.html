Results Sequencing
Send the following samples (amplified fragments of D. acidovorans DSM-39 and backbone pSB4K5 from the partsregistry) to GATC for sequencing:
DelL (FS_14 to FS_15) with Primer FS_14
DelL (FS_14 to FS_15) with Primer FS_15
Alignment of DelL(FS_14 to FS_15) with Primer FS_14
Alignment of DelL(FS_14 to FS_15) with Primer FS_15
Amplification of DelL (FS_14 to FS_15; 1.4 kb)
Amplifcation of DelOP and DelL (07.08); run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE)

Results:
Amplification worked very well, we had bright bands on the right height.
Bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extration Kit.
