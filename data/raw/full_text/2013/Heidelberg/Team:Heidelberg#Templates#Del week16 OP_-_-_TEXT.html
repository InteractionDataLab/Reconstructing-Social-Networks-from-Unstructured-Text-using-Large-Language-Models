Results:
Amplification of DelOP did not work
PCR will be repeated at very high annealing temperatures to ensure that primers with very complex secondary structure such as the Gibson-Primer FS_13long are able to bind

Results:
Amplification of DelOP was successful, 2-step PCR with FS_22-FS_13s as template led to expected bands as well as a slight smear and an unintended product
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
PCR will be repeated to obtain more sample

Results:
Amplification of DelOP was successfull
The gradient PCR shows that amplification worked best with an annealing temperature of 72.3°C, interestingly this annealing temperature was used for the remaining mastermix of the gradient PCR which included more DMSO than the other samples as mixing of DMSO often is not perfect and therefore the very last sample is of higher DMSO concentration
Therefore PCR will be repeated with an annealing temperature of 72.3°C and 10% DMSO
