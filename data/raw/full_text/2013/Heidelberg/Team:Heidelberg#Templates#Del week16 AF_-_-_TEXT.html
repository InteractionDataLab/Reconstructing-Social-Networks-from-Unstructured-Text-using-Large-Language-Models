Results:
Amplification of DelAF worked well, gradient displays an optimal annealing temperature of 65.5°C, which will be used for further amplifications
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit

Weak bands of about 4.6kbp visible, as well as on of about 2.6kbp
digest will be repeated using higher concentrations of DNA to clearify results of restriction digest
