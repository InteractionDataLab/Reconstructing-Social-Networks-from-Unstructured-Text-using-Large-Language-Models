Restyling filters including javascript and css
In order to have the whole apps in a compact layout, the filters were put into a notebook. To navigate and style this javascript and css had to be included. This works through the simple "includeHTML()"-function shiny contains.
The tab heading are implemented as a unordered list containing links. These links activate a javascript, which shifts between the containers displayed in the notebook. This works by first hiding all containers in that area and then showing the one that was specified as parameter, when calling the function from the link.
The style of the tabs and the notebook were adjusted to match the border color and radius of the bootstrap styled elements.
Adjustments to page design
To allow for proper presentation in meetings, the design of the test-homepage was adjusted to current wiki design.
