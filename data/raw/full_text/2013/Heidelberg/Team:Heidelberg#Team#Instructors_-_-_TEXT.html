Over the past years, Heidelberg successfully participated in the iGEM competition. Also in 2013, the team is supervised by Prof. Dr. Roland Eils and Dr. Barbara Di Ventura from the Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg, the BioQuant as well as the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg.
Prof. Dr. Roland Eils
Prof. Eils is again the head of the iGEM Heidelberg team. He provides the laboratories and all the required equipment. Besides, he will sponsor the traveling and participation costs. Thank you very much! The research interests of Prof. Eils lies in the field of the analysis and mathematical modeling of complex pathways in molecular biology. He can look back at a very successful career, as he is the head of the Department of Theoretical Bioinformatics in the DKFZ and working on computational oncology. Furthermore, he is the director of the Department of Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics of the IPMB at the University of Heidelberg. Alongside Prof. Kräusslich and Prof. Wolfrum, he is one of three founding directors of the BioQuant, as well as the leader of the Systems Biology Center and the representative of the FORSYS-Initiative of Heidelberg’s research network, the ViroQuant. He has won numerous awards; in particular he has been awarded the Biofuture price (approx. 1.2 Million €) by the BMBF for innovations allowing the graphical reconstruction of the eukaryotic mitosis process from 4D microscopy images and in the year 2005 he won the award for new innovative research by Helmholtz Society: “SystemsBiology of Complex Diseases”. Besides, he was one of the main organizers of the International Conference on Systems Biology in Heidelberg 2004 and he organized the German Symposium on Systems Biology 2009. His new engagement in the up-coming field of Synthetic Biology underlines the need for tight interdisciplinary work between experimentalists and theoreticians.

Dr. Barbara Di Ventura
Computer engineer by university training (carried out in the University of Rome “La Sapienza”), Barbara has done her Ph.D. in molecular biology in the laboratory of Luis Serrano, at the EMBL. Her Ph.D. project consisted in constructing a synthetic human p53 network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. She was post-doc in the laboratory of Victor Sourjik, at the ZMBH. During this time she investigated the self-organizing properties of the Min system, the protein machinery that in Escherichia coli defines mid-cell. Starting from November 2011, Barbara heads the Synthetic Biology group in the department of Roland Eils, at the BioQuant. Barbara believes in the power of synthetic biology to create new functional devises and to teach important lessons about real biological systems. She also thinks that combining theory and experiments is the best strategy to understand the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. Barbara finds the iGEM competition truly exciting and she is very happy to mentor the young, motivated and enthusiastic students of the Heidelberg iGEM 2013 team!
