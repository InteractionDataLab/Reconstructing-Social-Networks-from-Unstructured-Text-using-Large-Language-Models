This amplification did not make sense, two reverse Primer were used. We mixed up Primer FS_24 with Primer FS_26.

Results:
Amplification of DelEG did not work, neither with annealing at a constant temperature of 65°C nor with a touchdown starting from 68°C
later on it was discovered, that primers had been mixed up
