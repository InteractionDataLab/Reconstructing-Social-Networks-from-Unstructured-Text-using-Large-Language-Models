Testing of Screening Primers
To test the reverse screening primer DN07 we amplify with the DreamTaqPolymerase and DN11 primer. As template, we use the complete DelH (18 Kb) and the first 3/4 of DelH (14 Kb).

Gel shows expected bands.
=> Both PCRs were positive. Proof of functionality of DN07 screening primer and that both fragments are the expected DelH fragments.
Amplification of DelH G0
Gradient PCR Conditions G0.W16.B
To improve the PCR of the fragment with the length of 18 Kb, we run a gradient PCR between 68°C and 65°C.

l2-5: show not the expected band at 18Kb. l6-9 show the expected band at 13.5 Kb and was cut out. But it shows also other unspecific bands.
Gel does not show expected band.
=> Further optimize PCR conditions.
PCR Conditions G0.W16.C
Because the amplification of DelH GO didn't work yesterday, we try it again with one picked colony and 1 µl of a glycerol stock at a constant annealing temperature of 65°C. 65°C was the temperature on which it worked the last time.
