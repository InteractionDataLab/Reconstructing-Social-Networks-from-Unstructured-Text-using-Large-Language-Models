Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Indigoidine week21 overview
From 2013.igem.org
BioBricks for the Registry
This week we prepared our parts for submission to the registry. We submitted the coding sequences of indC, sfp, svp, entD and delC, as well as expression constructs coding for indC with the exchanged T-domains that resulted in a blue phenotype. These are pRB22 and pRB23-T8, -T10, -T12, -T13, -T14. We also submitted our construct in which the indC-T-Domain is exchanged by the ccdB gene.
A table of all the parts we submitted can be found on the Parts site.
Engineered indC – Quantitative Assay
We started with the detailled characterization of our engineered indC-variants using a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader to measure the absorbance spectra of 52 liquid cultures of different (co-)transformants over time. The table in the detailled lab journal shows the loading scheme of our 96 well plate and the transformants we used.
Since a variant of indC, where the T-domain has been exchanged by the bpsA T-domain with the specific domain borders b31 resulted in a blue phenotype, we ordered primers to try other native T-Domains with these newly defined domain borders.
