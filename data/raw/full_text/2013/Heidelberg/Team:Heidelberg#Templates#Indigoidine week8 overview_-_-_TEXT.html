Indigoidine Production - bpsA
We performed PCR screenings of the pMM64 (bpsA) and pMM65 (svp) plasmid for validation.
The PCR screenings showed that the pMM-plasmids are correct. We designed primers to assemble our first pSB1C3 derived plasmid pKH1, which carries both the bpsA and the svp gene with the lacI-Promoter BBa_R0010 and the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 before both the bpsA and the svp gene, respectively..
