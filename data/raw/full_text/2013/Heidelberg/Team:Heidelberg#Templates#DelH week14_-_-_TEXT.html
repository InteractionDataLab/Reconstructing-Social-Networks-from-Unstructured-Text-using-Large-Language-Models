Generation of DelH Plasmid 28-07
Purification of Gibson Mix
10 µl of the Gibson mix were isopropanol purified as described in the protocol .
5 µl of the Gibson reaction were mixed with 10 µl ddH2O.
Electroporation
Electroporation into freshly prepared electrocompetent cell following the protocol .
E1
E2
E3
5 µl of Gibson + 10 µl H2O
10 µl of isoprop purified Gibson assembly
no DNA
Grow 0.5 h with 400 µl SOC at 37°C
Add 9 ml LB Amp and incubate 3 h at 37°C
Incubate ON at 37°C on LB Amp plate as well as LB (no Amp) for control purposes
Result
There were few colonies on the plates. Red colonies were picked and screenied by colony-PCR, but none of them was positive. The Gibson assembly has to be repeated.

'l1: 2log, l2-6: 5 seperate colonies which were together in 3a PCR earlier, l7-11: 5 seperate colonies which were together in 4b PCR earlier,
no bands = no colony positive
=> No band is visible. There should be a band at at least one of each sample (for example 6B), because in the previous PCR we observed a band.
Because of the explained reason above we incubated 40 colonies seperately which might be positive ON at 37°C in 200 µl LB Amp. 200 µl of the ON cultire was mixed with 1.8 ml LB Amp for five colonies of each probe: 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 6a, 6b, 6d.
