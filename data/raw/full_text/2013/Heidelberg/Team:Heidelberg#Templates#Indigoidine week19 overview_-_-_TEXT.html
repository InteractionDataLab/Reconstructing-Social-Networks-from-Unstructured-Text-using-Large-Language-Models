Domain Shuffling – PPTase Plasmids
The PPTase plasmids pRB15-18 have been reassembled with pSB3K3 from a different plate of the partsdistribution, using a CPEC approach. This week we validated those plasmids. Additionally, we assembled them by restriction cloning.
T-Domain Shuffling
Last week we assembled pKH4, which is a pSB1C3 derived plasmid coding for indC but lacking a PPTase. We validated the plasmid and used it as the template to assemble pKH5 in which the T-domain of indC were replaced by ccdB. In parallel and as a backup strategy, we assembled pRB19 using restriction cloning.
As a second backup strategy, we assembled pRB22 and pRB23 using CPEC with single fragments that were amplified from a P. luminescens cell pellet.
Both pKH5 and pRB22 were correct as seen by PCR screenings and sequencing. We used pRB22 to assemble pRB23, which is the ccdB-variant of pRB22, enabling to test every combination of T-domain in co-expression with the four PPTases.
