Team:Heidelberg/Templates/M-29-07-13
From 2013.igem.org
Judging criteria
no dates online yet
we have to select three tracks -> which ones?
our favorites (until now):
- Manufacturing - foundational Advance - environment
project description can be adjusted until wiki freeze (but is no judging criteria): make it more lurid (abstract as well) and integrate synthetic biology better
Freiburg constructs
characterize constructs? => Help another Team criteria
but these are eucaryotic constructs
check on different cell lines, media and digests
critical because incubator could be contaminated by us -> disastrous for Di Ventura group
we have no cell culture -> send cell lines to Freiburg instead
we have to fulfill one of three gold medal requirements (Parts debugging, characterize other parts, essay on safety/environment/effects of proeject)
characterize SFP? Has not been submitted -> cannot do it -> re-submit pptases
essay backup solution
Plan for Tomorrow (Meeting with Roland Eils)
Milestones
Short lab update
Indigoidine [as a new reporter system; try all suggested T-domains; show benefits of software for Indigoidine project]
Software [set up criteria, which describe similarity of modules, e.g. by literature research, Nikos will ask a member of König group, who worked with t-domains, for help]
Tyrocidine [detection: Wombacher group; in-vitro/in-vivo in parallel; maybe his-tag?; HPLC before? -> enrichment of fragments; CPEC as alternative for Gibson (worked for Ralf); e. coli lysate (e.g. in-vitro translation); do some literature research on how other groups detected NRPs; non-proteinogenic amino acids for labeling; concentration gradients native <-> transformed; contact Mr. Lehmann]
Del H [wait for results (tomorrow)]
Del Rest [waiting for digestion results; Have all fragments, but F-G is too yet]
Software [meeting tomorrow before Eils meeting? Present our scheme of the last meeting + slides of subteams]
send all slides to Philipp until 3.30 p.m. tomorrow
