After an incubation time of 1 h in SOC-medium, cells were centrifuged and 10 µl plated on one LB Amp plate (with Arabinos and X-Gal) and 100 µl on another plate prepared with the same conditions.
Plates were incubated ON at 37°C.
Result
White colonies grew on the plates.
Colony PCR
6 colonies of plate E1 (colonies 1-6) and 6 colonies of plate E2 (7-12) as well as ligation mixes 1 & 2 were checked by PCR.

l2-3: shows expected band at 663 bp
None of the colonies shows a band. Ligation mixes 1 and 2 show the expected band at ~600 bp.
=> The ligation worked, but none of the correct plasmids were present in the analyzed colinies.
