1 NRPS – Delfibactin project
2 GHB
3 Artificial yeast-cells for sensing Insulin-level and producing/distribute the Insulin
4 Software Project
5 work for the next weeks
6 Agenda for next meeting (29.04.2013 at 5 pm)
NRPS – Delfibactin project
by Ilia
1. delfibactin:
export from biocompartiments: unspecific outer membrane transporter (so delfibactin gets into medium)
synthesis: pathway known, e.coli strain for production (maybe not clone DelC)
2. NRPS: introduction
modular enzymes: 3 modular domains (together 110 kDa)
steps: adenylation, acylation, condensation
3. software: input
match amino acid to known A-domain substrates
recognize easy modification (in amino acids) for which substrate you need it
method: substructure based algorithm for searching and predicting substrate specifity
it works in a R-package
10 amino acids are important for the substrate specifity
4. biobrick library
there is no standard for the Biobricks of NRPS
GHB
by Flo and Nils
1. Jugend forscht: done a test (we do not understand how it works)
not reached the supervisor yet
she didn't win anything
detect it via Spectrometry
2. 3 ideas for integrating the receptor
artifiial membranes are not an option (you can't predict how the protein is located)
in vitro expression of GPCRs (takes too long)
Luciferase activity under directt ligand-dependent control of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
=> measurments possible (very sensitive: represses glowing a little bit, a bit more... but never completely) (integrate it is fast, but the mutagenesis takes a long time)
Artificial yeast-cells for sensing Insulin-level and producing/distribute the Insulin
by Flo
presentation of the idea and past igem projects regarding this theme
semipermeable biocapsules (with cells inside)
the cells (yeast , bacillus subtilis, e.coli... ) for producing insulin if it is necessary
there exists a famous lab for synthetic biology which works on insulin production
Software Project
by Julia, Konrad and Hanna
parameters for statistical analysis and how they correlate (like teammembers, advisors, organsims, score regarding a scoring funtion)
graphics: basically histograms
work for the next weeks
1. software project
look on the focus of the team!
better definition of the parameters
estimate the cost of an IGEM project (there exists something for the nature paper... just looking at the methods etc...)
already made something with these parameters
clustering for example, not only directed
software project should be finished before the lab phase: end of June/ July
2. Gold Project
working on this project: Nils, Ilia, Julia, Ralf, Hanna
find stuff we have to order and send Dominik an email => done!
talk to companies (interested, is it done already and how, are there established assays)
find succesful examples
3. general information
we have to register and then apply for the team. LogIn
send an email for getting the contact details (parameters which here already used)
Agenda for next meeting (29.04.2013 at 5 pm)
results of pilot project (delfibactin in the lab)
present a project plan (goals, time etc.)
update on the software project. How to proceed etc.
