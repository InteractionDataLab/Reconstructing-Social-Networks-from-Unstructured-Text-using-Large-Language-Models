Results:
Amplification of DelAF did not work as no product appeared, therefore conditions of PCR have to be optimized
as extremely long amplicons in the past were usually easier to amplify from agar plate (colony PCR) the same conditions will be tried on the colony as template

Results:

PCR will be repeated with a higher annealing temperature as primers might not have bound due to secondary structes
PCR will be repeated with lower annealing temperatue as primers might not have bound due to high temperatures

Results:
Amplification of DelAF did not work at a temperature of 58°C constant
as primers might not have been bound at this low temperatue but neither bound at a temperature of 68°C (touchdown or constant), PCR will be repeated at a temperature of 65°C as touchdown and at constant annealing

Results:
Amplification of DelAF from the new strain finally worked, both conditions (65°C constant and 65°C touchdown) led to specific product but the touchdown PCR resulted in a smear
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
PCR will be repeated with a slightly lower temperature with constant annealing to increase yield but avoid the smear which appeared due to the low annealing temperatures used in the last cycles of the touchdown PCR.

Results:
Amplification of DelAF worked out though again a smear and several other bands appeared
bands were cut out very precise to avoid carry over of any unwanted amplicon and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
gradient PCR will be carried out to determine optimal annealing temperature of primers and thereby obtain product of higher specificity suitable for gibson assembly
