in silico PCR of BB shows the following result:
2 fragments generated:
1:    3.998 bp  -  From NotI[9]       To  NotI[4007]
2:    1.093 bp  -  From NotI[4007]    To  NotI[9]
But an additional band between 1-2 Kb is present!
=> Talk to Advisors, because it isn't what we expected. What could it be?
Possible next steps:
a) Wait for the new strain of D. acidovorans SHP1
b) Perform a re-PCR of minipreps (one with BB and one with DelH G0 fragment)
Generation of Backbone pSB6A1-lacI-mRFP
Restriction Digest with DpnI
After consulting the advisors, we decided not to continue the strategy with the old construct and wait with DelH until the new strain of D. acidovorans arrives. Until then, we digest the backbone (which is used also in following experiments) with DpnI to get rid of any remaining template.

Purification
As template, the PCR of 10,4 PCR, which was digested with DpnI on 06-08, was used.
Purification was performed with nucleotide removal kit (wrong column was used, but there was some yield at the nanodrop)
=> Again, checking on gel (2 µl + 8 µl 1xloading dye)

Picked 8 colonies from plates with 10µl and 100 µl construct 1, and plate with 100 µl of construct 2. 1 additional colony was picked from plate with 10 µl of construct 2 (because there were no more cells) and 1 colony of the control(100µl), and one colony of the control (100µl) with new electrocompetent cells.
In the following table construct 1 is named C1, and construct 2 = C2 and Control = Co

Gel shows no banda at 663 bp. Instead, they show an unexpected band at ~6 Kb.
=> None of the colonies is positive.
Conoly-PCR Conditions CP.W15.B
Picked 20 colonies from plates with 10 µl and 100 µl construct 1 and construct 2 (80 colonies). 4 colonies were picked from the control (10 µl) and control (100 µl).
In the following table construct 1 is named C1, and construct 2 = C2 and Control = Co

Expected band: 663 bp
Fig.15.13 screening PCR with DN07 & VF2 (loaded 1 µL of PCR)
l1-9: colonies A-I, l10:2log ladder, l11-17: colonies J-P, l12:2log ladder, l13-18: PCR performed with 6 colonies of the control plate
Neither the colonies A-P show the expected band nor the control shows any band
=> New Gibson Assembly will be performed
Gel shows no banda at 663 bp.
=> Neither the colonies A-P show the expected band, nor the control shows any band.
Generation of DelH Plasmid 11-08
Gibson Assembly
Because of the past results, we assume that the colonies can grow because the backbone religates. We also found out that the first overhang of the backbone has some homologity with a sequence at the end and we can assume that with Gibson, it primes itself.
So in the following step we will use less backbone. We prepared an 1:10 dilution of the backbone construct.

The time constant for the electroporation was unexpectedly low, hopefully high enough...
