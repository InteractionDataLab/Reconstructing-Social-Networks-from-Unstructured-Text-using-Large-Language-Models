5 Delftibactin subgroup
6 Miscellaneous
7 Agenda for next meeting (15.05.2013)
NRPS subgroup (Julia, Philipp)
Possible cloning standards
Handing in biobricks only in pSB1C3 (RFC10 standard)
RFC25 (scar 6bp) standard because RFC10 scar (7 bp) causes frameshift
Parts to be cloned from Tyc
T domains either in front of E or in front of C --> cloning 1 per group
A and C as single domains and as couple in parallel
E domains and Thioesterase
Cutting sites
not in Tyc A/B/C SpeI, EcoRI, XbaI, NgoMIV
Tyc B NgOMIV in C domain, in T-C linker
Tyc C PStI in CIII domain, NotI in AIII domain
Indigoidine subgroup
Plasmid optimised for eucariotic cells
Impossible to clone it as RFC10
Use RFC21 instead -> compatible with Tyc?
first as whole part
Can be transformed wihtin in this week
primer design within this week
Cloning standard discussion
Gibson!!!
find good reason, concept for Gibson cloning
standard cloning techniques unfeasible
Further plan
Order all he plasmids and strains for permeable strain (BAP1  strain, red plasmid, FLP plasmid, template plasmid)
Indigoidine (Ralf) RFC 21 + check for other NRPS (Ilia) pathways
Modularity of Indigoidine RFC 21
in parallel check on Gibson assembly in Freiburg (Dominik)
get Backbones from Washington (Fanny)
Software subgroup (Konrad)
subgroups for data mining, data management, statistical analysis, front end
right now mainly building data management + concept for frontend and analysis
starting with NRPS software only makes sense as soon as NRPS gives any positive results
next one and a half weeks for being productive and then we decide for or against the project
Delftibactin subgroup
8 and 10 kb successfully amplified
digest tomorrow
Ligating AraC promotor this week
If cloning in E.coli doesn't work we skip Del or search for different organism (next week earliest)
definitely no restrictiton based cloning -> depending on Gibson cloning technique
Miscellaneous
Send EMail to registry: How to submit parts? , Promote system open for new standards. (Fanny)
We should find a plan B for Delftibactin!
in vitro parts expression, ex vivo delftibactin synthesis?
Agenda for next meeting (15.05.2013)
State of the lab (Hanna)
Further plan (Fanny)
Gibson approach (Flo, Nikos)
Enzymatic cloning and dependencies of NRPS and indigoidine (Nikos)
Software project deadlinev + plan (Julia, Philipp)
Budgetplanung (Prof. Eils)
