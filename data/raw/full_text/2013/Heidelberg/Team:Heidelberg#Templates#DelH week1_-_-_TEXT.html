Added 10 µl H2O to each well
Incubated for 10 min at RT
Thawed 5x chemical competent E.coli Top10
3 µl of plasmid DNA were added
Incubated for 10 min on ice
Heat shock for 40 s at 42.2°C
Incubated for 10 min on ice
Added 500 µl LB Medium
Incubated at 37°C for 40 min
Centrifuged 120 at 5,000 rpm, supernatant discarded
Pellet resuspended in remaining medium
Plated on plates with the corresponding antibiotics (as shown in the table above, section: resistances)
Incubated for 2 days at RT
One colony was picked from each plate and incubated over night at 37°C in LB medium with the antibiotic listed above
Result
All 5 parts from the Registry Distribution 2012 were successfully transformed in E.coli Top10 except for the one containing the AraC promotor.
