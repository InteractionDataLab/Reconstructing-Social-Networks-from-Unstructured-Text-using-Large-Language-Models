Second app implemented
The second shiny app we impelmented was the timeline app. It counts teams, awards or students within each year and puts the numbers in a bar plot. For the plot we again use RCharts but this time with nvd3. In order to prevent errors we had to add empty values to the data since nvd3 can't handle incomplete datasets.
First hompage draft
A simple draft of the homepage was implemented using basic html and css tags.
This page is supposed to either become integrated in our wiki or to be a stand alone homepage.

App integration
In order to integrate the apps, the central iframe was used as target for the links in the menu bar. The link would then for example look like this:
<a href="apps/factsfigures/" target="center-frame">Facts & figures</a>
