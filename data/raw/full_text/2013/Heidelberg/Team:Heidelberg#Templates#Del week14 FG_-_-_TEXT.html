Furthermore, amplification with FS_21 to FS_26 led to the intended product and satisfying specifity
Amplification will be repeated at the same annealing temperature to obtain the amount of PCR product required for Gibson Assembly
Amplfication will be repeated at lower annealing temperature to increase the yield
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit

Results:
Restriction digest of DelFG with XmaI did not lead to the expected result
digest will be carried out with a different enzyme, as the used one was outdated and digest might therefore not be very reliable
