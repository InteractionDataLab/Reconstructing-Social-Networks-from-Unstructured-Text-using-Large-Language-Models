Vector Maps and Primers
Strategy A: weak Promotor, weak RBS
Expression of the possibly toxic DelH module on pFS02 is minimized by usage of a weak promoter: BBa_J23114 as well as a weak RBS: BBa_0032.
Vector map of the weak promotor and weak RBS DelH plasmid pFS02 (pSB6A1_BBa_J23114_BBa_B0032_DelH) Gibson plasmid .

Gibson-Primer rev, amplify the Backbone pSB6A1 introducing the
RBS BBa_B0032 and the promotor BBa_J23114  and
creating an overlap to the first fragment of
DelH amplified with primer DN_11

Strategy B: ccdB Construct
Selection for mutated and thus truncated DelH sequences will be minimized by using a ccdB strategy. DelH will be integrated in a pSB4K5 backbone flanked by KpnI and BamHI sites (pFS02). The pSB6A1 backbone will be assembled with a ccdB cassette flanked by KpnI and BamHI sites (pFS03). The final DelH plasmid will be assembled by restriction - ligation of pFS02 and pFS03 to pFS05.
