Different concepts for shiny files
Since there are two different concepts of how to implement the page surrounding a shiny app, we tried out both.
See week 20 for the final solution we chose for building our apps.
R builder functions for html
Files needed:
./server.R
./ui.R
This solution turned out to be very complicated due to the combination of directly accessible html tags, those which need the tags() function and styling rules within the ui.R. Thus using the other concept seems more intuitive.
Separated html code
File needed:
./server.R
./www/index.html
Here the app is built directly in html and css syntax as any other basic homepage. This on the other hand became complicated, when integrating the server output in the app.
