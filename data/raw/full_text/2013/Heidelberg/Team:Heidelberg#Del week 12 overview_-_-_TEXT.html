Strategy
Vector map of pFSN plasmid including Primers FS_01 to FS_241 used for assembly of the desired genes from the D. acidovorans genome and the partsregistry backbone pSB4K5 .
As we discovered Prediction Konrad that there is a predicted promoter located right in front of DelO, we decided to include this promotor into our construct. This should ensure that the genes DelO, DelP and DelL are still expressed in the case that there is a terminator by the end of DelG. For this we designed primer FS_22 which binds right at the predicted promoter. However, this also meant, that we had to change the reverse primer for the DelG fragment in order to enable Gibson assembly of these fragments next to each oterh. Furthermore we created new primers for amplifying DelE, DelF and DelG as we were not successful in amplifying these fragments so far. These primers now offer more potential fragment combinations which can be tested. We hope to get the missing fragments with this  new strategy.
The ordered primers, their functions and sequences are listed below:

Goals
This week we will try  to amplify the sequence region of DelF-G with several combinations of primers including both, the intial primers and the recently ordered ones beeing FS_20, FS_21, FS_22, FS_23, FS_24 and FS_26. Furthermore we will continue opimtizing our protocol for the amplification of DelO-P. To evaluate whether the very weak bands on the corresponding agarose gels represent the intended amplicons, we decided to carry out re PCR and test restriction digests.
