Results:
Amplification of DelFG did not work with FS_20 to FS_09
as PCR worked with a different set of Primers beeing FS_21 to FS_09, see below, the PCR for this primer combination will be optimized instead of using FS_20 to FS_09

Results:
Amplification worked with FS_21 to FS_09 but not with FS_20 to FS_09
band was cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
PCR will be repeated to get rid of side product at about 1.5 kb as well as smear, therefore annealing temperature will be increased

Results:
Amplification of DelFG did not work only an uneqxpected band a smear occured, but the intended product was not detectable
other primer combinations might be tried or PCR has to be repeated with the previous conditions not leading to an optimal product quality
