In Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis, peptides are produced by multienzyme complexes, the NRPS, which form an assembly line, in which every NRPS module is responsible for the incorporation of one single amino acid into the growing peptide chain (for more detailled information on the NRPS system, please visit our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/NRPS">Background Page</A> to see our NRPS introduction video)[1]. As previously shown, the natural NRPS assembly lines can be rearranged to create novel assembly lines producing custom peptides (please find our experiments on the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project/Tyrocidine">Peptide Synthesis Page</A>)[2]. Since the detection of those custom peptides remained challenging when produced <I>in vivo</I>, we developped a method which enables the labelling of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) with the blue pigment indigoidine (please find our experiments on the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project/Indigoidine-Tag">Indigoidine-Tag Page</A>). The Indigoidine-Tag enables for applying high-throughput methods in the creation of NRPS libraries as well as in detection, purification and validation of synthetic NRPs (please find our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/RFCs">RFC Page</A> for standardized high-throughput protocols). Custom short peptides might have a great potential for production in industrial scale. Therefore, we try to optimize the efficiency of the indigoidine synthetase indC, which is used for the Indigoidine-Tag.



The indigoidine synthetase indC from <I>Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii</I> TT01 (DSM15139) consists of an adenylation domain with an internal oxidation domain, a thiolation domain and a thioesterase domain [3]. The A-domain adenylates L-glutamine, which is then attached to the T-domain via a thioester bond. The TE-domain catalyzes the cyclization of the glutamine and cleaves it from the T-domain. Each two  cyclic glutamines are oxidized by the Ox-domain, resulting in the blue pigment indigoidine (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/8/82/Heidelberg_tagopt_fig1.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: The Indigoidine Synthetase IndC Catalyzes the Formation of the Blue Pigment Indigoidine&lt;/b&gt;

We expressed the indigoidine synthetase indC together with the PPTase in different substrains of <I>E. coli</I> to observe their growth behaviour and to get an impression, which substrain is most suitable for our experiments. We used the <I>E. coli</I> substrains MG1655 [4], TOP10 (Invitrogen), NEB Turbo (NEB), BAP1 [5] and Rosetta (Novagen).
In order to optimize the yield of indigoidine produced by indC, we investigated the influence of the T-domain on the enzyme efficiency. Previous studies showed, that exchanging the T-domain of the blue pigment synthetase bpsA from <I>S. lavendulae</I> [6] yields an unfunctional indigoidine synthetase [7].We replaced the T-domain of the wild-type indC with T-domains from several other NRPS modules from different host organisms (<I>S. lavendulae</I>, <I>E. coli</I>, <I>B. parabrevis</I>, <I>D. acidovorans</I>, <I>P. luminescens</I>) observing the change in enzyme efficiency (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/4/46/Heidelberg_tagopt_fig2.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Optimization of the Indigoidine Production by Domain Exchange and Activation by Different PPTases.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;a)&lt;/b&gt; In a first approach, the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase indC is replaced by T-domains from other NRPS modules and fully synthetic T-domains. In NRPS, the growing peptide chain is covalently attached to the T-domain via a thioester bond. In order to optimize the indigoidine synthetase for the use to label non-ribosomal peptides with the indigoidine-tag, we investigated the influence of the interaction between T-domain and PPTase measuring the amount of indigoidine produced by each combination.
&lt;b&gt;b)&lt;/b&gt; The indigoidine synthetase must be activated by PPTase, which transfers the 4'-PPT residue from Coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase. Since the PPTases differ in their substrate specificity, we tried different PPTases to see, which one is most efficient in activating the respective engineered indigoidine synthetase from a).">Fig. 2a</A>) [2][3][6][8]. Moreover, we created seven fully synthetic T-domains based on multiple sequence alignments of 250 NRPS modules and measured the indigoidine yield after insertion into the indigoidine synthetase scaffold. Since the the NRPS T-domains must be activated by a member of the 4'-Phosphopantheteinyl-transferases (PPTases) [9], which differ in their substrate specificity [10], we coexpressed every engineered indigoidine synthetase with PPTases from different host organisms (Sfp from <I>B. subtilis</I> [11], Svp from <I>S. verticillus</I> [12], EntD from <I>E. coli</I> [7], DelC from <I>D. acidovorans</I> [8], NgrA from <I>P. luminescens</I> [14]) (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/4/46/Heidelberg_tagopt_fig2.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Optimization of the Indigoidine Production by Domain Exchange and Activation by Different PPTases.&lt;/b&gt;

With this approach, we learn more about the interaction of T-domains and PPTases and their influence on the NRPS efficiency. Since this combinatorial approach requires the cloning of large plasmid libraries and hundreds of cotransformations, we established HiCT: High-throughput protocols for circular polymerase extension Cloning and Transformation (please find more information on HiCT on our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/RFCs#rfc99">RFC99 Page</A>) based on CPEC assembly [11].

The open reading frame of the native indigoidine synthetase indC was amplified from genomic DNA of <I>P. lumninescens laumondii</I> TT01 (DSM15139) and cloned into a pSB1C3 derived plasmid under the control of an lac-inducible promoter. This indC expression cassette was transformed into different substrains of <I>E. coli</I>, namely DH5alpha, MG1655, BAP1, TOP10 and NEB Turbo. All of these host strains were previously transformed with a pSB3K3 derived expression plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp from <I>B. subtilis</I>, which is commonly used in NRPS studies.

The figure shows five different strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that have been co-transformed with an indC expression plasmid and a sfp expression plasmid. The negative control is &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; TOP10 without a plasmid. All transformants have been grown on LB agar for 48 hours at room temperature, cells were not induced. One can see that even without induction all strains express the indigoidine synthetase and produce the blue pigment indigoidine. However, the strains BAP1 and NEB Turbo grow faster in the first day, exhibiting a white phenotype (data not shown). Colonies on the plate of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; TOP10  are very small and dark blue/ black. Assuming that indigoidine production inhibits cell growth due to its toxicity, we concluded that TOP10 produced the most indigoidine among the strains we tested.

">Fig. 3a</A>, Sfp is able to activate the T-domain of indC as determined by the blue phenotype of the transformed cells.

The blue phenotype developed late after transformation ranging from first blue colonies after 24 h and taking up to three days for visible poduction of the blue pigment. NEB Turbo showed regular colony growth and developed a strong blue phenotype upon induction with IPTG. As all host strains were able to express the functional indigoidine sythetase IndC, further experiments were only conducted with one <I>E. coli</I> strain.

</P><H3>T-Domain Exchanges in IndC Yield Functional Indigoidine Synthetases</H3><P>
The main structural characteristic of NRPSs is their modular composition on different hierarchical levels. The indogoidine synthetase indC is a single module NRPS comprised of the three domains, namely AOxA, T and TE. Since the functionality of this NRPS is detectable by the bare eye, it offers a perfect and simple experimental set-up for proof of principle experiments regarding the interchangeability of domains from different NRPS. Out of the three domains in indC, the T-domain is supposed to exhibit the least substrate specificity and was thus chosen for first domain shuffling approaches. For the initial definition of T-domain boundaries of indC, we used Pfam, a web-tool which allows -amongst other functions- for the prediction of NRPS module and domain boundaries (<A href="Pfam.sanger.ac.uk">Pfam.sanger.ac.uk</A>. Following the boundary prediction, we choose a two-pronged domain shuffling approach: First, we transferred native T-domains derived from either different host species and/or NRPS of entirely different function into the indC indigoidine synthetase (<EM>Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae</EM> ATCC11924 (blue pigment synthetase bpsA) [6], <EM>Brevibacillus parabrevis</EM> (Tyrocidine synthesis cluster) [2], <EM>Delftia acidovorans</EM> SPH-1 (Delftibactin synthesis cluster) [8], <EM>Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii</EM> TT01 (plu2670 and plu2642, unknown function) [14] and <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> MG1655 (entF from enterobactin synthesis cluster) [4]). Second, we deviced three methods for the generation of synthetic T-domains based on different NRPS libraries generated by BLAST search against either specific subranges of host organisms or restricting the query sequence to be BLASTed (<A href="BLAST.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">BLAST.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</A>). The engineered indigoidine synthetases were coexpressed with supplementary PPTases (sfp, svp, entD and delC) in <I>E. coli</I> TOP10 cells (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical">Figure 4: Coexpression of Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases and Supplementary PPTases in <I>E. coli</I>
     In this first experiment, we replaced the indC T-domain with the T-domains of other native NRPS modules (1: wild-type indC, 2: bpsA,3: entF, 4: delH4, 5: delH5, 6: tycA, 7: tycC6, 8: plu2642 and 9: plu2670) and synthetic T-domains (10-16: synT1-7).

In contrast to the synthetic domains 1,3 and 4 which were designed by the consensus method and showed medium to high similarity to the sequence of origin, synthetic domain 5 was generated by the guided random method.
Remarkably, even though 39 out of the 62 amino acids of the original T-domain were exchanged, the indigoidine synthetase with this T-domain was still functional. Closer analysis of the sequence compared to the original indC T-domain sequence showed, that the characteristics of the amino acid sequence, i. e. for instance polar or charged amino acids, were retained in 72 % of the sequence. Also, the GGxS core sequence of the T-domain at which the activation by the PPTas occurs was conserved.

Multiple web-tools exist which offer the prediction of NRPS module and domain boundaries. One of the most common used prediction tools is Pfam which we used as a starting point to determine the best method for defining domain boundaries.

As the previous experiments of shuffled T-domains and different combinations of PPTases showed, there are substantial differences in cell growth and indigoidine production when observed on plates. However, this observations were always of qualitative nature and did not give any insight into quantitative differences. We approached the quantification of indigoidine production in a time-resolved and highly-combinatorial manner: plasmids coding for indC containing all synthetic (4) and native T-domains (3) proven functional by the previous assays were co-transformed with the four functional PPTases. 


The indigoidine production over time (30 hours) was measured at its absorption maximum of 590 nm and corrected for the contribution of the cellular components in the medium as described in the methods.

The indigidine production strongly varies among different combinations of T-domains and PPTases. Notably, one of the engineered indigoidine synthetases is more efficient than the native enzyme itself. This most efficient indigoidine synthetase carries the synthetic T-domain #3. With this remarkable finding we wanted to have a closer view at structural aspects of this enzyme. Currently, the crystal structures of both the native IndC and our optimized variant are investigated by the group of Dr. Bange (Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg).

Motivated by the establishment of the Indigoidine-Tag, which enables the labelling of nonribosomal peptides, we wanted to further investigate the indigoidine synthetase indC [3] and thus the overall NRPS modularity in order to optimize the functionality of the indigoidine tag. In previous studies, direct T-domain exchanges have not been successful in the context of the indigoidine synthetase BpsA from <EM>S. lavendulae</EM> [6][7]. Furthermore, the endogenous PPTase EntD of <EM>E. coli</EM> was considered inefficient in the activation of the blue pigment synthetase BpsA [6]. Therefore, most studies in the field of NRPS are conducted with the PPTase Sfp from <EM>B. subtilis</EM> [11]. The family of 4'-Phosphopantheteinyl-transferases was reported to vary in substrate specificity [11]. Therefore, they can only activate specific NRPS module families [9]. We first investigated the production of indigoidine in five substrains of <EM>E. coli</EM>: TOP10 (Invitrogen), MG1655 [4], NEB Turbo (NEB), BAP1 [5] and Rosetta (Novagen), using an expression plasmid coding for the indigoidine synthetase IndC and the PPTase Sfp. Though differring in their growth behaviour, all substrains showed to be capable of producing the blue pigment indigoidine (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/c/cf/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig6.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Comparison between different &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains and PPTases:&lt;/b&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;a)&lt;/b&gt; Comparison of different &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains examining growth and indigoidine production
The figure shows five different strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that have been co-transformed with an indC expression plasmid and a sfp expression plasmid. The negative control is &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; TOP10 without a plasmid. All transformants have been grown on LB agar for 48 hours at room temperature, cells were not induced. One can see that even without induction all strains express the indigoidine synthetase and produce the blue pigment indigoidine. However, the strains BAP1 and NEB Turbo grow faster in the first day, exhibiting a white phenotype (data not shown). Colonies on the plate of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; TOP10  are very small and dark blue/ black. Assuming that indigoidine production inhibits cell growth due to its toxicity, we concluded that TOP10 produced the most indigoidine among the strains we tested. We used &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; TOP10 for the following experiments.
&lt;b&gt;b)&lt;/b&gt; Comparison between different PPTases concerning overall indigoidine production
The Figure shows &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10 cells co-transformed with indC and four different PPTases (sfp, svp, entD and delC), respectively. The image bottom left shows &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; TOP10 cells without additional PPTase and the negative control is TOP10 without a plasmid.

In our approach, we replaced single domains of the indC indigoidine synthetase module with both respective domains of other NRPS pathways from different organisms and entirely synthetic domains which were created based on multiple sequence alignments of 250 NRPS domains. We also created indC variants, in which different domain borders have been applied for the domain exchange (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/e/eb/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig8.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 6: Determination of required domain borders for T-domain exchange&lt;/b&gt;

The figure shows a sequence alignment of the indC and bpsA amino acid sequences.
The alignment was created using clustalO (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) with
standard parameters. The lines marked A, B and C reflect the borders we used between the A- 
and the T-domain, whereas those marked, 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflect the borders between the T- and

domain border {1, 2, 3, 4}, replacing the sequence inbetween with the respective part of bpsA.

The co-tranformation of the modified indC-(bpsA-T) plasmids described above with a second 
plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp shows that only three domain border combinations can be 
used for exchanging the indC T-domain with the T-domain of bpsA. These are the 
combinations A1, A2 and C1. We applied combination A2 for further T-domain exchanges. ">Fig. 6</A>), since setting the correct linker sequence is crucial for the NRPS function [7]. We used NRPS domains from <EM>Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae</EM> ATCC11924 (blue pigment synthetase bpsA) [6], <EM>Brevibacillus parabrevis</EM> (Tyrocidine synthesis cluster) [2], <EM>Delftia acidovorans</EM> SPH-1 (Delftibactin synthesis cluster) [8], <EM>Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii</EM> TT01 (plu2670 and plu2642, unknown function) [14] and <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> MG1655 (entF from enterobactin synthesis cluster) [4], thus creating a library of 58 different engineered indigoidine synthetases. We co-transformed the 58 indC variants with four different PPTases into <EM>E. coli</EM> TOP10 cells. We used the PPTases Sfp (<EM>Bacillus subtilis</EM> str. 168) [11], Svp (<EM>Streptomyces verticillus</EM> ATCC15003) [12], EntD (<EM>Escherichia coli</EM> MG1655) [7] and DelC (<EM>Delftia acidovorans</EM> SPH-1) [8] and screened them on their functionality. This screening is remarkably easy, because functional indigoidine synthetases result in a blue phenotype when being expressed and activated in <EM>E. coli</EM> cells [3]. We found, that nine engineered indigoidine synthetases, in which the T-domain was replaced, remained functional in producing indigoidine when co-expressed with specific PPTases. The inserted T-domains include four synthetic T-domains (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical">Figure 4: Coexpression of Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases and Supplementary PPTases in <I>E. coli</I>
     In this first experiment, we replaced the indC T-domain with the T-domains of other native NRPS modules (1: wild-type indC, 2: bpsA,3: entF, 4: delH4, 5: delH5, 6: tycA, 7: tycC6, 8: plu2642 and 9: plu2670) and synthetic T-domains (10-16: synT1-7). We also exchanged both the T- and TE-domain by the T- and TE-domain of other natural NRPS modules (17: bpsA, 18: tycC6, 19: delH5).

domain border {1, 2, 3, 4}, replacing the sequence inbetween with the respective part of bpsA.

&lt;b&gt;b)&lt;/b&gt; E. coli TOP10 co-transformed with modified versions of indC and the PPTase sfp
The co-tranformation of the modified indC-(bpsA-T) plasmids described above with a second 
plasmid coding for the PPTase Sfp shows that only three domain border combinations can be 
used for exchanging the indC T-domain with the T-domain of bpsA. These are the 
combinations A1, A2 and C1. We applied combination A2 for further T-domain exchanges. ">Fig. 6</A>) and the T-domains of the NRPS modules plu2642 (<EM>P. luminescens</EM>) and delH (<EM>D. acidovorans</EM>)(<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/6e/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig9.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 7: Applying optimized domain border combinations by T-domain exchange of native NRPS T-domains&lt;/b&gt;
     As described above, we determined an optimized domain border combination for the exchange of the native indC T-domain with the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase bpsA. We applied this border combination (previously referred to as &lt;i&gt;A2&lt;/i&gt;) to the T-domains of the NRPS modules entF, delH4, delH5, tycA1, tycC6, plu2642 and plu2670, replacing the indC T-domain with the respective fragments of those modules. This figure shows three transformants with a blue phenotype in which the indC T-domain was exchanged by the T-domain of the respective NRPS module. The pictures were taken after 60 hours of incubation at room temperature. Once more one can see the differences in growth kinetics due to the production of indigoidine: Cells expressing the indC variant with the T-domain of bpsA  grow very slow and form small and dark blue colonies, whereas cells expressing other variants grow faster. Comparing the images on the very right, we suggest that cells expressing indC with the T-domain of plu2642 produce the most indigoidine in the given timeframe, compared to both the delH4- and the bpsA-variant. The combination of the plu2642 T-domain and the indC indigoidine synthetase seems to be ideal, concerning both indigoidine production and overall growth.">Fig. 7</A>). In order to quantify the amount of indigoidine produced by the engineered indigoidine synthetases when co-transformed with different PPTases, we established a quantitative indigoidine assay based on OD measurement using a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader, inspired by Myers et al. [15]. Notably, some of our engineered IndC constructs were more efficient in the production of indigoidine compared to the wild-type IndC (T-domains synT1, synT3, synT4; <A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/0/05/Heidelberg_heatmap.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 10: Combinations of Engineered Indigoidine Synthetases and PPTases differ in Efficiency.&lt;/b&gt;
E. coli TOP10 cells were co-transformed with engineered variants of the indigoidine synthetase indC and different PPTases. The x-axis depicts four variants of indC, in which the T-domain has been replaced (1: native indC; 2: indC with synthetic T-domain  1; 3: indC with synthetic T-domain 3; 4: indC with synthetic T-domain 4 (please find the Methods section for detailled informations on the synthetic T-domains) and a &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; negative control expressing an unfunctional indigoidine synthetase, in which a random sequence was inserted. The y-axis indicates four different PPTases we used (1: sfp from &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt;; 2: svp from &lt;i&gt;S. verticillus&lt;/i&gt;; 3: entD from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;; 4: delC from &lt;i&gt;D. acidovorans&lt;/i&gt;). The color of each field indicates the maximal relative amount of indigoidine production per cell density by cells expressing the respective indigoidine synthetase and PPTase.
Remarkably, when coexpressed with EntD, the engineered indigoidine synthetases with the synthetic T-domains 1, 3 and 4 result in higher indigoidine yield compared to the native indC. Moreover, the indigoidine synthetase with the synthetic T-domain 1 exhibbits the highest indigoidine production, when coexpressed with Sfp, EntD and without supplementary PPTase.">Fig. 10</A>).

This is particularly remarkable as our results contradict to previous studies of NRPS domains that reported the native T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase BpsA to be essential for protein function (and therefore not replaceable by other T-domains)[7].



In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to replace single domains from NRPS modules, while preserving or even enhancing their functionality. In addition, we established an approach for the design of synthetic T-domains and proved their functionality by introducing them into the indigoidine synthetase indC scaffold. Moreover, we established a high throughput protocol for circular polymerase extension cloning and transformation (Hi-CT) (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/RFCs#rfc99">BBF RFC 99</A>) based on CPEC assembly [13], which we applied for our domain shuffling approach. In summary, we created a library of 58 engineered indC variants. In addition we perforemd measurement of blue pigement production over time, which gave us novel insights in how NRPS domains should be designed, where the domain borders between different domains in a single NRPS module have to be set and which domains from respective NRPS pathways and bacterial strains can be used, when creating novel engineered NRPS pathways. We implemented our findings into the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Software">&quot;NRPS-Designer&quot; Software</A>, so that the underlying algorithm for NRPS design takes into consideration the abovementioned findings (e.g. domain border setting) which are certainly crucial for successful in silico prediction of functional NRPSs. Moreover, we modeled the indigoidine production of our constructs (please find more detailed information on our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Modelling/Ind_Production">Indigoidine Production Model Page</A>). The crystal structure of our optimized indigoidine synthetase, which is currently investigated by the group of Dr. Bange (Philipps-University Marburg), will give more insight into structural aspects of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis.
Thereby, our project pioneers the research on high-throughput methods for creation and optimization of synthetic NRPS modules composed of user-defined domains. We believe that our findings will highly contribute to future development of custom NRPSs.
</P><H2>Methods</H2><H3>Cloning Strategy</H3>
We assembled the different indC variants on a chloramphenicol resistance backbone (pSB1C3) with an IPTG-inducable lac-promoter, the ribosome binding site BBa_B0034 and the coding sequence of the respective indC variant. The indC plasmids should be co-transformed with a PPTase construct to get a significant and fast indigoidine production. Therefore, we used a second plasmid backbone carrying a kanamycin resistance (pSB3K3). We assembled five pSB3K3 derived plasmids, each carrying an expression cassette with an IPTG induceable lac-promotor, the BBa_B0029 ribosome binding site and the coding sequence of the respective PPTase (sfp, svp, entD, delC and ngrA).
We used <EM>E. coli</EM> TOP10 for co-transformations of the possible combination of the indC variants and all PPTase plasmids. 

<H3>Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning</H3><P>
Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) is a sequence-independent cloning method based on homologous recombination of double-strand DNA overlaps of vector and insert(s) (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/6c/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig3.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 11: Circular polymerase extension cloning: a sequence-independent, homologous recombination based cloning approach&lt;/b&gt;Insert and backbone fragments sharing overlapping regions at their ends are transferred into a single reaction set-up in molecular ratios determined by equation 1 (compare to 5.1.4). 2)  The insert/backbone reaction mixture is heat-denaturized and subsequently cooled down to 53Â°C to allow for annealing of the complementary overlaps.  3)  By polymerase chain reaction, the single strand hybrid-regions are filled up to double strands yielding circular, double-stranded molecules with nicks at overlapping regions. 4) Plasmids resulting from CPEC can be used directly for transformation.">Fig. 11</A>)(Quan 2008).

CPEC relies on a simple polymerase extension of the DNA fragments to be assembled. Crucial to this concept is the design of vector and insert fragments which must share overlapping regions at the ends (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/6c/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig3.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 11: Circular polymerase extension cloning: a sequence-independent, homologous recombination based cloning approach&lt;/b&gt;Insert and backbone fragments sharing overlapping regions at their ends are transferred into a single reaction set-up in molecular ratios determined by equation 1 (compare to 5.1.4). 2)  The insert/backbone reaction mixture is heat-denaturized and subsequently cooled down to 53Â°C to allow for annealing of the complementary overlaps.  3)  By polymerase chain reaction, the single strand hybrid-regions are filled up to double strands yielding circular, double-stranded molecules with nicks at overlapping regions. 4) Plasmids resulting from CPEC can be used directly for transformation.">Fig. 11 (1)</A>

In a single reaction set-up, insert DNA fragments and linear vector are heat denaturized and allowed to anneal at elevated temperature, resulting in specific hybridized insert-vector constructs (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/6c/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig3.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 11: Circular polymerase extension cloning: a sequence-independent, homologous recombination based cloning approach&lt;/b&gt;Insert and backbone fragments sharing overlapping regions at their ends are transferred into a single reaction set-up in molecular ratios determined by equation 1 (compare to 5.1.4). 2)  The insert/backbone reaction mixture is heat-denaturized and subsequently cooled down to 53Â°C to allow for annealing of the complementary overlaps.  3)  By polymerase chain reaction, the single strand hybrid-regions are filled up to double strands yielding circular, double-stranded molecules with nicks at overlapping regions. 4) Plasmids resulting from CPEC can be used directly for transformation.">Fig. 11 (2)</A>

Subsequently, the single-strand hybrid constructs are extended under PCR-elongation conditions (72 Â°C for 20 s/kbp of longest fragment) which yield completely assembled, double-stranded circular constructs (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/6c/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig3.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 11: Circular polymerase extension cloning: a sequence-independent, homologous recombination based cloning approach&lt;/b&gt;Insert and backbone fragments sharing overlapping regions at their ends are transferred into a single reaction set-up in molecular ratios determined by equation 1 (compare to 5.1.4). 2)  The insert/backbone reaction mixture is heat-denaturized and subsequently cooled down to 53Â°C to allow for annealing of the complementary overlaps.  3)  By polymerase chain reaction, the single strand hybrid-regions are filled up to double strands yielding circular, double-stranded molecules with nicks at overlapping regions. 4) Plasmids resulting from CPEC can be used directly for transformation.">Fig. 11 (3)</A>

CPEC was performed according to the following protocol:
The total mass of DNA used per CPEC reaction varied between 50 to 200 ng. The insert to backbone molar ratio was 3:1 for insert-backbone and 1:1 for insert-insert molar ratio. Conversion from mass concentration of fragments to molar concentration was done using the formula: cM = c*10^6/(n*660), where c is the measured oligonucleotide concentration [ng/Âµl], n is the number of dinucleotides of the fragment and cM is the resulting concentration [nM]. 

The final reaction volume was adjusted to 6 Âµl with polymerase master mix (PhusionÂ® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer, NEB #M0531S/L). The CPEC reaction was carried out under the following conditions:

After CPEC, 5 Âµl of of the reaction mixture were used for transformation. The remaining volume was used for quality check on a gel with small pockets (10 to 20 Âµl in volume).
</P><H3>Generation of cdB-indC Construct</H3><P>
To minimize the background colonies when exchanging the T-domain of the indigoidine synthetase we generated the ccdB-Ind plasmid  where we replaced the indC T-domain with the ccdB gene (Modul structure: AoxA-ccdb-TE) which kills <EM>E. coli</EM> TOP10 cells but not <EM>E. coli</EM> OneShot ccdB survival cells. Test-transformation in both <EM>E. coli</EM> TOP10 and the <EM>E. coli</EM> OneShot ccdB survival cells showed that background colonies could be eliminated by this strategy.
We used the ccdB-Ind for all further CPEC experiments aiming to swap T-domains. Primers for the backbone CPEC fragments were designed to facilitate the amplification of the entire ccdB-Ind plasmid while omitting the ccdB sequence. Assembly of the finale indigoidine synthase products with exchanged T-domain was achieved by CPEC as described or above or HiCT (<A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/RFCs#rfc99">RFC 99</A>).
</P><H3>Examination of T-domain Borders</H3><P>
We exchanged the T-domain of indC with the T-domain of bpsA and varied the size of the exchanged DNA sequence, thus examining several domain borders (Figure 5a). We used the CPEC assembly method and the indC-ccdB plasmid for this approach.
For the investigation of additional T-domains from less related NRPS modules, we selected the border combination A2 which was positive in the test with bpsA. We used the T-domains of the following genes:

All T-domains from the respective genomes were amplified using CPEC primers with a uniform 5â-end and a 3â-end specific for the respective gene. For the assembly of the hybrid-indigoidine synthetases by CPEC, the indC-ccdB construct was used.
</P><H3>Creation of Synthetic T-domains</H3><P>
All R scripts used in the following sections are based on R version R-3.0.1. 

Different assumptions about the evolutionary conservation of T-domains were examined: i) conservation of a specific module across different species, ii) conservation of T-domains across different modules for the same species, iii) conservation of T-domains across different species,  iv) conservation of similar modules across different species. According to these three assumptions, different libraries of homologous protein sequences were generated using ncbi protein BLAST (blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with standard parameters:

</P><OL><LI> query sequence: indC; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
</LI><LI> query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences within <EM>P. luminescens</EM></LI><LI> query sequence: indC T-domain; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction
</LI><LI> query sequences: indC, bpsA, entF, delH5 and tycC6; Search set: non-redundant protein sequences without organism restriction;
</LI></OL><P>
The 50 closest related protein sequences contained in each the library were subjected to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using clustalO (<A href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/</A>). with standard parameters for protein alignments. For library generation iv), each query sequence was BLASTed separately and the 50 best results of each query were combined i.e. a total of 250 sequences for the MSA. 

After library generation, the following three methods were employed to design different synthetic T-domains.
</P><H4>1. Consensus Method</H4><P>
Based on the  .clustal file obtained from the MSA of the homology libraries, a consensus sequence using the UGENE software (<A href="http://ugene.unipro.ru/">http://ugene.unipro.ru/</A>) with a threshold of 50% was created (i.e. if an amino acid appears in 50% or more of all sequences at a specific position it is considered as a consensus amino acid). For the creation of the synthetic T-domains, this consensus sequence was used to fill the gaps where there was no consensus amino acid with the original amino acid from the indC T-domain. By this approach, T-domains were generated which might deviate from the original sequence at positions with at least average conservation but coreespond to the original one if there is less conservation.  
</P><H4>2. Guided Random Method</H4><P>
In this approach, the multiple sequence alignments (MSA) generated by the consensus method was used. Implemented in R, a position-specific profile was generated which has the same length as the MSA and contains the rate at which amino acids occur at any given position of the sequence alignment. The synthetic T-domain is created by position-wise generation of the sequence where the probability of choosing an amino acid at a given position is determined by the rate in the profile.
</P><H4>3. Randomized Generation Method</H4><P>
For generation of synthetic sequences by the randomized generation method, every amino acid was assigned a score of 1 or 0, i.e. occuring at least ones or not at all at a given position in the MSA. In the subsequent generation of the synthetic T-domain sequence of the synthetic domain, any amino acid assigned 1 had the same likelihood of being chosen at this position.
Seven synthetic T-domains were designed based on differnt combinations of the homology libraries and sequence generation methods.

The color code is adapted from ClustalX: here, the amino acids are colored according to their chemical and structural properties.

When inserted into the indC indigoidine synthetase - thus replacing the native T-domain - four of the synthetic T-domains resulted in a functional enzyme producing the blue pigment indigoidine, namely synT1, synT3, synT4 and synT5.

After the generation of the T-domain amino acid sequences, the OPTIMIZER web-tool(<A href="http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/">http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/</A>) was used to obtain the corresponding DNA sequence [16]. <EM>E. coli</EM> K-12 was set as strain for codon optimization and <EM>most frequent</EM> was chosen as codon option. The generated DNA sequence was cured from internal RFC10 cutting sites and CPEC cloning overhang required for the T-domain swapping into the ccdb construct were introduced. The synthetic T-domains were ordered at IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa). In order to obtain sufficient amounts of DNA, the synthetic T-domains were amplified via PCR. IndC-hybrid constructs of the native IndC with exchange of the native T-domain by the synthetic variants were assembled using CPEC and the indC-ccdB construct as backbone. The synthetic T-domains were amplified for CPEC using the same primers as for the native indC T-domain.

96-well plates are prepared with 100 Âµl LB-medium/well containing appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol and kanamycin for the indigoidine and PPTase contrcuts, respectively) and each well is inoculated with single colonies (in duplicates) from plates positive for the co-tansformation experiments i.e. from plates with blue colonies. Two sets of negative controls are also inoculated on the plate: First, pure medium serving as the baseline for background correction for the OD measurements. Second, transformation controls accounting for potential differences in cell growth due to expression of proteins contained on the plasmids, i.e. the antibitotic resistance gene and IndC. In this set of controls, the plasmid used in co-transformation with the PPTase plasmid contains IndC-constructs carrying a randomly generated sequence instead of the T-domain.  A second 96 well plate was prepared with 180 Âµl LB-medium/well for the measurement itself. The 96-well plate containing the pre-cultures of the co-transformed colonies was inoculated for 24 hours at 37Â°C. Subsequently, 20 Âµl of the pre-culture was transferred to the measurement plate. The absorbance of the bacterial cultures was measured at wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 800 nm in intervals of 10 nm for each well every 30 min for 30 hours at 30Â°C in a Tecan infinite M200 plate reader. For the measurement plate, Greiner 96-well flat black plates with a clear lid were used.
</P><H4>2. Data Analysis</H4><P>
Detecting the amount of the NRP expressed by the bacterial host strain is desirable. By tagging the NRP with indigoidine, the amount of the fusion peptide can be determined by quantifying the amount of blue pigment present in the cells. As the amount of blue pigment is proportional to the amount of the NRP of interest, a method for the quantification of the blue pigment will yield information about the expression of the NRP. Quantification of the pure indigoidine pigment can be easily achieved by optical density (OD) measurements at its maximum wavelength of about 590 nm. In cellular culture, indigoidine quantification by OD measurements is impaired. Cellular density of liquid cultures is standardly measured as the optical density (OD) at a wave length of 600 nm, i. e.  the absorption peak of indigoidine interferes with the measurement of cell density at the preferred wave length (compare to <A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/64/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig5.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 13: Quantification of dye in cellular culture by OD measurements at robust and sensitive wavelengths. &lt;/b&gt;The contribution of the scattering by the cellular components at the sensitive wavelength, i.e. 590 nm for indigoidine has to be subtracted from the overall OD at this wavelength.

Thus, for measurement of NRP expression without time consuming a priori purification of the tagged-protein, a method to separate the cellular and pigment-derived contributions to the OD is required (compare to <A class="fancybox fancyGraphical" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/6/64/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig5.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 13: Quantification of dye in cellular culture by OD measurements at robust and sensitive wavelengths. &lt;/b&gt;The contribution of the scattering by the cellular components at the sensitive wavelength, i.e. 590 nm for indigoidine has to be subtracted from the overall OD at this wavelength.

The method of choice, as described by Myers et al. [15], requires the OD measurement of  cell culture at two distinct wavelengths: the robust wave length ODR and the sensitive wave length ODS.  The concentration of indigoidine will have to be deducted from measurements at ODS = 590 nm:
$$OD_{S,+P}$$
$$[Indigoidine]= OD_{S,+P}-OD_{S,-P}$$
with $OD_{S,+P}$ being the overall OD measurement and $OD_{S,-P}$ being the scattering contribution of the cellular components at the sensitive OD. 

The scattering contribution of the cellular compenents at $OD_S$ ($OD_{S,-P}$) can be calculated from the scattering contribution measured at the robust wave length according to the following formula: $OD_{S,-P}= \delta*OD_R$. The correction factor $\delta$ is be determined by measuring the OD of pure cellular culture without indigoidine at both the wavelength $[OD]_{S,-P}$ and $[OD]_R$ and calculating their ratio. 
Finally, the indigoidine production can be determined as
$$[Indigoidine]=OD_{S,+P}- \delta*OD_{R}$$

For the calculation of the cellular component when measuring indigoidine producing liquid cell cultures, OD measurement at 800 nm as robust wavelength is recommended. By the approach described above, quantitative observation of the indigoidine production in a liquid culture over time as well as the indigoidine production in relation to the cell growth can be conducted. 

Background correction i. e. the contribution of the culture medium to the OD measurement is achieved by subtracting the mean of pure culture medium replicates from all OD values measured (<A class="fancybox fancyGraphical fancybox_p_centered" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2013/7/75/Heidelberg_IndPD_Fig_multiplot.png" caption="&lt;b&gt;Figure 13: Multiplot Illustrating the Quantitative Indigoidine Assay Based on OD Measurement&lt;/b&gt;

The OD590/OD800 ratio of the liquid culture producing indigoidine (black dots) differs from the linear behaviour of the negative control due to the production of indigoidine, which disproportionally increases the absorption at 590 nm. The OD590/OD800 ratio of an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; negative color (red graph) shows to be constant. Therefore, a constant factor has been determined, allowing to calculate the OD590 by multiplying the OD800 of a liquid culture with that constant factor (see Quantitative Indigoidine Production Assay - 2.

The remaining OD590 only refers to the amount of indigoidine in the liquid culture. Note, that the amount of indigoidine over time shows a sigmoidal behaviour. After a maximal level, the indigoidine level drops again. In parallel, the absorption at 430 nm rises, due to the reduction of the pigment keto-indigoidine to its fluorescent leuco-form (data not shown).">Fig. 14</A>).
