=> Don't trust the BB, because between 3 and 4 Kb there is no band. Backbone will be send for sequencing
=> Repeat entire cloning again?
Amplification of Backbone pSB6A1-lacZ-mRFP
As discussed, we are going to use another backbone. It is already in the parts registry: pSB6A1 + BBa_J04450 from Spring distribution 2012 (plate 1, well K1).
Transformation in E. coli TOP10
Chemical transformation of 3 µl of the plasmid
Incubation on ice, 15 min
Heat shock 42°C, 40 s
Incubation on ice again
Resuspended in 500 µl LB Amp for 30 min
Centrifuged (120, 5,000 rpm), removal of supernatant
Plated on LB Amp plate
Incubation ON at 37°C
