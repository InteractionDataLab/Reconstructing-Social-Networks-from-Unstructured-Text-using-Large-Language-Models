Amplification of DelOP did not work
PCR will be repeated at a higher annealing temperature of 65°C to increase primer binding

Results:
Restriction digest did not work, amplicon was not cut and total amount of DNA was probably too low
Restriction digest will be repeated as soon as PCR of DelOP works reliable and reproducable with higher amounts of DNA

Results:
Amplification of DelOP did not work, neither with lower amount of template, nor with higher, furthermore the DMSO concentration did not influence the PCR for the given annealing temperature
PCR will be repeated with recently ordered new Primers which bind outside the intended template in the Del-Cluster of D. acidovorans SPH-1 in order to obtain a specific template suited for a nested PCR of DelOP with Primers FS_22 and FS_14l
