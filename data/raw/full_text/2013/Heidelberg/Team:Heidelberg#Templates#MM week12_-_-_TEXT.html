Colony-PCR of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR amplificate of pLF03 grown on Cm+IPTG, grown in liquid culture and then transferred to Cm+IPTG (marked 2) and grown in liquid culture with Cm+IPTG(1mM) with primers IK07+IK08. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: BAP1-pLF03 (control); lane 3: 1 µl of liquid culture.

BAP1 did not grow on Amp, BAP1-pKD46 did grow on Amp at 37°C => no discrimination between pLF03 and pKD46 possible
Taq might have problems amplifying 4.8 kb from genomic DNA => use Phusion Flash (primers IK07+IK08, 20 µl total volume, use 1 µl of liquid culture, old BioRad cycler):

control did not work -> repeat in new BioRad cycler (pick from plate)
same result

1.2 kb band with primers IK01+IK25 in control => makes no sense, repeat
same result
transfer BAP1-pLF03 to new Cm+IPTG plate, colony 2 to LB w/o antibiotics, grow at 37°c#
