a slight band can be observed at 18 Kb, but 5 Kb is much more amplified
A slight band can be observed at 18 Kb, but 5Kb is much more amplified.
=> By NCBI-Blast we found out that primer HM08 can also bind inside of DelH with 6 mismatches and the forward primer DN11 can also bind with 4 mismatches inside the DelH = possible explanation for 5 Kb.
=> Change the amplification conditions.

The test digest showed that the first fragment is cut, because the band is around 3.7 Kb, but the third and fourth lane on the gel picture show the complete non-digested fragment and on line 5 the  FS71-HM08 fragment is not visible.
=> check again the digests.

Electroporation of pHM04
10 µl H2O were added to 5 µl of the Gibson assembly mix. 1 µl and 14 µl were electroporated into electrocompetent DH10ß. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and streaked (10% vs. 90%) on LB Amp plates and stored ON at 37°C.
Colony-PCR Conditions CP.W18.B
14 colonies (#7 was left out) were picked and screened for correct integration of first DelH fragmenta s well as grown in 500 µl LB Amp.

Colonies 1, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 15 show positive band.
=>Of the 250 µl liquid culture, screening PCRs for the correct insertion of the last DelH fragment were performed. To the remaining 250 µl, 8 ml LB Amp were added. Colonies 1 and 3 did not grow and were excluded from further analysis.

The expected bands were not there. So the colony seems not to have the entire DelH-plasmid. .
