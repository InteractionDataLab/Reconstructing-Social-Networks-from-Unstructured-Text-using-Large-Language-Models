Results:
The amplification of FS_06 to FS_07 did not work. No bands were visible
The amplification of FS_21 to FS_07 led to several bands, but none of these was the intended product
The amplfication of FS_20 to FS_07 also led to several bands, one band at the right height was observed. Consequently the specificity of the PCR will be increased by a higher annealing temperature
