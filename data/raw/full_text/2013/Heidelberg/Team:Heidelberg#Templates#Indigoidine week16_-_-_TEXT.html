Preparation for T-Domain exchanges
We assemble pRB14, which is a version of pRB3, in which the T-Domain is exchanged by the whole insert of the pDONR vector. Since pRB13 grew on DH5alpha and TOP10 we hope that pRB14 won't. This vector will be used to exchange T-Domains and will be modified to get a version without the PPTase sfp and the cutting sites EcoRI and SpeI in indC. To check whether a successfully exchanged T-Domain can be activated by a defined PPTase, we build pSB2K3-derived plasmids with a single PPTase (sfp, svp, entD or delC) under control of the lac-Promotor and the RBS BBa_B0029.

pSB2K3 contains the 3'-part of the reversed Primer in an internal lac-Operator-structure, so the PCR product is just half of the backbone (2500 bp instead of 4800 bp). We will use the same primers but pSB3K3 of the 2013 spring distribution plate 5 well 5E; which is around 3000 bp.

Transforation according to standard protocol for chemical transformation
TOP10 with pRB15-18 (-> LB+Kan)
TOP10 with pRB15-18 and pMM64, respectively (-> LB+Kan+Amp)
TOP10 with pMM64 (-> LB+Amp)
OneShot with pRB14 (-> LB+Cm)
OneShot+pRB14: small colonies after 20 hours
TOP10+pRB15-18: colonies on all plates
TOP10+pMM64+pRB15-18: (almost) no colonies after 20 hours; hopefully due to indigoidine growth retardation
TOP10+pMM64 TraFo was efficient
We will perform PCR screening in triplicates of TOP10+pRB15-19 and OneShot+pRB14 to get a first impression on whether the assembly was successful.
Plasmid Validation
PCR Screening
We use forward primers of the insert and standard reversed primer VR to screen pRB14-18 in triplicates. We use iTaq DNA-polymerase in 20 ul PCR mix:

Test Transformation
OneShot and TOP10-sells have been transformed with pRB14. We expect OneShot cells to grow as usual and no colonies on TOP10. As a control group we transformed OneShot as well as TOP10 with pRB3.
pRB19
pRB19 is a pRB14-derived plasmid without the PPTase sfp. The genotype is pSB1C3-lacPromotor-BBa_B0034-indCdT(ccdB)

Smear -> Annealing temperatures in the touchdown-part were too high, so RB21 3' end couldn't bind properly.  Second run with milder conditions.

Transformation into OneShot Survival cells. Doing colony PCR for screening with primer KH9/VR which would give a fragment size of around 1.8 kbp: (Note: Throw picked colony 4 away since unintendently pooled 2 colonies in PCR tube). Used iTaq.

colony PCR for pRB19 and pRB21
Colony PCR for pRB19 gave a lot of unspecific bands, probably because of less stringent parameters. Oculutated 6 ml of TB+Cm with colony 2 for MP preparation.
Biobricks
The PPTases sfp, svp, entD and delC and the indigoidine synthetase indC will be prepared for submission to the registry. indC contains two RFC10-cutting site, that have been removed during the assembly of pRB22.
pRB21 series
pRB21 is a pSB1C3-plasmid with lacPromotor, BBa_B0034 and indC. After the first assembly, EcoRI and SpeI cutting sites in indC will be removed to yield pRB22. After cutting site removal, the native T-Domain will be exchanged with ccdB to yield pRB22. pRB23 has the same genotype as pRB20 but with two PCR steps less.

Colony PCR for pRB21 was unsuccessful (see gel picture ), try again with less strigent parameters and positive control: KH5/VR on MP pRB3, which should give an amplicon size of around 2 kbp.
