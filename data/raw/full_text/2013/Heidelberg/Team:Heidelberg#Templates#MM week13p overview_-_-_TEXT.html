Goal
Vector map of the pIK1 plasmid .
Vector map of the pIK2 plasmid .
Back-up plan in case the genomic integration does not work. Two plasmids are to be constructed, pIK1 (containing BBa_I746200, pccB-accA, and sfp) and pIK2 (containing pccB-accA and sfp) in the pSB3C5 backbone. 6 fragments are to be amplified:
