Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Indigoidine week5
From 2013.igem.org
We got two plasmids from the Fussenegger group at the ETH Zurich containing a codon optimized version of bpsA
(pMM64) and svp (pMM65), respectively, for expression in HEK 297-3 cells [Muller 2012]. The first goal is to
transform the plasmids into competent E. coli (Rosetta) and check functionality of the plasmids in our cells.
Indigoidine production with pMM-plasmids I (Ilia)
After Transformation cells are grown first on Amp medium and thereafter on Kan medium.
transform competent Rosetta with 225 ng pMM065 and 253.5 ng pMM064
plate on Amp plate
pick colonies from Amp plate, make liquid cultures in LB + Kan + IPTG(1 mM)
Evening: no growth in liquid culture => prepare ON culture in LB+Amp
Put ON culture in incubator
prepare competent Rosetta-pMM064 from ON culture
transform with 225 ng pMM065
plate on Kan+IPTG plate
no growth on Kan plate
Results and Discussion
There were no blue colonies. Transformation will be repeated and medium will be provided with both antibiotics.
