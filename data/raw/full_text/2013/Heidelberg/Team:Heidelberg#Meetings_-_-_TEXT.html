NRPS – Delfibactin project
by Ilia
1. delfibactin:
export from biocompartiments: unspecific outer membrane transporter (so delfibactin gets into medium)
synthesis: pathway known, e.coli strain for production (maybe not clone DelC)
2. NRPS: introduction
modular enzymes: 3 modular domains (together 110 kDa)
steps: adenylation, acylation, condensation
3. software: input
match amino acid to known A-domain substrates
recognize easy modification (in amino acids) for which substrate you need it
method: substructure based algorithm for searching and predicting substrate specifity
it works in a R-package
10 amino acids are important for the substrate specifity
4. biobrick library
there is no standard for the Biobricks of NRPS
GHB
by Flo and Nils
1. Jugend forscht: done a test (we do not understand how it works)
not reached the supervisor yet
she didn't win anything
detect it via Spectrometry
2. 3 ideas for integrating the receptor
artifiial membranes are not an option (you can't predict how the protein is located)
in vitro expression of GPCRs (takes too long)
Luciferase activity under directt ligand-dependent control of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
=> measurments possible (very sensitive: represses glowing a little bit, a bit more... but never completely) (integrate it is fast, but the mutagenesis takes a long time)
Artificial yeast-cells for sensing Insulin-level and producing/distribute the Insulin
by Flo
presentation of the idea and past igem projects regarding this theme
semipermeable biocapsules (with cells inside)
the cells (yeast , bacillus subtilis, e.coli... ) for producing insulin if it is necessary
there exists a famous lab for synthetic biology which works on insulin production
Software Project
by Julia, Konrad and Hanna
parameters for statistical analysis and how they correlate (like teammembers, advisors, organsims, score regarding a scoring funtion)
graphics: basically histograms
work for the next weeks
1. software project
look on the focus of the team!
better definition of the parameters
estimate the cost of an IGEM project (there exists something for the nature paper... just looking at the methods etc...)
already made something with these parameters
clustering for example, not only directed
software project should be finished before the lab phase: end of June/ July
2. Gold Project
working on this project: Nils, Ilia, Julia, Ralf, Hanna
find stuff we have to order and send Dominik an email => done!
talk to companies (interested, is it done already and how, are there established assays)
find succesful examples
3. general information
we have to register and then apply for the team. LogIn
send an email for getting the contact details (parameters which here already used)
Agenda for next meeting (29.04.2013 at 5 pm)
results of pilot project (delfibactin in the lab)
present a project plan (goals, time etc.)
update on the software project. How to proceed etc.
Structure and Project Proposal:
will be written in the Wiki
catchy pictures have to be placed into the part Motivation / State of the Art
Abstract has to be added
- hanger gold or NRPS? --> probably start with NRPS and outline gold-project as application
- depends on how many other teams choose gold-project
- gold into the project-title?
outlook/final statement has to be added
postpone costs, work on timeschedule
methods have to be described more precisely --> look for experimental protocols
what has to be formulated in the PP was written down in note form
deadline for motivation part: Wednesday, April 17th evening
general deadline: Monday, April 22nd evening
deadline schedule, material + costs, final part + abstract: Wednesday, April 24th evening
Cloningmethods
ask advisors for additional introduction to cloningmethods --> Nikos (Wednesday)
Laborplan Pre-project
prepare ACM (1,5L + 0,5L (mit Agar)) Phytogel(NOT with Agar)
reactivation solution (without agar)
0,5% agarose solution with ACM (maybe water) with 10mM AuCl3
purification
HP 20 resin-beads: the Delftibactin attaches to the resin
Methanol dissolves the Delftibactin, afterwards dry (rotary vacuum)
resuspend it (in 2ml)
Motivation for Proposal (discussed with Tim & Tinka)
central idea: NRPS (gold is the application)
Weighing not clear
start with gold
Structure: Application = Framework
Main part: relevance of NRPS
generally more elaborate (not too much details)
more numbers (tons of gld recycled)
more structure
why this pathway for gold precipitation and not another one
don't use might or may
softwareproject: how important is it for the gold?? why is it important??? judgement
Trends of IGEM: no NRPS so far, thus new project for IGEM -> helps students and scientist in finding trends, etc...
3. Podiums discussion 27.6.13
18.00 talk about synthetic biology
18.30 discussion
church, politics, scientists, NGOs(?) - 5 people
Prof. Tanner
first of all: make a concept with our goal
catering afterwards (sponsoring)
Cloning
BACs
amplify genes via PCR (Problem, same Codons for E.coli and D.acidovorans)
maybe not optimal codons
Synthesis is not possible
Biobrickstandard: separation in 1 Kb sequenzes
first plasmids with one protein each
then plasmids with multiple proteins
and another try with whole pathway (BAC)
now we need to find experts and ask them for help
Cloning Techniques/Strategies (Dominik)
BBa (BioBrick Standard)

Reserach on NRPS
AG Marahiel, Marburg --> Niels
AG Cryle, MPI Heidelberg --> Konrad
further planning
Sat. 4. May: primer Design meeting ("Giant Inserts in E. coli")
Gold
we were able to reproduce the paper --> images with gold
delftibactin purification didn't work by now --> try again
recapitulation of NRPS domains and modularity
domains that are essential: C: Condesantion, A: Adenylation, T: Thiolation
what has been done
simplification of synthases (smaller linkers) -> no negative effects
replacement of alanin to serene by changing domain
module extention
short de-novo NRPs
NRPS biobrick library
produce a library with different combinable NRPS-subunits
start with producing staphcillin (has already been done --> realistic to achieve)
Coloured NRP: indigoidine (Ralf)
we could prove the modularity of our NRPS-library by producing indigoidine
is a blue dye
synthesized from 2 gylcin molecules with a certain enzyme
there are only a few cutting sites in the required genes
Cosmide (Hanna)
insert size 50kbp
has got cos site --> in vitro packaging
has got only very few cutting sites (BamH1)
selection maker: ampicillin
check of digestion with 0.8% agarose gel
preparation with phenol/chloroform extraction
Phagemids & PACs (Flo)
Phagemids
you can infect cells with phages or by electroporation
10-20 kbp
high yield of DNA
E. coli have too be competent for F-Phages
DNA extraction via phages
PACs
p1 artificial chromosomes
hybrid system of plasmid and p1 phage replication
insert size 70-150 kbp
transformation using phages
isolation with kit possible (QIAGEN)
good transformation-rate but complex system
you have to be very careful working with phages --> easy contamination
BACs (Fanny)
Recombineering
well established system
150-350 kbp
low copy numbers
"lamda red recombination" using 3 viral genes: 5'-3' exonuclease, overhang binding protein, inhibitor of bacterial exonuclease
use of cassette with pos and neg selection marker
electroporation of gene of interest
cloning: cassette is brought into the BAC by homologous recombination --> also several times possible
there is a library of E. coli strains which already have the cassette
Gibson cloning (Nikos)
iGEM biobrick standard will be hard for us to realize --> delH
we will promote modularity with the NRPS library
for the gold project we will likely use gibson cloning
we will talk about primer design on saturday (4th May)
start PCR as soon as possible

Cloning
DelH (review of the work done so far)
primers were designed and ordered
DelH gene first try with plamsid backbone: pSB6A1
AraC Promoter, RBs, lacZ, low ori pMB1, amp-R
PacI and KpnI are not in DelH gene, thus used for ligation
DelA to P into single plasmid with about 26kbp: pSB4K5
lacI Promoter, RBs, mRFP1, low ori pSC101, Kan-R
Hanna's work so far: Top 10 E.coli
pSB4K5 with Insert
pSB6A1
AraC
lacZ
pSB1C3 with insert
Are supposed to be joined by cloning to complete backbones by Monday
Indigoidine
similar to DelH
pSB1C3
high ori 0034, lacI promoter, mRFP1, Cm-R
cloning with +TypeII RE (recognize sequence and then cut at site one nucleotide next to recognition site)
division into three fragments
ask Dominik:
how exactly does this strategy work?
when is this an appropriate strategy to use?
Is "PCR Ligation" also a good Method (seperate PCRs for fragments; primers have "overlapping tail" takend from next fragment; ligation of fragments in one single PCR")?
Important! What about Freiburg? are they willing to help us with Gibson Cloning?
Approach of the Next Few Weeks
What should be bought: ---> Konrad's list
divison into smaller groups dealing with the main topics of our projects:
Indigoidine (closed): Rald, Konrad, Nikos
Del H lab protocol/methods (closed) : Hanna, Fanny, Sophie
Del Rest (A to P) (closed) : Flo, Ilia, Nikos, Nils
NRPS : Tania, Joschua, Ilia
Software : Nils, Ilia, Konrad, Joschua, Hanna
Decisions Made
serial cloner should be our main software used for primer design etc.
Should use tool for oligo 2ndary structre prediction
http/mfold.rna.albany.edu
Should create common primer list; structure as in the following:
continous number, primer name, abbreviation (initials), sequence, details (if possible with a link to protocol used), creator, date, evaluation (e.g. worked, low yield ... )
Agenda for next meeting (13.05.2013 6 pm)
all groups meet up seperately and continue working
brief presentation on next meeting
next meeting (with Dominik)
progress report of individual groups and lab
prepping for upcoming big meeting
Next big meeting will be 15.5.2013
Breakfast
socializing =)
Catching Up on Lab Work (Hanna)
news on the lab work
present protocol
Gibson Cloning Primer Design (Nils)
presentation:
Backbone pSB1C3, lacI, RBS, mRFP1, Cm-R, pMB! ori
finding data for introduction of RBS-DelE (PacI and KpnI)
design of four primers
2 for backbone
2 for insert
go to parts registry, search pSB1C3
shows sequence and features --> get selected sequence
look at sequence in Serial Cloner
graphic map should show sequence and particular RE sites (bold names are unique sites, italic names are not existing sites)
look for cutting site that is not present in backbone nor insert/cassette
find cassette BBa_503495 sequence in parts registry (not standardized, not best example)
add cassette sequence to backbone sequence
show in graphic map
get DelE sequence (has a lot of PstI cutting sites, but EcoRI only a single site --> can be mutated)
Primer for adding RBS and cuttingssites between backbone and insert
If primer gets too large one can make two PCR steps
methyl specific cutting enzymes can digest backbone to separate the PCR amplified
Primer nomenclatur: Kürzel_Nummer:Protein_CuttingSite_fw/rev
Buffer of Restriction enzymes should be compatible
Forward primer protein: Overhang - cutting site e.g. PacI - RBS - 6bp (can be used to enhance specifity when taken from gDNA) - atg-Start of Protein - additional 22-27 bp for specificity (or smaller for big primers) - last one should be G/C, no repetitive G/C if possible
Reverse primer protein: Overhang - cutting site e.g. KpnI (reverse complementary in case of non palindromic enzymes) - reverse complementary end of protein
Primers should be same melting temperature / length
Watch out for first and second melting temperature and other reactions run in parallel!
Forward primer backbone: Overhang - cutting site e.g. KpnI - backbone specific sequence starting with RBS
Reverse primer backbone: Overhang - cutting site e.g. PacI - reverse complementary sequence of backbone until RBS
Fold DNA on mfold:
3' end should be accessible
5' end can be varied (overhang)
wobble base pairs can be replaced
change length of primer to reduce folding
target would be a folding free energy > -2
Run in silico PCR in serial cloner
target melting temperature between 60 and 70°C (if possible - not a critical parameter)
if you make mutagenesis the sequence is not complementary anymore!
Evaluate PCR chacks for complementary parts and gives product length
Annotation
Features of sequence in serial cloner
in gene bank files
Ribosomal binding sites (Konrad)
Current Plan:
add medium RBS for every part
RBS in Del Cluster
RBS from Data base in file (Mail Konrad)
We can see the direction of transcription according to the primers
Use of J5 for Gibson assembly (Nikos)
Parts in device editor all at once
Plasmid backbone
RBS
Several parts for Insert - every mutation is a single bp part
Define how tot obtain the part
most of the PCR amplified
other option would be digestion
RBS would be embedded in a primer
Choose none for very small parts since it will choose lowest cost strategy
Controls
Choose parameters
Choose Assembly meths
Result is Vector Editor
Can show restriction sites
Primer sequences in csv file
Gives you cloning strategy
Agenda for next meeting (13.05.2013 18:00)
One point per sub group
NRPS

Define agenda for 15.5.
Group picture
File:Protocol 09-05-2013.jpg
Breakfast!
NRPS subgroup (Julia, Philipp)
Possible cloning standards
Handing in biobricks only in pSB1C3 (RFC10 standard)
RFC25 (scar 6bp) standard because RFC10 scar (7 bp) causes frameshift
Parts to be cloned from Tyc
T domains either in front of E or in front of C --> cloning 1 per group
A and C as single domains and as couple in parallel
E domains and Thioesterase
Cutting sites
not in Tyc A/B/C SpeI, EcoRI, XbaI, NgoMIV
Tyc B NgOMIV in C domain, in T-C linker
Tyc C PStI in CIII domain, NotI in AIII domain
Indigoidine subgroup
Plasmid optimised for eucariotic cells
Impossible to clone it as RFC10
Use RFC21 instead -> compatible with Tyc?
first as whole part
Can be transformed wihtin in this week
primer design within this week
Cloning standard discussion
Gibson!!!
find good reason, concept for Gibson cloning
standard cloning techniques unfeasible
Further plan
Order all he plasmids and strains for permeable strain (BAP1  strain, red plasmid, FLP plasmid, template plasmid)
Indigoidine (Ralf) RFC 21 + check for other NRPS (Ilia) pathways
Modularity of Indigoidine RFC 21
in parallel check on Gibson assembly in Freiburg (Dominik)
get Backbones from Washington (Fanny)
Software subgroup (Konrad)
subgroups for data mining, data management, statistical analysis, front end
right now mainly building data management + concept for frontend and analysis
starting with NRPS software only makes sense as soon as NRPS gives any positive results
next one and a half weeks for being productive and then we decide for or against the project
Delftibactin subgroup
8 and 10 kb successfully amplified
digest tomorrow
Ligating AraC promotor this week
If cloning in E.coli doesn't work we skip Del or search for different organism (next week earliest)
definitely no restrictiton based cloning -> depending on Gibson cloning technique
Miscellaneous
Send EMail to registry: How to submit parts? , Promote system open for new standards. (Fanny)
We should find a plan B for Delftibactin!
in vitro parts expression, ex vivo delftibactin synthesis?
Agenda for next meeting (15.05.2013)
State of the lab (Hanna)
Further plan (Fanny)
Gibson approach (Flo, Nikos)
Enzymatic cloning and dependencies of NRPS and indigoidine (Nikos)
Software project deadlinev + plan (Julia, Philipp)
Budgetplanung (Prof. Eils)
State of the lab
backbones
psB4K5 for Del A-P is ready
psB6A1 for DelH not
psB1C3 for Indigoidine is ready
DelH
two parts via SalI (8 kb and 10 kb) successfully amplified
will be integrated into plasmid for electroporation in E. coli
Further plan
methylmalonyl-CoA-strain
K207-3 is not available
we get BAP1
Lambda-red plasmid
FLP plasmid
Template plasmid
DelH
Expression in E. coli end of may
Indigoidine and NRPS library
problems concerning RFC10
Gibson Info Freiburg required
Washington standard: contact Washington team! (Fanny?)
Gibson assembly
maybe method of choice
are there protocols or do we have to delelop standard protocols
small fragments could be a problem (PCP-domain)
develop Gibson RFC standard for NRPS library?
Gibson approach, Indigoidine and NRPS library
problems with RFC10 restriction sites and gene size
DelA-P Cloning strategy
leave out not necessary genes like DelC
five cluster fragments
use Gibson cloning
Dominik: mid of next week we will get further information
avoid too big PCR-constructs; 10 kb has been very difficult to amplify
Indigoidine
try plasmid, reproduction of paper
seperate domains (A, T, TE) and fuse again to proove modularity
maybe exchange domains with domains from other pathways
Müller Plasmid -> new problem of 11 restriction sites
How do we want to assemble NRPS modules in our project?
maybe Berkeley RFC21 standard because it works very good for our gene clusters
compatible with linkers
allows fusion protein
not accepted by iGEM registry
BglIII cannot be heat-inactivated
benign scar (GS)
Washington pGA
Gibson Assembly Toolkit
based on RFC21 backbone
standards...
mix and match domains not using biobrick standard but another strategy
it is too much work to get our parts conform to RFC10 and the NRPS-pathways are not realy compatible with RFC10 at all
after first experiments consider codon optimized synthesis for part submission
other NRPS not standardised, but propose a new standard
few characterized parts are of more value than a hundret useless ones
conclusion
why not omit RFC and start with Gibson at the first point
get expertise in Gibson cloning (read papers)
Hanna and Julia (TA) should try Gibson assembly together
Software
iGEM pulse
use scrapy (python) to get data from last years wikis -> MySQL (first subgroup)
develop parameters for iGEM oulse webpage (second subgroup)
First Deadline: May 24
detailed plan on data mining and parameter design
Second Deadline: End of June
valuable product
NRPS software
NRPS library software starting after proof of cencept in Indigoidine
predict required domains for input structure and propose cloning protocol
Budget
possible sponsors
Klaus Tschira as main sponsor
talk to other sponsors for small fundings (connections...)
university funding, helmholtz, biotech,
sponsorship benefits?
logos on Shirt, Website, presentation
Miscellaneous
reservation of lufthansa flights for Boston!
group tickets are cheaper
greater flexibility
book hotels/ guest houses in Lyon!
marketing will be done by professionals
They will need the project description with loads of random pictures (domains, gold, electronic waste, cash, ...)
will be there at the next meeting
Conclusion
start Indigoidine subproject with Gibson cloning (faster!)
take care about hotels, flight (Sophie)

Sponsoring
we have to write into the application what we want from the companies!
Slovenian Company
Prof. Eils met people of a Slovenian company, which focuses on transferring very big amounts of DNA (up to 200kb) from one kind of bacteria to another one
DelH Cloning
DelH colonies grown after 24 h (two big and one small colony)
No blue colonies
Anja will replace Fanny and Hannah in the lab until friday

Indigoidine
Probably received the right plasmids
results not as good as in paper (not as blue)
BAP1 + plasmid is stronger
Gibson cloning of activating gene and NRPS on one plasmid
Tomorrow miniprep on picked colonies
Suggestion: Check expression of ribosome binding site with mCherry-lac system
Genomic integration
Probably not enough DNA -> PCR with new primers
Colonies definitely negative
making fresh competent cells
Software

train to Lyon is booked, need to book the ride back on 15.7. (Monday)
Human Practice
Konrad offered to take care of the soil samples to send to the UK (?)
want to get some info on Streptomycces from them.
Fanny and bts take care of the discussion round
Financing, Karl Steinbruch Stiftung, Software Project
Anja: we need three people's CVs that have worked in Bioinfomatics and have more than 120 ECTS
they want to know about where we spent the money
max ammount is app. 830 €/month
dead line is 31.7.
Lab Update
Delftibactin
Del H
problems with 1B bands
new amplification worked
were digested and purified today
are going to be ligated tomorrow
Dominiks suggestion:
divide ligation after 1 hour into two, one is kept at -20°C the other is let continue over night at 4°C
pool both together and electroporate this batch
gibbson primers arrived today; this will be the new approach, if ligation is unsuccessful
parallel gibbson does not make sense, to expensive
---> gel is running right now and will influence decision on further proceeding
Del Rest
7-8 fragments of 32 are still missing
backbone has been amplified
Flo designed new primers
for DelOP
Indigoidine
pptase could be amplified, but not indigoidine synthetase
brainstorming
maybe the gene is not in this sub-species?
plamsid from UTAH arrived
want to write to other labs if they can send us the plasmid
there is a different Streptomyces (Stamm) that has this enzyme but need to finde the correct name
burocracy discussion.. MTA, Hauspost, Eils signature
primer strategy with BPSA
Tyrocidine
Stamm come from Marahije (?)
Glycerol stocks,colony PCRs
new strategy has be developed
ordering of primers by end of the week
Methyl-malonyl CoA
want genomic integration of substrate synthesis complex for DelF
got the insert from the USA
just need to amplify the insert with appropritate primers with some extra DNA
first tries didn't work
has several primers for accurate testing/screening
if integration worked only one resistance gene copy
gets fragment PLUS other bands of something else...
did electroporation and purification this week
some altered conditions
some good colonies
screening
NRPS
primary goals of the NRPS etc
NRPS are modulary
three domains, CA-T-optional
flexible linkers between domains
can be put into different orders
wetlab:
goal: library of physical DNA of single modules to be able to put into different orders
start with tyrocidine pathway
software:
tell what you want
has info on different pathways and domains
tells me how to ligate everything together etc
specifity is dependent on CA domain
look at what is most probable to work later
--> calculate evolutionary distance according to the taxon ids in the database
4 nodes:
b.brevis
e.coli.
p. aeruginosa
b.subtilis
Discussion about Linkers:
should they be standardized?
how should they look like?
domains are highly conserved among species and linkers are NOT conserved at all
Wiki-Design
responsible persons?? Anja, Tania
A brainstorming session would be good
we are sure that wwe want it simple but the motto philosopher stone
explain logo on the wiki
ideas
every project has ONE object from the logo
Höhlenmalerei was an idea
maybe two possible ways to get to the wiki
software NRPS
visualize an overview of project (structure)
what is already done?
what is to do?
linker discussion
there are more than 500 monomer
one module consists in different domains
Agenda for the next meeting (19.07.2013)
Organisation (Hanna)
cooperation with Freiburg (Sophie)
sponsoring
software-NRPS (Konrad & Software)
Lab-work
human practices (slight)
to do
wiki design
human practices
organisation of team:
list of protocol writers,
for every detail there has to be defined a responsible person
doodle for concept day
Organisation
Hanna is new in the team as an advisor and will support us during the project. We have to book hotel and train tickets for her.
Freiburg-Cooperation
Three Freiburg team mmbers have been to Heidelberg monday/tuesday for cooperation. We did a Gibson Assembly with their constructs and transformed e. coli via electroporation and chemical transformation. After having dinnner they left the next day.
Sponsoring
Klaus-Tschira-Stiftung supports us
eppendorf supports us with consumables and hardware to lend
NRPS-Software
plan for web-interface and software/database-structure
webinterface is ready to feed the database with details to single NRPSs; we will provide the software with about 10-20 NRPS pathways.
getting the single domains is time consuming. automatization?
-> tool to connect Pfam, clustalO and NCBI to automatically get domain borders for the databas!
Lab
delftibacin
DelH is amplified; cloning using gibson approach after reassemlby of backbone
Del-rest: single parts are missing
indigoidine
first Streptomyces strain didn't carry our gene of interest; new strain arrived today
construct with exchangeable PPTases (gibson or restriction)
tyrocidine
module shuffling to test concept of modularity
bacterial strain is there, primer will be there next week
almost no restriction sites for RFC25
milestones
DelH is few days in delay, backbone causes trouble
DelRest is somewhat in plan
Indigoidine is two weeks in delay but no other project part is influenced since we decided to start the tyrocidine part in parallel
Tyrocidine; few days in delay because of primer shipment
iGEM42; part time work is sufficient as expected
NRPS-library; milestones need to be set; until now in time
genomic integration; back-up strategy to clone the methylmalonyl-CoA-pathway on a plasmid to validate our delftibactin-e.coli-strain
human practise
panel discussion
life science lab, schools, essay on gold recovery
discuss with NGOs about gold recovery, ecology and economy
regional small jewelries, maybe for sponsoring
interaction with lab-art project in summer
publications in systembiologie.de, RNZ, Uni-Zeitung, ...
don't put too much time in human practise
next meeting
with supervisors: tuesday July 30th; 5.30 pm
General organisation stuff
Fridge should be defrosted -> does not close to well right now
Keep an eye on backup bottles of agarose, buffers, etc. and discard gel remains....
Handle ethidiumbromide with care and do use new gloves for touching other stuff as buffers for instance; close gel chambers; better communication and more chambers needed
Sign in to the cycler calendars
Mini prep: more efficient with 2 min lysis
Write on autolcavation stuff: who, content, date
Store autoclaved PCR tubes in the cupboard over the sink
General duties lab service: tips, autoclavation waste, generel order, plates of all resistances stored,  consumables -> Hanna will prepare a short to do list
Keep door to preparation room shut (noise)
Friday at 10 am weekly team meeting for general issues (advisor meeting on tuesday and thursday 8.30 am)
Further team building events (e.g. barbecues) should be planned
Karl-Steinbruch scholarship won't be pursued further; Additional discussion with Roland Eils at the next meeting
Dispute disagreements with other persons directly
Google calendars: keep lab times updated!
Plasmid cards: we need them of each subproject; Nomenclature: as primers only with 'p' prefix; ask others if you do not know how to prepare them
Do not forget the wiki documentation
Abstract, tracks etc. have to be submitted until beginning of august -> has to be communicated with Roland, too. Project titles, abstracts etc. can be changed until later deadline. => Hanna, Fanny and Tania will prepare some drafts.
Biosafety fonds -> Philipp
Design
Invite Lang & Pflanz again? Ask Roland.
T-shirts -> polo, embroidery, color: dark blue, black or light green, light blue -> proposals will be prepared by Tania for next meeting
wiki design:
different languages: german (all), english(all), italian (Barbara), portugese(Tania), russian(Ilia),  france (Philipp), spanish (Hanna), greek (Nikos), ukrain (Fanny), chinese (Philipp), japanese(Ralf),  vietnamese(Fanny), hebrew (Tania), klingon(Ilia), korean (Jin)
chart of colour range?
Tania and Anja present their Wiki layout proposals -> Web-implementation by Joshua and Nils when layout graphics design terminated
Human practices
- Art, panel discussion (synthetic foods), schools (are interested, Tania will talk to the teachers) (-> as backup)
Judging criteria
no dates online yet
we have to select three tracks -> which ones?
our favorites (until now):
- Manufacturing - foundational Advance - environment
project description can be adjusted until wiki freeze (but is no judging criteria): make it more lurid (abstract as well) and integrate synthetic biology better
Freiburg constructs
characterize constructs? => Help another Team criteria
but these are eucaryotic constructs
check on different cell lines, media and digests
critical because incubator could be contaminated by us -> disastrous for Di Ventura group
we have no cell culture -> send cell lines to Freiburg instead
we have to fulfill one of three gold medal requirements (Parts debugging, characterize other parts, essay on safety/environment/effects of proeject)
characterize SFP? Has not been submitted -> cannot do it -> re-submit pptases
essay backup solution
Plan for Tomorrow (Meeting with Roland Eils)
Milestones
Short lab update
Indigoidine [as a new reporter system; try all suggested T-domains; show benefits of software for Indigoidine project]
Software [set up criteria, which describe similarity of modules, e.g. by literature research, Nikos will ask a member of König group, who worked with t-domains, for help]
Tyrocidine [detection: Wombacher group; in-vitro/in-vivo in parallel; maybe his-tag?; HPLC before? -> enrichment of fragments; CPEC as alternative for Gibson (worked for Ralf); e. coli lysate (e.g. in-vitro translation); do some literature research on how other groups detected NRPs; non-proteinogenic amino acids for labeling; concentration gradients native <-> transformed; contact Mr. Lehmann]
Del H [wait for results (tomorrow)]
Del Rest [waiting for digestion results; Have all fragments, but F-G is too yet]
Software [meeting tomorrow before Eils meeting? Present our scheme of the last meeting + slides of subteams]
send all slides to Philipp until 3.30 p.m. tomorrow
Sponsoring
Böhringer Ingelheim sponsors us with 5.000 €
a Gold Smith from Heidelberg donates us 50 €
Wiki-Design & T-shirts
we decided to stich our logo on the shirts
color: navy
golden border around the logo with blue background
Lab update
Indigiodine
we have 3 constructs which work
now we want to find out which T-domains are the best to use for the NRPS library
we are going to clone indigoidine into igem-standard and characterize it
Tyrocidine
a few fragments don't have sufficient concentration --> optimization
amplification of some fragments didn't work
first gibson assembly will be done this week
talked to different people because of using their mass-spectrometry
DelH
changed the backbone
managed to create constructs, did the electroporation
there were no colonies growing on the plates
DelRest
were able to amplify all parts
started to validate fragments
start gibson as soon as we checked fragments
NRPS-Software
Database is more or less implemented
main programm is able to most of what it is supposed to
Webinterface has been started but doesn't comprise all features
connection Pfam works
Art Cooperation
maybe involving artists into our meeting
talk to them about our projects --> maybe they like some parts of our projects and we can collaborate
we could give them a insight into synthetic biology
we can think about offering some of the artists to stay with us during the period of the art project
