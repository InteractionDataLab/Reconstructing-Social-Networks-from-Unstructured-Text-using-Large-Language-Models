We want to assemble pKH1, which is a pSB1C3-derived plasmid containing pSB1C3-lacPromotor-BBa_B0034-bpsA(pMM64)-
BBa_B0034-svp(pMM65). Single fragments are amplified and cloned using a Gibson approach. We received Streptomyces lavendulae lavendulae since S. lavendulae ATCC11924 has been shown to carry bpsA
[Takahashi 2007].

CPEC approach
Two different approaches were used. In the first approach 3 fragments (backbone (pSB1C3 based), bpsA and svp) were
used for assembly while for the second approach 4 different fragments (Backbone, AOxA, T-TE, svp) were used (like
for the Gibson mix). The amount of used template was calculated for backbone : insert ratio of 1:1 and for insert
fragment ratio at equimolar amount.

The used cycler program was carried out similar to CPEC paper for multipart assembly but I forgot to note down the
exact parameters. (Shame on me...)
Transformation
into TOP10
4 plates (1:1 and 1:4 of Gibson mix; 1x of each CPEC mix)
Colony PCR
colony PCR of construct assembeled by Gibson; wanted amplicon   size is around 1 kbp

validation of transformed BAP1 with Fussenegger plasmids
fusion PCR
Gibson Assembly of bpsA + svp insert
PCR for colony validation
IPTG induction, titration
IPTG induction, titration RESULT
Fussenegger plasmids in BAP1 under various conditions. BAP1   without any Plasmid, BAP1 transformed only with the bpsA carrying plasmid pMM64 and BAP1 transformed with the bpsA   carrying plasmid pMM64 and svp carrying pMM65 were induced with four different IPTG concentration ranging from 100   µM to 10 mM at two different temperatures (18 °C and 24°C) for around 24 h.
CPEC and transformation
IPTG induction, titration RESULT
2 ml of samples from induction experiement from 2013-06-22 were   centrifugated down and then visually compared. Like it can be seen, indigoidine is exported into the supernatant.
Streptomyces cultivation (Ralf)
media for streptomyces culture
YEME medium (Kieser et al. 2000)
10 g Glucose
3 g Yeast extract
5 g Bacteriological Peptone (I used Pankreatic Digest of Casein)
3 g Malt Extract
340 g Sucrose
ad 1 L water
DSMZ medium 65 GYM streptomyces medium
4 g Glucose
4 g Yeast extract
10 g Malt extract
(2 g CaCO3 for plates)
(12 g Agar for plates)
ad 1 L water
Results and Discussion
BAP1+pMM64+pMM65 eventually produced indigoidine. We will now focus on assembling our own constructs starting with
pKH1. Streptomyces cultures look like yeast and have a strong smell as in the forest.
