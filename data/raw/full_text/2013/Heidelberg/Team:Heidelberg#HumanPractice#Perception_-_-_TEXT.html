Perception. Reflecting and Shaping Public Opinions.
Raising public interest in synthetic biology and one's project is crucial for the acceptance and thus fate of novel technologies. Media plays a special role in reflecting and shaping public opnions. In the following, we collected recent newspaper and online articles as well as blogs covering iGEM and our project in particular. Note that some of the articles are written in German as indicated.
