Characterization of DelH Plasmid pHM04 30-08 Clone 12
Maxiprep
1 ml of an ON culture DH10ß-DelH were inocculated in 200 ml LB Amp and cultured ON at 37°C.
Maxi prep was performed by upscaling of mini precipitation protocol.
Result
The maxi prep yielded 6x 180 µl.

Sequencing showed a mutation at the beginning of DelH
Next steps
=> Sequencing the other 3 positive colonies => hopefully one of them has no mutation at the beginning of DelH
=> Sequence D. acidovorans, maybe the organism SPH1 was not perfectly sequenced => amplify with FS35 & DN07
Characterization of DelH Plasmid pHM04 30-08 Clones 4, 6, 15
Sequencing
Miniprep performed
Send in for sequencing => no reliable result
Maxiprep performed => Clone 4: c= 5.51 µg/µl, Clone 6: c= 3.71µg/µl, Clone 15: c= 4.65 µg/µl
Send in for sequencing with DN07 again

Electroporation
Because the sequenced DelH colony 12 has a mutation at the beginning of the coding DNA, we are sequencing the other colonies and parallel we transformed with the rest of the same Gibson Mix (15 µl) used for the electroporation before (colonies 4, 6, 12, 15). In advance, we purified it via isoprop purification protocol.
Sample
Isoprop purified Gibson Mix
Colonies grown?
A
10 µl
yes
B

yes (a lot more than on sample A)
Colony-PCR conditions CP.W19.A
There were 30 colonies screened. 3 per tube and in total 10 colonies of sample A & 20 colonies of sample B

Sequencing of D. acidovorans
PCR Conditions DA.W19.A
For being sure that the mutation at the beginning of DelH is not some mistake in the sequenced genome we amplify this part with one primer binding the delG (FS35) and the screening primer binding at the beginning of DelH (DN07) and let it sequence with GATC.
