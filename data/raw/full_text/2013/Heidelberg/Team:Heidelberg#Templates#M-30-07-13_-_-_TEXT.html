Sponsoring
Böhringer Ingelheim sponsors us with 5.000 €
a Gold Smith from Heidelberg donates us 50 €
Wiki-Design & T-shirts
we decided to stich our logo on the shirts
color: navy
golden border around the logo with blue background
Lab update
Indigiodine
we have 3 constructs which work
now we want to find out which T-domains are the best to use for the NRPS library
we are going to clone indigoidine into igem-standard and characterize it
Tyrocidine
a few fragments don't have sufficient concentration --> optimization
amplification of some fragments didn't work
first gibson assembly will be done this week
talked to different people because of using their mass-spectrometry
DelH
changed the backbone
managed to create constructs, did the electroporation
there were no colonies growing on the plates
DelRest
were able to amplify all parts
started to validate fragments
start gibson as soon as we checked fragments
NRPS-Software
Database is more or less implemented
main programm is able to most of what it is supposed to
Webinterface has been started but doesn't comprise all features
connection Pfam works
Art Cooperation
maybe involving artists into our meeting
talk to them about our projects --> maybe they like some parts of our projects and we can collaborate
we could give them a insight into synthetic biology
we can think about offering some of the artists to stay with us during the period of the art project
