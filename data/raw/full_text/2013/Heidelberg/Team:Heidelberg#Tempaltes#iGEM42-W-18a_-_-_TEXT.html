Filters fixed
The drafts for most of the filtering functions had already been implemented, but ended up non-functional. This was due to data removal using empty vectors, which produces a severe error in R. Table 18.1 gives an overview of the different parameters and their basic filter design.

* Levels means all possible values the parameter can have.
The general code for filtering a numerical range parameter X using R after this update is displayed below (changes are displayed in red).
FilterForX <- function(data) {  if (input$FILX_min == ">max") data <- data[-which(data$X < max),] else if (input$FILX_max == ">max" & input$FilX_min != "min") data <- data[-which(data$X < input$FILX_min),]  else if (input$FILX_max == ">max" & input$FilX_min == "min") return(data) else data <- data[-which(data$X < input$FILX_min | data$X > input$X_max),]  return(data) }
The general code for filtering a single string parameter Y using R now looks like this:
FilterForY <- function(data) {  matchY <- rep(0, times=length(data$Y))  for (i in 1:length(input$FILY)) {   matchY[which(data$Y == input$FILY[i])] <- 1  } delete <- which(matchY == 0)  if (length(delete) != 0) data <- data[-delete,]  rm(delete) rm(matchY)  return(data) }
The code for matching the awards is slighly more complicated, since the awards are saved in the data-list and we want to reduce the data-frame. This is the pseudocode for the functions:
iterate through all awards to be included {  (re-)set a vector for deleting those items from the data-list  iterate through all the teams in the data-list {   if the award matches one of the team awards:   - expand the vector for the teams to keep with the name   - expand the vector for the teams already matched  }  delete those teams from the data-list, that were already positive in order to save runtime } reduce data-frame according to the matching result
All the filter functions and corresponding layout elements were put together in one file to easily copy and paste them to the different apps.
