To separate DNA fragments of different sizes, agarose flat-bed gels were casted in various concentrations (0.6% to 2% agarose in 0.5x TAE buffer). By applying an electrical field (10 to 20 V/cm), these gels were used for analytical or preparative separation. Therefore, the desired amount of agarose was boiled up in 0.5x TAE buffer until it was completely dissolved. After the solution cooled down to 50 to 60Â°C, it was poured into a flat-bed tray and ethidium bromide (EtBr) solution (0.5 Âµg/ml final concentration) was added. Finally, a comb was inserted to create pockets while solidification. The gel was put into the running buffer (0.5x TAE buffer) before the DNA mixture with loading buffer was loaded into the pockets and separated by electrophoresis. As ethidium bromide intercalates with the DNA (GC nucleotides) the resulting DNA-EtBr-complexes are visible under UV irradiation at 265 nm. As standard ladder for fragment sizes, 1kb+ ruler, 2-log ladder or 50 bp ladder were used.</DIV><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Gibson_assembly"> Gibson assembly </SPAN></H3><UL><LI><A href="/wiki/images/3/3a/Gibson_for_Heidelberg.xls" class="internal" title="Gibson for Heidelberg.xls">Excel template</A> kindly provided by the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/Coop" class="external text" rel="nofollow">iGEM Team Freiburg 2013</A></LI></UL><P>

For DNA extraction the QIAquickÂ® Gel Extraction Kit was used. Following the instrucion manual all necessary solutions have been prepared. The slices were weighted and accordingly Buffer QG added to the gel (for 1 slice 600 Î¼l; for 2 slices 900 Î¼l). The tubes with the mixture were incubated at 55Â°C until the gel slices had completely dissolved. In between samples were vortexed, if fragement sizes were not too large. Since the color of the solution never changed, no pH adjustments had to be done. In the next step isopropanol was added (for 1 slice 200 Î¼l; for 2 slices 300 Î¼l) to the sample and mixed. For each sample a QIAquick spin column was placed into the vacuum manifold and the sample decanted to it to bind DNA. Vacuum was applied until the whole sample has been drawn through the column. For further purification samples were washed with 500 Î¼l buffer QG and vacuum was applied. Afterwards 750 Î¼l Buffer PE were added to the samples, let stand for 2-5 minutes and vacuum applied. To remove residual wash buffer, the columns were placed into collection tubes and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). Finally, the columns were put into clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and 20-30 Î¼l water (55Â°C) were added to the center of the column. After letting the column stand for 1 minute it was centrifuged for 1 minute to collect the elute.</DIV><DIV style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">For larger DNA fragments, the QIAEX IIÂ® Gel Extraction Kit was used (suitable for 40 bp to 50 kbp). Solutions were prepared as advised in the instruction protocol. DNA bands were excised from the agarose gel with a clean and sharp scalpel and transfered to a microcentrifuge tube. After weighing the slices, buffer QX1 was added according to the DNA fragment size (6 volumes for &lt;100 bp; 3 volumes for 100 bp â 4 kb; 3 volumes with 2 volumes of water for &gt;4 kb). QIAEX II was vortexed for 30 seconds to resuspend the agent and added to the samples (10 Î¼l QIAEXII for â¤2 Î¼g DNA; 30 Î¼l for 2â10 Î¼g DNA; and an additional 30 Î¼l for each additional 10 Î¼g DNA). Subsequently the solution was mixed and incubated at 50Â°C for 10 min to solubilize the agarose and bind the DNA. Since we mainly used this kit for larger fragments, the resuspended pellet was only inverted and flicked to avoid shearing forces. We did not observe changes in color, that is why no pH adjustment were done. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant carefully removed with a pipet. The pellet was washed with 500 Î¼l buffer QX1 to remove residual agarose contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and all supernatant residues removed with a pipet. The pellets were washed twice with 500 Î¼l buffer PE to remove salt contaminants and resuspended by inverting and flicking. Then samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds and supernatant removed with a pipet. Pellets were air-dried for 10-15 minutes until they became white. To elute the DNA, 20 Î¼l of water were added and pellet resuspended by flicking. After incubation according to the DNA fragment size (5 minutes at room temperature (15â25Â°C) for â¤4 kb; 5 minutes at 50Â°C for 4â10 kb; 10 minutes at 50Â°C for &gt;10 kb), samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds.

For removal of excess nucleotides after enzymatic reactions, the QIAquickÂ® Nucleotide Removal Kit (QIAGEN) was used. All solutions were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten volumes of Buffer PNI were added to 1 volume of the sample and mixed. The QIAquick spin column was placed in a provided 2 ml collection tube and sample decanted to it. The tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 minute. Flow-through was discarded and the column placed back into the collection tube.

A MinElute column was put into a vacuum manifold and the sample was decanted to it for binding the DNA. Vacuum was applied until all liquid residues were drawn through the column. Afterwards 750 Î¼l buffer PE were added to wash the column and vacuum applied. Te remove residual wash buffer the QIAquick column was put into the provided 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). The MinElute column was placed into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20 ml water (55Â°C) were added toe the center to elute the DNA. After 1 minute incubation the tube containing the column was centrifuged for 1 minute.

Afterwards 250 Î¼l (procedure 2: 400 Î¼l) Buffer P2 were added and the tube inverted 4-6 times to mix the solution until it became clear. The sample was lysed for 2-3 minutes before adding 350 Î¼l (procedure 2: 300 Î¼l) buffer N3 and inverting the whole solution 4-6 times. Following the neutralization, the sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge. Supernatant was decanted to a QIAprep spin column and vacuum applied to the manifold until the solution was drawn through the column. To wash the column 500 Î¼l Buffer PB were added and again vacuum applied. In addition the QIAprep spin column was washed by adding 750 Î¼l Buffer PE and applying vacuum. To remove residual wash Buffer the column was transfered to a collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min. Finally, the column was put into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and 20-30 Î¼l water (heated up to 55Â°C) added to the center of the column.

For larger amounts of bacterial cultures the QIAGENÂ® Plasmid Plus Midi Kit was used to isolate plasmids. According to the instructions included, all necessary solutions were prepared and 25 ml bacterial culture harvested after 12-16 hours incubation. The sample was centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4Â°C and pelleted cells were completely resuspended in 2 ml Buffer P1. Then, 2 ml buffer P2 were added and mixed thoroughly by inverting until the lysate appeared viscous. The solution was incubated at room temperature (15â25Â°C) for 3 min. The QIAfilter Cartridge was placed into a new tube. Afterwards, 2 ml buffer S3 were added to the lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. The lysate was transfered to the cartridge and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. During incubation the QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column was put into the vacuum manifold and tube extenders inserted into each column. The plunger was inserted gently into the QIAfilter Cartridge and the lysate filtered into the tube. Thereafter, 2 ml buffer BB were added to the cleared lysate and mixed by inverting 4-6 times. Lysate was then transfered to a QIAGEN Plasmid Plus spin column on the vacuum manifold. Vacuum was applied until all liquid remains were drawn through the column. To wash the DNA 700 Î¼l buffer ETR was added and vacuum applied. Residual wash buffer was removed by centrifugation of the column at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The column was put into a clean 1.5 ml tube. Finally, 200 Î¼l water (55Â°C) was added to the center of the spin column.

Therefore we plan an experiment (one to two weeks), where we reproduce the results of the paper [&lt;bib id=&quot;pmid23377039&quot;/&gt;]. After mixing the Acidovorax complex medium (ACM) and adding 4g Chelex-100 resin / 1L ACM  we prepare 25 agarplates (0,5 L ) and two media for liquid culture (1L +0,5L). The second day is about the resuspending of the strain D. acidovorans in 5 ml [recepy in methods] and letting it grow over night. The next day 5 agarplates are inoculated with D. Acidovorans by fractional streak and 5 agarplates with streak over half of the plate. In addition to these 10 agarplates, also the two flasks with the liquid media are inoculated with the strain. The rest of the resuspended cells is stored in a glycerol stock. After 3 days of culture growth (shaking at 190rpm, at a temperature of 30Â°C) the cells are big enough to start with the delftibactin purification (liquid culture) and the fast test on the agarplates. For the fast test on the agarplates we prepare an soft agarose solution (0,5% agarose and 10mM AuCl3) and incubate every plate with 10 ml solution for two hours at rooms temperature. If delftibactin is present there can be observed a ring structure around the cells. </DIV><DIV style="font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;">For the purification of delftibactin, the liquid culture will be centrifugated at  7000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant will be treated with HP20 resin (20 g/L) and then shaken 2h at 220rpm. With the Buchner funnel filtration the resin will be collected and washed with 400 ml dH2O. Afterwards the resin is again washed with 400 ml methanol which will be evaporate under rotary vacuum. The leftover is resuspended in 2 ml of ddH2O:MeOH (1:1). The solution is added to a HPLC column and the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) is analysed in a mass spectroscopy facility. The mobile phase consists in 2%-14% acetonitrile and  98% water +5 mM (NH4)2CO3. 
<P>After the purification we plan to mix the purified delftibactin with different gold solution (AuCl3) concentrations (between 5mM and 20mM). After a 2h incubation a precipitation would be observed.
