Results:
A weak band was visible at the right height.
Band was cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extration Kit.
Concentration after gel extration was too low
Maybe increasing the temperature further will result in higher yield.

Results:
No band was visible on the gel.
The PCR conditions of the 09-07-2013 should be further optimized.

Results:
Bright bands were visible in both, the PCR with the short and the long primer.
The PCR with the short primers worked better than the one with the long primer.
Bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extration Kit.
Concentration after gel extraction with primer FS_11short=6ng/µl in 18µl
Concentration after gel extraction with primer FS_11long=4ng/µl in 18µl
