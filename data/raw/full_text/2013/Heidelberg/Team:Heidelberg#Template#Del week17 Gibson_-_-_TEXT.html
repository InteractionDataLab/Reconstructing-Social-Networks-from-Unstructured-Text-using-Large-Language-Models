Result:
Colony F26w was screened positive, as it shows the expected band at 1.4kbp, the others were screened negative
8 ml of colony D8w and colony D26w (pFSN-1) were midi-preped according to protocol 'Preparation of large plasmids'.

Results:
The screening was positive for clone D8w with both primer combinations.
Thus this clone contains the backbone pSB4K5, the genes DelA, DelB, DelC, DelD, DelE, DelF, DelL and at least a part of the gene DelG.
For colony F26w the screenings were negativ.
Restriction digest of pFSN (31.435 kbp)
Restriction digest of pFSN (19-08) with l2:EcoRI, l3:BamHI, l4:BglII (17-08); run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE)

Results:
All digests displayed the expected bands and thus were positive.
Therefore the pFSN plasmid is very likely our desired construct.

Sequencing
The construct pFSN was isolated from overnight culture using the 'Preparation of large plasmids' protocol.
Single read sequencing was carried out by GATC Biotech
obtained .abi files were analyzed with UniPro Ugene, part of sequence showing convenient chromatogram was chosen for alignment using ClustalOmega
Sequence-Files from GATC Biotech
Sequencing of pFSN-1 with Primer FS_13_short
Sequencing of pFSN-1 with Primer FS_22
Sequencing of pFSN-1 with Primer VFII
Sequencing of pFSN-1 with Primer VR
Alignments
Alignment for sequencing of pFSN with primer FS_13s_rv against the expected construct to validate sequence of DelOP
Alignement for sequencing of pFSN with primer FS_57_rv against the expected construct to validate the sequence for the overlap of DelOP to DelG
Alignement for sequencing of pFSN with primer FS_58_fw against the expected construct to validate the sequence for the overlap of DelOP to DelL
Alignement for sequencing of pFSN with primer FS_63_rv against the expected construct to validate the sequence for the overlap of DelL to mRFP
Alignement for sequencing of pFSN with primer VF2 against the expected construct to validate the sequence for the overlap of pSB4K5 to DelAF
Results:
Sequencing of the final construct pFSN for all internal Gibson sites validated the intended sequence
Sequence of mRFP shows mutations within the primer site, therefore it can be concluded that mRFP is not functional
Colonies of D8w will be further analyzed by FACs to investigate whether mRFP is functional or not
Additionaly, SDS-page of clone D8w will be conducted to check for expression of the inserted Del genes
Concluding the results of colony PCRs, restriction digests and sequencing it can be concluded, that we successfully amplified 28 kbp of genomic DNA from our donator organism Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 distributed from the DSMZ, ligated the thereby obtained 6 fragments including the standard biobrick backbone pSB4K5 sucessfully in the intended order and consequently transformed a plasmid of 32 kbp in total into E. Coli using electroporation

Another 8 ml of colony D8w (pFSN-1) were midi-preped according to protocol 'Preparation of large plasmids'.
