Gel electrophoresis of the pLF03 digestion. Left: NEB 2 log DNA ladder; middle: digestion with EcoRI, right: digestion with XhoI+NdeI
need to verify plasmid identity: digest pLF03 with EcoRI (for linearization) and XhoI+NdeI (verify insert size); 388 ng (4 µl of miniPrep from 2013-06-04) each
insert only 3.3 kb in length, expected >4 kb ( AccA1 : 590AS * 3 = 1770 bp, PccB : 530AS * 3 = 1590 bp, CatR : 219 AS = 657 bp; adds up to 4017 bp, not counting RBS and spacers between the individual genes)
contacted Lei Fang (Pfeifer Lab), there are NdeI and EcoRI sites in catR (they were not indicated in his plasmid map)
to verify presence of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in insert: transform BAP1 with 97 ng pLF03 (1 µl of miniPrep from 2013-06-04), plate on Amp + IPTG
evening: pick BAP1-pLF03 colonies, transfer to Cm + IPTG
inoculate 4 and 5 ml of liquid culture (Amp) with BAP1-pLF03

Gel electrophoresis of the PCR amplificate. Lane 1: NEB 2-log ladder; lane 2: PCR with Phusion Flash; lane 3: PCR with Taq at 43°C annealing temperature; lane 4: PCR with Taq at 41.5°C annealing temperature
BAP1-pLF03 grew on Cm + IPTG
try to optimize PCR:
run PCR of 5 ng pLF03 (1 µl 1:20 dilution of miniPrep from 2013-06-04) with primers ygfG21C1 and ygfG21C2 using Phusion Flash F548 polymerase (performed by Dominik):

prepare glycerol stock of BAP1-pLF03
make miniPreps of BAP1-pLF03 -> 21 ng / µl and 27 ng / µl in 27.5 µl
received just plated DH5α-pCP20 from Sourjik Lab, grow at 30°C
2013-06-12
purify Phusion Flash PCR product with Qiagen PCR purification kit -> 120 ng / µl in 27.5 µl
inoculate 2 x 5 ml LB + Amp with DH5α-pCP20, grow at 30°C
2013-06-13
miniPreps of DH5α-pCP20 -> 7.8 ng / µl and 14.6 ng / µl in 27.5 µl, respectively
low yield of miniPreps: inoculate 2 x 5 ml LB + Amp with DH5α-pCP20, grow at 30°C
2013-06-14
miniPreps of DH5α-pCP20 -> 25 ng / µl and 29 ng / µl in 27.5 µl, respectively
prepare glycerol stocks of DH5α-pCP20
to avoid electroporation with intact pLF03: add 10 µl of PCR amplificate (1.2 mg) on gel, perform gel extraction (QiaGen gel extraction kit) -> 3.2 ng / µl
add 240 ng (2 µl) raw PCR product to 100 µl electrocompetent BAP1-pKD46
add 16 ng (5 µl) gel-extracted PCR product to 100 µl electrocompetent BAP1-pKD46
electroporate 50 µl each, add to 1 ml SOC with 1 mM IPTG
shake at 300 rpm, 37°C for 1 h
spin cells down (3 min 10 000 rpm = 8000 g), decant supernatant (leave about 200 µl supernatant in eppendorf tube)
resuspend pellet, plate 100 µl on Cm-IPTG, leave rest at RT
grow at 37°C

Colony-PCR of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR amplificate of pLF03 grown on Cm+IPTG. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: negative control (BAP1-pLF03); rest: colony-PCRs from PCR-purified plate.
one colony on plate with gel-extracted PCR product
many colonies on plate with PCR-purified PCR product
pick colonies from plate with PCR-purified PCR product, run colony-PCR (Taq, 25 µl total volume) with primers IK01 and IK02 (expected product: 465 bp):

no product -> pick colony from gel-extracted plate, pick colonies from PCR-purified plate, run colony-PCR (Taq, 25 µl total volume) with primers IK01 and IK02:

no product -> 2 possibilities:
all colonies bear complete pLF03 plasmid (PCR was run with 5 ng template, DNA concentration in PCR product: 120 ng / µl, electroporated with 2 µl -> 1/6 ng pL03 vs. 240 ng amplificate)
PCR did not work
for colony from gel-extracted plate + 3 colonies from PCR-purified plate: add up to 3 ml medium, add IPTG (1 mM) + Cm, grow at 37°C
plate rest of bacteria electroporated with gel-extracted PCR product on Cm + IPTG

miniPrep of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR product from pLF03. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: miniPrep of colony electroporated with gel-extracted product; rest: miniPreps of colonies electroporated with PCR-purified product.
no colonies on gel-extracted plate
make miniPreps of ON cultures, run gel
pLF03: 9.2 kb, bands above 10 kb, bands smear, low intensity (applied all 30 µl of miniPrep to gel) -> fragments of genomic DNA?
=> PCR went wrong?
