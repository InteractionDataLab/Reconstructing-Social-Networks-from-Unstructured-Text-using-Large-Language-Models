Gibson backbone (pSB4K5)
The backbone pSB4K5 was also incubated with the Gibson mastermix. We will use this as one negative control in the electroporation to test the efficiency.

Colony PCRs
As a lot of colonies grew we screened if DelL and pSB4K5 are present.

Result:
None of the screened colonies led to the correct amplicon, therefore the correct assembly has not worked in any of the white colonies
screening will be repeated, with white colonies as template, as bacteria including the correct 32 kbp backbone might not be capable of expressing mRFP anymore due to the large insert between lac promotor and mRFP

Result:
Colony D8w shows expected amplicon of 1.5kbp
The other colonies were screened negative.
D8w will be transfered to liquid culture to repeat screening PCR as well as for further validation beeing screening for the other insert fragments as well as test restriction digest
Furthermore another electorporation will be carried out to yield more clones positive for screening with the Primers VR and FS_14, therefore the remaining 10µl of the Gibson assembly will be purified using isopropanol precipitation
Electroporation
We electroporated the Gibson assembly (15-08) again to increase the chance of a positive clone. We purified it by isopropanol purification.

Result:
colony D8w again showed the expected amplicon in the colony PCR and will therefore be further analyzed for the other fragments as well as restriction digested and partially sequenced as soon as screening primers arive
Furthermore colonies E16w and F25w are screened positive for the fragment DelL
