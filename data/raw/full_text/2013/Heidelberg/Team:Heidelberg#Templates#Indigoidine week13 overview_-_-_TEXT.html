Indigoidine Production – Testing PPTases
We wanted to test various PPTases on their functionality in activating the indigoidine synthetases indC and bpsA. The plasmids pRB3-10 represent all possible combinations of either indC or bpsA with the PPTases sfp, svp, svp (pMM65) or entD. We transformed E. coli TOP10 with all the plasmids.
All PPTases are capable of attaching the 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl residue to the apo-form of the indigoidine synthetases as was observed by the blue phenotype of transformed E. coli TOP10 cells. The main focus was now on exchanging the T-Domain of the indigoidine synthetase indC to further proof the concept of modularity in the field of NRPS domains. We can easily determine which engineered versions of indC remain functionality by screening for blue colonies.
