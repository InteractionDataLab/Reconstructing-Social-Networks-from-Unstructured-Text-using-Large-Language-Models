Triple Clone pIK2.6, DelH and DelH I 6B
Electroporation
We electroporated all three plasmids again into E. coli BL21 DE3. This time, we incubated them them for 3 full days.
Electroporation
Total amount of DNA [ng]
Ratio pIK8.6:
DelH:DelRest
pIK8.6-1(12 Kb)
DelH-I6B midi (23 Kb, 235.2 ng/µl)
DelRest (32 Kb, 2.4 µg/µl)

E. coli BL21 DE3 with plasmids pHM04 (I6B), pFSN (D8w) & pIK8.6
ACM
Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin
Inoculation of 10 ml of over night cultures of each sample
For DH10β with plasmids pHM04 (I6B), pFSN (D8w) & pIK8.6 no such culture was made
Growth at 30°C
For each culture 1 L of ACM media with antibiotics was inoculated with this pre-culture
1 L of ACM media with antibiotics was directly inoculated with 1 mL of a 3 hour culture DH10β with plasmids pHM04 (I6B), pFSN (D8w) & pIK8.6 which had originally been made from a clone which had been picked from the agar plate. The 1 L culture was started 3 hours later than the other cultures
Expression was induced in E. coli BL21 DE3 with 1 mM IPTG after 8 h of growth
Cultures were harvested after 64 hours of growth
Purification of Delftibactin
Centrifugation of cultures at 3750 rpm for 30 min
Retrieved supernatant
Added 20 g/L HP-20
Stirred at RT for 2 h
Filtration with Buchner funnel to retain HP-20
Washed with 400 ml dddH2O
Elution with 400 ml Methanol
Evaporated methanol with rotary evaporator
Resuspended in 2 ml 50 methanol : 50 ddH2O
MICRO-TOF
File:Heidelberg Microtof0925.pdf
Result
Only in the culture of D. acidovorans SPH-1 Delftibactin could be detected. The samples were negative for delftibactin. Apparently our triple clone does not produce delftibactin. However, this is not surprising, since the DelH clone I 6B harbors a mutation in the promoter region.
