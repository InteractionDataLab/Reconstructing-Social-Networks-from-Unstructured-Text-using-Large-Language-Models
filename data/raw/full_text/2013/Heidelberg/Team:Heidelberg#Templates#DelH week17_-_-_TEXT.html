Rather low yield. So we switched the strategy and try to increase the template of DelH by amplifying it in smaller and more fragments. Therefore, we used the following primers: FS64-FS71, HM08, DN07

For the miniprep, the cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min
The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl P1 + 400 µl P2 and incubated for 120
Afterwards, 300 µl S3 were added and transferred into a new 2 ml eppi and centrifuged 20 min at 13,000 rpm
1 ml isopropanol was added and the normal isoprop-ethanol-preipitation

Fig.17.5 colony PCR of Gibson assembled DelH-BB with mRFP (loaded 20 µL of PCR)
l1:
l3-12:show an unexpected fragment at ~ 3Kb
Gel shows unexpected fragments at ~3 Kb.
=> Clones are negative despite of latest results. Current strategy does not work out. Development new strategy.
New Gibson Strategy
Gibson Strategy without mRFP
Try a new construct without mRFP, so that we can exclude the red clones from the screening. Therefore we are going to use a new reverse primer for the Backbone which includes only the terminator of the mRFP, but not the mRFP. The primers for the Backbone are HM11 & HM17. The construct is named pHM04 and shown in week 16 were the idea was specified. For first approach pHM04, we will amplify the backbone without mRFP, avoiding backbone reassembly due to ribosome binding site homology. In the second strategy pHM05, we will additionally introduce a tetracycline resistance, to ensure integration of the insert.

Amplification of Tetracycline Fragment
Preparation of Tetraycline Medium
Weight 100 mg of tetracycline  and dissolve it in 10 ml ethanol = stock solution
Add 500 µl of stock solution in 100 ml LB and mix
Transformation of Tetrazyklin Backbone
For the new strategy we need a tetracycline resistance (length ~1.2 Kb) of the pSB1T3 Backbone (2013 Distribution, Plate 5, well 7A, insert: BBa_J04450) [1]
The primers are already designed and shown in the table above
With these primers, we amplify the tetracycline resistance and include an overlap to DelH end and the backbone pSB6A1 excluding the mRFP
For the transformation I incubated 10 min at room temperature the well 7A of plate 5 with 10 µl ddH2O

Fig.17.11 colony PCR of Gibson assembled DelH-BB with mRFP (loaded 20 µL of PCR)
l1:
l3-12:show an unexpected fragment at ~ 3Kb
Gel does not show expected bands.
=> Screen 10 minipreped colonies of the plate 5 and pick another 10 colonies of plate 1, 2, 3 and 6 (on plate 4 are no colonies).
Colony-PCR CP.W17.D
2 different screening are performed
PC = picked colony
