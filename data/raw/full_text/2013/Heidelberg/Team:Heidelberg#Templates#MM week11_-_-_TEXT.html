gel electrophoresis of PCR of pLF03 with primers IK07 and IK08 using Q5 polymerase. Product from one PCR tube was split to two neighboring lanes.
1 µl of gel-extracted PCR amplificate was loaded. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: amplificate extracted by Dominik, lane 3: amplificate extracted by Ilia
no colonies of BAP1 on Cm
repeat PCR of pLF03:
run 4 PCRs of 4 ng pLF03 (0.2 µl of 21 ng/µl miniPrep from 2013-06-11) with primers IK07 and IK08 using Q5 polymerase (50 µl total volume):

unspecific bands (also present in colony-PCR from 2013-07-10)
unspecific bands not present in BAP1-pLF03 PCR (control) and bottom lane 5 (satellite colonies) => not due to iTaq
assume: some amount of satellites was picked together with colonies from plates -> give band at 500 bp; partially amplified ygfG fragments prime integrated insert
do multiple sequence alignment of ygfG, pccB , accA1 , and catR using ClustalO => long enough stretches of partially identical sequences present
add 1mM IPTG to cultures with colonies from 1µl/10µl plate picked today (grew in 500 µl LB at 37°C for several hours), after 2h at 37°C: streak on Cm+IPTG
pick 10 colonies each from 1µl/10µl and 1µl/rest plates, transfer to new Cm+IPTG plate, grow at 37°C
pick 1 colony from 1µl/10µl plate, inoculate 1 ml LB + Cm + IPTG (1mM)

need to determine whether 1.2 kb band is specific: run gradient PCR of colony 2 (iTaq, 20 µl total volume) with primers IK05+IK06:

intensity of 1.2kb band decreases, intensity of 0.5 kb band (control) does not -> 1.2 kb band is unspecific product

transfer some of colony 2 on Amp (check for presence of pLF03 as a whole), grow at 37°C
transfer some of colony 2 to liquid culture: LB + Cm + IPTG (1mM), grow at 37°C

Colony-PCR of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR amplificate of pLF03 grown on Cm+IPTG, grown in liquid culture and then transferred to Cm+IPTG (marked 2) with primers IK07+IK08. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: BAP1-pLF03 (control); lane 3: colony-PCR
bacteria grew on Amp => 3 possibilities:
Amp plates not selective
bacteria have complete pLF03 plasmid
bacteria still have pKD46, although grown at 37°C
plate BAP1, BAP1-pKD46 on Amp, grow at 37°C
colony-PCR did not work for the control -> repeat with OneTaq (use 1 µl of liquid culture)
no amplificate for colony: possibly, Taq has problems amplifying 4.8 kb from genomic DNA
