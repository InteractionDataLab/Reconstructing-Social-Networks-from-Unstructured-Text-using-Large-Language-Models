Update of methods
The list of the methods was slightly updated and the clusters were removed, since they turned out to be not very intuitive. In order to find methods, that are actually mentioned in abstracts we went through those of teams who were successful in either the new application track, experimental measurement aproches and other practice associated directions. The updated list is displayed in table 22.1.
After rerunning the postprocessing of our data sets the top 10 methods list actually contained 10 methods of which many were newly added.
