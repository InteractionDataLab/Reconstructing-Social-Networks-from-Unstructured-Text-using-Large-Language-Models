Optimizing Growth Conditions of D.acidovorans and Evaluation of Endogenous Background Gold Precipitation
In order to optimize plates, growth time and incubation temperature of D.acidovorans as well as to evaluate of endogenous capability of possible target strains, various growth conditions and bacteria were tested.
On Agar Plate following 3 Day Incubation at 30°C
Media was chelex treated, agar added and autoclaved, before plates were poured.
On agar plates, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys as well as MG1655 and Bacillus subtilus were plated from liquid culture and grown for three days at 30 °C.
14.4 ml soft agar (0.5%) was mixed with gold chloride [100 g/l] as follows and 200 µl per quarter plate added:

Unfortunately, the streaked E.coli DH10ß were contaminated (obvious only on LB plates) and can threfore not be analyzed.
On ACM plates following 30°C incubation, D.acidovorans, B.circulans, E.coli BL21 DE3 as well as the negative control next to D.acidovorans, but not the one on plate B, showed immediate purple-black coloring indicating formation of gold nanoparticles at 5 mM gold chloride. At 2.5 mM, D.acidovorans and the neighbouring negative control as well as B.circulans showed some coloring. E.coli BL21 pLys and MG1655 only showed minor coloring at 5 mM. At lower concentrations, no gold precipitation was observed.
=> E.coli BL21 pLys and MG1655 are promissing candidates for expression since they show the least background activity.
=> Optimal gold chloride concentration lies between 2.5 and 5 mM.
=> Delftibactin can diffuse through agar.
On LB plates following 30°C incubation, none of the tested bacteria showed any reaction.
=> LB is not suitable for expression of NRPs.
=> What is missing in LB that does not allow metall precipitating activity?
On M9 plates following 30°C incubation (which were mistakenly autoclaved after addition of glucose), D.acidovorans hardly grew. At 5 mM and 2.5 mM gold chloride, there is heavy background activity on the negative controls. Additionally, B.circulans shows strong - D.acidovorans minor formation of nanoparticles.
=> M9 is not suitable for gold precipitation experiments.
On Agar Plate following 3 Day Incubation at RT
Media was chelex treated, agar added and autoclaved, before plates were poured.
On agar plates, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys as well as MG1655 and Bacillus subtilus were plated from liquid culture and grown for three days at RT.

Fig.6.2 Gold precipitation on M9 plates incubated for 3 days at RT: T= 0:10.
Fig.6.3 Gold precipitation on M9 plates incubated for 3 days at RT: T= 0:20.
Fig.6.4 Gold precipitation on M9 plates incubated for 3 days at RT: T= 1:00.
On ACM plates following RT incubation, D.acidovorans and the neighbouring negative control, B.circulans and E.coli MG1655 show minor immediate coloring at 5 mM. At lower concentrations, no activity can be observed.
=> There is less Delftibactin expression in D.acidovorans at lower temperatures.
=> E.coli BL21 pLys remains a promissing candidate for expression since they show the least background activity.
On LB plates following RT incubation, there is again nothing to see.
On M9 plates following RT incubation, there is again high background at negative controls as well as intermediate coloring for D.acidovorans and B.circulans.
We will therefore analyze gold precipitation capacities of supernatants of D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, BL21 DE3, BL21 pLys and MG1655 in ACM liquid medium following 48 and 72 h.
In ACM Medium following 2 Day Incubation at 30°C
In 5 ml ACM medium, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys as well as MG1655 and pure medium were inocculated and grown for two days at 30°C.
1 ml supernatant was mixed with gold chloride [100 g/l] as follows:
Final gold chloride
concentration [µg/ml]
Volume goldchloride
stock [µl]
0.6
6
Result
Following addition of gold chloride solution, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys showed rapid purple-black coloring indicating gold nanoparticle formation. They exceed the capacity of D.acidovorans, which showed gold precipitation slightly faster than E.coli MG1655. The ACM did not show any background activity.
We will extend the incubation time of the cultures further to evaluate differences, possibly due to accumulation of Delftibactin in the medium.

Result

Test if purified Delftibactin is able to precipitate gold. From left to right: ACM media, filtered supernatant D. acidovorans, purified Delftibactin
Test if purified Delftibactin (diluted 1:10 in H2O) is able to precipitate gold. From left to right: water, 1:10 ACM media, 1:10 supernatant D. acidovorans, 1:10 filtered supernatant D. acidovorans, 1:10 purified Delftibactin
Micro-TOF
The supernatant of a 24 h D. acidovorans SPH-1 culture was analysed before and after the purification procedure using a MICRO-TOF. As negative control unpurified ACM media was measured as well.
File:Heidelberg 20130911Malditof.pdf
Result
Delftibactin was clearly present in the purified supernatant of the D. acidovorans SPH-1 culture. In contrast it could not be detected in the ACM media or the supernatant which was not purified.
Triple Clone pIK8.6, DelH and DelH I 6B
Preparations
Electrocompetent E. coli DH10ß and BL21 DE3 were prepared as described .
Electroporation
We electroporated all three plasmids into E. coli DH10ß using pIK8.6. Although the DelH clone I 6B has a deletion in the ribosome binding site, we hope that we still get enough expression of DelH.

Inoculation of 10 ml of over night cultures of each sample
Growth at 30°C (Delftia acidovorans) and 37°C (E. coli DH10ß and E. coli DH10ß + plasmids pHM04 (I6B), pFSN (D8w) & pIK8.6)
For each culture, 500 ml of ACM media with antibiotics was inoculated with the pre-cultures
The cultures were grown for about 8 h.

Purification of Delftibactin

Resuspended in 2 ml 50 methanol : 50 ddH2O
MICRO-TOF
File:Heidelberg Microtof0913.pdf
Result
Apparently the purification of delftibactin did not work, as even in the positive control (D. acidovorans SPH-1) no delftibactin was detected. As the cultures were harvested after only a short time of growth it is suspected that maybe the production of delftibactin had not started yet. The next time the cultures should grow for longer.
