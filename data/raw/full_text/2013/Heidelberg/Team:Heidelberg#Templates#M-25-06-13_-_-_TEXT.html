DelH Cloning
DelH colonies grown after 24 h (two big and one small colony)
No blue colonies
Anja will replace Fanny and Hannah in the lab until friday
Suggestion: check on blue colonies only with easy backbone ligation
Indigoidine
Probably received the right plasmids
results not as good as in paper (not as blue)
BAP1 + plasmid is stronger
Gibson cloning of activating gene and NRPS on one plasmid
Tomorrow miniprep on picked colonies
Suggestion: Check expression of ribosome binding site with mCherry-lac system
Genomic integration
Probably not enough DNA -> PCR with new primers
Colonies definitely negative
making fresh competent cells
Software
Several deadlines for different components
Deadline 8.7.
text mining should work
currently working on components and putting them together
next meeting on 1.7. 19h at Julia
Miscellaneous
NRPS estimation of computational feasibility
Project proposal - lots of feedback -> will be finished tomorrow evening
NRPS library should maybe get some more space in proposal -> Philipp until tomorrow
If we lack time in the lab we have to pe prepared properly including all primers.
We should have an internal meeting before tuesday to discuss about motivation, time we want to spend.
Agenda for next meeting (2.7.2013 19h)
