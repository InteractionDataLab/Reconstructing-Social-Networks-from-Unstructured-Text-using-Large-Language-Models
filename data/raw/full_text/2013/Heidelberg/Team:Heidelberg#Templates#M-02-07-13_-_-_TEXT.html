new logos were presented to us by Kai
the majority and Prof. Eils of the team supported the 3. logo (which is more complex, represents modularity)
Kai continues to work on the logo (colors, animation)
iGEM42 & Website
Julia presented 3 proposals of possible websites
we should use one layout for all websites/wikis
Kai will send us his background from the logo-presentationns
Milestones
we went through all milestones with Prof. Eils
Thermocycler-problem
talk to the IPMB!
find a solution for next two weeks --> Tinka's lab (plan in advance and let her know!)
we will propably buy 1-2 new cyclers
Slovenian Company
talk to them for Del-transformation
Sponsoring
Steimbuch Stiftung (Software founding up to 10.000€) might be interesting
Prof. Eils: the timeline is pretty long
Claus Tschirra is most important
Fanny will send a corrected version of our project proposal to Prof. Eils
Human Practise
Stage discussion: on synthetic biology...

Prof. Eils: human practise is important! but we shouldn't overdo it
go into schools
