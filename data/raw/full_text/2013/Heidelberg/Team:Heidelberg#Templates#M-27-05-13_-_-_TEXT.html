Power Cut
Power was down for 10 min in Labs --> Lab Materials should still be fine.
Labupdate
DelH
DelH fragments are ready for ligation
LacZ, AraC --> Cut again and purified
Backbone --> New Backbone is being amplified in bacteria taken from stock
Plan: Purify, Digest and PCR of backbone (could then be ligated with DelH on wednesday)
Indigoidine
Transformation of SVP and Bps in individual E.coli succeeded
Plan: Get BL23C3 and cotransform both Plasmids
General
Partsregistry kit shipping: At the moment some problems with customs
Lab materials will be ordered tomorrow
To do:
Document glycerol stocks etc.
Nikos: Ask Silvan and Jan if we can have script for getting PCR-protocols of PCR machine
Hanna: Doodle for date for arranging everything in the lab
Symposium BMBF
27th of June
Human practice?
Poster has to be made --> don't put too much effort in it
Nils starts creating a poster
Who wants to go?: Hanna, Philipp, Nils, Fanny, Tania, maybe Konrad?
Software
Statistics
Script which gets data from databank to R is ready (uploaded on Github)
Next step: designing apps
Webdesign
rApache (Ilia) vs. Shiny (Nikos)
Cost analysis
Complete one is not feasible
Instead: Only analyse single methods (can be chosen by user, website returns protocols, costs, teams that have used the method)
Next step: Look for methods, which could be analysed
General
Which is our target group??
Connect iGEM pulse with our project (for example evaluate our team with it)
Sponsoring
Template mail for sponsoring is nearly ready
Template project proposal of Eils didn't arrive yet
