From 2013.igem.org

sequences arrived: File:PIK1.2-pIK2.2 seq 2013-08-12.zip
perform multiple sequence alignment against assumed sequences: pIK1.2 with VF2 , pIK1.2 with VR , pIK2.2 with VF2 , pIK2.2 with VR
pIK1.2 looks good
part of RBS missing in pIK2.2 -> makes no sense, as part of binding part of IK35, with which the backbone was amplified
send pIK2.6 to sequencing with primers VF2 and VR, also sequence pIK1.2 with primer IK25 to find out whether RBS is also missing there

prepare glycerol stock of TOP10-pIK1.2
