Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Indigoidine week6
From 2013.igem.org
Transformed Rosetta with pMM64 and pMM65 didn't show a blue phenotype. Transformation will be repeated.
Indigoidine production with pMM-plasmids II (Ilia)
one blue colony on plate
make ON culture in LB + Amp + Kan + IPTG(1 mM)
transform BAP1 with 169 ng pMM064, plate on LB+Amp+IPTG
ON culture opaque, but colorless
plate contains BAP1-pMM064 colonies, but colorless
prepare fresh IPTG
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp + Kan + IPTG(10 mM) with 1 ml from Rosetta-pMM064-pMM065 ON culture
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp + IPTG(10 mM) with BAP1-pMM064
ON cultures opaque, but colorless
according to <bib id="pmid23053349"/>, indigoidine is extremely unstable, they did not observe any color above
30°C
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp + Kan with 1 ml from Rosetta-pMM064-pMM065 ON culture
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp with 1 ml from BAP1-pMM064 ON culture
when cultures reach opaqueness: add 1 mM IPTG, shake at 25-28°C
liquid cultures opaque, but colorless
indigoidine extremely unstable, but incubator has transparent door, incubator room well lit
prepare Amp+IPTG plate, plate BAP1-pMM064 from ON culture, leave at RT in drawer -> dark
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp + Kan with 100 µl from Rosetta-pMM064-pMM065 ON culture
inoculate 5 ml LB + Amp with 100 µl from BAP1-pMM064 ON culture
when cultures reach opaqueness: add 1mM IPTG, wrap in tin foil (-> dark), shake at 25-28°C
no coloration of liquid cultures
white colonies on plate
Results and Discussion
Cells don't show a blue phenotype. We received the E. coli BAP1-strain which is commonly used for heterologuos
expression of NRPS. It carries sfp, a 4'-Phosphopanthetheinyl-Transferase from Bacillus subtilis to be able to
activate NRPS PCP-domains (i.e. T-Domains)[Pfeifer 2001]. Transformation with pMM64 (bpsA) should result in
indigoidine production since sfp was previously shown to activate indigoidine synthetases [Yu 2013].
