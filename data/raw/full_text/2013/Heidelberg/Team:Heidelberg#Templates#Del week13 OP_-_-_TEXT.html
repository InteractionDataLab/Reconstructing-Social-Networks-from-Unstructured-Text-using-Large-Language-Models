bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
DNA will be used for restriction digests to validate amplicon

Restriction digest of fragment FS_22 to FS_13s; 2.7 kb; 21-07-2013 with EcoRI-HF
Restriction digest of DelAE (FS_02 to FS_03 ;08.07), DelAF (FS_02 to FS_05; 04.07) and DelOP (FS_22 to FS_13short ;21.07) with EcoRI-HF and digest of DelG (FS_08 to FS_23 cut1 ;23.07) with BglII; run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE)

Results:
Restriction digest did not work, the amplified fragment was either not cut or the fragments are not visible due to a very small amount of DNA
Re-PCR will be repeated to obtain the higher amounts of DNA required for the restriction digest
