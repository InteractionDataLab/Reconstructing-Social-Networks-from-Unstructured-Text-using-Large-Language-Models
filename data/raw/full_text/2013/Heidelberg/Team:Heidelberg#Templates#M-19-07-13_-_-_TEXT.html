Organisation
Hanna is new in the team as an advisor and will support us during the project. We have to book hotel and train tickets for her.
Freiburg-Cooperation
Three Freiburg team mmbers have been to Heidelberg monday/tuesday for cooperation. We did a Gibson Assembly with their constructs and transformed e. coli via electroporation and chemical transformation. After having dinnner they left the next day.
Sponsoring
Klaus-Tschira-Stiftung supports us
eppendorf supports us with consumables and hardware to lend
NRPS-Software
plan for web-interface and software/database-structure
webinterface is ready to feed the database with details to single NRPSs; we will provide the software with about 10-20 NRPS pathways.
getting the single domains is time consuming. automatization?
-> tool to connect Pfam, clustalO and NCBI to automatically get domain borders for the databas!
Lab
delftibacin
DelH is amplified; cloning using gibson approach after reassemlby of backbone
Del-rest: single parts are missing
indigoidine
first Streptomyces strain didn't carry our gene of interest; new strain arrived today
construct with exchangeable PPTases (gibson or restriction)
tyrocidine
module shuffling to test concept of modularity
bacterial strain is there, primer will be there next week
almost no restriction sites for RFC25
milestones
DelH is few days in delay, backbone causes trouble
DelRest is somewhat in plan
Indigoidine is two weeks in delay but no other project part is influenced since we decided to start the tyrocidine part in parallel
Tyrocidine; few days in delay because of primer shipment
iGEM42; part time work is sufficient as expected
NRPS-library; milestones need to be set; until now in time
genomic integration; back-up strategy to clone the methylmalonyl-CoA-pathway on a plasmid to validate our delftibactin-e.coli-strain
human practise
panel discussion
life science lab, schools, essay on gold recovery
discuss with NGOs about gold recovery, ecology and economy
regional small jewelries, maybe for sponsoring
interaction with lab-art project in summer
publications in systembiologie.de, RNZ, Uni-Zeitung, ...
don't put too much time in human practise
next meeting
with supervisors: tuesday July 30th; 5.30 pm
