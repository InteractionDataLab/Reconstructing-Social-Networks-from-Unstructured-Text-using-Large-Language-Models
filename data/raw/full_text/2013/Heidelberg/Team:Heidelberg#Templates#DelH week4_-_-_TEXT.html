This means:
The chloramphenicol backbone has the right length.
The digested chloramphenicol backbone is also ok.
The digested fragment pSB6A1-AraC-lacZ (with PstI & EcoRI-HF) showed the 2 expected bands at 2,070 bp and 3,360 bp, but another band around ~4 Kb.
=> Something is not ok with this ligated construct and we have to start all over again.
