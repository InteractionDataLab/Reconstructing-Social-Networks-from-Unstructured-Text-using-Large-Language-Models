Favorite Parts. Now it is Your turn. Start working with NRPS!
BBa_K1152013 . IndC Blue Pigment Production Device.
The indigoidine synthetase IndC is a single-module NRPS
Catalyzes the formation of the blue pigment indigoidine by circularizing glutamine
Indigoidine is visible to the naked eye
Indigoidine production can easily be quantified photometrically and is thus an ideal reporter
In constrast to many other pigment production devices, IndC does not need any external substrate supply
BBa_K1152007 . The GFP for Non-Ribosomal Peptides.
Enables labeling of custom non-ribosomal peptides with a blue pigment in vivo (see Indigoidine-Tag page)
NRPS modules of choice are introduced in front of an engineered IndC module containing an additional C-domain for communication with the previous module
ccdB is replaced during cloning; close to 100 % cloning efficiency
Peptide production can be seen with the naked eye or quantified photometrically
Labelled peptides can easily be purified and characterized by thin-layer chromatography
Helper-construct for high-throughput cloning of custom NRPSs for production of synthetic peptides (see RFC 100 for details)
BBa_K1152009 . Highly-Efficient NRPS-activating PPTase.
Helper plasmid for efficient peptide production by engineered or natural NRPSs
Transfers a 4'-PPT residue from CoA to a conserved serine residue in the T-Domain of NRPS modules, thereby activating the NRPS module
Improves parts BBa_K802006 and BBa_K302010 which are PPTases that were present in the registry, but neither annotated nor characterized as such
BBa_K1152015 - 19 . A Collection of Synthetic Indigoidine Synthetases Engineered by T-domain Exchange of IndC.
T-domain is important for NRPS efficiency
IndC was used as scaffold and the native IndC T-domain was exchanged by different natural and synthetic T-domains
Differing in indigoidine production efficiency
BBa_K1152015 outperforms the native IndC ( BBa_K1152013 ) when combined with the Sfp or EntD PPTase (red square)
Collection can now be applied for tagging synthetic peptides produced by engineered NRPSs (see Indigoidine-Tag subproject)
