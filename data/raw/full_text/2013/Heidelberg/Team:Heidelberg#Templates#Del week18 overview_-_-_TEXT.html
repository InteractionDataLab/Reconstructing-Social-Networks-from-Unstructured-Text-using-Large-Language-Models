Validation of pFSN
This week we will analyze our positive D8w clone for expression of our pFSN plasmid. Therefore a SDS page will be carried out
Results
This week we carried out an SDS-PAGE with our clone D8w containing the pFSN plasmid. We used E.coli DH10ß as control. For our transformed E.coli a clear band at about 190 kDa was visible. This corresponds to the molecular weight of DelE (192,473 kDa). Consequently we showed that DelE is recombinantly expressed. Futhermore one could sense a very weak band at the height of about360 kDa. However this band could not be captured on an image. Consequently the samples have to be applied on a gel in a higher about again.
