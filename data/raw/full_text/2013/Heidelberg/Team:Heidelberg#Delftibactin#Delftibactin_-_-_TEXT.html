Week 1
We obtained D. acidovorans DSM-39 from the DSMZ and successfully reproduced the paper of Johnsson et al. D. acidovorans is capable to precipitate solid gold from gold chloride solution as purple-black nanoparticles. Already at low concentrations of gold chloride, gold nonaparticles are precipitated increasing with concentration of gold chloride in solution. In our experiments, precipitation on agar plates worked even better than described in the paper.
Week 3
We were able to dissolve gold-containing parts of an old CPU and established a protocol for recovery of gold as soluble gold salts from electronic waste. Moreover, we were able to show specific precipitation of solid gold by D. acidovorans from this "dissolved electronic waste".
Week 15
Using supernatants from the new Delftia acidovorans strain SPH-1, we showed precipitation of gold chloride solution to gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, we melted the purple-black nanoparticles to shiny solid gold.
Week 19
We optimized growth conditions of D. acidovorans and evaluated endogenous background precipitation of metall ions in the possible target E. coli strains E. coli DH10ß and BL21 DE3 following incubation over night on LB and ACM plates. Delftia acidovorans did not exceed E. coli, most probably due to insufficient cultivation time. When grown on LB plates, neither D. acidovorans nor E. coli showed any reactivity.
Week 20
We continued optimized growth conditions of D. acidovorans and testing various E. coli strains for their endogenous capability to precipitate gold in order to identify the strain with the least background to be used as target strain after 2 and 3 days as well as grown at 30°C and room temperature. A cultivation at 30°C for 3 days was identified as optimal. We also started to establish purification of Delftibactin using HP20 resins and successfully verified presence of Delftibactin in the supernatant of D. acidovorans SHP-1. Additionally, we proved precipitation of gold by the purified Delftibactin and detected it by Micro-TOF File:20130911Malditof.pdf. Moreover, we triple-electroporated the final DelRest construct, the final MMCoA plasmid and the first promissing DelH clone into E. coli DH10ß. The Micro-TOF has to be repeated again next week.
Week 21
We repeated last week's Micro-TOF of the first promossing triple-clone, which did not show detectable expression of Delftibactin.
Week 22
Possible E. coli target strains BL21 DE, DH10ß and NEB Turbo were analyzed for their background expression and indcibility. E. coli BL21 DE was identified as best of these three. It was electroporated with DelRest and pIK8.6 and of these, electrocompetent cells were prepared.
Week 23
E. coli BL21 DE + DelRest + pIK8.6 were elctroporated with the DelH clone C5, which harbors a amino acid substitution at the beginning of DelH. Its capability to precipitate gold from solution was analyzed on ACM plates following induction by IPTG. Due to a contamination, the results were inconclusive. The production of Delftibactin was accessed by Micro-TOF. The results were inconclusive, since the ''D. acidovorans'' positive control was negative, the experiment has to be repeated.

Gold Recovery from Electronic Waste
As test experiment, pins from an old CPU processor chip were dissolved.
Fig.0 Old motherboard from which we will recycle gold.
Step 1: Pins were mechanically removed and collected in a flask.
Fig.1.1 CPU from which pins will be removed.
Fig.1.2 Removed pins.
Step 2: Flask was put onto heating plate and covered in concentrated HCl.
Fig.2 Pins covered in HCl.
Step 3: HNO3 was carefully added to the pins and heated.
Fig.3 Evolution NO2 gas.
Step 4: After several minutes of moderate heating, pins dissolved completely. The solution turned green.
Fig.4 Green solution of dissolved pins.
Step 5: The solution was carefully neutralized to pH ~6 in a step-wise manner using first 5 M, later 0.5 M NaOH.
Step 6: This led to precipitation of copper salts, indicated by the milky green coloring.
Fig.6 Milky solution following neutralization.
Step 7: In order to remove the precipitates, the solution was filtered using a buechner funnel and sterile filtrated (0.2 µm).

Precipitation of Gold from Electronic Waste
Protocol
In order to evaluate optimial cultivation temperature of D. acidovorans, glycerol stock was streaked on ACM plates and incubated at RT, 30°C and 37°C ON. The next day, plates were covered with 200 µl 0.5% soft agar supplemented with 27 µl "dissolved electronic waste" solution.
Result
D. acidovorans showed intermediate, postponed purple-black coloring upon addition of "dissolved electronic waste" soft agar. Strongest coloring was observed on plates incubated at room temperature and 30°C. Delftibactin expression seems to be significantly decreased in D. acidovorans cultivated at 37°C. Reduced coloring further indicates lower gold ion concentration in the solution recovered compared to th ecommercially availible gold chloride solution [100 g/l]
We could therefore prove capability of D. acidovorans to specifically recover solid gold from dissolved electronic waste.

Optimizing Growth Conditions of D.acidovorans and Evaluation of Endogenous Background Gold Precipitation
In order to optimize plates for cultivation of D.acidovorans as well as to evaluate of endogenous capability of possible target strains, capability of D.acidovorans and E. coli DH10ß and BL21 DE3 grown on LB and ACM plates was tested.
On Agar Plate following ON Incubation at 30°C
On agar plates, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, and Bl21 were plated from liquid culture and grown ON at 30 °C.

Evaluation of Bacteria regarding Background Gold Precipitation on Agar Plate following ON Incubation at 30°C
ACM plate before incubation with gold chloride containing soft agar.
ACM plate after incubation with gold chloride containing soft agar counter-clockwise beginning from top left in concentrations of 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM.
All bacteria showed strong and immediate purple-black coloring indicating gold precipitation depending on gold chloride concentration. Regarding the precipitation of gold, there does not seem to be a significant advantage of D.acidivorans. In contrast to the paper from Johnston et al., we only grew them ON at 30°C rather than for 3 days. We will repeat the experiment using 3 day incubation time and also evaluate gold precipitation on additional media as well as by additional bacteria.

Unfortunately, the streaked E.coli DH10ß were contaminated (obvious only on LB plates) and can threfore not be analyzed.
On ACM plates following 30°C incubation, D.acidovorans, B.circulans, E.coli BL21 DE3 as well as the negative control next to D.acidovorans, but not the one on plate B, showed immediate purple-black coloring indicating formation of gold nanoparticles at 5 mM gold chloride. At 2.5 mM, D.acidovorans and the neighbouring negative control as well as B.circulans showed some coloring. E.coli BL21 pLys and MG1655 only showed minor coloring at 5 mM. At lower concentrations, no gold precipitation was observed.
=> E.coli BL21 pLys and MG1655 are promissing candidates for expression since they show the least background activity.
=> Optimal gold chloride concentration lies between 2.5 and 5 mM.
=> Delftibactin can diffuse through agar.
On LB plates following 30°C incubation, none of the tested bacteria showed any reaction.
=> LB is not suitable for expression of NRPs.
=> What is missing in LB that does not allow metall precipitating activity?
On M9 plates following 30°C incubation (which were mistakenly autoclaved after addition of glucose), D.acidovorans hardly grew. At 5 mM and 2.5 mM gold chloride, there is heavy background activity on the negative controls. Additionally, B.circulans shows strong - D.acidovorans minor formation of nanoparticles.
=> M9 is not suitable for gold precipitation experiments.
On Agar Plate following 3 Day Incubation at RT
Media was chelex treated, agar added and autoclaved, before plates were poured.
On agar plates, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys as well as MG1655 and Bacillus subtilus were plated from liquid culture and grown for three days at RT.

Fig.6.4 Gold precipitation on M9 plates incubated for 3 days at RT: T= 1:00.
On ACM plates following RT incubation, D.acidovorans and the neighbouring negative control, B.circulans and E.coli MG1655 show minor immediate coloring at 5 mM. At lower concentrations, no activity can be observed.
=> There is less Delftibactin expression in D.acidovorans at lower temperatures.
=> E.coli BL21 pLys remains a promissing candidate for expression since they show the least background activity.
On LB plates following RT incubation, there is again nothing to see.
On M9 plates following RT incubation, there is again high background at negative controls as well as intermediate coloring for D.acidovorans and B.circulans.
We will therefore analyze gold precipitation capacities of supernatants of D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, BL21 DE3, BL21 pLys and MG1655 in ACM liquid medium following 48 and 72 h.
In ACM Medium following 2 Day Incubation at 30°C
In 5 ml ACM medium, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys as well as MG1655 and pure medium were inocculated and grown for two days at 30°C.
1 ml supernatant was mixed with gold chloride [100 g/l] as follows:
Final gold chloride
concentration [µg/ml]
Volume goldchloride

Result
Following addition of gold chloride solution, E.coli DH10ß, Bl21 DE3, and BL21 pLys showed rapid purple-black coloring indicating gold nanoparticle formation. They exceed the capacity of D.acidovorans, which showed gold precipitation slightly faster than E.coli MG1655. The ACM did not show any background activity.
We will extend the incubation time of the cultures further to evaluate differences, possibly due to accumulation of Delftibactin in the medium.

Micro-TOF
The supernatant of a 24 h D. acidovorans SPH-1 culture was analysed before and after the purification procedure using a MICRO-TOF. As negative control unpurified ACM media was measured as well.
File:Heidelberg 20130911Malditof.pdf
Result
Delftibactin was clearly present in the purified supernatant of the D. acidovorans SPH-1 culture. In contrast it could not be detected in the ACM media or the supernatant which was not purified.
Triple Clone pIK8.6, DelH and DelH I 6B
Preparations
Electrocompetent E. coli DH10ß and BL21 DE3 were prepared as described .
Electroporation
We electroporated all three plasmids into E. coli DH10ß using pIK8.6. Although the DelH clone I 6B has a deletion in the ribosome binding site, we hope that we still get enough expression of DelH.

Result
Apparently the purification of delftibactin did not work, as even in the positive control (D. acidovorans SPH-1) no delftibactin was detected. As the cultures were harvested after only a short time of growth it is suspected that maybe the production of delftibactin had not started yet. The next time the cultures should grow for longer.

Result
Only in the culture of D. acidovorans SPH-1 Delftibactin could be detected. The samples were negative for delftibactin. Apparently our triple clone does not produce delftibactin. However, this is not surprising, since the DelH clone I 6B harbors a mutation in the promoter region.

Evaluation of Background Expression and Indcibility of Possible Target Strains
Electroporation of mRFP Controls
1 µl miniprpep DNA of the backbones pSB6A1 and pSB3C5 containing mRFP were elctroporated in E.coli Bl21 DE3. Cells were streaked on LB Amp + Chlor plates and stored at RT for two days.
Result
All plates were heavily overgrown. As discussed next, the obtained BL21 DE3 were actually BL21 DE3 pLys and therefore resitant to chloramphenicol. Electroporation has to be repeated, after real E. coli BL21 DE3 are obtained.
New BL21 DE3
We obtained new BL21 DE3 from the Russel Lab, which were obtained from NEB directly. Cells were inocculated in 10 ml LB and streaked on LB Chlor plates. The vial was frozen again at -80°C.
Electroporation of mRFP Controls
Real E. coli BL21 DE3, DH10ß and NEB Turbo were co-electroporated with 1 µl miniprpep DNA of the backbones pSB6A1 and pSB3C5 containing mRFP to check for leaky ecpression. Transformed bacteria were streaked on 2YT plates with Amp + Chlor and incubated ON at 30°C.
The next day, expression of mRFP on backbones pSB6A1 and pSB3C5 was induced by 50 µl 1 mM IPTG as well as inocculated in YT Amp + Chlor + 1 mM IPTG.
Result
After 6 h, only BL21 DE showed expression of mRFP. Yet, it was not restricted to the induced area. Another 10 h later, all strains showed red colonies with and without induction. E. coli BL21 DE3 showed least background expression and intermediate expression upon induction on plate and in liquid media.

Unexpectedly, the D.acidovorans control grew on the ACM + Amp + Chlor + Kan plates, indicating a contamination with triple resistant bacteria. Therefore, the experiment is inconclusive and has to be repeated. Moreover, the background control shows significant activity.
Nevertheless, there was neither increased activity of the induced 'E.coli BL21 DE3 containing DelH C5, DelRest and pIK8.6 compared to the E.coli BL21 DE3 negative control nor to the not induced control.
