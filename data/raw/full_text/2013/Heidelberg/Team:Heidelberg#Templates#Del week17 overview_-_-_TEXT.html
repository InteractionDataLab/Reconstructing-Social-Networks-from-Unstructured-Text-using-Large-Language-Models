Validation of pFSN
We screened for more colonies with pFSN but we didn't find any more positive clones.
Furthermore we did some tests for the validation of pFSN in colony D8w.

There is a mutation at the beginning of the mRFP cassette. This explains why the colonies do not get red. All other tests for valiation were positive. Consequently colony D8w includes the right plasmid. Because we cannot use mRFP as expression control we will do SDS-PAGE instead to prove that the proteins are expressed.
