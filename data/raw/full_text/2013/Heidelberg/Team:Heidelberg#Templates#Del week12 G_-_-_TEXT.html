Only a small band with conditions II was visible
There were no bands with the other two
Bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extration Kit.

Results:
Amplification of DelG did not work, no product was detectable
PCR will be repeated at higher temperature to decrease formation of secondary structures and thereby improve binding of primers to the desired sequence

Results:
Amplification of DelG was not sucessful, the Re-PCR did not yield the desired product
forward Primer will be reused but reverse primer changed, in order to obtain a shorter amplicon and another strategy for the Gibson Assembly
