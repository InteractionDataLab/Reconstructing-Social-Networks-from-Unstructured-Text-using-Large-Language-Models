3 3. Podiums discussion 27.6.13
3.1 Cloning
Laborplan Pre-project
prepare ACM (1,5L + 0,5L (mit Agar)) Phytogel(NOT with Agar)
reactivation solution (without agar)
0,5% agarose solution with ACM (maybe water) with 10mM AuCl3
purification
HP 20 resin-beads: the Delftibactin attaches to the resin
Methanol dissolves the Delftibactin, afterwards dry (rotary vacuum)
resuspend it (in 2ml)
Motivation for Proposal (discussed with Tim & Tinka)
central idea: NRPS (gold is the application)
Weighing not clear
start with gold
Structure: Application = Framework
Main part: relevance of NRPS
generally more elaborate (not too much details)
more numbers (tons of gld recycled)
more structure
why this pathway for gold precipitation and not another one
don't use might or may
softwareproject: how important is it for the gold?? why is it important??? judgement
Trends of IGEM: no NRPS so far, thus new project for IGEM -> helps students and scientist in finding trends, etc...
3. Podiums discussion 27.6.13
18.00 talk about synthetic biology
18.30 discussion
church, politics, scientists, NGOs(?) - 5 people
Prof. Tanner
first of all: make a concept with our goal
catering afterwards (sponsoring)
Cloning
BACs
amplify genes via PCR (Problem, same Codons for E.coli and D.acidovorans)
maybe not optimal codons
Synthesis is not possible
Biobrickstandard: separation in 1 Kb sequenzes
first plasmids with one protein each
then plasmids with multiple proteins
and another try with whole pathway (BAC)
now we need to find experts and ask them for help
