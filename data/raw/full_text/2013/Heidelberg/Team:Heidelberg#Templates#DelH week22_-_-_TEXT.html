Expected bands: 319 bp (HM22-VFII) and 395 bp (FS_66-SR_03)
Fig.22.1 Colony PCR for screening of DelH-pSB6A1 construct
10 ml of each colony were cultured.
The screening with primer FS_66 to SR_03 did not work. The positive control was negative.
The screening with primer VFII to HM22 was positive for 4 colonies (2,3,4,7,8,10)
These colonies have to be midi-preped and digested to test whether it is the original DelH or the mutated one

Apparently the mutagenesis did not work. The band was too low. Maybe recombination occured.
Sequencing
The Midiprep of clone 2 was send to sequencing to see what had happened during the mutagenesis.
Sequencing results for colony 2 with primer VFII after mutagenesis.
Result
The mutagenesis did not work. Apparently recombination occured. As the result was the same for all the colonies we suspect that repeating the mutagenesis would lead to the same result. Therefore the mutagenesis part is stopped.
SDS-PAGE of Clone C5
Lysis of Cells
1 ml over night cultures in LB of electrocompetent BL21-pLys and BL21-pLys with pHM04 (C5)
Meausured ODs (BL21-pLys = 1.33; BL21-pLys + pHM04= 1.03 )
Centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 10 min
Discarded supernatant
Resuspended cells in 133 µl (BL21-pLys) and 103 µl (BL21-pLys + pHM04) 1x loading buffer (40% ddH2O, 12.5% TrisHCl pH=7.5, 20% Glycerol (50%), 20% SDS (10%), 5% β-Mercaptoethanol, 2.5% Bromophenol blue)
Boiled samples for 10 min at 98°C
Electrophoresis
Applied 25 µl of each sample on SDS-polyacrylamide gel
Run at 100 V for 5 min and afterwards at 140 V for another 50 min
Staining and Destaining Procedure
Gel was stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1 h on shaker
Destaining with destaining buffer (50% ddH2O, 40% Methanol, 10% Acetic acid) until band were visible
Result
Fig.22.3: SDS page of DelH clone C5 in E. coli BL21 DE3
As shown in figure 22.3, there is a faint very high band, which is DelH (~600 kDa). Clone C5 expresses DelH despite of the amino acid substitution. Next, we will electroporate DelH C5 with DelRest and pIK8.6 in E. coli BL21 DE3 and analyze Delftibactin expression by Micro-TOF.

Contamination of Cells with Chloramphenicol Resistance
Preparation of Electrocompetent BL21 DE3
Electrocompetent BL21 DE3 were prepared according to the protocol . The following day, the LB Chlor plate was covered with colonies. Since BL21 are in contrast to BL21 pLys not ntaurally resistant to Chloramphenicol, they are obviously contaminated. In order to check whether this is also caused by an Indigoidine plasmid, extensive evaluation of stocks and transformed cells will be undertaken.
Test for Chloramphenicol Resistance
All stocks of competent cells were streaked on LB Chlor plates and incubated at 37°C ON.

Thus, the BL21 DE3 we obtained most probably are BL21 DE3 pLys, too.
New BL21 DE3
We obtained new BL21 DE3 from the Russel Lab, which were obtained from NEB directly. Cells were inocculated in 10 ml LB and streaked on LB Chlor plates. The vial was frozen again at -80°C.
Test for Indigoidine Contamination A
All competent cells as well as important transformed cells and recent mini preps of possible DelH plasmids were tested for contamination with an Indigoidine plasmid (which carries chloramphenicol resistance).

All stocks are clean, only the DelH minipreps as well as the one from pIK2.6 are positive for Indigoidine. Therefore, we identified the source of contamination for the triple clone, which turned blue. We however cannot explain the positive result for the DelH minipreps, which obviously harbour a second plasmid.
Test for Indigoidine Contamination B
Again, all minipreps which were send for sequencing as well as a positive control a negative control and two recently prepared minipreps from other teams were tested for an Indigoidine contamination

Surprisingly, all samples show Indigoidine band at ~540 bp. There is a contamination and we have to identify the source!
Test for Indigoidine Contamination C
Again, all minipreps which were send for sequencing as well as positive and negative controls and recently prepared minipreps from other teams were tested for an Indigoidine contamination. using two different primer pairs. Additionally, fake minipreps were performed to identify DNA contamination of buffers.
