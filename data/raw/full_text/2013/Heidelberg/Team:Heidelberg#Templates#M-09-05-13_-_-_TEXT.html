Catching Up on Lab Work (Hanna)
news on the lab work
present protocol
Gibson Cloning Primer Design (Nils)
presentation:
Backbone pSB1C3, lacI, RBS, mRFP1, Cm-R, pMB! ori
finding data for introduction of RBS-DelE (PacI and KpnI)
design of four primers
2 for backbone
2 for insert
go to parts registry, search pSB1C3
shows sequence and features --> get selected sequence
look at sequence in Serial Cloner
graphic map should show sequence and particular RE sites (bold names are unique sites, italic names are not existing sites)
look for cutting site that is not present in backbone nor insert/cassette
find cassette BBa_503495 sequence in parts registry (not standardized, not best example)
add cassette sequence to backbone sequence
show in graphic map
get DelE sequence (has a lot of PstI cutting sites, but EcoRI only a single site --> can be mutated)
Primer for adding RBS and cuttingssites between backbone and insert
If primer gets too large one can make two PCR steps
methyl specific cutting enzymes can digest backbone to separate the PCR amplified
Primer nomenclatur: Kürzel_Nummer:Protein_CuttingSite_fw/rev
Buffer of Restriction enzymes should be compatible
Forward primer protein: Overhang - cutting site e.g. PacI - RBS - 6bp (can be used to enhance specifity when taken from gDNA) - atg-Start of Protein - additional 22-27 bp for specificity (or smaller for big primers) - last one should be G/C, no repetitive G/C if possible
Reverse primer protein: Overhang - cutting site e.g. KpnI (reverse complementary in case of non palindromic enzymes) - reverse complementary end of protein
Primers should be same melting temperature / length
Watch out for first and second melting temperature and other reactions run in parallel!
Forward primer backbone: Overhang - cutting site e.g. KpnI - backbone specific sequence starting with RBS
Reverse primer backbone: Overhang - cutting site e.g. PacI - reverse complementary sequence of backbone until RBS
Fold DNA on mfold:
3' end should be accessible
5' end can be varied (overhang)
wobble base pairs can be replaced
change length of primer to reduce folding
target would be a folding free energy > -2
Run in silico PCR in serial cloner
target melting temperature between 60 and 70°C (if possible - not a critical parameter)
if you make mutagenesis the sequence is not complementary anymore!
Evaluate PCR chacks for complementary parts and gives product length
Annotation
Features of sequence in serial cloner
in gene bank files
Ribosomal binding sites (Konrad)
Current Plan:
add medium RBS for every part
RBS in Del Cluster
RBS from Data base in file (Mail Konrad)
We can see the direction of transcription according to the primers
Use of J5 for Gibson assembly (Nikos)
Parts in device editor all at once
Plasmid backbone
RBS
Several parts for Insert - every mutation is a single bp part
Define how tot obtain the part
most of the PCR amplified
other option would be digestion
RBS would be embedded in a primer
Choose none for very small parts since it will choose lowest cost strategy
Controls
Choose parameters
Choose Assembly meths
Result is Vector Editor
Can show restriction sites
Primer sequences in csv file
Gives you cloning strategy
Agenda for next meeting (13.05.2013 18:00)
One point per sub group
NRPS
Software
Del
Indi
Define agenda for 15.5.
