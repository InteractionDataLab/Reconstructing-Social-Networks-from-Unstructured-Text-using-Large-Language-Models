Indigoidine Production - bpsA
Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 was cultivated and used for amplification of the svp PPTase. We tried to extract bpsA from S. lavendulae DSM40708 with a new set of primers (Primer RB11-20).
PCR results with various primers and PCR conditions suggested that the bpsA indigoidine synthetase gene is not present or mutated in S. lavendulae DSM40708. The amplification of svp was successful.
Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii TT01 has been shown to carry an indioidine synthetase called indC (Brachmann 2012). We will use indC instead of bpsA for the following project parts.
