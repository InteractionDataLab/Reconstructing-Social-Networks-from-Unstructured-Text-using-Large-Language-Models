Reproduction of Johnsson et al. Paper
Aim
Reproduction of Johnsson et al. paper: Precipitating gold with D.acidovorans on agar plate, in culture, the medium of the culture and possibly purified delftibactin.
Preparations
Obtain D. acidovorans from DSMZ
Prapare ACM medium as described
Prepare ACM agar plates
Gold Precipitation on ACM Plates
Culture D. acidovorans for 3 days on agar plates at 30°C
Overlay agar plates with 0.2% HAuCl4 in 0.5 % soft agarose
Result
ACM agar plate with D. acidovorans (left) overlaid with 0.2% HAuCl4 in 0.5% agarose
ACM agar plate with D. acidovorans (left) overlaid with 0.2% HAuCl4 in 0.5% agarose
Gold precipitation on ACM agar plate worked even better than described in paper
Gold Precipitation in D. acidovorans Supernatants
Culture D. acidovorans for 3 days in ACM plates
Centrifuge bacteria in liquid culture (10 min 6,000 rpm)
Add 0.2% HAuCl4 to supernatant and medium control
Result
D. acidovorans Supernatant (top) and ACM negative control (bottom) with (left to right) 600µl, 400µl, 200µl, 100µl, 50µl, 0µl 0.2% HAuCl4. Far right: top: uncentrifuged solution culture with 600µl 0.2% HAuCl4, bottom: ACM with 600µl HAuCl4
The supernatant/ medium with gold was centrifuged after 2 h reaction time. left to right: supernatant with 600µl 0.2% HAuCl4, ACM with 600µl 0.2% HAuCl4, supernatant with 400µl 0.2% HAuCl4, ACM with 400µl 0.2% HAuCl4, supernatant with 200µl 0.2% HAuCl4, ACM with 200µl 0.2% HAuCl4
Gold precipitation with D. acidovorans supernatant worked well
Gold Precipitation in D. acidovorans Supernatants at different Gold Chloride Concentrations
Culture D. acidovorans for 3 days in ACM plates
Centrifuge bacteria in liquid culture (10 min 6,000 rpm)
Add HAuCl4 to supernatant and medium control
Result
Sequences of movie showing gold precipitation in D. acidovorans supernatant using gold concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.55 µg/ml
Gold precipitation with supernatant worked at very low concentration Gold
Gold precipitation with unpurified culture worked as well
