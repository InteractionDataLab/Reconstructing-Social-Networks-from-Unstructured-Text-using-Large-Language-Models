Sequencing Results
We send the following samples (amplified fragments of D. acidovorans DSM-39 and backbone pSB4K5 from the partsregistry) to GATC for sequencing:
AE (FS_02-FS_03) with Primer FS_02
AE (FS_02-FS_03) with Primer FS_03
Alignment of DelAE(FS_02 to FS_03) with Primer FS_02

Results:
Amplification of DelAE was repeated successfully with the new strain SPH-1
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
if fragment is used in Gibson assembly the amplification has to be repeated to increase the amount of product
