Results:
Amplification of DelOP did not work
PCR will be repeated with different primer concentrations to estimate whether primer dimes might be the reason for insufficient amplification

Results:
Amplification of DelOP resulted in a small band atthe desired lenght, but also a smear and several unexpected bands
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
amplicon will be used for restriction digest to validate the construct

Results:
Amplification of DelOP led to a band of the desired size as well as a smear and several different sideproducts
Band was cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit to be restriction digested for validation of the PCR product
Amplification will be repeated at lower temperature to obtain more product
