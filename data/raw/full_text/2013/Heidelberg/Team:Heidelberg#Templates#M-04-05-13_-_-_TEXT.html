1 Cloning
2 Approach of the Next Few Weeks
3 Decisions Made
4 Agenda for next meeting (13.05.2013 6 pm)
Cloning
DelH (review of the work done so far)
primers were designed and ordered
DelH gene first try with plamsid backbone: pSB6A1
AraC Promoter, RBs, lacZ, low ori pMB1, amp-R
PacI and KpnI are not in DelH gene, thus used for ligation
DelA to P into single plasmid with about 26kbp: pSB4K5
lacI Promoter, RBs, mRFP1, low ori pSC101, Kan-R
Hanna's work so far: Top 10 E.coli
pSB4K5 with Insert
pSB6A1
AraC
lacZ
pSB1C3 with insert
Are supposed to be joined by cloning to complete backbones by Monday
Indigoidine
similar to DelH
pSB1C3
high ori 0034, lacI promoter, mRFP1, Cm-R
cloning with +TypeII RE (recognize sequence and then cut at site one nucleotide next to recognition site)
division into three fragments
ask Dominik:
how exactly does this strategy work?
when is this an appropriate strategy to use?
Is "PCR Ligation" also a good Method (seperate PCRs for fragments; primers have "overlapping tail" takend from next fragment; ligation of fragments in one single PCR")?
Important! What about Freiburg? are they willing to help us with Gibson Cloning?
Approach of the Next Few Weeks
What should be bought: ---> Konrad's list
divison into smaller groups dealing with the main topics of our projects:
Indigoidine (closed): Rald, Konrad, Nikos
Del H lab protocol/methods (closed) : Hanna, Fanny, Sophie
Del Rest (A to P) (closed) : Flo, Ilia, Nikos, Nils
NRPS : Tania, Joschua, Ilia
Software : Nils, Ilia, Konrad, Joschua, Hanna
Decisions Made
serial cloner should be our main software used for primer design etc.
Should use tool for oligo 2ndary structre prediction
http/mfold.rna.albany.edu
Should create common primer list; structure as in the following:
continous number, primer name, abbreviation (initials), sequence, details (if possible with a link to protocol used), creator, date, evaluation (e.g. worked, low yield ... )
Agenda for next meeting (13.05.2013 6 pm)
all groups meet up seperately and continue working
brief presentation on next meeting
next meeting (with Dominik)
progress report of individual groups and lab
prepping for upcoming big meeting
Next big meeting will be 15.5.2013
