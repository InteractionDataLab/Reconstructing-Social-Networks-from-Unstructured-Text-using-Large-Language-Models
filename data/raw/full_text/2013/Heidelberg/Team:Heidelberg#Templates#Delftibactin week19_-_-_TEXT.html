Optimizing Growth Conditions of D.acidovorans and Evaluation of Endogenous Background Gold Precipitation
In order to optimize plates for cultivation of D.acidovorans as well as to evaluate of endogenous capability of possible target strains, capability of D.acidovorans and E. coli DH10ß and BL21 DE3 grown on LB and ACM plates was tested.
On Agar Plate following ON Incubation at 30°C
On agar plates, D.acidovorans, E.coli DH10ß, and Bl21 were plated from liquid culture and grown ON at 30 °C.
The following day, 1.6 ml soft agar (0.5%) was mixed with goldchloride [100 g/l] as follows:

Evaluation of Bacteria regarding Background Gold Precipitation on Agar Plate following ON Incubation at 30°C
ACM plate before incubation with gold chloride containing soft agar.
ACM plate after incubation with gold chloride containing soft agar counter-clockwise beginning from top left in concentrations of 0 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM.
All bacteria showed strong and immediate purple-black coloring indicating gold precipitation depending on gold chloride concentration. Regarding the precipitation of gold, there does not seem to be a significant advantage of D.acidivorans. In contrast to the paper from Johnston et al., we only grew them ON at 30°C rather than for 3 days. We will repeat the experiment using 3 day incubation time and also evaluate gold precipitation on additional media as well as by additional bacteria.
