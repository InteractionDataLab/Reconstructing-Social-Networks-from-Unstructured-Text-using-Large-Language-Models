Generation of pSB6A1
Miniprep
Grow pSB6A1 from glycerol stock in 2 ml LB Amp ON at 37°C.
Miniprep using miniprep kit from Qiagen and dilute in 30 µl ddH2O.
Result
Concentration 69.5 ng/µl
Digest
The pSB6A1 was generated from the parts registry and cut with EcoRI & PstI
Template DNA

The digest was incubated 45 min at 37°C.
Result
Expected band: 3985 bp (pSB6A1) and at 1106 bp (insert=J04450)

l1:2-log ladder, l2-3:digested pSB6A1
expected band at 4 Kb was cut out
=> Expected bands are present. Backbone pSB6A1 was cut out and gel purified (c=4 ng/µl).
Generation of AraC Fragment
Gel Extraction
Gel extraction was performed with the gel extraction kit from Qiagen of gel slice (cut 24-05) and was eluted in 30 µl.
Result
The measured concentrations are shown in the table below and was stored at -20°C.

The ligase was inactivated by heat shock for 5 min at 70°C.
Transformation
Afterwards, a transformation was performed with 15 µl of the ligation reaction in competent TOP10.
Cells were streaked on LB Amp plates and incubated ON at 37°C.
Induction
The following day, 5 white colonies were picked (because the red ones still have the mRFP insert J04450) and were incubated in 2 ml LB Amp with 20 µl Arabinose (10%) and 100 µl X-Gal (20 ng/µl).
Result
2 of the colonies turned blue
=> Perform miniprep .
Miniprep
Miniprep was performed according to Qiagen's instructions.
