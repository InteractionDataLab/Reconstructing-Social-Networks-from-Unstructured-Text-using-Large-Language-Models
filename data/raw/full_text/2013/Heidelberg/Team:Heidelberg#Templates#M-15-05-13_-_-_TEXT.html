State of the lab
backbones
psB4K5 for Del A-P is ready
psB6A1 for DelH not
psB1C3 for Indigoidine is ready
DelH
two parts via SalI (8 kb and 10 kb) successfully amplified
will be integrated into plasmid for electroporation in E. coli
Further plan
methylmalonyl-CoA-strain
K207-3 is not available
we get BAP1
Lambda-red plasmid
FLP plasmid
Template plasmid
DelH
Expression in E. coli end of may
Indigoidine and NRPS library
problems concerning RFC10
Gibson Info Freiburg required
Washington standard: contact Washington team! (Fanny?)
Gibson assembly
maybe method of choice
are there protocols or do we have to delelop standard protocols
small fragments could be a problem (PCP-domain)
develop Gibson RFC standard for NRPS library?
Gibson approach, Indigoidine and NRPS library
problems with RFC10 restriction sites and gene size
DelA-P Cloning strategy
leave out not necessary genes like DelC
five cluster fragments
use Gibson cloning
Dominik: mid of next week we will get further information
avoid too big PCR-constructs; 10 kb has been very difficult to amplify
Indigoidine
try plasmid, reproduction of paper
seperate domains (A, T, TE) and fuse again to proove modularity
maybe exchange domains with domains from other pathways
Müller Plasmid -> new problem of 11 restriction sites
How do we want to assemble NRPS modules in our project?
maybe Berkeley RFC21 standard because it works very good for our gene clusters
compatible with linkers
allows fusion protein
not accepted by iGEM registry
BglIII cannot be heat-inactivated
benign scar (GS)
Washington pGA
Gibson Assembly Toolkit
based on RFC21 backbone
standards...
mix and match domains not using biobrick standard but another strategy
it is too much work to get our parts conform to RFC10 and the NRPS-pathways are not realy compatible with RFC10 at all
after first experiments consider codon optimized synthesis for part submission
other NRPS not standardised, but propose a new standard
few characterized parts are of more value than a hundret useless ones
conclusion
why not omit RFC and start with Gibson at the first point
get expertise in Gibson cloning (read papers)
Hanna and Julia (TA) should try Gibson assembly together
Software
iGEM pulse
use scrapy (python) to get data from last years wikis -> MySQL (first subgroup)
develop parameters for iGEM oulse webpage (second subgroup)
First Deadline: May 24
detailed plan on data mining and parameter design
Second Deadline: End of June
valuable product
NRPS software
NRPS library software starting after proof of cencept in Indigoidine
predict required domains for input structure and propose cloning protocol
Budget
possible sponsors
Klaus Tschira as main sponsor
talk to other sponsors for small fundings (connections...)
university funding, helmholtz, biotech,
sponsorship benefits?
logos on Shirt, Website, presentation
Miscellaneous
reservation of lufthansa flights for Boston!
group tickets are cheaper
greater flexibility
book hotels/ guest houses in Lyon!
marketing will be done by professionals
They will need the project description with loads of random pictures (domains, gold, electronic waste, cash, ...)
will be there at the next meeting
Conclusion
start Indigoidine subproject with Gibson cloning (faster!)
take care about hotels, flight (Sophie)
project proposal, sponsor list (coordinated by Fanny)
creative input for marketing people
Agenda for next meeting with Advisors (06.06.2013)
talk to marketing people
progress in labwork
DelA-P
Indigoidine
DelH
travel agency
project proposal, sponsor list
