Restriction Digest
DelH F1a was restricted with EcoRI & PacI.
Afterwards it was purified with nucleotide removal kit and DNA concentration was measured.

Purification of Restriction Digest
Add 1 ml isopropanol
Centrifuge 20 min full speed
Discard supernatant
Add 750 µl 70% ethanol
Centrifuge 5 min full speed
Discard supernatant
Dry for 10 min
Resuspend in 20 µl H2O
Result
DNA-concentration was measured at the Nanodrop c=21 ng/µl.
Re-PCR Conditions F1a.W8.A
In order to increase the product yield, F1a was amplified from the PCR fragment produced in week 7 using PCR conditions F1a.W7.A and short2 primer.

Electroporation
As described in methods Electroporation of E. coli DH10β
One Eppi with DNA of ligation with 20 µl
Second Eppi with DNA of ligation with 50 µl (more DNA)
Streaked on LB Amp plates. Of each electroporated aliquot, one plate with 10 µl and another with 100 µl of the cells was spread.
Incubation ON at 37°C.

There is nothing to see on gel, most probably due to too little amounts of DNA.
Colony-PCR
Only few colonies (~10) grew on both 100 µl plates.
Of 8 colonies from each 100 µl plate, a colony-PCR was performed.
Inocculation of PCR colonies into 1 ml LB Amp-Ara-XGal ON at 37°C.

Fig.8.3 gel of colony PCR (loaded 5 µL)
l1: 2 log ladder, l2-6: colonies 1-5 screened with PCR conditions mentioned above
l2 shows expected band
Only colony 4 (second lane) shows expected band at ~600 bp. Yet, no blue color could be detected in ON culture, even in pellet (frozen for SDS Page).
=> This means, that our ligated plasmid was successfully transformed, but lacZ is not expressed.
Will run SDS-PAGE of transformed cultures and parental stock. Also inocculate cultures using higher concentrations of arabinose and X-Gal.
Stronger Induction of lacZ Expression
Inocculated single colonies from day before into 5 ml LB Amp-Ara-XGal using 2x amounts of arabinose and X-Gal stock solutions (maybe concentrations of stocks are too low or promoters need stronger induction).
Incubation ON at 37°C.
Result
No lacZ expression was observed.
