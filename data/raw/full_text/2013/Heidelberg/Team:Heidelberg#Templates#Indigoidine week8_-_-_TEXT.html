Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Indigoidine week8
From 2013.igem.org
Indigoidine production with pMM-plasmids IV (Ilia)
inoculate 5 ml LB + Kan with TOP10-pMM65
miniPrep of pMM65 -> 23 ng / µl
prepare TOP10-pMM65 glycerol stock
run PCR for T and TE domain of bpsA for pMM64 validation and of svp for pMM65 validation:
PCR for pMM64/65 validation (17-06-13); Ladder was missing, probably taken loading buffer by mistake; run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE); wanted amplicon size are: * bpsA_T: ~250 bp * bpsA_TE: ~850 bp * svp: ~800 bp
template each:
5 ng of miniPrep (from 2013-06-15)
picked colony from transformed TOP10
water as control
polymerase: Taq ( validation PCR )
used cycler protocol for svp and T domain of bpsA:

retransformation from filter paper provided bei Fussenegger group
TOP10
with 10 µl pMM64 from original filter paper, plate on Amp, grow at 37°C
with 10 µl pMM65 from original filter paper, plate on Kan, grow at 37°C
prepare TB medium for ON (for comparement with LB)
colony PCR for plated pMM64 and pMM65 strains from 2013-06-16
prepare combinatorial experiment with gibson cloning or CPEC (polysytronic expression of bpsA and svp in TOP10)
prepare primer for bpsA only plasmid for BAP1 validation
