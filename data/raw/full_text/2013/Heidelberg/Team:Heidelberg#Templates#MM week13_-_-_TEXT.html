Colony-PCR of BAP1-pKD46 electroporated with PCR amplificate of pLF03 grown on Cm+IPTG, grown in liquid culture and then transferred to Cm+IPTG (marked 2). Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lanes 2,4: BAP1-pLF03 (control); lanes 3,5: colony-PCR. Lanes 2,3: primers IK01+IK03; lanes 4,5: primers RB43+RB44

no positive PCR of colony yet: run colony-PCR with primers IK01+IK03 (iTaq, 20 ml total volume):

unspecific bands in colony, no sfp bands at all
re-run sfp PCR (primers RB43+RB44), include streaked BAP1 by Konrad
sfp present in BAP1, not present in BAP1-pLF03, colony
makes no sense, Konrad streaked his cells from the same batch of competent cells
transfer BAP1, BAP1-pLF03, colony to liquid culture LB, grow at 37°C
