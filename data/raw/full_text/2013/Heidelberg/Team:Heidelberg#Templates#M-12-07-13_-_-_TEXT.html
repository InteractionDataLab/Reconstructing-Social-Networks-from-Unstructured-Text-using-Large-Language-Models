Cooperation with Freiburg(Hanna)
arrive on Monday(14.7.) want to show us Gibbson Assembly
accomodation: Philipp, Julia, Hanna/Ralf
Would go out for Dinner at Schmidt's, Hanna is going to send an Email
we should take away all the things in the lab indicating our actual project with Delftibactin
Lyon (Hanna, Philipp, Tania)
hotel: 7x 3 people in one room
train to Lyon is booked, need to book the ride back on 15.7. (Monday)
Human Practice
Konrad offered to take care of the soil samples to send to the UK (?)
want to get some info on Streptomycces from them.
Fanny and bts take care of the discussion round
Financing, Karl Steinbruch Stiftung, Software Project
Anja: we need three people's CVs that have worked in Bioinfomatics and have more than 120 ECTS
they want to know about where we spent the money
max ammount is app. 830 €/month
dead line is 31.7.
Lab Update
Delftibactin
Del H
problems with 1B bands
new amplification worked
were digested and purified today
are going to be ligated tomorrow
Dominiks suggestion:
divide ligation after 1 hour into two, one is kept at -20°C the other is let continue over night at 4°C
pool both together and electroporate this batch
gibbson primers arrived today; this will be the new approach, if ligation is unsuccessful
parallel gibbson does not make sense, to expensive
---> gel is running right now and will influence decision on further proceeding
Del Rest
7-8 fragments of 32 are still missing
backbone has been amplified
Flo designed new primers
for DelOP
Indigoidine
pptase could be amplified, but not indigoidine synthetase
brainstorming
maybe the gene is not in this sub-species?
plamsid from UTAH arrived
want to write to other labs if they can send us the plasmid
there is a different Streptomyces (Stamm) that has this enzyme but need to finde the correct name
burocracy discussion.. MTA, Hauspost, Eils signature
primer strategy with BPSA
Tyrocidine
Stamm come from Marahije (?)
Glycerol stocks,colony PCRs
new strategy has be developed
ordering of primers by end of the week
Methyl-malonyl CoA
want genomic integration of substrate synthesis complex for DelF
got the insert from the USA
just need to amplify the insert with appropritate primers with some extra DNA
first tries didn't work
has several primers for accurate testing/screening
if integration worked only one resistance gene copy
gets fragment PLUS other bands of something else...
did electroporation and purification this week
some altered conditions
some good colonies
screening
NRPS
primary goals of the NRPS etc
NRPS are modulary
three domains, CA-T-optional
flexible linkers between domains
can be put into different orders
wetlab:
goal: library of physical DNA of single modules to be able to put into different orders
start with tyrocidine pathway
software:
tell what you want
has info on different pathways and domains
tells me how to ligate everything together etc
specifity is dependent on CA domain
look at what is most probable to work later
--> calculate evolutionary distance according to the taxon ids in the database
4 nodes:
b.brevis
e.coli.
p. aeruginosa
b.subtilis
Discussion about Linkers:
should they be standardized?
how should they look like?
domains are highly conserved among species and linkers are NOT conserved at all
