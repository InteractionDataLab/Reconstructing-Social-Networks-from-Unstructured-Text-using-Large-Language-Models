Restriction digest of fragment from FS_21 to FS_26; 5.5 kb; 29-07-2013) with ClaI
Restriction digest of DelG (SR01-FS23), DelG (FS21-FS26) and DelOP; run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE)(07.08)
Incubation at Room temperature for about 4h and at 37°C for 1 hours

Expected fragment lengths [bp]
2743, 1519, 1208
Results:
restriction digest of DelFG led to the expected fragment sizes, therefore restriction digest, implies amplification of the correct fragment
PCR product will be further validated by single read sequencing before Gibson Assembly
