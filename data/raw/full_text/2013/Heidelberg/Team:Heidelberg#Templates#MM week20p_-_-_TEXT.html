co-transform TOP10 with pRB22.3 and pIK7.1, plate on Cm+Kan, grow at 37°C
2013-09-10
after ca. 18h at 37°C: lots of tiny colonies, not blue
leave at RT in drawer (no light)
2013-09-11
colonies became blue
TOP10 cotransformed with pRB22.3 and pIK7.1
start constructing pIK8: promoter even weaker than the one used by Cambridge 2007, weak RBS
run PCRs of (2 ng DNA, 20 µl total volume, using Q5):

Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: f7; lane 3: f8
run gel, gel-purify fragments -> 6.3 ng/µl in 20 µl (f7); 36.1 ng/µl in 20 µl (f8)
perform Gibson assembly: 8 µl f7, 2 µl f8, 10 µl MM, incubate at 50°C for 1h
dilute Gibson mix 1:4, electroporate electrocompetent DH10ß with 1 µl, 14 µl of dilution
plate 10 µl, rest on Cm, grow at 37°C

very large and very small colonies present, pick starting with small colonies, run colony-PCR with primers IK26+VR (iTaq, 20 µl total volume) using 2 ng of BBa_I746200 in pSB1AK3 as positive control:

clones grown in eppendorf tubes in 2xYT+Cm at 37°C

Colony-PCR of DH10ß transformed with pIK8 and primers IK26+VR. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lanes 2-11: colonies; lane 12: positive control (BBa_I746200 in pSB1AK3)
run gel
colonies designated pIK8.1, pIK8.2, pIK8.6, pIK8.9 positive
transfer to baci falcons, add 2xYT+Cm, grow at 37°C

Restriction digest of pIK8 with BamHI+HindIII. Lane 1: NEB 2-log; lane 2: pIK8.1; lane 3: pIK8.2; lane 4: pIK8.6; lane 5: pIK8.9
make miniPreps: 73.5 ng/µl (pIK8.1), 12.9 ng/µl (pIK8.2), 289.0 ng/µl (pIK8.6), 169.0 ng/µl (pIK8.9) in 37.5 µl each
digest with BamHI+HindIII using 2 µl (pIK8.1), 10 µl (pIK8.2), 1 µl (pIK8.6), 1 µl (pIK8.9) DNA (20 µl total volume)
expected: 2.1 + 7.3 kb
