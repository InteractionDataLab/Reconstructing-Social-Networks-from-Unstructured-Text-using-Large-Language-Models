Results:
Amplification of DelFG worked, but amount of DNA was insufficient
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
PCR will be carried out with another cylcer which by experience of the last amplifications led to higher product yields.

Results:
Amplification of DelFG was successful
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
obtained DNA will consequently be used for Gibson Assembly
PCR will be repeated to get higher amounts of DNA and increase concentration by purifying several gel slices using the same QIAquick spin column
