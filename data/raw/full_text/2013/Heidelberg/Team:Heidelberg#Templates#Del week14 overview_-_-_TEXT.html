Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Del week14 overview
From 2013.igem.org
Amplification and purification of Del Genes from D. acidovorans DSM-39 genome
Goals
Our goal still remains to amplifiy the missing fragments from the Delftibactin cluster of D. Acidovorans. However, since we want to validate all fragments before we use them in a Gibson Assembly, and since last weeks restriction digests were either negative or inconclusive, these digests will be repeated. By the end of this week we will dicuss the further procedure and decide whether we again need to change our cloning strategy or not. Additionally a nested PCR of the sequence region surrounding DelOP might still be an option to provide specific template suitable for a PCR with our intended Gibson primers.
