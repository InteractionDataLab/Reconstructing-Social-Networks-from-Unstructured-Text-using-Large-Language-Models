Team:Heidelberg/Templates/Indigoidine week7 overview
From 2013.igem.org
Indigoidine Production - bpsA
Since we couldn't observe indigoidine production using pMM64 and pMM65 in the previous two weeks we validated the pMM-plasmids using restriction digests.
The restriction digest of pMM65 was correct but pMM64 didn't show the expected bands on an agarose gel. We continued trying to amplify the bpsA and svp gene in a PCR screening.
