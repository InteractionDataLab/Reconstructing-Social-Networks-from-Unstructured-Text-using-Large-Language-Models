Triple Clone pIK.6, DelRest and DelH C5
Electroporation
E. coli BL21 DE3 + DelRest + pIK8.6 were electroporated with DelH C5 miniprep DNA and streaked on 2YT + Amp + Chlor + Kan plates and incubated at RT for 2 days.
Evaluation of Gold Precipitation on ACM Plates
In order to evaluate gold nanoparticle formation capacity DelH clone C5 in presence of DelRest and pIK8.6, they were streaked on ACM plates as follows and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. As controls, we used the BL21 DE3 transformed with pSB3C5 and pSB6A1.

Following 3 day incubation, 200 µl 5 mM gold chloride in soft agar was applied.
Result
Evaluation of Gold Precipitation of C5 Triple Clone on ACM Plates following 3 day Incubation at 30°C

Unexpectedly, the D.acidovorans control grew on the ACM + Amp + Chlor + Kan plates, indicating a contamination with triple resistant bacteria. Therefore, the experiment is inconclusive and has to be repeated. Moreover, the background control shows significant activity.
Nevertheless, there was neither increased activity of the induced 'E.coli BL21 DE3 containing DelH C5, DelRest and pIK8.6 compared to the E.coli BL21 DE3 negative control nor to the not induced control.

Inoculation of 10 ml of over night cultures of each sample
Growth at 30°C
For each culture, 1 L of ACM media with antibiotics was inoculated with the pre-culture
Expression was induced in all E. coli BL21 DE3 with 1 mM IPTG after 24 h of growth
All cultures were supplemented with 10 mM sodium propionate after 24 h of growth
The cultures selected with ampicillin were supplemented with an additional 1:2000 ampicillin after 24 h of growth
Cultures were harvested after 48 hours of growth and 24 hours after induction
Purification of Delftibactin
Centrifugation of cultures at 3750 rpm for 45 min
Protocol for liquid culture

Added 20 g/L HP-20
Stirred at RT for 2 h
Filtration with Buchner funnel to retain HP-20
Washed with 400 ml dddH2O
Elution with 400 ml Methanol
Evaporated methanol with rotary evaporator
Resuspended in 2 ml 50 methanol : 50 ddH2O
Protocol for pellet
Kept pellet
Washed pellet with destilled water
Resuspended pellet in 50 ml destilled water
Freeze and thawed 8 times
Centrifugation at 3750 rpm for 30 min
Kept supernatant
Added 20 g/L HP-20
Stirred at RT for 2 h
Filtration with Buchner funnel to retain HP-20
Washed with 400 ml dddH2O

MICRO-TOF
File:Heidelberg 20131004 MicroTOF.pdf
Result
Unexpectedly, the D. acidovorans positive control was negative for expression of Delftibactin. The results are therefore inconclusive and the experiment has to be repeated.
