Results:
restriction digest did not work as expected
test restriction will be repeat with higher amount of enzyme and longer incubation time

Results:
Amplification of DelAE worked, but a slight smear as well as several unexpected bands occured
bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit but PCR has to be further optimized in order to improve product quality
