Team:Heidelberg/Tempaltes/iGEM42-W-19b
From 2013.igem.org
Data completion
As the data was not yet completely converted to R, the script doing so was altered to also include the results from the methods, meshterms and topics extractions, as well as the medals awarded. Prior to this the data update concerning the 2007 awards had to be manually corrected, since the registered team names and those on the results page were not exactly the same in some cases. These were:
Wisconsin
MIT
St. Petersburg
Davidson Missouri
Boston U
Mississippi
Berkeley
Michigan
Colombia Israel
