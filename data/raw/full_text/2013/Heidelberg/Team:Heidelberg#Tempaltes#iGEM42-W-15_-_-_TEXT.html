Team:Heidelberg/Tempaltes/iGEM42-W-15
From 2013.igem.org
Implementation of Topics app started
For the topics and the methods app we had several ideas on how to structure them. Besides a timeline of the hottest topics or histogramm view of the topics distribution the most important feature we had in mind was the direct search for the meshterms we extracted.
Pseudocode for the corresponding filtering functions and a draft of the interface were written, but the workload in the other projects was too big to actually create a functional app.
