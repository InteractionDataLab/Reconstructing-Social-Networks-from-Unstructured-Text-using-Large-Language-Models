Gold
we were able to reproduce the paper --> images with gold
delftibactin purification didn't work by now --> try again
recapitulation of NRPS domains and modularity
domains that are essential: C: Condesantion, A: Adenylation, T: Thiolation
what has been done
simplification of synthases (smaller linkers) -> no negative effects
replacement of alanin to serene by changing domain
module extention
short de-novo NRPs
NRPS biobrick library
produce a library with different combinable NRPS-subunits
start with producing staphcillin (has already been done --> realistic to achieve)
Coloured NRP: indigoidine (Ralf)
we could prove the modularity of our NRPS-library by producing indigoidine
is a blue dye
synthesized from 2 gylcin molecules with a certain enzyme
there are only a few cutting sites in the required genes
Cosmide (Hanna)
insert size 50kbp
has got cos site --> in vitro packaging
has got only very few cutting sites (BamH1)
selection maker: ampicillin
check of digestion with 0.8% agarose gel
preparation with phenol/chloroform extraction
Phagemids & PACs (Flo)
Phagemids
you can infect cells with phages or by electroporation
10-20 kbp
high yield of DNA
E. coli have too be competent for F-Phages
DNA extraction via phages
PACs
p1 artificial chromosomes
hybrid system of plasmid and p1 phage replication
insert size 70-150 kbp
transformation using phages
isolation with kit possible (QIAGEN)
good transformation-rate but complex system
you have to be very careful working with phages --> easy contamination
BACs (Fanny)
Recombineering
well established system
150-350 kbp
low copy numbers
"lamda red recombination" using 3 viral genes: 5'-3' exonuclease, overhang binding protein, inhibitor of bacterial exonuclease
use of cassette with pos and neg selection marker
electroporation of gene of interest
cloning: cassette is brought into the BAC by homologous recombination --> also several times possible
there is a library of E. coli strains which already have the cassette
Gibson cloning (Nikos)
iGEM biobrick standard will be hard for us to realize --> delH
we will promote modularity with the NRPS library
for the gold project we will likely use gibson cloning
we will talk about primer design on saturday (4th May)
start PCR as soon as possible
