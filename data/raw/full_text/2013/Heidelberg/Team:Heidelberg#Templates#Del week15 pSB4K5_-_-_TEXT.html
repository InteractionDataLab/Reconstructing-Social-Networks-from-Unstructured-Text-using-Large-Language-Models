Results Sequencing
Send the backbone pSB4K5 from the partsregistry to GATC for sequencing:
pSB4K5 with Primer FS_01
pSB4K5 with Primer FS_16
Alignment of pSB4K5(FS_01 to FS_16) with Primer FS_01
Alignment of pSB4K5(FS_01 to FS_16) with Primer FS_16
Results:
The sequence is the same as expected and indicated in the partsregistry.
Amplification from FS_01 to FS_16; 4.2 kb
Amplifcation of DelG (SR01-FS23), pSB4K5 and DelAFII; run at 100 V, 0.8 % gel (TAE)(07.08)

Results:
Amplification worked very well, we had bright bands on the right height.
Bands were cut out and DNA purified using QIAquick Gel Extration Kit.
