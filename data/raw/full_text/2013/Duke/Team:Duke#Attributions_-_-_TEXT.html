Attributions
The Duke iGEM team would like to acknowledge the individual contributions of its members, supporting groups, and our funding sources.
Attributions:
Matthew Baron (M.B), Matthew Farnitano (M.F)., Cameron Kim (C.K.), Hyun Soo Kim (H.K.), Ashley Reid (A.R.) and Janan Zhu (J.Z.) are the undergraduate students on the Duke iGEM team. All work performed on this project has been completed by these members. In addition, all information on this Wiki has been written by these members.
Charlie Cooper (C.C.) is our graduate student mentor who has provided guidance and assistance on this project.
Dr. Nicolas Buchler (N.B.) and Dr. Charles Gersbach (C.G.) are the principal investigators on this project.
M.B., M.F., and C.C. designed the constructs used in this project.
C.C., C.K., and H.K. worked on the mathematical modeling project.
M.B., M.F., H.K., A.R., and J.Z. built the constructs used in this project.
M.B., N.B., C.C., C.G., C.K., M.F., H.K., A.R., and J.Z. designed the experiments
C.K. and A.R. interviewed professors and designed the Human Practices component.
Next, we would like to acknowledge the support of many people on this project:
Dr. Nicolas Buchler and Dr. Charles Gersbach for their superior mentoring and support of our research.
Charlie Cooper, for always being in lab with us and mentoring us as we navigated our research experience
All members of the Buchler lab, especially Mert Aydin for helping us purchase primers and making our gBlocks work and allowing us to take a bench to work on this project.
All members of the Gersbach lab, especially Dewran Kocak for his assistance with our CRISPR/Cas9 project.
We would like to thank Dr. Shubhashini Chandrasekharan, Dr. Robert Cook-Deegan, and Professor Arti Rai for taking the time to be interviewed for our human practices discussion. Their insights and advice on how to pursue our project were extremely valuable to its success.
In addition, we would like to thank the following groups for providing support here at Duke University:
The Pratt School of Engineering and the Department of Biomedical Engineering  support C.G., as well as M.B., C.K., H.K, and A.R. The Pratt School of Engineering provides a Pratt Fellowship to C.K.
The Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy (IGSP) supports N.B., C.G., and C.K.
The Department of Biology provides support to N.B. and M.F.
The Department of Biophysics provides support to N.B. and J.Z.
The Department of Biochemistry provides support to C.C.
The Duke Undergraduate Research Support Office is a supporter of our program, and has provided travel grants to our members to attend the iGEM Regional Jamboree. -The Undergraduate Research Support Office also sponsors the Howard Hughes Research Fellows Program, which provided a fellowship to M.F.
Finally, we wish to thank the following funding sources for allowing our project to succeed.
The Lord-Alstadt Foundation has provided generous funding for this iGEM project and we thank them for their support.
C.G. is supported by the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award (DP2OD008586) and a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award (CBET-1151035).
N.B. is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director’s New Innovator Award (1DP2OD008654), Burroughs Wellcome Funds CASI Award (1005769), and DARPA Biochronicity grant (BAA-11-66)
Collaborations
We assisted the Purdue iGEM team in their efforts to design a more comprehensive characterization form for registry parts. We provided feedback through surveys on a couple of different occasions and participated in a Google Hangout with several other iGEM teams giving their thoughts on the new registry standard. Talking with other iGEM teams helped provide a little perspective as to the different means by which teams characterize parts.
