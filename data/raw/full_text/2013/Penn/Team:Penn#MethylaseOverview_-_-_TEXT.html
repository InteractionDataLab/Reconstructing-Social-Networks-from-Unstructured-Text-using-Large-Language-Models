Site-Specific Methylases
For a detailed, graphical explanation of the MaGellin work flow, please download the MaGellin Workflow Specifications Sheet , which includes all of the steps in the MaGellin workflow. After validating the MaGellin assay with non-specific methylases, we were ready to test site-specific methylases. Our MaGellin assay is ideal for high-throughput construction and testing of these enzymes. Site-specific methylases are fusion proteins: a DNA binding domain linked to a methylase by a serine glycine chain. They can direct DNA methylation to specific sequences, likely promoter regions for use as a transcriptional silencer. We used the prokaryotic methylase M.SssI for all of our studies (BBa_K1128000).
We wanted to first recapitulate published results with a zinc finger binding domain, and then characterize a novel site-specific methylase using a TALE DNA binding domain.
