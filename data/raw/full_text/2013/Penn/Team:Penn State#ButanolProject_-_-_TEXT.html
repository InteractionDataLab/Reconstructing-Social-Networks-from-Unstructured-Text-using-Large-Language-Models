Butanol in Plants Project
The butanol project’s goal is to synthetically produce the enzymes that make up the University of California’s cyanobacteria pathway to produce n-butanol within physcomitrella. Thereby making a plant directly produce n-butanol, an industrially relevant compound that can serve as a more efficient biofuel than ethanol. The project took on another goal when it was realized that an intermediary compound in the pathway could be used to produce (R)-Polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic.

Introduction
Butanol is a four carbon alcohol with several different industrial uses such as the creation of polymers and pharmaceuticals.  However, its most notable use is as a fuel for internal  combustion engines.  Butanol is fairly non-polar due to its longer hydrocarbon chain, and is  more similar to gasoline than other small alcohols such as ethanol.  The fact that it is similar in  function to gasoline means that butanol can be used in automobiles without any changes.  This is  significant because butanol can be synthesized from biomass.  Organisms such as cyanobacteria,  diatoms, and the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum have already been shown to produce  butanol using various methods.
Our other potential product is polyhydroxybutyrate or PHB.  PHB is a polymer in the polyesters class that has many uses similar to other plastics of the same variety.  The reason this  one is an interesting option is the fact that it is nontoxic and biodegradable.  This fact makes  PHB an excellent choice for potential use in the medical industry as well as others.  Biosynthesis  of the polymer is currently achieved using microorganisms.  Our goal was to extend the  production capabilities to plants; specifically Physcomitrella patens.
Background
Our work focuses on the ATP dependent pathway described by the University of  California.  The image below gives an outline of the pathway used.  Refer to the red line.

We designed three constructs based on the pathways for the synthesis of butanol and  PHB.  The first of the three (Castor) is the same for both pathways and brings the reaction to the  intermediate 3-(R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.  After that the reaction can proceed as shown above or  with the enzyme Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase or PhaC the intermediate can be used to make  PHB.  Castor can be ligated together with either of the other two constructs to create a useful  pathway for one of our products.
Method
The amino acid sequences used for the enzymes were converted back into nucleotide  sequences and then optimized for use in plants, or more specifically Physcomitrella patens.  The  sequences were then optimized into ~500 base pair gBlocks final constructs were then built using Gibson Assembly or CBAR.  Then the constructs were  ligated into our vectors; which were Ti-plasmids.   TM which were synthesized.  The
The entire pathway was broken into two distinct pieces, each of which gives us  one of our two final desired products.  The first half of both constructs brings us to 3-(R)- hydroxybutyryl-CoA and is referred to as Castor.  This can then be converted into either butanol  or PHB depending on the following enzyme(s) in the pathway.  The first construct consists of the  preliminary pathway and an additional four enzymes in a construct referred to as Pollux which  converts 3-(R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into butanol.  The other is a single enzyme after the first  half that gives us PHB.  The construct containing the single enzyme is named after the enzyme:  PhaC.
Results
Pending...
After transfection with Agrobacterium of the Castor and PhaC constructs into Nicotiana, the  transiently transformed leaf segments were excised and stained. The leaf segments and control leaf  cuttings were examined with spinning disk confocal microscopy for the presence of Polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB) granules. The preliminary staining results were inconclusive.
Expected Results:
Given ideal staining and PHB production in the cell cytoplasm, we expect to see granules of PHB  within the cells. These are expected to be well deﬁned against the background ﬂuorescence of the  stomata, tricomes, and cell walls. It is also expected that GC-MS should be able to detect the PHB from  the leaf cuttings.
Discussion
The preliminary results were inconclusive primarily due to issues with staining. The dye used was  not very soluble in water and produced a colloidal suspension. This resulted in some of the dye binding to  the surface of the leaf indiscriminately giving us false positives. A better dye that can more readily  penetrate the leaf and have better solubility may be required to obtain a clear result.
Further Study
The future goals are to continue testing with the Castor and PhaC constructs in Nicotiana, and  expand to testing in Physcomitrella. We are going to work on getting clearer microscopy results and GCMS results.
Another goal for the Butanol project is to assemble and test the Pollux construct for the  production of n-butanol. At this time we could also complete a protein extraction on samples using the  His-tags and categorize the 2A sequence utilized in the project. This could help us to ascertain the  efﬁciency of the 2A sequence in the respected test organisms.
Further categorization of the submitted constructs and their products is an ongoing task.
