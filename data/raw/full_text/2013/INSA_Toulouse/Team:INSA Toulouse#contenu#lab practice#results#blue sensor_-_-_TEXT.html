Results - Blue Light Sensor Characterization
Objective
Characterize the blue light sensor system (YF1-FixJ with its promoter FixK2). Reminder: in darkness, YF1-FixJ binds to the FixK2 promoter and actives the downstream coding sequence whereas with blue light, YF1-FixJ cannot bind to the FixK2 promoter, impeaching transcription.
Conception
The following construction was designed:
In order to mimic the real behavior of the blue light sensor system in the E. calculus design, YF1 and FixJ genes were placed under the control of the pTet promoter, the general inducer system . The transformed strain was supposed to express the modified RFP while in the dark. In blue light conditions, expression was supposedly promoted, except when aTc was added in the media.
Result
We did not obtain the previous construction but managed to construct a biobrick to characterize the blue light sensor system. YF1 and Fix J were placed under the control of a weak promoter.
Used parts are available here:
- Promoter J23116
- YF1-FixJ
- Terminator B1010
- FixK2 promoter
- RFP
The transformed strain was analyzed as follows:
Several subcultures were done to ensure that transformed bacteria were placed in light/dark states for at ~1000 generations. Visually, cultures in darkness did not show any differences with those placed under light conditions. Fluorescence measurements during 18 hours induction demonstrated the same inconclusive results.
Discussion
Our interpretation of the absence of expression of RFP is that the expression of YF1 and FixJ was too low to activate the FixK2 promoter. A biobrick without promoter in front of YF1 and FixJ was also submitted to the registry: YF1-FixJ-terminator-pFixK2-RFP . Adding a strong promoter may improve the system.
