Special acknowledgements
We received and used special parts from other research teams external to iGEM.
We have special thanks to:
Jérome Bonnet from School of Medicine (Stanford, USA) for sending us the Tp901 recombinase
Piro Suiti from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Massachusetts, USA) for sending us the φC31 recombinase
Otherwise, the entire project has been designed by the team of students during weekly meetings, with interventions from our supervisor Gilles Truan. All laboratory manipulations have been proceeded by students.
We received ponctual advices from following collaborators: Florence Bordes, François Cornet, Thomas Lautier, Claire Moulis, Magali Remaud-Simeon and Caroline Schiavon.
