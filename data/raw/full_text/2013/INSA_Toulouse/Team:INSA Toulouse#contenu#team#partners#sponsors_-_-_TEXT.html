Financial support is mandatory for successfully achieving scientific projects. iGEM projects do not depart from this golden rule.   Our wonderful scientific and human adventure would never have been possible without the generous contributions of our different sponsors.
We would like to truely thank them for supporting young student scientists in their innovative approaches and for promoting strong initiatives in Synthetic Biology such as the iGEM project. These private and public sponsors are demonstrating their implication in encouraging scientific discovery, nurturing new and cutting-edge concepts, stimulating a healthy emulation in a world-wide competition and finally encouraging young students to commit themselves to a challenging project.
Those private and public sponsors have demonstrated their commitment to scientific innovation and higher education and we would like to express them our deepest thanks
We collected around 30,000 € from our generous sponsors. We also received generous gift in the form of free consumables or special sale prices on molecular biology items and free use of dedicated software.
These contributors are:
-  For direct financial support: Adisseo, EADS Fondation, Genotoul, INSA, LISBP, Lesaffre, Roquette, Sanofi, Sofiprotéol, TWB
-  For generous gift of consumables: AgileBio, Biosentec, LISBP
-  For special sale prices: ThermoScientific

INSA INSA Toulouse (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées or National Institute of Applied Science of Toulouse) is a famous five year engineering school which graduates almost 500 students each year, in 8 different specialties, from informatics to civil engineering including also for examples nanotechnology engineering or biochemical engineering. The INSA Toulouse is composed of 220 teachers and teacher-researchers, 230 administrative employees, and 8 research laboratories. The school celebrated its 50th year anniversary last year.
LISBP Laboratory of Engineering of Biological Systems and Process (LISBP) is a mixed research unit (UMR) attached to INRA (UMR 792), CNRS (UMR 5504) and INSA, Toulouse. Internationally recognized, graded A+ by AERES in 2009 and with three awards under the “Investissements d’Avenir” (Investing in the Future) programme, LISPB holds an innovative position at the interface between life sciences and process sciences. Its work has applications in the sectors of health, biotechnologies, water and environment, food processing and agri-business, and chemistry.
LISBP is multidisciplinary (microbiology, biocatalysis, bioprocesses, separation techniques …); it works on uniting Systems Biology, Processes and Engineering, and has a triple engagement centred around Research, Training, and Transfer and Exploitation. With the ambitious aim of federating competence “from gene to process” while combining scientific excellence with economic and social pertinence, LISPB is crossing divisions, applying a multi-scale strategy, and building networks in the local and international environment.
TWB Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB) is an infrastructure project, designed to become a “centre of excellence” in the field of “white” (also called “industrial”) biotechnology in Toulouse. White biotechnology is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including manufacturing of chemicals, alternative energy (or «bioenergy») and biomaterials. It includes the practice of using cells or components of cells -like enzymes- to generate industrially useful products.
