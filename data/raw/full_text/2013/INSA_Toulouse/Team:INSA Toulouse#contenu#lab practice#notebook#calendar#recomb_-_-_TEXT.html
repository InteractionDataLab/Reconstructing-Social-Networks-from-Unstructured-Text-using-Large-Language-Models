26/08
Cloning
-Purified PhiC31* in pSB1C3
-Purified Tp901.1 in pSB1C3
27/08
Minipreps and gel verification on PhiC31* and Tp901.1 with EcoRI/PstI: failed for the most part.
28/08
Further verifications on Tp901.1 and PhiC31* with HindIII, NcoI, EcoRI and PstI: failed.
29/08
New gel extractions for PhiC31* and Tp901.1 from Strataclones.
Cloning:
-  rbs-FimE-term in  Pweak
- Bxb1 in Pweak-rbs
- Rbs-Bxb1 in Pweak
Rbs-Bxb1 confirmed by sequencing, but the terminator is absent.
30/08
Cloning of PhiC31* and Tp901.1 in pSB1C3.
No clone for Pweak- rbs-Bxb1.
Minipreps and gel verification on FimE and Bxb1 with EcoRI/PstI:  success.
31/08
No clones for Tp901.1 and PhiC31*. 02/09
Gel extractions and cloning of PhiC31* and Tp901.1 in pSB1K3.
For Pweak-rbs-Bxb1, further verification by restriction with:
- EcoRI
- AvrII/PstI, AvrII cutting in Pweak
Length of the fragment obtained corresponds to what is expected. Success confirmed by restriction.
Week 13 (3-9 September)
03/09

For Pweak-rbs-FimE-term, further verification by restriction with:
- EcoRI
- AvrII/StuI, AvrII cutting inside Pweak and StuI inside FimE
Length of the fragment obtained corresponds to what is expected. Success confirmed by restriction.

Minipreps and gel verification on Bxb1 with EcoRI/PstI: Profiles seems weird. Need further verifications.
Pweak-rbs-Bxb1 confirmed by sequencing.
06/09
For PhiC31* and Tp901.1 in pSB1A3, minipreps digested with EcoRI/PstI seems to be ok only for PhiC31*.
For Bxb1, further verification by restriction with:
- EcoRI
- AvrII/ BamHI: BamHI cutting inside Bxb1
The results show that the cloning failed.
08/09
New cloning of Tp901.1 in pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and pSB1A3.
Further verifications with NcoI invalidate previous result on PhiC31* in pSB1A3.

Week 14 (10-16 September)
10/09
Minipreps on Tp901.1 are wrong.
11/09
Infusion primers received:
-PCR on the differents parts to join: Pweak+rbs - Tp901.1 or PhiC31.1 - Terminator - pSB1C3.
-Infusion reaction for both the recombinases.
-Transformation in Stellar competent cells.
13/09
Minipreps of infusion transformations. Infusion assembly failed.
14/09
New infusion reactions on PhiC31* and Tp901.1 with different concentrations of each part.
15/09
Screening of infusion results by PCR on colonies.
16/09
Migration of PCR screening. Tp901.1 seems to be good.
New infusion reaction for PhiC31*.
Week 15 (17-23 September)
17/09
Further verifications on Tp901.1 showed wrong results. No good news at all.
New infusion reaction for Tp901.1 with both PCR amplified and linearized plasmids.
PCR sreening on previous PhiC31* infusion reaction.
18/09
PCR screening failed for unknown reasons. Minipreps done on the previous PhiC31* infusion reaction and gave bad results.
Week 15 (24-30 September)
24/09
New infusion reaction with new primers: Vector+Pweak+RBS  -  Recombinase - Terminator.
26/09
Minipreps on previous infusion reaction gave bad results. We decide to keep on using original sequences of Tp901.1 and PhiC31 integrases for characterizations.
