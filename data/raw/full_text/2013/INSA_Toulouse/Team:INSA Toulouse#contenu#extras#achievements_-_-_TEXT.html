Foreword
Our initial project was the full realization of the E. calculus strain. We even thought of selling the idea to TI
. However, we soon realized that the full realization would probably take (a little
) longer than the three months devoted to the iGEM competition. Furthermore, we are also aware that integration of many independant biological modules is always more complicated than it seems. However, a first step toward integration is the demonstration that each biological module works individually as expected. We would then have good arguments in support of the feasibility of the whole project.
Our secondary goal was therefore to demonstrate the validity of our modules design. We then reorientated our experiments toward the characterisation of the different modules. Each module thus can be used independently by other iGEM teams because the submitted parts were designed without the output genes. Most intermediate molecular biology constructions are also deposited in the registry to facilitate the redesign of the modules. The results we have obtained are very promising and we hope that the modules we have constructed and characterized will have a long life in other worldwide iGEM teams, way after our 2013 project.
Interdisciplinarity is a pillar in Synthetic Biology. iGEM projects aim at modeling the biological reactions that were designed to promote a full integration of wet and dry lab experiments. Modeling the entire E. calculus system did not seem either feasible or even conceivable. We focussed on only part of the project. In our whole E. calculus design, the diffusion of the carry was critical to implement the bacterial full adder. We then considered that modelling the diffusion of the carry molecule (AHL) was essential to fully support the feasibility of the design. Our results will provide interesting concepts that we hope will serve for similar design where diffusion of small molecules are necessary to achieve specific biological functions.
