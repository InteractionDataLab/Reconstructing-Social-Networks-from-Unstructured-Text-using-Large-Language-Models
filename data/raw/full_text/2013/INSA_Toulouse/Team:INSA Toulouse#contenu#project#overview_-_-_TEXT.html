Why E.calculus ?
During our brainstorming meetings to decide what would be our iGEM project, many ideas on building artificial regulations came out. We realized that most biological regulation systems perform highly specific implicit operations (greater than, lower than, if, etc.). However, none of them are prone to execute real mathematical operations. We therefore decided to create a n-bit bacterial full adder which could be operated by the user and able to transmit a carry if needed. Considering that some of the previous iGEM projects tackled the bacterial adder concept, we envisioned a new strategy using recombination-based logic gates. The most important achievements were to demonstrate that recombination-based switches represent simple yet highly efficient genetic logic gates modules that can be further integrated into more complex genetic devices. Besides the full adder idea, these genetic devices should lead to substantial progresses in the design of artificially regulated synthetic pathways.
From TI83+ to E. calculus
An electronic full-adder consists of the association of 5 logic gates (2 XOR gates, 2 AND gates, and 1 OR gate) which are able to receive 3 input signals (2 input bits and the last stage carry) and give the right answer to the user. (View "Full Adder" Part)
With E. calculus we tried to link the various logic gate genetic devices to:
A semi-artificial input system converting 0 and 1 input signals (absence and presence of blue and red lights) into biological signals. (View "Input" Part)
The production and diffusion of a bacterial signalling molecule, acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) for the carry, transmitting the information of from one cell to the other (View "Carry" Part)
An easily readable result of the various operations consisting of a clearly visible output pigment: the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) (View "Output" Part)
