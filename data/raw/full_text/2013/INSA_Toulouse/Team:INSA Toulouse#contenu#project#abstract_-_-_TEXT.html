Abstract
Since the beginning of Synthetic Biology, people aimed to transpose electronic devices into genetic constructions. In recent publications ( Siuti and al. 2013 , Bonnet and al. 2013 ), a new design of one-way logical gates using Serine recombinases were described allowing to avoid reversibility of recombination and creating strong and robust genetic logical gates (AND, XOR, OR).
The E.calculus project consists in creating a n-bits full-adder using those kinds of logical gates, which should be able to execute a 2 bits counting and also transmit any carry on the next step of the counting.
