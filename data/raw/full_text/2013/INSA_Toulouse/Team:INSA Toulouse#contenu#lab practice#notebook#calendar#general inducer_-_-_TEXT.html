General Inducer Characterization
June 2013
Week 3 (24-30 June) Amplification of new biobricks for cloning:
BBa_J23119: Strong promoter,
BBa_P0440: rbs tetR term,
BBa_I13521: Ptet rbs RFP term.
July 2013
Week 4 (1-7 July)
Assembly of a strong promoter with tetR. tetR protein is necessary to inhibit the Ptet promoter.
Week 5 (8-14 July)
Assembly of Strong promoter-tetR with Ptet-RFP. The RFP should be inhibited by tetR and expressed in presence of atc.
The construction is then sent for sequencing.
Week 6 (15-21 July)
The sequencing shows that the construction include a mutated promoter instead of J23119. So we assembled tetR with Ptet-RFP.
Week 7 (22-28 July)
We assembled a Strong promoter with tetR-Ptet-RFP to finalize the construction.
August 2013
August 2013
Week 8 (29-4 August)
The tries didn’t work, so we did it again one more week the assembly of Strong Promoter with tetR-Ptet-RFP.
Week 9 (5-11 August)
Because none of last clonages worked, we tried with several promoters in order to increase our chances of success.
Week 10 (12-18 August)
None of the passed assemblies worked, so we tried with a weak promoter.
This one seems to work but we are waiting for the sequencing to confirm the construct.
