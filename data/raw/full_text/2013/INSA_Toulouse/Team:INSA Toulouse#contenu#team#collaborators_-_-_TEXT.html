Team INSA
NAME: Magali Remaud-Simeon
Professor at the National Institute of Applied Science of Toulouse. She focuses her research activities on enzyme engineering and  structure-activity relationship studies for white biotechnology, green chemistry, Food/Feed industries and synthetic biology.
NAME: Florence Bordes
Assistant professor at the National Institute of Applied Science of Toulouse. She focuses her work on engineering enzymes and microorganisms, more particularly in the field of lipid metabolism. She is also interested in the study of multienzymatic system.
NAME: Claire Moulis
Assistant professor at the National Institute of Applied Science of Toulouse. She focuses her research activities on Carbohydrate Actives Enzymes (Cazymes), from structure-function relationships studies to combinatorial enzyme engineering, dedicated to the synthesis of oligosaccharides, glyco-conjugates and/or polysaccharides.
Team IBCG
NAME: François Cornet
He leads a team called "Genetic Recombination and the Cell Cycle" hosted at the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology in Toulouse. He is specialized in  chromosome structure and segregation in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. His team develops approaches ranging from biophysical analysis of single nucleoprotein complexes to cytological studies of chromosome dynamics in living cells.
NAME: Caroline Schiavon
She is a research assistant in François Cornet laboratory. She is specialized in microbiology and molecular biology. She leads molecular genetic experiments and constructs tools to study chromosome segregation in Escherichia coli.
