Our City
Toulouse
Toulouse is a really pretty city located in southwestern France. With more than one million of inhabitants and around 200 000 students, Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France. Well known thanks to AIRBUS company and EADS group, Toulouse is also at the cutting edge of Biology. As a matter of fact Toulouse hosts “L’oncopole de Toulouse”, the largest cancer research centre in Europe and a lot of other laboratories such as the “LISBP” (Laboratory of Engineering of Biological Systems and Process) or the newly launch institute dedicated to industrial biotechnology “TWB”(Toulouse White Biotech).
Besides, Toulouse is a really pleasant city to live in as student or worker, in the middle of all the red brick houses, the wise walks along the river “Garonne”, and the several small traditional restaurants. People can also discover the famous “Place du Capitole”, the place where all the most important events take place.
