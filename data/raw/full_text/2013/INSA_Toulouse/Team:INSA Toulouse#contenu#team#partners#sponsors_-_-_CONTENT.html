Financial support is mandatory for successfully achieving scientific projects. iGEM projects do not depart from this golden rule.  
Our wonderful scientific and human adventure would never have been possible without the generous contributions of our different sponsors. We would like to truely thank them for supporting young student scientists in their innovative approaches and for promoting strong initiatives in Synthetic Biology such as the iGEM project. These private and public sponsors are demonstrating their implication in encouraging scientific discovery, nurturing new and cutting-edge concepts, stimulating a healthy emulation in a world-wide competition and finally encouraging young students to commit themselves to a challenging project.
Those private and public sponsors have demonstrated their commitment to scientific innovation and higher education and we would like to express them our deepest thanks
We collected around 30,000 € from our generous sponsors. We also received generous gift in the form of free consumables or special sale prices on molecular biology items and free use of dedicated software. 
These contributors are:
