Integration Protocols
Transduction Protocol
Preparation of the phage (lisis of the donor strain)
Dilution of an overnight culture at 1/100 in LB and CaCL2 5mM
Incubation until DO=1
Mix 0,3 mL of bacterias with 106 phages P1vir = 10-50µL
Incubation at 37°c during 20 min
Add 3mL of Soft Agar (50% hot LB + 50% LB agar) with the mix of bacterias then spread on LB agar plate
Incubation one night at 30°C
Swab of the phages and bacterias contained in the soft agar
Add 0,5mL of CHCl3 and 0,5mL of LB for approximately 3 mL of Soft agar
Vortex while mixing until obtained a texture type "scratched banana"
Centrifugate 10 min at 7000rpm at 4°C
Transfer the surnatant in a clean tube and add 0,2mL of CHCl3
Stock at 4°C
Inoculate of the phage from the doner strain to the recipient strain.
Overnight culture of the recipient strain
Incubation until DO=1 in LB and CaCl2 5mM
Mix 500µL of bacterias with phages
Stir together and vortex quickly
Incubation 20 min at 37°C
Centrifugate 4 min at 5000g max
Wash the pellet with 1 mL of LB with 7,5mM of NaCitrate
Incubation 1 hour at 37°C
Centrifugate 4 min at 5000g max
Wash the pellet with 100 µL of clean LB
Spread on LB agar plate with NaCitrate 7,5mM and the right selection antibiotic
Incubation 1 night at 37°C
Sub cloned on LB agar plate with selection antibiotic and NaCitrate 7,5mM
DeFRT Protocol with FLP recombinase
In order to make a deFRT of a strain, you further need to make competent cells of this strain and have a MINI Prep of the pFLP plasmid
Transform the strain with the pFLP plasmid
Phenotypic expression 2h (selection on Amp) or 3h (on Cm) at 30°C because pFLP is thermo-sensitive
Spread of the pellet with 100µL of LB on LB agar plate with Amp or Cm
Incubation 1 night at 30°C
Pick 4 or 5 clones in liquid LB, incubation 2 hours at 30°C then 3 hours at 42°C to express the recombinase
Dilute and spread 10-5 /10-6 on Lb agar plate.
Incubation 1 night at 42°C
Right clones are Cm S, Ap S, Kn S
Integration-excision protocol
For integration excision, the strain have to be Streptomycine resistant and you have to make competent cells of this strain.
Transform the strain with the pMS58 plasmid
Spread on LB Cm plate 1 night at 30°C
Streak 4 clones of the previous transformation on LB Cm at 42°C one night
Streak 4 clones of the first integration on LB Cm at 42°C one night
Streak 4 clones of the second integration on LB Strp 42°C one night
Sub-cloned few clones on LB Cm, LB Str and LB Kn at 42°C one night.
Right clone are StR CmS et KnR
