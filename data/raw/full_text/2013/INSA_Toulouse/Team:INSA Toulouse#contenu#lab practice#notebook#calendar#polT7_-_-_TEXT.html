T7 Polymerase
T7 polymerase is necessary in our system to activate the two T7 promoters in the AND1 and AND2 gate. We choose to extract it from the genome of E.Coli BL21-DE3. Cloning are necessary to add a promoter, a rbs and a terminator.  In order to characterize the activity of the polymerase, cloning of a RFP under T7 promoter control will be also lead.
June 2013
Week 3 (24-30 June) 25/06
PCR extraction of T7 polymerase from the genome of BL21-DE3 (UNIPROT accession number C6EJI5).
Primers was designed to included restrictions sites of EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI.

Verification by electrophoris gel 0,8%.
Presence of unspecific hybridation. Changes in the PCR conditions do not improved the results.
03/07
PCR extraction of T7 polymerase from the genome of BL21-DE3. Test of different hybridation temperatures
PCR condition (on colony): 5 min 95°,  1min30 95°, 1min30  between 57 and 63°, 2 min30 72°, 5min 72°, HOLD 4°; 35 run.

Results showed that 60,6 °C seems the best hybridation temperature. Absence of unspecific hybridation.
PCR purification using kit. It failed because of a defective buffer.
04/07
PCR extraction again using the same condition than yesterday.
Verification by electrophoris gel 0,8%.
Absence of T7 polymerase but presence of unspecific hybridation. PCR extraction seems to be extremely sensitive.
In order to maximize our chance to obtain the desired product of PCR reaction, we choose to test different hybridation temperature ( between 57 et 63 °C) and different concentration of DNA template (1,2, 4 µL in 50 µL total volume) at the same time.
