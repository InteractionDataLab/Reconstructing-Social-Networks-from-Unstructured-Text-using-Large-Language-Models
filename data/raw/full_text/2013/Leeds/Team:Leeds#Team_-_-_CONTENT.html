OF particular interest at the moment are lipid microbubbles and membranes, and bio-functionalised inorganic surfaces. Study of the systems is varied, inlcuding the analysis of the physical transport of metabolites across systems which directly relates to our fundamental understanding of cellular biology and systems. Additonally, Professor Evans is interested in the manipulation of biological sensing mechanisms, with current work that has successfully incorporated bovine rhodopsin into an artificial membrane assembly for use in optical spectroscopic devices, and other work using actin filaments to create synthetic <I>villi</I> within Giant Unilamellar Vesicles.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Fiona_Meldrum">Fiona Meldrum</SPAN></H3>Professor Meldrum's research interests fall under the general category of materials chemistry, but are particularly focused on crystal growth. The <A href="http://www1.chem.leeds.ac.uk//FCM/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Meldrum Group</A> is examining methods to produce crystals with defined properties, controlling their size, morphology, organisation and mechanical properties. Within this topic there is considerable emphasis on biological crystallisation processes, hence natural structures such as seashells, bones and teeth are used as an inspiration for the development of novel crystal growth strategies. These experiments also enable better understanding of natural crystal growth phenomena. The borad range of projects within the group call for a broad range of analytical techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman microscopy and X-ray diffraction.

Coming to Leeds in 2009, Dr. Dougan lectures in biological physics, and specializes in extremophiles - organisms that survive in extreme conditions. In 2010, Lorna received an ERC Fellowship, and now heads up the <A href="http://www.mnp.leeds.ac.uk/ldougan/index.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Dougan Group</A>. The group does research in many different areas, from life in extreme environments, to single-molecule manipulation to molecular self assembly and even cryo-preservation. The group make extensive use of Atomic Force Microscopes to study protein folding within extremophiles, as well as multiple techniques for analysis of lipid or amphiphillic systems, which frequently self assemble. This is important for the study of life, as these self assembling systems are the pre-cursors to cell formation, while understanding the energy landscape of a protein highlights how it affects its properties in varying environments.
Lorna is also very active within the Institute of Physics and the Astrobiology Society, recently giving lectures on <A href="http://www.eventsforce.net/iop/frontend/reg/tOtherPage.csp?pageID=110767&amp;ef_sel_menu=2385&amp;eventID=272&amp;eventID=272" class="external text" rel="nofollow">single molecule approaches to protein analysis</A> and <A href="http://astrobio.oma.be/pdf/meeting1_2013.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Extremophiles and extra-terrestial life</A> respectively.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chris_Jones">Chris Jones</SPAN></H3> Responsible for the delivery of undergraduate practical classes for Biochemistry and Microbiology teaching programmes.
