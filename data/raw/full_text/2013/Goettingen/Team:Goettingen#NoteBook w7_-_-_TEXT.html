Colony PCR for RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 re-trafo clones 1 to 10 (RT-C1 to RT-C10), Colony PCR for DarR and Riboswitch biobrick transformation from 15.7.13
Gel run: Colony PCR for RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 re-trafo clones 1 to 10 (RT-C1 to RT-C10)
-          Addition of 5 µl 5xLD to the samples
-          Loading of 5 µl of each sample on 1 % agarose gel
-          Loading of 3 µl 2 log ladder as a marker
-          Gel run at 100 V
-          EtBr staining + destaining in water
-          UV detection
Re-Trafo Clones 1, 4 – 7, 9 and 10 look promising: could contain RBS-GFP-Terminator construct in pSB1A3 backbone
è Re-Trafo Clone 2 has a strange additional band (from plasmid?)
è Re-Trafo Clone 8: no product
è Even for Plasmid of RBS-GFP-Terminator C12, the additional band at the height of the terminator PCR product is not seen à but for plasmid GFP this band could be visible… additionally strong band of GFP-Terminator C1 PCR product runs higher than band of PCR product for RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 à maybe I mixed up with the samples…? If so, all clones would contain the GFP-Terminator plasmid. But this cannot be…
è Sequencing of Re-trafo clones 1, 4 and 5??? Ask Katrin G. about her opinion of the gel!

Gel 2:
è Only for clone 4 two weak bands at 2 – 3 kb are seen, but this can actually not correspond to any of the biobricks. Could be the plasmid
è All clones are apparently negative corresponding to re-ligated pSB1C3-terminator… Don’t forget gel ex next time…XD

Transformation from 15.7.13,Colony PCR for RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 re-trafo clones 1 to 10 (RT-C1 to RT-C10)
Transformation from 15.7.13
-          Amp-plates:
negative control = negative/no clones
transformation of RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 plasmid: many clones on 50 µl and on rest plate
-          Cm-plates
Negative control = negative
Clones on all other plates including w/o insert control (forgot gel extraction of pSB1C3 vector à terminator insert is still in reaction mix; since we didn’t dephosphorylate the vector with AP, there will be false positives corresponding to plasmid part 7!); smaller and larger clones on all plates; further incubation over day since they were too small to be picked in the morning…
 
Colony PCR for RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 re-trafo clones 1 to 10 (RT-C1 to RT-C10)
-          According to protocol from 10.7.13
-          16x MasterMix
-          Clones 1 – 10 picked, streaked out on LBAmp-plate and used for inoculation of 25 µl reactions (blue tubes)
-          Controls: 1 µl of 1:10 dilution of plasmids part 7, part 8 GFP-Terminator C1 and RBS-GFP-Terminator C12 (yellow tubes)
