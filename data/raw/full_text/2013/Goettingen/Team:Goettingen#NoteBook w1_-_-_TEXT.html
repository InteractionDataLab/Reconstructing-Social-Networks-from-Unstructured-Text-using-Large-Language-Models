Plasmid mini-prep for Part1-7
Cryo-Stocks of E. coli transformants (C1, parts 1 – 7):
·         900 μl E.coli ON culture + 100 μl DMSO 100% in special tubes (ask Katrin or Katrin^^)
·         vortex
·         store at – 70 °C (red box)
Backup plates:
Storage   at 4 °C
 
Plasmid Mini-Preparation of parts 1 -   7:
ON   cultures of C1 for parts 1 – 7 with kit “NucleoSpin? Plasmid” von   Macherery-Nagel according to manual pp. 16-17 (NucleoSpin? Plasmid protocol   for purification of high copy plasmids)
Step   5: recommended   washing of silica membrane with buffer AW was performed
Step   7: Elution with buffer AE pre-heated to 50   – 60 °C (in future: DON’T elute with this buffer, use pre-heated HPLC-H2O instead! No one knows what’s inside the buffer and its   components (EDTA?) could interfere with sequencing and other reactions)

Transformation of GP 911
·         According   to the protocoll of AG Stülke
o   Started at 8.00; OD600 = 1.4 at 11.00h
o   For   the expression mix, the CSE supernatant was used instead of water.
Results:
 
controls on LB medium, containig the appropriate AB.
left: neg. control: 991 + water
right: pos. Control: 991 + BP121 (another cat cassette)

the pos. control on LB medium with cooked and sterile     filtrated supernatant
 
 
·         No   growth of the actual experiment on these plates (GP 991 + GP 997)
·         This   might be due to the fact that the expression mix, used during the trafo,   contained the supernatant containing all three antibiotics (E/L, tet, cat)
o   Redo   this next week with supernatant lacking the AB’s

Continue of transformation of competent E.   coli cells with pGP172 + cdaA (from #81) and pGP172 + DAC (from #101)
E. coli cells expressing pGP172 + cdaA (from #81) are   growing very slowly and have to be incubated longer
→ chose four clones and name them: #811,   812, 813 and 814
→ re-streak the om LB Amp100 plates
E. coli cells expressing pGP172 + DAC (from #101) are   growing normally
→ chose three clones and name them:   #1011, 1012 and 1013

Gel electrophoresis of colony PCR from 31.05.2013
Digestion of pGP172 + cdaA (L. monocytogenes) and pGP172 + DAC domain (L. monocytogenes) with SacI and BamHI
Gel electrophoresis of colony PCR from   31.05.2013
The obtained PCR products were analyszed   on 1% agarose gel. Clones #81 – #90 should contain pGP172 + cdaA (L.   monocytogenes). Clones #101 – #110 should obtain pGP172 + DAC domain (L.   monocytogenes). Therefore a band of about 900 bp were expected for clones   #81 – #90 and a band of about 600 bp for clones #101 - #110
Gel: Marker (100 bp ladder) | clones #81   – #90 | clones #101 – #102 | Marker (1kb ladder)
Gel: Marker (100 bp ladder) | clones #103   – #110 | control (w/o insert)
For all clones could be a specific band   and therefore also a specific PCR product were obtained. The plasmids from   clone #81 and #101 were extracted and purified by peqlab Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's   protocoll.
→ The concentration was measured by   NanoDrop: 81/cdaA (L. monocytogenes): 27 ng/μl 101/DAC domain (L.   monocytogenes): 27 ng/μl

The digestion products were analyzed on   1% agarose gel.
Gel: Marker (100 bp) | undigested pGP172   | cdaA insert | DAC insert | ligation control | digested pGP172 + cdA |   digested pGP172 + DAC
The digested plasmids show bands for     the undigested pGP172, for the corresponding insert as well as a band for     the undigested pGP172 including the insert. Furthermore could be an     additional band in the ligation control as well as in the digested pGP172 +     cdA and the digested pGP172 + DAC observed. This could be due to unspecific     digestion or the digestion by only one enzyme. Therefore the cloning seems     to be successful and should be further verified by sequencing!
