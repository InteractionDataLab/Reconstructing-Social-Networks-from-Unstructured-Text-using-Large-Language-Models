Test Digest of Clone 12 RBS-GFP-Terminator (see gel 11.07.) with EcoRI
 
Test Digest pipette as follows:
 
1,5µl DNA (~300ng)
0.1µl EcoRI FD
1.5µl FD Buffer
11µl H20
 
àincubation at 37°C for 45 minutes
àAnalysis on 1% gel
 
Gel:
Marker|RBS-GFP-Terminator Clone12
 
The test RD shows only one band indicating a successful cloning procedure. To be sure, the DNA will be used for another transformation hopefully leading to clean clones.
-          the plasmid DNA (RBS-GFP-TermC12) was analyzed on the 1%gel below.
2nd round of RD of DarR and Ribiswitches A-D with new protocol

The Riboswitch constructs shoe strong signals, DarR seems to be very sparsely left over.
 
àThe RDs were purified using the PCR purification kit (500µl PB and elution in 25µl pre-warmed water)
àThe purified DNA was analyzed with nanodrop

Only the first elution of the RD with PstI looks promising. This sample was used for the further, second digest. For time reasons, the EcoRI digest was started in parallel to the 1% gel, that is supposed to confirm the complete digestion of part 7 by PstI. The following picture shows the progress of the digest at 30 additional minutes of RD (see yesterday).
Gel:

The digestion has not been completed, an additional step has to be added in the end.
2nd round of digest:
àpipetted one reaction (40µl) after Katrin Gunkas Über-Protokoll (see yesterday) using EcoRI FD by Thermo Scientific and the FD buffer:
20µl DNA (all that was left)
4µl FD Buffer
4µl EcoRI FD
12µl HPLC H2O
40µl reaction volume
àincubation at 37°C for 30 minutes
àsample put on ice and 3µl loaded on 1% gel.
àgel melted, samples lost
àconsidering the previous experience, the digest was continued with EcoRI. Additionally, to proceed the unfinished digest with PstI, that digest was added to the reaction.
The following things were added to the reaction:
2µl FD Buffer
3µl EcoRI FD
3µl PstI FD
12µl HPLC H2O

Restriction Digest of Part 7 with new Protocol
We now changed the protocol to single digest steps with purification instead of heat-inactivation.
Two digests were prepared, one with PstI and one with EcoRI-HF. For the double digest to be achieved, in a second digest, the products will be digested with the other enzyme, EcoRI-HF or PstI, respectively. This way, we try to find out, whether one enzyme inhibits the other enzyme´s function through its restriction. In the future, we will only need one of the two reactions, either starting PstI, or the other way around.
1st round of digest:
Two reactions were pipetted after Katrin Gunkas “Über-Protocol” as follows:
1: PstI digest
2: EcoRI-HF digest
 
1,5µg DNA (13µl for the isolated Part 7 DNA at 115.6ng/µl)
4µl Buffer (1: 3.1 for PstI / 2: CutSmart for EcoRI-HF)
4µl Enzyme (1: PstI by NEB / 2: EcoRI-HF by NEB)
19µl HPLC H2O
40µl reaction volume
 
àincubation at 37°C for 2h
à3µl on 1% gel to confirm complete digestion, undigested part 7 DNA as control (ATTENTION: Part 7 DNA almost empty)
 
Gel:
marker | uncut Part 7 | PstI RD | EcoRI RD
The EcoRI seems to be done cutting (although signal very low. Discussion: Since Part 7 was almost empty, I had to shake down the tube. This way the used DNA might have been diluted by condensed water, which I shook down). The PstI sample was put back onto the heat block at 37°C for 30 minutes with 3µl Enzyme added.
àpurification of the samples using the PCR purification kit, 500µl (different from protocol) PB buffer, 2x elution with 25µl pre-warmed HPLC water
àstorage at -20°C, “white sticker Ute-Box”
 
ànanodrop measurements have to be done tomorrow
è This R.D. was done using the NEB enzymes from the distribution kits. And all our cloning reactions using PstI did not work! In contrast, the test restriction digests that were done with the Fermentas enzymes EcoRI and PstI worked. Apparently, PstI enzyme from the distribution kit does not cut!
è Test PstI from distribution kit vs. Fermentas enzymes.
If this is true, then we have to prepare part 8 vector (SpeI, PstI cleavage) and GFP-Terminator cassette (XbaI, PstI cleavage) and all our inserts for RiboA, B, C, D and DarR biobrick again! Luckily, the PCR products and the plasmids are all at – 20 °C. So just another R.D. and another gel ex/ PCR clean-up…^^

Pouring of 4 % agarose-1xTAE-gel
1. Set waterbath to 70 °C and place gel chamber directly next to it.
2. Take 500 ml bottle (blue lid), add 4 g agarose and fill up to 100 ml with 1xTAE
3. Heat carefully in microwave (check every 5 – 10 sec if agarose does not … äh… überkochen… and mix by shaking bottle slightly (schwenken…) à Dissolving takes just a 2 – 4 min!
4. As soon as agarose is dissolved (clear solution, but many small bubbles from boiling and shaking making it turbid), place it in the waterbath (lid closed), wait for some time until bubbles are gone
5. Check again if agarose is still dissolved, if not, go back to step 3…

-          Addition of 2.5 µl 5xLD
-          Agarose gel electrophoresis
1%-agarose-1xTAE gel
Loading of 10 µl of C1 RD (well run over…), thus loading of 8 µl of other RD’s
Loading of mixture consisting of 0.5 µl of all uncut plasmids + 3.5 µl dH2O + 1 µl 5xLD as controls
Loading of 3 µl 2 log ladder as a marker
-          Run at 100 V
-          EtBr staining, destaining in water
-          UV detection
