Agarose gel to test all vectors and inserts used for ligation
Transformation
No colonies visible à incubation till evening, possibly clones to slow in growing   because of high Cm concentration?...
 
Agarose gel to test all vectors and inserts used for ligation
1xTAE-1 % agarose gel (from yesterday)
Loaded with at least 30 – 40 ng of each DNA sample supplied with 1 μl of 5x LD
Marker: log-ladder (3 μl)
Run at 100 V in 1xTAE
EtBr staining and destaining
Gel   1:                                                            Gel2
è     For all samples, expected   fragments were detected à no degradation of inserts and vectors

Test of clone growth with different Cm concentrations and Preparation of reactions for sequencing
Test   of clone growth with different chloramphenicol concentrations
-          Both negative control clones   and the clones of pSB1C3 transformation grew on the 5 µg/ml Cm plates, but   not in broth LB medium with 35 µg/ml Cm
-          the other clones (linearized plasmid part 7 and linearized pSB1C3) grew in broth medium and on plates
-          all other clones were able to   grow in broth LB supplied with 35 µg/ml Cm
è     Cm concentration is too low   to apply sufficient selective pressure for selection after transformation
è     Preparation of 10 ml Cm stock   (35 mg/ml à 350 mg in   10 ml) in 70% EtOH (1000x)
è     2x 500 ml LB plates   containing 35 µg/ml
è     Repetition of all ligations and transformation as before using new   plates
 
Preparation   of reactions for sequencing
Plasmids part 1 – part 8; part 2 C1 and   part 2 C2; Plasmids DarRop C1 to C4 and C6
Sequencing: ca. 300 ng plasmid/5 µl
è     For all samples 4 µl plasmid   + 1 µl primer (VR = iGEM_39 or VF2 = iGEM_38) (for some plasmids less than   300 ng plasmid used due to too low concentration);   only samples for part 2 C2 (2.5 µl plasmid) and part 3 (2 µl plasmid), the   plasmid concentration where so high, that they had to be diluted)

è     Tiny colonies on neg. control   plate suggest, that E. coli without plasmid can grow, but poorly. It could be   that the Cm concentration in the plates is too low à 5 µg/ml (as in our plates) are usually used for B. subtilis.   But iGEM webpage recommends 35   µg/ml for selection of E. coli transformants.
è     Alternative: Competent cells   could contain Cm-resistant E. coli
è     Test competent cells
è     Transformation: Actually, the transformation   should be repeated!!!
è     Inoculation of clones from each plate in 4 ml LB containing 35   µg/ml Cm to test which of them are able to grow with such a high selective   pressure à Mini-Prep + streak-out of those that grow
è     Control of plates: streak-out of clones from control reactions on   LB plates with 5 µg/ml and inoculation of the same clones in LB with 35   µg/ml, to verify if they only grow with low Cm concentrations

Gel extraction                                    
-          pour thick garose gel 1% in 1xTAE
-          load marker, uncut plasmid and sample (leave 1 well empty between   sample and marker/uncut plasmid!!!)
(here: 3 µl log ladder, 2.5 µl uncut   plasmid part 6 + 1 µl 5x LD, 50 µl restriction digest of part 6 + 10 µl 5x   LD)
-          run at 80 V in 1xTAE buffer
-          in mean time weigh 2 ml Epi tubes at exact scale (usually ca. 1 g)
-          EtBr staining for 5 min, then destaining briefly in water + quick glance at   Gel doc at normal UV wavelength
-          Cut out bands of expected   size (here: about 900 bp) at UV desk (other room next to 37 °C room…) at UV   light with longer wavelength than normal (less DNA damage) fast
-          Switch off UV desk, cut gel   stripe into smaller fragments and transfer them to the 2 ml tubes
-          Clean outer side of tubes with EtOH
-          Detect gel at Gel doc again   and take a picture (to make sure that nothing of the bands of interest is   left in gel)
 
Gel:
 
Purification   of DNA from gel using Qiagen PCR purification kit:
-          Weigh Epi tubes with gel and calculate weight of gel fragments
-          Add 3 x Volume of QG buffer (in PCR purification kit in Bacillus-Lab) (100 mg gel = 300 µl   of QG buffer)
-          Dissolve gel pieces by   incubating at 50 °C for 10 min in a heating block and by vortexing every 2 – 3 min (if not dissolved after this time, prolong incubation time   until gel is dissolved properly)
-          Transfer 750 µl of the   solution onto the column and centrifuge (13000 rpm, 30 – 60 s, RT), discard flowthrough; repeat this step until all of the solution   is used up
-          Proceed as for normal PCR   purification (wash buffer PE, blank spin, elution with pre-warmed water à my personal recommendation ;P: for elution, use smaller volume than 50   µl; here: 30 µl were used yielding a concentration of 4.6 ng/µl. In total, this corresponds to >150 ng insert compared with 500 ng vector that were initially digested… it seems that one loses much of DNA   during gel extraction!)
-          Measure concentration with NanoDrop (see below)
