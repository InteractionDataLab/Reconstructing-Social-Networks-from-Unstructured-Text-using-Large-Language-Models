KWS SAAT AG, Einbeck
KWS SAAT AG is one of the world's leading plant breeding companies, represented in about 70 countries with 60 subsidiaries, affiliated companies and distributors. The product range contains a broad range of varieties for sugar beet, corn, cereals, oil crops and potatoes. KWS conducted business since 1856 in an independent and sustainable manner. Net sales in the year 2010/11 amounted 855 Mio €, about 75 percent was generated in foreign countries. Currently, about 3,600 employees work for the KWS Group worldwide.
KWS has been breeding crops for temperate climates for more than 150 years. To us, the breeding of plants means understanding and using natural life process for the benefit mankind. With the help of modern crop breeding methods, we continuously increase the yield of our varieties - as well as their resistance to diseases and pests. As a specialist in breeding and seed production, KWS supports farmers in mastering challenges of the future.
Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Faculty of Biology
The faculty of biology represented by Prof. Dr. Martin Göpfert (Dean of faculty) is supporting our iGEM team by paying the registration fee and accrediting the project.  Moreover, the Master program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” (speaker:  Prof. Dr. Volker Lipka) supports our project.
The Göttingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB)
GZMB  is a joint initiative of more than 30 research groups, affiliated with the Faculty of Biology and Psychology, the Medical School (University Medicine), Faculty of Chemistry, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, and the Faculty of Forest Sciences at the Georg August University. All of these research groups work in the field of molecular biology.  The GZMB is represented by  Prof. Dr. Ivo Feußner.
Universitätsmedizin Göttingen (UMG)
The Faculty of Medicine and the University Hospital Göttingen together operate under the umbrella "University Medical Center Göttingen". This structure (integration model) provides the organizational basis for the integration of healthcare, teaching, and research in Göttingen.
The University Medical Center Göttingen has been managed by a three-member Management Board since 01 May 1999, consisting of the divisions Research and Teaching, Healthcare, and Management and Administration.
The University Medical Center Göttingen and the Georg August University Göttingen together form a Foundation under Public Law since 01 January 2003.
Göttingen Genomics Laboratory (G2L)
Microbial genome analysis provides a new research paradigm in the fields of microbiology, molecular genetics, biotechnology and infectious disease biology. Göttingen Genomics Laboratory (G2L) at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics, University of Göttingen, is a major centre of activities in these areas within Germany. G2L was founded in 1997 by Hans-Joachim Fritz and Gerhard Gottschalk with financial support from the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony. Chairman of the laboratory is Rolf Daniel, vice-chairmen are Gerhard Braus and Burkhard Morgenstern. Gerhard Gottschalk is an emeritus professor at the laboratory.
G2L carries out genome analysis projects on the basis of long-term research interests established at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics; these include the biochemistry and molecular biology of microorganisms, extrachromosomal genetic elements, evolution and biodiversity. In addition, G2L plays a pivotal role in various sequencing projects of BMBF funded research projects within the research initiatives GenoMik-Transfer and Medizinische Infektionsgenomik, and it is a centre of cooperations with external research groups.
