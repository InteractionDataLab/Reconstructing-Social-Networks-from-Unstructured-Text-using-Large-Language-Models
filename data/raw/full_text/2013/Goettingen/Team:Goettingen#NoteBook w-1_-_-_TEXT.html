Transformation of DH5α E. coli strain
Transformation of DH5α E. coli strain
Materials   needed:
Liquid   LB medium
LB   agar plates with ampicillin (100 g mL-1)
Procedure:
Put   your liagtion samples on ice, defreeze 200 L of your competent E. coli cells on the top of the ice and add the cells to your ligation samples. Mix   it carefully.
Incubate   the eppendorf reaction tubes for 30 min on ice, transfer the tubes for 90 sec   to 42 oC (heat shock) and put them back for 5 min on ice.
Add   800 L LB medium (without antibiotic) to the cells, and incubate the cells   for 1 hour at 37 oC with agitation.
Add   100 L of the culture onto LB agar plate (containing antibiotic) and spread   them using a spreader.
The   remaining cells are collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and   remove the supernatant leaving 100 L to re-dissolve the pellet.
Plate   this concentrated cells as well (as a backup)
Incubate   the cells overnight at 37 oC
Later,   the plates should be stored at 4 oC
We   did 6 tubes (so, 12 plates)
