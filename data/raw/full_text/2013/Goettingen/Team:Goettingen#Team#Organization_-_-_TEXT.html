Organization Team
In order to get the iGEM project of Team Göttingen 2013 started, an organization team was formed in the beginning of this year. First of all, our main task was to find a proper topic. After endless discussions and brain storming sessions, we saw light appearing at the end of the tunnel. On closer examination, the light turned out to be Green Coli which can be used as an Antibiotic Detector to fight against multi-resistant bacteria. To arm for the battle we found a base at the Department of Microbiology. Furthermore, we designed a booklet by which we managed to attract several sponsors for our mission. In the end we managed to set up everything before the entire iGEM Team could start working.
