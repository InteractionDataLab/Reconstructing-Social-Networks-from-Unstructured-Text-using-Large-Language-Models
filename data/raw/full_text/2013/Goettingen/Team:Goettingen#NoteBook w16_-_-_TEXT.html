Platereader assay of RiboA with c-di-AMP and Polyamine
Platereader assay of RiboA with c-di-AMP and Polyamine
RiboA 5.8.I and CFP CI in BL-21 and a BL-21 wt were inoculated in an ON culture. At 10am a synchronization culture for each was set up with an StartOD of 0.5.
At 11:30am each well of the 96 well plate was inoculated with a start OD of 0.05.
Setup:
RiboA no c-di-AMP no PA
RiboA 10nmol c-di-AMP no PA
RiboA 100nmol  c-di-AMP no PA

Application of some qRTPCR probes onto a gel
in order to see weather different melting temperatures in the qRTPCR make a difference
following probes were used:
83°C: B3, C3, E5
83,5°C: B5, D5, E7

Ribo A-D, Ribo A 5.8.1, A1, 6.1 and P7 minipreps were diluted to a concentration of 25ng/µl and a volume of 10 µl.
Stored in a Eppi-rack at -20°C in the top shelf of the freezer. To be marked for shipment

qRT-PCR together with Katrin G. according to the method collection protocol
10 µl 2X SYBR Green reaction mix (light sensitive)
0.4 µl Reverse Transcriptase
x µl RNA (100ng/20 µl)
x µl H2O
Total 17.6 µl
-          Final reaction (total volume: 20 µl) should contain 100 ng RNA, 10 µl 2x buffer, 0.4 µl enzyme and 1.2 µl of each primer (1:20 diluted in RNase free water)
-          Mastermixes for each RNA sample and a neg. control were prepared. They consisted of2x buffer (light-sensitive – contains SYBRgreen!), RNA/RNase free water for no-template-controls, RNase free water, and enzyme for 3.5 reactions.
-          Mastermixes consisting of 1.2 µl Primer fwd and 1.2 µl Primer reverse per reaction were prepared and then added to 2.4 µl primer mix prepared in the wells of the qRT-PCR plate
-          17.6 µl of the buffer/template/water/enzyme mastermix were added to the wells
-          qRT-PCR run using standard protocol
RFP primers (iGEM_98 and iGEM_99) and rpoA primers (iGEM_102 and iGEM_103) were used

All cultures were synchronised to OD 0.5. After 2,5 h, fresh media was inocculated with a single strain or mixed. For each, one doublicate with IPTG was set up.
Cultures were inocculated to an OD of 0.1. For the mixed cultures, each culture was added to an OD of 0.05. After 3h those ODs were meassured.

From these cultures, a dilution series of 1 cell/µl was set up.
These dilutions were plated onto +/- IPTG + XGal LB plates with 50 cells per half. On one half of the according plate, the premixed cultures were streaked. On the other half, the same mixes were plated from the isolated grown cultures with 25µl (25 cells) per culture. Every single culture was plated seperate as well.
Plates were cultivated at 37°C in the dark over night.
