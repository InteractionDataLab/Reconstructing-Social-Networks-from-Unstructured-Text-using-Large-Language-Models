RNA extraction from E.coli
RNA extraction from E. coli
with kit: Qiagen RNeasy Mini
-          clean bench and pipets with ethanol
-          prepare RLT buffer with 2-mercaptoethanole (1 ml RLT buffer à 10 µl 2-mercaptoethanol); here: for 15 samples, 17 ml RLT buffer were supplied with 170 µl 2-mercaptoethanol (in other Bacillus-lab in the hood)
-          prepare lysis buffer: 1xTE buffer + 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in RNase free water (here: 340 µl 10x TE (sterile) + 85 µl 20 mg/ml lysozyme + 2975 ul RNase free waterà 3.4 ml lysis buffer)
-          set one heating block to 70 °C and pre-heat RNase free water for elution (100 µl for elution of 1 sample)
-          set another heating block to 37 °C for lysis
 
a) Lysis: add 200 µl lysis buffer to E. coli pellet, resuspend properly and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C;add 1 ml RLT supplied with 2-mercaptoethanol to the suspension and centrifuge for 5 min at 13 000 rpm, RT
b) removal of gDNA: load supernatant in 700 µl steps on violet columns and centrifuge at 13 000 rpm, RT, 1 min à collect FLOW-THROUG in 2 ml epi tube (column binds gDNA, but NOT RNA à RNA is in FLOW-THROUG!!!)
c) binding of RNA: add more or less equal volume of 70% ethanol (RNA) (here: 1 ml) to flow-through, mix by pipetting and vortexing, then load mixture on pink columns (pink columns bind RNA)
d) washing: à no, one has to discard the flow-through…
d1) load 700 µl RW1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
d2) load 500 µl RPE1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
d3) load again 500 µl RPE1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
e) drying of column: centrifuge column in emptied collection tube 1 min, 13000 rpm, RT
f) elution: place column in fresh epi tube (RNase-free) elute RNA with 50 µl pre-heated (70°C) RNase-free water, incubate tubes at 70 °C for 5 min, then spin down at 13000rpm for 1 min, RT (here: sample “exp. 8” was eluted with 100 µl by mistake…)
g) measure concentration with NanoDrop (set it to RNA!); Blank: HPLC water (no difference to RNase free water…)
stored at -80°C freezer

Results:
 
Harvesting of cells for qRT-PCR analysis and plate reader assay (promoter clones) of re-trafos from part 1,2,3,4,8 respectively clone 3
-          harvested again cells of over night culture of an OD around between 2-3
 
Promoter characterization: qRT-PCR for RNA isolated from clones 2 (because a mistake happened with the primers – I used primers iGEM_99 and iGEM_100 instead of iGEM_98 and iGEM_99)
-          qRT-PCR with Biorad kit
 
qRT-PCR together with Katrin G. according to the method collection protocol

0.4 µl Reverse Transcriptase
x µl RNA (100ng/20 µl)
x µl H2O
Total 17.6 µl
 
-          Final reaction (total volume: 20 µl) should contain 100 ng RNA, 10 µl 2x buffer, 0.4 µl enzyme and 1.2 µl of each primer (1:20 diluted in RNase free water)
-          Mastermixes for each RNA sample and a neg. control were prepared. They consisted of2x buffer (light-sensitive – contains SYBRgreen!), RNA/RNase free water for no-template-controls, RNase free water, and enzyme for 3.5 reactions.
-          Mastermixes consisting of 1.2 µl Primer fwd and 1.2 µl Primer reverse per reaction were prepared and then added to 2.4 µl primer mix prepared in the wells of the qRT-PCR plate
-          17.6 µl of the buffer/template/water/enzyme mastermix were added to the wells
-          qRT-PCR run using standard protocol
RFP primers (iGEM_98 and iGEM_99) and rpoA primers (iGEM_102 and iGEM_103) were used
