Colonies on LBAmp plates!!!
Transformation of Ligation with GFP-Terminator insert and part 8 backbone worked!!!
No clones on negative control, but very few clones on without insert control. à possibly again incomplete digestion of part 8 (just 20 min) à use 1 h for dig, since reaction for gel ex yesterday seemed to be more completely digested….
Stored at 4 °C
No colonies on LBCm plates
è Further incubation till next morning

Restriction Digest of Parts 1-4 for cloning from 1.7.13 - Run on 4% gel
-          0.5 µl uncut plasmid + 3.5 µl dH2O + 1 µl LD 5x
-          Ca. 40 ng of R.D. of plasmids (= 4 µl) supplied with 1 µl of LD 5x
-          Run at 100 V on 4 %-agarose-1xTAE gel; marker: log ladder (3 µl)
-          EtBr staining, destaining, UV detection
Uncut plasmids visible (between 3 and 8kb, although about 2.5kb big), linearized plasmids visible (between 8 and 10 kb…), promoter fragments not visible at all (should be 30-120bps). Will add picture later.
Discussion:
The thick gel might have unrepresentative effects on large fragments (e.g. plasmids). This thesis is supported by the unreadable marker bands between 3 and 8 kb.
The promoter fragments might just be too small to be stained properly or they are not in the constructs. Only sequencing can solve this riddle…

 Wells as following:
RiboA (C1,C2,C3), RiboB (C1, C2, C3), RiboC (C1), RiboD (C1, C2, C3), lin part7 (C1, C2, C3), DarR (C1, C2, C4), GFP (C1,C2,C4), pSB1C3 (C1, C2, C3)
same order of wells for control
Control:
 
Digested:
è GFP-Terminator construct could be cloned successfully (fragment of slightly > 1 kb corresponding likely to GFP (ca. 900 bp) and terminator (ca. 170 bp) visible)
è Clones derived from transformation of linearzised part 7 contain apparently plasmid with part 7 (terminator) à ca. 200 bp fragment visible after digest, corresponding presumably to terminator à clones result possibly from transformation of not linearized plasmids present after incomplete digest of part 7
è For C2 of RiboB cloning, a weak band at ca. 200 bp could be detected, that does not fit with the expected insert of 370 bp à something else got cloned…
è For transformations of ligation reactions containing linearized pSB1C3 as a vector, no transformants containing the desired inserts could be obtained à plasmid that was transformed could be one of the residual template plasmids containing Promoter-RBS-RFP-Terminator (ca. 1.5 kb): after R.D., bands at 1.5 kb and 2 kb corresponding to the expected fragments could be detected. However, band at 1.5 kb is very weak, and for uncut plasmids, a strong band at this height representing the supercoiled plasmid could be detected à it’s also possible that pSB1C3 can’t be restricted properly… anyway, linearized pSB1C3 seems not to work for cloning à cut out terminator from part 7, extract backbone (= linearized pSB1C3) and use it for cloning of Ribo- and DarR biobricks instead…
Sequencing data arrived!
àNo biobrick in the DarR operator construct!
