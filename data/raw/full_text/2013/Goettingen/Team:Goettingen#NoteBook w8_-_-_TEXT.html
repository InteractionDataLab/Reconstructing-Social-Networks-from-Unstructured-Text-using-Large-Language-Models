Of   each sample, 25 ml were harvested and collected in a falcon tube with   previously filled 15 ml killing buffer, which was frozen over night with a   big surface. The falcon was subsequently mixed by hand until the killing   buffer thawed completely. Then, 5 min 8500 rpm 4°C, discard supernatant and   freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80°C. These are the samples used for the   microarray.
For   additional c-di-AMP quantification also harvest 10 ml of each sample in a 15   ml falcon tube. Snap freeze and store at -80°C.
For   exact protein determination harvest also 2x1 ml of each sample in a 2 ml   eppi. Centrifuge, discard supernatant and store at -20°C.

Promoter-GFP Clonation
Promoter-GFP Clonation
Photos of the plates with Promoter-GFP in pSB1C3:
GFP:
Through light:
a lot of positive clones, but also negative ones.
-> 8 positive clones were picked and inoculated into 4ml Cam cultures for minipreps tomorrow
-> Since there was no religation control on any plates made by Bingyao, I could not check the vector without the Promoter for GFP. The green cultures could therefore also be religated vectors expressing GFP without the Promoter. Sequencing will show us what is in there.
->KEEP IN MIND: ALLWAYS DO A RELIGATION CONTROL AND TRANSFORM IT WITH THE OTHER LIGATIONS!

DarR PCR, Ligation Part 6 + Part 3, Ligation of Part 7 + 40/41 Riboswitch and Part 7 + DarR, Continue the Restriction yesterday-Part 8 with PstI
DarR PCR
 
-          DarR fusion PCR
-          After PCR cleanup, yield way to low. maybe mistake somewhere. Repeated on 24.7
Ligation Part 6 + Part 3
 
-          Setup: 5 µl Part 6 (9,8 µl/ng), 10 µl Part 3 (23,5 µl/ng), 2 µl Buffer, 1 µl T4 Ligase, 2 µl H2O
-          Overnight ligation 16°C
→transformation done by Bingyao next day
 
Ligation of Part 7 + 40/41 Riboswitch and Part 7 + DarR
-          Due to low concentrations of Backbone and insert, ligation was set up in 20 µl and with only 20 ng of BB.
-          both ligations with 2 setups. 5 µl and 10 µl of insert
-          re-ligation done
-          overnight ligation 16°C
→transformation done by Bingyao next day
Inocculation of Cryostocks
-          Parts 1-4 and Part 7 inocculated in 4x4ml LB + Antibiotics overnight
Continue the Restriction yesterday-Part 8 with PstI
Add 2 additional SpeI into the system and digest another 1 hour, most DNA is cut. <--continue the uncomplete first round digestion(SpeI)
The second round of part8 digestion with fast PstI:
Add 4ul PstI into the system
Digest 2hours.
Dephosphorylation
    Add 2ul of fast AP into the system(fast AP is compatible with FD buffer)
    Reaction on 37 degree, 30min
Purification with PCR clean up kit
    Final concentration : on the tube, about 28ng/ul;

The first round of part8 digestion with SpeI: to have linearized structure for DarR ORF into Part8, Restriction digestion of part 7
Innoculate ON culture for plasmid mini-prep
Part7 C1
RBS-GFP-Term construct C1,C4,C5
Test restriction of plasmid RBS-GFP-Term:
C2 as control, C1,C4,C5
 --->the Part6 already has the RBS and Term.
 [that simply makes the work above meaningless]
For the construct of  RBS-DarR ORF-Term construct (expression construct)
DarR ORF into Part8(PBS plasmid)
     suffix insertion { cut part8 with SpeI and PstI, and the DarR ORF with XbalI and PstI }
RBS-DarR ORF into part7(Term plasmid)
     Prefix insertion {cut part7 with EcoRI and XbaI, the RBS-DarR ORF with EcoRI and SpeI)
 
The first round of part8 digestion with SpeI: to have linearized structure for DarR ORF into Part8
        Fast SpeI: 4ul
        FD buffer : 4ul
        part8 DNA: 1.5ug
        Water: fill up to 40ul
Digestion:1.5 hour, not fully digested
        Stored at -20 overnight
          tbc
Restriction digestion of part 7
-          template from stock
-          restriction with EcoRI and PstI FD, gel extraction to remove terminator out of the construct
-          Nanodrop meassurment 5,3 ng/µl
-          Inocculation from cryostock. 5h, only 2h on the shaker (stupid me). Yield after miniprep way to low (10x 50 µl with 1-3 ng/µl)
-          →redone on 23.7 overnight inocculation
