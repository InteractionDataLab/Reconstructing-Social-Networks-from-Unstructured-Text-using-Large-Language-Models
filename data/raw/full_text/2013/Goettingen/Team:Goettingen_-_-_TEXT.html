Project
Our project relates to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. In order to fight this, we built a screening system targeting c-di-AMP (signaling molecule in Gram-positive bacteria). In other words: We developed an “Antibiotic Detector”!

Team
Our team consists of 12 ambitious and dedicated master students from the Georg-August University of Göttingen. We love biology, we care about the world, and of course we are super hot.

Fun
We are the ones who know how to have fun when PCRs don’t work, when proteins refuse to be expressed, when gels are a total mess and when the deadline is just about to hit us.

Outreach
