BMBF Congress in Berlin
In May 2013 the iGEM-Team Göttingen received an invitation from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to join the Strategy Congress “Next generation of biotechnological techniques - Biotechnology 2020+” in Berlin.

This strategy process brings experts of biotechnology and engineering together since 2010 to discuss methods and applications that will shape biotechnology from 2020 on.
Organizers of this congress were also very dedicated to support the exchange of experiences and networking between current German iGEM-Teams.
Therefore, 6 members of our team made their way to Berlin on June 26th. In their baggage: the first version of our poster and a huge anticipation to meet other iGEM-Teams and to present our project.
At the congress our representatives were able to listen to interesting presentations and to discuss our project with congress participants and fellow iGEM-Teams. Opinions and solution proposals for common challenges of the daily lab work, BioBrick handling and organizational aspects related to the iGEM-contest were exchanged.
We were also lucky to meet Prof. Herbert Jäckle from the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. Having discussed our project, he was very interested and offered his help in attracting more sponsors.
In the evening all iGEM-Teams met at the landmark of the capital, the Brandenburger Tor, to explore the nightlife and to bring this exciting and inspiring day to an end with a few cold drinks.
We’re looking forward to seeing you all in Lyon on October 11th!
