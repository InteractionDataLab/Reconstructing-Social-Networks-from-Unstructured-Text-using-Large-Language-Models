Acknowledgement
We want to thank all of the following for their great contribution to our project. Without their help the project wouldn’t have been such a success.
Dr. Achim Dickmanns
Achim Dickmanns is a member Prof. Dr. R. Ficners group in the Structural Biochemical Department of the Göttingen University. He performed the high-throughput crystallization assays, which was a really great help for us. Moreover, he refined the crystallization conditions in order to get crystals that are suitable for elucidating the 3D structure of our protein.

Dr. Piotr Neumann
Piotr Neumann also works in the group of Prof. Dr. R. Ficner. Based on the diffraction pattern, Dr. Neumann calculated the 3D structure of the Listeria DacA protein. He did an excellent job!
