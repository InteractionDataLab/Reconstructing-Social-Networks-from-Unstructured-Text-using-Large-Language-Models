Competition Experiment of DAC cells and RiboA C5.8:, MiniPrep of DarR reporter system clones , est restriction digest of DarR reporter system clones + gel run, Primer design and ordering (Hybridization oligos) ....
Cryostocks of CFP Religation controls Clones 1 and 2
Cryostocks of RiboA C5.8 Retrafo
Clones: 5.8.1 – 5.8.5
Glycerin Stocks of CFP Religation Controls Clones 1 and 2
Prepared inoculated 4mL cultures with Cm for RiboA Retrafo Clones 1-5 and the CFP Religation Clones for minipreps and Sequencing
Competition Experiment of DAC cells and RiboA C5.8:
After inoculation of a Synchronization culture (both inoculated at OD=0,5 after one hour DACod=1,7, RiboAod=0,8) the experiment was stopped, because the DAC cells would overgrow the RiboA cells. They were supposed to be inoculated into a IPTG+ AB- main culture together (each OD=0,05 so together OD=0,1), let grow until OD=2 and plated out (on IPTG+ AB- X-Gal+) to check whether the different cells could be cultured together for experiments. 
-MONDAY: CLONING OF RIBOA INTO THE SAME “STEM” AS DAC cells because the XL Blue cells grow much slower.
Re-Trafo Promoter Parts 
plates:
-          neg. control: no colonies on 50 µl plate, nor on rest-plate (except for a small contamination at rim of agar/petri dish)
-          Part 1 C1 plasmid: many colonies on 50 µl plate, rest-plate more or less overgrown with E. coli
-          Part 2 C2 plasmid: many colonies on 50 µl plate, rest-plate more or less overgrown with E. coli
-          Part 3 C1 plasmid: many colonies on 50 µl plate, rest-plate more or less overgrown with E. coli (except for a small contamination)
-          Part 4 C1 plasmid: many colonies on 50 µl plate, rest-plate more or less overgrown with E. coli
-          Part 8 C1 plasmid: many colonies on 50 µl plate, rest-plate more or less overgrown with E. coli 
→ picking of 2 clones each and streak-out on LBAmp, incubation at 37 °C
→ transformation plates stored at 4 °C, big fridge
MiniPrep of DarR reporter system clones 
-          shaker were turned off in the morning à probably, they weren’t running over night à cultures grew poorly (other explanations: a) inoculation was done with low amounts of cells, since master plate didn’t grow fully over day; b) big plasmid c) all explanations apply…^^)
-          streak out on LBCm plates to prepare fresh Back-up plates
-          only few cells for MiniPrep
-          MiniPrep done as usual with NucleoSpin kit
-          elution only with 30 µl (pre-warmed) HPLC water, incubation for 5 min at 50 °C
-          NanoDrop concentration measurement:
Test restriction digest of DarR reporter system clones + gel run
-          test RD with EcoRI and PstI à for one reaction:
-          1 µl PstI FD
-          1 µl EcoRI FD
-          1 µl FD Green buffer 10x
-          4 µl plasmid solution (ca. 150 – 300 ng)
-          3 µl dH2O
-          in total: 10 µl
 
-          preparation of MasterMix for 11 reactions:
-          11 µl PstI FD
-          11 µl EcoRI FD
-          11 µl FD Green buffer 10x
-          33 µl dH2O
-          in total: 66 µl à 6 µl were added to 4 µl plasmid solution (concentrations: see above) prepared in epi tubes
-          incubation for 1 h at 37 °C 
Gel run:
-          2x 1 % agarose-1xTAE gel
-          loading of 3 µl 2 log ladder as a marker
-          loading of 1 µl uncut plasmid + 3 µl dH2O + 1 µl 5x LD
-          loading of 5 µl RD reaction
-          run at 100 V
-          EtBr staining + destaining

Harvesting of cells for qRT-PCR (promoter characterization), RNA extraction from E. coli, Re-transformation of Promoter and RBS Part plasmids , Colony PCR for DarR reporter system clones...
Harvesting of cells for qRT-PCR (promoter characterization)
measurement of OD600nm again
-          harvesting of another 1 ml sample (OD600nm= 2.42 to 2.91), as described on 28.8.13
-          calculation of growth curves → see excel sheet in dropbox or department server folder
RNA extraction from E. coli
with kit: Qiagen RNeasy® Plus Mini Kit
-          clean bench and pipets with ethanol
-          prepare RLT buffer with 2-mercaptoethanole (1 ml RLT buffer → 10 µl 2-mercaptoethanol); here: for 18 samples, 20 ml RLT buffer were supplied with 200 µl 2-mercaptoethanol (in other Bacillus-lab in the hood)
-          prepare lysis buffer: 1xTE buffer + 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in RNase free water (here: 400 µl 10x TE (sterile) + 100 µl 20 mg/ml lysozyme + 3.5 ml RNase free water→ 4 ml lysis buffer)
-          set one heating block to 70 °C and pre-heat RNase free water for elution (100 µl for elution of 1 sample)
-          set another heating block to 37 °C for lysis
a) Lysis: add 200 µl lysis buffer to E. coli pellet, resuspend properly and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C;add 1 ml RLT supplied with 2-mercaptoethanol to the suspension and centrifuge for 5 min at 13 000 rpm, RT (I made a mistake and loaded the mixture directly on the gDNA columns (for all exponential phase and for all stationary phase samples except P8 C1 → so I pipetted everything back into the remaining mixture (some solution has also passed the membrane, I pipetted this part back, as well) and centrifuged, then I loaded new columns with the supernatant after centrifugation…)
b) removal of gDNA: load supernatant in 700 µl steps on violet columns and centrifuge at 13 000 rpm, RT, 1 min→ collect FLOW-THROUG in 2 ml epi tube (column binds gDNA, but NOT RNA → RNA is in FLOW-THROUG!!!)
c) binding of RNA: add more or less equal volume (here: 1 ml) 70 % EtOH (cooled) to flow-through, mix by pipetting and vortexing, then load 700 µl of mixture on pink columns (pink columns bind RNA), centrifuge 1 min, RT, 13 000 rpm, discard flow-through; repeat loading + centrifuging until the whole mixture is used up
d) washing: → now, one has to discard the flow-through…
d1) load 700 µl RW1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
d2) load 500 µl RPE1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
d3) load again 500 µl RPE1 buffer onto column, centrifuge at 13000 rpm, RT, 1 min
e) drying of column: centrifuge column in emptied collection tube 1 min, 13000 rpm, RT
f) elution: place column in fresh epi tube (RNase-free) elute RNA with 50 µl pre-heated (70°C) RNase-free water, incubate tubes at 70 °C for 5 min, then spin down at 13000rpm for 1 min, RT (here: sample “exp. 8” was eluted with 100 µl by mistake…)
g) measure concentration with NanoDrop (set it to RNA!); Blank: HPLC water (no difference to RNase free water…)
NanoDrop concentrations from today:
Abbreviations: exp. = exponential phase (sample taken at OD600nm= ca. 0.6); stat. = stationary phase (sample taken at OD600nm> 2); ON = sample taken after ON incubation (OD600nm> 2); 1 = Part 1 C1; 2-1 = Part 2 C1; 2-2 = Part 2 C2; 3 = Part 3; 4 = Part 4; 8 = Part 8
→ or ON samples, a peak at ca. 225 nm was observed
→ in general the A260nm/A280nm seem to be quite low…
samples stored at -80 °C in green plastic box
Re-transformation of Promoter and RBS Part plasmids 
-          for characterization, 3 biological replicates should be done
-          so far, with P1 C1, P2 C1 and C2, P3 C1 and P4 C1 and P8 C1, we have one biological replicate. The plasmids from the “proper” clones (not P2 C1 plasmid!) will be re-transformed into DH5α and 2 clones will be picked and further analyzed.
plasmid solutions used:
Part 1 C1 plasmid (84.6 ng/µl), 7.6.13
Part 2 C2 plasmid (120.6 ng/µl)
Part 3 C1 plasmid (151.0 ng/µl), 7.6.13
Part 4 C1 plasmid, 2.7.13
Part 8 C1 plasmid (113.9 ng/µl), 11.7.13
-          1 µl plasmid solution was added to DH5α comp. cells, then transformation was done according to methods-folder-protocol
-          a neg. control was included (1 µl sterile dH2O added to comp. cells)
-          500 µl supernatant were removed after centrifugation
-          plating on LBAmp plates and incubation at 37 °C
Colony PCR for DarR reporter system clones
Transformation from 28.8.13:
neg. control: no colonies on 50 µl plate, nor on rest-plate
w/o insert control: no colonies on 50 µl plate, but 1 or 2 on rest-plate → bigger one picked for Colony PCR, since regarding the smaller one, I was not sure if it was really a clone or a bubble…; inoculation of purple Colony PCR tube (termed R)
with A or B insert: no colonies on 50 µl plate, but several on rest-plate  → 12 clones picked each for Colony PCR: A → blue PCR tubes; B → green PCR tubes, termed 1 – 12
Colony PCR:
-          colony PCR was done as described previously (10.7.13)
-          an additional control was used: plasmid DarRrev-Termrev C3 plasmid, which was digested to generate the vector (plasmid solution form 23.8.13, 229.7 ng/µl, dilution 1:25 → ca. 9 ng/µl), yellow PCR tube, termed P
-          primers: iGEM_38 (VF2) and iGEM_39 (VR)
-          30x MasterMix prepared, distribution of 15 μl to 26 tubes, addition of 1 μl plasmid dilution or inoculation with clones after streak-out on master plates → master plates incubated over day at 37 °C
-          protocol: elongation time increased to 4:30 min, since almost 2 kb insert in positive clones
Gel run for Colony PCR (by Katrin G.) 
-          2x 1% agarose-1xTAE gel
-          addition of 5 µl 5x LD to 25 µl PCR reaction
-          loading of 5 µl on gel
-          loading of 3 µl 2 log ladder as a marker
-          run
-          EtBr staining + destaining in water
-          UV detection
Gel 1 for DarR reporter system A:
Loading: Marker/ DarRrev-Termrev C3 plasmid/Re-ligand/C1/C2/C3/C4/C5/C6/C7/C8/C9/C10/C11/C12/Marker
Gel 2 for DarR reporter system B:
Loading: Marker/C1/C2/C3/C4/C5/C6/C7/C8/C9/C10/C11/C12/ DarRrev-Termrev C3 plasmid/ Re-ligand/Marker
→ The expected band of ca. 2 kb is not seen, but the band of re-ligated vectors was observed for re-ligand and plasmid control (> 1 kb, as expected) and also for B C5→ since this band is not seen for all other clones, but no 2 kb and since there are bands at smaller bp  which are not observed for the re-ligand, it could be that the elongation time was still too short/that Taq hat some problem to amplify insert of positive clones → all clones w/o re-ligand band could be considered as positive clones → inoculation of A C1 – C5 and B C1 – C4 and C6 for MiniPrep and TestRD, to see if they are really positive clones.
Reactions thrown away
-          plates stored at 4 °C (big fridge)
Inoculation
-          Inoculation of DarR reporter system clones A C1 – C5 and B C1 – C4 and B C6 in 4 ml LBCm (from master plates)
-          Incubation ON at 37 °C, 200 rpm
-          Plates stored at 4°C, big fridge
Plate reader assay (characterization of promoter clones)
-          plate reader stopped
-          data analysis… (see excel sheet in dropbox/department server) 
-          For the growth curves, the mean of the OD600nm values from the technical replicates was calculated. The error bars indicate the standard deviation.
-          For the RFP/OD600nm curves, the RFP values (in RFU) were normalized to OD600nm. The mean was calculated using the normalized values from the technical replicates. The error bars indicate the standard deviation.
-          RFP fluorescence had large errors during initial log phase (ca. 0 – 3 h) and, for P3 and P4, during remaining log phase and stationary phase, but OD600nm not
-          cells showed logarithmic growth in first 5 h, then, growth curve flattened indicating that stationary phase was reached; over the time, cell amount seemed to decrease slightly
-          in the beginning (first 3 h (up to 5h) of incubation, exponential growth phase), the values for normalized RFP fluorescence varied strongly; this might be caused by the low OD600nm(https://2012.igem.org/Team:LMU-Munich/Data/Anderson). During late log phase/beginning of stationary phase at ca. 6 – 7 h, the fluorescence increased suddenly and strongly à fluorophores of RFP might need oxygen for maturation/formation à during log phase, cells grew strongly and might have used oxygen necessary for RFP maturation/fluorescence. During stationary growth, the fluorescence is relatively constant correlating with the constant OD600nm.
-          P1 C1, P2 C2, P3 C1 and P4 C1 seemed to differ significantly from empty-vector control P8 C1 regarding RFP fluorescence: the RFP fluorescence was higher during stationary phase for all promoters. àRFP seemed to have been expressed and matured in higher amounts for Promoter 1, 2, 3 and 4 during stationary phase.
-          relative strength of promoters: Promoter 1< Promoter2<<Promoter 4 < Promoter 3
-          P2 C1 did not differ significantly from empty-vector control P8 C1à P2 C1 possibly does not contain RFP/ Promoter.
“Drop”-Experiment: Photographs taken
Pictures:
RiboA on Gp1013 without (left), and with (right) IPTG
RiboA on p172 without (left) and with (right) IPTG
Results/Discussion:
There are no visible differences between the controls and the RiboA on top of induced (and therefore cdiAMP-producing) cells.
Also, the cells in the agar are not really homogenously distributed but grow in clones. The holes in the fluorescent clones seem to be clones of the cells, which are supposed to be inside the plates. The next plates need to be made with a new protocol addressing this problem.
Reinocculated the CFP-religation clones, the DAC, and the Empty Vector clone
Procedures with these clones for tomorrow:
CFP-Religation C1 and C2:

Sequencing results from 23.8.13, Restriction digests, Purification of vectors from today by PCR clean-up after first round of digest, Purification of part 6.4 A/B inserts by gel extraction....
Sequencing results from 23.8.13
9 – DarRrev-Termrev C2 + VF2→ DarRrev and Terminatorrev are inserted in the plasmid in the desired orientation without mutations
10 – DarRrev-Termrev C2 + VR→ DarRrev and Terminatorrev are inserted in the plasmid in the desired orientation without mutations
11 – DarRrev-Termrev C3 + VF2→ DarRrev and Terminatorrev are inserted in the plasmid in the desired orientation without mutations
12  - DarRrev-Termrev C3 + VR→ DarRrev and Terminatorrev are inserted in the plasmid in the desired orientation without mutations
13 – part6.4 B C2 + VF2→ RBSrev is inserted in the desired orientation, but sequencing stopped again in reverse promoter 3
14 – part 6.4 B C5 + VF2→ RBSrev is inserted in the desired orientation, but sequencing stopped again in reverse promoter 3
15 – part 6.4 A C2 + VF2 → RBSrev is not inserted
16 – part 6.4 A C3 + VF2→ RBSrev is inserted in the desired orientation, but a part of pSB1C3 is missing at the EcoRI restriction site (but EcoRI restriction site is present) and a G of NotI restriction site in prefix is missing…
17 - part 6.4 A C5 + VF2→ RBSrev is not inserted
18 – part 6.4 A C8 + VF2→ RBSrev is not inserted 
Plan:  sequencing of the other 4 part 6.4 A clones and cutting out of part 6.4 A C3 insert with XbaI and PstI (one would get rid of missing/erroneous regions) and integration in vector DarRrev-Termrev plasmid C3; same for part 6.4 B C2
Plates for C1 – C3 of parts 1 – 4
-          today, the part 2 clones C2 and C3 are slightly pink, while C1 is white as C1 and C2 of part 1 (C3 of part 1 never existed…)
-          clones of part 3 and part 4 are very pink
-          pictures were taken:
Restriction digests
a) DarRrev-Termrev in pSB1C3; C3 with EcoRI and SpeI 
3 μl SpeI FD
3 μl EcoRI FD
4 μl FD buffer 10x
7 μl plasmid (229.7 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng)
23 μl dH2O
in total: 40 μl
 
b) part 6.4 A C3 and part 6.4 B C2 with EcoRI
4μl EcoRI FD
4 μl FD buffer 10x
15μl plasmid (6.4 A: 107.5 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng; 6.4 B: 114.6 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng)
17μl dH2O
in total: 40 μl
Cloning strategy changed -  suddenly new idea occurred to Katrin and me: sequencing of the other 4 part 6.4 A clones and cutting out of part 6.4 A C3 insert with XbaI and PstI and integration in vector DarRrev-Termrev plasmid C3; same for part 6.4 B C2; but to avoid a waste of material, the above mentioned reactions were incubated as well and stored at – 20°C in DarR box (in addition, they can serve as a control for part 6.4A, to see, if EcoRI site is really there!)
 
c) DarRrev-Termrev in pSB1C3; C3 with SpeI
4μl SpeI FD
4 μl FD buffer 10x
7 μl plasmid (229.7 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng)
25μl dH2O
in total: 40 μl
 
d) part 6.4 A C3 and part 6.4 B C2 with XbaI and PstI
3μl PstI FD
3 μl XbaI FD
4 μl FD buffer 10x
15μl plasmid (6.4 A: 107.5 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng; 6.4 B: 114.6 ng/μl, purified on 23.8.13 → ca. 1500 ng)
15μl dH2O
in total: 40 μl
 
→ all reactions incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C (incubation time decreased since missing part of vector in plasmid part 6.4 A C3 might result from EcoRI FD overdigest within 2 h incubation time…)
