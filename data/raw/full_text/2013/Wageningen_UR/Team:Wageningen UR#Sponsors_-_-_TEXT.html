Sponsors and acknowledgements
Our project would not have been possible without the generous help from several sponsors. In order to thank them for their support, we have included them in the lower banner of our wiki, on our posters and presentations throughout our entire project.  Furthermore, we have received support from Wageningen AlumniGEM students and others, who provided us with valuable comments and discussions. These include: Brendan Ryback, Kees van der Ark, Robert Nitschel, Paulien Poelarents, Nico Claassens, Daan van Vliet, Philip Puylaert, Ruud Spruijt, Bastian Hornung, Rico Hagelaar, Sander Rodenburg and the lab members of the Laboratory of Systems and Synthetic Biology as well as the Laboratory of Microbiology at Wageningen University.
