Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry
info
The pkiA promoter is a constitutive promoter used for Aspergillus niger.
The xlnD terminator is a terminator used for Aspergillus niger.
A codon optimized ATP bio-sensor used in Aspergillus niger.
A codon optimized pH bio-sensor used in Aspergillus niger
A codon optimized eforRed chromoprotein for use in Aspergillus niger
A ketosynthase domain part of a polyketide synthase (lovB) optimized for Aspergillus niger
A malonyl CoA: ACP Acyl transferase domain part of a polyketide synthase (LovB) optimized for Aspergillus niger
Silver medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
info
The pkiA promoter has successfully been used to express the ATP bio-sensor
The xlnD terminator has successfully been used for the ATP bio-sensor
Even though the Actin-GFP fusion did work very well within Aspergillus niger due to an illegal restriction site we were not able to submit it.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
info
The pkiA promoter has successfully been used to express the ATP bio-sensor
The xlnD terminator has successfully been used for the ATP bio-sensor
The codon optimized eforRed has successfully been used attached to a mitochondrial signal peptide and has given a red color to the mycellium of Aspergillus niger
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project
info
A material transfer agreement (MTA) is made to formalize the exchange of biological parts like cell-lines, plasmids and reagents and protect the rights of all the parties involved.
Gold medal
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, enter this information in the Registry, create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry
info
the codon optimized eforRed has successfully been used attached to a mitochondrial signal peptide and has given a red color to the mycellium of Aspergillus niger
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system
info
We have received a geneticin resistance gene from Cornell to test it for Aspergillus niger
We also organized and participated in the IGEM Netherlands
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use
info
Last year, Paulien Poelarends studied the communication of IGEM teams with the public. The knowledge she obtained was combined into a workshop What can we, as IGEM members, learn from our own conversations with the public to improve the dialogue between the science and society. This is an introspective approach to human practice that will let us learn how to communicate with public instead of having a one-way conversation about synthetic biology.
The knowledge we obtained was also applied  to the Science cafe, an evening where the public was invited to discuss with experts about synthetic biology.
