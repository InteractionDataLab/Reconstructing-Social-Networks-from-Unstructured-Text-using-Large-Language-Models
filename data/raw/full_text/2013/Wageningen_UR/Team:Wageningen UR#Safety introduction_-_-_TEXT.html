Safety of the application
Fungal secondary metabolites are important sources for the discovery of novel drugs due to their pharmacological properties. The production of secondary metabolites in most cases involves a big enzyme that contains multiple catalytic domains. We aim to use a synthetic approach by modulating each domain separately, and generate a plethora of new compounds that have a tremendous potential in saving human lives. The production of lovastatin has been chosen as a proof of concept. Our end product is non-replicative and contains no genetic material.
As it is known, Synthetic Biology is an interesting and promising scientific field. Nonetheless, it is still subject to inherent hazards which may affect the researchers, the public and the environment. Therefore, it is crucially important for anyone working in this field to thoroughly be aware of these dangers and take the necessary precautions to minimize any risks that might occur. This page will provide an overview of the issues related to biological safety and security concerning iGEM 2013 by providing answers to several key safety questions.
iGEM Safety Questions
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety
No, our project ideas pose no substantial risk to either researchers, the public or the environment. In this project, all the organisms including E. coli and Aspergillus niger strains belong to Bio-safety level 1. They are non-pathogenic, commercially available and lab-safe. All members of our team have been trained in both Good Microbiological Techniques and general and specific lab safety. Besides, the existing biological parts we used do not raise any foreseeable safety issues, neither do the parts we introduced ourselves. (see Fungi-related safety ).

2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues? If yes,
Did you document these issues in the Registry?
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your experience?
No, none of the BioBrick parts or devices we made this year would raise safety issues. We produced secondary metabolites with the industrial 'workhorse' Aspergillus niger. Since Aspergillus niger is good at protein secretion, toleration of acidic environment and ‘generally regarded as safe’ (GRAS), it is being introduced into iGEM as a novel chassis. Our main goal project is based on a multilevel approach by engineering parts, devices and our host. All of them are considered to be safe.

3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Yes, Wageningen UR has its own biosafety rules next to the national biosafety regulations. Its rules can be found on laboratory safety page. Our laboratory and techniques all comply with the European Directive on the contained use of micro-organisms . Also it is approved by the Biosafety officer. All in all, the project is in compliance with national regulations and university requirements.

4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Yes. We suggest to increase the safety awareness of iGEMers, it is necessary to give safety lectures to explain general safety issues, even including a instead of the first aid course. It is compulsory to submit the safety related items to lab instructors for approval before starting to work in the lab. To specify a system for identifying the hazards associated with materials, it is meaningful to include the National Fire Code from the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA).

5.Have you thought about safety issues related to possible end applications of your product?
Yes. Lovastatin is our end product which is non-replicative and contains no genetic material. Nevertheless, anything that is going to be used as medicine compounds will first have to undergo rigorous clinical trials.
