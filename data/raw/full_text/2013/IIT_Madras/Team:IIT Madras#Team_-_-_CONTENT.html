          The man behind the idea. A devoted biologist and a staunch meat eater, we are not surprised that he wanted to eliminate all toxins from his precious food. His life works in a binary system-food and sleep. Once in a while, the system crashes and you can see him make an appearance in the lab. When he is not luring others into mischief, you can find him immersed in research papers, carefully fine-tuning our solutions. He is (in)famous among professors for his brilliant attendance record. On occasions when he does attend classes, he manages to puzzle everyone, more so because of his jabber than his intricate questions. &quot;WeCanNeutraliseShigaToxin&quot; were his first inspiring (read incomprehensible) 'words' to our team. A reward of 100$ to anyone who can decipher his ramble in the first go.
        </P><P>
          Mitan is a 4th year Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology. His research interest lies in immunology and cancer biology. YouCanHearHimBlabberAt msmitans4@gmail.com. Beware! Don't steal his food. If you do, he will look for you, he will find you and he will kill you.

          Our team has had a long distance relationship with Namit when he had been whisked away by
          
          NTU, Singapore on an exchange program. We went through occasional rough patches but eventually 
          
          made it through when Namit promised to spy on other iGEM teams for us. He seems to have a strong 
          
          aversion to clothes and we wouldn't be too surprised if he dresses up in a sweaty shirt and skimpy 
          
          shorts for a professional meeting. Ironically, he is as round as a drum but calls everyone else fat. In his 
          
          free time, he tries to give ‘life advices' to whoever would listen to him.This is the time everybody claims 
          
          that they have work to do and the lab becomes suspiciously empty. Don't get us wrong- he is perfectly 
          
          capable of handing out some great advice. With prior experience and exposure to lab techniques, he 
          
          leads the team ahead.

          Throw a random quizzing question at him and he will answer it for you. He could be wrong, but
          
          he has an ability to convince you the other way. His ability to fall asleep anywhere, anytime is
          
          quite the envy of the other team-mates who haven't been bestowed with such a priceless talent. A lot 
          
          of freshers are seen asking him for tips on how one can fall asleep. Open mouthed. In the first row. Right 
          
          under the professor's stern eye. When he is not asleep in the weirdest of places, he is molesting Mitan 
          
          or pranking some other team member . Either that, or he is helping out all the sections of lab work.

          Meet the kid of the team. Technically, Nandita should be junior to everyone else on the team,
          
          but she isn't. She says she was so smart in her school that they decided to promote her to an advanced

          and just skipped a year. But don't make the mistake of making fun of her ‘tender age.' She is quite feisty 
          
          and wouldn't hesitate to give you a whack or two.

          She has a very sharp brain – so sharp that it extracts a double meaning out of almost every 
          
          straightforward sentence! If you hear her giggle in the midst of a serious discussion, you can be sure that 
          
          the &quot;Mother of Double Entendres&quot; has struck again! She is quite multi-talented as well – strumming a 
          
          guitar, sketching a portrait, attempting to play football, writing cryptic codes in MATLAB – she does it all.

          Biology and hopes to pursue it in the quest of establishing protein networks and modeling their 
          
          interactions. Feel free to amuse the kid with a lollypop at nandita94@gmail.com. Wait, you can surely 
          
          hear her giggle now.

          If you want to know the trick of getting into a team - any team - anytime, then you have to take pointers from this guy. He possesses some super-valuable skills - the ones that poor teams like ours desperately want. And we didnt even have to bribe him with a guaranteed flight ticket to Hong Kong or a years supply of Coke! He was kind enough to come to our rescue without asking for much. He didnt even ask for this Bio, but this is the cheapest thing we can do for him, so we will do it! Junaid has single-handedly designed our entire Wiki page. We give him content and he makes a web page out of it! He is a real wizard. Also he seems to be totally not interested in biology.
