The lab is confirmed to the standards for a bio-safety 1 lab according to the <B>Center for Disease Control and Prevention,Atlanta</B>. <B>Bio-safety Level 1</B> is suitable for work involving well-characterized agents not known to consistently cause disease in immunocompetent adult humans, and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. <B>BSL-1</B> laboratories are not necessarily separated from the general traffic patterns in the building. Work is typically conducted on open bench tops using standard microbiological practices. Special containment equipment or facility design is not required, but may be used as determined by appropriate risk assessment techniques. Laboratory personnel must have specific training in the procedures conducted in the laboratory and must be supervised by a scientist with training in microbiology or a related science.</P><TABLE id="toc" class="toc"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV id="toctitle"><H2>Contents</H2></DIV><UL><LI class="toclevel-1 tocsection-1"><A href="#Standard_Microbiological_Practices"><SPAN class="tocnumber">1</SPAN><SPAN class="toctext">Standard Microbiological Practices</SPAN></A></LI><LI class="toclevel-1 tocsection-2"><A href="#Safety_Equipment_.28Primary_Barriers.29"><SPAN class="tocnumber">2</SPAN><SPAN class="toctext">Safety Equipment (Primary Barriers)</SPAN></A></LI><LI class="toclevel-1 tocsection-3"><A href="#Laboratory_Facilities_.28Secondary_Barriers.29"><SPAN class="tocnumber">3</SPAN><SPAN class="toctext">Laboratory Facilities (Secondary Barriers)</SPAN></A></LI><LI class="toclevel-1 tocsection-4"><A href="#Simple_Questions"><SPAN class="tocnumber">4</SPAN><SPAN class="toctext">Simple Questions</SPAN></A></LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Standard_Microbiological_Practices">Standard Microbiological Practices</SPAN></H2><P><OL type="a"><LI><B>Statement of Purpose (SOP)</B> have been developed and are kept for easy access which enlists all the safety measures each experiment should be abided for.</LI><LI>Access to the laboratory is limited or restricted at the discretion of the laboratory director when experiments or work with cultures and specimens are in progress.</LI><LI>People wash their hands after handling viable materials, after removing gloves, and before leaving the laboratory.</LI><LI>Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human use are not permitted in the work areas.

Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
<UL><LI>   researcher safety,
    </LI><LI>   public safety, or
    </LI><LI>   environmental safety?</LI></UL></B></P><P><B><U>Researcher Safety</U></B><UL><LI><U><B>Chassis</B></U>: E.coli is the most commonly used gram-negative bacterial chassis in Molecular Biology. 
They are  normal flora of the human gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing <B>Vitamin K2</B>,and by preventing the establishment of other pathogenic bacteria within the intestine. Some strains of E.coli are also pathogenic, associated with sever diarrhea.
However the strains of E.coli used in lab are known to be non-pathogenic. However researchers are advised to use standard laboratory safety equipment and procedures while handling the cultures including wearing Lab coats, Safety Glasses etc.</LI><LI><U><B>EtBr</B></U>: Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent and is/was commonly used as a fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) for agarose gel electrophoresis in our lab. Ethidium bromide is thought to act as a mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA (i.e. inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like <B>DNA replication</B> and <B>transcription</B>. 
Hence, we do not wash the gel in EtBr solution. Instead, EtBr is added in minimal concentration to the agar solution before it solidifies. It is strictly observed that gloves are used when handling EtBr or EtBr-containing gel. The gels are discarded considering them to be '<B>Hazardous Waste</B>'.</LI><LI><U><B>Sodium Azide</B></U>: Sodium Azide is a strong respiratory toxin which inhibits the activity of cytochrome oxidase and acts as a bacteriostat. It is however also highly toxic to mammals. Researchers are required to be extremely careful while handling sodium azide solutions and cultures with sodium azide. Lab Coats and Gloves are a must, they must also be informed about the hazards and the first aid procedures in case of azide spills. 
</LI></UL><B><U>Public Safety</U></B><LI>All work with live E.coli cells is carried out in the laminar hood that eliminates the possibility of any <B>GMO</B>(Genetically Modified Organisms) from being released out.</LI><LI>Laboratory has been provided with doors, as these GMO should not be readily accessible to unintended personnel.</LI><LI>It is made sure that appropriate measures for waste disposal are taken. Waste is not washed down the sink or thrown into public dust-bins.</LI><LI><B><U>Environment Safety</U></B></LI><LI>All contaminated waste is treated as '<B>Bio-Hazardous Waste</B>' and is decontaminated before being put into a red trash bag or a sealed medical waste box. The bio-hazard bag is placed in a pre-chosen area for pick up.</LI><LI>We believe extensively in the three <B>'R's - Reduce, Reuse and Recyle</B>. By considering these constraints, we have learnt to plan our experiments better.</LI></P><B>
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
<UL><LI>  Did you document these issues in the Registry?
    </LI><LI>  How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
    </LI><LI>  How could other teams learn from your experience?
</LI></UL></B><P>
	No. All bio-bricks made are according to the safety guidelines provided by the <B>Center for Disease Control and Prevention</B>. 

</P><B>
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
<UL><LI>     If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
    </LI><LI>     If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?</LI></UL></B><P>
	Yes, our project is supported by the <B>Dept. of Biotechnology, IIT Madras</B>. They have provided us with <B>Biosafety level 1</B> facilities for all our experimental work.
