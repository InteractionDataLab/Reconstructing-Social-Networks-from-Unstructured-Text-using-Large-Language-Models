As is said popularly in society, “Team work is the secret that makes common people achieve uncommon results ” and let there be no doubt that there has been     a long list of people and organizations that have helped us in many ways so that we can keep working towards this project independently and with our own     creative ideas right since it’s conception.
First and foremost we are ever so grateful to the Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras and more so to the Head of Department- Prof. Mukesh Doble and     Senior Prof. K.B. Ramachandran for believing in the project and supporting it from the very beginning.

We would also like to thank the Cardiovascular Genetics Group mentored by our iGEM team Faculty Advisor Prof. N.R. Mahapatra for being generous with their     lab resources and helping us out with advice on experimental design and running of experiments.

We are especially grateful to some graduate students who were kind enough to help us out with their abundant knowledge and with experiments that we had to     do for the purpose of our project that they themselves were experts at. A big thank you to Parshuram J Sonawne for guiding us whenever we went to him     whether it was with troubleshooting failed experiments or designing new ones. We also want to thank Prashant Kumar for giving us fast-track tutorials on     peptide purification and helping us out on our experiments related to the same. And last but not the least, thanks to Vasanthan Ravichandran for helping us     out with the HPLC experiments.
We feel truly blessed to have such a helpful and enthusiastic senior graduate students who were willing to help us in any way that they could.
