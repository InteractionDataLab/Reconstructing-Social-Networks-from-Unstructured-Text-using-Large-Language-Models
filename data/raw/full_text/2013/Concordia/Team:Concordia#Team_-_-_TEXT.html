Jeremy Glass-Pilon
Team Leader
My name is Jeremy Glass-Pilon. I am a third year student in Concordia University's Molecular and Cell Biology Honours Program. I am involved in various fields of research, however my ultimate interest is applying synthetic biology to human health - especially cancer treatments. I am thrilled to be a part of Concordia University's first IGEM team and hope to represent my team and faculty well in the upcoming jamborees. Additionally, I am an avid gamer and enjoy to spend the little time off that I have with a good game or maybe a good book now and then. I love music and play both the Piano and Violin, but really, who has the time in our field. If you feel like it, follow me on Twitter: @JerGlassPilon and we can talk about synthetic biology, music or even games.

Lance Lafontaine
Lab Specialist
My name is Lance and I'm a 3rd-year Cell and Molecular Biology undergraduate student. I hope to work with synthetic biology or biotechnology startups one day and am excited to be representing Concordia in their first iGEM team. I would describe myself as a scientist, tech enthusiast, freethinker, and innovator. Feel free to get in touch at lance.lafontaine92@gmail.com

Melissa Valente
Lab Specialist
My name is Melissa Valente Paterno and I am currently undertaking my third year in a B.Sc. Honors Cell and Molecular Biology with a minor in multidisciplinary studies. My interests lie primarily in synthetic biology research with an added emphasis on human genetics. I am a dedicated Concordia Molecular Biology student, and as such am very proud to be in the first Concordia University IGEM team! This year I am mostly taking part in the science design/wet works team, but will also offer help wherever it is needed. On my free time I enjoy reading, singing, figure skating, and spending time with my loving friends and family. I can be contacted via Facebook at Melissa Valente Paterno.

Laura Leclerc
Lab Specialist
Laura Leclerc is a Cell and Molecular Biology undergraduate minoring in business in her last year studying at Concordia University. Having learned to read science magazines, science fiction novels, and the internet at an early age, it did not take long to discover a passion for the sciences. At the age of seven, she was determined to pursue a future in genetics so as to grant cats the ability to speak. Needless to say, things have changed (but they will never be forgotten.) She now wishes to some day join the ranks of humanity's battle against disease and age-related illnesses... from fun new angles such as those offered by synthetic biology!

My research interests are diverse, but may be placed into two large bins. First, at Concordia Computational Intelligence Lab (CCIL) we research and develop solutions to problems in Artificial Intelligence & Evolutionary Computing as well as Pattern Classification & Image Processing. More specifically, we use tools including well-established methods from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to solve problems of written pattern classification and biomedical image segmentation. Our work has resulted in new methods for multiple ellipse detection in images, as well as new means of scheduling tasks on heterogeneous multi-processor machines.

My research interests fall into two main axes. First, our laboratory is investigating biochemical and molecular aspects of the sulfonation reaction in relation to plant growth, development and adaptation to stress using Arabidopsis thaliana sulfotransferases as a model system. To date, we have characterized two sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of brassinosteroids and hydroxylated derivatives of jasmonic acid, respectively. The biochemical function and the pattern of expression of these enzymes suggest that plants like mammals use the sulfonation reaction to modulate the biological activity of hormones and chemical messengers. Our second axis of research is the study of the structure function relationship of sulfotransferases in order to elucidate the mechanism of sulfonate transfer and to define the amino acids responsible for substrate binding and catalysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the flavonol 3-sulfotransferase, we mapped several amino acids required for catalysis and cosubstrate binding while the construction of chimeric proteins allowed to define the domain responsible for substrate specificity.

I have recently graduated from Honors Biochemistry. When not involved in cellular automaton, i enjoy playing tennis, swimming, karate as well as various adventures. Although new to iGEM competition i was intrigued by the concept of synthetic biology for quite some time, and i enjoyed helping to advise the iGEM team.
