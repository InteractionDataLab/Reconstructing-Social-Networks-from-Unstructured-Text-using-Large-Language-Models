1.IL10recepter
We inserted Il10receptere gene into vecter
1 transformation
Figure 1transformation of Il10recepter α
Figure2 transformation of Il10recepter β
2 .culture on the LB nutrient medium and get colonies.
3 colony PCR
The molecular weight of the α chain is 1734bp. The molecular weight of the α chain is 975bp
Figure3 Il10recepter α colony PCR
‎
Figure4 Il10recepter β colony PCR
4 restriction enzyme processing PCR production
5 infusion
6 .transformation
7 culture on the LB nutrient medium and get colonies.
8 colony PCR
The molecular weight of the vector is a 4000 ~ 5000bp.
We were not able to confirm the vector by colony PCR.
2 STAT3
We inserted stat3 gene into vector
1 transformation
Figure5 transformation of STAT3

8 colony PCR
The molecular weight of the vector is a 4000 ~ 5000bp.
We were not able to confirm the vector by colony PCR.
3 GFP+HlyA
We inserted GFP gene and HlyA into vecter
1 transformation
