1.Overview
We did questionary survey about the gene recombination to a university student. As a result of questionnaire, we could know that there were many people who had a bad image for gene recombination.
“How do you think of gene recombination?”
Answer result
It is adverse effects to a body.
It might change ecosystem.
It is untrustworthy.
It is difficult.
We thought that we wanted many people to know the good point of genetic modification and the synthetic creature.
2.Posters
We want to convey that experiment of a gene recombination is not a dangerous thing. We made the poster of the question and answer form to make general people understand it.
At first we felt that understanding about the reason why experiment of a gene recombination is dangerous for general people didn't have enough information. Therefore we commented on the risk of the gene recombination experiment from a point of view of the diffusion the recombination creature to the environment. And we gave the following examples and explained that there was an international decision for nonproliferation of the gene recombination creature to the environment.
There are P1, P2, P3 level in the laboratory where we experiment of gene recombination.
There is Cartagena Protocol about the handling of the gene recombination creature.
Our university has the laboratory of P1 and P2 level. We explained to a general person that we abide for nonproliferation of the genetically-modified creature to the environment.
And we made the poster about the activity contents of the iGEM.
3.Questionnaire
Our survey consisted of the following questions:
Q1.Are you interested in genetic modification?
Q2.What kind of impression did you have about genetic modification before hearing this explanation?
Q3.After having heard this explanation, what kind of impression did you have about genetic modification?
Q4.Was our explanation plain?
Q5.Were you interested in genetic modification?

4.Conclusions
As a result of our Human Practice, we conveyed gene recombination as a right knowledge and were able to change the consciousness of many people. We strongly think that synthetic biology will greatly develop in the near future.
