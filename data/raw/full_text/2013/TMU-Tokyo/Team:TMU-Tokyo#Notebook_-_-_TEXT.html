P1 phage preparation
① making calcium cultures
overnight culture 0.5ml
LB midium （liquid） 1.4ml
CaCl2 - 0.1M  0.1ml
Cultivation condition （37℃, 130 shake/minute, over 2 hour）
② making LB・calcium plates

Yeast Extract  0.5g
NaCl  1g
NaOH-10N  20ml
agarose  1g
Autoclave (121℃, 25 minutes ).

Dispense this midium in 4 plates.
③ Preparation of soft agar
prepare a alminium thermostat block and soft agar（agarose 0.3％）
Warm soft agar on alminium thermostat block
Dispense 3ml soft agar in a test tube.
We move test tubes in a alminium block.
④ superposition of soft agar
To transfuse Ca culture(0.4ml) into the test tube.
To add IPTG(5µl) and P1 bacteriophage (2µl) to the test tube.
To mix Soft agar well by a vortex mixer.
Soft agar pour to the test tube which contains caculture(0.4ml) and IPTG(5µl).
To mix test tube well by a mixer and poured into Ca・LB(solid)
After the content set, it is incubated with an incubator for 6 ~ 7 hours.
We prepare chloroform and we put chloroform 0.1 cc into a centrifugal tube.
After it is centrifuged, its supernatant is moved to the centrifugal tube containing chloroform and they are mixed by mixer..
The centrifuge is carried out.(speed: 3000・10min・ACCEL 8・４degrees )
The supernatant is moved to the newly test tube.
It is saved in a refrigerator of 4 degrees.
⑤ soft agarのかきだし
Soft agar is gathered up in one side using a spreader.
Soft agar is moved to the test tube using a Pipetman.
The test tube is mixed by a mixer so that soft agar is powderized
Sentrifuge is carried out (speed 3000・10min・ACCEL8・4 degrees)
Electroporation
Putting LB 200ml into sakaguchi flask.
Putting IPTG 25mg in DW2ml.*1
Putting 0.5cc overnight culture and IPTG 2ml into the sakaguchi flask.
It is done shaking culture (37℃, 130 times).
It is put into the centrifuge tube and centrifuge(speed:8000, time:5, temperature:4).
When centrifugation finish, we discard the supernatant quickly.
A 10% glycerol of 10ml is put into it. And it also removes to other sentrifuge.
It is centrifuged(speed:4000, time:10min, temperature:4).>
After centrifugation finish, glycerol is scavenged with aspirator.
A glycerol of 10ml is put into it on ice and mix mildly.
A glycerol of 10ml is put into it again
It is centrifuge again(speed:4000, time: 10 min, temperature:4).
The DNA is on ice. And we put DNA 5λinto sample tube.
We put 1ml SOC medium into sampling tube, and put 5λIPTG.
When centrifugation finish, the supernatant is scavenged with aspirator.
We mix 10ml glycerol and suspend.
We mix 10ml glycerol again.
It is put into a centrifuge
It is centrifuge again(speed:4000, time: 10 min, temperature:4).
5λIPTG is put into SOC..
When centrifugation finish, the supernatant is scavenged with aspirator.
We mix 40λwith 5λDNA which is introduction DNA in sampling tube and blend it using mixer. It is on ice.
All sample is put into cuvette for electroporation using a Pipetman.
Flow current to it
When we hear electric sounds, we put SOC in it.
We incubate it for an hour, 30℃.
We put it of 120λ per a plate. Also we mix IPTG of 5λper a plate. And we spread it.
(ア) *1 IPTG is for using RED recombination. RED recombination system is induced by IPTG in our strain. If you do electroporation for plasimid DNA, IPTG addition is unneeded.
