Our University
All members of our team belong to department of Biological Science at Tokyo Metropolitan University, which located in Hachioji city.
Address：〒192-0364 1-1, Minamiosawa, Hachioji-city, Tokyo.
TMU-Tokyo official team profile is here.
Support from the following laboratories
The all of following laboratories are in our university.
Molecular Genetics Lab
Environmental Microbiology Lab
Plant Photoregulation Lab
Cellular Genetics Lab
These laboratories provided the experiment space, some biological materials, and reagent to us. Also some members of these laboratories including our team’s instructors held the safety class for us.
Materials we have received from the following laboratories
