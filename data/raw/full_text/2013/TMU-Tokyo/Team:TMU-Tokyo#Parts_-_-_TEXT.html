BBa_K1015013 ：Km-Blunt end
This is what connected the blunt end to cohesive end of pSB1C3.
BBa_K1015014 ：IRR/IRL(Ptet)-FLP-Sm(insert between lacA and cynR)
This device produce FLP and AadA(streptomycin resistant gene) . But if site specific recombination be caused between IRR site and IRL site by FimE recombinase, pTet promoter change "OFF" state and FLP production stop.
BBa_K1015015 ：araC-pBAD-hbiF-Tc(genome insertion parts between araC and araA)
With bacteriophage λ recombination system, this device insert into Escherichia coli genome. This device produce hbiF recombinase and tetracycline resistance protein (tetA). HbiF production level are regulated by arabinose inducible promoter pBAD.
BBa_K1015016 ：lacI+FRT+Cm
This is genome insertion part. The device is: R(SaApR)homology sequence(BBa_K1015018) + lacI(BBa_K1015008) + FRT(BBa_K1015009) + mhpA homology sequence(BBa_K1015009).
BBa_K1015017 ：FRT+Ap(for RED system)
This is genome insertion parts. Site      specific recombination site. if it happens by Flp sequences between 2 place of FRT is left out.
