We planned making a self assessment for our experiment.
For that, we made Safety Checklist.
The safety of our experiment is ensured by this checklist.

We thought that it was very important to experiment safely and wrote this policy on“iGEM 2013 basic safety form”too. Our team members think that the experiments done in dangerous way are meaningless. Therefore, we took care to protect biodiversity against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Also we really took care our project didn't have any bad effect on environment and human body.
Therefore, we received the safety guidsnce from our instructors to experiment safely at laboratories. In the guidance, we are taught that how we should write the experimental data in notebooks and how we should use  experimental devices or chemicals are in the laboratories.
Also we’ve experimented along their lab’s rules.
