I have been an assistant professor in the Department of Bionanoscience at TU Delft since January 2011. My laboratory utilizes techniques of biochemistry and microbiology to study processes of stress response in bacteria. In particular we are currently interested in biocrystallization, a phenomenon in which bacteria condense their chromosome into a highly compacted linear array that can provide protection from damaging environmental conditions. I love the chance that iGEM offers to students to truly design and drive their own scientific project from start to finish, and I am thrilled to be an advisor to our team this year.
