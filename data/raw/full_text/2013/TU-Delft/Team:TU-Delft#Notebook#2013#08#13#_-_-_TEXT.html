Lab work
1. Made Minimal media and starvation media for Bacillus subtilis.
2. Carried out colony PCR on BBConst-AgrAC-pP2-GFP.
3. Transformations of the pT7-peptides and pSB1C3-Magainin was carried out in XL1 Blue cells.
4. The oligopeptides and primers were PCRed and ligated with His-SUMO in pET23B backbone.
