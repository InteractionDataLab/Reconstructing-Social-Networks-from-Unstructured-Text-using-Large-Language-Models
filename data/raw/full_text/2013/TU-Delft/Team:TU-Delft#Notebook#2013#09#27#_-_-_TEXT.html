Lab work
1. The construct pT7 SUMO Peptide was induced with IPTG and a SDS page was run to look for expression of SUMO Peptides.
Tricine gel SUMO-Peptide (signiferin)
SUMO-Peptide with IPTG induction
SUMO-Peptide with IPTG induction
2. The construct with pBAD Receiver GFP was induced with 0.1 % Arabinose and after 1 hour induced with AIP's. This was analysed on FACS for GFP Signals. The control was Const GFP and BL21 cells. But the experiment was a failure as the construct itself was faulty.
3. Colony PCR was done on some colonies seen on the plates for pTet cI TT pcI Ulp lysis pSB1C3.
4. Due to repeated failure of the pTet cI TT pcI Ulp Lysis construct ligation for pTet cI TT pcI Ulp with GFP behind it was started:
GFP (X+P) and pTet cI TT pcI Ulp (S+P)
