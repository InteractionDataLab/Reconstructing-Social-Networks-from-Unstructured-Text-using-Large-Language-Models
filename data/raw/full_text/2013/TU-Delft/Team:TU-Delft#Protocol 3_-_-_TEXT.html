Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation
Gel Extraction Procedure
PCR Purification
Tricine Gels
General Peptide Production
SUMO cleavage
Lysis Protocol
AIP Sensing Protocol
Gene Design
Primer Design
Making glycerol stocks
Requirements:
bacterial culture
80% glycerol
Procedure:
The bacterial cells are grown overnight.
In a glass tube take 250 μL of 80 % Glycerol solution.
Pipet 1mL of the cell culture into 0.25 mL 80% glycerol and mix by vortexing and save in -80 °C freezer.
The glycerol stock can be used whenever required, by just adding 0.5 mL of stock into 5 mL of freshly prepared media.
