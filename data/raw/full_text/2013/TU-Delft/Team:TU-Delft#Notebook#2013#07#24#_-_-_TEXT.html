Lab work
1. The Quick change of SUMO and Ulp1 failed again. So we analysed the reasons for the failure. The DNA sample of SUMO DNA and Ulp DNA was not pure and had protein in it when it was check on Nanodrop. A protein purification step was carried out inorder to purify it.
2. The DNA purified from the above did not show satisfying results on the Nanodrop, so we are culturing the DNA for SUMO and Ulp1 again.
3. Staphyllococcus delphini has shown good results on the Agar plates. This was re-streaked to get single colonies.
4. Bacillus subtilis has arrived from Leiden University, which is also streaked on Agar plates.
