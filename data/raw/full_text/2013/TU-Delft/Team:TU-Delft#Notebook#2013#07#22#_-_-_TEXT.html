22nd of June
Lab Report week 14/7/2013-19/7/2013
This week procurements :
1. Synthetic peptide (Maximin , Signiferin & Magainin)
2. Bacillus Bio Bricks from LMU Munich
The  following transformations were made and miniprepped:
1. Agr AC+pP2+GFP
2. pTet+cI
The above miniprepped plasmids were digested using following restriction enzymes
Gene
Enzymes
Status
Agr AC+pP2+GFP
X+P
Worked
pTet+cI
E+S
Worked
The respective ligations were made.
1. pTet:cI+ TT (double terminator)
2. pBad+Agr:pP2:GFP
They were transformed in top 10 cells and the colonies were selected , cultured and miniprepped. The quick change on the SUMO and Ulp were made but the results were unsuccessful.
The pT7 promoter plasmid containing strain was cultured and prepped.
