Lab work
1. Carried out colony PCR on pTET:RBS:cI and ran on gel. Colony 5 was selected and inoculated in LB Broth.
2. Carried out colony PCR on His-SUMO peptides with correct primer for pET23B and ran on gel. This gel gave good results.
3. Transformation of pBAD:AgrAC:pP2 was done in XL1 Blue cells and plated on agar plates.
4. PCR purification of His-SUMO-Peptides was done.
5. 10X TBE buffer was made and kept in stock.
