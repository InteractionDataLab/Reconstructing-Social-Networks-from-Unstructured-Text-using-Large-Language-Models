Lab work
1. Made glycerol stocks for all the transformations done on 9/7/13.
2. DNA extraction of all transformations to send for sequencing.
3. Experiment with tetracycline for checking of pTET:lysis device failed.
4. Started new transformations :
Part
Resistance
Cells
pTET:lysis device
Ampicillin
DH5Alpha
AgrB:AgrD
Kanamycin
BL21
pConst
Ampicillin
DH5Alpha
All transformations were streaked on agar plates with corresponding antibiotic resistance.
5. Prepared flasks for autoclaving.
