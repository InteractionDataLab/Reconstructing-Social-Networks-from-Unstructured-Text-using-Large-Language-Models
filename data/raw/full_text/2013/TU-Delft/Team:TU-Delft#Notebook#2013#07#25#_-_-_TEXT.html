Lab work
1. The Peptides : Magainin and Signiferin showed good results. The plates plated again.
2. DNA extraction of pT7, SUMO and Ulp1 was carried out.
3. Colony PCR on pTET:cI:TT was done. The ligation product was transformed into XL1 blue cells.
4. Stapyllococcus delphini and Bacillus subtilis has grown well on the plates.
5. Quick change of SUMO and Ulp 1 was done at annealing temperatures 60 degree and 55 degree and transformed into XL1 Blue cells.
