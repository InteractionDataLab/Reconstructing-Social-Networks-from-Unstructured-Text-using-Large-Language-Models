Lab work
1. Restriction digestion was started on :
Part
Restriction enzyme
Ulp 1
BamHI + XhoI
SUMO
AlfII + BamHI
pT7onst
SpeI + PstI
B. subtilis backbone const
SpeI + PstI
B. subtilis backbone IPTG
SpeI + PstI
pBAD Agr AC pP2 GFP
SpeI + PstI
These were kept on 37⁰C overnight for proper digestion.
2. 0.608 mg of Signiferin peptide was dissolved in 100 µL of water.
3. 0.350 mg of Maximin H5 peptide was dissolved in 100 µL of water + 5mM NH4HCO3.
