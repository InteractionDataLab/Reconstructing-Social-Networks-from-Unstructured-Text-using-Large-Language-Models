Lab work
1. The Transformed pT7:RBS:Maximin:His6, SUMO-Magainin II, SUMO-Signiferin and SUMO-Maximin H5 were inoculated in LB broth.
2. Transformation was carried out on pT7:Maximin H5: His6 in BL21 cells to induce with IPTG and carry out His-purification step.
3. Mini prep on BBa_p0440 (RBS:TetR:TT) was carried out.
4. BBa_p0440 (RBS:TetR:TT) was restriction digested with E+X, E+S, X+P and run on gel.
5. CIP treatment and Ethanol purification was carried out on pBAD:receiver.
6. pBAD:receiver insert from the PCR product was cut with X+P.
7. Inculated S.delphini, B.subtilis and DH5 alpha cells.
