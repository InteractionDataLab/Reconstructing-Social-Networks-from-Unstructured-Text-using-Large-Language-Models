22nd of September
Lab work
1. Mini prep was done on the colonies grown from yesterday:
pBAD Ulp TT pT7 SUMO signiferin, pcI Ulp pSB1C3, Lysis pSB1C3, pTet cI TT pSB1C3
2. Colony PCR was done for the following:
3. Ran the restriction digestions on gel:
4. Ligation of the pTet cI TT + pcI Ulp (Batch B).
5. Inoculated :
pBAD Ulp TT pT7 SUMO Peptides in BL21 from the glycerol stocks.
S. delphini, B. subtilis, and BL21 cells.
Sender and receiver cassette
GFP constitutive (for control)
6. Restriction digestion of pTet cI TT pSB1C3 with S+P and pcI Ulp pSB1C3  with X+P was started.
7. Sent all samples which were minipreped for sequencing.
