Lab work
1. The lysis experiment was carried out again on the plate reader. Duplicates were used and BL21 Cells were control.

2. The corrected construct of the pBAD AIP Receiver GFP colonies 6, 7 and 8 were induced with Arabinose 0.1% and AIP 1 µM and 10 µM. Controls of No Arabinose and No AIP, No Arabinose and only AIP, No AIP and only arabinose induction were also done.
3 Hours after AIP induction the samples were analyzed on FACS for signals of GFP.
4. pBAD Ulp TT pT7 SUMO Signiferin construct was induced with Arabinose and IPTG to check for the cleavage of SUMO-Peptide by Ulp protease. The cells were french pressed and stored in -80 degree. MIC experiment will be carried out on it and an SDS Page will be run to check for Ulp, SUMO-Peptide and cleaved peptide bands.
5. Samples of the pT7 Sumo peptides were given for MS measurements.
