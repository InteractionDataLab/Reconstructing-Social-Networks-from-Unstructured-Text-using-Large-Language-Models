Lab work
1. Started CIP treatment on the samples which were digested on 5/8/13, after heat inactivation of enzymes(1 hour at 37⁰C).
2. Stared T4 PNK treatment on the oligo's for removing the Eco RI site from Ulp I and SUMO. 20 µM oligo's (10 µL 100 µM oligos + 40 µL H2O), 5.6 µL 10X PNK Buffer and 1.5 µL PNK.
3. Dissolved magaininin 1 mL of H2O and divided in 10 aliquotes and kept at -20°C.
