Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation
Gel Extraction Procedure
PCR Purification
Tricine Gels
General Peptide Production
SUMO cleavage

Lysis Protocol
Procedure
Grow the BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pT7 lysis cassette overnight in LB meduim with the right antibiotic, (in this case ampicillin or carbenicillin) .
Make a 10X stock solution of IPTG by adding 10µL of the 1000X IPTG (1M) in 990 µL of LB with the right antibiotic.
Make 1/50 times dilutions of the overnight grown culture. Wait untill the OD at 600nm reaches 0.4-0.6.
Then make the below combinations into the 96 well plate for the plate reader to take readings.

Readings were taken, using a plate reader capable of shaking and heating to 37˚C, for BL21 as control, pT7-lysis cassette in BL21 plysS. (all performed in duplo).
