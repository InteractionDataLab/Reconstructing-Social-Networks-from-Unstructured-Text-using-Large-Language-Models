Timon
In September 2012, I joined the Department of Bionanoscience (BN) at the TU Delft as an assistant professor. My group uses theoretical methods to model systems that exhibit collective dynamics, on a wide range of scales, all the way from molecules to organisms. An important reason for me as a theorist to come work at the predominantly experimental BN department was the opportunity to collaborate directly with experimentalists, interacting with them on a daily basis. The same is true for iGEM, where the project can only be successful if experimentalists and modelers work together. Given my background I am mostly involved in the modeling side of the iGEM project, but as an advisor, not an instructor. Its really the student's project, which is the other reason why I think iGEM is something great!
