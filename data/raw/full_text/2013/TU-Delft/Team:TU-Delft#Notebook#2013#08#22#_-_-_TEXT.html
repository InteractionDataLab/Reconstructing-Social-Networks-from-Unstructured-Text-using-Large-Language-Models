Lab work
1. pBAD:Agr AC:pP2, restriction digested back bone of B. subtilis , AIP:GFP:TT was run on gel electrophoresis.
2. Inoculation of pBAD(BBa_K20600) from glycerol stock in LB broth with chloroamphenicol resistance.
3. Inoculation of pTET:RBS:TT.
4. Sent samples of pBAD:AgrAC:pP2 from colony 3 and colony 7 for sequencing.
5. MIC determination experiment was carried out on E.coli, S.delphini and B.subtilis by inducing with 'Signiferin' peptide. The peptide was found to stop only the growth of S.delphini and B.subtilis.
