29th of July
Lab work
1. The DNA extraction of Magainin and Signiferin from the transformed cells were sent for sequencing.
2. Restriction digestion of pTET:cI and TT, as the earlier pTET:cI:TT cassette didnot work.
3. Prepared LB Broth, Agar, and sterile flasks and eppendorf tubes.
4. The Gel electrophoresis of Maximin H5 was run but it didnot give good results.
5. The colony 1 and colony 5 were selected and grown in LB broth.
6. Transformation of BBa_P0440, RBS:TetR:TT was done in XL 1 Blue cells and plated on Agar.
