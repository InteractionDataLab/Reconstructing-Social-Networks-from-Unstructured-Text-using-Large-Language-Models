Lab work
1. The transformation of pT7 was successful. Inoculated it on LB broth.
2. Made glycerol stocks of pDR110, pDR111 (Bacillus Backbones). Mini prep was also carried out on all.
3. Transformation of the ligations done on 29/08/13 on XL1 Blue cells was carried out:
Maximin H5 pSB1C3
Signiferin pSB1C3
Magainin II pSB1C3
Maximin H5 Tet R (Bharat)
Signiferin Tet R (Bharat)
Magainin II Tet R (Bharat)
Maximin H5 Tet R (Derk)
Signiferin Tet R (Derk)
Magainin II Tet R (Derk)
pBAD Receiver Impure
pBAD Receiver Pure
