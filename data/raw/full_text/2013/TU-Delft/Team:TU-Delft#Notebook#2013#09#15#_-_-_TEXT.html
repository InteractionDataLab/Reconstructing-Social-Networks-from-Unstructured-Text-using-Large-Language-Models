Lab work
1. Transformed the right pT7 Lysis B from 07-09-13 col 2, which was sequenced by Macrogen, into BL21.
2. Ran gel on the PCR of the receiver GFP for the Bacillus subtilis backbone. But it was not successful as wrong primers were used.
3. Inoculated pBAD Ulp TT pT7 SUMO Magainin and pBAD Ulp TT pT7 SUMO Maximin in BL21.
4. Mini prep was done on pBAD receiver and pcI Ulp Lysis. It was sent for sequencing.
