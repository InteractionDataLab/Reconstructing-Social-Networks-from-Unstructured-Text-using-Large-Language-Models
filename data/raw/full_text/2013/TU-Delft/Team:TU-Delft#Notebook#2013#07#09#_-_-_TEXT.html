Lab work
1. The agar plates of pBAD, pT7, GFP, AIP sender(Agr A: AgrC). AIP receiver(AgrB: AgrD), pTET:lysis didnot give convincing results. So it was discarded.
2. We start afresh to make the timer from iGEM 2009.
3. List of transformations:

All transformations were streaked on agar plates with corresponding antibiotic resistance.
4. Streaked the pBAD - 10% and 90%, pT7 - 10% and 90% on Agar plates.
5. Did short experiment to check if the first attempt of pTET:lysis worked. Added Tetracycline to pTET:lysis in concentrations of 1% and 10%. Would check results tomorrow.
