Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation
Gel Extraction Procedure
PCR Purification
Tricine Gels
General Peptide Production
SUMO cleavage
Lysis Protocol
AIP Sensing Protocol
Gene Design
Primer Design
