Lab work
1. The restriction digestions were run on gel. Gel pictures are as follows:
2.Ligations were carried out after gel extractions from today's gels. They were:
       Lysis device (E+X) with pcI:Ulp (E+S)
       pT7(S+P) with Lysis device (X+P)
3. PCR was run on the AIP Receiver to get the insert.
4. Ligations were carried out after gel extractions from today's gels. They were:
       Lysis device (E+X) with pcI:Ulp (E+S)
       pT7(S+P) with Lysis device (X+P)
5. Started Restriction digestion on :
       pBAD(S+P)
       Lysis device (E+S)
6. Transformed pT7 Lysis (Batch B), pcI Ulp Lysis Ligation in XL 1 Blue cells.
