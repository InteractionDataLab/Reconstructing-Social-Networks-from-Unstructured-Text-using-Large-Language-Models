Brainstorm
The most important part for each iGem Team is to choose the right project!We spent a lot of time in brainstorming.It took us from March till early May in order to find a project suitable for us.        The ideas were a lot and interesting but we had to choose only one. Taking into consideration a lot of parameters such as the feasibility, the limited amount of time and the satisfaction of all the team members we came out with our final idea!Some of the ideas that we had are listed below so as to be an inspiration for future iGem Teams!
