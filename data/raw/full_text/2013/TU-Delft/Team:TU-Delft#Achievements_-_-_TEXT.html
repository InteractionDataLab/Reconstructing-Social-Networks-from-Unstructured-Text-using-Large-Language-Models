Judging Criteria
We think we should be awarded with a gold medal because we achieved all the criteria mentioned in the judging form and the criteria setup by iGEM headquarters. We documented, characterized and improved multiple new standard biobricks and submitted these in the iGEM Registry. We designed and characterized a novel approach for the production and expression of proteins that would normally be insoluble or would get caught in inclusion bodies with the submission of our SUMO/Ulp1 system. In addition to the submission of the SUMO/Ulp1 system, we also designed a novel assembly standard. Furthermore, to our knowledge we are the first to show the interspecies communication between a Gram- negative and a Gram- positive species with our AIP receiver GFP system, and the first to characterize the biobrick used to do so. In human practice we contributed by the fact we made it possible for less well funded teams to make their own DIY fluorescent scanner with the designing  and publishing of all the technical details of our Zephyr. Besides this we developed a novel approach for the designing of anti-microbial peptides, we determined and proved their functionality, both in their toxicity towards Gram-positives and their lack of it towards mammalian cells.

Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
At least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device:
BBa_K1022100 , BBa_K1022101 , BBa_K1022102, BBa_K1022103 , BBa_K1022102, BBa_K1022109 , BBa_K1022114 , BBa_K1022116 , BBa_K1022117 , BBa_K1022118
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Pt7 His Sumo peptide constructs ( BBa_K1022101 , BBa_K1022102, BBa_K1022103 ), BBa_K1022116 , Pbad Ulp PT7 His Sumo peptide constructs ( BBa_K1022117 , BBa_K1022118 )
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
This is done for all the above mentioned parts.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project
All these aspects have been taken into consideration, this is explained on this human practice page .
Gold
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, enter this information in the Registry, create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
The AIP receiver characterization with the Pbad inducible promoter ( BBa_K1022100 ), lysis cassette inducible with Pt7 ( BBa_K1022114 ), improvement on the lysis cassette ( BBa_K1022109 )
We collaborated with:
Norwich iGem Team: we sent them the soil samples that were taken from Botanical Garden of TUDelft
Purdue iGem Team: we sent them the biobricks BBa_K775009 and BBa_K77500 from TUDelft iGem Team of 2012
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts.
Two novel approaches have been taken on human practice, the design of the Zephyr and the design of new antimicrobial peptides . This is explained further on this human practice page .
