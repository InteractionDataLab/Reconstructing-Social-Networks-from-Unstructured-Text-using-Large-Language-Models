Zoe
Zoë Robaey is currently a PhD student at the Center for Ethics and Technology at Delft University in the Netherlands. She is working within the project ‘New Technologies as Social Experiments: Conditions for Morally Responsible Experimentation' and concentrates on the case of biotechnology with a focus on regulation and ownership of genetically modified crops in agriculture, as well as questions of moral responsibility.
Zoë graduated from a Master’s of Public Policy at the Hertie School of Governance (Berlin, Germany) in 2011 with a specialization in sustainability. Her master thesis formulated recommendations for the diffusion of smart grids in the European Union. Her research was sponsored by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). She also completed an MA in European Studies on Society, Science and Technology from Maastricht University (Netherlands) in 2008. Her thesis dealt with the “Differing Views of Uncertainty in Environmental Controversies: The Kearl Oil Sands Case 2003-2008 in Canada” and was awarded second place of the Rachel Carson Awards by the Dutch Environmental Professionals Association (Vereniging van Milieuprofessionals). In 2007, she completed her BSc in Biology and the University of Ottawa (Canada).
In addition to her academic background, Zoë gathered work experience in the non-governmental sector with the Ecologic Institute in Berlin. She started as a Transatlantic Fellow in 2008 and then worked as a Research Assistant, parallel to her studies of Public Policy. Her work focused on questions of natural resource management, sustainability in infrastructure, energy and consumer behavior, as well as on participatory processes and the diffusion of green technologies. As part of her degree in Public Policy, Zoë also worked at Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) in Waterloo (Canada) in the context of their annual conference, which was on climate negotiations in 2010.
