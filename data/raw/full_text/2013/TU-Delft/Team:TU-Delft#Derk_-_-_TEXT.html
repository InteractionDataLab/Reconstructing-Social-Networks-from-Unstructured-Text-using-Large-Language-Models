Derk Te Winkel
Derk
My name is Derk te Winkel and I live and study in Leiden. I just finished the first year of the master Molecular and Cellular Biology. During my bachelor internship I worked with Arabidopsis and during my master internship  with mammalian cells and E.coli as they are such great little workers. The iGEM challenge is the first time though to really modify an organism and I'm quite excited about it. I'm also excited about the fact we work on antimicrobial peptides as I find fighting microbes very interesting
