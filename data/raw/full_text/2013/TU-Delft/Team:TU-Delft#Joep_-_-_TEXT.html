Joep
Synthetic biology is a rapidly developing field with a lot of interesting research going on. Contributing to this research and specifically trying to make a real product or application of it is what attracts me to iGEM. I am a first year master student 'Systems and Control' at Delft University of Technology and my BSc. was in mechanical engineering. So, synthetic biology is new to me, which makes it exciting to discover, one of my main reason to join iGEM. I also enjoy a lot to work in this multidisciplinary team: the different views (or you may call it creativity) in brainstorming often catches me by surprise. In my free time I play squash to hit away the daily frustrations or go running to enjoy nature.
