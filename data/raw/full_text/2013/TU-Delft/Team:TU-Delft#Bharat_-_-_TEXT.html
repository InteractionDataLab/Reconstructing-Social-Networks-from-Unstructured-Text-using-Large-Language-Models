Bharat
I am Bharath Kumar Raghuraman, doing my Masters in Life Science and Technology. I got interested in iGEM because, of its motive to take synthetic biology to public and its contribution to the development of biological sciences. My hobbies are playing table tennis, cricket , listening to music and philately. I am the lab manager and the scientific officer of my team.
