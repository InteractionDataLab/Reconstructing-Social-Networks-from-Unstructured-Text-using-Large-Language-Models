Lab work
1.DNA extraction of BBConst-AgrAC-pP2-GFP-TT from colonies grown on 14/8/13.
2. Mass spectrometry was done on the peptide proteins. The UV absorbance and MS-Q Time of flight graphs were obtained to check the concentration of peptides.
3. Restriction digestion of RBS-TetR-TT, pTet-RBS and pBAD-AgrAC-TT-pP2 with S+P was carried out and kept in 37°C for 2 hours.
4. pConst was cut with S+P earlier, CIP treatment was carried out on it today, followed by PCR purification.
5. AgrAC-pP2-GFP-TT was run on gel and DNA was extracted from the gel.
6. Ligation of pConst and AgrAC-pP2-GFP-TT was carried out again.
7. pT7 and lysis device was ligated and kept in water bath at 16°C.
