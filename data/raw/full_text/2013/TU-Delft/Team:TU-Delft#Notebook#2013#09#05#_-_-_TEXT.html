Lab work
1. Mini prep was done on BBa_P0440 to get the pSB1C3 backbone.
2. The restriction digestions were run on gel. Gel pictures are as follows:
3. Colony PCR of the pT7 Lysis Transformations was done. The gel is as follows:
2. Restriction digestion was done for the following:
       RBS: Tet R : TT with E+S
       pT7 SUMO Peptide with E+X
       pT7 SUMO Peptide with S+P
       pcI Ulp with E+S
       pTet:cI:TT with E+S
       AIP Receiver (PCR Purified) with X+P
3. Running the restriction digestions on gel:
4. Started Restriction digestion on :
       AIP receiver with X+P
       pBAD Ulp TT with E+S
       pcI Ulp with X+P
5. Ligations were carried out after gel extractions from today's gels. They were:
       pcI Ulp (E+S) with pSB1C3 (E+S)
       pTet:cI:TT (E+S) with pSB1C3 (E+S)
       Lysis device (E+S) with pSB1C3 (E+S)
6. Transformations of pBAD Ulp TT in XL Blue cells.
7. Inoculated pcI Ulp, pT7 Lysis (Batch A) colony 2,3,4.
8. Sent samples to iGEM HQ, as submission of biobricks. They are as follows :
     BBa_K1022103      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Magainin II
     BBa_K1022102      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Signiferin
     BBa_K1022101      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Maximin H5
     BBa_K1022106      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Magainin II RBS TetR TT
     BBa_K1022105      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Signiferin  RBS TetR TT
     BBa_K1022104      pT7 His 6 - SUMO Maximin H5  RBS TetR TT
