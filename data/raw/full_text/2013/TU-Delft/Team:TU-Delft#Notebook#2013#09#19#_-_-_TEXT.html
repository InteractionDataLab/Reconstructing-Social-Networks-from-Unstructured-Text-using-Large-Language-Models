Lab work
1. Restriction digestion is started for pTet cI TT with S+P and with pcI Ulp with X+P.   2. Colony PCR was done for the following:
3. The lysis experiment was carried out on a plate reader for 2 colonies from the pT7 Lysis transformed into BL21 plysS to check whether on inducing the pT7 promoter with IPTG, the cells lyse. The 10 X IPTG stock was made from 1000X IPTG stock (10 µL of 1000X IPTG in 990 µL of LB Broth). The loading of samples on the 96-well plate was done as follows:

The results can be seen in the page : Lysis experiment
5. Ligations were done for :
          Lysis Device + pSB1C3
          pTet cI TT + pSB1C3
          pcI Ulp + pSB1C3
6. Reinoculated the colonies from the colony PCR.
