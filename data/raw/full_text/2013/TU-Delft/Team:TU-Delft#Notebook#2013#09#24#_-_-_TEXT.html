24th of September
Lab work
1. Colony PCR was done for the following:
2. Restriction digestions was started for :
pSB2K3 with E+S
Lysis with E+S
3. Western Blotting was done for pT7 SUMO peptides and pBAD Ulp pT7 SUMO Signiferin.
4. The Sender receiver experiment was carried out today and checked on the Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) machine. The pBAD AIP receiver GFP Construct was induced with Arabinose (0.1%) and then induced with AIP at 1nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1µM, 10µM and 100µM. The readings on FACS didnot give any GFP signal.
This led to a re-analysis of the construct itself.
So we started to make the pBAD AIP Receiver GFP construct again.
5. Sent samples for sequencing.
