Dimitra
Having graduated from a computer science department, I am currently doing my master in bioinformatics at Leiden University and TU Delft. The challenge of engineering biological systems through rational design  in order to carry out novel processes along with the fact that synthetic biology combines many fields such as computer science, biology and mathematics, are the reasons that made me applied for iGem.I love programing and analyzing large amounts of data  by applying pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. By participating in iGem,  I'm interested in exploring how life science problems can be modeled and solved using computational methods.As for my main roles in the team, I am the modeling manager and responsible for the wiki.
