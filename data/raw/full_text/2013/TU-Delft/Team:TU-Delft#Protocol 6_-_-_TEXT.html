Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation
Gel Extraction Procedure
PCR Purification
Tricine Gels
General Peptide Production

Ligation
Requirements:
digested plasmid DNA or PCR product
T4 ligation buffer (10x) (Fermentas)
T4 ligase (Fermentas)
H2O
water bath at 16 °C
Procedure:
Ligations (pasting plasmid DNA) were performed at the appropriate temperature with the appropriate buffer in the appropriate concentration, according to the supplier.
Reaction for one sample:

T4 Ligation buffer (10×)
x μL (for 1×)
T4 Ligase
1.0 μL
H2O
x μL
10-15 μL
The final concentration is preferably ~100 ng/μL. Incubate at 16 °C for at least 3 hours. For transformation use circa half of the ligation mix.  Transform circa half of the ligation mix. Incubate at 16 °C o/n.
