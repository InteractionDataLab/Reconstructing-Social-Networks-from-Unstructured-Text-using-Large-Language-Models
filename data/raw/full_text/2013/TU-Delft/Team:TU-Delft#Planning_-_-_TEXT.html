Planning
Project 'Peptidor' deals with various cloning schemes into E.coli cells. They are made to sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and then start producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Several bio-bricks from the parts registry were used to clone the E. coli. There are many test constructs made in order to test and characterize each module. Both the detailed cloning strategies related to each module and the final constructs can be viewed in the following links:
