Lab work
1. Inoculted pT7:Maximin H5-His6 transformed in BL21 at 9.30 am for the IPTG experiment.
2. Made glycerol stocks of SUMO+Peptides and pT7:Maximin:His6. Mini prep was also carried out on all. They were sent for sequencing.
3. SUMO+peptide was restriction digestion with E+S.
4. pTET:cI:TT synthetic gene arrived today, which was transformed on XL 1 blue cells. Also, it was restriction digested with E+S.
5. BBa_p0440 (RBS:TetR:TT) was restriction digested with E+X, E+S, X+P again and run on gel.
One set of Back bone was freeze squeezed and Ethanol purification was carried out. Other set was gel extracted and purification was done.
6. Preculture of pT7:Maximin H5:His6 was inoculated for overnight culture and glycerol stocks were also made.
7. The pBAD:receiver was run on gel, and gel extraction was done, followed by Ethanol purification.
