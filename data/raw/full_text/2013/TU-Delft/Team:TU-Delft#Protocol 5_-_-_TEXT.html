Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation

Restriction digestion
Requirements:
plasmid DNA or PCR product
restriction enzymes (Roche and BioLabs)
buffer (10x)
H2O
water bath at 37 °C
heat block or water bath at 65 °C
Procedure:
Digestions (cutting plasmid DNA) were performed at the appropriate temperature with the appropriate buffer in the appropriate concentration, according to the supplier.
Reaction for one sample:
Component
Sample
DNA
x μL (up to 1,0 μg)
Buffer (10x)
x μL (for 1×)
Restriction enzymes
x μL (10 units/μg DNA = 1 µL)
H2O
x μL
20-25 μL
Buffer H (Roche): 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTE, pH 7.5 at 37 °C.
Incubate for (at least) one hour at 37 °C. Inactivate the restriction endonucleases by heat, incubation at 80°C for 10 minutes and centrifuge shortly.
