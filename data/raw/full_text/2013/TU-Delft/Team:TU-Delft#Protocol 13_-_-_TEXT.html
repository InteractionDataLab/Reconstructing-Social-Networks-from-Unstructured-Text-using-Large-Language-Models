Protocols
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense Auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing Antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus. Different protocols used during the project are described below.
Transforming Parts from Distribution kit
Growing the Single Colonies from the Agar Plates
Making glycerol stocks
Plasmid Purification Protocol
Restriction digestion
Ligation
Gel Extraction Procedure
PCR Purification
Tricine Gels
General Peptide Production
SUMO cleavage

AIP Sensing Protocol
Procedure:
Grow the cells containing the construct BBa_K1022100 (pBAD AIP Receiver GFP) overnight at 37 degrees.
Make 1/50 dilutions in LB medium of the overnight grown culture. Check for OD at 600nm till 0.1.
Then induce with 0.1% Arabinose. Keep aside samples with No Arabinose, No AIPs induction to use as control. BL21(DE3) cells and cells constitutively expressing GFP are also used as negative and positive controls.
Check the OD at 600nm till 0.5 and then induce with AIP to a final concentration of 10 µM.
After 3 hours of incubation time, check for GFP signals on the FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting).
