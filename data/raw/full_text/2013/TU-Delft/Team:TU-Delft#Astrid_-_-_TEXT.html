Because of my interest in biology, especially related to the human body, I studied Biomedical Sciences in Leiden. After I obtained my bachelor’s degree, I also wanted to explore the field of technology and chose the master track Biomedical Engineering at the TU Delft. Although I have always focused on the (dis)functioning of human  cells and tissues, this iGEM experience also makes me aware of the importance and, of course, the fun of working with micro-organisms. I have discovered that the combination of biological systems and technological applications is very interesting! Being responsible for the human practice and the PR of our project, I  hope that, besides having a cool project, we can also make more people aware of the impact of synthetic biology.
