Lab work
1. Running colony PCR on the pT7 Lysis and pcI Ulp Lysis (Batch B) which was transformed yesterday. Gel pictures are as follows:
2. Mini prep on pT7 lysis (Batch A), pBAD Ulp TT and pcI Ulp was done.   3. Transformations of pcI Ulp pSB1C3, pTet:cI:TT pSB1C3, Lysis pSB1C3 on XL 1 blue cells.
4. Ligations was done for the following:
       pBAD + AIP receiver
       pT7 SUMO Peptide + pcI Ulp
5. Bradford assay was done. But it was negative. Column purification was done.
6. Ligations were carried out on pT7 and lysis, pcI Ulp and Lysis (Batch C) as earlier the ligation calculations were dont wrong.
7. Inoculated pT7 Lysis (Batch B) colony 2 plate, colony 1 plate 3 and pcI Ulp (Batch B) colony 1,2 plate 1.
