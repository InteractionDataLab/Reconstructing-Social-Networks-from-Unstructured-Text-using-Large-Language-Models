Lab work
1. MIC determination experiment results were convincing enough for Signiferin and two synthetic peptides. Today MIC determination was done for synthetic peptide 'Joepini Maith'.
2.The pBAD:AgrA:AgrC:pP2 was transformed, mini prepped and sent for sequencing.
3. Synthetic genes arrived today for pT7:RBS:Maximin, SUMO-Magainin II, SUMO-Signiferin and SUMO-Maximin H5. These were dissolved and transformed into XL1 Blue cells and plated on KANr plates.
4. Restriction digestion on the pBAD:AgrA:AgrC:pP2 was done with S+P.
5. Inoculated BBa_p0440 (RBS:TetR:TT) from the agar plates in LB Broth to get pSB1C3 backbone.
