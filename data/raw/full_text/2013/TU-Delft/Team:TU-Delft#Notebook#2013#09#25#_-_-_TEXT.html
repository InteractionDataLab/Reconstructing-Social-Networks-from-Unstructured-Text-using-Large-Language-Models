Lab work
1. Colony PCR was done for the following:
Inoculated  colonies 1 and 4.
2. Restriction digestions was started for :
pTet cI TT pcI Ulp (col 1) with X+P
Lysis pSB1C3 with S+P
BBa_I746008 (for pSB2K3) with E+S
Lysis pSB1C3 with E+S
3. Restriction digestions which were running was put on gel:
4. Sender receiver experiment was done with the existing construct, but it was a failure.
5. Colony PCR of the pBAD AIP receiver GFP was done but no bands were seen. This proved that the construct was faulty.
Ligation was started again to make the construct.
