Lab work
1. pT7 which was restriction digested with S+P and X+P was heated to 80°C and 65°C respectively to deactivate the enzymes. CIP treatment was carried out at 37°C for 1 hour to remove one phosphate from the 5-prime end of the pT7.
2. Made 10X PC Buffer for Minimal media and startvation media.
3. Carried out transformations for pConst-AgrAC-pP2-GFP in XL1 Blue cells. Plated on Ampicillin plates.
