General Concepts
Our project deals with E.coli cells which sense auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) from the Staphylococcus aureus and starts producing antimicrobial peptides in order to kill the Staphylococcus aureus.
But why do we want to kill the Staphyllococcus? What is MRSA?
Click on the video to learn more.
The auto-inducing peptides are involved in inter-species communication in gram-positive bacteria. Many of these peptides are exported by dedicated systems, post translationally modified in various ways, and finally sensed by other cells via membrane-located receptors that are part of two-component regulatory systems. Auto-inducing peptide-based quorum sensing systems are displayed by various gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus .
