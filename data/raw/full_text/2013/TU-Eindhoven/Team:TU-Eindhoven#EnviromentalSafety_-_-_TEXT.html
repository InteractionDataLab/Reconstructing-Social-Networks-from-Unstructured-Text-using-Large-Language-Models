Environmental Safety
According to the EPA E. coli K-12 strains are quiet unlikely to represent any danger to animals, plants and microorganisms. In our particular case, given the safeguards that we have implemented, our GMOs are still safe to the environment. Moreover all our protocols and experiments were carefully planned and executed. There was limited  exposure of our genetically modified organisms to the outside environment due to the containment and safety rules followed while working at the bio-lab.
