Biosensor Fine-tuning
Introduction
Here we take biosensor HbpR as an example to demonstrate how our fine-tuning improves the performance of our biosensors. We constructed Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) based on single molecule kinetics and simulated the performance of our biosensors under different Pc and RBS strength with the steady state solution of the ODEs.
Figure1.Genetic regulation circuit of the biosensor HbpR.
Construction of ODEs
The genetic regulation circuit is shown in figure 1 HbpR is constitutively expressed under the constitutive promoter(Pc). When the cell is exposed to its inducer X, HbpR can bind to X and form a complex HbpRX. Considering cooperation may exists in this binding reaction, the steady state concentration of HbpRX can be written as
Where KH is a constant and nH is the Hill coefficient of this reaction.
HbpRX is an active state, which can activate its promoter PHbpR. We assume that there are a small proportion of HbpR can change into an active state without binding to its inducer X. Therefore, the concentraion of HbpR in active state(HbpRA) can be writen as
Where α is the proportion of HbpR in active state without binding to X.
HbpRA can bind to its promoter PHbpR and initiate the transcription. Concerning the number of HbpRA is much larger than the number of PHbpR the concentration of HbpRAPHbpR complex satisfies
Where kP1 and kP2 are the reaction rate constants of forward and reverse reactions.
The concentration of mRNA satisfies
Where Am and Dm are constants.
The concentraion of mRNA ribosome complex(mRNArib) satisfies
Where kRBS1 is the reaction rate constant of the forward reaction which is influened by the RBS strength and kR2 is the reaction rate constant of the reverse reaction.
The concentration of sfGFP satisfies
Where AG and DG are constants.
The fluorescence can be written as
Where AF is a constant.
We deduced the steady state solution of the ODEs above

Constitutive Promoter Fine-tuning
The performance of the HbpR biosensor under different constitutive promoters are simulated by changing the parameter[HbpR](the concentration of HbpR), which variates under different strength of constitutive promoters(Pc).
The modeling result(Figure 2) shows that the fluorescence increaces as the Pc strength increaces. But a medium strength of Pc gives the highest induction ratio.

RBS Fine-tuning
The performance of the HbpR biosensor under different ribosome binding sites(RBSs) are simulated by changing the parameter KRBS, which is determined by the strength of RBS.
The modeling result(Figure 3) shows that the fluorescence increaces as the RBS strength increaces. But a medium strength of RBS gives the highest induction ratio.

Why Medium Strength?
Both experimental and modeling result shows that a medium strength of Pc and RBS gives the highest induction ratio. The reason is that a medium strength balances differet leakages. Either too strong or too weak strength will aggravate the influence of a kind of leakage.
When the strength of Pc is too weak, the induction effect is too weak compared with the leakage of promoter PHbpR. When the strength of Pc is too strong, the concentration of HbpR in active state without inducer binding is high enough to saturate the promoter PHbpR (Figure 4).
When the strength of RBS is too weak, the induced fluorescence is overwhelmed by the basal fluorescence. When the strength of RBS is too strong, the translation rate will be saturated by the leakage of promoter PHbpR (Figure 5).
Figure 4. Schematic plots to show why medium strength of Pc gives the highest induction ratio. In the left plot, the dose-response curve of HbpR in active state (HbpRA) under different Pc are plotted in different colors and the lower and upper bounds are denoted in a and b. The right plot shows mRNA expression level in different lower and upper bounds. The induction ratio can be calculated by dividing the fluorescence at b point by the fluorescence at a point.
Figure 5. Schematic plots to show why medium strength of RBS gives the highest induction ratio. In the left plot, the lower and upper bound of mRNA expression level are denoted in a and b. The right plot shows the dose-response curves of mRNA under different RBSs. The induction ratio can be calculated by dividing the fluorescence at b point by the fluorescence at a point.

*Parameters are determined from curve fitting. Because the experimental data of Pc fine-tuning and data of RBS fine-tuning are measured in different experiments, KF and BasalFluorescence has different value in Pc and RBS simulation.
