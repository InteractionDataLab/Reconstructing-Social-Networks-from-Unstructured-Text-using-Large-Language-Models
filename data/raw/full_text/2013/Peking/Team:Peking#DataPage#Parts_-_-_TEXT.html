XylS Main Page-BBa_K1031911 XylS is a σ70-dependent transcriptional factor that activates Pm promoter when benzoate acid or its derivative is present. It is used to build a XylS biosensor circuit. Adaptor for this biosensor will improve the performance of XylS in detection. Visit Wiki
HbpR Main Page-BBa_K1031300 HbpR is a σ54-dependent transcriptional factor, which activates PC promoter in the presence of 2-hydroxybiphenol or 2-aminobiphenol.  We built a HbpR biosensor circuit and fine-tuned its performance in E.coli. Visit Wiki
NahF Main Page-BBa_K1031620 NahF is the salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase to convert salicylaldehyde into salicylic acid (salicylate) using NAD+. We tested NahF in E.coli and showed that the NahF works as an Adaptor for the NahR biosensor NahR , significantly improving the performance and range of detection. Visit Wiki
Hybrid Promoter Main Page-BBa_K1031021 The hybrid promoter was constructed for Band-pass Filter. The reporter sfGFP was controlled by both the activator and the inhibitor at the same time. We tested this hybrid promoter and built a model to describe its performance. Visit Wiki
NahR Main Page-BBa_K1031610 Pre-existing Part: Main Page-BBa_J61051 BBa_K1031610 is upgraded from original part BBa_J61051.  NahR is a transcription factor mined from Pseudomonas putida which binds to nah and sal promoters to activate transcription in response to the inducer salicylate. We constructed a Psal/NahR biosensor circuit using sfGFP as reporter gene and systematically characterized its performance . Adaptor of this biosensor not only improves the detection efficiency but also expands the detection profile. Visit Wiki

Figure 1. The aromatics spectrum showing the aromatics-sensing profiles of our individual biosensors. Each color segment in the central spectrum represents the detection profile of a biosensor. Structural formulas highlighted in color stand for the aromatic compounds that can be detected by our biosensors. The "plug" icon stands for Adaptors , enzymes that convert the undetectable compounds into the detectable compounds, thus to reinforce the detection capacity of some biosensors.

Figure 2. Linear fitting of the data obtained from the orthogonality assay showing the orthogonality between the 4 representative biosensors. The experiments and data processing were performed as described in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.The black dashed line denotes slope=1 as the reference line. These fittings showed the orthogonality between biosensors, (a, b) XylS and NahR; (c, d) XylS and HbpR; (e, f) NahR and HbpR, (g, h) XylS and DmpR, (i, j) NahR and DmpR, and (k, l) HbpR and DmpR.
