Achievements
We are very proud of the many achievements we have made in this summer. Here is a compilation of our feats! 1. We collaborated with and helped 5 other iGEM teams by sharing DNA materials, characterizing their parts and modeling! (For more details, Click Here ) 2. We outlined in details a new approach of human pratice called "Model iGEM". It's a small-scale competition-free jamboree for several teams that frequently communicate with each other. (For more details, Click Here ) 3. We submitted 56 high-quality and well-characterized Standard Biobricks!  (For more details, Click Here ) 4. We improved a previous Biobrick Part, which is the combination of salicylic acid inducible promoter pSal and its transcriptional regulator NahR ( BBa_J61051 ). The improved version of the Biobrick is BBa_K1031610 . 5. We invented a conceptually novel method to mine high-quality Biobricks using the genomic and proteomic database.  (For more details, Click Here ) 6. We successfully constructed a collection of biosensors to detect aromatic compounds; the detailed characterization showed that they could be combined to profile aromatics in the environment. (For more details, Click Here ) 7. We constructed a set of conceptually novel genetic devices, Adaptors, for our biosensors to improve their performance. (For more details, Click Here ) 8. A Band-pass Filter was constructed to achieve quick analysis of the environmental samples. (For more details, Click Here ) Therefore, we believe that we deserve a Gold Medal Prize.
