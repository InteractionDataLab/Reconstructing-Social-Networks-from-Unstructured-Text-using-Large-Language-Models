To meet this requirement, the detection process should be fast and the result should be easily read by naked eyes. Furthermore, the device we design to realize all these should be readily portable. 

When designing such a portable user-friendly device, the most challenging part would be developing the preservation method. As we choose <I>Escherichia coli</I>, which is unable to germinate spores, as our host strain, special method should be developed to protect the bacteria from temperature changes and physical stress while keeping them alive. We used alginate encapsulation as a basic solution to this problem and built advanced device based on such preliminary design to measure the concentration of aromatics in samples.<SUP>[5]</SUP></P><H2 id="Alginate Encapsulation" style="position: reative; top:20px;">Alginate Encapsulation</H2><FIELDSET><LEGEND><B>Figure 1.</B> The structure of alginate and the cross-link between encapsulation product.
      </LEGEND><P>Alginate is a polysaccharide consisting of β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G) residues. When exposed to calcium irons, G residues will immediately cross-link to form a gel-like material that may serve as a matrix to safely contain our biosensors.
 Alginate has been frequently used as the biological encapsulation material for various organisms such as <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli</I> and mammalian cells<SUP>[1][2]</SUP>. It stands out because of several distinct characteristics<SUP>[8]</SUP>:
(1) Stable and inexpensive, even edible.
(2) Does not interfere with biosensors we constructed.
(3) Ease to shape and manipulate.
(4) Provide reliable protection against environmental stresses.
The alginate encapsulation successfully solve the problem of lethal dehydration and oxidation stress upon our biosensor strains, so no recovering process is required. 
If additional protective agents were applied, the biosensor strains may be preserved at 4℃ for more than a month. 
     </P><P style="position:relative; top:30px; width:800px;left:100px;"><B>Experimental protocol:</B>
	1.5% Alginate solution was boiled and kept warm at 40°C.
	E.coli was grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C in 15 ml Falcon tube, then were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and then resuspended in 500 μl of fresh LB media. mixed with 3 ml alginate solution, and dropped into 0.2M calcium chloride in room temperature(20 to 24℃) to form bead-like alginate encapsulation.
	Alginate beads were washed in PBS to eliminate calcium irons and then stored in the solution with protective agents or drilled-water.

A possible way to counteract the osmotic stress is to accumulate non-toxic solutes in cytoplasm to maintain a high osmotic pressure, stablize proteins and balance the dehydration in the environment<SUP>[4]</SUP>. Inositol suits this purpose well due to its stability and hydrophilicity. And this was corroborated by work done by Aitor. et al.

To obtain a high validity maintainance, the protective agents’ we use were of ralatively high concentration, so we should test that the induction process was not interfered by the protecting agents. A series inositol and trehalose solutions of different concentration were tested.

 so the bacteria were likely to survive for more than 10 days.

This method would be multi-purposes including aromatic detection in a quantitative view, possibility of the cell communication serving the idea of adaptor, and potential for the application of bandpass filter by constructing a inducer concentration gradient.
</P><P style="position: reative; top:20px;left:100px;"><B>PDMS Template Design</B>
PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane) is particularly known for its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. PDMS is optically clear, and, in general, inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable. PDMS is a material with no marked harmful effects on organisms in the environment, which is frequently used in the microfluridic chips.
The parallel wells were etched on PDMS, using a PDMS template in which 500 μm×500 μm square patterns are microfabricated and equidistant from each other by 500 μm. The depth of the wells was 170μm. This design was aiming at prevent interaction of E.coli between different suqares, because the interaction may influence the diffusion process for constucting a concentration gradient. Addtionally, the shape could be altered according to the basal level and detection convenience<SUP>[5]</SUP>. <B>Pattern Transferring</B>
The alginate solution and bacterial culture mixture(described in the protocol of alginate encapsulation) was transferred in the wells. After treated with Calcium irons, the PDMS with the mixture was transferred to a agarose layer. (Its concentration is of 1.5% or 2%) In 5 minutes, the PDMS template was peeled off with the cell patterns left on the agarose substrate.<B>Improvements</B>
For adaptors, the adaptor E.coli cells could be encapsulated in the agarose layer. Then if the substrate of adaptor exist, it would be tranferred into the inducer which could be dected by corresponding biosensor.
For the bandpass filter, the agarose layer could be pre-treated, that sample and water was drilled on each side of the agarose layer. After 6 to 12 hours treatment, a concentration gradient would be constructed by diffusion.
(The diffusion time could be calculated according to the mass of inducers and the concentration of agarose layer.)
  </P><LEGEND><B>Figure 8.</B> The design and experiment protocol of hydrogel patterning and transferring method. This method is potential for conducting cell communication and semi-quantitative detection. 
</LEGEND><P id="Results">Results</P><LEGEND><B>Figure 9.</B> The primary attempt to construct the advanced device. 100μM 4-MeSaA was dropped on the left side of PDMS, then the plate was incubated in 37℃ for 6 hours. It's shown that a concentration was constructed and the response could be detected by blue LED. For the transferred patterning, This experiment also indicated that even with the PMDS adhered, the biosensor could be induced within a relative short time.</LEGEND><H1 id="Potentials">Potentials</H1><P style="position: reative; top:20px;"> The advanced device design has potentials for the entire aroamtic toolkit’s application. Various biosensors could be encapsulated by the same method, and the agarose layer may also encapsulate another kind of biosensor, or the adaptor bacterial cells. As the fact that the communication between the agarose layer and alginate is fast, it’s possible to conduct multi-sensor assay by this device. It’s also applicable for the adaptors.

Different concentration gradient could be constructed on the agarose layers. More tests are required to obtain the diffusion constant and this parameter could be used to calculate the diffusion time. After determine the pre-treating time, the alginate encapsulation of bandpass filter would be applied to this device. If the concentration of each square pattern could be calculated, then the bandpass filter would show response in different position. Then we may roughly read out the concentration by the response position. This approach would provide an opportunity for in field aromatic detection. </P><P style="position:relative;top:35px;"><B>References</B>
