The Peking 2013 iGEM team have been focusing on the aromatic pollution in China. First, we conducted a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness of aromatic pollution and its detection. Then we ran an on-the-spot investigation in a printing factory , which uses dyes and intermediates containing aromatic pollutants. Afterwards, we carried a practical analysis by testing the water sample from Weiming Lake on campus. Inheriting the tradition of the Peking iGEM, we guided an iGEM HS team , which will participate the jamboree in 2014.  On September 7th, we held the Model iGEM , which was a academic simulation of the iGEM jamboree that allowed participants to communicate with each other and warm up for the regional jamboree.
