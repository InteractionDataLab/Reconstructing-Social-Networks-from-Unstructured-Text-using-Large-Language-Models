Objetives
The project will focus on the development of a specific water biosensor, but with a modular and scalable approach. Thereby you could easily afford multiple measurements with the very same device.
The device will be designed in a way that its collected data will be easily accessible via a web interface, and later it could be transferred to the relevant agencies upon request.
At the end of this project we expect to have a prototype of measuring device and a diagram of a system for the distribution, collection and centralization of data.
The project will focus on the measurement of a primary pollutant: arsenic. However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to incorporate various contaminants already identified, such as nitrate / nitrite, lead and hydrocarbons.
With the data collected is expected that any user with minimal training (with an image-based Instruction) could easily and quickly determine the presence and level of the contaminant on his water consumption. Also with the systematic use of this tool by the enforcement authorities, specific public policies could be implemented based on current and reliable information.
