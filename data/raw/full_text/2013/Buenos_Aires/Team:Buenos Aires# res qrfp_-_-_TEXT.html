From 2013.igem.org
Two 100 ml culture of EColi DH5alfa carrying a plasmid with a mRFP generator under arsenite sensitive promoter ( Bba_K1106003 ) where grown at 30°C until they reach OD=0.4 (600nm). At this point arsenite was added (10ppb and 1000ppb of arsenite final concentration in each other) fluorescence was measured every 30 minutes for 8 hours with a fluorimeter at 584 nm excitation peak and 607 nm emission peak. All these data was normalized by the culture density measured by OD.
