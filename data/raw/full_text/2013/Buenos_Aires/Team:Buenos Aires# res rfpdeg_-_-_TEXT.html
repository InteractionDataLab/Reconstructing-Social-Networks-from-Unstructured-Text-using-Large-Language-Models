GFP under Arsenite Inducible Promoter ( Bba_K1106004 )
Objective
Characterize the response of the arsenite sensitive promoter measuring GFP production upon different arsenite concentrations.
Methods
Several cultures carrying a plasmid that encodes GFP under this promoter( Bba_K1106004 ) were grown overnight with different arsenite concentration (0, 10, 50, 500 and 1000 ppb). After sonication, fluorescence was measured at 395nm excitation peak and 515nm emission peak. Each measure was normalized by culture density (OD 600nm).
Results
As shown in the graphics below GFP production increases with the arsenite concentration.
Conclusion
The promoter is sensitive to different arsenite concentrations. Furthermore, we can discern among the critical arsenite concentrations according to the World Health Organisation.
