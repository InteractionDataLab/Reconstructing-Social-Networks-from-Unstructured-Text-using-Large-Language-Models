To achieve that, we first had to linearize the curve. As the curve seems to fit a logarithmic function, we aplied a logarithmic transformation to the original data, setting 1,6 as the base and the value of fluorescence at 608 nm/OD as the exponent. This way, we got a good linear fit, and used the function obtained to estimate arsenite concentration from values of fluorescence at 608 nm/OD.
</P><P>We then compared our method to an commonly used method for arsenic detection (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, AAS). the results show that, despite pArs_mRFP construct is not as precise as AAS, it can be used as a method to indicate the arsenic concentration at different ranges (and that is what we actually need!).

This was done twice and the culture was returned to 37ºC incubation. 1 ml of this culture was taken every 12 hours for the following 4 days. Finally, fluorescence was measured.

</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>As it can be seen in the pictures below, a difference in the colour production can be clearly distinguished between different arsenite concentrations after 24 hours of induction and between the higher arsenite concentrations only. It can also be observed that over time the production grows and that after 62 hours the difference between 200 and 1000ppb is not clear.

</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Overall_conclusions"><B>Overall conclusions</B></SPAN></H2><P>mRFP production responds efficiently under inducible conditions, both over time and different arsenite concentrations. The mRFP stability is acceptable for the aim of our Project. However, the visibility to the naked eye is not sufficient at low arsenite concentrations. 
We reached to the conclusion that, in order to increase the colour production at lower arsenite concentrations, a signal amplification system has to be added. It could also be added some switch to stop the production and avoid saturation of all the samples, and thus keep the range of colour observable to the naked eye.
