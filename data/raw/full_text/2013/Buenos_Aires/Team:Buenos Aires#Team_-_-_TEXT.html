Objectives
The project will focus on the development of a specific water biosensor , but with a modular and scalable approach. Thereby you could easily afford multiple measurements with the very same device.
The device will be designed in a way that its collected data will be easily accessible via a web interface, and later it could be transferred to the relevant agencies upon request.
At the end of this project we expect to have a prototype of measuring device and a diagram of a system for the distribution, collection and centralization of data.
The project will aim on the measurement of a primary pollutant: arsenic . However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to incorporate various contaminants already identified, such as nitrate / nitrite, lead and hydrocarbons.
With the data collected is expected that any user with minimal training (using an image-based Instruction given) could easily and quickly determine the presence and level of the contaminant on his water. Also with the systematic use of this tool by the enforcement authorities, specific public policies could be implemented based on current and reliable information.
Motivation
Limited access to clean water is a deep problem and tends to worsen with time. The pollution that converts water in non-drinkable can vary from just a single toxic (eg arsenic) to a highly complex mixture of types of substances such as those found in various river basins (eg Sali-Dulce, Matanza-Riachuelo among others).
Depending on the type of contamination (complexity and abundance),  making  the water to be drinkable could be easy and inexpensive. Even if it weren't possible to make it drinkable, information on pollutant levels could be easily used to modify consumption patterns and seek alternative sources of water.
At present, the spatial and temporal quantification of contaminants is limited by the difficulty in processing the samples and associated costs. Moreover, the lack of centralization and systematization of data does the task of obtain them by decision makers, stakeholders and the general public, very difficult.

I love science since I was a child. Although I always knew  that I was going to study natural science, I wasn´t so sure about the election of my carreer. Fortunately at the end of the high school the answer came to me. I participated in the biology olympiads and then I realised that I would be happy studying biology. I've decided to participate in IGEM because it's a great way of learning new things. It's great because you learn in group: with the other guys and from the other guys. But science is not my only one love, i must confess that I have a romance with music. I've been singing in choirs since I was very young and I hope to do it for the rest of my life.
