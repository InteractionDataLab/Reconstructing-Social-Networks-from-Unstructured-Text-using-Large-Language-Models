To drink or not to drink: home kit for the detection of pollutants in water
Our Objetive
We are building a water biosensor, but with a modular and scalable approach. Thereby you could easily afford multiple measurements with the very same device.
The project will focus on the measurement of a primary pollutant: arsenic. However, its design provides an easy way to incorporate various contaminants already identified, such as nitrate / nitrite, lead and hydrocarbons.
We aim to build a home kit, so people could use it without any previus knowledge or science background.
