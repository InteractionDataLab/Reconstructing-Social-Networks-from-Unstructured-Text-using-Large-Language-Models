Team:Buenos Aires/ outreach
From 2013.igem.org
Lecture in Saint Roman High School
On the morning of 5th August, members of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Saint Román High School. They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students and helped them comprehend how molecular biology works. Afterwards, they played a game in which the students had to think and design a genetic machine for a specific problem. They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.
Introducing synthetic biology to the Argentinian scientific community
As part of our aim to make the community aware of this deep problem, we participate in an multidisciplinary scientific meeting called Garage Lab. This for us was a great opportunity to share both our biological design and mathematical model and the general Arsenic contamination problem with trained professionals of various scientific fields.  This was also a chance of spreading the SynBio technology in the science professional world.
Lecture in Instituto Oral Modelo for death students
On 30 th August, three members of our iGEM team went to Instituto Oral Modelo in order to explain what molecular biology  and Synthetic biology are. we also did some experiments with them: one of them was to extract DNA from a banana using only shampoo, salt and alcohol.
