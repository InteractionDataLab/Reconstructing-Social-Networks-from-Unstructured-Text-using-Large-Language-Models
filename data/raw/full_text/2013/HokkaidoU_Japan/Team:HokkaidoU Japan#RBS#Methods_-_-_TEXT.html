RBS
RBS family parts
We constructed new RBS family, SD2, SD4, SD6, SD8.   These RBSs have enhancer sequence (GCTCTTTAACAATTTATCA) and SD sequence (SD2:GG, SD4:GAGG, SD6:AGGAGG, SD8:TAAGGAGG).   We constructed SD8 from synthetic oligos (forward:SD8-f, reverse:SD8-r).   We constructed SD2, SD4, SD6 by PCR (forward:EX-f, reverse:SD2-r, SD4-r, SD6-r, template:SD8).

Assay
We ligated TetR repressible promoter (pTet), each of the new RBSs', LacZα and double terminator.   Using this construct we performed β-Galactosidase assay.
