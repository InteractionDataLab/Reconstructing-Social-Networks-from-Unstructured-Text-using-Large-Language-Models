Overview
Project Description
Recently, more and more projects for iGEM involve precisely regulated systems or multistep catalysis. These biological systems need to have
transparent structure
reliable function
reproducibility
and be safe
Especially parts controlling gene expression such as promoters or RBSs, it is desired that their prospective functions are explainable.
This year, we  made well-selected sets of promoters and RBSs with dynamic range of strength. We mutated a -35 region of a promoter to make a family of various promoters. And for RBS, we added an enhancer upstream of RBS and change the SD sequence to make a various RBS family. These parts were strictly evaluated.
Our project is making the Random Operon Shuffling Kit which enables you to select the most suitable promoters and RBSs for your project. We succeeded in making this kit! It can be accomplished in only one step. This kit will help other iGEMers create more complex and effective devises.
We also did presentation at our university and two high schools about iGEM and synthetic biology. On that occasion we get to know what the people think about gene recombination by means of questionnaires. We tried to provide them with information for deeper thought. We hope these activities will lead the society where people are more accepting genetic engineering.
