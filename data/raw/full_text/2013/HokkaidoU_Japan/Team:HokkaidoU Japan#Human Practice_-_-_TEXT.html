Overview
HokkaidoU_JAPAN is located at Sapporo, Hokkaido, the northeast part of Japan. In Japan, there are several iGEM teams, but, in Hokkaido, there is the only one iGEM team. It is us, HokkaidoU_JAPAN! Hokkaido is a prosperous agricultural island. So citizen in Hokkaido are so sensitive to gene recombination. Because of such a background, we are feeling our responsibility to harmonize people in Hokkaido with gene recombination.
To achieve this mission, we conducted some activities as human practice.
Our Activity
Taking questionnaires from citizen in Hokkaido, including from children to adults, in order to research citizen’s knowledge and interests in synthetic biology and gene recombination.
Giving presentations to show citizen in Hokkaido accurate knowledge of synthetic biology and DNA.
Introducing "what iGEM is?" to citizen in Hokkaido.
To put this into practice,
We participated in University Festival in Hokkaido University and visited two high schools.
