iGEM Prizes
We deserve following prizes
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach
Best New Standard
There are many wonderful iGEM projects about interesting proteins which focused on the "quality". However, we think focusing  on the "quantity" is also an important factor. This year, made a new standard to select the promoter and RBS. By using this, we can optimize the expression of protein in just one step. We released a new RFC.       We also made new, Promoter family and RBS family.
