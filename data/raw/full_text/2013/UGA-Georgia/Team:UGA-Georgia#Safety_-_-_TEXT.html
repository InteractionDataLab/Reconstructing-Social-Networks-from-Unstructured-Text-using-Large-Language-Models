Official safety form submission is viewable at: [1]
Our project shows no concerns with the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Our work involves using methanogens and  reproducing geraniol, both of which pose no threat to the environment, and pose no threat to human or animal health.
"Safety forms were approved on 9/18/13 by David Lloyd and Julie McNamara."
