Outreach
Our research has many promising outcomes in the society; from the production of a super compound, geraniol, that is a possible bio-fuel, cancer growth inhibitor and insect repellent, to the creation of novel gene regulation tools that will allow Archaea to be more accessible in the field of synthetic biology. We truly have a passion for research and the field of synthetic biology, and we wanted share this passion with others.
Engineering Seminar
On September 12, 2013, members of the iGEM team presented their findings at an engineering seminar in the UGA engineering department. Our presentation provided UGA undergraduates and graduate students an opportunity to learn more about the importance of our research, as well as the general field of biological engineering. We presented at this convention with the intent to raise awareness of our research and get more people involved in the field of synthetic biology.
