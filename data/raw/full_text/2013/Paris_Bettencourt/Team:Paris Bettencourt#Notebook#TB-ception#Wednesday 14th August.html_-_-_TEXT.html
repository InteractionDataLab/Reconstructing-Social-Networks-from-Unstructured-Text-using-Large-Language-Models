Wednesday 14th August
Streak plate and liquid cultures for M. smegmatis and E. coli BL21 + pET21b. We started a plate reading experiment in order to see which concentrations of nalidixic acid should we use in our selective media. The tested concentrations were: 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25,3.125, 1.5625, 0.78125, 0.390625, 0.1953125, 0.09765625, 0.048828125 μg/mL. We also tested different concentrations of IPTG, to see which ones induce the strain without killing it. The tested concentrations were: 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.015625, 0.0078125, 0.00390625, 0.001953125, 0.0009765625  μg/mL. The concentration of bacteria in each well was 1 % and the bl21 culture of O.D. = 0.5 was used.
