ASDF
Saturday 14th September
Fresh liquid cultures for: M smegmatis pMyC-GFP (kanamycine resistance) , M smegmatis, E.coli Bl21 carrying pET21b-TDMH and pColA-RFP (ampicilin and kanamycine resistances) and E.coli Bl21 carrying pET21b-TDMH, pColA RFP and pACyC-hly (ampicilin, kanamycine and chloramphenicol resistances)
• CaCl2 competent cells for NEB Turbo - 25 mL of the culture (O.D. 1), 3 washing steps (1o min, 4 000 rpm, on 4.0). For the first one - 100 mM MgCl2, for the second - 100 mM CaCl 2, after the last one the cells were resuspended in CaCl2 + glycerol. I've also made electrocompetent cells (3 washes in dH20).
• cloning biobricked TDMH in the linear backbone - protocol from the 12th of September. New competent cells and new Chl plates.
• pET+pSB3C5 worked - miniprep; repeated the Gibson for pACYC
• PCR for confirming pET+pSB3C5 - tamplet is the miniprep and the primers are pDCo4 R/F. pET Duet as the positive controle (Phusion protocol).
