TB-ception
ASDF
Saturday 17th August
Because we suspect that the culture was contaminated we repeated the experiment with 3 separate cultures. n 20 mL of LBA with 0.2 % of Tween 20 μL of the liquid culture was added (O.D. Of the culture which was inoculated was 1). O.D. And CFU were determined each 3 hours. Dilutions which were used are: 10-1 and 10-2 for time 0, 10-2 and 10-3 for 3 h, 10-5 and 10-6 for 9 h, 10-7 for 24 h. We saved some plates so we could perform acid fast staining and check if its really M. smegmatis.  We have transformed bl21 by electroporation with pET21b and with pSB1C3, so we could get RFP E. coli expressing our protein. The transformed culture was plated on plates containing ampicilline and chloramphenicol.
