Thursday 22nd August
Gel of gradient PCR product (Pictures 6,5,5), PCR purification and pooling, Digestion M13 backbone, RFP insert, Test Digestion in Gel, Gel Extraction, Liquid culture, Purification of Backbone Cloning and Miniprep sSP015.
Gel of gradient PCR product
1%, 100V, 20 min
PCR purification and pooling
Pool all samples that worked
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.

Digest for 2.5  hours at 37 °C with shaking.
Test Digestion in Gel
1%, 100V, 20 min
Gel Extraction
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix (actually only needed for very small products or very big products)
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
11. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm). 12. Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
c=13,6ng/ul
Liquid culture
sSP015
Purification of Backbone Cloning
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 30 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
Miniprep sSP015
1) Pellet 2x 2ml of liquid culture (4000rpm, 10 min)
2) Discard supernatant
3) resuspend the cells in 250ul of resuspension solution
4) add 250ul of lysis solution, mix by inverting 4-6 times
5) add 350ul of neutralization solution
4) centrifuge for 5 min
5) transfer supernatant to spin column
6) centrifuge for 1 min
7) discard flow through
8) add 500 ul wash solution and centrifuge for 1 min , discard flow through(repeat this step)
9) centrifuge for 1 min to remove left over liquid
10) transfer the column on a 1.5ml tube
11) add 50ul of elution buffer and incubate for 2 min
12) centrifuge for 2 min
13) Nanodrop the concentration and freeze at -20°
