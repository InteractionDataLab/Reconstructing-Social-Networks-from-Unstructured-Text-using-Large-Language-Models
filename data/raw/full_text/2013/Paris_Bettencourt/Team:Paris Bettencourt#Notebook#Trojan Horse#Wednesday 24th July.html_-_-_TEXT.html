24th July
Glycerol stock:
sT008: MGZ1, F+
sT009: XL1-Blue Litmus28i
Infectiveness characterization experiments
Dilute 1/100 MGZ1, F+ O/N culture in 5mL LB => wait OD(600) = 0.7
Centrifuge M13K07 4000rpm, 10 minutes
Retrieve surnageant and filter it with 0.2 filter
Once OD 0.7 is reached, make 4 tubes
1mL MGZ1,F+ + 100ul LB (not done, not enough cells left ofter OD test)
1mL MGZ1,F+ + 100ul surnageant diluted 1/100
1mL MGZ1,F+ + 100ul surnageant diluted 1/1000
1mL MGZ1,F+ + 100ul surnageant diluted 1/1000
Incube 37°C for 45 minutes
Serial dilute the tubes 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5, 10^-6
4 times 6 tubes with 900uL LB, add 100ul of one previously made tube, mix and transfert 100ul to next tube.
Plate on LB (10^-6), Kan(10^-2 and 10^-3), Amp(10^-6), Kan and Amp(10^-2 and 10^-3)
Experiment fail due to manipulation error (wrong dilution of the supernageant and plating of wrong dilutions)
Start O/N culture of MGZ1,F+ (T008) + Tet 1/500
Start O/N culture of M13K07 (T007) + Amp and Kan 1/1000
