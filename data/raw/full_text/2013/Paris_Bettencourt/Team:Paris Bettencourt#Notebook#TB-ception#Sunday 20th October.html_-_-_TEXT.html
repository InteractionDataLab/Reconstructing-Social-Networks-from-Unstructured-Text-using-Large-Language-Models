TB-ception
ASDF
Tuesday 16th October
Counting the colonies of M.smegmatis on the plates from Thursday.
We stopped because we noticed no significant difference between what was tested and the controls.
Maybe the protein wasn't extracted properly or it was extracted and inactive (denaturated)...
Also we noticed a decrease of 10-20% of the number of M.smegmatis colonies growing in all the wells with the detergent (and the proteins) (around 50microliters per well).
The very low pH (3 and 4,5) affected the growth of M.smegmatis by 20-30%
