16th July
Anne with Nico, Marguerite and Yonatan
Transformation of pUC18 (NEB, NEB CC, BL21)
1) Thaw competent cells on ice.
2) Place 20 ul of cells in a pre-chilled Eppendorf tube.
3) add o.5ul of plasmid to the cells
4) Mix gently by flicking the tube.
5) Chill on ice for 10 minutes.
4) Heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds.
5) Return to ice for 2 minutes.
6) Add 200 ul LB medium and recover the cells by shaking at 37 °C for 30 min (AmpR)
7) Plate out the cells (10 ul) on Amp LB plates as well as a control (untransformed cells)
8. Incubate at 37 °C. Transformants should appear within 12 hrs.
Result: Colonies (around 10)
