TB-ception
ASDF
Monday 5th August
We want to repeat our previous experiment, but now we will add ampicillin in the media containing the transformed strains.  We set everything as previously, did the 0 h (100 µL of 10-1 and 10-2) and 6 h measurement (100 µL of 10-1 and 10-2 for the induced strain; 100 µL of 10-1 and 10-6 for the others).
