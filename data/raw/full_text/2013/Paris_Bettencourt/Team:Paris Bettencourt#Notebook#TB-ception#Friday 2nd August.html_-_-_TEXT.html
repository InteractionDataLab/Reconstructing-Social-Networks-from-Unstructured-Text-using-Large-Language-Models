TB-ception
ASDF
Friday 2nd August
We repeated the time 6 measurement (the cultures were over diluted, so this time we did 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7). We also did the 24 h measurement (we used the 10-6, 10-7 and 10-8 dilutions). The final results are:
Growth inhibition could be noticed for the induced strain, which is probably a consequence of the over expression. The induced culture recovered and reached a greater CFU/mL value than in the previous groups. Maybe because we didn’t add any antibiotics in our media, the plasmid was lost and the culture could recover after achieving the over expression.
