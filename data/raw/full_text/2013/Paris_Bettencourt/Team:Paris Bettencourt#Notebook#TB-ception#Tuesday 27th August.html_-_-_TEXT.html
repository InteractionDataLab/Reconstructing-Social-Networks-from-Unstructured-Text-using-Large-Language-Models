TB-ception
ASDF
Tuesday 27th August
We did a digestion of J23102 and J23104 with EcoRI and with and Pstl and we gel purified the RFP gene with a constitutive promoter. We also did a digestion for pSB3C5 with the same enzymes and we did gel purification for the backbone. The ligation product was then transformed into NEB Turbo.
