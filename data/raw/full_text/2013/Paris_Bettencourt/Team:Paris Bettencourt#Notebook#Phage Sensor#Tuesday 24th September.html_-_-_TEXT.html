Gel extraction
1. Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
2. Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation.
3. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
4. Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix (actually only needed for very small products or very big products) 5. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min.
6. Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
7. To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
8. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
9. Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
10. To elute DNA, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.

Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.

Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
