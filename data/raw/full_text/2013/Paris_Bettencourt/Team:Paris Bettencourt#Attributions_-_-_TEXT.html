Overview
The students came up with and developed the project independently during several brainstorming sessions held as a part of the SynBio Club at the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity, Paris.
All of the designs, constructs, and experiments presented in this Wiki were performed by the students of the 2013 Paris Bettencourt team. The instructors and advisors were providing feedback and advice, when needed.

Host Lab
We were hosted at the CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity) located in the University Paris Descartes.  The host lab provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, PCR machines, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, a NanoDrop machine, etc.. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA. All the media preparation and the glassware washing was done by us.
None of the subjects of this project are being studied or developed in the host lab.
