ASDF
Monday 16th September
• I have to repeat the biobricking of TDMH because I didn't use the DpnI and because the linear backbone which I was using didnt have the RFP cassette. So I've repeated the PCR with the right backbone.
• Digesting the linear backbone: 10 µL plasmid, 10 µL fast digest buffer, 3 µL for EcoRI and Pstl, 1 µL od DpnI, 73 µL of dH20. 1 h, 37.0
• Ligation of the digested linear backbone and TDMH - backbone 3 µL, insert 1 µL, ligation buffer 1 µL, ligation enzyme 0.5 µL, dH2O 4.5 µL.
•A new setup for the macrophages; the protocol from the 15th of September; the groups were: macrophages alone, 2 x macrophages infected with M. smegmatis, 2 x macrophages infected with E. coli, 2 x M. smeg + E. coli uninduced, 2 x M. smeg + E. coli induced overnight, 2 x M. smeg + E. coli induced for 2 h. We also scratched the macrophages from yesterdays' setup and tried to get CFUs for them - 1 mL of the scratch (in PBS)was centrifuged (1 500 rpm, 10 min) to remove any cells which were not phagocytosed. The pallet was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and the membranes of the macrophages were lysed with 5 µL of TritonX. 100 µL of the suspension was plated on LBA plates.
