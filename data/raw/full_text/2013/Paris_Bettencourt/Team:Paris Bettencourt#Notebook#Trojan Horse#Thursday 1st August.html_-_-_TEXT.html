Cloning Kanamycin resistance gene into pACYCDuet-1:
-PCR of Kanamycin resistance gene from pCOLADuet-1 with primer iT.0003 and iT.0004
-electrophoresis of PCR product: 1 band between 900 and 1000bp: coherent with KanR length
-cutting KanR bands:
-digestion with ECOR1 and Xho1:
PCR product digest for cloning

Digest for 2 - 4 hours at 37 °C with shaking.
-electrophoresis of pACYCDuet-1 digestion products:
column 1: 1kb plus marker
column 2 & 3: digestion product
column 4: undigested pACYCDuet-1
nothing appear on gel after digestion, therefore we will miniprep pACYCDuet-1 and try again to digest it.
