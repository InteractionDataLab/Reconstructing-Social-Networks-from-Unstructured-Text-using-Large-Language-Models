Monday 26th August
We started a killing assay for M. smegmatis: we had two groups; in the first one the ratio between M. smegmatis and E. coli BL21 + pET21b was 1:1 and in the other it was 1:2. BL21 was induced with 1 mM IPTG in the co-culture (10 mL of LB, 0.1 mL of each strain and 0.1 mL of 100 mM IPTG). For each group a control was made - same ratio between the strains but no induction. Also we had one group with only M. smegmatis. We did dilution series for time 0, after 3 and after 6 h. We also measured the O.D. (600 nm) for each time point.
