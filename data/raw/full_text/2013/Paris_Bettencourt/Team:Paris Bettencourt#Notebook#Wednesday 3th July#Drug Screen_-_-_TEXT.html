Competent Cells : BL21 (DE3) dCysI dFpr dydbk
We grew 5ml of sD001 cells overnight from a single colony.
This 5ml was used to innoculate 500ml of LB broth.
Broth was incubated for 1.5h and optical density was read at 0.62 OD600.
Cells were alloquoted into 10 falcon tubes (50ml each) and centrifuged at 4000xg for 20 minutes at 4C.
Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 200ml of Buffer 1 (4x 50ml) and left on ice for 20 minutes.
Cells were centrifuged again for 20 minutes at 4000xg.
Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 12ml Buffer 2.
Cells were alloquoted at 500ul into microcentifuge tubes and frozen at -80C.
Buffer 1: 50mM CaCl2
Buffer 2: 0.53ml 2M CaCl2   2.8ml 60% Glycerol   8.67ml sterile H2O
