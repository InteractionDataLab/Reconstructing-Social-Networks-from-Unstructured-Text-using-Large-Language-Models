19th July
Conjugation results :
Controls => no colonies
Mix = tapis
Ie worked really well.
To be sure to start only with one clone => restreak some colonies on tet/spec plates
Transformation by electroporation : goal = get a phage factory.
We do it three different ways in order to see which one works (best).
Transform strain containing helper plasmid with phagemid
Transform strain containing helper plasmid with phagemid
Co Transform strain with both plasmids at the same time
From strain sT004, sT005, sT006
Transform sT004  with pT006
Transform sT005 with pT005
Co Transform sT006 with pT005 and pT006
Tubes :
sM13KO7 (control) : 5,60
sM13KO7 + pLitmus : 5,70
sM13KO7 + pLitmus : 5,70
sLITMUS (control) : 5,60
sLITMUS + pM13K07 : 5,60
sLITMUS + pM13K07 : 5,60
MG16165 : control = 5.70
MG16165 + p (M13K07) and p(LITMUS) = 5.60
MG16165 + p (M13K07) and p(LITMUS)= 5.60
