TB-ception
ASDF
Tuesday 20th August
We did a miniprep for the LLO plasmid (we had to do dialysis to purify the plasmid).
We observed the RFP producing cells (BL21 + pET21b + pSB3C5) under the fluorescent microscope and the cells produce RFP. We made a liquid culutre of the strain with 1 mM IPTG. We also plated them on LBA + 1 mM IPTG.
Liquid culture of M. smegmatis was made, but in the liquid culture 2 µL/mL of malachite green was added. We plated the culture on LBA + 3 µL/mL of nalidixic acid and on LBA to compare the number of colonies.
