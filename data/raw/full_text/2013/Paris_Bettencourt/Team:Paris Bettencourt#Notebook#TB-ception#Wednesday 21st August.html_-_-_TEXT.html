TB-ception
ASDF
Wednesday 21st August
Our macrophages arrived today and we are staring a cell culture! The cells with pET21b and pSB3C5 can't survive the induction with 1 mM IPTG because they have two IPTG inducable promoters. We want to use a different insert, one with an uninducable promoter, such as BBa_J23100-118.
