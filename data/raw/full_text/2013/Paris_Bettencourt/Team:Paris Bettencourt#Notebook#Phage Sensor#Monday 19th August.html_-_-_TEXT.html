PCR purification Backbone (M13mp18)
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
Ligation (RFP into M13mp18 backbone)
3ul Backbone
14 ul Insert
2ul 10x T4 DNA Ligase HC Buffer
1 ul T4 DNA Ligase
Incubate for at least 10min at 22°C
Trafo of Ligation product (RFP in M13mp18 plasmid)  into NEB turbo
1) Thaw competent cells on ice.
2) Place 20 ul of cells in a pre-chilled Eppendorf tube.
3) Add 3 ul of plasmid (from Biobrick stock)
4) Mix gently by flicking the tube.
5) Chill on ice for 10 minutes.
4) Heat shock at 42 °C for 30 seconds
5) Return to ice for 2 minutes.
6) Add 200 ul LB medium and recover the cells by shaking at 37 °C.
7) Plate out the cells on LB (200ul)
8. Incubate at 37 °C. Transformants should appear within 12 hrs.
Test Xgal
3ml of Liquid culture with
1) Xgal from iGEM 2012 (Jake) (+IPTG)
2) Xgal from last week (in DMF) (+IPTG)
