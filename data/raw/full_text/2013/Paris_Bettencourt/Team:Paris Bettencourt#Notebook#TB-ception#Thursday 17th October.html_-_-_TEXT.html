ASDF
Thursday 17th October
To study the stability of TDMH at 7 different pH we extracted it from E.coli using the kit B-PER.
We have 4 groups:
- M.smegmatis alone
- M.smegmatis + E.coli's control (producing another protein) induced
- M.smegmatis + E.coli's Bl21 (with TDMH gene) uninduced proteins
- M.smegmatis+ E.coli's Bl21 (with TDMH gene) induced proteins
We plate at time 0, 3h and 6 h using selective plates (nalidixic acid 3 micrograms/mL) and making 2 different dilutions
We had 3 wells for each condition.
We plated bacteria on 504 plates
