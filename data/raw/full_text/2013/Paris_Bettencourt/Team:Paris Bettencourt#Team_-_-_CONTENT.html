During the AIV’s first year master programme, I was afforded the opportunity to study synthetic, computational and systems biology. This allowed me to discover that new approaches in medicine can be taken using the principles of synthetic and systems biology. Such approaches are evident in our iGEM project, which I am very excited to be a part of.  Using synthetic biology, we are trying to address an age old medical problem in an innovative yet plausible way.</DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="caption"><DIV class="image-title">Iva Atanasković

There we are going to form a new iGEM team next year, so all the experiences from this internship will be very helpful. In Petnica I did several projects in microbiology, mostly regarding bioremediation technologies. I didn't have much chance to do any molecular or cellular biology, so I'm highly interested in learning new methods in this field. I also enjoy doing street art and martial arts.</DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="caption"><DIV class="image-title">Camelia Bencherif

While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek/assess the potential of an exciting upcoming field: Bio-design. Whilst investigating the friction of design with Biology, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!</DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="caption"><DIV class="image-title">Aude Bernheim

I was part for two years of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, working in bioinformatics and proteomics; and spent six months at the University of Edinburgh working on rule-based modeling. Last year I arrived to the AIV master program in Paris. My interests are related to the use of theoretical models to understand the kinetics of biochemical networks. I find Synthetic Biology exiting because its desire for precise abstractions; and its possibility for making interesting feedback between experimental design and hypothesis coming from modeling. During my free-time I like cooking, reading and dancing.</DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="caption"><DIV class="image-title"> Nicolas Koutsoubelis

As the CRI is a place for visions and future project, I am really looking forward to work with the team on a visionary project that will further form Synthetic Biology.</DIV></DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="caption"><DIV class="image-title"> Vincent Libis
