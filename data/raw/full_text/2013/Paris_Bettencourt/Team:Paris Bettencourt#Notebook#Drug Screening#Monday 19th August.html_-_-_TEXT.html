Received FrpA and FdxA from IDT.
Started cloning strategy:
Ligated FdxA G block into pJET plasmid for stock purposes, using the following protocol:
1. Set up the blunting reaction on ice:
Component
Volume
2X Reaction Buffer
10 µl
Non-purified PCR product
or
purified PCR product/other sticky-end DNA fragment
1 µl
0.15 pmol ends
Water, nuclease-free
to 17 µl
DNA Blunting Enzyme
1 µl
Total volume
18 µl
Vortex briefly and centrifuge for 3-5 s.
2. Incubate the mixture at 70°C for 5 min. Chill on ice.
3. Set up the ligation reaction on ice. Add the following to the blunting reaction mixture:
Component
Volume
pJET1.2/blunt Cloning Vector (50 ng/µl)
1 µl (0.05 pmol ends)
T4 DNA Ligase
1 µl
Total volume
20 µl
Vortex briefly and centrifuge for 3-5 s to collect drops.
4. Incubate the ligation mixture at room temperature (22°C) for 5 min.
