Glycerol Stock, Miniprep, M13 plate test, Patches
Glycerol Stock sSP018 - NEB with E1010
sSP017
sSP016
Take 1.5ml of ON culture + 500ul Glycerol (60%)
Freeze at -80°C
Miniprep
E1010
J04450
1) Pellet 2x 2ml of liquid culture (4000rpm, 10 min)
2) Discard supernatant
3) resuspend the cells in 250ul of resuspension olution
4) add 250ul of lysis solution, mix by inverting 4-6 times
5) add 350ul of neutralization solution
4) centrifuge for 5 min
5) transfer supernatant to spin column
6) centrifuge for 1 min
7) discard flow through
8) add 500 ul wash solution and centrifuge for 1 min , discard flow through(repeat this step)
9) centrifuge for 1 min to remove left over liquid
10) transfer the column on a 1.5ml tube
11) add 50ul of elution buffer and incubate for 2 min
12) centrifuge for 2 min
13) Nanodrop the concentration and freeze at -20°
J04450: ng/ul
E1010: ng/ul
M13 plate test
1) 100 μ l of plating bacteria per tube
2) Prepare tenfold serial dilutions (10-6  to 10-9 ) of the bacteriophage stock in LB
3) Put 10 μ l/ 100 μ l of each dilution to the bacteria
4)  Mix the bacteriophage particles with the bacterial culture by vortexing gently.
5) Add 40 μ l of X-gal solution (working conc) and IPTG (working conc) solution to each of the tubes
6) Add 3ml of Agar to each tube and gently vortexing for 3 seconds
7) Pour the mixture onto  plates containing LB medium supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2
8) Swirl the plate gently to ensure an even distribution of bacteria and agar.
9) Incubate them at 37°C.
Patches
check them and prepare new ones of those that haven’t been done yet
