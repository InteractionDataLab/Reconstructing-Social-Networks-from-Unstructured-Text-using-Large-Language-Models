Wednesday 28th August
Cloning from yesterday didn't work, so we will repeat everything with a different backbone. On gels for the digested pSB3C5 we couldn't see the part which was cut out, so we guess there is something wrong with this plasmid and we want to use a new one - pColaDuet-1 with a colA origin. We amplified the insert form J23102 and J23104 with biobrick verification primers and then we did PCR purification. We digested the insert and the backbone with EcoRI and Pstl and we did PCR purification for both of them. After measuring the concentration for both, we did a ligation in molar ration insert:backbone = 3:1 on 16 deg C for 1 h. The ligation product was transformed into NEB Turbo.
