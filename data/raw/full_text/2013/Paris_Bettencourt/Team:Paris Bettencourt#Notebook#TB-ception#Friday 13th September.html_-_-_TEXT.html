TB-ception
ASDF
Friday 13th September
A lot of macrophages died (in suspension) because we forgot to add glutamine and pyruvate sodium. We repeated the experiment with the complete media (but again without antibiotics).
• Results for the GA: because the Chl plates were off, I have to repeat everything for biobricking TDMH and for the pACYC derived backbone. The cloning for pCDF and pColA worked - patched the colonies, start liquid cultures.
• Launch NEB Turbo to make competent cells.
