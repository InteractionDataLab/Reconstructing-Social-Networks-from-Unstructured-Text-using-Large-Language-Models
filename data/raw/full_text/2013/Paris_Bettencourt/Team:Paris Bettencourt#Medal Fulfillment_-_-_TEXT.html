Poster and a talk for the iGEM Jamboree ready
We built, characterized, and documented several new and existing BioBrick parts
SILVER MEDAL
We experimentally validated that several new BioBrick Parts or Devices of our own design and construction work as expected.
We documented the characterization of those parts in the "Main Page" sections of those Parts/Devices Registry entries.
We submited those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. We described more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of our project on our Human Practice and Safety pages.
GOLD MEDAL
We improved the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, entered this information in the Registry, created a new registry page for the improved part, and submitted this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We collaborated with a couple of registered iGEM teams from another school or institution.
We outlined and detailed a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to our project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
