Extraction of Genomic DNA, PCR reaction, Gels, Miniprep, PCR: SPCR5, SPCR6  and Liquid culture of pS004’ and pS013’
Protocol: E. coli Colony PCR (pS006, pS013’,pS013*,  pS004’, pS002’)
Extraction of Genomic DNA
1) Pick a single colony into 50 ul of H20.
Fresh colonies (grown that day) work best, but they can also come from 4 C.
Pipet 2ul onto plates to have C1-C8
2) Boil for 5 minutes.
1.5 ul of this can be used directly for PCR.
Best if used directly, but can also be stored at 4 C for a few days.
PCR Reaction
Keep all the reagents at 4 °C while preparing the mixture.
Pre-heat the thermocycler to 95 °C and transfer your reaction directly from 4 °C.

13/09/30_colony pcr_pS004_pS013 - 1-8: pS004 (gRNA - Amp), 9-16: pS013 (crRNA - Amp) - seems to have worked beside pS013 C7
13/09/30_colony PCR_pS004*_pS002* - 1-8: pS004* (gRNA - Amp), 9-16: pS002 (reporter - Amp) - pS004* seems to have worked (C1, C2, C3, C6)
13/09/30_colony PCR_pS006'_pS006* - 1-8: pS006' (Cas9 - Chl), 9-16: pS006* (Cas9 - Amp) - didn’t work
13/09/30_Colony PCR_pS013'_pS013* - 1-8: pS013' (crRNA - Chl), 9-16: pS013* (crRNA - Amp) - Seems to have worked beside 13’ C7, C8
13/09/30_colony PCR_pS004'_pS002' - 1-8: pS004' (gRNA - Chl), 9-16: pS002' (reporter - Chl) - pS004' seems to have worked beside C6
13/09/30_Colony PCR_pS006 - didn’t work
other gel images that proof that the reporter as well as the Cas9 construct worked will follow soon!
Miniprep
pS013, pS004
1) Pellet liquid culture (4000rpm, 10 min)
2) Discard supernatant
3) resuspend the cells in 250ul of resuspension olution
4) add 250ul of lysis solution, mix by inverting 4-6 times
5) add 350ul of neutralization solution
4) centrifuge for 5 min
5) transfer supernatant to spin column
6) centrifuge for 1 min
7) discard flow through
8) add 500 ul wash solution and centrifuge for 1 min , discard flow through(repeat this step)
9) centrifuge for 1 min to remove left over liquid
10) transfer the column on a 1.5ml tube
11) add 50ul of elution buffer and incubate for 2 min
12) centrifuge for 2 min
13) Nanodrop the concentration and freeze at -20°
