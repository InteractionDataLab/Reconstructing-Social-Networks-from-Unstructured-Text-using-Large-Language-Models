FIGHT TUBERCULOSIS WITH MODERN WEAPONS
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that affects nearly two billion people around the world. On this website we present four new ways to use the power of synthetic biology in the fight against TB: from gene detection, to drug targeting, to infiltrating macrophages, to sabotaging the synthesis of proteins. Hover over these panels to see the project overview.
A biosensor that detects the presence of sequence specific antibiotic resistance genes.
A safe and specific high-throughput drug screening method that targets essential mycobacterial metabolic proteins.
A phage system with low fitness cost producing sRNA, which inhibits the synthesis of antibiotic resistance proteins.
Infiltrate macrophages with an E.coli producing TDMH, an enzyme that will lyse the Mycobacteria cell wall.
