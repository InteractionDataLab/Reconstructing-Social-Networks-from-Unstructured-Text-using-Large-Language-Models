TB-ception
ASDF
Monday 2nd September
Transformed BL21 + pET21b with pColA + J23102/104 (electroporation and heat shock), transformed BL21 + pET21b with pColA + J23102/104 and with the LLO plasmid.  The PCR for the pET21b worked and we've sent it for sequencing; the PCR for the LLO plasmid didn't work :(
