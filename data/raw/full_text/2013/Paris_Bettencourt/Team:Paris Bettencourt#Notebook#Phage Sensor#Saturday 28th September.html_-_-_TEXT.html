Extraction of Genomic DNA, PCR Reaction and Restreak plates
Protocol: E. coli Colony PCR (pS006’, pS006*, pS013, pS004, pS004*, pS002*)
Extraction of Genomic DNA
1) Pick a single colony into 50 ul of H20.
Fresh colonies (grown that day) work best, but they can also come from 4 C.
Pipet 2ul onto plates to have C1-C8
Pipet 2 ul into 5ml Media with antibiotics to make liquid cultures
2) Boil for 5 minutes.
1.5 ul of this can be used directly for PCR.
Best if used directly, but can also be stored at 4 C for a few days.
PCR Reaction
Keep all the reagents at 4 °C while preparing the mixture.
Pre-heat the thermocycler to 95 °C and transfer your reaction directly from 4 °C.

Restreak plates
Some of the plates were too full grown -> Rstreak for single colonies
