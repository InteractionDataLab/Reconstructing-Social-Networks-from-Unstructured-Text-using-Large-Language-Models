Friday 20th September
• The cloning for biobricking TDMH worked, so we have to check if it has the insert. We run a PCR with the TDMH primers and we get a bend of around 700 bp, which is fine. We also did a PCR with the biobrick verification primers and the bend was around 1 kb and it was different then the band for the pSB1C3 (bigger, but the difference is not that obvious). So there is probably something inside.
• We did a new setup where we also tried to use M. smegmatis which is not GFP and stain it with a fluorescent die for Mycobacteria, but its not working. After a few h the level of contamination was hughe so we are repeating everything tomorrow with adding antibiotics in the media.
