Stress Experiment (sSP001, sSP002, sSP010, sSP011, M13, MMC), Microscope, Gradient PCR of SPCR2, Digestion of SPCR 5 and SPCR7 and Purification of Digestion.
Stress Experiment (sSP001, sSP002, sSP010, sSP011, M13, MMC)
Dilute ON culture 1:100
Centrifuge (1 min, 10rpm)
Wash 1x with 70% of Volume M9 Glucose
Centrifuge again
Take up in 70% of the VOlume M9 Gluo
100ul in each 96 well plate (see pipetting file)
Add MMC 10ug/ml in corresponding wells and incubate in the plate reader
After 90 min add phages into correscponding wells
put back on the plate reader
Microscope
look at the shape and fluorescence at t=0 of sSP001
look at the shape and fluorescence at=90 mi of sSP001 + 10ug/ml MMC
take photos

Purification of Digestion
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 30 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
