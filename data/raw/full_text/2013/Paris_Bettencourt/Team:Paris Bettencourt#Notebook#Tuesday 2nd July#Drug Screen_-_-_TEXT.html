Plasmid Extraction
Plasmids pD004 (pCDF.ew12 zmFNR Spectinomycin), pD005 (pACYC.ew13 soFD, zmSIR Chloramphenicol), pD006 (pACYC.ew17 zmSIR Chloramphenicol) were extracted from NEBTurbo cells using a Thermo Scientific GeneJet Plasmid mini prep kit as described in the protocol (available on google drive).
Lacking Resuspention solution we used some from a different mini prep upstairs.
Plasmids were eluted in 100ul of nanopure water and frozen at -20ºC. Plasmids were included in catalog.
