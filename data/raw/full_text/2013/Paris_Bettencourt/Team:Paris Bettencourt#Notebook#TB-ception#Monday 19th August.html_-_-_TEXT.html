LLO plasmid containing bacteria are growing only on chloramphenicol containing plates, so tetracyclin resistance was lost due to the cloning of the hly downstream of the tet promoter.
The cells we transformed with pET21b (ampiciline resistance) and with the pSB1C3 plasmid (chloramphenicol resistance) are not growing on amp and chl containing plates because the origins of the plasmids are not compatible. So we are repeating the transformation with the pSB3C5 plasmid, which has a different origin.
We have started a co-culture with M. smegmatis and E. coli NEB turbo + pSB1C3 to see if our selective media with nalidixic acid is really working. Two cultures in their stationary phase were mixed (O.D. for M. smegmatis was 1.5 and for E. coli was 1): in 10 mL of LB 100 µL of each culture was added. We did dilution series for the start cultures and for the co-culture. Each was plated on: LBA plates where both strains should grow; on LBA + 3 µg/mL nalidixic acid plates, where only M. smegmatis should grow; on chl plates where only E. coli should grow.
