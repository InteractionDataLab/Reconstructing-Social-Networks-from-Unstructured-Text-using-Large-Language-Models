Transformation efficiency measurements
Transformation of Puc18 to sD001 (BL21 ED3) competent cells. We have made a transformation of pUC18 into our sD001 BL21(DE3) strain  of competent cells.
Transformation was done by heat shock protocol 1 with the following specifications:
200 ul Chemically Competent Cells were thawed on Ice. 0.5 ul DNA was added and incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
HEAT SHOCK cells were Incubated at 42C for 45 seconds then incubated on ice for 2 minutes. 200 ul of LB broth was added and cells were incubated at 37C for 1 hour.
10 ul of cells were plated on agar supplemented with Ampicillin. During the night 18 colonies grew.
