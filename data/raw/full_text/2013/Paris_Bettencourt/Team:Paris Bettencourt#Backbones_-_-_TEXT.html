We upgraded the standard biobrick shipping vector pSB1C3 with a new set of 4 ori’s and antibiotic resistance cassettes so that they can easily be co-expressed.  The system of 4 backbones all have compatible origins and resistance cassettes that allows for
up to 4 back bones to be expressed in a single host bacteria. Additionally, we retained compatibility with Duet expression vectors which we commonly used in our project.
pSB9S1
Contains the mRFP cassette (J04450) and additionally terminators and flanking region from pSB1C3.  The origin of replication has been replaced with CloDF13 replicon with a copy number of 20 – 40 per cell.  The cat gene has been replaced with aadA conveying spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance.
pSB10K1
contains mRFP cassette (J04450) and additionally terminators and flanking region from pSB1C3.  The origin of replication has been replaced with ColA replicon with a copy number of 20 – 40 per cell.  The cat gene has been replaced with kan cassette conveying kanamycin resistance.
pSB3C7
contains mRFP cassette (J04450) and additionally terminators and flanking region from pSB1C3.  The origin of replication has been replaced with P15A replicon with a copy number of 10-12 per cell.  The cat gene has been maintained conveying chloramphenicol resistance.
pSB6A3
contains mRFP cassette (J04450) and additionally terminators and flanking region from pSB1C3.  The origin of replication has been replaced with ColE1 replicon derived from pBR322 with a copy number of approximately 40 per cell.  The cat gene has been replaced with ampR cassette conveying ampicillin resistance.
