In Silico Cloning
We used geneious to perform in silico cloning on our constructed gene sequences to ensure that they were properly made.  SirA and pACYCDuet-1 were both cut with NcoI and AvrII and then the large fragments were extracted and ligated together to form vector pD001.  FdxA and pETDuet-1 were both cut with NcoI and HindIII and the large fragments were extracted and ligated together to form vector pD002.  FprA and pD002 were both cut with NdeI and AvrII and the large fragments were extracted and ligated together to form vector pD003.  Please see Geneious files on Google Drive (or send request for files) for exact sequences.
