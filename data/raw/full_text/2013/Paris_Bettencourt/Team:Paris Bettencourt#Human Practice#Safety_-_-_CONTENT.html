  </B></P><H2> Safety and health of team members or others working in the lab </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P><B>Silencing antibiotic resistance:</B>
      This system includes a phage designed to spread in an <I>E. coli</I> population. If it was
      ingested by someone the phage could spread into the population of <I>E. coli</I> located in the gut. The 
      modifications to our phage, for example GFP expression, are likely to reduce fitness and would 
      facilitate diagnosis. We believe this risk to be comparable to that of other research on commonly 
      used coliphage.</P><P><B>Detecting antibiotic resistance:</B>
      As above, this system uses a coliphage that could in principle spread in human gut fauna. This 
      system also uses CRISPR elements, which are relatively new to science and may present unknown 
      risks. We do not believe that our modifications will increase the risks above that of other 
      research on commonly used coliphage.</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P><B>Eliminating Mycobacteria:</B>
      This project employs the Listeriolysin gene LLO derived from <I>Listeria monocytogenes</I>. This gene 
      contributes the virulence of this pathogen. Although this gene is widely used in Biosafety Level 1 
      facilities, the precautionary principle applies. We will assume that this gene could enhance the 
      pathogenicity of <I>E. coli</I> or other bacteria, for example by allowing them to evade phagocytosis in 
      the human immune system.</P><P><B>Screening for sulfur metabolism inhibitors:</B>
      For this project we will express in <I>E. coli</I> three genes from the sulfur assimilation
      pathway of <I>Mycobacterium smegmatis</I>. We selected genes from this organism
      because it is a non-pathogenic model for <I>M. tuberculosis</I>. To our knowledge, sulfur
      metabolism does not enhance the pathogenicity of any known bacterial species.
      Therefore we believe this project to carry risks not exceeding those of standard lab
      work with <I>E. coli</I>.</P></DIV><H2> Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P><B>Silencing antibiotic resistance:</B>

      The M13 bacteriophage that we use in this project may be capable of spreading in
      human gut flora. We do not believe that the risks exceed that of standard coliphage
      research.</P><P><B>Eliminating Mycobacteria:</B><I>Listeria monocytogenes</I> is a human pathogen, and the LLO gene that we employ
      contributes to that pathogenicity. Although the LLO gene is only one of many genes required for 
      Listeria pathogenicity, we must assume there is some chance it could enhance the pathogenicity of 
      other strains. Release of this strain could, in principle, enhance the pathogenicity of natural 
      human pathogens, particularly that of <I>E. coli</I> and it's relatives.
    </P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P><B>Detecting antibiotic resistance:</B>
      As above, this project carries the risks inherrent to basic M13 phage work.</P><P><B>Screening for sulfur metabolism inhibitors:</B>
      We intend to replate WT <I>E. coli</I> sulfur metabolism, e.g. CysI, with alternative genes
      from <I>M. smegmatis</I> such as SirA. The SirA gene is well characterized and unlikely to relate to 
      pathogenicity. Because both these organisms belong to Risk Group 1, we
      believe there is little risk to the public.
    </P></DIV><H2> Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>In principle, a released coliphage could disrupt natural bacterial ecosystems, for
      example in waste water. We do not believe that our projects employing the M13 bacteriophage pose any 
      risks to the environment beyond those of common bacteriophage research.

      The LLO gene, as a pathogenicity-related factor, poses no specific environmental risks that we are 
      aware of.</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P>
      Alterations of <I>E. coli</I> sulfur metabolism, if released, could potentially disrupt the sulfur cycle 
      in natural bacterial ecosystems. For this to occur, our bacteria would not only need to escape 
      routine laboratory containment practices, but also become
      established in a natural niche. We consider it highly unlikely that our modified
      bacterial strains could compete with natural strains in their native environments.
    </P></DIV><H2> Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>The M13 phage vectors that we use could, in principle, spread in human gut flora.
      Therefore the M13 phage could be maliciously used to spread pathogenic or otherwise harmful genes. 
      We do not see any risks in this category specific to our use of this vector beyond the risks of 
      standard bacteriophage research.

      The LLO gene contributes to Listeria pathogenicity. If used in combination with multiple other 
      pathogenicity elements, 
    </P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P>
      this construct could in principle be used to maliciously enhance bacterial 
      pathogenicity. To our knowledge, Listeria pathogenicity is not yet sufficiently understood that it 
      could be intentionally reproduced in other species. Nevertheless, we take the biosafety concerns of 
      this construct very seriously and we discuss them further in the text below.

      Sulfur metabolism is unrelated to pathogenicity, and we do not think of it
      could be maliciously misused in any way.
    </P></DIV><H2> Risks that might arise if the project would be used as a commercial/industrial product </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P><B>Silencing antibiotic resistance:</B>
      This phage-based system is designed to be used outside the clinic. Our concept is that it 
      would spread in a natural Mycobacterial population and counter select antibiotic-resistant 
      genotypes. Applications of this type are unprecedented, and as far as we know there is no 
      regulatory framework for safely engineering global pathogen populations with a free-circulating phage. Therefore, this
      project must remain in the proof-of-concept phase and can not be scaled up until such a regulatory 
      framework exists. We want to contribute to the development of this framework, but it is beyond the 
      scope of one iGEM project.</P><P><B>Detecting antibiotic resistance:</B>
      This project is designed for use only in the clinic, and could therefore benefit from the
      full measures of clinical containment. Because we believe that the phage that we produce will also 
      be harmless, we are confident that our phage sensor could be scaled up without risk.</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P><B>Eliminating Mycobacteria:</B>
      As above, this system is designed to be used outside the clinic. Further, it is imaging to be a 
      medicine inside the human body. Therefore, in addition to the complexities discussed above, this 
      project must be proven safe for use in human subjects. We don't think that this will be easy, but we do think that the potential public health benefits of this project could some day justify the difficulty.
    </P><P><B>Screening for sulfur metabolism inhibitors:</B>
      For this project, all the synthetic biology will be done in the lab. We intend to produce a 
      small-molecule therapeutic identified by our drug screen. Small molecule drugs require extensive 
      testing before being approved for human use, but the regulatory
      framework for their approval is well-established.
    </P></DIV><H2> Safety training </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>At the beginning of the competition all of the team members received safety training
      for working in the Biosafety Level 1 laboratory. The team members that are working with parts 
      derived from Risk Group 2 organisms received safety training for working in the Biosafety Level 2 
      laboratory. Only those team members were allowed to use the BSL 2 laboratory. Moreover, the 
      Biosafety officer of our laboratory followed our work and students working in the BSL 2 laboratory 
      were supervised by the responsible staff members.</P><P>The safety training was conducted by the Biosafety officer for INSERM U1001 and it included best 
      laboratory practices as described in the WHO laboratory biosafety manual.</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P>Rules about lab protocol, protective clothing and equipment,
      decontamination methods and practices, prevention of the transfer of genetic material and 
      microorganisms, handling of chemicals, machines and emergency procedures.</P><P>In addition to the BSL 1 safety training, team members working with Risk Group 2 parts received BSL 
      2 safety training. It was conducted by the INSERM U1001 group personnel responsible for BSL 2 
      laboratory and it included additional safety precautions and procedures specific for the BSL 2: 
      Protective clothing and equipment, decontamination practices, prevention of the transfer of genetic 
      material and microorganisms, emergency procedures, use and handling of machines, etc.
      Also, they were explained the design feautures unique to a BSL 2 lab.
    </P></DIV><H2>Institutional Biosafety Committee and changes made to the project based on their review </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>The work was carried out in the laboratory of Evolutionary Systems Biology at the 
      Molecular, Evolutive and Medical Genetics Unit (U1001, also known as TaMaRa's lab) of the French 
      National Institute of Medical Research (INSERM) within the Paris Descartes University's Medical 
      faculty. More importantly, the biosafety officer of our unit supervised our work.</P><P>Both institutions have ethical committees though no specific issue concerning our project was 
      raised. Nonetheless, a thorough work was done throughout this period regarding general safety and 
      ethical issues following the process we established in 2009 iGEM team, winner of the Human Practice 
      Award [Ethics and Biosafety] and </P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P>2012 iGEM team, winner of the Safety Commendation and Best 
      Environment Project [bWARE: How safe is safe enough?].</P><P>During the selection of our project, many ideas were considered, and some raised safety 
      issues. Especially while thinking about the tuberculosis, we knew there were serious risks to be 
      considered because of its pathogenic nature. After conversations with several senior researchers in 
      our lab, reading the iGEM safety guidelines and following experience from previous iGEM teams we 
      decided not to use genes from <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> but rather non-Â­infectious host organism 
      like <I>M. smegmatis</I> to serve as a 
      proof-of-principle. </P></DIV><H2>The BioSafety Level rating of our lab according to the WHO Biosafety Manual</H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>The BioSafety Level rating of the lab all the team members have access to is BSL 1. To 
      access the BSL 2 lab, team members who needed access got a special BSL 2 safety 
      training. BSL 2 work was carried out only under the supervision of a senior lab manager. 
    </P></DIV><H2> The Risk Group of our parts and chassis organisms</H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>All the parts and organisms we are using are Risk Group 1 except the Listeriolysin O 
      gene that comes from a Risk Group 2 parent organism. All the parts and organisms do 
      match the BSL rating of our laboratories. 
    </P></DIV><H2> Risk Group 2 part - Listeriolysin O </H2><DIV class="leftparagraph"><P>Hly gene is encoding Listeriolysin O (LLO) lacking its secretion signal sequence. LLO is a hemolysin derived from <I>L. monocytogenes</I> which enables phagosomal membrane lysis. We use hly carrying <I>E. coli</I> to deliver TDMH protein to the cytosol of the macrophages. According to our literature search, there isn't any better part that could fulfill this purpose. <I>E. coli</I> BL21 (DE3) expressing listeriolysin may be able to invade any eucaryotic cell, although literature data suggest that it requires other proteins like invasin or internalin.</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><P>We don't believe that hly gene isn't dangerous - hly carring strain should be able to invade any eucaryotic cell performing phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria. As mentioned above, special safety measures have been taken in account while working with bacteria transformed with this part.
