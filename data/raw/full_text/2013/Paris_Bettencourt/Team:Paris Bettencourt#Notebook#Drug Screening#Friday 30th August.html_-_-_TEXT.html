From 2013.igem.org
Confirmation of P1 phage transduction:
Colony PCR was used on patched colonies from the p1 phage transduction. The primers used for each colony were CysI F/R and KanR F/R.
PCR confirmed that CysI was deleted in BL21(AI) and replaced with a Kanomycin resistance gene.
2 Single colonies from each agar plate of the patched p1 phage transduced plates were picked and used to inoculate 5ml LB broth overnight.  750ml of overnight culture was added to 250ml of 60% glycerol in a cryotube.
