Conjugation, Miniprep addgene plasmids,Glycerol Stock of addgene plasmids
Conjugation
sSP001, SP002, keio Delta PyrF
F+ comes from XL1 Blue (glycerol stock Trojan Horse) => F+ is tetR
Protocol :
1)   From O/N cultures Dilute strains 1/100 in LB
2)   Wait for OD to reach O,2
3)   Prepare 4 tubes (in BD tubes) :
-       Tube 1 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 1 (sSP001) ,5 mL LB = control
-       Tube 2 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 2 (sP001) + 0,5 mL LB = control
-       Tube 3 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 3 (keio Delta pyrF) + 0,5 mL LB = control
-       Tube 4 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 4 (XL1) + 0,5 mL LB = control
-       Tube 5 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 1 (sSP001) + 0,5 mL LB with Strain 4 (XL1)
-       Tube 6 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 2 (sSP002) + 0,5 mL LB with Strain 4 (XL1)
-       Tube 7 = 0,5 mL LB with Strain 3 (keio Delta pyrF) + 0,5 mL LB with Strain 4 (XL1)
4)   Incubate 2 hours at 37°C (actually not in the shaker, but we accidently kept them in the shaker...)
5)   Plate 10ul for controls, 100uL, 10ul  for mixed tubes on LB antibiotics (Tube 5: Chl + Tet, Tube 6: Chl + Tet, Tube 7: Kan + Tet)
6)   Incubate overnight at 37°C
Miniprep addgene plasmids
1) Pellet  4 ml of liquid culture (4000 rpm, 10 min)
2) Discard supernatant
3) resuspend the cells in 250 µL of resuspension solution
4) add 250 µL of lysis solution, mix by inverting 4-6 times
5) add 350 µL of neutralization solution
4) centrifuge for 5 min
5) transfer supernatant to spin column
6) centrifuge for 1 min
7) discard flow through
8) add 500 µL wash solution and centrifuge for 1 min , discard flow through(repeat this step)
9) centrifuge for 1 min to remove leftover liquid
10) transfer the column on a 1.5 ml tube
11) add 50 µL of elution buffer and incubate for 2 min
12) centrifuge for 2 min
13) Nanodrop the concentration and freeze at -20°
