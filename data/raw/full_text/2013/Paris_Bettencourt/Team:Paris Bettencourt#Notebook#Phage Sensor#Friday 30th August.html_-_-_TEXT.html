Friday 30th August
M13 test, DpnI digest (SPCR5,6,7), Gel SPCR5,6,7 and PCR purification of DpnI digested SPCR5, SPCR6, SPCR7
M13 test
dilute ON cultures (NEB turbo, FR-433) 1: 100, grow up to an OD of ~0.6
1) 100 μ l of plating bacteria per tube (OD 0.6)
2) Prepare tenfold serial dilutions (10-6  to 10-9 ) of the bacteriophage stock in LB
3) Put 10 μ l/ 100 μ l of each dilution to the bacteria
4)  Mix the bacteriophage particles with the bacterial culture by vortexing gently.
5) Add 40 μ l of X-gal solution (working conc) and IPTG (working conc) solution to each of the tubes
6) Add 3ml of Agar to each tube and gently vortexing for 3 seconds
7) Pour the mixture onto  plates containing LB medium supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 and 2x IPTG and Xgal
8) Swirl the plate gently to ensure an even distribution of bacteria and agar.
9) Incubate them at 37°C.
DpnI digest (SPCR5,6,7)
add 8ul DpnI per tube and digest for 1h at 37°, shaking
Gel SPCR5,6,7
1%, 100V, 20min
PCR purification of DpnI digested SPCR5, SPCR6, SPCR7
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 30 μl Buffer EB  to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
