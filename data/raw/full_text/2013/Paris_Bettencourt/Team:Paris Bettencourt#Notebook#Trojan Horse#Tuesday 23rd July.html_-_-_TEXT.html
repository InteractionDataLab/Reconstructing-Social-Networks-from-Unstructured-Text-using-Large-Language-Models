23th July
Infectiveness characterization experiments
The night before: prepare O/N of F+ cells, prepare O/N of phagemid producing cells (in this case : sT007 )
Centrifugate phagemid producing cells
Filter the supernatant 0.45um, stock it at 4°C (it contains the phages)
Dilute 200x MGZ1, F+  from O/N
Wait until OD600 = 0.7
Immediately mix MGZ1 and the supernatant in different proportions
Here we tried 1/1 (vol supernatant/vol cells), 1/10 and 1/100
Immediately dilute each of them to 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6
Plate 100uL of those dilutions on LB-agar, AMP, KAN, AMP+KAN
Incubate O/N
Count colonies
Interpretation: Colonies on AMP: infected by litmus28i
Colonies on KAN: infected by M13K07
Colonies on AMP+KAN: coinfected by litmus28i and M13K07 phagemid producing cells
Results
Conclusions:
Cells that were mixed with 1/1 supernatant didn't survive the excess of antibiotics that were present in the supernatant.
Even at low ratio like 1/100 the infection rate of litmus28i-GFP is about 100%. GFP detection confirmed this result: almost 100% of cells were fluorescent.
Co-infection did occur. It would be interesting to test if those colonies are indeed producing phages.
Start O/N culture of M13K07 Start O/N culture of MGZ1,F+
