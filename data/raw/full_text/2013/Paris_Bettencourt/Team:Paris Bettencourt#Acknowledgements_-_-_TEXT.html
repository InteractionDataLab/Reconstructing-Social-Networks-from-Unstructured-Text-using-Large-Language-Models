Thanks!
The participation of our team at the 2013 competition was made possible through the extremely generous support of the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation, which supports the team since its first appearance in the competition in 2007.

Host Laboratory
Our iGEM team is kindly hosted in the CRI (Inderdisciplinary Research Center) located in the Faculté de médecine Paris Descartes at the center of Paris. In the heart of one of Paris' biggest hospitals, the CRI  hosts interdisciplinary undergraduate (LFdV) , Master (AIV) ; devoted also to systems and synthetic biology!) as well as a PhD program (FdV) . This center is directed by François Taddei and Ariel Lindner. We also want especially like to thank Jake, Zoran, Stanislas, Mathias and Luis, who made themselves available at any time, and guided us through this project.
For the Laboratory's facilities, we are kindly hosted by the CRI/INSERM U1001 lab, that lent us benches, microscopes and others facilities. We thank all the members of the INSERM U1001 for their kind help and that they shared not only their equipment but also their experience with us. We want to name Sebastien Fleurier and Marie-Florence Bredèche for their support. We would like to give a special thank Chantal Lotton, the lab manager, for her advices on the bench, her warm words, her organization skills, her introductions, for being there for us any time and that she ensured that we worked safely.

Special Thanks
We want to thank Tamara Milosevic and Maria Pothier who survived the summer with us in the lab. We would also like to thank the secretary staff of the CRI, Laura Ciriani, Véronique Waquet, Elodie Kaslikowski and the rest of the staff for their help and advice in the administrative tasks and commercial relations every team has to face. We also want to thank the labs that supported us by making us their parts/strains available. Special thanks go to  Monica Ortiz from the Endy Lab in Stanford, Anil Ojha of the University of Pittsburgh, Daniel A. Portnoy from UC Berkeley, Pamela Silver at the Harvard Medical School, Nicole Guiso, Nicolas Hegerle, Brigitte Gicquel, Catherine Grillot-Courvalin and Patrice Courvalin from the Institute Pasteur and Stephane Canaan UMR 7282 - CNRS. Also, thanks to Lorenzo Guglielmetti for useful discussions on the situation of TB in France and Europe. Thanks to Christopher Dye of World Health Organization (WHO) for his wise advice about tuberculosis. Last but not least, thanks to Christopher Anderson for the discussion about our project and about health and synthetic biology.
Specially, we like to thank Nicola Bertoldi. Nicola did the master with many of us, and coming from a philosophy background he has a great interest in Synthetic Biology. We wanted for him to be in the team, but due to differences in calendar it was not possible. However, during the brief time we got together resulted in the "Technology Transfer" essay.
