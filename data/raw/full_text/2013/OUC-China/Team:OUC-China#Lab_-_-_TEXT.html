Our OUC-iGEM Lab is attached to the Experimental Teaching Center of Marine Life Sciences, Ocean University of China. Our lab was established by Association of Science and Technology (OAST) in September, 2011. Our center has long endeavored to do researches in Marine Microbial Ecology, Marine Aquaculture Diseases, Marine Beneficial Microorganism, and eta. The main purpose of this lab is to support iGEM experiment. Considering that synthetic biology is a new branch of biology, our lab is directly managed by the iGEM members. The experimental apparatus gathers from many other labs of our center. Now our lab is trying to become an "Open platform" for every student who want and enable to do independently designed experiments. Our lab has now established a thorough  management system running by a 6 people committee.
