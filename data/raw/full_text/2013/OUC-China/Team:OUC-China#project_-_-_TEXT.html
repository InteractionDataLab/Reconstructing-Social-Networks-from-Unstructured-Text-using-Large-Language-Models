A Brief Introduction of our project
      In previous studies ， membranous organelles are the unique structure of eukaryotic cells, and in rare bacteria and paleontology . So Magnetospirillum magneticumis considered to be important biological model systems of studying prokaryotic organelles because the structure of magnetosome in Magnetospirillum magneticum has similar traits toeukaryotic organelles with membranes . And our task is to reconstruct themagnetosome membrane in Escherichia coli , in the meantime we offer intracellular membranous structure part that can be used by prokaryotes for synthetic biology .
      Magnetospirillum magneticum requires a Micro-aerobic and Oligotrophic environment in order to produce magnetosome, so the significance of our project lies in simplifying magentosome produce method, making path for futher functional gene research. We use homologous recombination to transfer the mamAB gene into E.Coli to build an intracellular membranous structure part that can be used by prokaryotes for synthetic biology.
      And also , as the mamK gene is critical for the cavity construction , we artificialy improve the mamK gene's expression by stabilize its mRNA with a new method , hoping it can be used to promoting the cavity construction .
Our goals. ：
      Firstly : We are eager to use the cavity as a intracellular microreactor . And we also hope use it in enzymes enrichment .
      Secondly : we want to complete the production of bio-synthetic nanoscale iron .
