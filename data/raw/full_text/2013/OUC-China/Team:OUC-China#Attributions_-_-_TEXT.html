Brainstorming and research
All 13 team members participated in the brainstorming and research, under the guidance of last years’ team members. Team member Wenjun Wang came up with the original idea for the artificial organelle and Yu Wang with the original idea for the RNA guardian.
Lab work
Wet lab work was divided into two parts: artificial organelle construction and RNA device building. The organelle group consists of Wenjun Wang, Xiaodong Zhong, Qianyun Lu, Kaili Qin, Mengqi Sun. The RNA group consists of Yu Wang, Qiu Wang, Xue Sun. There are eight wet lab members in total.
Safety
Subjects on safety were discussed among the team. Safety form was finished by Mengqi Sun. Lab management was carried out by Wenjun Wang, Xiaodong Zhong and Hong Li at the first stage of the project, whom were later replaced by Yu Wang, Xue Sun and Mengqi Sun(QIBEBT).
Modeling
Dry lab member Lei Zhong established the model for the magnetic detection module, and Xu Lin built the model for the RNA guardian.
Wiki Design
Wiki was designed by Yuchen Zheng, assisted by Hong Li. Wiki design was guided by Past team member Yong Peng. We express great gratitude for his generous contribution.
Human Practice
Team OUC-China always observes active performance in the field of human practice. This year, Mengqi Sun was in Charge of human practice, and we could not have completed the immense workload without the help of Xiaodong Zhong, Wenjun Wang, Yu Wang, Qiu Wang, Xue Sun, Hong Li, adviser Li Kang and all the other members and friends that helped out.
Funding
Xue Sun handled all of the team's expenses, while Xiaodong Zhong seeked funding through various means. We thank all the guidance in financial issues given by past team member Li Kang.
Sponsors
We would like to thank Ocean University of China for financial fundings, Lab Center of College of Marine Life Science for our lab, and lab space in QIBEBT.
We are extremely grateful for our Magnetospirillum Magneticum AMB-1 strain provided by Dr. Xiao Tian and the mamC::GFP fusion protein plasmid provided by Prof. Wu Longfei.
We also appreciate donations from past OUC-China members.
In addition, all the organizations and teachers mentioned in the Acknowledgements have sponsored or assisted us in some way, whether in material or in advising.
