Achievement & judge criteria
1.We construct a series of new standard Biobrick part and device and submit it to MIT.
2. We design a “RNA guardian” device and prove it matches our goals and submit it to MIT.
3.We find that Biobrick BBa_K590015 do not work because of the wrong sequence, so we correct it and registry the mamJ gene(BBa_K1059014).
4.We utilize the microfluidic chip to build the mathematical model reflecting the relationship between the bacterial number and magnetic field intensity.
5.We built a model to simulate the route of E.coli in the Microfluidic Chip and quantitatively analyze the magnetic detection ability of the sample bacteria, introducing a magnetism detection coefficient to quantify this ability.
6.We preserved Magnetospirillum Magneticum AMB-1 mamAB genes in E.coli, prevented the genes lose when AMB-1 strain was cultured in high oxygen partial pressure environment.
7.We help Tsinghua University by constructing a device and sharing drugs.
8.We run lots of human practice activities to share knowledge and thinking of synthetic biology, discussing and practicing  in the usage of biotechnology.
We deserve a Gold medal!
