Thinking outside of the box
Augmented reality app
We have created an augmented reality app to allow people to interact with our poster - to be presented at Latin America Jamboree (Chile). In that way they can, using our application, access our videos, charts, graphs, and our wiki page. We think the poster presentations events can be more interesting with this kind of resource and we never saw the use of such technology in academic poster before.
The application was created as a skin of the Aurasma system, in a partnership, and can be downloaded for Android in this website: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurasma.skinned.ctit&hl=en
The video below is a demonstration of this app, note that some images of the poster trigger the content (video, image and a 3D model) in the tablet:
Metalab
The Meta-Lab aims to be an open space for collaboration, creation, experimentation and development of objects and devices to support teaching and research, through low-tech tools, free knowledge and rapid prototyping machines. Our first goal was to create a site to group DIY projects related to science that could be used by universities and schools in Brazil.

DIY Equipament
The fluorimeter is a device capable of measuring the intensity of fluorescence emitted by a particular substance, so
First prototype
we can be be able to know the exact amount of this substance in the sample. The bacteria that is being developed as a diagnostic tool by the UFMG team (CardBio project), will be able to report, according to the fluorescence intensity, the amount of certain substances (biomarkers) in serum of the patient, allowing a more accurate assessment of their health conditions. Despite its simplicity, the fluorometers are expensive equipaments and not so easy to use, so, there is a necessity to develop simple and cheaper model.
Based on previous iGEM projects[1] we design and build a portable and low cost fluorometer, that could be used with the Cardbio bacteria. The first version is based in the project of the Cambridge Team 2010 (Eglomer), but we use a cheaper light sensor: the TSL235, it´s a light-to-frequency converter that outputs a square wave (50% duty cycle) with frequency directly proportional to light intensity (irradiance). As you can see in the video below, which uses an open hardware oscilloscope to test the sensor:
In the second version, we inserted a color sensor in the previous project (ADJD-S311, able to discriminate different light frequencies), we remove the keypad and use a larger screen for easier reading. More testing needs to be done to make the device suitable for the needs of the project.

HackSpace BH
There are also plans to create a HackSpace at our city. The idea is still brand new, but very promising, as seen on the designs below:

MetaLab- a space for collaborative innovation in Belo Horizonte
Art work
Well, there is no doubt about how science and art get well together. Besides, after the days of hard work in the lab or outside of it, turning the human practices ideas true, nothing better than some music to relax. Even better if it becomes part of the work, telling the history of an iGEM team, making our days more happy and taking all team members even closer for the chorus... That is why the video below "came to life": especially to let you feel a little bit how was being part of iGEM_UFMG team. Hope you enjoy and may sing with us! ;)
The E. coli our dilemma
The E. coli our dilemma
Red and blue and green and yellow
The E. coli from IGEM goes shining
And when it grows (yes, it grows!) and shine
When we see it is like a samba that
Seems so cool and and it is so useful
That when it grows (yes, it grows!) and shine
Oh! But I watch it so sadly
What can I do so it works well?
Yes, we would make many happy hearts!
But each day when I walk through the lab
It looks great but not enough for me
Red and blue and green and yellow
The E. coli from IGEM goes shining
And when it shines I smile, I'll go to Jamboree
