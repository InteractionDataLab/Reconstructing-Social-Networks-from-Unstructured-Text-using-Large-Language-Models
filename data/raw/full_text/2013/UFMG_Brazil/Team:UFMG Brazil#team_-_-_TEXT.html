The Team
UFMG_Brazil Team
Undergraduates
Alan Sales Barbosa
Bachelor in Science and education student in Biology at UFMG, he has experience with microbiology, immunology, cell biology and vascular physiology. Former vice president of the Junior Company of Biology -  UFMG, is currently an undergraduate researcher in Angiogenesis Laboratory, Department of Physiology and Biophysics from Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB - UFMG). Alan likes natural sciences in general, from the basic research to the applied, including cell therapy, synthetic and system biology as well as science popularization projects. So, on iGEM_UFMG team, he has been engaged mainly with human practices and the eternal seeking for funding and sponsoring, being not able to put hands dirty on the experimental trek as much as he wished.
Carlos Alberto Xavier Gonçalves
Carlos  is  an  undergraduate  Biology  student  at  UFMG,  and  also  has  some  expertise  with Computer  Graphics.  Because  of that, he's been  working both in the lab and behind the screen of his  computer,  aiding  the  team  not  only  with his scientific knowledge and experience, but with his art   skills  as  well.  He  plans  on getting his  degree  this  year,  and  already  aims  to follow  up with  a masters in Bioinformatics.
Júlio Leandro Martins
Júlio  is  a  Computer  Science  student  since  2011  at  Universidade  Federal  de  Minas  Gerais (UFMG/Brazil)  and  scholarship  holder  at  Immunochemistry  Lab.  He  has  a  passion  by biochemistry  and  immunology, specially to study, develop and apply computing methods to cope with problems in these areas. Keep your food away from him or you will never see it again! =P
Lucas Ribeiro
Hello, my name is Lucas, I'm a medical student at UFMG. I'm interested in human health in general and the new possibilities offered by synthetic biology.
Paola Giovana
Is graduated in Media at Centro Universitário UNA. Currently, Paola is an undergrad student in Product Design at UFMG. She is the one who made our beautiful logo and our brochure!
Raphael Jorge
Raphael is an undergraduate Biomedicine student at UFMG. Worked as undergraduate researcher in the lab of immunochemistry of protein being directed by Professor Liza Felicori. Turned to the field of synthetic biology, it was love at first sight. His desire is to follow this research field and, perhaps, become a teacher one day.
Graduates
Fernando Carvalho da Silva Coelho
Fernando is a Bachelor in Computer Science and Master's degree Computer Science student at UFMG. An old fashioned programmer who uses a black and green terminal with Vim as his favorite text editor. He is passionate for Open Source software and the modern Web. His main skill is in Pythonic magic, for solving problems as quickly as possible.
Ítalo Faria do Valle
Ítalo is a Bachelor in Biological Sciences and is a masters degree student in Bioinformatics at UFMG. He is a big lover of molecular biology and a enthusiastic in using computational tools to understand biological phenomena. His main studies are about genomics and evolution of Trypanosoma cruzi, but the IGEM has awakened in him a big interest in synthetic biology and he is already thinking in follow his scientific career with this topic!
Marianna Kunrath Lima
Marianna  is  a  master’s ­degree student in Biochemistry and Immunology at UFMG and her thesis is  about  DNA  repair  in Trypanosoma  cruzi.  She  has  great  experience  with  molecular  biology, which  made  her  being  a  lab  hero,  sometimes  literally  chasing  reagents  and  equipments  to  be used  in  CardBio’s  experiments.  Sometimes  she  is  too  down  to  earth,  but the  team  remembers her that dreaming a little bit is good!
Clara Guerra Duarte
Clara is a postdoctoral fellow in the Immunochemistry laboratory at UFMG. She received her PhD in Biochemistry and Immunology from the UFMG in August of 2011. She has been the major adviser for UFMG's iGEM team this season. She's been primaraly involved in the project concept development and keeping the team motivated! :)
Instructors
Liza Felicori
Dr. Liza Felicori is full professor in the Biochemistry and Immunology Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Her work is focused on protein-protein interactions application to diagnosis and therapeutics. Since 2008, she is working on the field of systems biology and synthetic biology. She is very enthusiastic with synthetic biology and very motivated to bring to light this field in the University through iGEM.
Santuza Teixeira
Is graduated in Biology by Universidade de Brasília (1982), has masters in Molecular Biology by Universidade de Brasília (1985) and PhD in Biochemistry by Universite de Lausanne, on Switzerland (1990). She did a post-doc internship at the University of Iowa (1991-1996). She is currently a titular professor at Department of Biochemistry and Immunology of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and a member of INCTV. She was a researcher at Howard Hughes Medical Institute (International Research Scholar). Has experience in research on Molecular Biology, working mainly with the subjects: Molecular Parasitology and Parasites Genomics, with emphasis on studies about genetic expression regulation, antigen discoveries, genetic variability and DNA repair on ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

To all our friends and family, who contributed to our “Vakinha” (a Brazilian way to raise funds with family and friends).
Collaborations
Jamboré
Our team participated in the first event that promoted the meeting of the Brazilian teams, which was hosted by the USP team(University of São Paulo). This historic event (and very funny one) was called Jamboré. All the teams members were able to play the card game created as a human practices by the USP team, know themselves and the projects better, join a discussion about the difficulties of the competition and the solutions that each team has found (with the sponsorship, for example) and collaborate with suggestions.
Purdue´s standard protocol
We collaborated with the survey done by the Purdue´s team about the development of a standard protocol. They are developing a list of protocols and assays that need to be completed in order to submit the part to the registry. For us it seems like a great idea and we hope that our collaboration has helped this project.
