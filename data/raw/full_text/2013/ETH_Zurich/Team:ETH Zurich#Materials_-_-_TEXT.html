PCR (for gene amplification or colony PCR)
PCR was used for gene amplification for cloning and for colony PCR for the clone selection. For colony PCR Taq polymerase was used whereas for the gene amplification due to higher needs in accuracy Phusion® polymerase was used. For gene Amplification PCR the reaction volume is 50μL and for colony PCR 20μL. 1-20ng of the template plasmids were used for the amplification. For the coplony PCR in some cases NEB® QuickLoad 2X Taq master mix was used.

Experimental procedures
Double layer agar plate experiment
The method of double layer agar experiment was adapted from bacteriphage plaque experiments used for phage transduction.
Pour 1.5% LB-agar (bottom layer) on a petridish. Allow to cool and solidify.
Add 100μl of liquid culture of receiver cells into 3ml of 0.7% agar (40℃).
The receiver cultures were grown to OD600 of 0.4 and then dilute into 2mL of 0.7% Agar
Allow the top layer to cool down and solidify.
1.5ul of the sender cells were then pipetted on to the two layer agar plates.
Incubate the plates at 37℃.
Enzyme kinetics assay
This protocol was provided by Dr. Johannes Haerle
Prepare buffers
Lysis buffer: 10 mg/ml Lysozyme, 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8
Reaction buffer: 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8
NOTE: For other enzymes than the ones we tested (Aes,GusA,NagZ,PhoA) you might need different buffers
Cell culture
Inoculate bacteria in 20 mL of LB with antibiotics
Let grow at 37°C shaking(200 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.6
Induce enzyme expression (100nM AHL in our case)
Let grow at 37°C shaking(200 rpm) for 4-5h
Cell lysis
Transfer to 50 mL Falcon™ tube
Spin down at 4°C for 5 min with 4 rcf
Resuspend in lysis buffer, 1 μL/mg pellet
Transfer to eppendorf tubes
Incubate at room temperature for 10 min at 220 rpm
Spin down at 4°C for 10 min with max. speed
Transfer the supernatant to new tubes, discard pellets
Cell free extract can be stored at -20°C or continue processing
Dilution
The following values were provided by Johannes Haerle
Aes: Dilute CFX 1:100 in reaction buffer
GusA: Dilute CFX 1:100 in reaction buffer
NagZ: Use pure
PhoA: Dilute CFX 1:10 in reaction buffer
Hydrolysis reaction
Perform this measurement in a 96 well plate or similar
Perform 3 replicates for each substrate concentration
Present 41.6 μL reaction buffer in each well
Add 8 μL diluted CFX (the further dilution ocurring here is intended)
Add 30.4 μL of corresponding substrate
Detection of fluorescence in suitable plate reader (λEx 365 nm, λEm 445 nm)
Microtiter plate
The experimental set-up included a 96-well plate filled with 180 μL LB media , 10uμ of receiver cells and 10μL of different OHHL concentrations, everything in triplicates. (+ blank and negative control). The experiment runs for 16 hours in order to monitor the evolution of fluorescence and later choose the steady state to create the sensitivity curve.
Facs experiments
For the real Colisweeper game we need to know about the behavior of the promoters on agar plates.
We set-up an experiment which consists in pooring agar plates containing different OHHL concentration going form 10-5nM to 105nM by 10 fold increase. The wild type and the luxR variant promoter were streaked onto those plates to analyze the sensivity to OHHL of the wild type and the promoter on an agar plate. After 15hours of incubation at 37 degree celsius some colonies were picked and resuspended in Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS) for the single cell analysis , using again the BD LSRFortessa™ Flow Cytometer System.
For liquid culture:
From overnight cultures we inoculate 50 mL Falcon™ tubes containing 5mL LB media, 5 μL OHHL and the antibiotic. We evaluate a range of 10 different concentrations from
10-4nM OHHL to 105nM OHHL by a 10 fold increase, according to the results of the plate reader analysis. The measurements were done in duplicates.
Substrate tests
Liquid cultures
5 ml M9 medium + antibiotics
Add 100 ul of ON culture
Grow until OD(600) 0.4 - 0.6 is reached
Add substrate (see table for applicable end concentrations)
Shake at 37°C for 10 - 20 minutes
Colonies
5 ml M9 medium + antibiotics
Add 100 ul of ON culture
Grow until OD(600) 0.4 - 0.6 is reached
Prepare M9 plates
Pipette 1.5 ul of the liquid culture onto the agar plate for one colony
Incubate at 37°C for at least 11 hours
Add 1.5 ul of substrate onto colonies (see table for applicable concentrations)
Wait until color develops, either at RT or 37°C (usually faster)
Spiral diffusion test with AHL
The receiver cells (J09855+GFP) were plated on LB-agar in a spiral pattern.
After overnight incubation a drop of 5μL AHL was added to the center of the spiral , on the central colony.
The diffusion of the AHL was recorded by the fluorescent activated colonies over time (in Dark Hood)
