Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts : GusA ; GusA with TEV and HIS-Tags ; PhoA ; PhoA with TEV and HIS-Tags ; Aes  ; Aes with TEV and HIS-Tags ; NagZ ; pLuxR1
Silver medal criteria
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected : The hydrolases
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry GusA ; GusA with TEV and HIS-Tags ; PhoA ; Aes  ; Aes with TEV and HIS-Tags ; NagZ  ; pLuxR1
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project : Human practices
Gold medal criteria
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines): phoA-His Tag
