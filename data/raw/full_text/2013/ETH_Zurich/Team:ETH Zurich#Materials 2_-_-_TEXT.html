Thermo scientific NanoDrop™ 2000 spectrophotometer
In order to measure the concentrations of our plasmids after the Miniprep we used the NanoDrop® 2000 spectrophotometer:
Figure 1.NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer
NanoDrop™ 2000
UV-Vis Spectrophotometer
Smart. Simple. Robust.
The NanoDrop 2000 is a microvolume spectrophotometer for measuring DNA, RNA, and protein. Using the patented sample retention system* the NanoDrop 2000 accurately measures samples as small as 0.5 µL, and reports sample concentration, purity ratios, and full spectral data.
Full spectral microvolume UV-Vis analysis:
Fast measurement time of less than 5 seconds – just pipette, measure, and wipe clean
Measure 0.5 - 2 µL DNA, RNA, and protein samples
Software includes pre-configured methods for measuring nucleic acids, Protein A280 and colorimetric assays, and flexible customized methods
Measure concentrations up to 15,000 ng/µl (dsDNA) - eliminating the need for dilutions
Low-cost operation – no plates or other consumables
Perfect for proteins with low wavelength absorbance, such as peptides at 205 nm

Multimode microplate readers for infinite application flexibility and high-level of performance
Figure 6. Tecam Infinite M200 Pro™
The Infinite 200 PRO is a user-friendly and affordable multimode reader, designed to cater for the needs of today’s applications. Based on the highly successful Infinite 200 series of microplate reader, the Infinite 200 PRO can provide a full range of leading detection methods in one easy-to-use modular instrument, with either Quad4 monochromator™ or filter-based technologies. Users can select the desired modules to create the perfect reader for their needs, with the option to upgrade as requirements change. The Infinite 200 PRO offers excellent sensitivity, multiplexing capabilities and high format flexibility, including 6- to 384-well microplates, PCR plates, cuvettes and Tecan’s patented NanoQuant Plate™ for low sample volumes.
For uncompromised performance in all detection modes, the Infinite 200 PRO uses advanced optics and high-performance detectors, optimized for the requirements of fluorescence, luminescence and absorbance reading. The Infinite 200 PRO offers a wide range of detection modes, including:
Fluorescence intensity (top and bottom reading) (UV – NIR & wavelength scanning)
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
Time resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) like HTRF®

i-control™ – Microplate Reader Software
The Infinite® series of Tecan readers (Infinite 200, Infinite F500 and Infinite M1000) comes complete with i-control, the easy-to-use microplate reader software. It allows the user to define the workflow for each application. Each workflow is easily created by dragging and dropping the processing steps into a sequence according to the assay protocol. The application workflow is then visible to the user and can be saved for future use. Data are easily managed and exported to Windows® compatible formats (Excel®).

Amersham Biosciences Novaspec Plus™
All our Optical Density at wavelength 600nm were determined using the Novaspec Plus™
Novaspec Plus™ Visible Spectrophotometer
Figure 6. Novaspec Plus™ Visible Spectrophotometer
Novaspec™ Plus Visible Spectrophotometer is ideal for general biotech laboratory use. There are stored methods for the standard colorimetric methods of Bradford, BCA, Biuret and Lowry in addition to the basic modes of absorbance, transmittance,OD600 and concentration measurements. The use of diode array technology permits rapid wavelength scans to be made as well and, as there are no moving parts, make for a highly reliable and low maintenance product (Fig 1).
The large backlit display enables the graphical results for wavelength scans, kinetics assays (including slope calculation for rate/activity studies) and standard curves to be viewed (Fig 2).Up to 99 methods for such experiments can be stored for instant recall and use by a laboratory assistant. Novaspec Plusis delivered with Graﬁco, a PC utility software package, and the requisite serial lead, providing the user with the means to capture, print and store data from the instrument (with a time/date stamp) onto a PC so that a results log can be built up or data exported to Microsoft™ Excel.
The cell holder supplied with Novaspec Plus accepts standard 10-mm pathlength glass or plastic cells (adapters are availableto convert it to accept 10-, 12- and 16-mm diameter test tubes).It can be removed for cleaning, or ﬂushed through with water in situ, if spillages occur.
For users who require thermostatting, particularly for kineticsstudies and use with test kits, a special version of Novaspec Plus is available with a factory ﬁtted heated cell holder (37 °C only);note that this cell holder cannot be added retrospectively.
