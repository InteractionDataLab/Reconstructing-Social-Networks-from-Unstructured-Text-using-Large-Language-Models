Contributions
The experimental work in the lab, computational modeling and the webpage was done by team members only. Every student had a responsibility for a particular task but of course work in the lab as well as on the wiki. Meret was responsible for the human practice, optimization and cloning, Parvathi for the proof of principle experiments with GFP, Angela for the hydrolase tests, Matthias for the promoter library, Susanna for the Model and Fabian for the WIKI.
We thank our advisors for their continuous support in result interpretation, trouble shooting and debugging of the experiments, model and the WIKI.
