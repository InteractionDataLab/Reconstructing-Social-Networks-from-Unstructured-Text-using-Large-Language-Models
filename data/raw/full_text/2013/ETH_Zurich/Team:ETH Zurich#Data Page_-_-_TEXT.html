Our favorite new parts
Our candidate for best natural biobrick:
1. Main Page - Acetyl esterase (Aes), BBa_K1216002: is a hydrolase that originated from Escherichia Coli which can be used as a reporter enzyme in biology. Different butyrate or caprylate substrates can be used to detect either a fluorescent or colorimetric signal after cleavage, depending on the requirements. We characterized the enzyme by using the blue 5-Bromo-6-Chloro-3-indoxyl butyrate and the fluorescent 4-Methylumbelliferyl-butyrate. Therein we did a Michaelis Menten kinetic of the cell lysate of E.Coli overexpressing  Aes
(Km=31.47 ± 12.51 μM).
2. Main Page - Alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) with His tag and TEV restriction site, BBa_K1216002: is an improved version of the BBa_J61032 PhoA. This hydrolase is originated from Citrobacter which can be used as reporter enzyme in biology. It catalyzes production of free inorganic phosphate and phosphoryl transfer reactions to various alcohols. We proved that the His-tag doesn't affect the protein function. To this end we tested the enzymatic reaction with yellow 4-Nitrophenylphosphate, the blue 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and the fluorescent 4-MU-phosphate which were both converted to the respective colorimetric or fluorescent output. To characterize the PhoA with His tag we did a Michaelis Menten kinetic of the cell lysate of E.Coli overexpressing PhoA-His (Km= 72.0 ± 7.3 μM). In order to physically prove the presence of a His-tag we did an SDS-PAGE gel and a western blot using an anti-His antibody from mouse and an anti mouse antibody carrying a red fluorescent dye to detect the His-Tag.
3. Main Page - PLuxR mutated promoter, BBa_K1216007: is a mutated version of the BBa_R0062 PLuxR wild type promoter. The engineered part is used as a high pass filter in our system. We characterized the promoter by establishing an AHL dose response curve in liquid culture as well as in agar plates. We could fit an EC50 of 6.462 nM in liquid culture and 12'555 nM in agar plates. For comparison the BBa_R0062 PLuxR wild type has an EC50 of 0.02 nM in liquid culture and 4.45 nM in agar plates (EC50 is the half maximal effective concentration). This correspond to a 300'000 fold shift of sensitivity in liquid culture and 2800 fold shift of sensitivity in agar plates. We did the characterization on microtiter plates and in single cell analysis. We also modelled the expression of different reporters under the control of the wild type and the  PLuxR variant (G1).
Used and characterized pre-existing parts:
1. Experience - PLuxR wild type, BBa_R0062: Antiquity (2003-01-31): the promoter has an EC50 of 0.02 nM in liquid culture and 4.45 nM on agar plates (EC50 is the half maximal effective concentration). This is a 220 fold shift in sensitivity between liquid culture and agar plates. We did the characterization on microtiter plates and in single cell analysis (FACS).
2. Experience - Alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), BBa_J61032: Arkin Lab (2006-11-10): is a hydrolase originated from Citrobacter which can be used as a reporter in biology. It catalyzes production of free inorganic phosphate and phosphoryl transfer reactions to various alcohols. We characterized the enzyme by using the yellow 4-Nitrophenylphosphate, the blue 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and the fluorescent 4-MU-phosphate. Therefore we did a Michaelis Menten kinetic of the cell lysate of E.Coli overexpressing PhoA (Km=105.89 ± 5.46 μM).
3. Experience - β-Glucuronidase (GusA), BBa_K330002: iGEM10_HKUST   (2010-10-10): is a hydrolase originated from Bacillus subtilis which can be used as a reporter enzyme in biology. We characterized the enzyme by using the salmon 6-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide-cycloheylammonium salt and the fluorescent 4-MU-β-D-Glucuronide. Therefore we did a Michaelis Menten kinetic of the cell lysate E.Coli overexpressing GusA (Km=141.11 ± 5.27 μM).
4. Experience - PLuxL, BBa_R0063: Antiquity (2003-01-31): the PLuxL promoter is repressed by the LuxR/AHL complex at high AHL concentrations. We use this promoter for the optimization of our circuit. We use it to drive expression of LacI which represses the expression of LuxR in the uninduced state. At high AHL concentration LacI expression is reduced and LuxR is expressed constitutively from PLac.
5. Experience - PLac LuxR PLuxR, BBa_J09855: iGEM2005   (2006-10-26): we used this construct in various experiments. For example for all the promoter library we mutated the BBa_R0062 promoter in the BBa_J09855 construct. We used this construct in our receiver cells, beeing very modulable for reporters, we could clon GFP, RFP and the hydrolases in front of this construct to express the reporter by AHL dependent activation.

For comparison the BBa_R0062 PLuxR wild type has an EC50 of 4.45 nM, on agar plates (EC50 is the half maximal effective concentration). We also modelled the expression of different reporters under the control of the wild type and the promoter library.
2. Main Page - β-Glucuronidase (GusA) with HIS-Tag and TEV restriction site, BBa_K1216004: is a hydrolase originated from Bacillus subtilis which can be used as a reporter enzyme in synthetic biology. Different D-glucuronic acids substrate can be used to detect either a fluorescent or colorimetric signal after cleavage, depending on your requirements. We characterized the enzyme by using the salmon 6-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide-cycloheylammonium salt and the fluorescent 4-MU-β-D-Glucuronide.
