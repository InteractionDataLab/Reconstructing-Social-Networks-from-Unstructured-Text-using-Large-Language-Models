We achieved
Pre-Processing:
- to characterize the AHL diffusion on agar plates and define, with predictions from the model and the experimental results , the distance between colonies, the strengh of the  promoter controlling LuxI production and the incubation time needed to establish a proper AHL gradient.
- to establish several AHL gradients from different mines on one plate, intersections of gradients result in higher AHL levels for the detection of 1, 2 or 3 mines.
- to make a 2D spatio-temporal model for AHL, that encompasses local reactions and diffusion.
Processing:
- to create a mutant first mutant PLuxR variant form PLuxR wild-type promoter by site directed mutagenisis and a 2nd library by rational design  with different EC50.
- to measure the dose-response of those promoters by mutant single cell analysis and determined the EC50 going from 0.02 nM to 6482 nM in liquid culture (for the wild-type and G1) and from 4.45 nM to 12'555 nM on agar plates (for the whole library).
- to find a analytical solution for the EC50 of the promoter we need and therby choose the right candidate from the libary.

Optimization:
- the identification of the leakiness source .
- to model different solutions to reduce the leakiness, such as destabilization of proteins and double negative regulation.
- to optimize the circuit to reduce the leakiness by introduction of a positive feedback loop.
Output:
- to implement several reporters (hydrolases and fluorescent proteins) in one construct.
- to show different colorimetric responses (yellow, salmon, magenta, violett, green and blue) for five hydrolases.
- to show the orthogonality between hydrolase.
- to show a color overlay .
- to characterize the hydrolases with Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
Information processing:
- to establish a spatio-temporal model of the final game .
Human practice:
- analyze the relationship between synthetic biology and games.
- remote controled roboter playing of the game.
- set-up an educational kit containing all parts needed to build  Colisweeper.
