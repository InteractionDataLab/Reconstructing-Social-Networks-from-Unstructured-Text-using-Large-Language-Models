Supervisors
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and the director of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating fate and function of the plethora of  RNA molecules in the cell. Another goal is to develop novel antibiotics targeting RNA molecules.
Anthony Forster
Anthony Forster is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). He is researching synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery, and is currently working towards the synthesis of a minimal cell.
Instructors
Mikael Nissbeck
PhD student at Uppsala RNA Research Center (URRC), Department of Cell and Molecular biology, at Uppsala University since 2012 and is currently working on the human enzyme Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) in the Anders Virtanen group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Abhishek Srivastava
Postdoc at Chemical Biology Group, Department of Cell  and Molecular biology, at Uppsala University since 2012 and is  currently working on ribonuclease P in Leif Kirsebom group at the   Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Stefan Roos
Stefan Roos is an associate professor at the Department of Microbiology at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. Stefan works with genomics, physiology and ecology of probiotic lactobacilli. The primary goals are to understand how those bacteria interact with their host and to design probiotic products with improved activity.
Sethu Madhava Rao Gunja
Research Assistant at Chemical Biology group, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology in Uppsala University since 2012 and is currently working on Physiological characterisation of human enzyme Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) in the Anders Virtanen group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Erik Gullberg
PhD student in Medical Bacteriology at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology at Uppsala University since 2009 and is currently working on antibiotic resistance in bacteria in the Dan Andersson group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center. So far he has published articles in PLoS Pathogens and Molecular Microbiology.
Erik Lundin
PhD student in Medical Bacteriology at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology at Uppsala University since 2013. Erik Lundin is currently working on bacterial evolution where he studies evolution of new genes and functions. Erik works in Dan Andersson group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Gunnar Johannson
Gunnar Johansson is professor in Biochemistry at Uppsala university. His  research is focused on enzyme nanotechnology and sustainable materials  technology based on biomass.
