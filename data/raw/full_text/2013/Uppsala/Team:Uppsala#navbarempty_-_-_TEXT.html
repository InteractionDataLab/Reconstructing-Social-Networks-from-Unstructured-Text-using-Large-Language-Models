Sabri Jamal
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in how nature and biology works.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I participated last year and had lots of fun. I wanted to use my experience from the previous year and try out the competition once more.
Magnus Bergman
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-In early high school.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-To gain valuable experience in fundamental laboratory work, as well as in working in a project environment. Of course, the social aspect of it also played a big part in my decision.
Malin Borg
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-My interest in biology started in high school and I thought for many years I would choose to study medicine. But when it was time for me to apply for university studies I realized I was probably better suited for biotechnology.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Biology
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-It sounded like a great experience! I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology and get more lab experience. I was also hoping this experience could give me some insight into what it could be like working on a project together with students/colleagues in the future.
Nils Anlind
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in how nature and biology works.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I participated last year and had lots of fun. I wanted to use my experience from the previous year and try out the competition once more.
Niclas Sandberg
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-During the first weeks in X (The Molecular Biotechnology engineering program in Uppsala)
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-It seemed fun so I thought it would be nice to try!
Alexander Virtanen
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I started to consider going into something with bio- when i was around the age of 16. It seemed like a fun field with many undiscovered mysteries as well as much work left to do.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I thought it sounded interesting and that it would be a good occupation during the summer. It is also similar to possible jobs in the future so it's a good idea to try it out.
Pontus Danielsson
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I've always been interested in how things work in the smallest of things. Bioengineering combines this on both cellular- and on molecular-level.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Biology
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-It's an interesting way to reach out to a broader range of companies all over the world and at the same time get an unique experience in the lab.
Thorsteinn Olafsson
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in understanding the world. So my fascination with science overall has been there for as long as I can recall.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-iGEM is a great opportunity to gain experience in the field of synthetic biology. To be given the resources to pursue a project designed by ourselves is invaluable no matter how you look upon it. Be it the increased confidence in a laboratory environment, project design or to feel the weight of our results and planning.
Christoffer Frisk
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
- I have always found biology interesting and the engineering part started at university.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Engineering.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I looked at it and it appealed to me, I think mostly because of the fact that the project is completely driven by students but also because it seemed like a good learning experience, and I wasnt wrong.
