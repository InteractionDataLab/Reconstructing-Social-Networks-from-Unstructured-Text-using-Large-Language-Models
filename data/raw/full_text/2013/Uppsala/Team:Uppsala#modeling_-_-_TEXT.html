Modeling
When we first set out to create this year's modeling contibution, we asked ourselves what we wanted from our project. None of us had much experience in the ways of modeling biological systems, so the first objective was to find inspiration for the project at hand. Naturally, the first place to look was the wikis of the teams that came before us. We wanted to see what other teams had accomplished, what they had brought to the table and perhaps what we thought could be improved in their modeling projects. After much searching, and more than a little contemplation, we arrived at the decision of making two different models, with two quite different goals.
Goal number one: Applicability
The goal of the first model was to create practical predictions about the systems we were about to create, and thus make better design decisions in order to achieve an optimal metabolite yield. This required a more sophisticated model that took into consideration all the complex parameters influencing a biological system. In the end, we managed to arrive to a model that did just that for the metabolic pathway producing p-Coumaric acid.
The kinetic model for p-Coumaric acid production can be found here We have also made a toxicity evaluation of the content of our yoghurt which can be found in the menu above.
Goal number two: Accessability
Our second goal with this year’s modeling project was to provide a more easy-to-access model aimed mainly to future iGEM teams. We found that while there are many excellent modeling contributions from earlier teams out there, the level of understanding required to take advantage of the information provided is quite high. Seeing as iGEM is an undergraduate competition, and not everyone participating have the requisite experience with systems like MATLAB, we figured that providing a comprehensive tutorial coupled with a simple model made within the bounds of a user-friendly interface would be a good contribution to this year’s modeling project.
The tutorial for modeling can be found here
