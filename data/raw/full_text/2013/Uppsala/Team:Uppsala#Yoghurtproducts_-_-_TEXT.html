The next generation of synthetic probiotics
Uppsala iGEM proudly presents a new revolutionizing way to produce food and healthy substances in probiotic bacteria. As a part of our human practice project, we have made a yoghurt as one of  our final goals. Of course, as a medium of carrying probiotic bacteria we are not only restricted to yoghurt. Our probiotics can be provided in a juice, pills and many different foods.
The reasons we did this concept product is as following:
We felt that we early on in the project wanted to have a clear vision on what our final goal would be.
This concept product makes it easier for us to explain for the general public what we are doing. We have seen that media and people is more interested in our project, because they can envision exactly what we are trying to accomplish.
By creating this yoghurt, we can use this as a tool to start a debate and discuss future applications of synthetic biology.
Our goal with this yoghurt is to make probiotic cultures produce all of our daily needs. When we use probiotics to produce nutritions, we do exactly what nature has done for us during all ages. With this, we can spare our nature, by going into the future with a totally new way to produce our food.
This is a yoghurt that contains everything in one drink. With this, people can forget about expensive pills and supplements.
Our nutritions are for example produced in the healthy probiotic culture lactobacillus reuteri, which in itself is very good for our wellbeing.
In the end, all of the genes that produces the different nutritions will be incorporated in the chromosome of our probiotics. This will eliminate the need for antibiotic resistance markers on our final product, thus eliminating the risk of spreading antibiotic resistance in our nature and ingesting them in our stomach.
