Hampus Elofsson
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in how nature and biology works.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I participated last year and had lots of fun. I wanted to use my experience from the previous year and try out the competition once more.
Karl Holdar
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-When I watched a documentary on the potential of biotechnology in the future.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-Because I thought it would be a good experience and lots of fun.
Emil Marklund
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-This subject has interested me for along time (that's why I started studying at the X-program) and this interest has unsuprisingly grown even more this iGEM-summer!
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I figured iGEM would be a fun and interesting way to spend the summer. Which it really turned out to be! When you participate in iGEM you learn alot and laugh even more.
Theodor Löwe
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-Can't really say when, but I think it's getting more and more interesting with every                     discovery since it opens up new, even more exciting opportunities for us who studies it!
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I took a course in synthetic biology last semester and found it really interesting so this became a natural follow up over the summer.
Ken Braesch-Andersen
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-During the first weeks in X (The Molecular Biotechnology engineering program in Uppsala)
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-It seemed fun so I thought it would be nice to try!
Victor Sjöstedt
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-During my years in upper secondary school, my favorite scientific subject was biology, because of how I saw from the many great achievements that we could change the world based on the many resources that can be found in nature and by applying methods of biotechnology to create novel, effective solutions to many of our industrial, humanitarian and daily needs.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Biology
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-Because of the experience it provides and because of how it affects the world around us; it is a great opportunity to learn new things about how the technical and laborative development of a biologically based product may be performed.
Kristoffer Lundmark
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-During secondary upper school
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Engineering
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-Because i think it's a good experience.
Marcus Hong
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-When I listened to last year's iGEM team's project presentation. I thought it was cool that you could create so much with bioengineering, sort of like playing God.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I was going to be free this summer and wanted to do someting different than taking a summer job. iGEM sounded interesting since you will do work on something that will lead to a result and not just labwork for the purpose of learning for an exam.
Lovisa Pettersson
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in biology but my interest in bioengineering didn't start until I happened to come across bioengineering when applying to university.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Biology.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I chose to participate in iGEM after hearing of a former iGEM-project that sought to decrease the desertification. The thought of students contributing to science this way was very intriguing to me.
