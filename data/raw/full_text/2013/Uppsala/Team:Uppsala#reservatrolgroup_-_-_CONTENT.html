			-This subject has interested me for along time (that's why I started studying at the X-program) and this interest has unsuprisingly grown even more this iGEM-summer!

			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>

			-I figured iGEM would be a fun and interesting way to spend the summer. Which it really turned out to be! When you participate in iGEM you learn alot and laugh even more.

				-During my years in upper secondary school, my favorite scientific subject was biology, because of how I saw from the many great achievements that we could change the world based on the many resources that can be found in nature and by applying methods of biotechnology to create novel, effective solutions to many of our industrial, humanitarian and daily needs.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Biology
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-Because of the experience it provides and because of how it affects the world around us; it is a great opportunity to learn new things about how the technical and laborative development of a biologically based product may be performed.

				-When I listened to last year's iGEM team's project presentation. I thought it was cool that you could create so much with bioengineering, sort of like playing God.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both.
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-I was going to be free this summer and wanted to do someting different than taking a summer job. iGEM sounded interesting since you will do work on something that will lead to a result and not just labwork for the purpose of learning for an exam.

			-I have always been interested in biology but my interest in bioengineering didn't start until I happened to come across bioengineering when applying to university.
			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
			-Biology.
			<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
			-I chose to participate in iGEM after hearing of a former iGEM-project that sought to decrease the desertification. The thought of students contributing to science this way was very intriguing to me.
