Uppsalas contribution to the iGEM community
For this years competition we at iGEM Uppsala 2013 have deposited 63 new biobricks to the registry. Biobricks such as tools for our new Lactobacillus genus introduced to the iGEM community, new basic components for the production of metabolites previously not found in the registry, an improvement of various biobrick parts and last but not least we have also deposited various parts that have never made its way to the registry before. Each and every parts performance has been extensively documented during its use and all of the information will be able to be previewed as an experience on each part.
iGEM Uppsala 2013 has worked hard on improving biobricks such as stilbene synthase BBa_K1033002 (STS) and 4-coumarate CoA ligase BBa_K1033001 (4CL) that were worked on by Rice universitys iGEM team 2008. These biobricks will now be available for the first time in the registry containing a complete description of our experiences with the part.
Finally iGEM Uppsala are proud to present our complete chromoprotein collection , a collection of reporter genes that are directly visible to the naked eye. All the chromoproteins from iGEM Uppsala team 2011 & 2012 will finally be available through the registry. We have also expanded our collection by introducing 8 new chromoproteins such as meffBlue BBa_K1033901, tsPurple BBa_K1033905, fwYellow BBa_K1033909, scOrange BBa_K1033913, gfasPurple BBa_K1033918, spisPink BBa_K1033925, asPink BBa_K1033927, amajLime BBa_K1033915
