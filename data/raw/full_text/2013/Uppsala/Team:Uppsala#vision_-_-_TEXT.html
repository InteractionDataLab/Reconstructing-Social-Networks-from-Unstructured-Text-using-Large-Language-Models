A new way of food production
This year iGEM Uppsala will create a genetically engineered super-yoghurt . Why?
Imagine a future where we can produce all of our nutrients in one bacteria. A bacteria that can be grown on any substrate, in any region in the world.  A bacteria that is also healthy for our well-being and our gut flora. A bacteria that is genetically modified, so that it produces healthy nutrients directly in our food. Why not use the possibilities of our already mutual relationship with probiotic bacteria? Probiotic bacteria is a natural part of our daily life and consumption, so it is a natural choice for food engineering.
This is exactly what we will be doing. We will make probiotic bacteria produce healthy nutrients, directly in our food.
Advantages of using probiotic bacteria
We wanted to make a project that uses the potential of synthetic biology, something that is not achievable with other methods. So we asked ourselves, why is a probiotic bacteria better then already existing methods for nutrition production? With our solution, we can:
Eliminate the need for extraction and purification of nutritious compounds from different biomateria.
Directly produce all nutrients in one food item.
Grow our nutrients on any substrate, anywhere in the world.
How will we achieve this?
For this, we choose to work with the probiotic lactobacillus species . We have two major goals this year. One is to genetically engineer this probiotic bacteria, and make it available for the iGEM community with new standard parts . We are making the new standard probiotic chassi for iGEM.   The second is to use our new standard parts, and make lactobacillus produce our nutrients with metabolic engineering. We will make the bacteria produce vital beta-carotene and the commercial and public attractive antioxidant resveratrol . Also we want to add different tastes, like saffron .  And why not make a synthetic sweetener, miraculin , directly in the bacteria?  These are some of the compounds we will try to express in our probiotics. For this second part, we will both design new biobricks, and improve on already existing biobricks.
Future of synthetic biology and food production
Will the world accept our yoghurt and the future of synthetic biology? Will it be safe to drink genetically engineered bacteria? Hopefully our project will open the eyes of people, and show humanity what is achievable with synthetic biology.
