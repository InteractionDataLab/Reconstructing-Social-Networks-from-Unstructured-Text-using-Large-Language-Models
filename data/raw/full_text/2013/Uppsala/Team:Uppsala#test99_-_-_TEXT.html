Anders Edlund
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been fascinated with life and biology. I started out studying economics but switched fields to biotechnology because I felt I had a stronger interest and I feel that there is a huge untapped potential today in this field.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Definately biotechnology.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I participated last year and felt that I learned a lot and that it was fun. I felt that it would be a great experience to do it again. I also feel the synthetic biology approach is very interesting and promising and I wanted a chance to explore it further.
Alona Nyberg
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-In early high school.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-To gain valuable experience in fundamental laboratory work, as well as in working in a project environment. Of course, the social aspect of it also played a big part in my decision.
Stephanie Elizabeth Herman
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-My interest in bioengineering began in my last year in high school, when I did my final project. I got the chance to work at Stockholm University and explore how apoptosis works at tumor human nervcells. It wasn’t exactly bioengineering, but later on I discovered that there was a way to combine my interests in building stuff and cell biology, bioengineering!
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I wanted to contribute to the growth in synthetic biology. Also I thought it was fun to finally do something outside of my studies.
Anton Berglund
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in how nature and biology works.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I participated last year and had lots of fun. I wanted to use my experience from the previous year and try out the competition once more.
Mikael Strandgren
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-During the first weeks in X (The Molecular Biotechnology engineering program in Uppsala)
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-It seemed fun so I thought it would be nice to try!
Christoffer Ahlström
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I started to consider going into something with bio- when i was around the age of 16. It seemed like a fun field with many undiscovered mysteries as well as much work left to do.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I thought it sounded interesting and that it would be a good occupation during the summer. It is also similar to possible jobs in the future so it's a good idea to try it out.
Viktor Blomkvist
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in biology, but it was not until I applied for the university my interest in biotech started.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Both.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I thought it would be nice to get some more laboratory experience and my friends who participated last year recommended it.
Viktor Törnblom
When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?
-I have always been interested in biology but my interest in bioengineering didn't start until I happened to come across bioengineering when applying to university.
Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?
-Biology.
Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?
-I chose to participate in iGEM after hearing of a former iGEM-project that sought to decrease the desertification. The thought of students contributing to science this way was very intriguing to me.
