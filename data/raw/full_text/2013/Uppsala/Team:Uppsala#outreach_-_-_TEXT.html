Media
We set out to involve people in our project as well as give people a chance to learn more about  biology. This we did through several media and social networks. Our University took a great interest  in or project and helped us set up an interview with Teknat samverkan at our Synbioday. Another of  the media we met up with was TV4, which is the biggest TV-network in Sweden. They interviewed  us in our lab to show an image to people of what happens in a lab and to ask about the project as  well as possible issues with GMO. To reach out to a broader audience we used Facebook and Twitter  which we consistently updated to let people who followed us know about our progress. Our biggest  prominent media appearance was at the cover of Nature Review´s tenth year anniversary edition  where our chromo proteins were published.

Figure 4. The graph shows how many people viewed our posts on Facebook from July to September. We can see that the interest for our Facebook page is increasing and our record for a single day is over 1500 people visiting.
High school
Another important work in human practice was to spread the word about synthetic biology to the    younger generation. One if the first things we did in spring was to travel around to different high    schools to spread the word about synthetic biology and iGEM. We have also started collaborations    with biotechnology high school students to do projects together with them in the future, with the    goal to spread the knowledge of synthetic biology.
