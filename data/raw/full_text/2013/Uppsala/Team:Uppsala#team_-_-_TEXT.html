Team iGEM Uppsala 2013
Team Uppsala iGEM is competing for the fifth consecutive year. This time we are a group of 26 under and overgraduate students in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology. We study at Uppsala University and it’s academic sister Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. Both are located in Uppsala, once the capital of Sweden and center of norse religion; and today home to the oldest university in scandinavia and a big life science cluster. Our lab is located at Uppsala Biomedical Center.
Because we are a large team we have decided to divide ourselves into three groups. Two groups have focused on metabolic engineering and one group focused on creating a new probiotic chassi.
