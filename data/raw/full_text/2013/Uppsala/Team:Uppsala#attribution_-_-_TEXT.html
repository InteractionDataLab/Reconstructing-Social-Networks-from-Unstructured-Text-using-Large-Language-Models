Collaboration
All of the work that was done during this project was both planned and executed by our iGEM team members. It all started of with some brainstorming sessions that began in the middle of May, although the actual lab work began in the beginning of June.
During the summer we have worked very closely with the Linköpings iGEM team 2013 . Since it was their first year to participate in the competition we decided to do our best to provide them with any assistance they needed, such as providing them with parts, knowledge etc.
In addition to assisting Linköpings iGEM team we have also sent biobricks to the following iGEM teams:
iGEM 2013 UT-Tokyo:
BBa_K592010 - amilGFP, yellow chromoprotein
BBa_K864401 - aeBlue, blue chromoprotein
iGEM 2013 Braunschweig:
BBa_K1033930 - amilCP, blue/purple chromoprotein (incl RBS)
BBa_K592010 - amilGFP, yellow chromoprotein
BBa_K592012 - eforRed, red/pink chromoprotein
BBa_K592011 - cjBlue, green chromoprotein
BBa_K864401 - aeBlue, blue chromoprotein
iGEM 2013 Tsinghua:
BBa_K592010 - amilGFP, yellow chromoprotein
BBa_K592012 - eforRed, red/pink chromoprotein
BBa_K592011 - cjBlue, green chromoprotein
BBa_K864401 - aeBlue, blue chromoprotein
BBa_K1033930 - amilCP, blue/purple chromoprotein (incl RBS)
iGEM 2013 CU Boulder:
BBa_K592010 - amilGFP, yellow chromoprotein
BBa_K592012 - eforRed, red/pink chromoprotein
BBa_K592011 - cjBlue, green chromoprotein
BBa_K864401 - aeBlue, blue chromoprotein
BBa_K1033930 - amilCP, blue/purple chromoprotein (incl RBS)
iGEM 2013 uOttawa:

BBa_K1033931 - amilGFP, yellow chromoprotein (incl RBS)
A special thanks
We would also like to thank other sources that have helped us, such as the Slovenian iGEM team 2010 that supplied us with the genes needed for the production of carotenoid metabolites, TU-Munichs iGEM team 2012 that provided us with the gene 4CL for the production of 4-coumaryl-CoA, and Wahington University's 2012 iGEM team WashU that enabled our work with the saffron pathway. Last but not least we would also like to thank the School of chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University for providing us with the genes involved in the production of the phenylpropanoid pathway. The article can be found at; Conrado RJ, Mori J et al (2011)
Other collaborations
In addition to this we would also like to mention some fascinating requests that have been made by external sources:
Nature reviews request to display our chromoproteins on their front page for their 10 year anniversary.
National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA) biotechnology department requested our chromoproteins as reporter genes for a project that is currently being worked on.
