BioArt
To explain what happens when a bacteria is genetically modified to the public is often challenging. It is often very abstract and the changes are invisible to the layman. To overcome this challenge we created bioart. Bioart  is an easy and fun way to illustrate the result of modifying our bacteria. By using parts from our own chromoprotein collection we made sure that the result is visible to the naked eye and no UV-light is needed. We used them for creating a bioart exhibition at our SynBioday . It was very effective at getting peoples attention. People were very curious of how we made the coloured bacteria. This gave us a natural way to introduce them to some basic synthetic biology.
