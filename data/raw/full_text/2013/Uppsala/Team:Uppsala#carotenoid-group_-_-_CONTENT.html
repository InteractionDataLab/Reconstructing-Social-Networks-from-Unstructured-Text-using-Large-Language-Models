				- Bioengineering is something that has always interested me although it was not something that I thought I would end up doing. As i became older I became more interested and realized the possibilities and that is probably when it struck me that this was something that I could actually consider doing.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				- I chose to participate in iGEM as a project manager this year because i think the concept is great. After my participation in iGEM last year I was quite sure that I was going to participate again although this time I wanted to improve iGEM Uppsalas brand within the university at the same time as I wanted to plan and work on a new project. . 
		</DIV></DIV><DIV id="profile-div"><DIV id="grid"><H1 align="right">Magnus Bergman</H1><DIV id="text-left"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
				-In early high school.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-To gain valuable experience in fundamental laboratory work, as well as in working in a project environment. Of course, the social aspect of it also played a big part in my decision.
			</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1>Malin Borg</H1><DIV id="text-right"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>
-My interest in biology started in high school and I thought for many years I would choose to study medicine. But when it was time for me to apply for university studies I realized I was probably better suited for biotechnology.
			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
			-Biology
			<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
			-It sounded like a great experience! I wanted to learn more about synthetic biology and get more lab experience. I was also hoping this experience could give me some insight into what it could be like working on a project together with students/colleagues in the future.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1 align="right">Nils Anlind</H1><DIV id="text-left"><DIV id="grid"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
				-My interest started in upper secondary school where I had the opportunity to try genetics and cell biology at university level. I also made my graduation project about promotors in fruit flies for alzheimers research, which I found very interesting.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-iGEM is a great oppertunity to try research and get hands on experience with synthetic biologi. That's a no brainer for me.
			</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1>Niclas Sandberg</H1><DIV id="text-right"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
			- I have always been interested in how things work and I think it is amazing that we can &quot;engineer life&quot;.
			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
			-Both
			<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
			-To be a part of an awesome team and do cool and important science. It's a good way to learn and to get laboratory experience while having fun!
		</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1 align="right">Alexander Virtanen</H1><DIV id="text-left"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
				-I started to consider going into something with bio- when i was around the age of 16. It seemed like a fun field with many undiscovered mysteries as well as much work left to do.

				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both.
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-I thought it sounded interesting and that it would be a good occupation during the summer. It is also similar to possible jobs in the future so it's a good idea to try it out.
			</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1>Pontus Danielsson</H1></DIV><DIV id="text-right"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
			-I've always been interested in how things work in the smallest of things. Bioengineering combines this on both cellular- and on molecular-level.
			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
			-Biology
			<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
			-It's an interesting way to reach out to a broader range of companies all over the world and at the same time get an unique experience in the lab.
		</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1 align="right">Thorsteinn Olafsson</H1><DIV id="text-left"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
				-I have always been interested in understanding the world. So my fascination with science overall has been there for as long as I can recall.
				<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
				-Both.
				<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
				-iGEM is a great opportunity to gain experience in the field of synthetic biology. To be given the resources to pursue a project designed by ourselves is invaluable no matter how you look upon it. Be it the increased confidence in a laboratory environment, project design or to feel the weight of our results and planning. 

			</DIV></DIV><DIV id="grid"><H1>Christoffer Frisk</H1><DIV id="text-right"><B>When/Why did your interest in bioengineering start?</B>	
			- I have always found biology interesting and the engineering part started at university.
			<B>Does your primary interest lie in engineering or in biology/biotechnology?</B>
			-Engineering.
			<B>Why did you choose to participate in iGEM?</B>
			-I looked at it and it appealed to me, I think mostly because of the fact that the project is completely driven by students but also because it seemed like a good learning experience, and I wasnt wrong.
