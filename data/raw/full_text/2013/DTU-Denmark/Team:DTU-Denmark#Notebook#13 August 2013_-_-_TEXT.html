Lab 208
Main purpose
PCR to amplify USER fragments of the constitutive SPL;
PCR of Nir2 with USER primers;
Gel purification of araBAD SPL.
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Henrike, Gosia
Procedure
PCR (promoter library)
PCR to amplify USER fragments of the constitutive SPL, the constitutive reference promoter and the arabinose reference promoter.
Used 5% DMSO, 2 uL of mM MgCl2 and GC-buffer.
constitutive SPL
template: pZA21::RFP
primers: 52a, 52b1
annealing temp: 58.1C
elongation time: 3:00
constitutive reference
template: pZA21::RFP
primers: 52a, 52b2
annealing temp: 58.1C
elongation time: 3:00
Wanted to make negative for the two above reactions but accidentally put the template in the master mix.
arabinose reference
template: pZA21:araBAD:RFP (labeled Ara)
primers: 51a,51b1
annealing temp: 60.3C
elongation time: 4:00

PCR mix according to standard protocol with changes: addition of DMSO in 3 different final concentrations (2%, 3%, 5%); two different buffers (HF 5x and GC 5x), amount of added water was dependent on volume of added DMSO.
Primers for Nir2 - 40a, 40b
Template - fragment Nir2 amplified with non-uracil primers, 3uL were used
Polymerase x7
Program A99, samles 1-6, was based on standard PCR program with 55 C and 1 min of annealing parameters and 5 min of extension time.
Program A1, samples 7-12, PCR with initial annealing temperature of 59C falling down to 53C (rate 0.1 C/min). 5 min of extension time.
Gel purification
Gel purified araBAD SPL from yesterdays screening PCR

Conclusion
SLP screening PCR
The PCR run with condition E (5% DMSO, 2mM MgCl2 with GC buffer) had the highest flexibility; it yields the expected product at different annealing temperatures: 58.4 C, 59.6, C 60.6 C, 61.9 C, 63.2 C, 64.6 C, 65 C.
