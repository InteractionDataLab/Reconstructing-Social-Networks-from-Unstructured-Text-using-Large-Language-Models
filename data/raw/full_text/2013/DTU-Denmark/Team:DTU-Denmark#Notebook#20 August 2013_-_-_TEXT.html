Two samples were lost because the lids opened during the PCR reaction and sample evaporated.
purification gels
Pooled Nir2 and Nir1 samples for Morten Nørholm that gave bands.

Conclusion
Something is definitely wrong with our gels. It seems the gradient PCR did not give the right product. Amplification of the linearized pZA21::ara worked.
