PCR-gradient
Newer PCR machines are capable of creating a temperature gradient in the wells during the annealing. This means that each tube in a row will have a different but fixed temperature. When the optimal condition for a PCR reaction are unknown this technique can be used to screen a lot of conditions during one reaction.  Here is an example of our use of a gradient PCR ( link ).
