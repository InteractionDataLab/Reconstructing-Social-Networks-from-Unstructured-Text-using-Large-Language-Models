PCR-touchUp
Example of the method of touch up PCR
Touch up PCR is a method of amplifying a PCR-product that have bad primers or are troublesome in other ways. This is an example:
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
50°C for 0:30 - Annealing
Temperature increment of 1°C/cycle
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 10 times
Go to number 2 - repeat 5 times
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
End
