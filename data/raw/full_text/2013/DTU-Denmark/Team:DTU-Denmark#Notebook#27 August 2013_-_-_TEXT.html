Procedure
PCR reactions
Set up PCR reactions for:
Biobrick backbone pSB1C3 with USER endings fitting for our inserts
constitutive reference promoter in pZA21 (for SPL)
pZA21::ara vector with USER endings fitting for Nir1 and Nir2 inserts

lab 115
Main purpose
Run Experiment 4 in two different samples aerobically in order to characterize the behavior of AMO transformants and the E.coli strain.
Who was in the lab
Ariadni, Helen, Kasia
Procedure
Adjusting the temperature to 37 degrees and calibrating the probes is described in Calibration protocol .
Following the protocol Experiment 4 , with the changes in the following steps:
step 2: 4 ml of the overnight culture growing in DM minimal medium with NH4Cl
step 3: from the experimental procedure where the OD was measured OD=0.0761 and 0.0720 for the AMO mutant. For the E.coli culture the OD was 0.0822 and 0.0947.The abiotic controls have OD= 0.002 and 0.0006.
Results
Colorimetric results
Ranges
Measuring range 5-150 mg/L NH4-N
Measuring range 0.02-1 mg/L NO2-N
Standard solutions
Ammonium - 66.6 mg/L (expected 39 mg/L)
Nitrite - 0.72 mg/L (expected 0.5 mg/L)
time (min)
ammonium AMO1(mg/L)
ammonium AMO2(mg/L)

OD at the end of the experiment
OD=0.2083 and 0.2232 for the AMO mutants. For the E.coli culture the OD was 2.39 and 0.1173.The abiotic controls have OD=0.00144 and 0.0004.
