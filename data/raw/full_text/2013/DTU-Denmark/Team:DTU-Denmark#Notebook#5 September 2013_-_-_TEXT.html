Lab 208
Main purpose
PCR for HAO with USER endings after purification
Who was in the lab
Henrike, Ariadni
Procedure
Gel purification
of HAO User (faint bands) and HAO ex (bright bands). HAO ex will be used as a template for new PCRs to amplify HAO User.
PCR for HAO with USER endings
Template: HAO extraction fragment (purified from PCR run on 04.09)
Primers: 18a, 18b
Two versions, one with 5% DMSO and one with 3% DMSO and two programs: Touchdown (62C -> 55) and a single annealing temperature of 59C.
