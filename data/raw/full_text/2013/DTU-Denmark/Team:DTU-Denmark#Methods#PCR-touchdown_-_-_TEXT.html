How to do "touchdown-PCR"
Touchdown-PCR is a way to increase the concentration of specific product by using a higher than optimal annealing temperature and then lower the annealing temperature by and negative increment in temperature each cycle. After a couple of these cycles the reaction should contain more specific product and therefore the additional cycles can be run on the optimal annealing temperature without getting any unspecific product. Below is an example of how a touchdowm-PCR can look:
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
65°C for 0:30 - Annealing
Temperature increment of -0.5°C/cycle
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 10 times
98°C for 0:10 - Denaturing after each cycle
55°C for 0:30 - Annealing
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 7 - repeat 30 times
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
