PCR for extraction of Nir1
primers: 41a, 41b
template: colony from plate. One colony was dissolved in 100 uL of MilliQ and 1 uL of this solution was taken as template
program: Touchdown PCR analog to program used on 01-08-2013 to amplify Nir.

Conclusion
Today's PCRs on AMO and Nir were successful when DMSO was added.
Lab 115
Main purpose
Run Experiment 2 . E.coli control measurement.
Who was in the lab
Ariadni, Natalia
Procedure
Adjusting the temperature at 37<up>o</sup> and calibrating the probes as described in Appendix 5.
Following the protocol Experiment 2
Changing the steps :
19. Add 0.5 ml of nitrite solution and continue by adding 0.5 ml after 10 minutes.
We added 0.5 ml nitrite again and then we took 2 ml of sample, we added then 0.5 ml and afterwards when there was any change in the curve we spiked with 0.4 ml of nitrite. We took 2 ml for sample in the end and we added  0.5 ml of N2O and 1 ml of NO to see if the probes are working properly.
Results
Colorimetric results
Measurements of standard solutions
Ammonium - 43.7 mg/L ( expected 39 mg/L)
Nitrite - < 2 mg/L (X10 diluted) -0.4 mg/L (with no dilution) (expected 0.5 mg/L)
Nitrate - 18.7 mg/L (X10 diluted) (expected 12 mg/L)
Measurement of samples
Ammonium
Measuring range 2-75 mg/L NH4-N
start point- no signal
middle point- signal <2 mg/L
end point- signal 0.7 mg/L
Nitrate
Measuring range 1-25 mg/L NO3-N
start point- no signal
middle point- signal <1 mg/L
end point- signal <1 mg/L
Nitrite
Measuring range 0.02-1 mg/L NO2-N
start point- no signal
middle point- signal 0.43 mg/L
end point- signal 0.79 mg/L
Conclusion
Problems with the NO probe and there were not proper results.
