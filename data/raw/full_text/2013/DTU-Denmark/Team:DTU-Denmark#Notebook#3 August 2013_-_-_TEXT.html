Lab 208
Main purpose
Make and isolate Nir in 2 fragments and thereafter verify the isolates by amplifying a smaller fragment within the two Nir fragments.
Who was in the lab
Henrike, Kristian
Procedure
Gel electrophoresis
Run 1% agarose gel on overnight PCR products.
Miniprep
Isolate plasmids from samples Sec2, cycAX, TAT 3-1a, TAT 3-2, TAT 2-1 using ethanol precipitation . Actually should have used the Midiprep kit from QIAgen. After ethanol precipitation continued with Midiprep kit step from step 9.
Purification gel
Purification of Nir 2 fragment by gel purification.

Conclusion
The gel verified that Nir1 high is the right fragment but also confirmed that the recurrent fragment on approx. 16 kb from whole Nir isolation is not Nir but unspecific product.
