Lab 208
Main purpose
USER reaction to integrate Biobrick K808000 (AraBAD promoter system) in pZE21 containing fluorescence markers
PCR
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Gosia, Julia, Henrike
Procedure
USER
USER reaction to integrate Biobrick K808000 (AraBAD promoter system) in pZE21 containing either GFP SF or RFP. Did doubles for both with 7 uL of AraBAD and 15 uL to compare. Standard procedure.
PCR
Performed PCR on lambda phage as a test of polymerase efficiency. (PHUSION polymerase test kit)
PCR on HAO and AMO with USER primer pair 17 with 3:00 on 54C and 18 with 3:00 on 59C respectively. Tried out both colonies (col) and PCR DNA template (pur):
HAO pur

Later on the day we made another PCR on cycAX with his-tag 5 rxn with primer pair 33 and 3:30 min extension time. This time with lower temperature:
2x on 50C
2x on 45C
1x neg. on 45C
