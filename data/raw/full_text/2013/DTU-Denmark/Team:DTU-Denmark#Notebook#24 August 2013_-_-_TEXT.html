The insert is confirmed for the colonies 3, 4 and 8.
Gel optimization test
Made two gels with TAE buffer to run on the two different power supplies and used two different loading dyes to try and resolve the problem with the bad gels we've been having.
Loading dyes: Agarose Blue was made by us, GelPilot is supplied by Qiagen. The const ref samples were mixed with agarose blue before, so we cannot test the other loading dye on those.
Run on the old power supply (the grey one):
1 kb
cycAX col 3, agarose blue
cycAX col 4, GelPilot
cycAX col 8, GelPilot
cycAX col 2, agarose blue
cycAX col 6, agarose blue
cycAX col 7, GelPilot
cycAX col 9, GelPilot
constitutive reference promoter, GC buffer
constitutive reference promoter, GC buffer + 3% DMSO
constitutive reference promoter, HF buffer

Run on the new power supply (the green one):
1 kb
cycAX col 3, agarose blue
cycAX col 4, GelPilot
cycAX col 8, GelPilot
cycAX col 2, agarose blue
cycAX col 7, GelPilot

Conclusion
There is no visible difference between the two power-supplies and loading dyes. Probably the TBE we made from powder was not good, we will use TAE from now on.
