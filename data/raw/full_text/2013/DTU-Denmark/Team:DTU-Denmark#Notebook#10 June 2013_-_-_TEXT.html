Making competent cells
Using the Protocol , we got from Andreas with following modifications to protocol:
made only half the amount
used falcon tubes
The competent cells were stored in -80 C freezer on the lower shelf
Autoclaving
following was autoclaved :
Eppendorf tubes
3 x 100ml dm water
2 x 100ml 0.1M CaCl_2 and 15% glycerol
1 L bottle of 0.1M CaCl_2
1 L bottle of 50% glycerol
200ml bottle of 1M CaCl_2
Solutions made
0.1 M CaCl_2 and 15% glycerol from 10ml 1M CaCl_2
30ml 50% glycerol 70ml dm water
0.1 M CaCl_2 from 100ml 1M CaCl_2 and 900ml dm water
chlorampenicol stock 1ml with cencentration 50mg/ml
Plates
24 ps with 10ug/ml chlorampenicol (CAP) 5 mg to 500ml
33 ps with 30ug/ml Kanamycin 0.3ml of 30ug/ml to 500ml
Transformation
Following the official iGEM protocol  :
BBa-I0500 plate 5 well 14N, then moved to -80C
BBa-I14032 plate 3 well 18H, then moved to -80C
Transformation efficiency test (0.5,5,10,20,50)
Incubation 2 hours with 300 rpm
Plates:
I0500 - no incubation on Kanamycin plate, one 20ul and one 200 ul
I14032 - no incubation on CAP, one 20ul and one 200 ul
all 4 had 2 hours incubation.
