Lab 208
Main purpose
Run gel with 9 PCR samples of Nir operon from Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Transformation of Biobricks
PCR reaction for Nir operon
Who was in the lab
Ariadni, Henrike, Julia, Natalia
Procedure
Run gel
3 samples from PCR on the 09.07.2013 using PAO1 as template source
3 samples from PCR on the 09.07.2013 using PCR purification of 08.07.2013 as template source
ladder broad range biggest fragment = 20 kb
3 samples from purification of 09.07.2013
Transformation of Biobricks
According to the iGEM protocol ( transformation protocol ) with slight changes.
step 1: 100 μl cells
step 2: 1.5 μl of the resuspended DNA
step 6: 90 sec (instead of 60 s)at 42 oC
step 9: Incubation without shaking

Comments
Kanamycin plates were of bad quality
Tetracyclin plates were made by adding 22.5 uL of tetracyclin stock to LB plates
Stock tetracyclin: 10 mg/mL
Final concentration in plates: 15 ug/mL
Conclusions
Nir forms a nice, but weak, band in most samples but the fragments are still far longer than expected. It looks like they are somewhere around 16 kb where we rather expected 9102 bp. We will try to cut down the extension time and see if we can get something out of it.
