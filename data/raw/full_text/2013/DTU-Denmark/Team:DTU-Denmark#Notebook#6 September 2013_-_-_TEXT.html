Lab 208
Main purpose
Add USER endings to HAO gene extracted from Nitrosomonas europaea
Who was in the lab
Henrike
Procedure
Repeat HAO USER PCR from yesterday with same conditions and programs
Template: HAO extraction fragment -isolated from Nitrosomonas europea- (purified from PCR run on 04.09)
Primers: 18a & 18b
Two versions, one with 5% DMSO and one with 3% DMSO and two programs: Touchdown (62C -> 55) and a single annealing temperature of 59C.

User reaction
was performed with HAO User fragment that was purified yesterday (but had low concentration) and pZA21::ara (promoter from the Biobrick K808000) and pZA21 with a tight arabinose promoter (from our SPL). Also Nir 1 User and Nir 2 User were ligated into the pZA21 ara tight for Nir. Negative controls were made for all three backbones.
Results
Gel 1
Gel of yesterday's PCR was empty (we lost the picture though...)
PCR was redone.
Gel 2
For the PCR results of today.
