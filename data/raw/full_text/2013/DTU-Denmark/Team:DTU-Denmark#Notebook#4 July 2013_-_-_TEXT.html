Lab 301
Main purpose
We want to view our cells throught a fluorescent microscope, in order to see if they have expressed GFP and RPF.
Hopefully we will see GFP in the periplasm and RFP inside the cell.
Setup an overnight culture of the 2 successful transformants so we can both MidiPrep and isolate periplasmic proteins tomorrow.
Results
We managed to see expressed GFP and RFP
Lab 115
Main purpose
Preparation for making competent cells based on the protocol .
