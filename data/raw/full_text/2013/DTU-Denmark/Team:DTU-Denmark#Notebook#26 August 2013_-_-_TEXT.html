Lab 208
Main purpose
Replating of TAT3-1a
Who was in the lab
Henrike, Helen, Ariadni, Kristian, Julia
Procedure
TAT3-1a replating
TAT3-1a construct transformants from glycerol stock (15-08-013) were replated on agarose plate with 40 ng/uL Kanamycin.
Glucose plates (USER reaction)
Remade USER ligation and transformation of HAO and cycAX onto plates containing a surplus of glucose. This should reduce the leakiness of the araBAD promoter and improve the health of the transformants before induction so we can recover more colonies.
