Lab 208
Main purpose
Extraction PCR for AMO
PCR for SPL (synthetic promoter library)
PCR for reference promoter
PCR for araBAD biobrick K808000
PCR to extract Nir2 from P. aeruginosa
PCR for araBAD and SPL with DMSO
PCR on Nir1 with MgCl2 gradient
Gel purification of Nir1 (from P. aeruginosa)
Plasmid isolation: HAO in pZA21 from USER cloning.
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Gosia, Natalia, Henrike
Procedure
PCR for AMO
Made four reactions using 1 uL respectively 10 uL of culture from the -20 or from the glycerol stock (-80) as template and adjusted volume of water accordingly.
Primers 10a, 10b.
PCR for SPL (synthetic promoter library)
template: pZA21 with RFP, primers: 52a, 52b1, temperature: 50C, time: 2:30
PCR for reference promoter
template: pZA21 with RFP, primers: 52a, 52b2, temperature: 50C, time: 2:30
PCR for araBAD K808000
template: K808000, primers: 12a, 12bn, temperature: 50C, time: 2:30
PCR to extract Nir2 from P. aeruginosa
PCR for araBAD and SPL with DMSO
Template and primers as previous.
PCR on Nir1 with MgCl2 gradient
Used previous isolation from a gel purification to make PCR for amplification of the strand. Used 5% DMSO as additive. The PCR was done with primer pair 41 and with x7 polymerase at 55C annealing and 5:00 min extension. Also we used 20 sec as denaturing time instead of the normal 10. The magnesium gradient was as follow:
0
1uL MgCl2 2mM per 50uL reaction
5uL MgCl2 2mM per 50uL reaction
20uL MgCl2 2mM per 50uL reaction
Gel purification
of the Nir1 fragment extracted from P. aeruginosa. Nanodrop: 8ng/uL
Plasmid miniprep
HAO in pZA21 from USER cloning was purified for restriction analysis. Nanodrop measurement: 180ng/uL
