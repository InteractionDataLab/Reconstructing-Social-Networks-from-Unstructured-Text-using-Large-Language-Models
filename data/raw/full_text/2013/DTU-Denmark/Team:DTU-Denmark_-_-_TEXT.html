Highlights
We successfully characterized ammonia consumption of our AMO transformant (Mutant 1) .
We constructed and characterized a synthetic promoter library built on the arabinose inducible promoter.
We successfully targeted proteins to the periplasm in our Hello World pilot project.
We modeled several aspects of the project including the kinetics of the system and the size of reactor required.
We conducted several events around human practices , including a biobrick workshop and a discussion on IP and synthetic biology .
