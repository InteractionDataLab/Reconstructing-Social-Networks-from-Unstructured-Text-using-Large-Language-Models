USER Cloning and Transformation
Materials
PCR product(s) 10X diluted BSA NEB buffer 4 USER enzyme 1 PCR tube/reaction 1 Eppendorf tube/reaction 100 uL competent E.coli/reaction 1 LB-AMP plate/reaction Drigalsky's spatchula or sterile glass beads Milli-Q water 96% Ethanol Gas Burner
Procedure
Label 1,5 mL Eppendorf tubes and place in freezer, remove LB-Amp plates from fridge and place at room temperature.
Mix the USERTM cloning reaction in PCR tube(s).
NOTE! You may also make a control reaction, where you mix all USERTM cloning components and the backbone PCR product holding the resistance marker, but adding Milli-Q water instead of the rest of the PCR products!

Incubate 40 minutes at 37C degrees, then 30 minutes at 25C degrees. Use old PCR machine.
While incubating prepare for E. coli transformation
label all LB-Amp plates
pick up competent cells from *80C freezer, thaw on ice
pick up 1.5 mL tubes from freezer, place on ice
aliquot cells, 50 uL cells per Eppendorf - pipette carefully
keep cells on ice
After incubation is over, add the whole USER reaction to the corresponding Eppendorf with competent E. coli cells. (You may also include a negative control, where no DNA is added to the competent E.coli cells)
Leave mixture on ice for 30 minutes (minimum 10 minutes)
Heat chock bacteria for 90 seconds at 42C degrees
leave mixture on ice for 2-5 minutes
Plate bacteria using a sterile Drigalsky (sterilize with ethanol and flame between each transformation - remember to cool down the spatchula on the plate before plating out the cells). Alternatively, use sterile glass beads to spread the cells on the plate.
Leave at 37C degrees overnight with bottom-up
