Lab 208
Main purpose
PCR for SPL and Ref (reference promoter)
PCR for AMO with USER endings
High yield plasmids purification of cycAX, Sec2, TAT2-1, TAT3-2 and TAT3-1a.
Gel purification of AMO, araBAD promoter and Nir2.

Who was in the lab
Kristian, Gosia, Julia, Henrike
Procedure
PCR for SPL and Ref (reference promoter)
template: pZA21 with RFP;
primers for SLP: 52a, 52b1;  primers for Ref: 52a, 52b2;
temperature: 53C, time: 3:00;
Samples:
1 -> SLP + DMSO
2 -> SLP + betaine
3 -> Ref + DSMO
4 -> Ref + betaine
5 -> SLP Negative control + DMSO
6 -> Ref Negative control + betaine
PCR for AMO with USER endings
Midiprep
Purifying plasmids with high yield for sequencing of the samples cycAX, Sec2, TAT2-1, TAT3-2 and TAT3-1a.
Gel purification
Extracted from gel and purified AMO extraction fragment, araBAD promoter and Nir2 extraction fragment. Nir2 was treated according to protocol for fragments bigger 4kb, the others as fragments between 100bp and 4kb.
USER reaction
Performed USER ligation on araBAD inducible promoter and pZA21 without native promoter containing GFP Sf respective RFP following the standard protocol (I assume).

Results
Gel on yesterdays PCR
ara, SPL is from yesterdays PCR with 5% DMSO, Nir and the sample numbers is also from yesterday, here the composition can be seen.

Lab 115
Main purpose
Run Experiment 2 anaerobically in order to characterize the behavior of P. aeruginosa
Who was in the lab
Ariadni, Helen
Procedure
Adjusting the temperature at 37 degrees and calibrating the probes as described in Appendix 5.
Following the protocol Experiment 2
Changing the steps :
6. 2 ml of the overnight culture in 100 ml of medium.
7. Grow the cells for about 4 hours where the OD was measured ...... in 500 nm wavelength setup instead of 600 nm.
8. We didn't cool down the centrifuge because the experiment had to be done in 37 degrees.
11. The volume was 140 ml instead of 200 ml.
12. The OD was measured 0.1195 instead of 0.3.
19. Add 0.5 ml of nitrite solution and continue by adding 1 ml after 10 minutes then we took 1.8 ml of sample, we added then 0.5 ml and afterwards when there was any change in the curve we spiked with 0.9 ml of nitrite. We took 2.3 ml for sample in the end and another 2 ml for OD measurement where OD=0.1105.
The temperature in the end was 40.5 degrees C and not 37.
Results
Colorimetric results
Ammonium
Measuring range 2-75 mg/L NH4-N
start point- signal <2 mg/L
middle point- signal <2 mg/L
end point- signal <2 mg/L but 1.8 mg/L
Nitrate
Measuring range 1-25 mg/L NO3-N
start point- signal <1 mg/L
middle point- signal <1 mg/L
end point- signal 0.4 mg/L
Nitrite
Measuring range 0.02-1 mg/L NO2-N
start point- signal 0.07 mg/L
middle point- signal 0.57 mg/L after X10 dilution
end point- signal 0.47 mg/L after X10 dilution
N2O measurements about P. aeruginosa
Conclusion
We were not able to see a response.
