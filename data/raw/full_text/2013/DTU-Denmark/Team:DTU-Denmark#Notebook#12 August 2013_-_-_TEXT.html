Lab 208
Main purpose
Screening PCR on pZA21:RFP araBAD
PCR reaction in order to amplify backbone pZA21 containing araBAD and RFP
PCR reaction in order to amplify Nir1 and Nir2 fragments
Who was in the lab
Henrike, Kristian, Gosia, Julia
Procedure
Screening PCR on pZA21:araBAD:RFP spl
8 different conditions and 12 different annealing temperatures were screened.
PCR mix according to standard protocol with adjusted amounts of water according to the amounts of DMSO and MgCl2 added to the reactions.
The conditions are:

Primers - 51a and 51b1
Template - "Ara" sample (plasmid isolation pZA21:araBAD:RFP).
Annealing temperature: each condition were run in the following 12 different annealing temperatures:
53.2 C
53.5 C
54.6 C
56 C
57.2 C
58.4 C
59.6 C
60.6 C
61.9 C
63.2 C
64.6 C
65 C
PCR mix for backbone
PCR mix - according to standard protocol.
Primers - 1an and 1b
Template - "Ara" sample (plasmid isolation pZA21:araBAD:RFP).
Program was based on standard program with 65 C of annealing temperature and 4 min of extension time.
Samples names: 1, 2, 3 and N (negative)
PCR for Nir1 and Nir2
PCR mix according to standard protocol with changes: addition of DMSO in 3 different final concentrations (2%, 3%, 5%); two different buffers (HF 5x and GC 5x), amount of added water was dependent on volume of added DMSO.
Primers for Nir1 - 39a, 39b
Primers for Nir2 - 40a, 40b
Templates - fragments Nir1 and Nir2 amplified with non-uracil primers, gel purified
Polymerase x7
Program (A99 - the same for Nir1 and Nir2) was based on standard PCR program with 50 C and 1 min of annealing parameters and 5 min of extension time.
Samples names:
Nir1, GC buffer, 2% DMSO
Nir1, GC buffer, 3% DMSO
Nir1, GC buffer, 5% DMSO
Nir1, HF buffer, 2% DMSO
Nir1, HF buffer, 3% DMSO
Nir1, HF buffer, 5% DMSO
Nir2, GC buffer, 2% DMSO
Nir2, GC buffer, 3% DMSO
Nir2, GC buffer, 5% DMSO
Nir2, HF buffer, 2% DMSO
Nir2, HF buffer, 3% DMSO
Nir2, HF buffer, 5% DMSO
