Who was in the lab
Julia, Kristian, Henrike
Procedure
Colony PCR to verify inserts HAO and Nir in pZA21::ara and pZA21::ara tight
Colony PCR on the Nir transformants, testing for NirH (primers 45a, 45b, annealing 59C), NirM+S (primers 44, 11a annealing 64C) and NirN (primers 43, 11b annealing 68C).

Colony PCR to verify HAO insert.
Primers: 28a, 28b
temperature: 59C
Results
Transfomation
Transformation on last friday gave the following results:
HAO in pZA21::ara (from Biobrick K808000) - 6 colonies (3 orange and small, 3 normal color and very big)
negative HAO in pZA21::ara (from Biobrick K808000) - no colonies
HAO in pZA21::ara tight - a lot of colonies, some very big
negative HAO in pZA21::ara tight - a lot of small colonies
Nir in pZA21::ara tight - 8 colonies
negative Nir in pZA21::ara tight - no colonies

The gel picture is inconclusive. We will do another colony PCR using the primers designed for sequencing.
