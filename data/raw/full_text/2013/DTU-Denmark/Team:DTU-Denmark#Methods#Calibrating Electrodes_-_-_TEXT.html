Calibration of electrodes
Calibration of NO and N2O electrodes/probes
Cleaning the probes
Prepare 96% ethanol solution
Prepare 0.01M HCl solution
Put both probes in ethanol solution for 1 minute
Put both probes in HCl solution for 1 minute
Rinse with demineralized water
Calibration
Make standard solution NO
Make 200 ml solution 1 M NaOH
Make it anoxic by bubbling with N2 for 5 minutes
Make MQ water anoxic
Bubble 5% NO solution through NaOH solution
Convey towards the water flask for 20 minutes
Make standard solution of N2O
Make solution anoxic by bubbling 5 minutes with N2
Flush with N2O for 20 minutes.
Procedure
Pure 200 ml of DM minimal medium in the bottle
Adjust the temperature at around 37oC by using a magnetic stirrer
Adjust both of the probes in the lid of the bottle
Connect the electrodes with the microsensors
Make the solution anoxic by bubbling with N2 for 10 minutes
Start by calibrating N2O sensor (the adding points are the concentration of N2O in mg/L)
Add the first point “0” on the sensor
Spike 0.5 ml of N2O in 200 ml  and add point “60.35”
Spike 0.5 ml of N2O and add point “120.7”
Spike 0.5 ml of N2O and add point “181.06”
Spike 0.5 ml of N2O and add point “2241.41”
Spike 1 ml of N2O and add point “362.11”
Spike 1 ml of N2O and add point “482.81”
Then apply the calibration for the sensor
Continue by calibrating NO sensor (the adding points are the concentration of NO in mg/L)
Add the first point “0” on the sensor
Spike 1 ml of NO in 200 ml and add point “0.47”
Spike 1 ml of NO and add point “0.94”
Spike 1 ml of NO and add point “1.4”
Spike 1 ml of NO and add point “1.86”
Spike 1 ml of NO and add point “2.31”
Then apply the calibration for the sensor
