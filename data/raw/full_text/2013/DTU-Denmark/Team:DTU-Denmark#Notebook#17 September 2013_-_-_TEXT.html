Main purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the long term characteristics of the growth of our Nir transformant anerobically. Specifically, we measure nitrous oxide production over a period of 10 hours.
Who was in the lab
Helen, Kasia, Ariadni
Procedure
Following the protocol Bioreactor .
Results
Nitrous Oxide measured in the bioreactor at the beginning and end of the experiment.

Conclusion
There were several sources of error in this experiment.  Most importantly, the experiment became aerobic in each chamber at 12:00, and the lab technician began sparging the reactors.
