PCR
Generel example on a normal PCR-program
98°C for 2:00 - Denaturing and warm up
98°C for 0:10 or 0:20 - Denaturing after each cycle
59°C for 0:30 to 1:00 - Annealing
72°C for 2:00 - Elongation
Go to number 2 - repeat 35
72°C for 5:00 - Final extension
End
Always use heated lid and set the machine to wait until the lid have the right temperature. If not default set to lid temperature to 104°C. The method will usually be changed with regard to annealing temperature and/or elongation temperature; depending the length of the PCR-product. Others methods can also be used such as "ramp-PCR" , "touchdown-PCR" , "touchUp-PCR" , "gradient-PCR" or a combination of these. In addition to these often used standard procedures there are tons of methods to do and improve your PCR and also for cloning and quantification purpose, e.g. Nested-PCR, Hot start-PCR, quantitative-PCR, Assembly-PCR and many more.
