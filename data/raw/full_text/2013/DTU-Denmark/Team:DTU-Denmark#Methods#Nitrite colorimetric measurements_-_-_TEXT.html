Nitrite colorimetric measurements
Nitrite colorimetric measurements
Measuring the concentration of NO2- in a cell growth experiment using Spectroquant kit
Material:
Nitrite Test Kit (#14776)
The liquid test solution should be performed to achieve a measurement between the ranges of 0.02-1 mg/L NO2--N Prepare solution with 0.5 mg NO2--N/L
Weigh 150mg Sodium Nitrite into 100mL volumetric flask
Fill flask with 100mL demineralized water
Dissolve to achieve a 10x concentration
Pipette 5mL of the solution into 45 ml of demineralized water
Expected final concentration 0.5 mg N/L
Performing Measurements:
Nitrite solution Measuring range of the kit: 0.02-1 mg/L NO2--N
Pipette 5.0 ml of sample into a test tube when it is among the range of measuring kit (otherwise make proper dilution).
Add 1 level spoon of reagent 1 (NO2-1).
Shake vigorously to dissolve.
Check that p.H. is between 2.0 – 2.5.
If required adjust p.H. by adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid.
Reaction time: 10 mins.
Pour sample into cuvette.
Select method in the spectrometer by entering the AutoSelector (little black tube)
Note the result
If the read is above the linear range then put the sample back to the tube test, dilute it and try again.
