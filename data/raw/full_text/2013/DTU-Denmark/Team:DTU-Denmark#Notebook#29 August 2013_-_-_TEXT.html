Procedure
Introduce endings for USER cloning in pSB1C3 for Nir construct
To make the transportation vector for HAO, AMO TAT construct and so on.
Reactions were made with pSB1C3 template from a PCR purification(Pur) and the batch that we got from iGEM HQ(HQ). 13 samples was made with each template and 6 was run on 58C annealing the other 7 was run on a TouchDown PCR. Sample composition in 58C PCR:
GC + 2% DMSO
GC + GC 4% DMSO
GC 1M betaine
GC + 5% DMSO
GC + 4% DMSO + 1uL 50mM MgCl2
GC + 4% DMSO + 2uL 50mM MgCl2
Samples on the TouchDown PCR:
GC
GC + 2% DMSO
GC + GC 4% DMSO
GC 1M betaine
GC + 5% DMSO
GC + 4% DMSO + 1uL 50mM MgCl2
GC + 4% DMSO + 2uL 50mM MgCl2

Introduce endings for USER cloning in pSB1C3 for Nir construct
In order to introduce our constructs in the biobrick vector we need to introduce special endings that are necessary for the USER cloning reaction. The table shows the composition of each reaction:

USER reaction
Performed User reaction according to standard protocol with the following parts:
AMO into psB1C3 HAO into psB1C3 cycAX into psB1C3
Sec-construct into psB1C3 TAT2-construct into psB1C3 TAT3-construct into psB1C3
ligation of pZA21::RFP with the constitutive reference promoter

Conclusion
PCR to get USER ends on pSB1C3 is substantially better with a TouchDown PCR than with a fixed annealing temperature. It does also positively affect the product yield to add 4% of DMSO and 1uL 50mM MgCl2.
