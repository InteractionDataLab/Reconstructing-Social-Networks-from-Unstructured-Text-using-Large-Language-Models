Lab 208
Main purpose
PCR to isolate Biobricks
PCR to make the constitutive reference promoter
colony PCR on Nir transformants
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Henrike
Procedure
PCR Biobrick Isolation
Used new primers to isolate Hello World constructs. Used HF buffer and tested three different concentrations of DMSO: 0%, 2% and 5%.
Primers: 56a, 56b
template: TAT2-1 (miniprep)

PCR constitutive reference promoter
Got new primers for the constitutive reference promoter since the old reverse primer (52b2) had a mistake. Repeated reaction set-up and program from the 13.08. Used GC buffer, 5% DMSO and 2uL 50 mM MgCl2.
primers: 52a, 52bn
