BioBrick Workshop
We planned and hosted a three-days BioBrick Workshop to introduce to ourselves and to students from the University of Southern Denmark and University of Copenhagen teams all the tools necessary to complete our projects. The workshop consisted of a mix of lectures, lab work and social events.
Full sequencing of BioBricks
We have verified the sequence of our submitted biobricks by sequencing them on the Ion Torrent that we are lucky to have on the institute. Depart from our own biobrick we saw the opportunity to fully sequence other already existing biobricks. 7 samples were picked which contain very useful backbones that every team get with the DNA samples from iGEM HQ. These 7 backbone bricks are the following:
pSB4K5
pSB4C5
pSB3C5
pSB1A3
pSB1T3
pSB3T5
pSB1AK3
Improving the parts registry
We did a lot of work to improve the parts registry by:
Adding full information about our own parts
Reviewing parts from other teams that we have been using
Adding a new page with the sequences of our pBAD SPL
Bricks of Knowledge
Filmed "Bricks of Knowledge" video on USER cloning for KU team.
