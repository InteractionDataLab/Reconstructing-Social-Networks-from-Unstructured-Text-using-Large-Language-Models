Lab 208
Main purpose
PCR of AMO and HAO using USER primers and as a template using AMO and HAO extracted from chromosomal DNA with non-uracil primers
PCR of Nir with new primers, template - cells of Pseudomonas
verification of PCRs
ON cultures and re-plating of Nir USER transformants from Colony PCR ( 17-07-2013 )
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Gosia, Julia
Procedure
gel electrophoresis
ON cultures and re-plating of Nir USER transformants from Colony PCR
Positive Nir USER transformants obtained by colony PCR:
Samples 25 and 26 were inoculated in 5 mL LB medium + 30 ug/ml kanamicyn for ON cultures preparation.
Samples 25, 26 and 27 were re-plated in LB agar + 30 ug/ml kanamicyn
PCR to amplify AMO and HAO with USER primers
AMO - primers 17a, 17b, 54 C annealing, 3 min of extension
HAO - primers 18a, 18b, 59 C annealing, 3 min extension
Samples: 1,2 for AMO contain linear template - fragments extracted from chromosomal DNA with non-USER primers, sample 3 contains 5 uL of liquid culture of Nitrosomonas europaea Samples 4,5 for HAO contain linear template - fragments extracted from chromosomal DNA with non-USER primers, sample 6 contains 5 uL of liquid culture of Nitrosomonas europaea
PCR to amplify Nir
New primers which do not contain uracil, polymerase Phusion is used. Template is 5 uL of liquid culture of Pseudomonas.
Nir is being amplified in two fragments. Samples are as follows:
1.1 and 1.2 - First part of Nir, primers 41a, 41b, 63C annealing T, 9 min elongation
2.1 and 2.2 - Second part of Nir, primers 42a, 42b, 63C annealing T, 9 min elongation

Conclusion
The PCR of AMO and HAO with User endings was unsucessful. Restriction analysis of the plasmid containing cytochromes did not show the expected result.
