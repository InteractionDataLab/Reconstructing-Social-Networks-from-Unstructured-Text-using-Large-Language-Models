Lab 208
Main purpose
Gel purification of Cyc and Nir
USER reaction for making His-tag on cycAX construct
PCR of Nir, His-Tag Sec, His-Tag TAT
Miniprep re-purification with columns
Inoculation of samples for midi prep
Who was in the lab
Gosia, Kristian, Natalia, Julia
Procedure
Gel purification
Gel purification was performed according to protocol included in QIAEX, Gel Extraction Kit.
USER reaction
USER reaction was performed according to standard protocol SOP1. We use DNA linear fragment containing pZA21 bacbone,cycAX with His-Tag sequence.
PCR
PCR according to standard PCR protocol.
Samples names:
1,2 - Nir 48 (primers 48a, 48b) on template of Nir (too long fragment amplified at the beginning of work with Nir PCR)
3,4 - Sec His-Tag, primers 19a, 19b; template: Sec 2
5,6 - Tat His-Tag, primers 20a, 20b; template: TAT 2 1
7,8 - Tat His-Tag, primers 20a, 20b; template: TAT 3 2
9, 10 - Tat His-Tag, primers 20a, 20b; template: TAT 3 1a
11, 12, 13 - negative controls as follows for: Tat His-Tag, Nir, Sec His-Tag
Program for samples:
1,2,12 - Program for Nir on Eppendorf machine
3,4,13 - 10 cycles 58.5 C annealing, 1 min elongation and 25 cycles on 67 C annealing
5-11 - 10 cycles on 54.5 C annealing and 25 cycles on 64 C annealing
Purification of plasmids after ethanol purification
According to protocol attached to the DNA purification kit, QIAGEN
Inoculation
For tomorrows mini prep 5 samples were prepared (all in shaker at 37 C, last line). To 10 ml of LB with kanamycin 100 uL of inoculum was added (from previous liquid culture)
PCR on Nir fragment 2 with GC-buffer
Same procedure as yesterday's PCR just with GC-buffer instead of HF buffer.
Results

Nir fragment 2, expected length = 5000

Nir whole fragment with KD primers, expected length = 9100
Nir whole fragment with KD primers, expected length = 9100
NirN, expected length = 1700

NirG, expected length = 650

Gel on todays PCR with his-tag and verification of Nir:

Conclusion
We have something that looks like Nir fragment 1 and further experiments will verify that. We speculate that the high GC-content can be the reason why we have had so many PCR problems with Nir and therefore we are doing the next PCR on Nir 2 with GC-buffer.
