lab 208
Main purpose
User reaction
PCR to amplify HAO and cycAX USER fragments
Who was in the lab
Kristian
Procedure
USER reaction
Redid USER reaction for ligating our inserts into the Biobrick backbone. There was no cycAX fragment left.
HAO in pSB1C3 AMO in pSB1C3
PCR to amplify HAO and cycAX USER fragments
Made 6 reactions for each, using either the extraction PCR fragment or the glycerol stock as template
