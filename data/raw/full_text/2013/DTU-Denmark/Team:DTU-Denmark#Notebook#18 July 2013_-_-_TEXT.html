Lab 208
Main purpose
USER reaction and transformation
Who was in the lab
Gosia, Henrike, Julia
Procedure
made gel for yesterday's PCR of Nir operon → empty
USER reaction with HAO + pZA21 and AMO + pZA21
nandrop measurement of yesterday's miniprep showed it had very small yield, so we will redo it
inocculated cultures for miniprep of RFP in pZA21 and cycAX in pZA21
dilution of new primers which arrived today
Gel electrophoresis - Nir, cycAX and plasmids from (3 with RFP, one with cycAX) miniprep
Gel electrophoresis parameters: 1% agarose gel, 80V, 55 min
USER reaction
Was performed by standard procedure
USER mix contained (per 1 sample):
USER enzyme    - 1uL
NEB buffer 4   - 0.5uL
10x BSA        - 0.5uL
backbone pZA21 - 1 uL
(pZA21 amplified with USER primers and DpnI treated)
Per one reaction we mixed 3uL of USER mix + 7uL of insert  Inserts: AMO, HAO, water (negative control)
Incubation - USER reaction
40 min at 37 o C
30 min at 25 o C
Transformation of chemically competent E. coli cells.
10uL of USER construct after USER reaction was added to 100uL of competent cells. Left on ice for 30 min, heat shock for 90 sec at 42 C and left on ice for 2-5 min. Added SOC medium, incubated at 37C with shaking for 2 hours. Plated on plates with kanamycin. Left overnight at 37C to let transformants grow.
Primers dilution
Primers arrived in dried form. We diluted it in 150uL of milliQ water (diluted 150 times) and saved as stock at -80C. From stock we took 10uL and added to 90uL of water (diluted 10 times) to make working solution of primers kept in -20C.
PCR to insert his-tags into the hello world constructs
Set up new PCR reaction for this purpose, using two different ramp programs.
ramp-1: from 60C to 50C in steps of 0.1C/sec
ramp-1: from 60C to 55C in steps of 0.1C/sec
Elongation time 4:00 for both programms
Conclusion
Gel photo didn't show expected Nir fragment and cycAX.
Nanodrop measurements and gel photo showed very low yield in miniprep. LB medium with kanamycin was inoculated again and tomorrow we will perform plasmid isolation using Qiagen kit.
