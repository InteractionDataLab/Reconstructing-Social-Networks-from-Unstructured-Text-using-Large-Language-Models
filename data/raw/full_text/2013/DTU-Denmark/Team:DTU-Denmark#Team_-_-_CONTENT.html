I also happen to be 2nd year MSc student of Systems Biology at DTU. I am a fan of bioinformatics, computational biology-based research and getting tan under a laminar flow cabinet (true story). And now that I still do not expect to be paid for my work I have decided to join the iGEM team to work on the damn cool project and put my skills to good use.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="display: table; height: 300px;"><DIV style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;"><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Helen_Cook"> Helen Cook </SPAN></H5><P>I've just finished the first year of my Systems Biology MSc at DTU.  In a nutshell, this means I write code to study biologically relevant patterns in genomic information, and I make predictions that can be tested experimentally.  
I joined the iGEM team because my concept of 'fun' includes dedicating my summer to work on a big project with other committed people.  Synthetic biology can be used to build a more sustainable future for us and our planet, and I'm excited to be a part of a team that is making that happen.
Also, I am quite fond of chocolate cake.

I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before.
When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all.
My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.

I come from Greece with a background in Environmental Engineering and my study line on the master in DTU is Environmental Microbiology. My inspiration about microbiology is encouraged while working with other team members from different study fields like biology, chemistry, biotechnology as we contribute in our ambition to complete this project.  When I am not in lab, university or class, I enjoy participating in film festivals and a photography team.
My favorite cake is brownies with chocolate and nuts!

I just handed in my MSc thesis in Computer Science at DTU. My main areas of interest are high-performance computing, distributed systems and web applications. I joined the team as although, I have been working in as a scientific programmer in bioinformatics for quite a while, I have never been able to experience the &quot;wet&quot; side of research. Besides, I like mocking Kristian for the late-night stays in the lab way too much. Banana bread &amp; coffee, anything else is a compromise.

My name is Gosia, I study Biotechnology at DTU. I joined iGEM team because I think it is a great experience to work with dedicated people interested in science. I want to learn more about synthetic biology, gain new skills and experience. I want to apply my lab experience in our project. My interests focus mainly on microbiology, Lactic Acid Bacteria, molecular biology and dairy products manufacturing. I like animals and plants, especially orchids and bonsai trees art. My cake is cheesecake.

I joined the iGEM team, to have a good excuse to do some wet lab work, while having the fun of doing a project over the summer. I like structural biology, and can spend hours in Pymol. I like setting up computational solutions, and will try to integrate structural biology in a protein-protein database search algorithm as my Master Thesis.
In my free time, I enjoy simple sports such as running and swimming.
My favorite kind of cake includes many blueberries and lots of chocolate.

I am especially interested in the mathematical modelling of biological systems. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to gain experience. I like to spend my free time outdoors and enjoy beeing so close to the beach here in Copenhagen. My favourite cake is Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.

I am a MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU, while my first degree was in Electrical and Computer Engineering at AUTH.
My Biology knowledge is left back in high school, but I have a personal interest in creating websites.
Therefore, I decided to join the iGEM team! Apart from that, I like working as a member of a big project and meeting new people! I enjoy dancing Latin and traditional Greek dances and my favorite cake is chocolate cake! The more the chocolate, the better the cake!

I joined the team because I believe that learning by doing is the best way to really gain new skills and have a better understanding of the field of your interest, and of course is more fun!! It is also my first time working in a team at university level, with people having different backgrounds, and cultures, something that makes this experience all the more valuable to me! My favorite cake is…well, whatever has chocolate! :)

I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to take active part in a research group (a really special one :-)) and because I wanted to spend the summer holidays working and having fun with wonderful people.
Although I enjoy the wet lab, lately I’m getting more and more interested in bioinformatics. For me computers are still mysterious machines that perform some kind of magic but  we managed to reach a level of cooperation.
During my free time I love dancing, especially salsa and other Latin dances. I also enjoy practicing yoga and swimming.
My favorite cake is Gulerodskage, carrot cake.

My original profession is on molecular biology, genetics and systems biology; besides, I have been improving my skills on computational biology and bioinformatics during my PhD. Thus, my life is a purgatory between lab and computer, when I am not playing drums or football. The lab had been so lonely before iGEM hard-workers were there and I am kind of sad that there will not be as many people around any more.
