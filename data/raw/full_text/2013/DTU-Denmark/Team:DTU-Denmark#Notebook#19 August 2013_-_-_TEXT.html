Procedure
Preparation of constructs to send for sequencing
Sec2, TAT3-2, TAT3-1a, CycAX and HAO constructs were prepared for sequencing. Sample preparation was performed following the indications given by the EZ-Seq service by Macrogen:
5uL of 100~150ng/ul plasmid + 5uL of 5uM primers.
An overview of the sample composition can be found in this file
The samples were sent to Macrogen for sequencing.
Gradient PCR for creation of Biobricks
Made a screening to find good conditions for the extraction of our constructs for subsequent ligation into BioBricks.

PCR to linearize pZA21::RFP::araBAD
Used GC buffer and 5% DMSO. Made three samples with varying concentrations of 50mM MgCl2: 0,5 uL, 1uL and 2 uL.

PCR on one of the Hello World constructs to confirm it's intact
Performed PCR on the construct containing Sec2 to check the template is correct because our PCRs on it are not working.

primers: sequencing primers 4_FW_pZA21 and 5_RV_pZA21

Conclusion
The program for Nir colony PCR works as a touchdown PCR and it have a big influence if you add DMSO or Betaine. It seems as 5% DMSO and no additional MgCl2 or 1M Betaine works best and somewhat equally good for both reactions.
lab 115
