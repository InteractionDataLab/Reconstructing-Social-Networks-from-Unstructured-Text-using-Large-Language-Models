208 lab afternoon
Main purposes today
Performing Colony PCR to verify if transformants contain proper construct (signal peptide, GFP, RFP - in plazmid pZA21).
Who was in the lab
Gosia, Ariadni
Procedure
Among colonies which grew after transformation 11 colonies were chosen to be verified by colony PCR.  Plates with transformants and colonies checked by colony PCR are signed:
T2 U2 Sec  - colonies 01, 02, 03
T2 U2 TAT2 - colonies 01, 02, 03
T2 U3 TAT3 - colonies 01, 02, 03, 1a, 2a
T2 U2 Sec stands for 2nd transformation, 2nd USER reaction, Sec signal peptide TAT2 and TAT3 is TAT signal peptide
All checked colonies were plated on a new plate, overnight incubation at 37°C.
PCR master mix for 12 samples (one additional just in case) was done according to Colony PCR method. Forward primer for colonies with Sec signal (PCR tubes signed: 1, 2, 3) peptide was primer for GFP Sec FW (5a). Forward primer for colonies (PCR tubes signed: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) with TAT was GFP TAT FW (4a). Reversed primer for all colonies was RFP RW (6b n).
In positive colonies amplified fragment of lenght about 1550 bp is expected.
