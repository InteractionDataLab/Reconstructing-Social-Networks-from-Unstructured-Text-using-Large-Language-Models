208 lab
Main purpose today
Make gel purifications to enable USER-reactions and to make PCR of the fragments missing.

PCR of AMO
Did PCR on AMO on two programs: 1-3 on 54°C 4-6 on 52°C Both with the annealing time 3 min.
USER-reactions
There was made USER-reactions with all fragments after purification. AMO was purified even though it was only one very faint band; the others were bright band. The following plates where made:
RFP USER - RFP inside pZA21
AMO USER - AMO inside pZA21
HAO USER - HAO inside pZA21
cycAX USER - cycAX inside pZA21
Nir USER - Nir inside pZA21
Neg. USER - pZA21 linearized only
Conclusion
PCR of AMO with USER-primers was not a success we will see if the new PCR have done better. We will evaluate the transformants on Monday with colony-PCR.
