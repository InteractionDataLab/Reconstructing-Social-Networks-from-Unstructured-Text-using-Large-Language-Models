Matlab function of design equation for reactor 2
function V = steadystate_cstr_volumeR2(f,S,P) %calculates volume of CSTR in steady state -> design equation % f = flow % S = substrate concentration % P = product concentration that will leave the reactor % we assume that the inlet water does not contain any product  kcat = 480; %[1/min]  Nir kM = 0.053; % [mM] Nir E = 8.457e-4; % estimation that cells take up 40% of the volume 1000 enz/cell  V = f*P/(((kcat*E*S)/(kM+S))*0.4);
