Lab 208
Main purpose
Make PCR on Nir with genomic DNA template. Amplify the pZE21 backbone with USER-primers for construction of the arabinose inducible system. Put His-tag on the cycAX construct.
Who was in the lab
Gosia, Kristian, Henrike, Julia
Procedure
PCR
pZE21::GFP SF and pZE21::RFP in duplicates with primers pair 13 on 55C and extension time 3:00.
cycAX in triplicates with primer pair 33 2 samples on 62C and 3:30 extension and 1 sample on 55C and extension 3:00.
None negative was made for each containing same things as real samples just MQ instead of template DNA.
PCR of Nir on genomic DNA
Two kinds of templates were used for this PCR:
isolated genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa
isolated genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa digested with HindIII
names of samples:
1,2 - primers 41a, 41b - undigested genomic DNA - part 1 of Nir
3,4 - primers 42a, 42b - undigested genomic DNA - part 2 of Nir
5,6 - primers 41a, 41b - digested genomic DNA - part 1 of Nir
7,8 - primers 42a, 42b - digested genomic DNA - part 2 of Nir
9 - negative, primers 41a, 41b
10 - negative, primers 42a, 42b
Miniprep
Isolated plasmids from yesterdays ON cultures of AMO colony 2 and colony 3 using ethanol precipitation .
Gel purification
The two successful PCR products of the plasmid pZE21 (containing GFP SF, respective RFP) without promoter were subjected to DpnI treatment and gel purified with the QIAEXII gel extraction kit (no spin columns).

Gel of Restriction analysis

Conclusion: The restriction analysis failed. We will load the uncut plasmid in differing concentrations on a gel to see if we can see a band.
Gel of Nir PCR
Gel of the PRC products from the Nir PCR today. See sample numbers in the entry in the procedure part.

Conclusion
No right bands where acquired from PCR-amplification with genomic DNA template.
