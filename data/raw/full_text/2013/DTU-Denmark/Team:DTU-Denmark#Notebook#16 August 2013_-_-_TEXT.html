Procedure
Gradient PCR for Nir2 USER
Set up new gradient PCR for Nir2 USER to run in 223. Reaction mix without MgCl2 but using DMSO and GC-buffer.
template: Nir2 extraction fragment
primers: 40a, 40b
additives: 5% DMSO
buffer: GC
Gradient went from 60C to 72 oC in 12 steps.

PCR for BioBrick construction
PCR amplified the constructs from Hello World and cytochromes and pSB1C3, which will be ligated together into biobricks.
constructs:
GC-buffer, 5%DMSO, 2uL 50mM MgCl2
primers: 53a, 53b
templates: TAT3-2, Sec2, cycAX
Tried two different annealing temperatures. Program:

SPL project
Picked single colonies of araBAD ref, constitutive SPL and constitutive ref transformants and replated them on plates sprayed with arabinose to prepare for Biolector experiment to measure the strength of the expression.
Preparation for sequencing
Diluted miniprepped plasmids down to 100 ng/uL. Have to redo cycAx in pZA21 purification because it was diluted too much.

Samples 5-10 and 12 were cut out for gel purification.
Conclusion
The amplification of the User-ready backbone was sucessfull, but we have to redo the PCR for the signal peptides and the cytochromes. Nir2 with USEr endings was sucessfully amplified.
