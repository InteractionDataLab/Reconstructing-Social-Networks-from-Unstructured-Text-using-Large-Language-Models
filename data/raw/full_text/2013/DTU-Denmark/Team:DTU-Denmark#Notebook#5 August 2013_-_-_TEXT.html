Lab 208
Main purpose
Colony PCR for HAO
USER reaction
Who was in the lab
Kristian, Julia, Natalia, Henrike
Procedure
Gels
Run 1% agarose gel on colony PCR products.  The samples are named:
HAO 1
HAO 2
HAO 3
HAO 4
HAO 5
HAO 6
HAO 7
HAO 8
Samples 1-5 and 8 were top10 transformant colonies.
Colonies 1-5 were small (1mm wide) more condense and more difficult to collect; this may be due to the proteins expressed on the membrane that make it thicker.
Colony 8 was wider (3mm wide) and more sticky.
Samples 6 and 7 are normal transformant colonies.
Colony PCR
To check HAO transformants from USER cloning on the 01.08.
Nanodrop
Measured Midiprep from 03.08.. No DNA was detectable in the samples. Redo purification.
PCR
PCR for araBAD with new RV primer, SPL (synthetic promoter library) in pZA21 and reference promoter in pZA21.
samples:
ara1, ara 2 - primers 12a + 12bn, template K808000, 57C, 1:00
spl1, spl2 - primers 52a + 52b1, template RFP in pZA21, 54C, 2:30
ref1, ref2 - primers 52a + 52b2, template RFP in pZA21, 54C, 2:30
PCR with Taq hot start
Used AmpliGold on:
Nir1 colony
Nir2 colony
Nir1 isolated fragment
Nir1 colony with x7 polymerase instead of Taq.
Reactions where done in duplicates with 5% DMSO in all reactions and they where incubated on the following program:
