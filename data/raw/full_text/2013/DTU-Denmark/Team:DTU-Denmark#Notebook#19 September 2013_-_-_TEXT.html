Lab 115
Main purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to measure nitric and nitrous oxide from the Nir transformant anaerobically while we spike it with nitrite.
The Experiment 2 describes further our investigation.
Who was in the lab
Kasia, Ariadni
Procedure
This experiment is based on the Protocol of Experiment 2 for the Nir transformant, with some changes.
The experiment started with a temperature of around 37 o C, initial OD of 0.1036 and initial volume of 200 ml. After resuspension the OD was really low around 0.0329.
The experiment starts, taking one sample and after 7 minutes, a second spike and then we spike with 2ml of nitrite and we take two samples. Afterwards we also spike with 2 ml of nitrite again and finally take one more sample.
