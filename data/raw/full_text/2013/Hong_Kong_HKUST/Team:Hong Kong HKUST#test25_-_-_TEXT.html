Wendi, XIAO WENDI
Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys play around in lab and is regarded as a potential "hazard" because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plan for future, most probably she'll pursue a master degree abroad.
Little Known Facts:
Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her do the gel-run along! Nothing will appear on the gel photo...and the gel melts.
