Her being a silver medalist in the International Biology Olympiad probably made you think that biology is her strongest virtue. Nope. It's her ability to annoy people in the lab with her singing while doing...well, everything. Her plans after UST involves earning an MD in the States and joining the cast of The Big Bang Theory.<B>Word of Wisdom</B>:<I>When lab gives you lemon, it's time to reflect on your competent cells.</I></DIV><DIV id="winnieinfo" class="info"><H3>Winnie, HUI WAI IN</H3>Winnie is a Year 2 Biology student. After entering HKUST, she would like to try anything new to her. Therefore, she joins iGEM Team to explore synthetic biology and to enjoy the lab work with people from various countries. Besides enriching her knowledge, she hopes to gain precious memory and friendship in iGEM.<B>Food for Thoughts</B><I>Although there may be failure in the experiment, it is really exciting to see our result come out!</I></DIV><DIV id="doyleinfo" class="info"><H3>Doyle, JIHWAN LEE</H3>Doyle is a first year Molecular Biomedical Science student. He ultimately plans to work in an international organization related to public health. He was born in South Korea, but lived his life mostly abroad in Bangladesh and Thailand. <B>Doyle's Two Cents on Life:</B><I>Doyle sometimes feel envy toward the liver cells that he cultures. He thinks they live under no stress and tension unlike his neuron cells in his brain.</I></DIV><DIV id="cecilinfo" class="info"><H3>Cecilia, SHI XI LIN</H3>Cecilia is a sophomore majoring in financial mathematics and statics. As a non-biology related student, she only knows a little about synthetic biology. She joined iGEM to explore the mystery of biology. She feels excited to work with a group of passionate and outstanding students and appreciates the help from them.<B>Lab Mood-Booster:</B><I>LB smells good!</I></DIV><DIV id="wilsoninfo" class="info"><H3>Wilson, HO CHUN PONG</H3>Wilson is a year 2 Biochemistry and Cell Biology student. His favourite things to do outside the lab is distance-running, eating and sleeping. He is not sure about what to do after graduation, maybe he will apply for being a firefighter, or any other things that he is interested in.<B>Random Info:</B><I>Wilson loves daydreaming. When he is doing so, he will sit there, do nothing, and think nothing. Sometimes it seems he  short-circuited.</I></DIV><DIV id="lynninfo" class="info"><H3>Lynn, WANG YU QI</H3>As a sophomoric biochemstry student, Lynn is a hard working girl with an optimistic attitude towards life. She has a good sense of humor that would always make her friends happy. Lynn plans to pursuit further study in US after graduate from HKUST, where she has her memorable university life.<B>Cherished Lab Memories:</B><I>Lynn is in charge of using GCMS to quantify fatty acid. However, during the sample preparation, she used droppers to absorb organic layer together with some water into the tube. That makes the FA concentration measurement to be 0 after one day's  waiting.</I></DIV><DIV id="satieninfo" class="info"><H3>Satien, SATIEN WILIAWATY</H3>Satien Wiliawaty came from Jakarta, Indonesia and born in 1994. This is her second year in UST. Her major is Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She loves watching movies, editing, and singing. She join iGEM because she want to learn more about synthetic biology. After UST, she might take further studies in the same field or different field or maybe find a job. We never know what will be happen in the future.<B>She loves to..</B><I>Eat lunch while waiting for digestion and running the gel.</I></DIV><DIV id="wendiinfo" class="info"><H3>Wendi, XIAO WEN DI</H3>Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology. She enjoys play around in lab and is regarded as a potential &quot;hazard&quot; because of that. Right now she doesn't have any plan for future, most probably she'll pursue a master degree abroad.<B>Little Known Facts:</B><I>Greet her! Little Wendi! Don't let her do the gel-run along! Nothing will appear on the gel photo...and the gel melts.</I></DIV><DIV id="wendiinfo" class="info"><H3>Wendi, XIAO WEN DI</H3>Wendi is a year 2 student majoring in Biology.

Stephy is one of graphic design team members, and she mostly spent her weeks in finding the right companies for printing iGEM needs. Stephy is planning to go for further study in America or wherever outside Hong Kong.<B>What We Do that People Don't:</B><I>Every Thursday, we have KOR103 course in MBMS lab, which is conducted by our leader, Chloe Eonni! Great, right? We learnt a lot! LOL ;D</I></DIV><DIV id="chloeinfo" class="info"><H3>Chloe, HYUN JUNG LEE</H3>Chloe is sophomore majoring in Biochemistry. She learned soooooooo much going through iGEM but it was also really really stressful and tough process!!<B>Random things:</B><I>She really doesn't understand why the Gibson Assmbly for ACEB contruct did not work out. It should at least have the same number of colonies as the negative control, how can it have no colony at all!!! The Gibson Assembly mix certainly have affected the DNA fragments in some way...Is it possible that a gene is toxic to its native strain? Also, for BBa_J176171!! She confirmed that the linear plasmid is stable at 50°C but why does it not assemble with complementary sequences engineered in GFP? Can we really trust sequence of this part? If this is heat sensitive, how can we confirm its sequence?</I></DIV><DIV id="astridinfo" class="info"><H3>Astrid, ASTRID SEPHIRA ALIM</H3>Astrid is a sophomore in HKUST, and studying Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Astrid works in sub-group 2 and mostly does the inoculation, which might be too many times so she got a new nickname, &quot;Inoculation girl&quot;! For now, Astrid still has no clear plan at all after leaving UST, however she absolutely wants to go for further study or find something to do.<B>Cherished Lab Memories:</B><I>** Astrid's sub group conversation. **
How to do the gel photo?
- Take your phone out.
- Unlock your phone.
- Choose the camera function button.
And, it is doonnneee! @#$%^&amp;$^#&amp;@</I></DIV><DIV id="raulinfo" class="info"><H3>Raul, RAUL GUILLERMO MEDINA CUELLAR</H3>Don't let Raul's severe-looking appearance and intimidating silence deceive you: he is the nicest guy on earth! As soon as he gets to know you, he will start taking care of you as if you were a little brother/sister! His great passions are biology, chemistry and all  that has to do with those fields (Don't get him started on synthetic biology!!) His bright future definitely lies within the walls of a lab!<B>Raul's <I>You-Ought-Know</I>:</B><I>HE IS A PRO AT TERRIBLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES!!!
