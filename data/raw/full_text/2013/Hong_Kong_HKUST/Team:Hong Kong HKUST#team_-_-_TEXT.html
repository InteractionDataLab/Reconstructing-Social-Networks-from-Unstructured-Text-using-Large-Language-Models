TEAM SPIRIT!
Our team consists of thirteen bright undergrads, working eagerly for nine months, transforming our project design into reality. With the kind help of our advisors and instructors, we managed to make the most of our time. We learned, grew and bonded together over the (mostly) stressful hours of digestion, gel electrophoresis, PCR and ligation. These are the people with whom we celebrated when things went right, and who propped us up when things were less than right. We wanted you to know them and us better. Don't be afraid to say HI if you see us in the Regional Jamboree. Who knows, maybe we might end up doing research together in the future!
