Experiment 1: Glyoxylate Shunt
Introduce glyoxylate enzymes responsible for the shunt
Experiment 2: Protein Trafficking
Target ACE proteins into mitochondria
Experiment 3: Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
Introduce inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentration
Experiment 4: Cell Viability & Fatty Acid Quantification
Measuring cell viability at different fatty acid concentration & measure fatty acid uptake rate
Our project was first proposed in mid-March and after a series of improvement and elaboration, we started our wet lab work from mid-June to late-September. After 3 months of memorable diligent work, we are proud to claim that we have achieved the results below:
Successfully constructed two parts carrying mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS) compatible with RFC 10 and RFC 25 assembly standards respectively, ( BBa_K1119000 , BBa_K1119001 ).
Successfully constructed parts containing the aceA and aceB elements of the glyoxylate shunt ( BBa_K1119002 , BBa_K1119003 ).
Successfully constructed a part containing the constitutive CMV promoter ( BBa_K1119006 ).
Successfully characterized the constitutive CMV promoter in HEK293FT cells ( BBa_K1119008 ).
Successfully constructed a part containing the constitutive regulatory promoter of Human Elongation Factor 1-alpha ( BBa_K1119010 ).
Successfully characterized the constitutive EF-1alpha promoter in HEK293FT cells ( BBa_K1119011 ).
Successfully characterized the mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS) in HEK293FT cells ( BBa_K1119009 ).
Successfully tested HepG2 cell viability in different sodium palmitate concentrations.
