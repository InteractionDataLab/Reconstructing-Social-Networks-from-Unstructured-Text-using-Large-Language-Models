Wetlab
The wet lab started at the beginning of summer and lasted for three months. Our wet lab work is divided into four parts, namely: (1) cell viability and fatty acid quantification, (2) fatty acid sensing mechanism, (3) mitochondrial leader sequence, and (4) construction of glyoxylate shunt. During the summer, lab work such as primer design, digestion, and ligation was carried out extensively and useful data were collected. These can be retrieved from Notebook and Protocols pages for details of experimental flows. The BioBrick, researcher, environmental and university safety issues can be found in Safety page. In terms of project process, some experiments could not be completed due to time constrains and they are outlined in Future Work page.
