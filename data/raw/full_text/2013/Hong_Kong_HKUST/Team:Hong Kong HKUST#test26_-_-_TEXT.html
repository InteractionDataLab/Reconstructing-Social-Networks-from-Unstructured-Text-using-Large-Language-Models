Team:Hong Kong HKUST/test26
From 2013.igem.org
Advisors
Here are our amazing advisors. They are the one who lead us to success!
Trevor
Trevor is beginning his MPhil program in Bioengineering in HKUST during the summer. After spending three years, he finally discovered what he longed for was not just the wonders of life per se but the power to accurately control it. Thus he shall begin the study through understanding promoters.
Funny random things:
After years of trial and error and literature search and experiment, he still can't figure out why agarose gels are so inconsistent in giving presentable figures.
Steven
Steven is a year 2 MBMS student who plan to apply for graduate school after UST.
Funny random things:
Always having acute memory lost and wondering whether he has added primer, enzyme or DNA during experiment preparation. Luckily, the result usually turns out to be fine.
Bida
Bida is a second year student majoring in Biology. He has participated in iGEM 2012 and is currently an advisor of iGEM 2013 HKUST. He plan to advance his study in the US after graduation
Funny random things:
I hate 0.8% gel. It's really fragile!
Cosmos
Cosmos, um, is an interesting person. You can see from his name. (Com'on, who will pick up a name like this!) He is currently studying biochemistry in HKUST, and in his year 02. It seems that life science is quite his taste, and he never never said that it was boring to memorize a lot of molecules and pathways. Never.
Funny random things:
A quote from a Dashen: "Biochemistry is playing with water." End quote.

Sean
Sean is a rising 3rd year majoring in biology, and was a member of HKUST's 2012 iGEM team. Following graduation, Sean hopes to pursue further study in conservation biology and earth sciences... or maybe physiology. He is still not too sure!
Qi Yi Diana
Diana is a year 1 student majoring in biochemistry currently. She plans to go abroad for further studies after graduation from UST
Funny random things:
Lab work impression: totally physical training, requires a strong body.

Xu Kaichun Wendy
Wendy is now a year 2 biochemistry student in HKUST. She loves doing different experiments and like using different approaches to solve problems and enjoy the lab work. She plans to continue doing research after graduation.
Funny random things:
Having been participated in iGEM for almost 3 years, I am happy to see the diversity of iGEM projects in HKUST and also each year different lab techniques are involved. I hope in the future HKUST iGEM team can keep better and better.
