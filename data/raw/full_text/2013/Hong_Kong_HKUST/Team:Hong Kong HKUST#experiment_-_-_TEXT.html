Summary of experiments done this summer - The HKUST iGEM 2013 carried out a lot of experiments this summer, including regular plasmid construction, PCR, and mutagenesis. We listed the main experiments done under each module in a clear, forward way.
Experiment 1: Cell Viability & Fatty Acid Quantification
Measuring cell viability at different fatty acid concentration & measure fatty acid uptake rate
Experiment 2: Fatty Acid Sensing Mechanism
Introduce inducible system that allows tunable fatty acid uptake by sensing fatty acid concentration
Experiment 3: Protein Trafficking
Target ACE proteins into mitochondria
Experiment 4: Glyoxylate Shunt
Introduce glyoxylate enzymes responsible for the shunt
