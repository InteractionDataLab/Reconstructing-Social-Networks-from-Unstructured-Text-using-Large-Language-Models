summary
lab work
A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system / B - PCB sensing system
1 - Gel extraction of PSB1C3 Clean for Gibson digested Dnp1
Protocol : Gel extraction
2 -Gel electrophoresis of product gel extraction.
[[]]
Well 1 : 6µL DNA Ladder
Well 2 : 3µL of product gel extraction+1µl of 6X loading dy
Gel : 1.0%
product quantification
We used the nano drop to measure the DNA in 260nm and we found its concentration
name
PSB1C3 clean for Gibson
conc.
37.2ng/µl
i
We use it to do Gibson assembly .
3- Gibson assembly.
RBS_BphR2_part1, BphR2_part2 and plasmid PSB1C3
FNR_part1, FNR part1 and plasmid PSB1C3
RBS_FNR part1, FNR_part2 and plasmid PSB1C3
Sample Volume:
Tube 1 : RBS_BphR2 part1(1ul), BphR2 part2(1ul) , plasmid PSB1C3(3ul),MIX Gibson (15 ul)
Tube 2 : FNR part1(1ul), FNR part2(1ul) , plasmid PSB1C3(3ul),MIX Gibson (15 ul)
Tube 3 : RBS_FNR part1(1ul), FNR part2(1ul) , plasmid PSB1C3(3ul),MIX Gibson (15 ul)
These 3 mixture is incubated at 50°C for up to one hour. Transformation and spread in 6 LB plates with Chlorenphenicol . Incubate at 37°C over night.
