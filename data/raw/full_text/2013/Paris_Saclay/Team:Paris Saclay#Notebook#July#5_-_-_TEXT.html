1 Notebook : July 5
1.1 Lab work
1.1.1 A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
1.1.1.1 Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155000
1.1.1.2 1 - Electrophoresis of the digestion of BBa_K1155000 by NotI, HpaI, MluI
1.1.1.3 2 - Extraction of BBa_K1155000 from DH5α
1.1.1.4 Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
1.1.1.5 1 - Extraction of BBa_K592009 and BBa_I732017 from DH5α

Lab work
A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155000
1 - Electrophoresis of the digestion of BBa_K1155000 by NotI, HpaI, MluI
Sheng, Zhou
Well 1, 2 : 5µL of BBa_K1155000 digested by Not I+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 3, 4 : 5µL of BBa_K1155000 digested by Hpa I+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 5 : 6µL of DNA Ladder
Well 6, 7 : 5µL of BBa_K1155000 digested by Mlu I+1µL of 6X loading dye
Gel 0.8%
Expected sizes :
BBa_K1155000 : 111bp
We didn't obtain fragments at the right size. We will do digestions again.
2 - Extraction of BBa_K1155000 from DH5α
Abdou
Transformation of 07/04 works. We will extract DNA plasmid.
Protocol : High copy plamid extraction
Nanodrop :
BBa_K1155000 : 761ng/µl
By using NanoDrop, we found some errors which could be due to device malfunctional issue.
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
