1. Incubate at 37°C for 10-90min
2. Inactivate digestion of enzymes by ethanol precipitation
Ligation:
Ligation is the method for the joining of nucleic acid fragments throught the action of enzyme.
Protocol
Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. (T4 DNA Ligase should be added last. Note that the table shows a ligation using a molar ratio of 1:3 vector to insert.) COMPONENT  20 μl REACTION
10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer*  2 μl
Vector DNA (3 kb)  50 ng (0.025 pmol)
Insert DNA (1 kb)  50 ng (0.076 pmol)
Nuclease-free water  to 20 μl
T4 DNA Ligase  1 μl
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly. For cohesive (sticky) ends, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes. For blunt ends or single base overhangs, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours (alternatively, high concentration T4 DNA Ligase can be used in a 10 minute ligation). Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
