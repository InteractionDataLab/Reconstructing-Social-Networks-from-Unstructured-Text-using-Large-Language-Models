Achievements
Bronze
The following 5 goals must be achieved:
Team registration.
Official profile
Complete Judging form.
Team wiki.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
BBa_K1155000 , BBa_K1155001 , BBa_K1155002 , BBa_K1155003 , BBa_K1155004 , BBa_K1155005 , BBa_K1155006 , BBa_K1155007 , BBa_K1155008 , BBa_K1155009
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals must be achieved :
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
BBa_K1155000 , BBa_K1155003
Document the characterization of this part in the "Main Page" section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
BBa_K1155000 , BBa_K1155003
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
BBa_K1155000 , BBa_K1155003
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
Environmental implications
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following :
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
BBa_K592009 ⇒ BBa_K1155003
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Collaborations
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
