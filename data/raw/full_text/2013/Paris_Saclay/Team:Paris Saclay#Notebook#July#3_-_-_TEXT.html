1 Notebook : July 3
1.1 Lab work
1.1.1 A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
1.1.1.1 Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155000
1.1.1.2 1 - Colony PCR of BBa_K1155000 to check good insertion of Pndh* in pSB1C3
1.1.1.3 2 - Culture of BBa_K1155000
1.1.1.4 Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
1.1.1.5 1 - Culture of BBa_I732017, BBa_K592009

Lab work
A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155000
1 - Colony PCR of BBa_K1155000 to check good insertion of Pndh* in pSB1C3
Abdou, Sheng, Zhou
Tranformation of 07/02/13 works. We will do a PCR colony.
Colonies count for BBa_K1155000 :
Standard concentration :
BBa_K1155000 : 0 colony
High concentration :
BBa_K1155000 : 2 colonies
Primers and PCR :
VF2, VR, Pfnr_up, Pfnr_down are four oligos that we used for plasmid amplification. We used tree combinaisons VF/VR, VF/Pfnr_Down, Pfnr_Up/VR. If the promoter Pndh* insert pSB1C3 plasmid successfully, tree fragments with specific size will be amplified.
Protocol
We resuspend each colony with 20µL of H2O.
Used quantities :
DNA : 2µL
Mix : (it was divided in tubes for 4 different colonies for each oligo combinaison with 23µL of mix in each tube)
VF or Pfnr_Up : 6µL
VR or Pfnr_Down : 6µL
dNTP 10mM : 6µL
Buffer Dream Taq : 30µL
Dream Taq : 6µL
H2O : 246µL
2 - Culture of BBa_K1155000
Sheng
We made new cultures by streaking 2 colonies of 07/02/13 culture of BBa_K1155000. We also did liquid culture of each one.   We incubate culture at 37°C.
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
