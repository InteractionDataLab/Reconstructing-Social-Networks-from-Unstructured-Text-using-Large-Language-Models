Gibson Assembly
Gibson assembly  is a DNA assembly method which allows to join multiple DNA fragments together in a single, isothermal reaction. This method was invented by Daniel Gibson in 2009.
A single-tube Isothermal Assembly reaction features three different enzymatic activities that perform in the same buffer:
The exonuclease creates single-stranded 3´ overhangs that facilitate the annealing of fragments that share complementarity at one end (overlap region).
The proprietary DNA polymerase fills in gaps within each annealed fragment.
The DNA ligase seals nicks in the assembled DNA.
Isothermal Assembly works by combining a cocktail of exouclease, polymerase, an ligase to fuse dsDNA fragments with sufficiently (20-120 bp) homologous ends. It leaves no "scar" behind, i.e. you can expect your product to contain the EXACT over lap sequence. The reaction may work with shorter ends (e.g. 15 bp), so long as the annealing temperature is higher than 50°C.
To perform isothermal assembly:
1. PCR up your fragments of choice, and gel purify. Also gel purify the cut vector
2. Not exceeding a total volume of 5 µL, in a PCR tube, combine fragments at equal molecular ration [e.g. amount fragment 1 = 100 ng * (fragment size 1 / fragment size 2); amount fragment 2 = 100 ng* (fragment size 2 / fragment size 1)... etc.]. If required, bring to 5 µL with ddH2O. We recommend using approximately 100 ng of plasmid backbone.
3. Add the combined fragments (5 µL) to one Isothermal Assembly reaction aliquot (15 µL) and mix by pipetting (20 µL total).
4. Incubate samples in a thermocycler at 50°C for 60 minutes
5. (optional for chem. transformation)Purify with Qiagen PCR purification (MinElute) kit. Elute in 20 µL of ddH2O. [or simply dialyse]
6. The end result is a circular, double-stranded, fully-sealed DNA molecule that can be used to transform into Competent E. coli by using 10 µL of assembly mix
Making Isothermal Assembly Aliquots
5x isothermal assembly reaction buffer (assemble on ice):
From the paper:          Actually added:  3 mL 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5  3 mL 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5  150 uL 2M MgCl2          300 uL 1M MgCl2  60 uL 100 mM dGTP          600 uL 10 mM each dNTP  60 uL 100 mM dCTP     60 uL 100 mM dTTP     60 uL 100 mM dATP     300 uL 1M DTT                  300 uL 1M DTT  1.5 g PEG-8000                 1.5 g PEG-8000  300 uL 100 mM NAD          20 mg NAD  ddH2O to 6 mL                  ddH2O to 6 mL
Prepare 320 uL aliquots (18) and freeze all but one. * Label these “5X isotherm buffer”
To the one remaining (320 uL), add:  1.2 uL  T5 Exonuclease  20 uL   Phusion polymerase (NOT HOTSTART)  160 uL  Taq ligase  700 uL  ddH2O
Prepare 15 uL aliquots (~80) on ice in PCR tubes and store at -20C. These should be good for up to a year.
