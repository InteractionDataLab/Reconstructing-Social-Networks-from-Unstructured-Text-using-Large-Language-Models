Notebook : June 24
Lab work
- Order oligonucleotides and strains
- Research the intergenic sequence which contain the promoter for Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF 707
- Research on Rhodococcus rhodoccrous RHA1
- Research on Registry of standard biological parts
- Search and document about the BioBrick which contain the lacZ with RBS and terminator
- Code: BBa_ I722017. We don’t get it in the kit therefore we could ask to iGEM.
- Design the Pndh* promoter primers called pfrn_ up and pfnr_down for forward and reverse primer, respectively
- List the BioBricks which we may have a need
- Plan the first part manipulation (the first and second BBa)
- Control and verify the construction if we have some BioBrick with RBS and Terminators that could be used after
- General presentation written in Word about PCBs for Wiki
- Prepare 3 ml overnight culture of E.Coli DH5α in LB medium
