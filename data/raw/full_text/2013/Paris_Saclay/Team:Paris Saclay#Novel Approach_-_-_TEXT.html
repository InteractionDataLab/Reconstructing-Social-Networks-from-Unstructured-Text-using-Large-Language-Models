Our Novel Approach : The Damir's PCR
One of the fundamental principles of the iGEM contest is the Open Source. Each iGEM team can take over an old project or a biobrick and improve it, change it to build something new, something better.In this way, our team decided to developp a novel approach, an Open Source approach which each team could use, share and improve : the "Damir's PCR". We have create a PCR's Machine by ourselves, with XX euros ( = XX dollars) and common tools : xx and xx ... The Damir's PCR is the best exemple of the consequences of the Open Source in synthetic biology : everyone can make it and share it. The goal of this novel approach is to share with other teams the Damir's PCR and use it like a basic tool that can be improved.
