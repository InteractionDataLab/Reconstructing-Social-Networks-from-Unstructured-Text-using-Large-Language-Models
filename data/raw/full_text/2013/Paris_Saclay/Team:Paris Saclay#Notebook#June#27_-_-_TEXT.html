Notebook : June 27
Lab work
- Oligonucleotides of Pndh* promoter and plasmid pSB1C3 arrived
- Measure bacterial absorbance  with a spectrophotometer: DO was measured at 10h, with a value of 0.14, agitation continued DO was measured at 15h, with a value of 0.27
- Prepared super competent cells E.Coli DH5αZ1. Aliquot (100µl/tube) and storage them at -70°C
- Search of BioBricks produced by Biejing team in 2008, not available in the registry
- Definition of oligonucleotide for bphR2 in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 and sent an email to Dr. Furukawa for the sequences of primers required for amplification of the region corresponding to GS1 bphR1 gene promoter
- Resuspension of primers with a concentration of 100 µmol/l by water and storage at 4°C
