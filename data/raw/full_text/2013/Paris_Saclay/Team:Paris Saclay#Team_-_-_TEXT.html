1.1 Our Environment
1.2 Students
1.3 Advisors and Instructors
Our Team
This year, the team is composed by students coming from a wide diversity of fields and levels: biologists, chemists, physicists, computer engineers... and from different schools and universities: Paris Sud University, ENS Cachan, IUT ...
Our Environment
We will manipulate this summer at the microbiology and genetic institute IGM at the Paris-Sud University .
Students
Anaïs
First Year of undergraduate in chemistry
"I received a mail about iGEM, I am naturally curious so I went to the first meeting. And I like this concept, it is a amazing experience."
Damir
Second year hardcore master of Physics
"I discovered Synthetic Biology this year through the iGEM. And it's really great !"
Caroline
First year of high-level Master of Molecular Physical Chemistry
"I like the way IGEM gathers strudents from different formations. It is an amazing experience for me."
Eric
First year undergraduate of BCST
"I am passionate about SynBio and sciences. It is interesting to study the practical aplications of SynBio in living"
Zhou
First year of master in bioinformatics and biostatistics
"I love the idea of BioBrick and iGEM, i’m hoping for some pure biological things."
Xavier
First year of high-level Master of Molecular Physical chemistry
"I am passionate about all the fundamental sciences. And I am interested in it."
Abdou Mouthare
Second Year of high-level Master in biology
I adore biology, so iGEM was a perfect opportunity to share my love of biology and to build a strong project"
Sheng
First year of  Master of chemistry
"I love biology and work in a group, it's why I join the team Paris-Saclay."
Xiaojing
First year of Master of Chemistry
"I like science and the way that IGEM offers us to work in a team. It is so cool that we can create new biobricks which are useful."
Nadia
Second year of  pharmacy
"For me IGEM is a great way to create a project which include all scientist fields and biotechnology is the best support for innovation."
Advisors and Instructors
Solenne ITHURBIDE
Second year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie
"I discovered the iGEM competition in 2011 and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I’m very happy to be part of the team as advisor for the second year and I also would like to ensure the existence of this team for the coming years, as it seems essential to me that the University Paris-Saclay is represented in this competition.. Each year is different but the excitation remain the same. We are happy that the Regional Jamboree take place in France this year and we are sure that Lyon have prepared a lot of surprise. I hope this year we will go far in the competition. "
Thao Nguyên LE LAM
Second year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie
"I love biology, Nature and exploring life. Combining biology and technology to create products that can be useful for everybody is wonderful. Synthetic biology is exactly what I was looking for! With the Paris-Saclay team, I hope to be able to create freely, explore and conquer new scientific horizons."
Sylvie LAUTRU, Jean-Luc PERNODET and Philippe BOULOC are CNRS researchers at the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie in the University Paris-Sud. They share a passion for microbiology. Their expertise covers a wide range of organisms, including the model bacterium Escherichia coli, the antibiotics producer Streptomyces and the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Their experimental approaches are both global and mechanistic and their fields of interest are biotechnological and biomedical. They will manage the scientific supervision of the iGEM team Paris-Saclay 2013.
Claire TOFFANO-NIOCHE
Claire Toffano-Nioche is also a CNRS researcher at the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie in the University Paris-Sud. Her research interests lie with deciphering the genome sequence by adding gene annotations. She currently focuses on RNA gene discovery thanks to bioinformatic analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data. She joined the iGEM team Paris-Saclay 2013 just before the summer.
