Notebook : July 12
Lab work
A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
1 -Transformation of BBa_I732019, BBa_B0015, BBa_B0017
Zhou
Transformation of 07/10/13 of BBa_I732019 didn't works. We will do it again.
Protocol : Bacterial transformation
2 -Design of RBS-AmilCP oligos
Abdou, Anaïs
We used software gene manager to find the correct oligopeptides for amplification of RBS-Amil CP.
B - PCB sensor system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155001, BBa_K1155002 and BphR2
1 - Stock of clones 5, 6, 7, 8 for BBa_K1155002, clones 5, 6 for BBa_K1155001 and clones 3, 4 for BphR2
Zhou
Used quantities :
Glycerol 85% : 425
Culture : 1µL
2 - Extraction of clones 5, 6, 7, 8 for BBa_K1155002, clones 5, 6 for BBa_K1155001 and clones 3, 4 for BphR2 from DH5α
Abdou, Sheng
Protocol : High copy plamid extraction
3 - Streak of BBa_K1155002 and BphR2
Anaïs
We streak 25 colonies of 07/10/13 transformation of BphA1 and BphR2 in new solid culture.
