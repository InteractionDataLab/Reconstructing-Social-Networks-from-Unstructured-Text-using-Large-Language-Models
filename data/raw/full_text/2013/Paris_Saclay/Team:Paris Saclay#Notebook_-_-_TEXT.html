Notebook
We constitute our team in November 2012 and we have meeting twice a month until April. Then we met every weeks. The Lab work started at the end of June and stopped at the end of August.
Use our calendar to have a look on our notebook and our filter to go directly to Lab work,Human Practices or Modeling work.
