Notebook : September 14
Human practices
Because synthetic biology touches non scientists and common people too, we have decided to make a poll in Paris durind one afternoon. In this poll we tried to ask specific questions to see if the French are aware of the consequences of the pollution of water and if they agree our project solution: PCBbuster Poll .
We have visited the sewers of Paris in order to understand the water cycle, the way water is cleaning and recycling : Summary of this day .
