PS-PCR : The Paris-Saclay Open Source PCR thermal cycler
Description
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a very useful procedure in the field of synthetic biology. However, this technique requires a device called a thermal cycler, which is designed to cycle the samples through different temperature steps. Commercial PCR thermal cyclers are traditionally very expensive, with prices starting at $2000, which makes them hard to afford for small labs and DIY projects.
This project aims at creating a thermal cycler for under 30€ with easily accessible parts.

Our first prototype
It works !
Scaling and distribution opportunities
This first version of the PS-PCR can be easily manufactured for use by iGEM teams and researchers. By checking the BOM one can deduce that the system is easily scalable.
Moreover, one of our members is currently working with a group to build a highly improved and feature-rich version of this device, which may be available at low cost soon.
Acknowledgements
Thanks to Cyprien and Pierre-Yves for their help with calibration, machining and software. Thanks to the people from the Electrolab hackerspace.
