1.2 Modeling
Notebook : July 17
Lab work
A - Aerobic/Anaerobic regulation system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155003, BBa_K1155007
1 - Electrophoresis  of digestions of BBa_B0015, BBa_B0017, BBa_I732019 by EcoRI/PstI
Anaïs, Sheng
BBa_B0015, BBa_B0017 :
Well 1 : 2µL BBa_B0015+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 2 : 2µL BBa_B0015+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 3 : 2µL BBa_B0015+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 4 : 6µL DNA Ladder
Well 5 : 2µL BBa_B0017+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 6 : 2µL BBa_B0017+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 7 : 2µL BBa_B0017+1µL of 6X loading dye
Gel : 1%
Expected sizes :
BBa_B0015 digested by EcoRI/PstI : 500bp
BBa_B0017 digested by EcoRI/PstI : 500bp
We obtain fragments at the right size. We will do a PCR of them.
Well 1 : 5µL BBa_I732019 digested by EcoRI/PstI+1µL of 6X loading dye
Well 2 : 6µL DNA Ladder
Gel : 1%
Expected sizes :
BBa_I732019 : 3230bp
We didn't obtain fragments at the right size. We will use BBa_I732017.
B - PCB sensor system
Objective : obtaining BBa_K1155001, BBa_K1155002 and BphR2
1 - Stock of BBa_K1155001
Anaïs, Sheng
Used quantities :
BBa_K1155001 confirmed : 1 mL
Glycerol : 500µL glycerol.
We stocked them at -20°C.
2 - Extraction of BBa_K1155001 from DH5α
Anaïs, Sheng
Protocol : Hight copy plamid extraction

Meeting memo
Meeting Date: 17/07/2013
Meeting participants: Patrick Amar, Claire Toffano-Nioche, Abdou Mouhtare, Damir Damipator, Gabriel Gallin, Zhou Yi
Recorder: Zhou Yi
Hsim:
-Hsim is created for bio-chemical reaction simulation, it demonstrates bio-chemical systems which the scientists are already known.
-The molecules are simulated as spheres (in 2D or 3D). Initial positions and size of sphere are configurable.
-example of a Hsim command:
B + V -> R + V [probability]
-Molecules diffusion are simulated by movements of spheres, if the distance between two centers of the spheres is less than the sum of 2 radium, we consider that will lead to a collision.
-Computer takes a random sample and compare it to the probability which is specified in equation. If the value exceeds the threshold, we consider that the reaction takes place.
-Probability of success is associated with kinetics of reaction which depends on concentrations of molecules varying during the reaction.
-Time unit is 100ms. So movement of spheres is discreet.
-Spheres move randomly but could follow some stochastic rules (like Brownian movement).
Ethic about open source:
-Hsim is not an open source software, it belongs to the University of Paris Sud. However, it is a free software, we can download it free.
