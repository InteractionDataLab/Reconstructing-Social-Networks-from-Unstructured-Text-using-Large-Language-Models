Collaboration
During this summer we collaborated with other iGEM teams:
1. We sent a soil sample to the NRP-UEA-Norwich team .
2. We participated to the "Bricks of Knowledge" project of the Copenhagen team : Our video , Copenhague explicative video
3. We met with the Evry team to discuss our respective projects. We met the Evry's team during an afternoon in August. During this meeting, we presented the various aspects of our respective projects : the scientific part, the human practice part and the modeling part. After each presentation we debated, asked questions, and proposed solutions to improve the other team's project. At the end of the day we  had a big 4 o'clock tea.
