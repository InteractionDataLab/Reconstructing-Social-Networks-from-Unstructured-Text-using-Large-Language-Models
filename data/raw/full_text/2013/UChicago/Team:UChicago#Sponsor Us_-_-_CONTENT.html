The University of Chicago had not participated in iGEM since 2009 and we were eager to be the first team in four years. 
</P><P>
As excited as we were to address a pressing industrial and environmental issue, we were at a disadvantage in terms of time. We began recruiting in the spring, but had trouble securing a lab space and funding. Nonetheless, our advisors encouraged us to move forward with the project to gain valuable experience for future years. After a myriad of emails and phone calls, we managed to raise $11, 650 in a matter of weeks. For that we are immensely grateful to student government, the dean’s fund, Dr. Kron, and the Institute of Molecular Engineering. We also were able to secure  generous equipment donations from Greiner Bio One, New England Bio Labs, and Sarstedt. Within a couple of months we had managed to set up a team with funding! 
</P><P>
We had some trouble finding a place to do our benchwork, so we took to doing experiments in our own labs. The Kron Lab was particularly accommodating. With a bit of negotiating, we finally secured lab space in the Biological Sciences Learning Center at the end of June. Our team attended several safety meetings, but the aforementioned time constraints meant the IBC protocol approval process was delayed. With the delayed funding, the delivery of reagents was also delayed. Fortunately, we were lucky to have recruited a tenacious team and as soon as we had the proper reagents and permissions, everybody started working on the project every morning and evening, before and after our normal lab jobs. 
</P><P>
Despite our setbacks in the lab, we have gained experience on how to form a team, acquire funding, secure lab space, and run an organized lab. Armed with newfound experience, we are eagerly anticipating next year’s iGEM competition. In order to have a head start and recruit the best team possible, we will need your help!
