Collaboration
We decided to form a collaboration with Imperial College (Here is a link to their wiki)
They were concerned with waste, especially plastic waste.  One of their projects was using Proteinase K, a peptidase from proteinase K family, to degrade PLA.  Therefore, since our project was creating E. coli that synthesize PLA, the collaboration was perfect.
Our plan is use our extracted PLA from our E. coli, and use the Imperial's teams E. coli to degrade it.
