Introduce type 1 secretion system to export and extract PLA
We needed a way to export the PLA once it was synthesized by the E. coli
We found the paper by Linton 2010 where she focused on exporting PHA from engineered E. coli
Ms. Linton used Phasin, a PHA granule associated protein that plays a role in granule formation, with a hlyA tag.
This allowed the cells to export the PLA since the hlyA tag was attached to the granule
Due to the similarity between PHA granules and PLA granules we hypothesized that this same export system would allow us to export PLA from our cells.
