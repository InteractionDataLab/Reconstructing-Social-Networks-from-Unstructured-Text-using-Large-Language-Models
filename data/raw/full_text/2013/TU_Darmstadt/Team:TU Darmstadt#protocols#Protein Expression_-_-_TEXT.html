Protein Expression
Materials
Equipment
- Incubation shaker
- Photometer
Chemicals & consumables
- E. coli BL21 DE3
- DYT Medium
- IPTG
- 100 ml and 3 l flasks
- ice
Procedure
Inoculation of 50 mL DYT medium in the 100 mL flask with E. coli BL21 DE3 containing pPR-IBA2 plasmid with the sequence for the respective part to be expressed.
Incubation at 180 repulsion per minute (rpm) at 30°C to an OD600= 4
Transferation of the starter culture into 1 L DYT medium in a 3 L flask resulting in an OD600= 0.2
Incubation to an OD600= 0.6 at 180 rpm and 30°C.
Incubation for 15 minutes on ice.
Induction of the proteinexpression with 20 mL of IPTG (stock conentration 1M).
Incubation of the cell suspension over night at 180 rpm at 30°C.
