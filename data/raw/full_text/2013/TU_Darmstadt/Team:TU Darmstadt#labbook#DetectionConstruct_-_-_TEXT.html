Construction of the Detection Construct
The detection construct contains both fusionproteins, tar-LssmOrange and CheB-mKate, which are needed to put the mycotxin mediated FRET system to effect in an bacterial cell. Thus it comprises the following parts.
Traditional cloning approach
We worked on this approach from the 10th of may till the 10th of june. It was abandoned due to major difficulties during restriction, ligation and transformation.
gBLOCK approach
We worked on this approach from the 11th of june till the 12th of august. As before it was abandoned due to major difficulties during restriction, ligation and transformation.
InFusion approach
