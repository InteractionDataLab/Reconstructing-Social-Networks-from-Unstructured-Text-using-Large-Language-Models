Chemically competent cells
Materials
Equipment
- -80°C freezer
- Incubation shaker
- Centrifuge (cooling cababilities required!)
- photometer
- Ice water bath
Chemicals & consumables
- Ice and/or liquid nitrogen
- Falcon tubes
- dYT Medium (50 ml p.c.)
- ice cold 100mM CaCl2
- Glycerin
Procedure
The transformation of E. coli with plasmid DNA via heatshock transformation requires chemically competent cells.
Inoculate 2 mL of LB-Media with an E. coli colony and incubate at 37 °C overnight.
Inoculate 200 mL LB with the preculture.
Incubate at 37°C and 150 rpm until an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 is reached.
Incubate cells on ice for 15 min.
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 10 min (the following steps are carried out on ice).
Resuspend cell pellet in 10mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2 (Do not vortex!).
Incubate on ice for 1 hour.
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 10 min.
Resuspend cell pellet in 10mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2.
Incubate on ice for 1 hour.
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 5 min.
Resuspend cell pellet in 2mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2 and 15 % (v/v) glycerine.
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Aliquot the cells à 100µ.
Store at -80°C.
Mixtures
CaCl2-Solution
