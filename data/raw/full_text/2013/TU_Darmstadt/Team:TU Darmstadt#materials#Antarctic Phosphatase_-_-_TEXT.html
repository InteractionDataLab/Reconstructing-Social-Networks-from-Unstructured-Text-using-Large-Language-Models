Antarctic Phosphatase
About
Antarctic phosphatase catalyzes the removal of 5´ phosphate groups from DNA and RNA. Since phosphatase-treated fragments lack the 5´ phosphoryl termini required by ligases, they cannot self-ligate. This property can be used to decrease the vector background in cloning strategies.[1]
Working conditions
Buffer: 1X Antarctic Phosphatase buffer
