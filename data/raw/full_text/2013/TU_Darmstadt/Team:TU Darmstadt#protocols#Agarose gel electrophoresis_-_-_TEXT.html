Agarose gel electrophoresis
Short explanation
Agarose gel electrophoresis is the most common used method to separate nucleic acids. Due to their negativ charge DNA and RNA molecules can be moved through an agarose gel by an electric field (electrophoresis). Longer molecules move slover through the agarose matrix while short move faster and migrate further.
Procedure
In common we used 1% agarose gel.
1. The hot and liquid agarose gel is mixed with 5µl ROTI-safe for 50ml of agarosegel, alternatively use the same amount of NANCY. (Shake in a bottle)
2. Fill everything in a chamber and let it cool down (do not forget the well combs)
3. Take 1xTAE-Buffer for the run
4. In the first ten minutes run the gel with 80 V and after this select 120V
