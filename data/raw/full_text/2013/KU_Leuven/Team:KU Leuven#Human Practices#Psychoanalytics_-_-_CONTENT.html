He is full professor of Philosophy at the faculty of science of the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In 2012 he published an article in the journal Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy, titled: <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21968838">On decoding and rewriting genomes: a psychoanalytical reading of a scientific revolution.</A> The team members read this article and formulated several questions. <B>During the seminar, the iGEM team and professor Zwart analysed the main thesis and arguments from a philosophical and (exact) scientific viewpoint.</B> The day was concluded with a public lecture by professor Zwart. It was held at the philosophy department of the KU Leuven and was attended by approximately <B>50 philosophers AND scientists.</B> This get-together between scientists and philosophers to discuss synthetic biology from a psychoanalytical viewpoint is a unique collaboration, reflecting one of the key goals of iGEM : bringing people from different backgrounds together to break down the walls between research communities.</P></DIV><DIV class="span6 greytext"><P align="justify">The poster announcing the lecture by Hub Zwart.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="header" class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12"><H3 class="bg-red">Psychoanalytical approach</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><P align="justify">Sigmund Freud founded <B>psychoanalysis</B> at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. As the name suggests it is about the analysis of the (human) psyche. At first it was used as a therapy for patients for which there were no therapeutic options available at that time, in regular medical practice. However, Freud also used it to analyse society, arts and, to a lesser extent, sciences. Later on, the psychoanalysis is further elaborated by Jung, Adler, Lacan, and nowadays by for example Žižek. However, psychoanalysis has been heavily debated since its birth because of its assumed lack of empirical evidence. Here, it is used as a tool to <B>come to terms with synthetic biology as an important component of the current scientific revolution</B>. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><H3>The use of psychoanalytical concepts</H3><P align="justify">Prof. Zwart used the psychoanalytical concepts, <B>“narcissistic insults”</B> and <B>“uneasiness&quot;</B> (<I>Das Unheimliche</I>), to explain what is happening in research laboratories today. He uses these concepts, he tries to make explicit concepts of man, which are employed (most often implicitly) by researchers. We focused on the dynamics of the synthetic biologist in particular. 
Freud writes that every new scientific revolution is accompanied by high expectations. The example Zwart gives is the Human Genome Project. In 2000, President Clinton, together with Francis Collins and Craig Venter, announced their new project. A decade later, Nature devoted a special issues on the results of this project. Although a lot of new techniques became available to sequence DNA, the results were rather disappointing compared to the high expectations. The general public and scientists alike expected to collect much more information, at best to exile cancer. Also the number of protein-coding genes was much lower than expected. The strange observation can be made, that scientists do not become more humble due to the results, but rather, new high expectations arise. They are transferred to alluring substitutes or surrogates.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><H3>Narcissistic insults</H3><P align="justify">A psychoanalytical concept that can help us to understand the dynamics of contemporary life sciences is <B>narcissistic insults</B>. One of the conclusions of the Human Genome Project was that human DNA does not differ so much from other species. On the other hand we consider ourselves as unique within the evolution of life. We believe our intelligence and creativity is unprecedented compared to other species. We consider it justified to employ the toolboxes of Nature for new purposes. Not only biomimesis, but also to improve nature. <B>Uneasiness</B> (<I>Das Unheimliche</I>) is a tendency often seen by the laity. The idea of a monster made in the laboratory is ever-recurring. We often refer to a Frankenstein-scenario, in which the product of our laboratory escapes and becomes uncontrollable. In some cases the horror-scenarios disappear, e.g. IVF. A anthropocentric world view lies beyond these observations. In the end it is mankind who tries to be in charge and control their products. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="header" class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12"><H3 class="bg-red">Conclusion</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><P align="justify">This psychoanalytical reading (in the lecture and seminar with professor Zwart) helped us make <B>the concept of man more explicit</B>. Scientific papers in the field of synthetic biology, the concept of man is most often implicitly present. The psychoanalysis can be used to bridge the gap between philosopher/ethicist on the one hand and scientist/synthetic biologist on the other hand since this approach avoids a third person standpoint. It makes use of a constant dialogue, in which the philosopher/ethicist is not restrictive, but is asking questions out of curiosity and is in constant dialogue with the scientist.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
