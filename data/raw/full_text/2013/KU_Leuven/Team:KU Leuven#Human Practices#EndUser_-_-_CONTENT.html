We went to markets, shops ... in Leuven and its surroundings to determine the general opinion about genetically modified organisms (GMO) and our project. We also took the opportunity to interview some people at the annual farmer’s market in Leuven.

We first introduced our project to him and afterwards we asked him a couple of questions like 'Why did you become an organic farmer?&quot; and &quot;What are your thoughts about our project?&quot;. As part of the bottom up method, we wanted to know his thoughts about our BanAphids and the possible use by organic farmers. He was so kind to let us film the interview.</P></DIV><DIV class="span6"><H3 class="bg-red">The Industry</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span6"><P align="justify">A good reference that your product is viable, is the <B>industry</B>. We visited two different companies to talk about our project and its feasibility. First, we went to <B>Biobest</B>, a worldwide leader in biological pollination and pest management. We presented our project to Prof. Felix Wäckers, the head of R&amp;D. Not only did he give us some excellent advise but he immediately proposed some experiments that we could perform with both ladybugs, aphids and perhaps even other insects at their facilities.
This is what he had to say about our project: <I>&quot;As a world leader in Biological Pest Control, Biobest is looking at innovative tools that can help optimise the efficacy of biological pest control in a range of crops. The use of semiochemicals to either repel pests, or to attract and retain natural enemies is widely seen as a promising strategy that can be well integrated with existing biocontrol programs. The potential of this strategy applies particularly to open field crops, as immigration of natural enemies following their release is a particular bottleneck for the use of biocontrol in the open field. It could help open up significant new markets for Biobest and help reduce the use of pesticides and crop residues. The project uses cutting edge technologies to develop biotic slow release systems. As such, it promises to generate innovative solutions to this timely issue.&quot;</I>
The second company we visited is <B>pcfruit</B>, the co-ordinating organisation for the research and advisory services of fruit growing in Belgium. They too were very excited about our idea and also there we could perform some experiments.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
