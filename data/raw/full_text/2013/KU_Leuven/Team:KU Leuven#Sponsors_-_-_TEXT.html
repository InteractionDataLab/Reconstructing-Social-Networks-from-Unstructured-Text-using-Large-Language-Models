Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

BioSCENTer
The Leuven Centre for Bio-Science, Bio-Engineering and Bio-Technology (BioSCENTer) is one of the largest research centres of the Group Science, Engineering and Technology of KU Leuven. It emerged in 2008 when four different research clusters, bioinformatics and systems biology, virtual life, Biomolecular interaction (Biomint), and evolutionary biology (iCEB) decided to join their efforts. Its aim is to integrate the available expertise on fundamental and applied Life Sciences; to stimulate cross-disciplinary fertilisation; to boost excellence in research, teaching and training; to create an inspiring environment for innovative ideas on scientific and societal challenges; and to advise decision makers in policy and strategic initiatives.
