Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

08/07 – 12/07
Week 2: Getting started
We started investigation of literature of ecology. We chose our model species. We’ll try to model aphid reproduction and the influence of β-farnesene and methylsalicylate on life cycle and movement. We’ll also have to make an estimation of the damage/loss of crops due to a certain population of aphids. Tomas was finally able to solve the 2D PDE in Matlab wich he later refined, and he set boundary conditions for the diffusion. A more realistic model for the wind speed was used.
29/07 – 12/07
Week 5: We missed Tomas!
Tomas, the man behind our ecological model has been on holiday. Now he's back and ready to finetune his diffusion model. He got us an account to the HPC cluster and 1000 credits. Seems like waiting for a MATLAB job to be done is something from the past!
Besides that, he also started writing text for the wiki and helped Bert in the analysis of his oscillator model.
19/08 – 23/08
Week 8: Installing COMSOL
We installed COMSOL to do some simulations. This software seems to be working great for our ecological model.
