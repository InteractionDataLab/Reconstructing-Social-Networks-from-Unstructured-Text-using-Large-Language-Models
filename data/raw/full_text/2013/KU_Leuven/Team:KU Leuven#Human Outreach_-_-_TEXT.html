Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Outreach
Synthetic biology isn’t well-known to the general public and we would like to increase awareness concerning its applications and safety. We decided to work on different areas. We organized a symposium, gave workshops in secondary schools, and went to farmers to talk about the project and about synthetic biology in general. We also sent press texts to publicise both synthetic biology and iGEM.
Education
Ensuring the future of science.
Seminars
Lectures for the general public.
Press
We were in the news!
