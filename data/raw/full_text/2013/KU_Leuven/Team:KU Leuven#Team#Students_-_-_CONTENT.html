It’s a very diverse team consisting of students with different backgrounds. There are 10 guys and 6 girls present with studies in biochemistry, (bio-)engineering, medicine, philosophy and others. The team is supported by former iGEMers and employees from all levels of the KU Leuven.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item left"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Aurelie Lenaerts</H3><H5>Biomedical sciences - Sponsoring &amp; Wiki</H5><P align="justify">Hell’s to the no if it isn’t Aurelie hopping up and down the stairs to get things done. This energetic member of our team will help with anything as long as it’s not taking care of insects. Between seducing sponsors and sparking the interest of young students for synthetic biology she almost made us walk 100 kilometers just to sponsor our iGEM adventure.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item right"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Bert Mortier</H3><H5>Chemical Engineering - Modelling &amp; Human Practices</H5><P align="justify">Bert is one tough critic!

Luckily then, that he is on the Ethics team so that synthetic biology cannot slip by without being inspected in every way possible. Bert is a chemical engineer who is fascinated by biochemistry and microbial life.

Flore is studying a Master of Biochemistry and Biotechnology. When she is not busy finding sponsors for the team, she will be busy in the lab and when she has tackled that, you could find her helping the education team out or doing a literature study. On top of that, Flore finds the time to enjoy running, travelling and baking!

Other hobbies are bragging about the fact that he lives in the same city (read: village) as cyclist Tom Boonen, taking his Gene Technology exam for yet another time and working on our wiki since he loves informatics as well. Actually, in retrospect, we don’t  really know why we hang out with him. Oh yeah, probably because he has the most contagious laugh ever known to mankind and he’s a really nice guy to be around.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item left"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Laurens De Backer</H3><H5>Biochemistry &amp; Biotechnology - Wetlab</H5><P align="justify">This guitar playing rock star is, yes you guessed it, also a Master student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology! Laurens likes to keep us entertained by singing and dancing iGEM medley versions of classics (if you would like to see him in action, join us on facebook or youtube for video uploads!) and in his spare time he likes to come to the lab and help out by singing to some pipets instead. Besides the common Belgian hobby of beer drinking, Laurens is also very interested in signal transduction and cell regulation.

Coordinating the wetlab and discussing (especially ethics) is one of his top favourite occupations this summer. Next to iGEM, this future doctor  is also vice-president of the Leuven student-researchers association (LVSO). Next to his 24h science job, he also likes to have fun with his friends and enjoys sausages at the BBQ, combined with some booze. In September, he is planning to go scouting in the Amazon forest.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item left"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Michael Poorthuis</H3><H5>Philosophy - Human Practices</H5><P align="justify">  Michael Poorthuis is graduate student in philosophy at the KU Leuven and graduate student in medicine at Utrecht University.

If this student Bio-engineering (Cell and gene technology) is not busy in the wetlab cloning 20 different genes at once, he’s probably sitting quiet in a corner in the iGEM room, making some new memes. When Pieter’s around, you always feel at ease. He is fan of rock music, a good movie and a cooled beer. Combine the last with any of the first two and he’s good to go.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item left"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Robbert Boudewijns</H3><H5>Biochemistry &amp; Biotechnology - Outreach &amp; Wetlab</H5><P align="justify">Meet Robbert, he will be your guide to the internet.

Being busy during summers as student-researcher, she still enjoys playing the bassoon in her spare time. Now, she’s keeping herself busy with giving presentations in secondary schools. With her drawing skills, she was even able to create a 3D model of our bacterium, which is now being used during the workshops in schools.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item right"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Sander Wuyts</H3><H5>Bio-engineering - Modelling &amp; Logistics</H5><P align="justify">This blonde, confident guy is Sander, also known as Sandieboy. Currently, he is pursuing his Masters degree in Bioscience Engineering: Cell and Gene technology, and he has a big interest in bio-informatics. Whenever he is not reading one article for three days, he is busy with modelling, and trying to create more efficient, dependent feedback mechanisms and interactions between the wetlab and the modelling teams. Sander has a really big temper, but in the weekends he dances all his troubles away, on events like Tomorrowland.

Thanks to her female influence, all male modellers are doomed to follow a strict time schedule. When she’s not roaming the world of synthetic biology, she often goes swimming or is busy reading books. Interestingly, she has an incomprehensible affection for insects –even loves to eat them as well- and loves to go to metal festivals –completely dressed up.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item right"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Tomas Van Pottelbergh</H3><H5>Electrical Engineering - Modelling</H5><P align="justify">Tomas was raised in Geetbets, but came to the big city of Leuven to study Electrical Engineering, minoring in Living Systems.

Interdisciplinary studies were performed combining bacterial genetics and immunology. He always had and still has a profound interest in scientific research, especially linking applied microbiology, mucosal immunology and health issues.

Leuven is her hometown but she went abroad to obtain her PhD in genetics and biochemistry from the University of Vienna (Austria). While doing a postdoc in Canada, she came in contact with iGEM via the Calgary team of 2011, 2012. She was sold immediately and, upon her return to Leuven, more than happy to support the KU Leuven team.
Her research interests lie with signal transduction; particularly in response to environmental changes. Currently she is working as a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Prof. Dr. Mathieu Bollen (<A href="http://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/research/50000618">Dept of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</A>) on protein phosphatases and their roles as master metabolic regulators in health and disease.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white team-item left"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span9"><H3>Johan Robben</H3><H5>Professor</H5><P align="justify">Professor Dr. Johan Robben is a member of the Department of Chemistry, <A href="http://chem.kuleuven.be/en/research/bmsb/index.html">section Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology</A>  at the KU Leuven.
