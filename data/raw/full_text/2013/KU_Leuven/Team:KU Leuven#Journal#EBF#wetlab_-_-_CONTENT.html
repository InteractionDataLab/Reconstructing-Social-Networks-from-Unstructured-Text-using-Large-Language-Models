Now we do have cell growth, so we counted the cells and calculated the transformation efficiency. This was still quite low though...
We prepared the GTE-buffer for future use and prepared agar medium. Later, we found out that the medium in the autoclave spilled out everywhere in the autoclave, possibly due to the pressure. Lukas was the lucky guy who got to clean out the autoclave.
The parts from iGEM have arrived!

Interestingly, the ones where we used 50µl of cells to plate instead of 20µl, were most successful. This means that the lack of colonies may be caused by a too low amount of cells put on the petri dishes. This in turn also suggests that the transforming efficiency is quite low. We repeated the transformation with 50µl or even more cells for the unsuccessfully transformed biobricks. Later we also performed the plasmid extraction on all the successfully transformed biobricks.
We wanted to do a colony PCR on <I>Streptomyces coelicor</I>, so first we prepared the primer stocks for that. <I>Streptomyces</I> have a gene coding for EBF synthase. This enzyme produces EBF out of farnesyl diphosphate.

The rest of the digested DNA we stored at -20°C after denaturing the enzyme by putting it at 80 °C for 20min.
After visualizing the gel with EtBr, we could only observe the bands of the backbone (and some other bands that we didn’t know where they come from), the band of the parts we want could not be seen. The possible reason could be that these parts are too small (they are promoters, RBS, etc, with a size rangeing from 12 to 72bp), hence the EtBr cannot bind them in a sufficient amount and therefore we could not see them. This is why we will need another strategy to tackle the problem of assembly.
We transformed Inoue competent cells with 4F3, 5D3, 23L5 (an alternative for double terminator), 5E1 and EBF. All these transformations were successful!

We ran a gel for D1,1 and D1,2 to confirm we have the EBF synthase gene. Then we ligated 5E1 + EBF (=D1)+ pSB1K3 (the standard iGEM backbone).  We incubated it at room temperature overnight.
We ran a gel for these, but the results were not exactly cheering. We only got 1 band from the digested EBF device D1, the possible reason could be that the backbones ligated to eachother to form a bigger plasmid, instead of inserting the EBF into the plasmid. Since we only took 2 colonies, these results are possible.

We did a colony PCR for 10 randomly selected D1 colonies and ran the gel to confirm they have D1 plasmid. The results are weird however, we only got a band with a short length of DNA. A possible reason could be that the anealing temp for the primer was a little low so that the primer anealed unspecifically, which lead to the short secquence products.
Therefore we randomly selected 17 more colonies, plus 10 colonies from yesterday, and performed another round of colony PCR. The nanodrop results for these colony PCR are really high, meaning that the PCR worked. We later ran the gel, but the results were again not pleasant. It's very possible that the ligation (or even digestion) was not good.
We transformed D2 and D3 (D2 is promoter 3O1 in front of EBF, D3 is promoter 5E1 in front of EBF) into inoue cells. This wass unsuccessful so we tried again with electroporation. We transformed D2 and D3 by electroporation and plated out the transformed cells on Kan plates. The tranformation was again not successful, so we tried again with a higher DNA concentration.
The EBF-plasmid finally arrived. This plasmid is the (E)-beta-farnesene synthase from Artemisia Annua in the pET28 backbone. The plasmid was on filter paper, so we used an elution buffer to retrieve it. We transformed the EBF plasmid to competent cells from the mutagenesis kit (with this kit we want to mutate a specific site in the EBFaa pET28 plasmid)) using electroporation and plated them out on Kan plates. This transformation was successful.
We started our new strategy for digestion and ligation:

The gel only has bands around 500bp, the possible reason may be that the primers can aneal to genomic DNA, so we decided to inoculate the transformed cells, do a miniprep, then digest and run the gel to see if there are any correct bands.

We also tried another aphid experiment with the gEBFaa5 construct. This time we connected two empty leaves which were on EBF-producing bacterium plate and control plate with the leaf in the middle, therefore the aphids can move onto the other leaves. There’s no significant difference of the amount of aphids on the two leaves. This may due to the in this construct, there was lac operator after the promoter, the lacI in the bacteria may interfere the production of EBF.
In addition, we also tried the aphids without leaf. We put 30 aphids in the middle, and on the left side sat a leaf with 10micro liter of EBF-producing bacteria and on the right side a normal leaf. After 2 hours we counted the number of aphids on the leaf, there were 4 aphids on the leaf where the EBF concentration should be higher and 6 aphids on the control leaf, the rest of aphids just walked randomly in the big petri dish.

Right after the regional jamboree, we immediately started more quantitative characterizations for our EBF and MeS producing bricks. 
In the case of EBF synthase producing brick, we redid the <I>in vivo</I> test with aphids. It was conducted with 3 biological repeats for both control (BL21 wild type) and the brick (BBa_K1060009). We selected sweet pepper leaves with similar size infested with aphids, put them in big glass container with sufficient natural ventilation. The EBF producing bacteria and the control strain were only introduced one hour later when the aphids were settled down on the leaves. Subsequently, we counted the amount of aphids that stayed on top of the leaves as well as the number of aphids that was moving every half an hour. <B>We observed a trend of more aphids scattering away from the leave in the EBF compared to the control setup. A statistical difference was observed in the percentage of aphids moving in the EBF compared to the controle group.</B>
We retried the <B>SDS-PAGE</B> for EBF brick, this time we compared control strain, DH5alpha + BBa_K1060009 and BL21 + BBa_K1060003. As a result, we observed an extra band in the pattern of the EBF producing strains, in combination with our growth curve, we think that the reason of slow growth in the transformed DH5alpha strain may due to the activity of EBF synthase. For more details please visit our project page. 
Moreover, we performed gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy (<B>GC-MS</B>) for both BBa_K1060009 and BBa_K1060003. In the situation of EBF, we could not detect the presence of it, this may due to either the extraction step is not completely right, or the amount of EBF produced was too low to be detected, or EBF was evaporated during the shaking cultivation. However, in the case of MeS, we detected it if we add Sodium Salicylate as supplement. </P></DIV></DIV></LI><DIV class="printfooter">
