To answer this question we performed a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) which can be found <A href="https://2013.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:KU_Leuven/Project/Glucosemodel/MeS/Modelling-FBA">here</A>.

Another important question could be: How much methyl salycilate (MeS) will be produced in the end? This question can be answered using the Kinetic Parameter Model, described on this page. By modelling the pathway leading to MeS we can get a good estimation of the average MeS production. Apart from that we can also take a closer look at the pathway and find the rate limiting steps. We can use this information to fine tune the MeS production the way we want it.

At first, our intention was to model the entire pathway from the implemented DNA sequence to the resulting production rate. This could be very useful to approximate the resulting production rate and to figure out the rate-limiting step. To achieve this we need a mathematical representation of all the relevant biological processes, including transcription rate, mRNA degradation rate, translation rate, protein degradation rate and enzyme kinetics.

We created a set of <B>ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent every step in our pathway</B>: transcription, translation and the chemical activity of the protein.

The proteins <B>pyochelin A (PchA) and pyochelin B (PchB) are extracted from the pchDCBA operon</B>and are the structural proteins responsible for salicylate biosynthesis. Serion <I>et al.</I> (1995) describes that the expression of the <I>pchA</I> gene appears to depend on the transcription and translation of the upstream <I>pchB</I> gene in <I>P. aeruginosa</I>. They also state <I>“Salicylate formation was demonstrated in an </I>Escherichia coli entC<I> mutant lacking isochorismate synthase when this strain expressed both </I>pchBA<I> genes, but not when it expressed </I>pchB<I> alone”</I>. This is also confirmed by Gaille, Reimman and Haas (2003): <I>“The </I>pchA<I> gene is strictly co-expressed with the upstream </I>pchB<I> gene; without </I>pchB<I> being present in cis no expression of </I>pchA<I> can be observed”</I>. Finally Serion <I>et al.</I> (1995) reports that the <I>pchB</I> stop codon overlaps the presumed <I>pchA</I> start codon. 
Therefore we conclude that <B>transcription and translation of <I>pchA</I> and <I>pchB</I> is coupled and we decided to use only one gene (pchBAgene), and only one mRNA molecule (mpchbA) for both proteins (PchA and PchB) in our model</B>.

First we determine the number of genes transcribed in our model. We start with 2 genes (<I>pchBA</I> operon and <I>bsmt1</I>).

</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><H3>Transcription:</H3><P align="justify"> 
An extensive literature survey revealed that it is difficult to predict transcription rate, particularly combined with the proper promoter dependence. It is even near impossible without good wet-lab data.
A recent review by Shiue and Prather (2012) describes this problem in the following way: “<I>due to the large sequence space and relative lack of understanding regarding polymerase-promoter interactions, the development of such predictive models remains a daunting task</I>”. Also recent discussions on stochastic gene expression suggest that reliable, quantitative predictions of mRNA production are a daunting task.

In the past, many iGEM teams predicted their transcription rate using a formula introduced by <A href="https://2008.igem.org/Team:NTU-Singapore/Modelling/Parameter">NTU-Singapore in 2008</A>:</P><P align="justify">
We fear that this formula is not a proper representation of transcription rate for a number of reasons :</P><OL><LI>The reference claiming an average transcription speed of 70 nt/s is no longer available.

In our case, we observed most uncertainty in the transition from transcription to mRNA production. As an alternative to the modelled mRNA production step, we tried to determine <I>in vivo</I> mRNA concentrations using qPCR. This means that we will drop formulas [1.A] and [1.B]. If you want to know more on how we tackled the qPCR, please go to our <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Project/qPCR">WETLAB part</A>. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><H3>Translation:</H3><P align="justify"> 
Initiation is usually the most important rate-determining step of the translation process (McCarthy and Gualerzi, 1990). Combined with the fact that there is a negligible chance for premature disassembly of the ribosome and mRNA, <B> only the rate of translation initiation has to be known to determine the rate of translation </B>.

The initiation codon, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the identity of the base at position -3 and the occurrence of alternative ATGs (that do not serve as an initiation codon) are features known to be important for translation initiation (Barrick <I>et al.</I>, 1994). When those are known it should be possible to make an estimation of the translation rate.

Pennsylvania State University was able to quantify the different relevant features and created a tool (Salis <I>et al.</I>, 2009) (Salis, 2011) that predicts the translation rate when the mRNA sequence is known. Even within a range of five orders of magnitude the tool should not differ from the reality with a factor higher than 2.3 (Salis  <I>et al.</I>, 2009). The RBS determines the translation initiation rate, however, this is relative to all other translated coding sequences (Salis, 2011). Since the RBS calculator uses the same scale for every calculation, the relative translation initiation rate of each protein can thus be determined. An absolute translation initiation rate for only one gene suffices to extract absolute rates. To model this properly, we would require a translation initiation rate of one of the genes from our construct. At this moment, these values are not available from the wetlab, but values from literature should give a reasonable result. We have found that the initiation rate of translation for the <I>lacZ</I> gene in the <I>lac</I> operon is approximately 0.31 initiations per second per mRNA copy (Kennell and Riezman, 1977), which we consequently used as a standard. 

A first run through the tool yielded adequate results for both PchB and BSMT1, however the output for PchA was unrealistically low. We realised the RBS for PchA was part of PchB, causing the low output. After communication with dr. Salis himself we settle on a different tool from his website, especially designed for operon structures. 
This was indeed the appropriate tool to quantify the translation initiation of the operon pchBA : the output now showed a satisfactory translation rate for each of the proteins in <I>E. coli</I>. We obtained results for the lac operon (as a control) and for the genes we want to clone into <I>E. coli</I> (<A href="https://salis.psu.edu/software/">https://salis.psu.edu/software/</A>). They are listed in Table 1. The third column of this table shows the values of the translation initiation rate that are computed using the literature value from the lac operon.</P><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TH><B>Gene</B></TH><TH><B>Translation initiation rate according to the RBS calculator (a.u.)</B></TH><TH><B>Translation initiation rate (initiations/(s.mRNA))</B></TH></TR><TR><TD><I>lacZ</I></TD><TD>20579,19</TD><TD>0,3125</TD></TR><TR><TD><I>bsmt1</I></TD><TD>5587,09</TD><TD>0,085</TD></TR><TR><TD><I>pchB</I></TD><TD>19288,23</TD><TD>0,293</TD></TR><TR><TD><I>pchA </I></TD><TD>326970,82</TD><TD>4,965</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><I>Table 1. Translation rates, as computed with the Penn State University RBS calculator, using the MIT 2006 BioBrick (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J45700">BBa_J45700</A>)</I>.
<P align="justify"> When MIT produced their MeS brick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J45700">BBa_J45700</A> in 2006, it was meant to convert salicylate to methylsalicylate and produce a wintergreen scent in the process. However, the scent could only be detected when salicylate was added to the medium, proving that the BSMT1 equation functions yet the PchA and PchB equations may not function. Initially, it was thought that the RBS problems discussed above could be the cause but we could show this is most likely not the case : we entered the MIT brick sequence in the operon specific tool and obtained satisfactory data. Thus, at least <I>in silico</I> the pchBA operon could function, suggesting the lack of salicylate is caused by a different reason. For further elaboration on this topic we refer you to the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Project/MeSa/wetlab">methyl salicylate wetlab page</A>.  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span12 white"><H3>Protein degradation:</H3><P align="justify"> 
The perceived degradation rate results not only from the breakdown of proteins, but also from the dilution due to cell growth. Every cell cycle the proteins are divided amongst the two resulting cells and the amount is thus effectively divided by two. We will look into both to conclude which effect dominates and what ranges are possible.

The breakdown part of the degradation of proteins is highly dependent on the presence of a degradation signal, called degron. These degrons could be hidden in a folded protein and could become exposed for example after a stress reaction (Dougan <I>et al.</I>, 2010). One of the most characterized and important degrons is called the N-degron, which is a destabilizing N-terminal residue. With this information, the laboratory of Varshavsky has created the N-end rule, which relates the <I>in vivo</I> half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (Varshavsky, 1997).
The N-end rule is applicable to a wide range of organisms ranging from <I>E. coli</I> to plants and mammals (Dougan <I>et al.</I>, 2010). Of course we are interested in the <I>E. coli</I> N-end rule, described by Tobias <I>et al.</I> (1991) and Shrader <I>et al.</I> (1993). This N-end rule states that if the N-terminal residue is arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan, the protein will have a half-life of only 2 minutes. These amino acids are called primary destabilizing residues. On the other hand, amino terminal arginine and lysine are secondary destabilizing residues in <I>E. coli</I>. These residues conjugate to primary destabilizing residues, which again results in a half-life of only 2 minutes (Tobias <I>et al.</I>, 1991). 
If the N-terminal residue is neither a primary nor a secondary destabilizing residue, the half-life of the proteins exceeds 10 hours. We applied this rule to the proteins of our interest, with the results displayed in Table 2.

Therefore we will take this generation time as a value for our “protein degradation”. On the <A href="http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?&amp;id=101790&amp;ver=7&amp;trm=generation%20coli"> Bionumbers website</A>, we found that a good rule of thumb for this generation time is around 3000s, which is 50 min.

More about this qPCR story can be read <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Project/qPCR">here</A>.
These amounts were meant to reduce the uncertainty in the model. Rather than running our model with unrealistic values (eg. the transcription rate formula described in section 1) and add uncertainty to the data, we opted to not use this model at this point.
