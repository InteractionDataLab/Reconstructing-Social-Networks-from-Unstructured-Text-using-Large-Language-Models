Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Top-down
As the impact of synthetic biology is exponentially increasing and our project being part of that, we examined the implication of our project for the security, safety and environment. We did this by means of a normative approach in which we evaluated our project against the background of the literature on biosafety, biosecurity and justice and synthetic biology. This normative approach is prescriptive in the sense that it prescribes how one ought to act. The work of the philosopher Hans Jonas can also be considered as an exponent of top-down structure.
