Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Team
On this team page you can find the students and advisors of the team. They all worked really hard on E.coligy: plants with BanAphids! Of course, we could only do this because off all the help we got from a lot of different people. We thanked them under 'attributions'. If you are being helped, you should also help. This is why we started some collaborations with other teams, including a very first, very small gathering of the Benelux iGEM teams. More about this can be found under collaborations.
