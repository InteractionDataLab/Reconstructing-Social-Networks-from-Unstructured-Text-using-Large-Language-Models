Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

Collaborations
INSA Toulouse
Already in mid-June INSA Toulouse asked us to send a brick. From our own experience, we knew that ordering bricks from the registry could take some time. Therefore we helped out the team of INSA Toulouse by sending them the brick BBa_K145150 from the KU Leuven team of 2008.
Purdue
The 2013 Purdue iGEM team started a project to bring a new standard to the datasheets. We gladly participated as we also consider this a serious problem. After filling out their first survey and giving suggestion for the datasheets, we filled in their Doodle and participated in their video conference. Next, we helped them out by filling in their second survey and making some more suggestions for their standardised datasheets.
Eindhoven
The 2013 TU-Eindhoven iGEM team started their "synthetic facts" project . With this they want to bring the world of synthetic biology closer to everyone (scientist & non-scientist) in a correct manner. They provide facts that are thoroughly analysed by different teams and given a final statement noting that the fact is either true, false or undecided. We were happy to contribute some of our time to checking a fact and got this nice medal for it!
BeNe(Lux) – UGent & Groningen
In the beginning of July, the idea of organising a debate attracted us. After consulting multiple people (Professors, PhD students,…), we found out that everyone noticed the need for such a debate. Furthermore, they advised us to give the general academic public an introduction on synthetic biology and iGEM. The idea was therefore extended to a symposium followed by a debate. We invited all teams of the BeNe(Lux), from which the team of UGent and Groningen responded positively. After introductory seminars by Prof. J. Robben and Prof. K. Verstrepen, and our own project presentation, we were pleased to welcome the team of Groningen. After a five hour drive they still kept their enthusiasm for the Symposium. After some ‘Belgian’ fries we were ready for the debate. The end of the day was closed with a reception where the people could further debate.
