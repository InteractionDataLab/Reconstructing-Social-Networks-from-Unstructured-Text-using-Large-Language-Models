Since this brick has got two antibiotic resistance genes (kanamycin and ampicillin), we plated them out on kanamycin plates and ampicillin plates.
Using the cells containing Bba_J45700, some of our team members did a smell test, to see whether the production of methylsalicylate was significant, since methylsalicylate has a wintergreen scent. Plate C was the one containing these cells. These are the results, “-“ meaning no difference in scent compared to the control, “+” meaning a difference in scent compared to the control. As can be seen, plate C is chosen only a few times. The brick might need some improvement, for example by using stronger promoters and ribosome binding sites. So we will reconstruct Bba_J45700 by taking out the useful pieces and putting them back together with other parts.</P><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TH>Name</TH><TH>plate A</TH><TH>plate B</TH><TH>plate C</TH></TR><TR><TD>Ingmar</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>Su</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>Sander</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>Bert</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>Frederik</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>+</TD></TR><TR><TD>Saar</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>+</TD></TR><TR><TD>Robbert</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>-</TD></TR><TR><TD>Sabine</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD><TD>+</TD></TR><TR><TD>Flore</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>+</TD><TD>-</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P align="justify">In order to get <I>pchBA</I> and <I>bsmt1</I> out of the original brick, a PCR on <I>pchBA</I> and <I>bsmt1</I> is done.

The transformation was repeated.
To improve the production of methylsalicylate, we wanted to improve the production of chorismate, a precursor of methylsalicylate. The product of <I>aroG</I> is an important enzyme in the production of chorismate. We first wanted to isolate this <I>aroG</I>, and then mutate it to make it insensitive to negative feedback from phenylalanine.
We did a colony PCR on 4 random DH5α, to amplify <I>aroG</I>. 
Fragments were all around 1000 bp, as expected.

Unfortunately, only the <I>aroG</I> band had the right length. For the other two genes, only very small fragments were visible. We inoculated the <I>aroG</I> containing cells.
For the mutagenesis of <I>aroG</I>, we performed a mutagenesis PCR with primers with a point mutation in them. After this, we did a KLD treatment (kinase, ligase, <I>Dpn</I>I) + transformation.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>29/07 – 02/08</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><H3>Week 5: Everything fails!</H3><DIV class="content"><P align="justify">Mutagenesis didn’t work since there was no PCR product to be seen on a gel.

This megaprimer was made with a regular primer, starting from the biobrick suffix, and a primer containing a point mutation. 
In order to get rid of the primers that were used in the PCR reaction of this megaprimer, we put the product on a gel containing crystal violet. The purified megaprimer was used in a PCR reaction with the <I>aroG</I> containing plasmid, in order to mutate it.<TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>35µl</TD><TD>H2O</TD></TR><TR><TD>10µl</TD><TD>buffer</TD></TR><TR><TD>0.5µl</TD><TD>dNTP</TD></TR><TR><TD>2µl</TD><TD>megaprimer</TD></TR><TR><TD>1.5µl</TD><TD><I>aroG</I> plasmid</TD></TR><TR><TD>1µl</TD><TD>Phire polymerase</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

For the mutagenesis of <I>aroG</I>, we ran a PCR reaction without polymerase, to have a comparison on the gel.
No bands were visible for either the positive and the negative mutagenesis PCR reaction. However, it is possible that a cluster of annealed plasmids didn't move into the gel, since there is a high signal in the well. Luckily, Misha told us, <I>E.coli</I> is capable of untangling this, so a transformation might still work.
We also put the methylsalicylate producing brick into a new backbone, pSB1C3.
In order to reconstruct the methylsalicylate brick for higher production, we also transformed the bricks 13B5 and 1M3, respectively pTetR+RBS and the lacI coding sequence on ampicillin and chloramphenicol plates, respectively.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI><TIME class="cbp_tmtime"><SPAN>12/08 – 16/08</SPAN></TIME><DIV class="cbp_tmlabel"><H3>Week 7: Megaprimer</H3><DIV class="content"><P align="justify">We started the construction of new biobricks:</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI>pTetR + strong RBS</LI><LI>lacI + strong RBS</LI><LI>strong RBS + MIT 2006 brick</LI>

Unfortunately, after extracting these plasmids and cutting them with EcoRI and PstI, we didn’t see the expected bands. 
We repeated the digestions and ligations of the previous constructs, but without succes.
This week, we started working on designing the gBlocks we were going to order. For the construct with pTetR-RBS-<I>lacI</I>-RBS-<I>aroGM</I>-TT we used 4 gBlocks, for the improvement of Bba-J45700, we used just one that contained a ptetR sequence in stead of a lac-promoter that would be affected by the lac repressor. The rest of the brick (the two parts to the side of this gBlock) was made with PCR of the original brick.

With the extracted proteins, we ran the SDS-PAGE.

Afterwards, we prepared 68 epps to perform a double blind smell test of our methyl salicylate brick (BBa_K1060003) and the methyl salicylate brick from MIT 2006 (BBa_J45700). In this experiment 4 sets were used with termperature and incubation time as variables. The first set was conducted at room temperature for 24 hours, the second set was incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours, the third was incubated in 37ºC for 8 hours, the last one was carried out at room temperature for 8 hours. In each set, we inoculated our brick BBa_K1060003 with IPTG, IPTG + salicylate (concentration ranges from 0.01mM to 1mM), and IPTG + chorismate (concentration ranges from 0.01mM to 1mM), the same was done for the MIT 2006 brick BBa_J45700. These combinations of additives were also introduced in parallel for a negative control (non-MS producing E.Coli).
We had 11 people participating in the blind test. After the test we calculated the percentage of people who smelled MS. Based on the percentage, we can conclude that the smell was stronger after 24 hours incubation time compared to 8 hours. Incubating the bacteria in 37 degrees enhanced the production compared to incubation at room temperature. Another effect is a more obvious smell in the epps where 0.1mM or 1mM salicylate was added. In addition, the effect of adding chorismate became clearer after 24 hours. The reason why chorismate requires more time to see the effect may lie in the fact that chorismate is the very first precursor of the methyl salicylate production pathway, whereas salyciate is a precursor one step before methyl salicylate. Most importantly we can conclude that our brick worked in terms of producing methyl salicylate.
