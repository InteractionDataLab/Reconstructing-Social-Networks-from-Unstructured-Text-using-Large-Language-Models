Secret garden
Congratulations! You've found our secret garden! Follow the instructions below and win a great prize at the World jamboree!
A video shows that two of our team members are having great fun at our favourite company. Do you know the name of the second member that appears in the video?
For one of our models we had to do very extensive computations. To prevent our own computers from overheating and to keep the temperature in our iGEM room at a normal level, we used a supercomputer. Which centre maintains this supercomputer? (Dutch abbreviation)
We organised a symposium with a debate, some seminars and 2 iGEM project presentations. An iGEM team came all the way from the Netherlands to present their project. What is the name of their city?
Now put all of these in this URL:https://2013.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/(firstname)(abbreviation)(city), (loose the brackets and put everything in lowercase) and follow the very last instruction to get your special jamboree prize!

New additional approach: Bottom-up or ethics from within!
The top-down structure sometimes fails because scientist get the feeling that they do not get the proper recognition and they feel restricted by laws and regulations. Therefore a philosophy student joined the KU Leuven  iGEM team to develop a new approach for human practices. This unique collaboration resulted in an extensive approach.
The different parts of this approach are:
The blog: We wrote a blog to give regular scientists a better understanding of ethics.
Psychoanalysis: Here used as a tool to come to terms with synthetic biology as an important component of the current scientific revolution.
Interviews: All team members and their supervisors were interviewed to get a better understanding of their ethical beliefs with regard to synthetic biology and our project.
