Keith Kozminski, PhD - Team Advisor
Associate Professor of Biology, University of Virginia
As advisor of all things iGEM-related, Prof. Kozminski proved an invaluable source of information and aid at all hours of the day and night. We are eternally grateful for his support, and can only hope that a trip to Canada and a copious supply of banana bread demonstrate our appreciation.
Inchan Kwon, PhD - Team Advisor
Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering, University of Virginia
As a source of consistent support through regular meetings and project discussions, we greatly appreciate Prof. Kwon’s work as an advisor.
Jason Papin, PhD - Team Advisor
Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia
As a source of invaluable computer modeling knowledge, we are truly thankful for Prof. Papin as an advisor.  We appreciate his direction in both project development and analysis.
Matthew Giacalone, PhD - Minicell Formation
Vice President of Corporate Development and Research at Vaxiion Therapeutics
Dr. Giacalone guided our minicell formation and characterization teams with recommendations regarding FtsZ upregulation and IPTG induction.
Alison Criss, PhD - BioSafety and Protocol Development
Assistant Professor of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia
Providing truly invaluable support and encouragement, Dr. Criss guided our project’s development as we first investigated minicells. As our research progressed, her advice regarding protocol development and her insight into bioethical considerations proved essential, and we are truly grateful for her support.
Vinod Jyothikumar, PhD - Imaging and Modeling
Keck Center for Cellular Imaging (KCCI)
With incredible knowledge regarding imaging techniques, Mr. Jyothikumar provided incredible insight regarding minicell visualization and quantification, as well as PSR quantification.  We greatly appreciate his support.
Michael Wormington, PhD - Minicells as a Biological Chassis
Associate Professor and Associate Chair of Biology, University of Virginia
Prof. Wormington provided key feedback during the early stages of our project’s development. As he first suggested that we study minicell’s potential as a chassis rather than as vaccine mechanism, we are eternally grateful for his direction.
David Kittlesen, PhD - Immunology and Minicells
Lecturer of Biology and Director of Biology Summer Session, University of Virginia
We greatly appreciate Prof. Kittlesen’s insight into the immune system, particularly with regard to potential immune response to minicells.
Kay Christopher - Laboratory Manager
Upper Level Labs Preparator, University of Virginia
Mrs. Christopher graciously helped us secure our labspace, providing us with laboratory materials and checking that our equipment complied with all appropriate biosafety requirements.
Daniel Engel, PhD - Laboratory Support
Professor of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia
Dr. Engel generously provided additional BSL-2 lab space, equipment, and resources necessary for our project.
Linda Columbus, PhD - Laboratory Support
Associate Professor of Chemistry, Molecular Physiology, and Biological Physics, University of Virginia
Dr. Columbus generously provided additional lab space, equipment, and resources necessary for our project.
Loren Erickson, PhD - Laboratory Support
Associate Professor, Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia
Dr. Erickson generously provided secondary antibodies required by our applications team.
Virginia Miller, PhD, and Kimberly Walker, PhD - Ail Plasmid
Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, UNC-Chapel Hill
A renowned expert on the Yersinia ail gene, Dr. Miller works as a professor in the Department of Genetics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Dr. Walker, a research professor in the Miller lab, kindly donated the ail plasmid used by our applications team, while also providing  invaluable expertise regarding various protocols.
Willie Vann, PhD - pSR23 Plasmid
Food and Drug Administration
Dr. Vann kindly donated the pSR23 plasmid used by our applications team, while also providing invaluable expertise regarding various protocols.
Becky Wilbur, PhD, and Anna Minutella
Renaissance School – High School Collaboration
A local high school in downtown Charlottesville, Renaissance worked with our team to develop an educational workshop series. We appreciate their enthusiasm regarding our programming, as they have even expanded their curriculum to include a DNA Science Course.
Dr. Michael Timko - Bioethical Considerations and Laboratory Support
Director of the Human Biology Program and Professor of Biology, University of Virginia
Dr. Michael Timko graciously agreed to an interview regarding the bioethical considerations of synthetic biology. In addition, we are truly grateful for his laboratory support, sharing various resources with our team.
Dr. John Arras - Bioethical Considerations
U.S. Presidential Commission on Bioethics
Dr. John Arras graciously agreed to an interview regarding the bioethical considerations of synthetic biology, providing invaluable insight regarding oversight mechanisms, biosafety concerns, open source research, and our minicell project.
