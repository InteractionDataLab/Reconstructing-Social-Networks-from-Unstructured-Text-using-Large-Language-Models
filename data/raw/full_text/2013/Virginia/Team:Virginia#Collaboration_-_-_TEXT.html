Collaboration
Keith Kozminski
Associate Professor of Biology.
As an advisor of all things iGEM related as well as a continual source of information and aid at all hours of the day and night, we can only hope banana bread and a trip to Canada keep this man on our side.
Inchan Kwon
Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering.
Regular meetings and advice on project direction make us truly thankful for Dr. Kwon as an advisor.
Jason Papin
Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering.
Advising us on all things iGEM and pushing the limits of our modeling skills have made Dr. Papin invaluable.
Renaissance School
Renaissance is a local college preparatory school that has been working with our team to allow us to design and teach a course introducing students to synthetic biology. Our main contacts and supporters are Dr. Becky Wilbur and Mrs. Minutella.
Allison Chriss
PI of the Chriss lab in UVa Medical School's Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology.
Her advice greatly helped the applications side of our project.
