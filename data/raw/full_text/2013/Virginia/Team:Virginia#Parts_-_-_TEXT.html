BBa_K1011000 encodes the FtsZ gene. When overexpressed, the FtsZ gene leads to z-ring formation at the cell poles rather than along the cell midline, leading to minicell production.
BBa_S05211 encodes a strong RBS and the GFP gene. This part was produced as an intermediate.
BBa_S05212 encodes a strong RBS, the GFP gene, and a double terminator. This part was produced as an intermediate, although it is particularly useful as a reporter gene construct for insertion behind the target gene.
BBa_S05213 encodes an IPTG-inducible promoter, a strong RBS, and the FtsZ gene. This part was produced as an intermediate.
BBa_K1011001 encodes our final construct: an IPTG-inducible promoter, a strong RBS, the FtsZ gene, a strong RBS, the GFP gene, and a double terminator. As overexpression of FtsZ induces minicell formation, GFP serves as a reporter. Use of the ITPG promoter grants control over the level of FtsZ overproduction, which may thus be tuned to optimal minicell production.
