Antibody production and secretion
Phaeodactylum tricornutum was firstly transfected (see Phaeo protocols ) with the antibody expression vector consisting of the heavy and light chain of the Hepatitis B antibody under the control of the nitrate reductase promoter as well as the zeocin resistance.
The microalgae were grown to an OD of 0,4 in medium containing 0,9 mM NO3-. Afterwards the proteins of 2 ml culture were extracted.
Cell culture is centrifuged for 5 minutes (13000 g)
Supernatant and pellet were divided into two tubes
Add 150µl sodium hydroxide to the cell pellet to disrupt the cells (not to the supernatant)
Incubate 10 minutes on ice
Add 850 µl bidest water
Add 200 µl 70 % TCA to the disrupted cells and to the supernatant
Incubate for 20 minutes on ice
Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4 °C (20000xg)
Wash pellet with aceton and centrifuge for 15 minutes at 4 °C
Repeat the latter step until the chlorophyll is washed out
Dry pellet at room temperature
Resuspend in 8 M urea-buffer
Shake the samples for 15 minutes at 60 °C
Composition of the urea-buffer (for 40 ml):
Urea 8 M

Analysis of the light-inducible promotor
Induction by light
Phaeodactylum tricornutum expressing GFP under the light inducible promoter was grown for one week in a climate chamber. After that we put it into complete darkness for four days, for degradation of GFP and minimize the amount left in the cells. Thereafter we grew it for 24 hours under different light conditions to test the light inducible promoter.
Five conditions were tested:
 
Quantum fluence rate [µmol/ m2s]
 
wavelength [nm]
 
intensity [µW/cm2]

After exposure the cells were harvested in darkness in 1 ml aliquots at 13,000 rpm and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted as described above. With the extracted proteins we performed a Western blot (see below) to investigate if the promoter works and to quantify the expression of GFP under the different conditions.
Western blot
To identify our proteins we performed Western blots. In a Western blot proteins can be detected by antibodies. Therefore a first antibody binds specifically to the protein of interest and a second antibody that is specific to the first antibody is added for detection. The second antibody is fused with a reporter enzyme (e.g. horseradish peroxidase) that allows detection of chemiluminescence after treatment with a chemiluminescence agent.
In order to blot proteins a SDS gel electrophoresis was performed and afterwards blotted onto a nitro cellulose membrane. To accomplish this four Whatman filter papers were soaked into membrane buffer and a nitro cellulose membrane, also soaked in membrane buffer, were stacked. On this the SDS gel was placed and covered with with four Whatman filter papers soaked with gel buffer. Then the proteins were transferred with 0.8 mA/cm2 for two hours.
To prevent unspecific binding of the first antibody, the membrane was rotated for at least one hour in 5 % milk powder in TBST at 4 °C. The primary antibody was dissolved in 2 % milk powder in TBST (dillution: 1:500 anti GFP, anti IgG 1:10,000, all antibodies obtained by Santa Cruz biotechnology) and added to the membrane. Afterwards it was washed two times in TBST for five minutes. The secondary antibody was dissolved in 2 % milk powder in TBST (anti anti GFP 1:10,000, anti anti IgG 1:10,000), added to the membrane and incubated for one hour. Afterwards it was washed with TBST for three times for five minutes each. After incubation with a detection agent, containing Luminol, p-Coumaric acid and H2O2, the detection was performed with a Chemocam Professional from INTAS science imaging.
