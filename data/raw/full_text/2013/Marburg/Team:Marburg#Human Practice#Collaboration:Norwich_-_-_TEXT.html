Resistance against different and multiple antibiotics is an upcoming challenge in the health sector especially in hospitals. Even organisms with resistance against antibiotics of last resort have been detected. That is the reason why it becomes more important to find new antibiotics and to improve existing systems to discover new groups of active agents. Hence the iGEM team Norwich decided to design a system able to find novel antimycin-producing strains of Streptomyces.  In order to support the Norwich team with their effort we sent three different soil samples from Marburg.
The iGEM team Marburg is curious about the progress in the development of the biosensor and pleased to meet them during the jamboree in Lyon.
