BioBricks
Construction of specific P. tricornutum BioBricks .
Vector Design
Design of P. tricornutum specific vectors.
Transfection
Transfection of vectors into P. tricornutum.
PHAECTORY
Growth of PHAECTORY needs only sunlight and is CO2-neutral.
Products
Isolation of complex proteins (e.g. antibodies), which were secreted from PHAECTORY.
Here we present a schematic overview on the milestones of our project. Just click on each of the production steps to learn more about our way of building PHAECTORY.
BioBricks : In a first step standardized BioBricks for Phaeodactylum tricornutum have to be designed in order to produce complex proteins of choice.
Vector design : Use our provided BioBricks to create your individual expression vector.
Transfection : With the help of our transfection protocol, it is easy to rapidly integrate novel genetic information into the genome of P. tricornutum.
PHAECTORY : Phaeodactylum tricornutum can be used for the large-scale production of your protein of choice. PHAECTORY needs therefore only a salt medium or sea water, sunlight and CO2.
Products : All kinds of complex proteins, bioplastic, spider silk and biofuel can easily be produced with PHAECTORY . Therebye, the high-quality products are directly secreted into the medium.
