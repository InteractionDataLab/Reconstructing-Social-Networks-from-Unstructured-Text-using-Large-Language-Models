Marburg is a university city with a long-standing tradition in the heart of Germany. The Philipps-University Marburg is among the most traditional universities in Europe and was founded as early as 1527. Today’s research at the university covers the full spectrum of modern science. In particular, the faculties of natural sciences are amongst the best in Germany.
Among many other collaborative research centers, the LOEWE Center for Synthetic Microbiology (SYNMIKRO) plays a central role in establishing a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research network connecting over 35 groups at the University of Marburg and the Max-Planck-Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology . Until today, SYNMIKRO is one of the biggest establishments for research on synthetic-microbial biology in Germany. Numerous organizations complement and enrich the university’s range of services. For example, such organizations may carry out special research activities or support in the areas of communications, IT and foreign languages.
