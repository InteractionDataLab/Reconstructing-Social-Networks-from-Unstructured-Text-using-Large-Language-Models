We are fascinated by synthetic biology and our own iGEM project. But when we shared our enthusiasm, we soon noticed that in general little is known about this new research field.
Therefore, we focused on two major goals in our Human Practice work. On the one hand we drew more attention on synthetic biology and on the other hand we looked critically at our own project from various perspectives.
