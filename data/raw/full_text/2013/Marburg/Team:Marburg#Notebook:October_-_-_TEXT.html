Test of antibody production
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Preparation for Western Blotting.
To demonstrate the production of antibodies in the induced cultures 2.1 and 4.2 a Western Blot should be performed. For this purpose, the cells were harvested and the pellet was separated from the supernatant. After that, a TCA precipitation was performed. All samples were stored at -20°C.

Cell disruption by means of sonication
Investigator: Franzi
Aim: Find the best buffer for sonication disruption method.
To examine whether the PBS buffer or the IP buffer is best for disruption by means of sonication, we performed a sonication with both buffers. Afterwards a TCA precipitation was made and a SDS-PAGE was carried out.
Result: We gained higher amounts of protein by using the IP buffer. Consequently, all following cell disruptions by sonication were performed with IP buffer.
Light-inducible promoter
Investigators: Domenica and Dominik
Aim: Characterization of the light-inducible promotor PfcpB ( BBa_K1071003 ).
After two days of incubation in darkness, the culture was divided in 5 samples, which were incubated under 5 different light conditions: normal light, green light, red light, blue light (50 µE each) and darkness. The division was realised in darkness to prevent induction of the light-inducible promoter. OD (600 nm): 0.450.
 
Test of antibody production
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Western Blot of samples before and after induction.
The samples that were taken the previous day and the days before induction with nitrate were used for a 12 % SDS gel (see above) and subsequent Western blotting on a  nitro cellulose membrane. To accomplish this four Whatman filter papers were soaked into membrane buffer and a nitro cellulose membrane, also soaked in membrane buffer, were stacked. On this the SDS gel was placed and covered with with four Whatman filter papers soaked with gel buffer. Then the proteins were transferred with 0.8 mA/cm2 for two hours.
To prevent unspecific binding of the first antibody, the membrane was rotated for at least one hour in 5 % milk powder in TBST at 4 °C. The primary antibody was dissolved in 2 % milk powder in TBST (dillution: 1:500 anti GFP, anti IgG 1:10,000, all antibodies obtained by Santa Cruz biotechnology) and added to the membrane. Afterwards it was washed two times in TBST for five minutes. The secondary antibody was dissolved in 2 % milk powder in TBST (anti anti GFP 1:10,000, anti anti IgG 1:10,000), added to the membrane and incubated for one hour. Afterwards it was washed with TBST for three times for five minutes each. After incubation with a detection agent, containing Luminol, p-Coumaric acid and H2O2, the detection was performed with a Chemocam Professional from INTAS science imaging.

Western blot 1
In these samples that were taken before the induction, bands at 80 kDa could be detected. They could be due to unspecific bounding of the antibodies.
The second blot, containing the samples that were taken after induction, failed because of a lack of enough transfer buffer.
Additionally, due to insufficient blocking steps, much background signal was observed. For that reason, no statements about the production of antibodies can be made.

Test of antibody production
Investigators: Dominik, Franzi and Domenica
Aim: Harvesting, cell disruption and TCA prepipitation.
10 mL of the culture were harvested for cell disruption with sonication (see protocol below), 1 mL for cell disruption with the ball mill, and 1 mL as a reserve. Cells were disrupted with sonication and the ball mill. Optical density (at 600 nm) was measured for each sample.

Sonication
Investigators: Franzi, Marco
Aim: Quantification of the light-inducible promoter PfcpB ( BBa_K1071003 )
→ Cell disruption, protein precipitation and SDS-PAGE.
10 ml of cultures grown under different light conditions (green, blue, red, full light spectrum and darkness) were harvested in 15 ml Falcon-tubes (5 min centrifugation at full speed). Supernatants were discarded and pellets frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Frozen cell-pellets were resuspended in 1,7 ml IP buffer and sonicated (48 cycles, 30 sec on, 30 sec off, 4°C, high). Extract was centrifuged at 7000 rcf for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred in a new reaction tube.
1,7 µl supernatant of cell lysis were mixed with 350 µl 70 % TCA and incubated for 20 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 20.000 rcf and the pellet washed twice with 1 ml acetone. The pellet was dried at RT and resuspended in 60 µl 8M ureabuffer (15 min 60 °C).
10 µg of each sample were used for SDS-PAGE (Westernblot).
Amido black assay
Investigators: Franzi, Dominik, Domenica
Aim: Quantification of PfcpB → Quantification of protein amount.
5 µl of protein (in urea buffer) from sonication and ball mill disruption were used.
The following protocol was used:
195 µl H2O
5 µl sample (or 5 µl H2O as negative control)
800 µl amido black solution (0.1 % amido black solution, 90 % MeOH, 10 % acetic acid (100 %))
Invert 3 times → precipitation of protein-amido black complex
Centrife: 10 min @ 14,000 rpm
Discard supernatant
Add 1 ml washing solution (90 % EtOH, 10 % acetic acid (100 %))
Centrife: 10 min @ 14,000 rpm
Discard supernatant
Add 1 ml 0.2 M NaOH → complete bleaching of the pellet
The protein concentration can be determined photometrically by measuring the absorbance at 615 nm and by comparing the values with a standard curve (created with different amounts of BSA).
Measured protein concentrations for sonication samples:
Dark: 2.10 µg/µl
Red: 2.49 µg/µl
Green: 2.80 µg/µl
Blue: 3.23 µg/µl
Measured protein concentrations for ball mill samples:
Light: 0.517 µg/µl
Dark: 0.314 µg/µl
Red: 0.639 µg/µl
Green: 0.385 µg/µl
Blue: 0.619 µg/µl
Protein extraction from herbal leafs
Investigators: Domenica, Franzi and Dominik
Aim: Protein extraktion (positive control).
As a positive control, we extracted a protein-coding gene, cry-gfp, out of Arabidopsis landsberg erecta, which produces GFP as well as tubulin. For this purpose, 228 mg leafs were mixed with 114 µL PEG extraction buffer. Following this, the cells were disrupted with a Polytron PT 1200E Blade-type homogenizer (Brinkmann) and 5 min in a sonication bath. After centrifugation (15 min, 20000g, 4°C), the supernatant was used as protein extract. The concentration of protein was determined using a Bradford assay (Roti Quant, Roth).
