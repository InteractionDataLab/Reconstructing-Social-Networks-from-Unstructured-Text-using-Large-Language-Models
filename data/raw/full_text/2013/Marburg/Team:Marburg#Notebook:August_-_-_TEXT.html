Sequencing
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Examination of the sequence of pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB10+iBB96315.
2 additional sequence samples were sent out for sequencing.
Digest
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Test digest of pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315 with EcoRI and PstI
1 µl Plasmid (pSB1C3-iBB39,pSB1A3-iBB49 and pSB1C3-iBB6315)
0.3 µl EcoRI
0.3 µl Pst
1 µl CutSmart
7.4 µl ddbidest. H2O
The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.
After that, a gel electrophoresis was made, but failed and has to be repeated the next day
Inoculation
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: inoculation of colonies for plasmid preparation
4 colonies of pSB1A3-iBB496315 were inoculated in 5 ml LB medium containing ampicillin.

Sequencing
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Analysis of the sequence of pSB1A3-iBB496315.
Obviously the wrong plasmid was sent out for sequencing. Due to the lack of enough plasmids for an additional sequence analysis, we will redo a new miniprep.
Transformation
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Transformation of E. coli DH5α with the plasmid DNA pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB10+iBB96315 and pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315.
The chemo competent E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the plasmids pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB10+iBB96315 and pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315 and plated on LB-Amp-plates.
The plates were incubated over night at 37 °C.

Miniprep
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: preparation of the plasmid pSB1A3-iBB496315.
The plasmids were isolated with the “QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit” (Qiagen, Düsseldorf) according to the producer instructions.
Digest
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Test digest of pSB1A3-iBB496315 and iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315 with EcoRI and PstI
1 µl Plasmid (pSB1A3-iBB496315 and iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315)
0.3 µl EcoRI
0.3 µl PstI
1 µl CutSmart
7.4 µl ddbidest. H2O
The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.
Gel electrophoresis
Gel substances
1% Agarose gel
10 µl RedSafe in 50 ml gel
6 µl GeneRuler™ 1kb plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific)
Worked as expected.
14.08.2013
Sequencing
Investigator: Dominik
Aim: Examination of sequence analysis of the plasmids pSB1A3-iBB496315, pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB10+iBB96315 and pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315.
pSB1A3-iBB496315: Okay
pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB10+iBB96315: mutation in signal peptide that leads to Trp → Leu. Will be ignored
pSB1A3-iBB4+iBB13+iBB96315: mutation in terminator, will be ignored.
All plasmids are brought to Marian who will transform them into P. tricornutum cells.
