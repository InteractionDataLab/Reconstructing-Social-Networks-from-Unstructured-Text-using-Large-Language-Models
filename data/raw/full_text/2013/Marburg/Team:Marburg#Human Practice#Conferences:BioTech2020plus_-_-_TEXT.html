The iGEM Team Marburg was invited to join the "Abschlusskongress, Bilanz und Ausblick der Initiative Biotechnologie 2020+" in Berlin, Germany.
Initiative Biotechnology 2020+ is an initiative by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) to support successful cooperation’s between academic institutions and industry to foster biotechnology. The program is new and an important objective of the congress in Berlin was to present an outlook on the first phase of the strategy process.
Dr. Helge Braun, the parliamentary State Secretary of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, opened the congress by introducing Biotechnology 2020+. Five representatives of research institutes societies in Germany led the following discussion round, which was moderated by Karsten Schwanke. Dr. Hans-Otto Feldhütter (Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft), Prof. Dr. Doris Wedlich (Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft), Prof. Dr. Herbert Jäckle (Max-Plank-Gesellschaft), Prof. Axel Brakhage (Leibniz-Gemeinschaft) and Prof. Dr. Dietmar Schoburg (Technische Universität Braunschweig) presented various arguments concerning the previous activities of the Initiative Biotechnology 2020+, which pinpoint out the parts need of change. The discussion was finalized with the introduction of many recommendations for the continuation of the Initiative Biotechnology 2020+. Afterwards, an exhibition of the research projects of all present research societies took place.
For us, the most important event of the conference was the presentation of the projects of all iGEM Teams in Germany for the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM) in 2013. It was great to meet members of the other german iGEM teams, to exchange ideas and to discuss questions. Taken together, a nice point to start networking!
