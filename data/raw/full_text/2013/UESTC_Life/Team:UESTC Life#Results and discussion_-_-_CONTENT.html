The concentration of the products were confirmed using GC column(AC5). Growth resulted in disappearance of the substrate and simultaneous formation of biomass, 2,3-DCP,  epichlorohydrin, chloropropanol, and glycerol. The result was screened by GC analysis. Above the degradation of TCP and the intermediate product 2,3-DCP indicated that multistep biodegradation was happened. (Fig.1 and Fig.2). When the <I>E.coli</I> carried <I>DhaA+P2A+HheC</I> gene cultivated in medium with 2,3-DCP, the concentration of epichlorohydrin have been detected(Fig.2). 2,3-DCP was degraded to epichlorohydrin. Chloropropanol and glycerol couldn’t be detected by our columns. Since the two active enzymes were in bacteria, if the degradation followed the theoretic pathway (refer to project), TCP would be degraded to glycerol in the end.  In the future, new columns and methods will be used to further proof the result.</FONT></DD></DL><P>

But available columns were limited, hence the intermediate product couldn’t be detected. Through SDS-PAGE analysis, F2A peptide could cleave LinA and LinB(Fig.5). LinB would degrade the intermediate product of γ-HCH and according to theory, the γ-HCH could be degraded to desired low toxic compounds.</FONT></DD></DL><P>

The bacteria carried gene <I>LinA+F2A+LinB</I> degraded γ-HCH(5mM) but the intermediate product couldn't be detected. Blank control(empty vector) have been added, the concentration of γ-HCH merely remained unchanged.

FIG.5. SDS-PAGE analysis. Supernatant and sediment collected after breaking cell. Lane1 and lane2 are blank controls, in the lane3 and lane5 LinA and LinB are solved in the buffer; in the lane7 and lane8, F2A peptide cleaved LinA and LinB, both of them are solved. The most of protein, LinA+F2A+LinB, is in the sediment as a kind of inclusion body.

Only if four HheC subunits compose together as a tetramer can it catalyze dehalogenation. Measuring the activity of HheC in chimeric protein DhaA+P2A+HheC is an ideal way to detect the effect of P2A peptide. The purified enzymes, HheC and DhaA+P2A+HheC chimeric protein was isolated by AKTA FPLC. Using substrate 1,3-DCP, HheC specific activity was 6.72(U/mg) and the chimeric protein specific activity is 5.28(U/mg). It indicated that the 2A peptide was an excellent linker to compose the two enzymes together.</FONT></DD></DL><P>
