Several technologies have been studied as alternatives to 

petroleum-based fuels. Among these stands out the technology of 

fuel cells due to their diverse field of application extends from 

portable devices to generate stationary, including automotive use. 

Although the high cost still prevents the application of such devices 

on a large scale, reduced cost, weight and increase efficiency, will 

provide a rapid growth in the use of fuel cells. The technology of fuel 

cells is divided into two categories electrochemical fuel cells (also 

called conventional) and biocells fuel (or fuel cell biological - MFC), 

the latter having received extensive attention in the past three years.  

For the production of electricity, the MFC operates with two sections 

(one cathode-anode-aerobic and anaerobic), separated by an ion 

selective membrane H. Micro-organisms are used to catalyze the 

oxidation of organic matter, generating electricity by transfer of 

electrons to an external circuit, introduced before the step of reducing 

an electron acceptor. In the anaerobic compartment is the oxidation 

of organic material, with formation of CO2, protons and electrons. 

The generated protons migrate to the aerobic compartment (cathodic 

chamber) permeating through the proton exchange membrane. The 

produced electrons are transferred to the cathode through the 

external circuit, and this surface is the reduction of oxygen to water. 

This flow of electrons through the external circuit generates an 

electrical current that can be measured and used to do work. The 

overall cell reaction is the conversion of biodegradable organic 

material to carbon dioxide and water, generating electricity in the 

process. The electrodes can not colonized by a few species of 

bacteria. Electroactive bacteria can transfer electrons to the 

electrode surface without the need for redox mediators. Some of the 

micro-organisms known more electrochemical active  Shewanella 

putrefaciens and Shewanella oneidensis, the Gamma-proteobacteria, 

Geobacter sulfurreducens,  Geobacter metallireducens and 

Desulfuromonas acetoxidans all Deltaproteobacteria and Rhodoferax 

ferrireducens the  Betaproteobacteria. The MFCs form a promising 

technology for sewage treatment, as a method of recovering energy 

in the form of hydrogen or electricity. In 2004, there was a change in 

the relationship between electricity production and sewage treatment, 

when it was shown that wastewater can be treated at practical levels 

parallel to power generation. The amount of energy generated in the 

study, although low, can be considered high compared to previous 

studies. Reimers, 2001, demonstrated that inorganic and organic 

materials present in marine sediments could be used in a new type of 

MFC, with the use of variety of substrates, new materials and 

structural arrangements in the construction of the MFCs.

Procedures
1) Machining of acrylic pieces.

The acrylic pieces were cut according to the specifications.

Assembly

 • Plates were united in order to form a rectangle with 

cyanoacrylate based glue as shown below:

Electrode:

Aluminum wire was wound and coated with a carbon fiber for 

A heat sink aluminum was used as the counter electrode to the 

SETUP OF MEASUREMENT DEVICE

The electrodes were connected to a resistor of 0.9620 KΩ, and 

then connected to an Agilent U1252A multimeter. The potential was 

measured at intervals of 15 minutes by 9hrs30min, and stored. From 

the same may construct the table below, where the MFC produced 

watts / hour.

This means that the MFC produced is necessary to feed our 

own meter for approximately 5.6 minutes. The calculations below 

demonstrate our conclusion:

Current battery power meter = 2.8mA = I.

Supply voltage meter = 7.38 V = V

Power generated by the MFC = 1930.085 μW

Power required by multimeter:

P = VXI = 7.38V x 0.0028 = nd = 0.020664W 20664μW

PMFC / Pmultimetro = 0.093405 h ≈ 5.6 minutes

The electricity generated is measured as follows:

The MFC electrodes are connected in parallel with the 

multimeter, whose terminals are also placed in parallel with screw 

terminals, so that there is overhang of the screws engaged in the 

junction, in order to connect, also in parallel with a resistor (15 k) with 

sole purpose of measuring its power.

The voltage produced by the full MFC suffers a fall due to 

the consumption of the load. With a quarter of a period of time, it is 

checked potential difference &quot;up&quot; resistor, so in the end of 8 hours of 

perform the integration of the power to obtain energy.

Through the knowledge of Ohm's law, we know that the voltage 

produced undergoes substantial decrease before the presence of the 

load, which does not affect the efficiency of the system.
