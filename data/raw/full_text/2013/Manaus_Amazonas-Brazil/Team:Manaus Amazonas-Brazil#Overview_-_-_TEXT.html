Overview
Our project aim increased the degradation of fatty acid (Beta  oxidation pathway) in Shewanella putrefaciens. So, we choose 2   methodologies to do that.  1° inhibition of the FadR expression (fatty acid   metabolism regulator protein)  The beta-oxidation is not a constituve pathway but with the   mutation of the transcription factor, FadR, which functions as a   switch that co-ordinately regulates the machinery required for fatty   acid beta-oxidation, we hope turn this pathway constituve.  To   increased the degradation of fatty acid by S. Putrefaciens.  2° Increase the FadL and FadD expression.  Our second step in  genetic engineering of  Shewanella is   overexpression of two important genes for beta oxidation : (1)   The FadL, Long-chain fatty acid outer membrane transporte, is a   gene of fatty acid transport protein, outer membrane; long-chain   fatty acid receptor to enhance the long chain fatty acids intake   by Shewanella putrefaciens and (2) The FadD, Long-chain-fattyacid-CoA ligase, ligates CoA in fatty acid chain preparing it to get   into the Beta-Oxidation metabolic pathway. These overexpression   will increased B-oxidation and therefore ATP, H+ and electrons   production.
