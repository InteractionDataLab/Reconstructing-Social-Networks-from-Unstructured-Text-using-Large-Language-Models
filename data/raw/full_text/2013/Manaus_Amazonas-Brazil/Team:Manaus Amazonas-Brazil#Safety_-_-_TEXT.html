*For additional organisms, please include a spreadsheet in your submission.
2. Highest Risk Group Listed:
1                               Greater than 1
If you answered 1+, please also complete the iGEM Biosafety form part 2 for any organisms in this category.
3. List and describe all new or modified coding regions you will be using in your project. (If you use parts from the 2013 (iGEM Distribution without modifying them, you do not need to list those parts.)

4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe:
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Under biosafety guidelines level 1 there is no risks. To ensure no harm a lab and biosafety workshop was accomplished.The workshop consisted in one week training protocols, good microbiological work practices, techniques involving genetic engineering and proper disposal and decontamination.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
The Shewanella putrefaciens is a common bacteria found in fresh, brackish, marine water and mud. So this strain will not cause any harm to general public if released. According to http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ .
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
The bacteria are found normally in healthy marine animals. The designed genes are involved in Fatty Acid degradation. These genes are only expressed under lab conditions (right media composition, pH, temperature, etc).
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
Designs are constructed based in delection or overexpression of genes, and the chassis are not harmful and have non potential of being used as microbiological device in any malicious intention.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
Our project have the potential to be scaled-up. Therefore its premature to say that is plenty possible. The scaling-up might be feasible under fermentation tanks under an intense optimization work. Open Methodology, could be a great oportunity to improve our idea and find partners for that.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis,etc. ) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
Not so far, but we are choosing a device for that purpose.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
We had a biosafety workshop and also attended one semester class in the biotechnology under graduation course.
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.
http://propesp.ufam.edu.br/attachments/018_Res0272008sep_Atividade%20de. The labs we are working are under credentials of CTNBio http://www.ctnbio.gov.br/index.php/content/view/865.html ).
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
Yes, Ufam biosafety committee. They reviewed our methodology. The biosafety board didn`t have any concern on the experimental approaches
.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
Yes, http://www.ctnbio.gov.br/index.php
d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? (Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features [see 2013.igem.org/Safety for help].
Our lab is rated in the biosafety level 1.
e. What is the Risk Group of your chassis organism(s), as you stated in question 1? If it does not match the BSL rating of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are taking.
Risk Group 1.
