Background
The main focus of the project is generate electric energy  through degradation of fatty acid present in waste frying oil,   which are widely used and discarded by restaurants, when   these oils are disposed improperly they present as a pollutant to   the environment, so the treatment to eliminate these pollutants   requires the use of toxic chemicals products, besides that the   process is costly and inefficient. There are alternatives to the use   of frying oils as the production of soap, but the directing of fats for   energy generation will bring a new option for bioenergy through   bioremediation.  The bacteria  Shewanella putrefaciens that we pretend to   use is capable to do electron`s transport disposed in the media,   generating electricity. The proposal is to improve it genetically to   degrade these oils through β-oxidation (biochemical reaction that   break of fatty acids), increasing the production of electrons. The   genus Shewanella is a group of bacteria recently discovered and   the studies on them are scarce, especially in the area of molecular   biology, but have the potencial not only for energy generation   possibility but also for the ability of capture metals arranged in the   ambient.  Among the possibilities to modify it, we chose two ways:   knockout the repressor (FadR) of beta oxidation pathway and   overexpression two important proteins (FadD and FadL) to   beta oxidation pathway.The effects of these modification gene   should be studied to not generate a stress condition. With this   environmental and ecological project design, we are excited,   determined to participate in iGEM and be the first team to   represent the state of Amazonas.
