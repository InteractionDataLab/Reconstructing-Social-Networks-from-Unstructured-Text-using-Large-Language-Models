High School
This year, we set our outreach activities with three main goals in   mind:  • Assess the environmental risks associated with our project,  • Educate the public about synthetic biology and how it pertains   to everyday life  • Exchange ideas and explain to some restaurants how to make   proper oil disposal  During the event “What is this have to do with biodiversity?” in the   Federal University of Amazonas we focused on high school students   from Manaus, we have set lectures and practicum activities in a   didactic and entertaining way. Working with some questioning   sections such as “What is all about synthetic biology and iGEM?”,   “Differences between fungi and bacteria”, “what is this project   Electrobacter?" and “How should be the proper way to dispose used   frying oil?”. This year the event had more than sixty students from   several high schools.  Having in mind this challenge we made this experience the more   “learning by doing” we could, bringing up petri dishes with GFP   transformed bactérias, fungi from diferent species, to show the   class many sorts of microrganism forms of live, and as well to know   some of the research which is done at the University . It was also   developed dynamics to illustrate what happens when playing the   fried oils down in the drain and it arrives  in the rivers and soils    through the use of water, toy fish, a becker and a little oil an why   that happens. In addition, it was showed the correct management to   carry out the disposal of these fried oils and how we intend to give a   new destination for them through our project.  This event is annually realized for UFAM and INPA searches with   the intention of estimulate high school students to follow in the   scientific career, satiate their scientific facts about everything in   biology, and teach academics different forms of teach and to acquire   skills of adaptation, since many of them will follow career as not only   like researchers, but also as teacher and that the purpose of this   event is to assemble the according’s programming to all questions   brought by students on the first day of the event avoiding the use of   formal lectures and prioritizing dynamics, theater, etc.
