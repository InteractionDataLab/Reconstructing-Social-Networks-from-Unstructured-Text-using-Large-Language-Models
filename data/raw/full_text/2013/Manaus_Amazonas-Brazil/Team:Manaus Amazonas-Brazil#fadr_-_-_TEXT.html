FADR
How are we going to knockout the FadR gene?  To do that, we choose two alternatives: the first is gene   interruption for homologous recombination and the second is   deleted the FadR gene using a two-step asymmetric/crossover   PCR amplification.  (1) We design primers to the internal region of FadR gene   and after the amplification we insert this gene in a TOPO vector,   cloning in E. coli RR1, miniprep the plasmids, digest with ApaI and   BamHI and ligation the insert in pKNOCK and pNPT138 plasmids   digested tih ApaI and BamHI.
Fig 1. Design of pKNOCK Integrative vector with FadR   internal region.  And these plasmid will be transformed in  Shewanella   putrefaciens to occur homologous recombination and the FadR   gene be interruption by vector integration.  (2) Design PCR primers to amplify the regions flanking the   gene FadR. Subsequent to amplification, these flanking regions   are fused together via a complementary “tag” region.  This fusion   product will then be inserted into the suicide vector pNPTS138.

Depending on whether the   recombination occurred between the 5’ fragments or the   3’ fragments, you will obtain one of the above insertion   patterns (A or B).  And then we will force a excision of the suicide plasmid by   cultive in extress médium (Lb with 5% of sucarose, without NaCl   and antibiotcs) turn deleted gene copy strain or wild type
