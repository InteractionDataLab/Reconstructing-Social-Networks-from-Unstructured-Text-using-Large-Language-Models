Collaboration
An iGEM team outreach goes to Amazon (we mean..inner   Amazon)  Our team went to an adventure in the rainforest; we went to   Manicoré,  a municipality located in the south-east of the Brazilian   state of Amazonas. Its population is about 48,000 souls (2012) and   its area is 48,282 km². As all little towns in Amazon rainforest its   inhabitants are from small satellite communities. The town itself has   half of the population we mentioned before.   The origin of Manicoré name is from the river that has the   same name, one of the main affluent of Madeira River, itself one   of the most important arms of the might Amazon River. The name   Manicoré stands for an old Indian tribe that inhabited the region   before the colonization from Portuguese.
Municipality of Manicoré
To get there we traveled about 400Km toward south and   spend twelve hours through a nice and bumpy highway: the river   Madeira. Yes, we’ve made by boat! These are the truly highways in   Amazon.
Our route from Manaus to Manicoré: ~400km away
We joined another group also working at University of  Amazonas from Chemistry department, participating with then  in the event called: Unveiling the Forensic Science. Since our   Electrobacter-iGEM project is about (also) environment, as we are   proposing a system that reduces used frying oil spills, we fitted in   their Environment Forensic Science, cool isn’t? So, for first we’ve  made lots new friends from our own University!  And after see the stunning and beautiful Amazonian   landscapes and sunrise and sunset we finally reach the target! What  trip!

Opening cerimony
We had a municipal high school to occupy and give three day   course with dynamics and practicum for the students from Manicoré   and surroundings. We have more than 300 students participating   in the whole thing counting the three days. We made some plays;   DNA extraction from onion, banana, pineapple; talked about the   used frying  oil environmental issues and legislation about it; and   of course we talked a lot how SynBio can solve this in the future,   therefore we spread the news about iGEM, our participation in the   competition and how it works.   On the boat again….  In the last day we get together with about 40 students in a   two-deck regional boat and we talked about the importance of   the hydrological system in Amazon and other tropical rainforest   in the world (nothing better than do this inside a boat!), and our   dependency from these waters and ecosystems. We also stressed   the point about the use of used frying oil and the threats of it in the   way we humans are doing.
It was a wonderful experience and made us feel more   Amazonians than ever. We learned a lot and now we can say in   a practical way that science and education can transform lives   and synthetic biology is applicable and feasible for real world   problems. Besides, people over there have so much to be heard   that we could improve our way of doing research, but this is other   text to be written. Thanks for all that participate on that educational   adventure...It’s time to get on the boat once again and come back   home…
