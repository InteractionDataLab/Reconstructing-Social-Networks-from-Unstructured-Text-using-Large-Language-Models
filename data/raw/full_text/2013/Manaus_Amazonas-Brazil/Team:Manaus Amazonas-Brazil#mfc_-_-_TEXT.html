MFC
Several technologies have been studied as alternatives to   petroleum-based fuels. Among these stands out the technology of   fuel cells due to their diverse field of application extends from   portable devices to generate stationary, including automotive use.   Although the high cost still prevents the application of such devices   on a large scale, reduced cost, weight and increase efficiency, will   provide a rapid growth in the use of fuel cells. The technology of fuel   cells is divided into two categories electrochemical fuel cells (also   called conventional) and biocells fuel (or fuel cell biological - MFC),   the latter having received extensive attention in the past three years.    For the production of electricity, the MFC operates with two sections   (one cathode-anode-aerobic and anaerobic), separated by an ion   selective membrane H. Micro-organisms are used to catalyze the   oxidation of organic matter, generating electricity by transfer of   electrons to an external circuit, introduced before the step of reducing   an electron acceptor. In the anaerobic compartment is the oxidation   of organic material, with formation of CO2, protons and electrons.   The generated protons migrate to the aerobic compartment (cathodic   chamber) permeating through the proton exchange membrane. The   produced electrons are transferred to the cathode through the   external circuit, and this surface is the reduction of oxygen to water.   This flow of electrons through the external circuit generates an   electrical current that can be measured and used to do work. The   overall cell reaction is the conversion of biodegradable organic   material to carbon dioxide and water, generating electricity in the   process. The electrodes can not colonized by a few species of   bacteria. Electroactive bacteria can transfer electrons to the   electrode surface without the need for redox mediators. Some of the   micro-organisms known more electrochemical active  Shewanella   putrefaciens and Shewanella oneidensis, the Gamma-proteobacteria,   Geobacter sulfurreducens,  Geobacter metallireducens and   Desulfuromonas acetoxidans all Deltaproteobacteria and Rhodoferax   ferrireducens the  Betaproteobacteria. The MFCs form a promising   technology for sewage treatment, as a method of recovering energy   in the form of hydrogen or electricity. In 2004, there was a change in   the relationship between electricity production and sewage treatment,   when it was shown that wastewater can be treated at practical levels   parallel to power generation. The amount of energy generated in the   study, although low, can be considered high compared to previous   studies. Reimers, 2001, demonstrated that inorganic and organic   materials present in marine sediments could be used in a new type of   MFC, with the use of variety of substrates, new materials and   structural arrangements in the construction of the MFCs.

Procedures 1) Machining of acrylic pieces.  The acrylic pieces were cut according to the specifications.   MEMBRANE117  Assembly
• Plates were united in order to form a rectangle with   cyanoacrylate based glue as shown below:   https://igem.org/File:8.png  Electrode:  Aluminum wire was wound and coated with a carbon fiber for   A heat sink aluminum was used as the counter electrode to the   SETUP OF MEASUREMENT DEVICE  The electrodes were connected to a resistor of 0.9620 KΩ, and   then connected to an Agilent U1252A multimeter. The potential was   measured at intervals of 15 minutes by 9hrs30min, and stored. From   the same may construct the table below, where the MFC produced   watts / hour.
This means that the MFC produced is necessary to feed our   own meter for approximately 5.6 minutes. The calculations below   demonstrate our conclusion:  Current battery power meter = 2.8mA = I.  Supply voltage meter = 7.38 V = V  Power generated by the MFC = 1930.085 μW  Power required by multimeter:  P = VXI = 7.38V x 0.0028 = nd = 0.020664W 20664μW  PMFC / Pmultimetro = 0.093405 h ≈ 5.6 minutes  The electricity generated is measured as follows:  The MFC electrodes are connected in parallel with the   multimeter, whose terminals are also placed in parallel with screw   terminals, so that there is overhang of the screws engaged in the   junction, in order to connect, also in parallel with a resistor (15 k) with   sole purpose of measuring its power.  The voltage produced by the full MFC suffers a fall due to   the consumption of the load. With a quarter of a period of time, it is   checked potential difference "up" resistor, so in the end of 8 hours of   perform the integration of the power to obtain energy.  Through the knowledge of Ohm's law, we know that the voltage   produced undergoes substantial decrease before the presence of the   load, which does not affect the efficiency of the system.
