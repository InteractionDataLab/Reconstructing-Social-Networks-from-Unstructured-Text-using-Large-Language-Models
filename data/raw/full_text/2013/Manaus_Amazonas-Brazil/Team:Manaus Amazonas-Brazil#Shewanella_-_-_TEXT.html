Shewanella
Shewanella putrefaciens is a acquatic Gramnegative bacterium that was originally isolated from the sediments   of Lake Oneida It has been isolated from marine environments. S.   putrefaciens is an important model organism for bioremediation   because of its diverse respiratory capabilities conferred by   multicompetents systems and besides that, also use branched   electron system.  S. putrefaciens  is a facultatively aerobe,   however the diverse respiratoy capacity such as anaerobic   conditions offer an ability and a advantage to reduce iron and   other oxidized metals metabolically by terminal electron acceptors   chain (in contrast to obligate aerobes which must use oxygen for   this purpose), these metals includes  manganese and iron. The   bacterium have the capacity to thrive at low temperatures and the   Genome analysis predicts energy-generating pathways for many   fermentative end products (e.g., acetate, fumarate, pyruvate), that   analisis also shows the presence for metabolic pathways for   sugars and glycerol. In this way  S. putrefaciens  have several   biotechnological uses, so it can be widely applied in waste   containing high concentrations of metals such as waste frying oils   which bind to metals varied depending on the tool used.
