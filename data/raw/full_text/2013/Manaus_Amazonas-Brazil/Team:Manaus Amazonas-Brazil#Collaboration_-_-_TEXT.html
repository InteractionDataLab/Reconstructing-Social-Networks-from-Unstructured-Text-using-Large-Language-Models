Collaboration
At first, Marcelo Boareto (team of the USP) came to Manaus to   give us a course about Math modeling. In this course we knew a lit   bit more about the iGEM’s competition spirit and about the history of   the USP’s team and the project that was in competition on 2012. He   also told us about the project of this year (Detecthol). While Marcelo   Boareto was in Manaus, we changed experiences about synthetic   biology and we showed the university and laboratories  In August, there were the Jamboré event, where each   Brazilian team presented about their projects, this event counted   with a deep discussion about synthetic biology, and also each   team could help another, be on the laboratory experiments wiki   development and math modeling.
