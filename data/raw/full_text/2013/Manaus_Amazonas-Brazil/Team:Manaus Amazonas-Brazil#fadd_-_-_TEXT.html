FadD and FadL
How are we going to increase the FadL and FadD   expression?
Fig 1. Methodoly to overexpression of FadD and FadL   genes.  At first we cloned all required biobrick in E. coli DH10B to   make a stock and then we started the digestions and ligations.   We started did  the promoters (BBa_I719005/ BBa_I14018/   BBa_R0040) digest with PstI and XbaI and the RBS (BBa_B0034)   digestion with SpeI and EcoRI. After that we did gel purified   of both parts and then did these two parts ligation, so,  we gel   purified again and ligate this with a plasmid (PBS1C3) digested   with PstI and EcoRI. We did the same way to ligate the FadD   coding (BBa_K1076003) or FadL coding (BBa_K1076005) with   terminators (BBa_B0015/ BBa_B0010) . After all these steps, we   digest the PSB1C3+Promoter+RBS with PstI an XbaI and digest   the PSB1C3+Coding+terminator with SpeI and EcoRI and did that   ligation and then ligate this ligation in a PSB3C5 digested with PstI   and EcoRI and now our vectors are building, how you can see in   the figure 1 and 2.
Fig 2. Sequencing construction of to FadD   overexpression with 4 diferents promoter(all these   contrusction are insert in PSB3C5 plasmid), to compare the   best  expression result in Shewanella putrefaciens.

Sequencing construction of to FadL   overexpression with 4 diferents promoter(all these   contrusction are insert in PSB3C5 plasmid), to compare the   best  expression result in Shewanella putrefaciens.  And after that we transform these plasmid in S. Putrefaciens   and observed  which  contrution is better to increase the beta   oxidation pathway.
