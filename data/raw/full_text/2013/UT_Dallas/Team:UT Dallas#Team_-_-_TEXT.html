Alec Spinhirne
I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering.
Because I'm a natural born leader,  I was destined to take command of this great team.
I enjoy wearing cowboy boots 24/7 and my teammates have been
known to count the number of sighs I make. -sigh-
I <3 Texas!
Lana Khazma
I am a sophomore Molecular Biology major, and I have definitely
learned a lot this summer on the iGEM team! I have become a master at
html coding and now all my teammates bow down to my powers.
Aside from a series of sleepless nights, I have realized my true passions
this summer: tumblr, eating, sleeping, and pizza.
Martin Savard-Rosas
My hobbies include rock climbing, watching movies, and playing
football. I am Canadian and I love maple butter (whatever that is).
When in Canada, I plan on spending my time at the local Costco.
I have learned from my iGem team that it is unacceptable
to wear white socks with black shoes.
Janice Chuang
I’m a biology junior and I enjoy napping, making sushi for the whole team,
and I am excellent at drawing puppies and teeth. Also, I am loved on the team
because I bring fresh muffins, donuts, and ice cream for those late nights in lab.
I am the team chauffeur that drives the members to local restaurants when in
desperate need of a break!
Samantha Preisser
I am a Senior Biochemistry major working on a Spanish minor.
My hobbies include cooking and hanging out with my cat, Odin.
I am the president of the UTD Comet Cat Coalition.
I love Oregon and spending time outdoors!
I make a mean tuna casserole and have introduced cotton candy
grapes to the team. They taste like the real thing!
Elise Bullock
I also enjoy cats, especially my kitten Haley. I am
excellent at speed (the card game). I am the resident genius
with the ability to solve any problem and to read any illegible
handwriting. After an exhausting and long day in lab, I like to
watch football and baseball- Go Rangers!
Tracy Truong
I’m a biochemistry sophomore. I am known for my complete awesomeness,
and I have the grace of a gazelle, the speed of a cheetah, and the strength of a
really strong animal. I'm a master at t-shirt designing as well, and I am
always prepared with snacks in case someone throws a fit.
Rashed Rihani
I'm a sophomore Biomedical Engineering major.
I definitely enjoyed being a part of iGEM, and it truly
has been an eye opening experience. I am known for my
killer good looks that can kill bacteria on the spot!
My hobbies include volunteering, studying, and video games.
Matthew Lantz
I'm a "fun-guy". But really, I’m known around on the streets for my
legendary banana bread. Also, I provide board games and cards as we’re
waiting for our PCR or ligation. Since I am a certified giant, I am assigned
the task of getting all the supplies for the shorter members.
