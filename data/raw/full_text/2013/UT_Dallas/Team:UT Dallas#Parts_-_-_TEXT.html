BBa_K1214011
Composite
pFru-RBS-GFP, Fructose operon promoter with GFP coding sequence downstream. Constitutively expresses GFP. Regulated by fructose operon repressor FruR (BBa_K1214008)
Alec Spinhirne
976
BBa_K1214012
Composite
pScr-RBS-GFP, Sucrose operon promoter with GFP coding sequence downstream. Should constitutively express GFP. Regulated by ScrR (BBa_K1214005)
Alec Spinhirne
888
BBa_K1214013
Composite
Promoter-RBS-FruR, Constitutive promoter with fructose operon repressor downstream. Should constitutively express FruR (BBa_K1214008)
Alec Spinhirne
1070
BBa_K1214014
Composite
Promoter-RBS-ScrR, Constitutive promoter with sucrose operon repressor downstream. Should constitutively express ScrR
Alec Spinhirne
 
BBa_K1214015
Composite
Promoter-RBS-FruR-TT-pFru-RBS-GFP, Constitutive promoter with fructose operon repressor downstream. Should repress pFru when fructose is not present. When fructose is added to system, GFP should be expressed

BBa_K1214016
Coding
RBS-NspC, Encodes for NspC. Expression should lead to the synthesis of norspermidine, an aid in breaking down biofilms
