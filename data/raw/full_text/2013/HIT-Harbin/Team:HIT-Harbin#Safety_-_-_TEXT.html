Safety
1.Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No risk. All that we use in our lab are harmless to workers under normal conditions. Once we finished our experiment, all wares we used would be sterilized in high temperature, then we would discard waste in waste bins designated for our iGEM lab, and we would wear gloves when we washed wares.
2.Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No risk. Our biological materials cannot prevail in natural environment because of their special requirements of cultivation and competitions between microorganisms.
3.Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No risk. Our biological materials cannot prevail in natural environment because of their special requirements of cultivation and competitions between microorganisms.
4.Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No risk. Our biological materials have no latent menace more than general biological materials.
5.If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
No risk. Our project is friendly to public and environment.
6.Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
No, because simple processes, such as sterilizing, can solve the safety problems. Even if we do nothing, the bacteria we use will die due to lack of nutrition, before they propagate.
7.What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
We received safety training about the self-protection, experimental rules, and methods under emergent conditions.
8.Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
Yes, our institution has the committee that establish guidelines and policies on biosafety. Evaluation of biosafety are regularly carried out, including evaluation of research proposals and monitoring of experimental procedures.
9.Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
