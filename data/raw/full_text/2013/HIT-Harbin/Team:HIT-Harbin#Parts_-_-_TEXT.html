Sequence optimization was done using JCat(Java Codon Adaptation Tool)[1] developed by  Andreas Grote
CODON OPTIMIZATION FOR HRPS AND HRPR GENE
Figure1: Codon Adaptation of hrpS gene in E.coli before optimization
CAI-Value of the sequence before optimization:0.2736.    GC-Content of the sequence before optimization:59.17%
Figure2: Codon Adaptation of hrpS gene in E.coli after optimization
CAI-Value of the optimized sequence:0.9832    GC-Content of the optimized sequence:53.60%
Figure3: Codon Adaptation of hrpR gene in E.coli before optimization
CAI-Value of the sequence before optimization:0.2490.    GC-Content of the sequence before optimization:57.70
Figure4: Codon Adaptation of hrpR gene in E.coli after optimization
CAI-Value of the optimized sequence:0.9721.    GC-Content of the optimized sequence:53.69%
