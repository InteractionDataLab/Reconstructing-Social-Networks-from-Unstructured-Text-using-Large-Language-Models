Use of Ubiquitin as a Mechanism for MHC Class I Presentation
Ubiquitin is a small 8.5 kDa regulatory protein. It is post-translationally added to substrate proteins, signaling protein lysis, protein localization, or activation/inhibition of protein function. In the future, we plan to create a fusion protein of FluM1 and MelanA pathogenic antigens with ubiquitin, signaling endocytosis and viral budding of the our antigen, leading to cytotoxic T cell response.
Dendritic Cell Targeting via aDEC-205 ScFv
The ant-DEC205 single chain variable fragment is an antibody fragment that binds to the DEC205 surface protein on dendritic cells. We plan to express this scFv on the surface of our vaccine chassis using a surface anchor protein, such as ice nucleation protein, to increase its affinity for dendritic cell targeting and uptake.
