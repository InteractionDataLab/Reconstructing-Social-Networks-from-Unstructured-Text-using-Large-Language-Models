May: Week 1
First ASU iGEM 2013 with new team members
Introduction to the competition, registration logistics, summer schedules
Idea Brainstorming
Review of biobrick cloning, Golden Gate assembly, safety training
Week 2
Idea Brainstorming--narrowed down to two project ideas
Safety Training:
Biosafety and Bloodborne Pathogens
Lab Safety
Fire Safety
Recombinant DNA Safety
Hazardous Waste Management
June: Week 3
Started making amp plates in preparation for experimentation
Week 4
Started growing up colonies of E. coli K12 MG1655, BL21 (DE3),and N10 B strains along with glycerol stocks
Performed a restriction, ligation and transformation of the three plasmids and grew them up on a plate
No colony growth of any of the plasmids
Week 5
Performed a PCR amplification of the cadA promoter along with a gel screen that found the band at the appropriate band length
Transformed and plated both J61100 and E1010 with no growth on either plates
Gel screen of yebF without the stop codon never showed up on the gel. Ran transformation again.
Restricted and ligated cadA and BN promoters
Week 6
The gel screen of yebF without the stop codon was finally successful
Transformation of INPNC-MCS and RFP control onto N10B cells was successful
No growth from transformation of E0020, E0030, and E0040
Created liquid cultures of E0240 and pCadA in LB Chloro.
July: Week 7
Performed restriction digest of pCadA, pBN, and YebF
Performed seven different ligations
Miniprepped and nanodropped E0240 and pCadA.
Miniprepped YebF+GMCSF and PelB leader sequence.
Flow cytometry indicated that there was no GFP
Transformed J23100 yet no plate growth
Week 8
Ordered Antigen primers
Ligation and transformation of PelB+GMCSF+pSB1C3/4K5
Miniprep showed no successful ligation and transformation
Week 9
PCR of MelanA and Flu M1 worked via confirmation from gel screen
Nissle would not grow
Transformed I13522 into N10B on LB Amp
August: Week 11
Grew up six cultures of ligations
Miniprepped the PSB1c3 backbone and grew up additional backbone in cultures
Transformed the GFP and GMCSF in the backbone
Ran LLO pcr on gel and all had correct band lengths
September: Week 15
Made ligations of FLU+1c3, MelA+1c3, Flu+J04..., MelA+J04...
Made liquid cultures of non-red colonies from FLU+1c3, MelA+1c3, Flu+J04..., MelA+J04 transformation
Biobricks made and sent: LLO with promoter RBS, YEb-GMCSF, GMCSF, FLU1, and MelanA
