E. coli Nissle 1917
E. coli Nissle 1917 is a lowly-immunogenic strain of Escherichia coli used in commercial probiotics, such as Mutaflor. The ASU iGEM team aims to port our final vaccine construct into Nissle for safe use as a vaccine delivery vector. Because Nissle has properties that make it lowly immunogenic, it serves as a stronger candidate for a vaccine vector compared to current chassis, such as Salmonella and Listeria, because it is less likely to trigger an immune response to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the bacteria itself.
E. coli NEB10 Beta
The ASU iGEM Team used E. coli NEB10 Beta cells for all dendritic cell experimentation. To ensure that dendritic cells could take up E. coli, the team transformed E. coli with GFP and observed dendritic cell uptake of the bacteria to support the notion of using E. coli as an effective cancer vaccine vector.

Brighter green dendritic cells indicate uptake of GFP E. coli and thus effective use of the E. coli chassis as an antigen delivery vector.
