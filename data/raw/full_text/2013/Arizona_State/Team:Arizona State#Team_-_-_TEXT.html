Team
Meet the Devils
Abhinav Markus, Senior Biomedical Engineering major, is the T cell receptor of the team. He recognizes good pathogenic antigen (biobricks) when he sees them.
Nisarg Patel, Senior in Molecular Biology, is the nucleus of the team. He knows where all our DNA is and he monitors production of biobrick genes.
Hyder Hussain, a senior in Computational Math, Hyder is the protein kinase of the team. He makes sure all of our genetic and cellular processes run smoothly and efficiently.
Julia Smith, Senior in Biomedical Engineering, is the 5-HT serotonin receptor of the team. She makes sure team moral is high and the team is motivated.
Nathan Palmer, a sophomore in Molecular Biology, is the MHC class 1 pathway of the team. He presents data for scientists to recognize and approve.
Rohit Rajan, Junior in Biochemistry, is E.coli's Yeb secretion tag of the team. He oozes awesomeness and, making the ASU iGEM team just that much better.
Ryan Muller, Junior majoring in Biochemistry, is the ribosome of the team. He ''translates'' biobrick genes (in E.coli of course!), to generate characterization data.
Joseph (Joe) Yun, a senior in Molecular Biology, is the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor of the team. He promotes growth and develop of the team.
