In addition to curating public feedback on our initial design, we interviewed multiple cancer researchers at ASU and Mayo Clinic physicians to determine the optimal strategy for vaccine chassis design and the most effective components of vaccination essential to an effective immune response, including:
GM-CSF expresion and secretion.
Utilization of a lowly-immunogenic bacterial vaccine strain to minimize destruction of the chassis before vaccine delivery.
Designing the vaccine to be utilized as a prophylactic rather than as a therapeutic.
Listeriolysin O expression for MHC Class I protein presentation.
We then met with these experts again following our revised experimental design to confirm their feedback.
