Our Generous Sponsors
All of the Clemson iGEM team’s work for this year’s competition has been made possible by the generous contributions from our sponsors: the Clemson University Department of Biological Sciences, the Clemson University Creative Inquiry program, New England BioLabs, SnapGene, Promega, Qiagen, and Integrated DNA Technologies. We are particularly grateful for the support given by the Clemson University Department of Biological Sciences and the Clemson University Creative Inquiry program.
