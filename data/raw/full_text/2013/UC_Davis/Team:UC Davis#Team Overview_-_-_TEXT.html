Welcome to The UC Davis iGEM Team
This year we put  together a small team of cross-disciplinary undergraduates to tackle our iGEM project. This group has worked hard over the past months to bring their idea for combining TAL repressor proteins and riboswitches to yield a novel device for modular expression control. Our experienced group of faculty and graduate advisors have supported the team with valuable guidance.
