The Depot
Initial Population of The Depot
Teams ZJU-China, UCSF, Stanford-Brown, and Bielefeld-Germany collaborated with our team in an effort to see how our promoter characterization standards worked in practice by further characterizing the Anderson Promoter Collection (J23100-J23119). This collaborative effort taught new and verified many important facets in making data standards: how to communicate in a common vocabulary in a global environment, to weave in standardization with the already strict timetables of iGEM teams, and to understand what components of the characterization process can be standardized. Most importantly, however, this process showed iGEM-er's eagerness to share. Check out the results of this collaborative efforts at The Depot.
