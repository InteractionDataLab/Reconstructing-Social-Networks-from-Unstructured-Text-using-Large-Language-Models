Our best characterized parts are our RiboTAL constructs, which consist of parts BBa_K1212011-BBa_K1212016. Among these parts, most of characterization was focused on the riboswitch+TAL constructs (BBa_K1212011, BBa_K1212012, BBa_K1212014, BBa_K1212015), as the other parts were simply pTet+GFP, which are already well characterized parts, with some extra base pairs added for our TAL binding sites (BBa_K1212013, BBa_K1212016). Both our pSB3K3 backbone (BBa_K1212002) and our GFP (BBa_K1212006) with their BsaI sites fixed were used in our RiboTAL constructs and functioned as expected but did not need separate characterization. The pBAD+Riboswitch+GFP parts (BBa_K1212009 and BBa_K1212010) were originally planned for testing our riboswitches in case the RiboTAL constructs were not working. Since the RiboTALs did work as expected, we focused on characterizing the RiboTALs over the riboswitch testing constructs.
Project Overview
Learn about how we combine riboswitches and TALs into robust orthogonal mechanisms for     inducible repression.
Results
Check out the cool results of our experiments with RiboTALs.
Human Practices
Take a look at how we promote sharing in iGEM through The Depot, an open BioBrick characterization database.
