Human Practices
BioBrick Characterization Data Depot
Sharing is what makes us human, but as synthetic biologists, how can we improve the ways we share with each other? Find out more at the Data Depot
Outreach
Provided DNA extractions for E.coli expressing RFP for the biotechnology class at Davis Senior High School
Hosted the NorCal iGEM team meet-up at UC Davis with the UC Berkeley, UCSF and Stanford-Brown teams attending
Worked with classmate Nicholas Armstrong to create a Synthetic Biology Club at UC Davis
Project Overview
Learn about how we combine riboswitches and TALs into robust orthogonal mechanisms for     inducible repression.
Results
Check out the cool results of our experiments with RiboTALs.
Human Practices
Take a look at how we promote sharing in iGEM through The Depot, an open BioBrick characterization database.
