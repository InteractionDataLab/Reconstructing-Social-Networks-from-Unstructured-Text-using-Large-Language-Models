The Depot
Standards in the Depot
Although there have been differing methods of characterizing Biobricks, the vast majority of characterizations use the measurement of fluorescence and cell density in a microplate reader. The standards can accommodate some other types of characterizations, but are best suited to report data as described.
Additionally, The Depot defines an uploadable experiment as: empirical measurements of a response from a single part type in the same construct that are affected by the same set of user-controlled variables.
Uploading to The Depot requires the following:
1. The raw data file (.txt, .csv, .xls, .xlx) from the output of your machine. An example is shown here.
2. Standardized data file (csv) that reports your plate layout with information on how each well varies within the experiment. The linked tabular format that is partly shown here. Sheet two in the link contains a hypothetical example filled in.
3. Standardized data file (csv), that reports your measurements over time (ex: fluorescence, cell density, temperature) in the linked tabular format that is partly shown here. Sheet two in the link contains a hypothetical example filled in.
4. The metadata file (csv) that reports information on your experiment's conditions and settings in the linked tabular format that is fully shown here. Sheet two in the link contains a hypothetical example filled in.
The well-IDs follow the following naming system, where the columns are numbered and the rows are capitalized letters.
