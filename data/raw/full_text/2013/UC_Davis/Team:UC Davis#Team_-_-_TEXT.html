Aura Ferreiro
I am a 5th year undergraduate majoring in Biological Systems Engineering. I enjoy playing my ukulele and coming up with ways to integrate quinoa and tofu into every meal I cook. I plan to apply for graduate programs in the same field I study now, and look forward to a career in design and modeling of industrial biological systems, or of synthetic biological devices with commercial applications.
Amy Soon
I am a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and specializing in Systems and Synthetic Biology. Outside of school and the lab, I enjoy fantasy and mystery stories in tv shows, games or novels. I am still in the process of deciding on my future career path and whether I will go to graduate school directly after graduating or take some time off to get work experience first. I hope to be able to continue working with synthetic biology in a career in industry.
Alex Neckelmann
I am a Senior majoring in Biotechnology with an emphasis in microbiology and awesome. When I’m not at school, I enjoy playing tennis or reading biographies. I plan on graduating and applying to graduate school in the fall. After graduate school, I would really enjoy working on projects involved in bioremediation or optimizing industrial bioprocesses through synthetic biology.
David Hwang
Hi, I'm David Hwang, and I'm entering my fourth year as a Computer Science major this coming fall. My current professional interests are computer science applications in healthcare, education, and clearly, biology. My unprofessional interests are ultimate frisbee (I am on the school's club team where we placed in the top 8 in the nation this past year), and cooking.
Lucas Murray
Hi, I am a third year biomedical engineering major with an emphasis in systems and synthetic biology. When I'm not going back and forth between labs, I enjoy competitive sailing, freediving, and underwater photography. If I had free time, you'd find me doing any of those three. My main background is in instrumentation and chemistry, but my academic focus is on synthetic biology, biophysics, and molecular biology. I plan to apply to graduate school next fall, where I would like to continue to study synthetic biology.
