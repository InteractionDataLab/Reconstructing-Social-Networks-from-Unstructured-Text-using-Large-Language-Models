Making Chemically Competent Cells
Procedure
Prepare 0.5 M PIPES (pH 6.7) (piperazine-1,2-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid]) by dissolving 15.1 g of PIPES in 80 ml of pure H2O (Milli-Q, or equivalent). Adjust the pH of the solution to 6.7 with 5 M KOH, and then add pure H2O to bring the final volume to 100 ml. Sterilize the solution by filtration through a disposable pre-rinsed Nalgene filter (0.45-µm pore size). Divide into aliquots and store frozen at -20°C.         Prepare Inoue transformation buffer by dissolving all of the solutes listed below in 800 mL of pure H2O and then add 20 ml of 0.5 M PIPES (pH 6.7). Adjust the volume of the Inoue transformation buffer to 1 liter with pure H2O.

Add H2O to fill solution to 1 liter. Sterilize Inoue transformation buffer by filtration through a prerinsed 0.45-µm Nalgene filter. Divide into aliquots and store at -20°C.
Pick a single bacterial colony (2-3 mm in diameter) from a plate that has been incubated for 16-20 hours at 37°C. Transfer the colony into 25 ml of SOB medium (LB may be used instead) in a 250-ml flask. Incubate the culture for 6-8 hours at 37°C with vigorous shaking (250-300 rpm).
At about 6 o'clock in the evening, use this starter culture to inoculate three 1-liter flasks, each containing 250 ml of SOB. The first flask receives 10 ml of starter culture, the second receives 4 ml, and the third receives 2 ml. Incubate all three flasks overnight at 18-22°C with moderate shaking.
The following morning, read the OD600 of all three cultures. Continue to monitor the OD every 45 minutes.
When the OD600 of one of the cultures reaches 0.55, transfer the culture vessel to an ice-water bath for 10 minutes. Discard the two other cultures.
Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2500g (3900 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Pour off the medium and store the open centrifuge bottle on a stack of paper towels for 2 minutes. Use a vacuum aspirator to remove any drops of remaining medium adhering to walls of the centrifuge bottle or trapped in its neck.
Resuspend the cells gently in 80 ml of ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer.

Gel Extraction and Purification
Procedure
Prepare agarose gel (see gel electrophoresis) and use additional or larger combs to make larger wells.
Once the gel has run, use preferably a blue light lamp, or UV for a very short time (it will degrade your DNA), (in the dark, wearing goggles and skin protection) to identify bands.
Cut out the desired bands with a stamp pipette tip or clean razor and transfer to a clean tube.  The stamp pipette tip can be left in the tube to be cleaned out with a smaller pipette tip.
Weigh gel fragments and add 200 µL Buffer NTI for every 100 mg agarose gel.
Incubate sample for 5-10 min at 50º C, vortexing every 2-3 min until the gel is completely dissolved.

Primer Design for Site-Directed Mutagenesis PCR
Procedure
Identify site that needs to be mutated.
Check the amino acid sequence to create a silent mutation, generally the last base in a codon.
Check a codon usage table for your chassis to help choose how the codon should be changed, try to pick a frequently used codon.
Take about 20 base pairs upstream and 20 base pairs downstream of your desired mutation site to create your primer. The sequence should be identical to the template except for the one changed base you are trying to mutate at the center.
The reverse primer will be the reverse complement of this sequence.
