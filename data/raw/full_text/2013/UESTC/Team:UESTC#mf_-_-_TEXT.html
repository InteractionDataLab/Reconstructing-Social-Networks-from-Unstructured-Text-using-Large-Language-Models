Bronze Medal
1. Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
We registered our team as UESTC, enjoyed ourselves during summer and autumn, and spent most of our           time learning, sharing and working in the room 341 of Yifu Building. For more information about our           team, please visit our wiki or our team video on YouTube.
2. Create and share a description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.
For overview of our projects, please click here .
To see details of Nebula, please click here .
To see details of Transpeeder, please click here .
3. Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We made our Poster and will give a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
4. Develop and make available via the The Registry of Software Tools an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on BioBrick standard biological parts.
Our software tools and source code are now available on Github for free downloads, please click here to download.
Silver Medal
1. Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool.
For next version of our project, please see our future work page.
For Nebula, please click here .
For Transpeeder, please click here .
2. Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.
Our second software is Transpeeder, a distinct yet complementary one. For more details, please click here .
3. Provide a demonstration of their software either as a textual or video tutorial made available on their wiki. This tutorial should explain all the features of the tool as well as provide sample input and output as appropriate.
To see textual tutorial of our projects, please visit our page on github to download tutorial: https://github.com/igemsoftware/UESTC2013
Also video tutorial is available on YouTube.

Gold Medal
1. Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained.
Our software, Nebula, has been used by team UESTC_Life . The project of UESTC_Life is to constitute a device that can clear the pollution of environment. To find out suitable promoters that can be stimulated by arabinose, the proper CDS and other reliable components, like terminator and RBS, they used the Auto Mode of Nebula which can generate reliable devices with the inducer and output that users designate. Although to accomplish the function of their projects, team UESTC_Life used CDS that is not in the official registry, which is not provided in our database, they used other parts that our software, Nebula, provides.
2. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
For details about this topic, please visit our human practice page, click here .
3. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
Among our three projects, both iBricks and Nebula provides sharing function for users. In Nebula, once you complete your designs, you can share the information of your devices as pictures with your friends via Twitter. In iBricks, if you like this video game, you can share it with your friends via Twitter or Facebook, you make an effort to popularize the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM as well.
