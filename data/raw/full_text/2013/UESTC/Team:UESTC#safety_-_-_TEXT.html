Safety
1. Are you using the iGEM Software repository at github.com/igemsoftware? If you have instead stored your code elsewhere, please explain where and why you have put it there. If your code is not in the iGEM repository, are you using any version control system such as Git, CVS, or SVN?
Yes, we are using the iGEM Software repository at github.com/igemsoftware.
2. User Data
a. Does your software store any private data supplied by the user? (For example: the user's name and email address, passwords, DNA sequences, circuit designs, etc.) If yes, please describe what kind of data is stored. If no, skip the rest of this question and move on to question 3.
Yes, users can store their circuit designs in our software.
b. What is the URL or IP address where the user's private data is stored? Where is the physical computer or hard drive that contains the user's private data?
The users' private data is stored on his own hard drive for example iPhone. The hard drive belongs to the users so he can put it anywhere he likes.
c. Please describe any encryption, password protection, etc. that you use to protect the user's data. (It is not mandatory to have such protections, but if you do, describe them.)
No protection is provided.
3. Does your software include any other security features? Please describe them here.
No.
4. Does your software let the user create a design by choosing parts/genes from a list/database, such as the Registry? If so, which lists/databases are included? Is there any restriction on which parts/genes the user can choose?
Yes, users can choose parts to create a design from our own database. We reorganized the parts of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts released in 2013 and created a database. There is no restriction on choice.
5. Does your software allow users to write new data into any public lists or databases? If so, do you check the new data for errors before allowing it to be written?
We do not allow users to write new data.
6. Does your software include any other features that encourage the user to create safe designs? Please describe them here.
No other features.
7. Is your team also doing biological work in a wet lab?
Yes.
