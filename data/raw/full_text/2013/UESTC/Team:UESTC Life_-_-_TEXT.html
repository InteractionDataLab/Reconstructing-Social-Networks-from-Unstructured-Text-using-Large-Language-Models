Renowned as China's cradle for the national electronic industry, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (formerly Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering) is situated at Chengdu, the city of over a thousand-year-old cultural history in "the land of abundance".
Project
● Tow crude invaders, γ-HCH and TCP, occupied our beautiful homeland, people lived in hot water. ● When the key enzymes genes were transformed in our white fighter(E.coli), a pollution predator has been created. ● Those invaders died out in his stomach. The beautiful sky, clear water and health food returned to our life.
Project
●Project Overview ●Project Story ●Four Key Enzymes ●Strategy ●Reference More
Results and Discussion
● TCP Biodegradation Achieved ● γ-HCH Biodegradation and  F2A       Cleaving Achieved ● P2A Being an Excellent Linker in       Chimeric Protein ● Polycistronic Co-expression System       Constructed
Results and Discussion
● Vectors and Parts ● Future Work ● Achievement More
First Model
A graph shows how the experimental concentration changed with time goes by, and then comparing the theoretical curve with the curve gotten from experiment
More
Second Model
A mass of information about the influence of linkers’ structure and length were collected in the chimeric protein. And then we fitted a formula to predict the protein’s status as a linker by scoring it(with 10 a full marks).
