After having a meeting with our instructors and got an overview of the basics of synthetic biology. We did a survey of previous iGEM teams that got the Best Experimental Measurements award and read many papers. Base on the condition of our college and our expectation, we decided our project and create a schedule. Then we did some experiment technologies trainings, such as making gel, gel electrophoresis. </P><P><B>Jul 1st~Jul 8th ,</B>

The resulting vector S1 contains gene fragments of <I>LinA</I> and <I>LinB</I>, while vector S2 contains gene fragments of <I>DhaA</I> and <I>HheC</I>.(Fig.1) After digestion using Xbal and Xhol, the four genes were cloned into a modified pBAD expression vector pOHC_00, respectively, resulting in the following four vectors, POHC_01 (<I>LinA</I>), POHC_02 (<I>LinB</I>), POHC_03 (<I>DhaA</I>), POHC_04 (<I>HheC</I>). <I>E. coli</I> strain <I>DH5α</I> was used as a host cell.

From the gel ,we can see that F2A can cleave LinA and LinB,however ,P2A can’t work like that.</P><P><B>Jul 27th</B>
