Hello
This is the voice from UESTC, Chengdu, China. We are proud to announce that we have achieved two               first here: It‘s the first time that our university take part in iGEM. What’s more, we are also               the first team from the southwest region of China participating in the software competition. Wow!               We come from University of electronic science and technology of China, which is renowned as China's               cradle for the national electronic industry. Also, our university is situated in Chengdu, the city               of over a thousand-year-old cultural history in 'the land of abundance'. What's more, we are from               the hometown of PANDAs!

Hi, I am the leader of our team and the director of iBricks. As a junior student                              majoring in Biomedical Engineering, I have a great interest in data mining in social                              network and programming software on mobile devices. I did all the scoring algorithm of                              Nebula in our team.
Muruo Liu
Hi, I am a junior student from school of life science and technology, majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in English. For my great organizational capability,                               I am the director of Nebula. I am in charge of the statistics of parts in the registry                               and database established for Nebula.
Xiaonan Guo
Hi, I am a junior student majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I am fond of photography                               and sports, especially basketball. I did part of parts statistics and the realization                               of Transpeeder by Java.
Yingping Han
Hi, I am a junior student majoring in Biomedical Engineering with strong learning ability.                               I like running, reading and traveling around. I did part of parts statistics and kept the                                minutes of our discussion in our way to MIT. My life motto is nothing is impossible to a                                 willing heart.
Jurong Zhao
Hi, I am a junior student majoring in Biomedical Engineering with great interest in programming.                               I chose programming on IOS system as the main attack. iBricks is my first experience in video                                games. Programming Nebula on iPhone is relatively easy to me. My maxim is where there is a                                will, there is a way.
Wenpin Xiang
Hi, I am a sophomore majoring in Theoretical Physics from school of physical                                  electronics. I am regarded as a hard-working student with easy-going personality.                                  Making great videos is what I am always pursuing. Besides this, I also participated                                  in parts statistics work for our projects.
Guodong Zhu
Hi, I am a freshman from School of Information and Software Engineering, also a fantastic                               guy with passion and great imagination. Wiki is rather a great challenge for me, but I                               really enjoy this process of learning and progressing. The realization of online version                               of Nebula is also my work.
