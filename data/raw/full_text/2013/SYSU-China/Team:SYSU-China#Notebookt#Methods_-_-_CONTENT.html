Methods
</H1><H2> 
Introduction
</H2><P> Our experiments can be divided into two parts, one is the design and construction of genes and vectors, the other is test of parts and circuits with cells, including hepatoma cells, liver cells and iPSCs. So our protocol can be clearly be divided into these two parts, one for molecular operation, the other for cellular tests. Besides, quantitive measurement, like qPCR and western-blotting, is added in the molecular operation parts because it does not need cell operation.
</P><H2> 
Molecular Operation
</H2><P>&lt; In the process of constructing circuit on vectors, PCR, PCR clean up, digestion of restriction endonuclease, gel extraction, ligation, transformation, colony PCR and plasmid extraction is implemented. Besides, for quantitive measurement, qPCR and western-blotting is used..</P><P><STRONG> PCR

Introduction
</STRONG></P><P>
Culturing human and pluripotent stem cells requires the use of complex media and careful handling techniques. Here, we describe feeder-free and serum free way with the use of Gibco Essential 8 medium in combination with BD matrigel low growth factor to maintain and propagate high quality hIPSCs.</P><P>The following protocol are modified from standard protocols from BD and Gibco </P><P><STRONG>
Materials required
</STRONG></P><P>
Essential 8 medium, consisting of DMEM/F12(AM)1:1 and Essential 8 Supplement(50*)</P><P>
0.5M EDTA, pH8.0</P><P>
37°C water bath</P><P>
BD matrigel low growh factor and Gibco knockout MEM</P><P>
DPBS without Calcium and Magnesium</P><P>
Approprate tissue culture plates and supplies</P><P><STRONG> Preparing Media and Materials
</STRONG></P><P><STRONG> Essential 8 Medium (500 mL of complete medium) 
</STRONG></P><P>
1.  Thaw Essential 8 Supplement (50X) at 2–8°C overnight instead of at 37°C. </P><P>
2.  Mix the following component into 500 mL of complete Essential 8 Medium s: </P><P>
DMEM/F-12 (HAM) 1:1            490 mL </P><P>
Essential 8  Supplement (50X)      10 mL </P><P>
Note: Before use, warm complete medium at room temperature until it is no longer cool to the touch. Do not warm the medium at 37°C.  </P><P><STRONG>0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS (50 mL)
</STRONG></P><P>
1.  To prepare 50 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS Mix the following components in a 50-mL conical tube in a biological safety cabinet to prepare 50 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS: </P><P>
DPBS without Calcium and Magnesium   50 mL </P><P>
0.5 M EDTA                         50 µL </P><P>
2.  Filter sterilize the solution. The solution can be stored at room temperature for up to six months. </P><P><STRONG> Coating Culture Vessels with BD matrigel with low growth factor
</STRONG></P><P>
BD Matrigel low growth factor Matrix should be aliquoted and frozen. Consult the Certificate of Analysis supplied with the BD Matrigel™ for the recommended aliquot size (“Dilution Factor”) to make up 25 mL of diluted matrix. Make sure to always keep BD Matrigel on ice when thawing and handling to prevent it from gelling. </P><P>
Note: Use tissue culture-treated cultureware (e.g. 6-well plates, BD Catalog #353046). </P><P>
1.  Thaw one aliquot of BD Matrigel on ice. </P><P>
2.  Dispense 25 mL of cold dilution medium (DMEM/F-12; Catalog #36254) into a 50 mL conical tube and keep on ice. </P><P>
3.  Add thawed BD Matrigel to the cold dilution medium (in the 50 mL tube) and mix well. The vial may be washed with cold medium if desired. </P><P>
4.  Immediately use the diluted BD Matrigel solution to coat tissue culture-treated cultureware. for recommended coating volumes.  </P><P><STRONG> Passaging iPSCs
</STRONG></P><P>
In general, split cells when one of the following occurs: </P><P>
•  PSC colonies are becoming too dense or too large.  </P><P>
•  PSC colonies are showing increased differentiation. </P><P>
•  The colonies cover approximately 85% of the surface area of the culture vessel, usually every 4 days. Even if the colonies are sparse and small, it is important to split the culture every 4 to 5 days. </P><P>
The split ratio can vary, though it is generally between 1:2 and 1:4 for early passages and between 1:3 and </P><P>
1:12 for established cultures. Occasionally, cells will grow at a different rate and the split ratio will need to be adjusted.  </P><P>
•  A general rule is to observe the last split ratio and adjust the ratio according to the appearance of the PSC colonies. If the cells look healthy and colonies have enough space, split using the same ratio. If they are overly dense and crowding, increase the ratio. If the cells are sparse, decrease the ratio.  </P><P><STRONG> Passaging PSC Colonies using EDTA
</STRONG></P><P>
Note: Newly derived PSC lines may contain a fair amount of differentiation through passage 4. It is not necessary to remove differentiated material prior to passaging. By propagating/splitting the cells the overall culture health should improve throughout the early passages. </P><P>
1.  Prior to starting, equilibrate your matrigel coated dishes to room temperature in the hood (this takes about one hour). Pre-warm the required volume of Essential 8 Medium at room temperature until it is no longer cool to the touch. </P><P>
Note: Do not warm medium in a 37°C water bath. </P><P>
2.  Aspirate the spent medium from the vessel containing PSCs with a Pasteur pipette, and rinse the vessel twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) without Calcium and Magnesium. Refer to Table 2 for the recommended volumes. </P><P>
3.  Add 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS to the vessel containing PSCs. Adjust the volume of EDTA for various dish sizes (refer to Table 2). Swirl the dish to coat the entire cell surface. </P><P>
4.  Incubate the vessel at room temperature for 5–8 minutes or 37°C for 4–5 minutes. When the cells start to separate and round up, and the colonies will appear to have holes in them when viewed under a microscope, they are ready to be removed from the vessel. </P><P>
Note: In larger vessels or with certain cell lines, this may take longer than 5 minutes. </P><P>
5.  Aspirate the EDTA solution with a Pasteur pipette.  </P><P>
6.  Add pre-warmed complete Essential 8 Medium to the dish. </P><P>
7.  Remove the cells from the well(s) by gently squirting medium and pipetting the colonies up using a 5-mL glass pipette. Avoid creating bubbles. Collect cells in a 15-mL conical tube. </P><P>
For 6-well plate, 1ml/well 0.5nM EDTA in DPBS is used to digest cells and 2ml/well complete Essential 8 Medium is used for culturing. </P><P>
Note: Do not scrape the cells from the dish. There may be obvious patches of cells that were not dislodged and left behind. Do not attempt to recover them through scraping. </P><P>
Note: Little or no extra pipetting is required to break up cell clumps after EDTA treatment. </P><P>
Note: Depending upon the cell line, work with no more than one to three wells at a time, and work quickly to remove cells after adding Essential 8 Medium to the well(s). The initial effect of the EDTA will be neutralized quickly by the medium. Some lines re-adhere very rapidly after medium addition, and must be removed 1 well at a time. Others are slower to re-attach, and may be removed 3 wells at a time. </P><P>
8.  Aspirate residual matrigel solution from the pre-coated dish. </P><P>
9.  Add an appropriate volume of pre-warmed Essential 8 Medium to each well of a coated 6-well plate so that each well contains 2 mL medium after the cell suspension has been added. Refer to Table 2 for volumes for other culture vessels. </P><P>
10.  Move the vessel in several quick figure eight motions to disperse cells across the surface of the vessels. </P><P>
11.  Place dish gently into the 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator and incubate the cells overnight. </P><P>
12.  Feed PSC cells beginning the second day after splitting. Replace spent medium daily. </P><P>
Note: It is normal to see cell debris and small colonies after passage.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="address"><P>Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China</P><P>Address: 135# Xingang Rd.(W.), Haizhu Guangzhou, P.R.China</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
