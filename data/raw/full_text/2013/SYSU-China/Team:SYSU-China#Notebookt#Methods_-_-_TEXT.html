Methods
Introduction
Our experiments can be divided into two parts, one is the design and construction of genes and vectors, the other is test of parts and circuits with cells, including hepatoma cells, liver cells and iPSCs. So our protocol can be clearly be divided into these two parts, one for molecular operation, the other for cellular tests. Besides, quantitive measurement, like qPCR and western-blotting, is added in the molecular operation parts because it does not need cell operation.
Molecular Operation

Digestion of restriction endonuclease
NEB, Fermentas and Takara restriction enzymes are used. Before use, check the proper buffer for the enzyme, if the activity is low, add twice the amount but prevent the enzyme volume more than 10%, or star activity may rise.

6. Plate all of the bug suspensions onto one LB(Amp+) plate. Mark the name of the plate and put it into 37°C incubator for 14-18h.
Colony PCR
Just like PCR protocol, but use takara rTaq enzyme.
Plasmid Extraction
Use Omega Endo-free kit for the plasmids for cell.
Use Anxygen Plasmid miniprep kit for plasmids for molecular cloning.
Follow the protocals provided in the kit. But a 65°C elutent can cause higher efficiency.
Cellular tests
In the process of cellular tests, transient transfection, virus package, selecting stable cell line are included.
Transient transfection
1. Seed cells a night before.
2. Refresh medium right before transduction. Cell density should be around 60% at the time of transduction.
3. For a single well in a 12-well plate, dilute 1.5ug plasmid DNA in 100ul opti-MEM and then add 4ul PEI.
4. Gently mix and then incubate for 20min.

2. refresh medium right before transduction. Cell density should be 40% at the time of transduction.
3. For a single well in a 6-well plate, dilute totally 3ug plasmids in 100 ul CaCl2,gently mix.We use PCGP/VSVG to package retrovirus and PSPAX2/MD2G to package lentivirus.
4. Add the mixture to 100ul BBS carefully and incubate for 20min.
5. Add the mixture to the cells and refresh after 6-8h.

Selecting stable cell line

4. Three later, refresh culture medium and passage cells into new plates.
Basic cell culturing
Medium: 10% FBS+ 88% DMEM (high-glucose)+1% P/S (5000 mg/ml penicillin and 5000 mg/ml streptomycin)+1% L-glutamine (200 mM). Cells were passaged with 0.25%Trypsin.
hiPSC culturing
Introduction
Culturing human and pluripotent stem cells requires the use of complex media and careful handling techniques. Here, we describe feeder-free and serum free way with the use of Gibco Essential 8 medium in combination with BD matrigel low growth factor to maintain and propagate high quality hIPSCs.
The following protocol are modified from standard protocols from BD and Gibco
Materials required
Essential 8 medium, consisting of DMEM/F12(AM)1:1 and Essential 8 Supplement(50*)
0.5M EDTA, pH8.0
37°C water bath
BD matrigel low growh factor and Gibco knockout MEM
DPBS without Calcium and Magnesium
Approprate tissue culture plates and supplies
Preparing Media and Materials
Essential 8 Medium (500 mL of complete medium)
1.  Thaw Essential 8 Supplement (50X) at 2–8°C overnight instead of at 37°C.
2.  Mix the following component into 500 mL of complete Essential 8 Medium s:
DMEM/F-12 (HAM) 1:1            490 mL
Essential 8  Supplement (50X)      10 mL
Note: Before use, warm complete medium at room temperature until it is no longer cool to the touch. Do not warm the medium at 37°C.
0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS (50 mL)
1.  To prepare 50 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS Mix the following components in a 50-mL conical tube in a biological safety cabinet to prepare 50 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS:
DPBS without Calcium and Magnesium   50 mL
0.5 M EDTA                         50 µL
2.  Filter sterilize the solution. The solution can be stored at room temperature for up to six months.
Coating Culture Vessels with BD matrigel with low growth factor
BD Matrigel low growth factor Matrix should be aliquoted and frozen. Consult the Certificate of Analysis supplied with the BD Matrigel™ for the recommended aliquot size (“Dilution Factor”) to make up 25 mL of diluted matrix. Make sure to always keep BD Matrigel on ice when thawing and handling to prevent it from gelling.
Note: Use tissue culture-treated cultureware (e.g. 6-well plates, BD Catalog #353046).
1.  Thaw one aliquot of BD Matrigel on ice.
2.  Dispense 25 mL of cold dilution medium (DMEM/F-12; Catalog #36254) into a 50 mL conical tube and keep on ice.
3.  Add thawed BD Matrigel to the cold dilution medium (in the 50 mL tube) and mix well. The vial may be washed with cold medium if desired.
4.  Immediately use the diluted BD Matrigel solution to coat tissue culture-treated cultureware. for recommended coating volumes.
Passaging iPSCs
In general, split cells when one of the following occurs:
•  PSC colonies are becoming too dense or too large.
•  PSC colonies are showing increased differentiation.
•  The colonies cover approximately 85% of the surface area of the culture vessel, usually every 4 days. Even if the colonies are sparse and small, it is important to split the culture every 4 to 5 days.
The split ratio can vary, though it is generally between 1:2 and 1:4 for early passages and between 1:3 and
1:12 for established cultures. Occasionally, cells will grow at a different rate and the split ratio will need to be adjusted.
•  A general rule is to observe the last split ratio and adjust the ratio according to the appearance of the PSC colonies. If the cells look healthy and colonies have enough space, split using the same ratio. If they are overly dense and crowding, increase the ratio. If the cells are sparse, decrease the ratio.
Passaging PSC Colonies using EDTA
Note: Newly derived PSC lines may contain a fair amount of differentiation through passage 4. It is not necessary to remove differentiated material prior to passaging. By propagating/splitting the cells the overall culture health should improve throughout the early passages.
1.  Prior to starting, equilibrate your matrigel coated dishes to room temperature in the hood (this takes about one hour). Pre-warm the required volume of Essential 8 Medium at room temperature until it is no longer cool to the touch.
Note: Do not warm medium in a 37°C water bath.
2.  Aspirate the spent medium from the vessel containing PSCs with a Pasteur pipette, and rinse the vessel twice with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) without Calcium and Magnesium. Refer to Table 2 for the recommended volumes.
3.  Add 0.5 mM EDTA in DPBS to the vessel containing PSCs. Adjust the volume of EDTA for various dish sizes (refer to Table 2). Swirl the dish to coat the entire cell surface.
4.  Incubate the vessel at room temperature for 5–8 minutes or 37°C for 4–5 minutes. When the cells start to separate and round up, and the colonies will appear to have holes in them when viewed under a microscope, they are ready to be removed from the vessel.
Note: In larger vessels or with certain cell lines, this may take longer than 5 minutes.
5.  Aspirate the EDTA solution with a Pasteur pipette.
6.  Add pre-warmed complete Essential 8 Medium to the dish.
7.  Remove the cells from the well(s) by gently squirting medium and pipetting the colonies up using a 5-mL glass pipette. Avoid creating bubbles. Collect cells in a 15-mL conical tube.
For 6-well plate, 1ml/well 0.5nM EDTA in DPBS is used to digest cells and 2ml/well complete Essential 8 Medium is used for culturing.
Note: Do not scrape the cells from the dish. There may be obvious patches of cells that were not dislodged and left behind. Do not attempt to recover them through scraping.
Note: Little or no extra pipetting is required to break up cell clumps after EDTA treatment.
Note: Depending upon the cell line, work with no more than one to three wells at a time, and work quickly to remove cells after adding Essential 8 Medium to the well(s). The initial effect of the EDTA will be neutralized quickly by the medium. Some lines re-adhere very rapidly after medium addition, and must be removed 1 well at a time. Others are slower to re-attach, and may be removed 3 wells at a time.
8.  Aspirate residual matrigel solution from the pre-coated dish.
9.  Add an appropriate volume of pre-warmed Essential 8 Medium to each well of a coated 6-well plate so that each well contains 2 mL medium after the cell suspension has been added. Refer to Table 2 for volumes for other culture vessels.
10.  Move the vessel in several quick figure eight motions to disperse cells across the surface of the vessels.
11.  Place dish gently into the 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator and incubate the cells overnight.
12.  Feed PSC cells beginning the second day after splitting. Replace spent medium daily.
Note: It is normal to see cell debris and small colonies after passage.
