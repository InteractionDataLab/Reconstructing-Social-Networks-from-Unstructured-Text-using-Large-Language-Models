Deathly hollows

These parts are the collections of suicide genes, which can kill a broad spectrum of cancer cells. That will be very useful in doing projects about cancer treatment. Besides, the part BBa_K1061006 is the hbax mutant, which can also kill yeast. And yeast is a very general chassis in synthetic biology. Then hbax will be very useful to construct the safety device in yeast.
Wands

These parts are  elements that control suicide gene expression in our work.  We named them "Wands", because they can control gene expression in a  robust and accurate way, just like a wand. With great power comes great responsibility, it is them to control the otherwise dangerous suicide genes in our project.And we think they have the ability to control other genes expression in other projects.
Expecto Patronum
BBa_K1061021
This part is the general safeguard device that may be used in gene therapy or cell therapy. It works through the action of the special gene, apoptin, which can specially kill cancer cells but leave the normal cells safe. It is a guardian angel, hence we call it "Expecto Patronum", inspired by the special curse in Harry Potter.
