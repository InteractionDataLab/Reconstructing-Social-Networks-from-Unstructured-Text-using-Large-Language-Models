Team:SYSU-China/Team/Member
From 2013.igem.org
ipsc
Team 2013 SYSU-CHINA is composed of 15 young members, all senior students from biology, biochemistry and mathematical science at Sun Yat-sen University. Forming on October 2012, this team has created the device called iPSCs Safeguard and partly tested it, and did several human practices.  A group of greenhands as we are, we cherish each mistake we've made, enjoy every moment we've spent together, and deeply appreciate every friend who has ever helped us!
Team Members
Sun Mengyi
He is the leader of the team. He played an important role in purposing the idea this year, and did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. A crazy nerd for science as he is, he reads a lot of books in different fields. His countless interesting stories about hundreds of scientists really broadened our horizons.
Zhao Yuchen
She is another leader of the team. She played an important role in perfecting this idea, and did most of our cell stable transfections in several cell lines, including iPS cells, Hep G2 cells, and hepatocytes. Besides the experiments, quarreling with Mengyi about the ideas and experiments and everything is another work she did everyday.
Chen Haoqi
He is the designer of most parts involving miRNA-122 and TRE elements. He did a lot of quantative work such as qRT-PCR and western blot. He also helped Yiming to accomplish the biobrick construction. Nice and gentle, he is absolutely the positive buffer of the team member relationship.
Lin Kaixuan
She did most of the transient infection experiments in cells, she tested each of our elements and got great data for modeling. Making a important contribution in designing the idea, she is also the professional writer of scientific articles, making our idea more clear and rigorous. she has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer for this project.
He Dawei
He is the designer of the tet system parts involving EF-1alpha , tTA and rtTA. He played an important role in discussion and designing of the idea this year. He also helped YiMing to accomplish the construction of biobricks. He is so shy that we never succeeded in catching a photo snapshot when he was looking at the camera.
Fang YiMing
He took part in constructing the part involving EF-1alpha, tTA and rtTA. He did the construction of biobrick. As the leader in Debate Team for more than three years, he is the trump card of our presentation.
Luo YingJie
She constructed some circuits involving TRE response element, and got important material for teams, like the plasmid involving TRE 3G. She had been actively involved in discussion about the idea.
Zheng Yuqing
She was the creator of most of the pictures, cartoon, flash and Powerpoint in this team. She magically turned our logo, wiki , poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts. She even kept drawing in the hospital, with her right hand, while her left hand was given an injection for her temperature as high as 39.4 degrees Celsius.
Fang Chao
He is our super boss for wiki on-line construction, poster design, logo design and badge design. All the beautiful team photos are taken by him. He is a lovely guy with a strong sense of humor. Watching him cooperating with Yuqing is one of most interesting thing in this world. Thank him for those delicious food he shared with us in those days.
Xie Tianyuan
She is a member from school of mathematical science and responsible for the modeling work. She is a hardworking and rigorous guy who builded the model of our project, providing us with a different view of science.
Yang Ziyi
Another member from shcool of mathematical science, he is a pretty shy and smart boy. Not mastering much knowledge about biology before, he quickly catched up with our design and finally offered us with a model which was totally beyond our expectation.
Ji Changyang
He made a huge contribution for idea discussion. He helped the teams in every aspect, including the design of wiki, the molecular works, and the logistics. He is also an activator of brainstorming. For many times, his warm temper eased the conflicts in the team discussing about ideas.
Yang Zongying
He is the steward of the team, solving the problems about fund and logistics. It is he who made us do our work without worrying about the other complicated but necessary things. He is absolutely the standard of "tall, rich and handsome".
Yao Runwen
He is a reliable assistant of cell work. He provided us with the most important paper that triggered others in the team to come up with the idea. Without his help, the isolation and primary culture of hepatocytes would hardly succeed. He will play an important role in next year’s competition. Besides, his outrageous high GPA is absolutely an positive energy for the whole team=.=.
Zhang Mingxuan
She is a reliable assistant of molecular cloning. She gave us constructive advices when we were facing problems. At spare time her hobby was laughing at our leader Mengyi, which became the funny drama for the rest of us. : ) She will play an important role in next year's competition.
Zeng Jianhua, Xie Yanwen, Tang Wei,
Zhao Xiaoyu ,Li  Luyao
They actively engaged in the discussion and brainstorming, and helped us a lot in Human Practice. They will also be the strong power of SYSU-iGEM next year.
Advisor
Jiang Shuai
He is our super advisor of the team. He provided us with firmly technical support about our experiment design. It is he who always couraged and helped us to overcome most of obstacles we've met in project. Without his professional knowledge and highly experimental skills about iPS, the experiments we did in mouse iPS and human iPS would be nothing but impossible. He made our idea more clear and beautiful.
Instructor
Lu Yongjun
He is one of the dean of School of Life Sciences. Our super boss. Our super funds supporter. :) He loves his students as his own children and makes SYSU-iGEM team become normalized. He's face, which is so similiar with Yamanaka's, also gave us a inspiration spark of our project idea this year: iPSC Safeguard. (Just kidding :D
Huang Junjiu
He is a young professor in Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory in Sun Yat-sen University. He offered us with most of the experimental spaces, equipment and materials. He also gave us a lot suggestions on our idea. Thank him for standing with his office in a total mess for such a long time because of us.
Xu Hui
He is both a young professor and a pre-father who provided us with a lot of experimental suggestions and materials such as Hep G2 cell lines and some essential plasmids. Due to his abundant knowledge of miRNA mechanism and molecular cloning, he gave us the most important suggest in constructing our circuit. Besides, it's very much likely that the day when we are in Hong Kong will be the day he finally turns into a happy father.
He Xionglei
A lovely and young professor of character. Always adored by us students for his special ideas, he added some creativity and great foresight to this team. His wonderful speech in our human practice talk gave everybody a deep impression.
