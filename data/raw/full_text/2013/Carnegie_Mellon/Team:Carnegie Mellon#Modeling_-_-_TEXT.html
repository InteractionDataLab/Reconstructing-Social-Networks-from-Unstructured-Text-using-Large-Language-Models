Modeling
We developed two models, each of which characterizes our experimental system on a different scale. The intracellular model uses chemical kinetics to model transcription and translation of the KillerRed gene, maturation of KillerRed, and the photochemistry of superoxide radical production.  The host-phage dynamics model examines the external interactions between E. coli and $\lambda$ and characterizes the effect of KillerRed (or control mRFP) on the system.
