Helping other iGEM teams
July 9-10th
The team participated in the development of new BioBrick part pages. The goal is to make part pages more uniform and parts better characterized. We videoconferenced with Purdue and several other teams to give feedback on the drafted data sheets and discuss other suggestions pertaining to the part pages and required data collection. This collaboration consisted of 79 teams form across the globe. For more information, see the Purdue Biomakers wiki .
