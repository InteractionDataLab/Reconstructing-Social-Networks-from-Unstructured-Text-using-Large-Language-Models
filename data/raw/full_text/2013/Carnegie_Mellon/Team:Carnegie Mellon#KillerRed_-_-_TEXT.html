KillerRed's structure, chemistry and biophysical properties

KillerRed is a red fluorescent protein that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of yellow-orange light (540-585 nm). KillerRed is engineered from anm2CP to be phototoxic. It has been shown that KillerRed produces superoxide radical anions by reacting with water. Superoxide reacts with the chromophore of KillerRed, causing it to become dark, which ultimately gives rise to a bleaching effect. KillerRed is spectrally similar to mRFP1 with a similar brightness. KillerRed is oligomeric and may form large aggregates in cells. Expression of KillerRed and irradiation with light may act as a kill-switch for biosafety applications.
The structure of KillerRed has been analyzed and the structural basis for its toxicity has been explored. The relevant PDB IDs are 2WIQ and 2WIS for the fluorescent and dark states, respectively.
The surface of KillerRed is predominantly negatively charged (indicated by red areas) as shown in Figures 3-6. The theoretical charge at pH 7.4 is approximately -13 (pI=5.1), which may play a role in its toxicity by interacting more closely with positively charged proteins and positively charged regions of proteins.

The interface between the homodimer includes a large network of hydrophobic interactions. This is a phenylalanine- and leucine-rich interface. The H148 residue forms two hydrogen bonds that "connect" the two backbones of the ß-barrels. The histidines and their hydrogen bonds are depicted in Figure 7.

KillerRed contains many sulfurous residues (10 methionines and 6 cysteines) to protect the protein against ROS damage2. Figure 8 depicts the homodimer with these residues visible.
Figure 8: The protein produces superoxide anion radicals, which can react with proteins and lipids to deactivate them. KillerRed contains many sulfurous residues (10 methionines and 6 cysteines) that can act as antioxidants. The large volume of the sulfur atom stabilizes the radical and prevents significant damage to the protein's backbone and side chains.2,3,4 PDB ID: 2WIQ
The superoxide anion radical is likely formed in this 8-membered water channel depicted in Figures 10 and 112. The carbonyl on the imidazole ring (Figure 9) hydrogen bonds with the water molecules and reacts with them when the π-electrons in the chromophore are excited. The lifetime of the fluorescence allows enough time for the reaction to occur and the superoxide to be produced2. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that fluorescent proteins are light-induced electron donors6, which would allow for the electron transfer to the water molecules, causing the superoxide to form. It has been shown that singlet oxygen is also produced by KillerRed, which was originally hypothesized to be the primary ROS produced1. More recent data suggests that superoxide is the primary ROS produced by KillerRed2,7. It is possible that triplet oxygen can enter the water channel and react in a similar manner to produce singlet oxygen via electron excitation by the chromophore2.
