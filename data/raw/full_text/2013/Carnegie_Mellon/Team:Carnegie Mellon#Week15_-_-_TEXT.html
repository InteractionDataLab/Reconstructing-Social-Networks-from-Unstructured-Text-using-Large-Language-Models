Thursday , September 19
Filled 96-well plate with 24 samples (two rows) each of KR and RFP plasmid and lysogen. One row of each exposed and unexposed. Exposed by doing 25 kinetic cycles on Tecan, 200 reads per cycle. Results inconclusive… protein may have been maturing during the experiment since cultures were induced the same day.
Friday, September 20
Reread plate which had been stored overnight at 4degC.
