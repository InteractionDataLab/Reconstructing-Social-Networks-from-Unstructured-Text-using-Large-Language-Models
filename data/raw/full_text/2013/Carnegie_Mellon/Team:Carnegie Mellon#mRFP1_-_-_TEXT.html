mRFP1 characterization
The QYG-derived chromophore of the mRFP1 protein. (Z)-2-(2-(4-amino-1-imino-4-oxobutyl)-4-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)acetic acid. The extended π-system is highlighted in red.
Characterization of the Photostability of mRFP1
Photobleaching curve of mRFP1 with a HBO100 mercury-arc lamp
XL10 Ultracompetent cells were transformed with <partinfo>BBa_E1010</partinfo> cloned with <partinfo>BBa_B0034</partinfo> as the RBS and <partinfo>BBa_R0010</partinfo> as the wild-type lac promoter and induced overnight with IPTG.The overnight was bleached for 180 minutes with HBO100 (100W Mercury-arc lamp). Fluorescence data was taken using a Tecan Safire II with the parameters shown in Table 3. Fluorescence values are shown in Table 4.
