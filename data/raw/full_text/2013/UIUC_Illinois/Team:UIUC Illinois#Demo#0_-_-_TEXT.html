Medal Requirements
This is the option currently being used. The Home and Medal req buttons are positioned at the top of the nav-bar, the problem is that when all tabs are closed, the links float up above the page =( I can make it so that you cannot close all tabs at once tho (so one tab would always be open and there wouldn't be the floating issue).
