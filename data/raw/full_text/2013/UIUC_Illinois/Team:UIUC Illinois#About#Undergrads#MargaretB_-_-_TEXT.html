Margaret Barbero
Maggie, born and raised in wild and wonderful West Virginia, was always at home in the forest. She’s happiest when halfway up a tree with the birds, but decided to try something new! Working in the lab, though less airy and spacious, has been an exhilarating challenge. Maggie is a sophomore majoring in Bioengineering, and is in love with biology. She wants to become a researcher influencing the future of medical science, making iGEM an ideal stepping stone. Even though she is very busy, she can always find time for chatting with some friends, enjoying a good Sherlock Holmes story or dancing to her favorite Spanish music. Her optimism and good cheer has found a fine home at UIUC and especially in our Wetlab iGEM team.
