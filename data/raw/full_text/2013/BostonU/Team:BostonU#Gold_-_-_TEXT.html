✓ Help a registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system - See our Collaborations page to read more about our collaborations with Wellesley Desyne and Purdue Biomakers!
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. BBa_K1114701 , BBa_K1114702 , BBa_K1114703 , and BBa_K1114704 are all BioBrick compatible Devices that have been documented and experimentally validated for this work. We have also characterized non-BioBrick parts in the form of our Level 1 MoClo devices and those include BBa_K1114500 , BBa_K1114502 , BBa_K1114503 , and BBa_K1114504 .
✓ Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry
✓ Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines) - Here is a list of all of the Parts that we submitted to the Parts Registry
✓ Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project - Read our Human Practices article and check out our standardized Datasheet App
✓ Team registration
✓ Complete Judging form
✓ Team Wiki
✓ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
✓ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
