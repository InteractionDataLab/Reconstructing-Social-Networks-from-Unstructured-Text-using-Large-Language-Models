Troubleshooting Notebook
We are working on creating a troubleshooting manual for others who use MoClo.
Failing Level 1 Reactions
After many of the team’s level 1 reactions failed, we sat down to troubleshoot the situation. We first discussed possible reasons for a reaction failing and decided on the following reasons:
Enzyme was not added, was no longer effective, or was the wrong one
Part is contaminated
Wrong Destination Vector
Wrong antibiotic plate used during transformation
Buffer no longer effective
Forgot to add a part of destination vector
Wrong thermocycler settings
Competent cells no longer effective
Forgot heat shock step during transformation
Cell recovery time was not long enough during transformation
We then talked about would could cause blue colonies resulting from a transformation
Restriction enzyme did not cut correctly
Ligase no longer effective
Wrong fusion site design
Labeling error so incorrect part used
Too much destination vector was added
We also came up with the following reason as to why there could be no growth after a transformation:
XGAL which is toxic did not dry long enough on the plate when performing blue-white screening
The wrong antibiotic plate was used
A toxic gene was used
Competent cells no longer effective
After examining the specific level 1 reaction that failed, we were able to find that they each contained B0015_DF. After tracing back when the last time this part was made, it was found that it had been switched with another part during minipreps. We then restreaked out the part and corrected the error.
Terminator B0015_DF
We had many Level 1 MoClo Reactions with B0015_DF fail.  We sequenced our existing plasmid stock and discovered that it was mixed up with the RBS B0033_BC. We struck out the glycerol stock from the -80C freezer and sequence analyzed that part.  It turned out this part was correct so we replaced the plasmid, -20C, and -80C stocks with the correct B0015_DF.
