Outreach
On July 29th, we invited a member of the Marlborough High School iGEM team to come into our lab. During the visit, we helped to familiarize this eager student with basic laboratory techniques. Together we prepared minipreps, restriction digests, gels, and DNA quantification. During the fall we plan to send one member of our team to visit the high school team to serve as a mentor.
We wish them best of luck!
