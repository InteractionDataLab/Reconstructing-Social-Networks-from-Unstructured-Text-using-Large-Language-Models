Second Annual NEGEM
On Saturday, September 14, 2013, we hosted the Second Annual New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University. During NEGEM, each of the teams presented their research for twenty minutes and followed by a ten minute question and answer session. The mini conference was very constructive in that each team was provided with critical feedback for their presentations.
We appreciate the MIT , Wellesley and Stanford-Brown teams for taking time out of their busy schedules to participate. We hope to see them again next year!
In addition, we would like to thank Kim de Mora, Kitwa Ng, Karen Goebel, and Ana Sifuentes from iGEM Headquarters for coming to share their take on each of the presentations.
We cannot wait to see the improvements of everyone's presentations in Toronto!
