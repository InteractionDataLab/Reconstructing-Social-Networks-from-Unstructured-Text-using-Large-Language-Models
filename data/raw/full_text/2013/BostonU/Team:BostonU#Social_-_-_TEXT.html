Bowling at Jillian's
On June 4th and 5th, the Wellesley Desyne iGEM team visited for two days of collaboration and learning. We spent the time on Monday sharing knowledge of basic biology and practicing with the Clotho app Eugene . On the second day, we learned about one another's projects while providing constructive feedback. To end the two day event, we went to Jillian's for a friendly round of bowling.
