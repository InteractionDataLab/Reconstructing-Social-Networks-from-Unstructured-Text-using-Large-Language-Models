biology, MoClo, and developed plans for our summer projects, specifically <A href="”https://2013.igem.org/Team:BostonU/QS”">quorum sensing</A>.</LI><LI>Learned about Clotho software suite and learned how to use Eugene, RavenCAD, and Pigeon from other members of the <A href="“http://wiki.bu.edu/ece-cidar/index.php/Main_Page”">CIDAR lab</A>.</LI><LI>Familiarized ourselves with protocols and lab etiquette</LI><LI>Stocked up on lab supplies (plates, broth, plasmids)</LI></UL><H10>Week of May 19, 2013</H10><UL><LI>Began to create new bicistronic design RBS’s (BCDs): used PCR on BCD2 template to make BCD1, followed with LV0 reaction</LI><LI>Began to restock low concentration and low volume plasmid for level 0 parts</LI></UL><H10>Week of May 26, 2013</H10><UL><LI>Sent BCD1 made last week for

to make BCD8, BCD12, BCD13, BCD16, followed with LV0 Rxn, and sequence verification. All reactions yielded original BCD2, likely due to preparing buffer the night before. Retried the same LV0 experiment later in the week. </LI><LI>Met with Dr. Jake Beal from <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BostonU/Collaborations">BBN Technologies</A>. He showed us how to use <A href="https://synbiotools.bbn.com/"> BBN’s Synthetic Biology Tools</A> to analyze our future flow cytometry data. </LI><LI>Performed ligation PCR in order to generate the following constitutive promoters: J23110_AB, J23113_AB, J23115_AB, J23115_EB, J23116_AB, J23116_EB, J23117_AB, J23118_AB, J23119_AB</LI><LI>Met with <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BostonU/Collaborations">Wellesley HCI</A> team for a synthetic biology training session and to learn about each other’s projects. We also held Eugene tutorials and practiced making Eugene scripts for some famous experiments.  We also had our first <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BostonU/Social">social event</A>, bowling at Jillian’s!</LI></UL><H10>Week of June 9, 2013</H10><UL><LI>Tried to PCR apFAB46_AB, apFAB57_AB, apFAB61_AB, apFAB70_AB, apFAB71_AB  promoters but unfortunately it failed </LI><LI>Tried PCR for R0079_EB, R0079_FB, C0012_CD, and C0062_CD but the transformations proved unsuccessful </LI><LI>Continued the second try on BCD Lv0 Parts, also failed: only produced BCD2 template. Probably too much DNA template in the PCR reaction. Retried entire protocol starting from PCR. BCD16_BC was successful </LI><LI>Archived frozen stocks and plasmids of BCD1_BC and BCD1lox_BC</LI><LI>Travelled to Wellesley to brainstorm some ideas for improving the visualization of the Eugene language</LI><LI>Attempted Level 1 reactions using J23100_AB, BCD1_BC, BCD2_BC, B0034_BC. B0034m1_BC, B0034m2_BC, E1010m_CD, B0015_DE, DVL1_AE; 80% of reactions failed. Discovered that BCD1_BC, BCD2_BC, B0034_BC, B0034m1_BC, and B0034m2_BC might be contaminated.  Did Zymo transformation with RBS and BCDs that failed due to following an older protocol. Did Bioline transformation of RBS and BCDs</LI></UL><H10>Week of June 16,2013</H10><UL><LI>Continued third try on unsuccessful BCD Lv0 parts. This time we gel extracted the PCR products and used a higher quality ligase in the reaction mixture</LI><LI>Performed backbone switch for RFP transcriptional units from KAN to CAM and AMP  </LI><UL><LI>pJ004R_AE, pJ024R_AE, pJ034R_AE, pJ044R_AE,  pJ054R_AE, pJ064R_AE, pJ074R_AE, pJ084R_AE, pJ094R_AE in both DVL0_GB and DVL2_AF </LI></UL><LI>Attempted 6 Lvl 1 reactions: pJ004C40_AE, pJ004C79_AE, pJ00B1C40_AE, pJ00B1C79_AE, pJ00B2C40_AE, and pJ00B2C79_AE. Unfortunately the transformations did not result in colonies. It was later found that the terminator used B0015_DF was contaminated </LI><LI>Began PCR for B0015_DH, an essential terminator for our inverter constructs that has proven difficult to generate in the past</LI><LI>Did level 1 reactions to try and construct transcriptional units to impart resistance to spectinomycin, ampicillin, and kanamycin. These are referred to as pJ002maadA_EF, pJ002mbla_EF, and pJ002mkanR_EF, respectively</LI><UL><LI>All level 1 reactions produced no insert when run on the gel. This was determined to be because the B0015_DF was actually B0033m_BC. A new PCR and streak out of B0015_DF from the -80 were started</LI></UL><LI>Sequence confirmed J23110_AB, J23116_EB, J23117_AB, and J23118_AB and archived them. J23113_AB and J23115_AB were not sequence confirmed and will be restarted in the future </LI><LI>Transformed the BioBrick plasmids pSB1AT3 and pSB3T5 and miniprepped them. Both were then used as template in a PCR reaction to produce the tetA_CD level 0 part. The first level 0 reaction failed, but the second produced the appropriate band on a gel and was eventually sequence confirmed</LI><LI>Bioline transformation of RBS and BCDs from previous week was a success.  Picked new colonies for overnight cultures and sent in samples for sequencing </LI></UL><H10>Week of June 23, 2013</H10><UL><LI>Sent BCD8, 12, and 13 for sequence verification. All were successful </LI><LI>Started workflow for Lv0s needed for pRepressible Library: C0012_CD, C0062_CD, C0071_CD, R0010_FB, R0079_FB by streaking out BioBrick cultures for the respective parts</LI><LI>Tested all Lvl 0, 1, and 2 destination vectors for possible biobrick backbone contamination. DVL0_DH was missing a SpeI site and DVL0_FB was missing 4 base pairs from its Lac Z insert</LI><LI>Did sequence analysis of BCD1_BC, BCD2_BC, B0034_BC, B0034m1_BC, B0034m2_BC. Sequences were correct; archived and stored new frozen stocks and plasmids</LI></UL><H10>Week of June 30,2013</H10><UL><LI>Added fusion sites to C0071, C0062, C0012, R0010, R0079 using PCR, followed with clean up, Lv0 Reaction, and sequence verification. R0010_FB, R0079_FB, and C0071_CD were successful. C0012_CD and C0062_CD were not. We think the DVL0_CD backbone is contaminated with empty biobrick backbone, causing an inefficient reaction and transformation. Tried to pick more colonies from plate to see if we could find some that contained the desired plasmid.</LI><LI>Struck out B0015_DF from the -20C and -80C frozen stocks to sequence since we think these samples are incorrect</LI><LI>B0015_DH was sequence confirmed but with only one SpeI site. It will function as a MoClo part but should not be used as a template in the future</LI></UL><H2>July</H2><H10>Week of July 7, 2013</H10><UL><LI>From the additional colonies, we picked for C0012_CD, C0062_CD; C0012_CD was successful. Redid the C0062_CD Lv0 Rxn </LI><LI>Started Lv1 reactions for our arabinose-tetR inverter that will serve as an example of how the library can be used </LI><LI>The PCR reactions and level 0 reactions for J23113_AB, J23115_AB, J23115_EB, J23116_AB, J23119_AB, and DVL0_DH were done and all were sent for sequencing. </LI><LI>Level 1 MoClo reactions were done for the pConstitutive library with different promoter and RBS combinations but all involving E1010m_CD, B0015_DE, and DVL1_AE.
