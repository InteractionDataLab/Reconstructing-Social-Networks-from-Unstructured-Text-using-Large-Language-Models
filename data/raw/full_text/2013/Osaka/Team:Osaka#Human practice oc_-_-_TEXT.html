Team:Osaka/Human practice oc
From 2013.igem.org
We have been taught that DNA carries genetic information in school.  But, some may have had wandered if DNA really exist. And we thought it is partly because few students have experienced to extract DNA. Then, we presented a booth where students can do experiments to extract DNA from juice and plants.  At the same time , we introduced “what iGEM is” and our projects(2012 and 2013) by a poster. To introduce our project in 2013 , we showed a picture showing the relationship between A-type and B-type Ecoli (see “Project” page). Also we showed some mathematical models to describe how bacteria diffuse and increase on a plate.   Ⅱexperiments  ⅰextracting DNA from juice All you need is a cup of juice and ethanol. It’s pretty easy.   Preparations  ・transparent glass ・20ml of 100%ethanol(cooled) ・5ml of 100%juice Processes 1. add ethanol to a glass 2. add juice to a glass 3. You can see DNA. They look like white threads.  ⅱextract DNA from wild grass To extract DNA from wild grass, it takes much longer and more processes than that of juice. So students have much more time to think many things to understand biology more.For example, what the procedure they are doing means or if the result of the experiment differs between one kind and another.   Preparations ・25ml of water ・1.0g of salt ・2ml of surfactant ・2ml of 100%ethanol ・mortar ・tea strainer ・two glasses 1. add wild grass to powdered dry ice and mash it in mortar  melt it at room temperature after freeze it 2. mix water, salt and surfactant  3. add 1 to 2 and mix softly with chopsticks 4. filter mixed material with tea strainer 5. pour filtered liquid in Eppendorf tube(1.5ml) centrifuge it at 3 minutes(precipitate imprities) 6. pour supernatant liquid(6) in another Eppendorf tube(1.5ml) pour enough ethanol in it  7. You can see DNA that looks like white threads after a while  Ⅲgeneralization  Through these experiments, we are sure that students have more interest in biology. Actually , over 100 students came to our booth in 7hours. Almost all of iGEM OSAKA members were working for this experiment booth during the time. And all of the students said they were impressed to extract and see DNA with their hands and the experiments were really good. Some even said they want to join iGEM OSAKA someday. Our Human Practice Project in Open Campus was very successful !!
