Modelling
As you can see in the diagram given below, MazE protein expression is stimulated by glucose, MazF protein expression is always presented under weak constitutive promoter; however, it can be stimulated by AI-2.
We assign glucose and cell density as parameters and want to find the value of those where MazE/MazF is greater than 1. Our cell can only be alive in such region.
Since MAzF is toxic protein for cell and MazE is the antitoxin of MazF, the stoichiometric interaction of those proteins determine survivability of the cell.
