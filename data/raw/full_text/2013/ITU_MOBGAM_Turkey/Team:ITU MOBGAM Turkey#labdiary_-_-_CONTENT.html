Plasmids that contained PTS p0, MazE and 12 N (RFP) were restricted with EcoRI and SpeI enzymes. Also, 1I (RBS) and 4F (terminator) were restricted with XbaI and PseI I enzymes. Then, MazE was ligated with terminator (4F) and ampicillin backbone; also, PTS p0 was ligated with RBS (1I) and kanamycin backbone.
