METU iGEM TEAM:
From beginning to end of our iGEM journey, METU iGEM team help us in meaning of sharing experience from old days, a laboratory training for our unexperienced members (we couldn’t do that due to our facility rules), and wiki problems. Besides all, we visited each other in our town and became good friends. Also, we arranged National Turkey iGEM meetings together.
Baskent_Meds iGEM TEAM:
Another friend from Ankara. We have met in National Turkey iGEM meeting in İstanbul hosted by us. They sent us a biobrick that codes for T7 promoter. We are grateful for this. :)
