Small Phage July - August Notebook: July 16 - July 31 Daily Log
Small Phage
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
7/16/13
- Started approximately 60mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
7/17/13
- The titer from 7.15 was too low to start an actual round of mutagenesis. One more round of propagation was performed for 7.13 Phage Propagation Experiment
- Do we want to talk about this round of mutagenesis? phage stock 80e6. 1.5mL of E coli, 90uL of phage.
7/19/13
- Performed spot test for 7.17 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fifth Protocol
- Performed titer to determine phage concentration 2 for 7.13 Phage Propagation Experiment
7/22/13
- A lot of ousekeeping:
Went over parental guide, and pre-/post- questions for The Adventure of Baxtor Bacteria
Discussed next steps
Cleanned out fridge and took pictures of plates
Updated website
7/26/13
- Designed protocols for 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol and decided to conduct an experiment to verify bacteria growth curve (specifics see 7.27 Bacteria Growth Curve After Dilution )
- Started 3mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
7/27/13
- Conducted 7.27 Bacteria Growth Curve After Dilution
7/28/13
- Started 15mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
- Started phage liquid culture to test for superinfection.
7/29/13
- Performed part 1 of 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol .
- Did a spot test to determine the concentration phage in yesterday's liquid culture (We couldn't test for superinfection because all the bacteria were lysed.)
7/31/13
- Started 8mL BL21 liquid culture overnight and performed dilution series for the spot test procedure in 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol .
