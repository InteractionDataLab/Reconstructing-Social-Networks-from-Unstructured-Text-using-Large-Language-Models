iGEM 2013
2013 BYU iGEM Team
The BYU iGEM team consists of twelve devoted undergraduate students and two BYU faculty advisors.  Coming from different backgrounds, we represent six majors and two colleges within BYU; we even speak eight unique languages! By building a team with varied, yet complementary, backgrounds and interests, we are able to approach our project from multiple angles and, at times, impress even ourselves.
