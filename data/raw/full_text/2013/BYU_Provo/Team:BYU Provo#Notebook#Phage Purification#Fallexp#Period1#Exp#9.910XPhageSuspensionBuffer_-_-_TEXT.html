9.9 10X Phage Suspension Buffer Creation
I) Purpose
Create a 10X solution of Phage Suspension Buffer that will be used to run our Phage Purification Centrifugation.
II) Expected Outcome
We should have a working phage suspension buffer that will facilitate movement of phage in the CsCl gradient.
III) Reagants Used
Tris-HCl
MgCl2
NaCl
Ultrapure H20
NaOH
IV) Actual Procedure
Add 58.44 g of NaCl to a 1 Liter Flask to achieve a 1 M solution.
Add 20.33 g of MgCl2 to the same 1 Liter Flask to achieve a .1 M solution.
Add 100 mL of 1 M concentration of tris-HCl 6.8 ph to the same flask.
Fill the flask with ultrapure H2O until it reaches the 1 L mark.
With a pH reader read the pH of the solution.
Add 5 microliters of NaOH at a time until the solution reads 7.2-7.5 pH on the pH meter.
