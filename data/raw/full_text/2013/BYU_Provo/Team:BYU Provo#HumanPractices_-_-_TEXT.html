iGEM 2013
2013 BYU iGem Team
This is a super rough draft and it NEEDS EDITING
BYU iGem team consists of thirteen devoted undergraduates, one graduate TAs, two BYU faculty advisors, and one supporting artists. Our diverse team of undergraduates represents 6 majors and 2 colleges within Brigham Young University. We even speak 8 languages! By building a team with varied, yet complementary, background and interests, we are able to approach our project from multiple thought processes and, at times, impress even ourselves.
