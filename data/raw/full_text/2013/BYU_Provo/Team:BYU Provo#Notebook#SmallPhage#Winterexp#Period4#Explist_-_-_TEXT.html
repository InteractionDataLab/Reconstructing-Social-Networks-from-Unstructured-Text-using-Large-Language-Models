4.25 T7 phage viability test
This is our first experiment after finals. We needed to test whether our bacteria and phage have survived the week. This experiment also confirmed that we can propagate phage in liquid culture.
Detailed procedure: 4.25 T7 phage viability test
4.26 T7 Phage Selection Test
We proposed to select for smaller phage using concentrated top agar. This is a preliminary experiment to see whether or not our hypothesis will work.
