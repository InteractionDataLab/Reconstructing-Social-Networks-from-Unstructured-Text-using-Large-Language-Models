8/2/13
- Prepared Phage Suspension Buffer
8/5/13
- Prepared Cesium Chloride samples for layering on Wednesday
8/7/13
- Performed a cesium chloride gradient purification on T7 mutated phage from the large phage team.
8.7 CsCl Gradient
8/9/13
- We performed dialysis on T7 mutated phage from the cesium chloride gradient on 8.7.  Because the gradient only showed one band, we decided to not do an EM as we most likely had mutant phage mixed in with wild type.  We discussed a gradient to run in the future that will be able to further identify where the phage band.  We decide on a CsCl gradient of concentrations 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.6.  We hope to be able to identify exactly where the phage bands so that we can make small variations in the gradient at that point.  This will allow us to separate mutant phage from wild type.
8/12/13
- Performed a CsCl gradient on the T7 mutant phage from the small phage team.  We used the same phage that we used on 8.7.
8.12 CsCl Gradient
8/14/13
- We performed dialysis on the phage from 8.12 CsCl Gradient
-We also ran another T4 gradient 8.14 T4 CsCl Gradient
8/16/13
- Prepared Cesium Chloride samples for centrifugation of T4
8.16 T7 CsCl Gradient
