Safety Form
Approval
Safety forms were approved on 9/20/13 by David Lloyd and Julie McNamara.
Overview
Brigham Young University has set protocols aimed at ensuring student safety in the laboratory. Students are required to wear long pants and close-toed, waterproof shoes and follow safety precautions for working with chemicals and biological agents (protective clothing including gloves, etc.). They are prohibited from eating in laboratory rooms. The labs are kept locked when not in use and are subjected to random inspections to ensure that safety procedures are followed.
All biological agents we are working with are BSL1 (E. coli and various phages) or BSL2 (Vibrio cholera, ATCC 14035). Dr. Julianne Grose, our instructor, has received BYU approval to work with BSL-2 reagents. All students involved have been trained to handle cholera safely. We have followed current safety measures for disposing of biological samples in biohazard waste as well as cleaning glassware and desktops with bleach and/or ethanol.
All BioBrick parts created and used are non-hazardous and have been contained to the lab.
The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at Brigham Young University supervises the use of recombinant DNA and handles other biological safety and hazard issues in experiments. Such use might involve constructing and handling DNA molecules in organisms. The IBC must review and approve all proposed experiments in advance of actual work. The link to there website is found here . We have submitted the necessary forms to our IBC and have received approval for our work.
