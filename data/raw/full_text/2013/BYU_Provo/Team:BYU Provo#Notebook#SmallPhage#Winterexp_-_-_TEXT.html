This marks the start of our small phage group! Although we are still on the background-research phase and not doing any wet-lab experiments, we are certain our work will be worthwhile. As Dr. Grose, our wonderful instructor, says "a month in the lab will say you a day in the library." After two weeks of hardcore literature search, we now have a clear idea of where our project is headed. And we are super excited to get started!

Our T7 phage arrived during these two weeks and we were finally able to start some actual lab work. Our first task was to determine the titer of the phage stock we received. We then tested for the optimal E coli strain that support T7 growth. The latter part of our weeks was devoted to further research to finalize our project.

These two weeks are the interim period between Winter semester and Spring term at BYU. We did not perform any experiments during finals week, but we returned right after to get back to work. To get off on a good start for Spring Term, our first priority was to make sure our E coli strain and phage have survive finals week. We also performed our first liquid culture and selection test! We are happy about the results.
