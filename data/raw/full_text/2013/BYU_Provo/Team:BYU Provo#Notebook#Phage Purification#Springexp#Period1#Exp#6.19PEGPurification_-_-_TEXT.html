6.19 PEG Purification
I) Purpose
The first step in the phage purification process.  Purify phage from bacterial debris so that we can determine the banding pattern of T7 in CsCl.
II) Expected Outcome
Phage will be purified from the bacterial debris to be further purified in a CsCl gradient.
III) Reagants Used
phage suspension buffer
10 mM Tris-HCl
100 mM NaCl
10 mM MgCl2
DNase I
RNase A
chloroform
NaCl powder
PEG 8000
T7 bacterial lysate
IV) Actual Procedure
Add 166.5 µL DNase and 22.5 µL RNase to T7 bacterial lysate.
Add .0904 mL chloroform to complete lysis and let the preparations sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Dissolve 1.32 g of solid NaCl and let cool at 4◦ C for 1 hour.
Centrifuge the suspensions at 6500 rpms (7000 g) for 10 minutes at 4◦ C.  Remove supernatant and put in clean flasks.
Dissolve 3.96 g PEG 8000 and let sit at 4◦ C overnight.
Centrifuge the suspensions at 8000 rpms (10000 g) for 15 minutes at 4◦ C. Discard the supernatant.
Turn the centrifuge bottles over to let sit for 5 minutes to drain off any remaining supernatant.
Suspend the pellets in .675 mL phage suspension buffer and let sit overnight at 4◦ C.
V) Results
We were able to purify phage to a point that it can now be used in the CsCl gradient.  We finished with phage dissolved in phage suspension buffer.  We will be using this solution in a later class to further purify in a CsCl gradient.
