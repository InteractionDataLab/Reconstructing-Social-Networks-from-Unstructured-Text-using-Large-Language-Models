While the phage purification team was working out a kink in their cesium chloride gradient, we focused on modeling the relationship between capsid size and plaque size. Then once the cesium chloride gradient was perfected, we performed another round of mutagenesis, hoping that we would now be able to see mutant T7 bacteriophage.

All our hard work finally paid off! We managed to isolate a smaller and a larger T7 bacteriophage!

We had a great time at the iGEM regionals in Toronto! We're excited to be going to the World Championship Jamboree and got right back to work. Our first focus was getting good pictures of our mutant phage so that we could confirm their phenotypes.

For the last weeks of iGEM, we continued to characterize the mutant phage more. We sequenced the capsid protein and searched for mutations. In addition, we cloned in the capsid proteins for T7 wild type, S4 (Small mutant 1), S10 (Small mutant 2), and L8 (Large Mutant 1).
