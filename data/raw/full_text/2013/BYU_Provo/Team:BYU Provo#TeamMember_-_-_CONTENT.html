After that she didn't know what to do with her life. So of course she is going to apply for grad school.

This childishness is to blame for the entire children’s book text.

What can you say? She is a total lab junkie. Between iGEM and a Cancer Research Fellowship, Jade spent more time in the lab than outside it this summer. Being cooped up all day in a small room that most students are not aware of its existence, Jade is disappointed that she missed her chance of absorbing as much Vitamin D as possible during the best part of the year. But at least she got to make something &quot;explode&quot; safely in a biology lab (see picture on the right).

Outside of the lab and school, you'll find him training for a half-marathon, tending his honey bees, gardening, and trying to impress his amazing wife. In a rare moment of free time, he is most likely watching a good movie, playing (or writing) music, or visiting family, or watching BYU sports.

Before coming to BYU and joining the iGEM team, his only experience with bio-engineering came from learning about Mewtwo in Pokemon: The Movie. Needless to say, he has come a long way. Nathan is a sophomore microbiology student, but more accurately a rough, tough, farmbody from deep in the heart of Texas. Despite growing up on a farm, he never learned how to milk a cow.

For several years his research laboratory has been focused on studies involving molecular and cellular approaches to animal physiology and cartilage biology. He is the author of numerous manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals including the prestigious journals Science and Nature Medicine. He regularly includes undergraduate students in his research. Over the past two years, his publications have included 37 different undergraduates as co-authors.  He has been invited to make numerous presentations at national and international meetings, three times as a plenary speaker and chaired the 3rd International Conference on Transgenic Animals.
