Protocols
5/1/13
We met today and went over some safety information on working with our BSL2 cholera. We then broke up into our smaller teams to make goals and deadlines for our lab work for the semester. The following is the outline of our goals and deadlines:
Goals for Spring Semester:
Get enzymes
Dipersin B - contact previous iGem team   (5/1/13)
If no response by 5/6/13, we will order gene sequence
Subtilisin savinase - order gene sequence (5/3/13) - get genes back by 5/13/13
Clone enzymes into E. coli -
Dispersin B -  cloned in by 5/20/13
Subtilisin savinase -  cloned in by 5/20/13
Run assays on enzymes
AmyA - Run assays and be done with AmyA by 5/13/13
Dispersin B - Run assays and be done by 5/29/13
Subtilisin savinase - Run assays and be done by 5/29/13
Gather data/optimize system
Start 5/31/13
Start mathematical modeling with data by 6/17/13
We also emailed several iGem teams that have used Dispersin B in the past to see if we could get their parts for the dspB gene. If we don't hear back from them by Monday, then we will work with Dr. Grose to  have our dspB gene synthesized for us.
We have also had difficulties finding a source to obtain our Subtilisin savinase gene, so we may need to order the Subtilisin savinase gene as well. We emailed Dr. Grose the sequence that we need, as well as possible costs from several companies.

5/3/13
We started new cultures of cholera to grow over the weekend. Cultures were prepared in 4mL of our high SSW LB. We also streaked our cholera onto a new plate. Both the plate and the overnight cultures were placed in the 30°C incubator to grow over the weekend.
We heard back from the Lyons, France iGem team about getting part BBa_K802001 from them, however they are on vacation until Monday. They will send us the part as soon as they get back. We emailed them our FedEx shipping number and address. We also checked on the primers that last year's iGem team prepared for the DspB, but they were using a different plasmid vector so we will have to redesign new primers for the part that we are getting so that we can use it in the pet-15B plasmid in order to allow us to easily purify the proteins once we get the gene cloned into E. coli and are producing the enzyme. We will work on designing the new primers this weekend so that we can order them on Monday.
We are also going to research assay methods for our specific enzymes to be able to test the ability of our enzymes to degrade biofilms. On Monday we will go over the different methods we researched and plan which assays we are going to use for our specific enzymes.
We gave the sequence of the Subtilisin savinase gene to Dr. Grose for her to order today. Their turn around time is seven days, then a few extra to mail it to us. We will adjust our goal dates according to when we receive the sequence back.
5/6/13
We talked to Dr. Robison today and were able to get a sample of Bacillus subtilis from his lab. The savinase produced by this bacteria strain is a homolog to the savinase that we were originally looking for. We plated the sample that we got from him and put it in the incubator at 30C to grow the culture. Once the bacteria is grown we can amplify the gene that we want and clone it into the pET15b plasmid to allow us to purify the gene after it is produced, as the pET15b plasmid attaches a His-tag to the protein that causes it to be excreted from the cell and easily isolated and purified.
Primers:
We also designed our primers for AmyA, DspB, and savinase and submitted these to Dr. Grose to be ordered:
DspB forward (BI242):
GGGCATATGAATTGTTGCGTAAAAGGCAATTCCATATAT
DspB reverse (BI243):

AmyA forward (BI259):

AmyA reverse (BI260):

Subtilisin savinase forward (BI255):
GGGCATATGAATAAGAAAATGGGGAAAATTGTTG
Subtilisin savinase reverse (BI256):
CCCGGATCCTTAACGTGTTGCCGCTTCTGCGTTAACAA
We also heard back from the France iGem team (Lyons team) and they will send us their DspB part when they get back in the lab next week. We also looked up the academic calendar for the other iGem team that could send us the part, University of British Colombia (UBC), but they are on vacation until Monday 5/13/13. We will see if they get back to us then.

5/8/13
We are waiting for our primers to get in, but we set up five polyacrylamide gels in preparation for protein assays that we will do in the near future. We also discussed the different papers that we have each researched to find a suitable assay for biofilm degradation analysis. Most of the papers that we found referred back to a 2003 paper for the general protocol followed:
Pitts, B.; Hamilton, M.; Zelver, N.; Stewart, P. A Microtiter-Plate Screening Method for Biofilm Disinfection and Removal. J. Micro Methods 2003, 54, 269-276.
We decided to base our assay off of the protocol presented in this paper, then adjust for our specific needs with cholera. We’ll all go over this paper again in preparation for Friday so we can order the reagents that we will need for this.
5/9/13
Today the primers designed for dspB, AmyA, and Savinase were received in the mail. Cholera overnights #1 were seeded and left in the 30 degree incubator. Overnights were made by adding: 4 mL SSW LB + 0.5 mL previous cholera overnight.
5/10/13
We started a new V. cholerae culture and seeded it from the cultures started on 5/3/2013. The biofilm growth continues to be really good when using our SLB media. We also got our primers back so we will start our pcr and cloning for AmyA and Savinase on Monday.
We also compiled the following list of necessary reagents for our enzyme assay. We sent the list to Dr.  Grose to see what is available here and what needs to be ordered. We will alter the protocol on Monday to fit our specific needs.
Enzyme Assay:
Equipment:
96-well microtiter plate
96-pin replicator to seed the plates
Nunc-Immuno wash 8 channel device (they used to rinse the plates, I don't know if we need this or can use something else)
BioTek FL600 plate reader to measure absorbance
Reagents:
Crystal violet stain
CTC stain (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride)
95% ethanol
For baselines they used urea and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with Na2S203 as a neutralizing agent
Reference for biofilm assay protocol: Pitts, B.; Hamilton, M.; Zelver, N.; Stewart, P. A Microtiter-Plate Screening Method for Biofilm Disinfection and Removal. J. Micro Methods 2003, 54, 269-276.
5/13/13
We rechecked our biofilm growth. Allowing the biofilm to grow for 72 hrs in the SLB media gives the highest yield of biofilm in our overnights.
We will use the Pet15 plasmid for our enzymes: Restriction sites are Nde1/BamH1.
We input the following primers into the database:
DspB BI242: Forward primer
DspB BI243: Reverse primer
Savinase BI255: Forward primer
Savinase BI256: Reverse primer
AmyA BI259: Forward primer
AmyA BI260: Reverse primer
AmyA plasmid for cloning: pIG 86 Followed protocol for phusion PCR of AMyA and Savinase -Sample 2x with each
The following is our modified biofilm assay protocol:
Biofilm Assay Protocol
Biofilm Prep
Overnight culture of V. cholerae grown in SSW LB at 30 °C for 72 hrs.
20 ml of culture added to 180 ml of SSW LB for dilution
Fill each well of a 96-well plate with 200 ul of SSW LB
To inoculate wells, immerse replicator pins in the diluted bacterial suspension for 30 seconds, then lower replicator pins into wells and agitate for 15 seconds.
Plates are covered and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 24 hrs.
Every 10-12 hrs during the incubation period, spent nutrients are pipetted from wells and replaced with fresh SSW LB
Enzyme Treatment
At 24 hrs, planktonic suspensions and nutrient solutions are aspirated and wells are rinsed by carefully removing and adding liquid from the side of the well using a micropipette. Wells are washed four times.
Enzymes are added to wells immediately after rinsing and allowed to sit for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, wells are washed again and the stains are applied:
0.16% filter-sterilized CTC incubated at room temperature for 2 hr, CTC solutions are prepared directly prior to staining
0.3% CV solution incubated at room temperature for 5 min
After incubation times, absorbed stain is eluted from attached cells with 95% ethanol
Wells are rinsed four times to remove excess stain
Wells then filled with 200 ul ethanol and incubated
CTC incubated for 15 min at room temp
CV incubated for 5 min at room temp
Absorbance Readings
Plates are vigorously shaken for 10 seconds, then light absorbances are read with BioTek FL600 plate reader
CTC absorbance is read at 450 nm
CV absorbance is read at 540 nm
Each raw absorbance value is then corrected by subtracting the mean of absorbance readings for the blank wells prior to statistical analysis
