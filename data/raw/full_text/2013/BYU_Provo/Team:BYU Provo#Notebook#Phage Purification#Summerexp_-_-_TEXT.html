July 1 - July 15
We are working on getting Electron Microscope images of our purified phage.

Experiment Listing
July 16 - July 31
In these two weeks, we ran a CsCl gradient for the T4 group. We also discussed the children's book and other team projects.

August 1 - August 16
These two weeks were spent focussing on isolating T7 phage.  After successful results coming from T4, we had high hopes of getting the same results with T7.  Our first attempts were unsuccessful but we believe we will be able to isolate the mutant T7 in the following weeks.

August 17 - August 31
We ran into more problems attempting to purify the T7 phage.  While we were at first able to get a clear band of phage using the cesium chloride gradient we were no longer able to achieve the same results.  We focussed on creating a gradient that would allow the T7 phage to band once again but we did not have any luck in doing so.
