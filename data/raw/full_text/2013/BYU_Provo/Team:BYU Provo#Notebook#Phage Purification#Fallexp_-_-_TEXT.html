September 1 - September 14
We have recently had many problems getting the T7 bacteriophage to band.  We focussed on trying to discover what the problem was and how we could fix it.  We think it could have been due to a bad batch of phage suspension buffer, and our results confirmed it!

September 15 - September 30
After several attempts, T7  has  finally banded! We discovered that the band may disappear because the T7 band is faint, even at very high titer. Mutated phage is low titer, and if the gradient is made more specific, the band would be impossible to see. With this knowledge, we can continue on with purification. These two weeks are the last weeks of experiments, and the latter week was devoted to working on the wiki.
