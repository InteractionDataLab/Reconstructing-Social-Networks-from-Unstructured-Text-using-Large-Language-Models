II) Expected Outcome
Small and large mutated phage.
III) Reagants Used
T7 mutant phage
TEM kit
IV) Actual Procedure
Place 10 microL of sample onto EM grid. Let sit for 1 min.
Dry by touching a dry piece of material to the side of the grid. (provided in EM kit).
Place 10 microL EM dye onto grid. Wait 90 seconds before drying.
Place in EM grid carrier. Deliver to the TEM operator for imaging.
