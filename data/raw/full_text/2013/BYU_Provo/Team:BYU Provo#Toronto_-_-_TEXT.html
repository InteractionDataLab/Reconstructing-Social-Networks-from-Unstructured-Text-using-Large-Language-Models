Accomplishments
BYU 2013 iGEM Team is excited to announce that we won a gold medal during the North America Regional Jamboree and have advanced to the World Championships! We are especially proud because we are a team of undergraduate students, most of whom had limited research experience before iGEM, but we successfully competed in the over-graduate division.
We really appreciate the marvelous work of iGEM headquarters and the University of Toronto for hosting us. We are also grateful for all the comments we received during our presentation and poster session. Your comments are invaluable to us and we will work hard to perfect Phage Pharming for the World Championships!
