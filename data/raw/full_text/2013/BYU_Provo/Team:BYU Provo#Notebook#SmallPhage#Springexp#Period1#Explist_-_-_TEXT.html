September-October
5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
In this experiment, we aimed to test whether or not we can select for smaller phages using concentrated top agar.
Detailed procedure: 5.3 T7 Phage Selection Method Test
5.3 T7 Phage Amplification/Purification
In this experiment, we aimed to establish a basic protocol for amplifying and purifying phage.
Detailed procedure: 5.3 T7 Phage Amplification/Purification
5.5 Amplification From a Plaque Test
In this experiment, we aimed to test whether or not we can amplify a phage plaque using liquid culture
Detailed procedure: 5.5 Amplification From a Plaque Test
5.6 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test
In this experiment, we aimed to test whether or not starting phage liquid culture with different concentrations of phage will affect the overall yield of phage progeny.
Detailed procedure: 5.6 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test
5.9 T7 Selection Method Test #2
We performed this experiment to familiarize ourselves with x8 agar.
Detailed procedure: 5.9 T7 Selection Method Test #2
5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2
We repeated 5.6 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test to test for whether 1uL will give us even higher phage titer
Detailed procedure: 5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2
