6.10 RNase A Preparation
I) Purpose
Prepare RNase to be used in phage purification procedures.
II) Expected Outcome
Viable stock of RNase.
III) Reagants Used
Sigma-Aldrich Ribonuclease A from bovine pancreas (powder form)
10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2
1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4
IV) Actual Procedure
Add 10 mL of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer to the RNase powder.
Heat to 100◦ C for 15 minutes.
Allow solution to cool to room temperature.
Adjust to pH 7.4 using 1 M Tris-HCl.
Aliquot and store in -20◦ C.
V) Results
We created an RNase A solution that can be used in the phage purification procedure.
