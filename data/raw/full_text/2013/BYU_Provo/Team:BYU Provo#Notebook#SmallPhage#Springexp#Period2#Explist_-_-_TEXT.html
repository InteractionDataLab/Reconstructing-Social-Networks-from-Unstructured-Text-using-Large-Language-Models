5.13 Determining E coli Concentration With Spectrophotometer
This experiment was performed to give us a general idea of how many E coli cells are in 1 mL of liquid culture overnight. This information is necessary for our mutagenesis procedure.
Detailed procedure: 5.13 Determining E coli Concentration With Spectrophotometer
5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock
This experiment aimed to determine the concentration of phage particle in stock 5.3. This information is also necessary for our mutagenesis procedure.
Detailed procedure: 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock
5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
Our first round of mutagenesis.
Detailed procedure: 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
By cloning the minor capsid gene of our T7 phage, we'll establish the wildtype phage gene sequence.
Detailed procedure: 5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
