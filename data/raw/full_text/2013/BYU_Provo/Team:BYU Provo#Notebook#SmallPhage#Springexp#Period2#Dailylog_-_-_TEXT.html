5/13/13
- Purified phage stock in 5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2
- Performed 5.13 Determining E coli Concentration with Spectrophotometer
- Started the registry for phage stock
5/14/13
- Started two 5mL BL21 overnight at 6:00pm
5/15/13
- Completed 5.9 T7+ Liquid Culture Phage Concentration Test #2 by doing the spot test
- Performed 5.15 Titer Test on 5.3 T7 new Phage Stock to determine phage concentration and estimate dilution for applying mutagen
- Sorted LB plates made on May 8 and threw away the ones with obvious contamination
5/16/13
- Took plates from 5.15 out of incubation at around 4:00pm
5/17/13
- Determined that all LB plates from 5.8 had contamination
- Poured new LB plates
- Made x8 top agar
5/18/13
- Stacked up the LB plates made yesterday. No obvious sign of contamination seen.
- Threw away the 5.8 LB plates (the ones with contamination).
5/19/13
- Started two 5mL of E coli BL21 overnight
- Designed procedure for applying mutagen and selecting for T7

5/22/13
- Performed spot test for 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
- Ran agarose gel to confirm PCR product
5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
5/23/13
- Started two 25mL E coli BL21 liquid culture over night at around 6:00pm
5/24/13
- Proceeded with 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment by performing preliminary selection using x8 top agar
5/25/13
