Prepared phage for an EM. 7.3 EM Phage Preparation

Prepared streaks of E. coli B. and BL21 using streaks from last Friday. 7.5 Bacterial Preparation
7/8/13
Worked on the wiki.  Prepared for our outreach to the community activity.
7/10/13
Took pictures of our purified phage using an EM.  We noticed large amounts of crystalline structure in the solution that we believe to be CsCl.  We believe that increasing the dialysis time will help purify the CsCl better and remove these crystalline structures.
