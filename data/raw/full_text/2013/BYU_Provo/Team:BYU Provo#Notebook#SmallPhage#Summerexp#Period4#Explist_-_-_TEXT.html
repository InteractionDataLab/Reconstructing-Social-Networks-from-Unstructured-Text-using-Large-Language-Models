8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One
Add description
Detailed procedure: 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One .
8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol
This is our eighth round of mutagenesis. In some respect, this is the most successful of our mutagenesis yet, because we were able to to get a high titer of phage in each aliquot collected after CsCl purification (with an estimated average of 10E7 pfu/mL). However, because phages are spread out throughout the gradient and did not band, we cannot identify which ones are wild type and which ones are mutant.
