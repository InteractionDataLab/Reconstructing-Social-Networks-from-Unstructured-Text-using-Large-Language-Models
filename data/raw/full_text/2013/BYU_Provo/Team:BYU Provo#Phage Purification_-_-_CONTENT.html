We have found that T7 can self assemble with scaffolding proteins without forming procapsids, and that T4 has only been know to form procapsids. We may not have to worry about T4 if the other group isn't using it. 
</P><P>Important findings - 
Phage have been purified before
Phage capsids can self assemble
Phage (amber strain) can have their genes knocked out to make a hollow phage
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="3.2F18.2F13">3/18/13</SPAN></H3><P>Priorities List:
Find out how to put drugs into the capsid

Next class we plan on growing up phage so that we will have a decent amount of phage to work with.  We have several procedures that we plan on testing so that we can see if we can purify the protein capsid.  We hope to be proceeding with these as soon as we have phage that we can use.  Another issue that we need to consider is how to get drugs into the capsid.  We need to be able to test and see if we can actually fill our empty capsids with a material.  We have several procedures found in other papers that could possibly help us with this.

</P><P>I spent time trying to find a good procedure to propagate phage in a liquid medium. I finally found one that I think will work well for us. 
</P><P>Today we learned a procedure for how to count phage.  We performed a phage titer on the T4 phage to see if we have a high enough concentration to work with.  This is the general procedure:
Phage titer: reported in Pfu/mL (Pfu stands for plaque forming unit)
	mix E. coli (500 microL) with 50 microL of phage lysate
	incubate for 20 minutes
	mix with 4 mL top agar and then plate
	holes will appear in the agar that are called plaques
</P><P>How we followed it:
We filled five test tubes full of 90 microliters of Liquid Broth each.
We added 10 microliters of our desired phage to the first test tube and then mixed
We took 10 microliters of the first tubes mixed solution and added it to tube 2, and followed the same procedure for each test tube down the line to tube five.
We then labeled 6 culture tubes 0 to -5. In the first culture tube, we added 20 microL phage to .5 mL bacteria. In tubes -1 to -5 we took 20 microL from eppendorfs and added to .5 mL bacteria.  We then allowed a 20 minute waiting period for the virus to infect the E. coli. Then, 5 mL top agar was added to each culture tube. Each tube was then plated and incubated at 37 degrees C.

We ran into several problems while doing the titer.  After we had completed the titer, we found out that the pipet tips we had used were contaminated.  When preparing the top agar, we had to melt it in the microwave which caused it to boil over.  This could have caused some contamination.  While filling my -5 plate with top agar, there was only enough to put in 4mL of agar instead of the 5mL that was called for in our procedure.  
</P><P>RESULTS: 3/22  None of the plates had any phage.  There was just a lawn of bacteria growing.  This could either be because of the problems mentioned above or because the source of T3 was bad.  Seeing as nobody else was able to grow any phage we believe that the source was old.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="3.2F22.2F13">3/22/13</SPAN></H3><P>AC 3/22
</P><P>We had several sources of error in our procedure. First off there was contamination that affected our results. The micropipette tips that we used had not been autoclaved. This caused contamination to several plates. We also microwaved the augar instead of using a heat bath. This caused there to be tons of condensation in the plates and the augar to crack. We didnât have any plates that had phage present. 
</P><P>Results: Despite the sources of error, it was pretty clear that the phage did not react with the bacteria. This was either because the phage was not viable, or because of the contamination.
</P><P>AB 3/22/2013
</P><P>None of the plates showed phage. A big problem that we had was contamination, but our agar was also crystal looking and cracked in several places. sources of contamination were accidental use of unautoclaved pipettte tips, and the agar was microwaved and exploded, causing water condensed in the microwave to fall into the agar. 
Results: No phage, lots of contamination. We may need a new source of phage, or just better lab technique. 
</P><P>Next step: find procedures for purifying different phage. Become experts on phage structure. possibly help with designing point mutations.

</P><P>Phage structure:
T7 has proteins 10 A and 10 B for capsid, and an assembly protein
T4 has SOC and HOC proteins
</P><P>DL 3/22
</P><P>We are currently waiting for our phage to come in so that we can begin running tests to purify the capsid.  We have several procedures in mind.  We need to prepare the reagents so that when the virus comes in we can immediately begin attempting to purify it.  Most of the procedures we have found apply specifically to T7 but we will also try them on T4.  We will continue to look for other procedures that may apply specifically to T4.

Bacteriophage T7 has six tail fibers that attatch to E.coli. These fibers are homotrimers (composed of three identical units of polypeptide) of gene 17. These kinked fibers attach to the LPS on E.coli.
</P><P>Replication: The bacteriophage T7 replisome is an ideal model system for studying replication dynamics because it recapitulates the key features of more complicated systems, yet can be reconstituted in vitro with only four proteins. DNA synthesis is carried out by a stable, one-to-one complex of gene 5 protein (gp5) and thioredoxin, a processivity factor produced by the E. coli host. Gene 4 protein (gp4) contains both helicase and primase domains whereas gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5) is the single-stranded DNA binding protein (15).

</P><P>Large-scale Amplification and Purification of T7 Phage Nanoparticles
</P><P>The T7-p66, T7-p66x2 and T7-wt nanoparticles were propagated in the log phase culture of E. coli BL21 (OD600~0.8) grown in M9-LB broth (LB broth supplemented with 50 ml 20X M9 salts, 20 ml 20% glucose and 1 ml of 1 M MgSO4 per liter) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at 37Â°C until complete lysis of the culture (3â6 hours). Thirty minutes before removing the culture from the shaker, DNAse I and RNAse A (Roche, Germany) were added to degrade released bacterial nucleic acids. T7 phage nanoparticles were precipitated from the culture supernatant by addition of 1 M NaCl and 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, Merck) followed by overnight incubation at 4Â°C. The T7 phage pellet was resuspended in Tris-NaCl buffer (PH 8) and PEG and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. To remove residual PEG and debris, an equal volume of chloroform was added, gently inverted and the top aqueous phase was harvested after low-speed centrifugation at 4Â°C. The purified T7 nanoparticles were sterilized using a pyrogen-free 0.2 Âµm pore-size cellulose acetate filter (Millipore) and stored at 4Â°C until further analysis.
</P><P>Removal of Bacterial Endotoxin from T7 Phage Nanoparticles
</P><P>The bacterial endotoxin (LPS) concentration in all T7 nanoparticle preparations was determined in triplicate using a sensitive colorimetric Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) QCL-1000Â® kit (Lonza, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LPS was removed from T7 phage nanoparticles based on a method for removal of endotoxin from protein solutions by phase separation using Triton X-114 as described by Aida et al. [22] and modified by Hashemi et al. (manuscript submitted for publication).
</P><P>Genes of T7: <A href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism%3a10760+keyword%3a1185&amp;offset=25" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism%3a10760+keyword%3a1185&amp;offset=25</A>
Thus phage T7 has an icosahedral shape with an edge of 37.7Â±0.5nm, a volume  of (120Â±10)x103nm3, and a small tail that is 6-7% of  the head volume. (STRUCTURE OF BACTERIOPHAGE T7 Small-AngleX-rayandNeutronScatteringStudy)

</P><P>We performed a phage titer spot test on two bacteria.  We used the BL21 and W3110 strains of E. coli.  We first put 100 microL of broth into epindorf tubes.  We then took 10 microL of 1L, 10L, 40T4, T4DOS, and T4 infected phage and placed it in seperate tubes labeled 0.  We performed a dilution series adding 10 microL of phage to the tube -1 and continued down to -5.  Next we added 4.5 mL of 1x top agar to .5mL of both strains of bacteria and plated it on LB plates.  We had previously divided the plates into six sections with the labels 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, and -5.  We took the phage from each concentration and spotted it on the plates.  We allowed the plates to sit and let the phage soak in.  We then placed the plates in the 37 C overnight.
</P><P>Results: 04/10 40T4 did not grow on W3110.  All the other plates formed plaques.  All of the plates experienced some sort of running.  Controls showed no contamination and grew a lawn of bacteria.

</P><P>We performed a phage titer test to determine which bacteria would be most viable for our phage propagation. We used BL21 and W3110 strains of E. Coli. We placed 100 ÂµL of broth into 5 epindorf tubes. We used as phage 10 ÂµL of 1L, 10L, 40T4, T4DOS, and T4 infected phage and placed them each in one of tubes labeled -1. We performed a dilution series taking out 10 ÂµL each time and placing it into the next tube, 5 times. the total volume in the last tube was 110 ÂµL.
We added 4.5 mL of 1X top agar to .5 mL of broth and plated it on LB plates. We spotted each concentration on the plates and incubated it overnight at 37Â°C.
</P><P>Results from 04/08:
</P><P>Phage 10L w/ w3110 had large scale infection every concentration
</P><P>Phage 10L w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
</P><P>Phage 1L w/ w3110 had infection in very large concentrations
</P><P>Phage 1L w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
</P><P>Phage T4 DOS w/ w3110 had infection in very large concentrations
</P><P>Phage T4 DOS w/ BL21 had infection in very large concentrations
</P><P>Phage 40 T4 w/ w311o had no phage infection

</P><P>We performed titers of T4 infected phage from off of two separate E. Coli strands, BL21 and W3110. We added .1mL of the liquid culture to 1 mL of both strands of bacteria. After allowing infection to occur overnight, we centrifuged the tubes to separate the bacteria from the phage. We separated the supernatant into a new eppendorf tube, and used 10 ÂµL as the 0 concentration. We then performed a phage titer using five tubes of 90 ÂµL LB each, adding 10 ÂµL from each one to the next. Using a micropipette we spotted 2ÂµL of each dilution onto both 4.5 ml 1x plates and .5 mL W3110 plates. To avoid smearing, we allowed the plates to sit for over an hour and then we incubated them at 37 C overnight.
</P><P>Results: The concentrations we used are still way too strong. We will have to dilute the concentration even further if we want to see anything more than cleared plaques.
</P><P>DL 04/10
</P><P>We performed another titer of T4 infected phage.  T4 phage had been plated on BL21 and W3110 and pulled off.  We took .1 mL of this and added it to 1 mL bacteria of both cultures.  After allowing to grow overnight, we centrifuged to pellet the bacteria and took off the supernatant of the phage.  We then did a dilution series using the supernatant as 0 concentration.  We diluted it up to -5 by adding 10 microL to 90 microL of LB.  We then spotted 2 microL from each tube on 4.5 mL x1 LBTA and .5 mL W3110.  Allowed them to sit for an hour and a half and placed the plates in the 37C overnight.
</P><P>AB 4/10/2013
</P><P>Today we did a titer of the T4 infected phage that was pulled off a plate of T4 phage on BL21 and W3110.  We took .1mL of this liquid culture and added it to 1 mL bacteria of both cultures. We allowed the phage to infect overnight, then centrifuged to form a pellet. We decanted the supernatant into a new eppendorf tube and used 10 microL as our 0 conc. in the titer assay. We performed the titer using 5 tubes of 90microL LB, transferring 10microL from each tube to the next. We spotted 2microL from each tube on 4.5 mL 1x TA and .5 mL W3110. We allowed them to sit for an hour and a half before placing the plates in the 37C incubator overnight. 
Results: WE had plaques on both plates, but we have yet to achieve what appears to be a dilution - we get only a cleared plaque on every concentration. The control was clear of contamination.

Notes on Cholera presentation: Current testing method to identify cholera is long and expensive. 
Begin by explaning that you can sense both presence and non presence of cholrea via RFP and GFP - GFP equal cholera present/high cell density, and RFP = low cd. Does this give false negatives?

We watched the presentations of the large and small phage groups, and presented our project and ideas. 
</P><P>DL 04/15
</P><P>We presented our progress so far as the phage group.  Two of the main questions that arose was how we are going to know if we have ghost capsids and how we are going to know if they are viable.  We need to research this so that we know how to test for this.
</P><P>AC 04/15
</P><P>We presented our project today. There were a few things that we needed to do better. For one, we need to present better background and show how it ties into our research, specifically the need for a capsid library. I feel like we could have been a bit more engaging and better rehearsed as well. 
</P><P>We will need to find a way to test the capsids for viability, and somehow characterize them.

</P><P>Look at Utah State's wiki for last years project to get a good idea of a cool website.  Talk to Dr. Grose about how pure our sample needs to be.  We prepared a document with a step-by-step plan of what our goals were for the rest of the semester.  We also read through the purification procedure that we will be doing Monday to ensure that we understand everything and have all the materials.
</P><P>AB 5/1/2013
Today we are going to create a plan to follow throughout the semester. We also talked with Jordan about reagents for performing phage purification on Monday. We also reviewed the methods for our procedure.
</P><P>-Plan to make an excel sheet that will calculate the needed volumes of reagents for the volume of lysate used. 
</P><P>-Plan how many days it will take to complete the procedure - plan in breaks and time
Questions to ask Dr. Grose - what is less expensive/better - Freeze thaw or use lithium chloride
</P><DL><DD>Answer: Try both
</DD></DL><P>-Best method for determining phage purification
</P><P>-Step 3 on 3.3.1.1
</P><P>-CsCl gradient - we may need someone with experience to help
</P><P>-should we plan on using CsCl? Or just plan on PEG? (time to set up gradient)
</P><P>-Step 7 on 3.2.1 (dialysis??)

</P><P>We are still missing our DNAse to run the purification experiment.  If it doesn't come by Friday we will probably go around asking professors if they have any.  Today we prepared a W3110 culture and a culture of phage.  For the W3110, we put 24 mL of broth in a flask and added 2 mL of W3110 from a liquid culture.  We then put it in the 37 C incubator.  For the phage culture, we put 24 mL of broth in a flask and added 1 mL BL21.  Then we put it in the 37 C incubator for 1 hour.

</P><P>Thankfully we donât have to use the ultracentrifuge to achieve 10,000 g. We also wonât need to order any special centrifuge tubes, so we should be able to start experimentation on Wednesday.
</P><P>We added 1 mL of w3110 and 1 mL of BL21 to 24 mL of LB each and placed them both into the 37C incubator. After an hour of incubation we infected the BL21 Ecoli with t7 phage and left to incubate until wednesday. We will infect the w3110 tomorrow with T4
</P><P>AB 5/13/2013
</P><P>Today we hunted down Dr. McCleary, and learned that we did not need to use the ultracentrifuge unti llater. we began new 25 mL solutions (24mL LB broth, 1 mL bacteria) and placed both w3110 and BL21 in the 37 C incubator.
For BL21, we waited an hour and then infected with 100 microL phage. We then placed it back into the 37 C incubator for 48 hours. T4 will be infected tomorrow, due to its shorter incubation time. 
</P><P>DL 05/13
</P><P>We found Dr. McCleary and he explained to us that we donât need to use the special centrifuge until the later steps.  We will be able to run the experiment at 10,000 g with a different one that we already have the tubes for.  We should be running the purification on Wednesday.
To prepare for it, we began growing BL21 and W3110.  After an hour we infected BL21 with 100 microL T7 phage.  Tomorrow, we will infect T4.  We placed both back in the 37 C incubator.
