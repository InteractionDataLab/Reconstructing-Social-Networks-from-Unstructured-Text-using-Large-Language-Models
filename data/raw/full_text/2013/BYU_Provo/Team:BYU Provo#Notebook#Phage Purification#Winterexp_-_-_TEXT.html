March 15 - March 31
Beginning our journey in phage purification, we were excited to start running experiments immediately.  However,  our instructor Dr. Grose so wisely informed us that it is essential to begin any research by seeing what others have done first.  The first few weeks of lab we focused on researching in the library.  We reviewed the work done by others before us in order to understand where we should begin.  The research provide a variety of avenues that we could follow and even a few procedures of purification that were explained step by step.

During theses weeks we worked hard to find the best possible E. coli to use for each phage's propagation. This was accomplished through multiple rounds of phage titering. We also created freezer stocks of our E. coli for future use
