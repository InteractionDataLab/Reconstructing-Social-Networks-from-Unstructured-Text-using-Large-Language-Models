5.8 Infecting With Phage
I) Purpose
Infect liquid bacterial cultures with phage for phage amplification.
II) Expected Outcome
Phage available to purify.
III) Materials Used
Cultures of bacteria to infect
Phage from Lysate (Experiment 5.6)
IV) Actual Procedure
add 100 microL of phage from lysate to bacterial culture. Allow proper infection time before using in purification protocol.
For BL 21: infect with T7 phage for 24 - 48 hours
For W3110: infect with T4 phage for 7-8 hours
Place in 37◦ C for infection
V) Results
The phage infected the cultures, as proven by visible clearing when compared to the noninfected control cultures of bacteria.
