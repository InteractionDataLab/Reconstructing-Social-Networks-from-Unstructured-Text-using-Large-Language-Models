Small Phage September - October Notebook: September 1 - September 15 Daily Log
Small Phage
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
9/1/13
Performed additional spot tests for 12 samples to verify results of phage concentration in each aliquot for 8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol .
Started approximately 10mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
9/2/13
Worked on compiling data for 8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol ; there are significant differences between CsCl gradient for control sample and that for mutated phage sample.
9/3/13
Started approximately 20 mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
9/4/13
JL, LP
Discussed results from recent spot test for 8.26 Mutagen Concentration Test - Eighth Protocol . Phage too spread out to effectively select for mutant phage. Decided to stop until the Phage Purification Team can get the wildtype T7 phage to band.
Discussed plans and designs for team wiki with Darren and Keltzie.
Started T7 propagation to generate enough phage for the Phage Purification Team to experiment with. Specifically, to a 15mL centrifuge tube we added 8mL of LB, 2mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight, and 20uL of 8.24 T7 phage stock.
9/5/13
LP
Started approximately 10mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
9/6/13
JL, LP
Purified phage propagation sample from 9.4 via centrifugation (5 minutes at 3000 rpm) and cholorform. Spot tests were then performed to estimate phage titer.
Took pictures of plates from 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One using alpha imager.
Divided up assignments for updating notebook.
9/7/13
JL
Started approximately 15 mL E coli B liquid culture overnight.
Worked on data analysis / picture processing for 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One .
9/8/13
JL
Continued data analysis / picture processing for 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One .
Performed preliminary titer in preparation for repeating the modeling experiment with T1 and T2. For specifics, please see 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One .
Started approximately 25mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight
9/9/13
JL, LP
Discussed analysis of modeling result using ImageJ.
Repeated the modeling procedure in 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One for T1 and T2. Incubation started at 4:30pm.
Started a fresh round for phage propagation for the Phage Purification Team. Specifically, to a 15mL centrifuge tube we added 8mL of LB, 2mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight, and 20uL of 8.24 T7 phage stock.
Divided up assignments for updating the wiki.
9/10/13
JL, LP
Took the T1 and T2 modeling plates our the incubation at 4:30pm.
Started approximately 25mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
Measured plaque sizes using ImageJ.
9/11/13
JL, LP
Isolated the phage (from 9.9) by centrifuging down the bacteria, transferring the supernatant to a new 15mL centrifuge tube, and adding 900ul of chloroform to the supernatant.
Took pictures of T1 and T2 plates for 8.16 Modeling phage plaque size - Experiment One .
9/12/13
JL
Spot test showed plaques up to -7. This indicate that the phage suspension solution we gave the Phage Purification Team for CsCl was at least 10E9 pfu/mL.
Started approximately 30mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
9/13/13
JL, LP
The Phage Purification Team has good news for us. They were able to observe banding in their latest CsCl gradient for T7. We thus decided to perform a new round of mutagenesis this weekend and hopefully selection next week.
In preparation for mutagenesis tomorrow, we performed titers for 8.24 T7 stock.
Started approximately 5mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
Streaked out E coli B.
9/14/13
JL
Autoclaved ddH2O, LB, x2 top agar.
Used the autoclaved ddH2O to make adenine and uracil solution. Specifically,
- 254mg of uracil was dissolved in 10mL of ddH2O to produce a uracil solution with a concentration of approximately 2.5mg/mL
- 753mg of adenine hemisulfate dihydrate was dissolved in 10mL of ddH2O to produce a adenine solution with a concentration of approximately 5mg/mL
Started approximately 5mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
9/15/13
JL, LP
Performed the mutagenesis procedure in 9.13 Mutagen Concentration Test - Ninth Protocol
Started approximately 20mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight
Started phage propagation
