Cholera Detection March - April Notebook
Cholera Detection
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
March 15 - March 31
These initial two weeks were focussed on researching methods to break-down cholera biofilm. We obtained our first cholera plate and began to grow biofilm. We also began the transformation of last year's iGEM team's construct for detecting cholera.
Daily log
April 1 - April 15
After successfully growing the cholera detecting construct from last year, we discovered that it did not function as we had hoped. So, we started to sequence the plasmid in order to understand what we truly had. Cholera biofilm was successfully grown in sea water like conditions.
