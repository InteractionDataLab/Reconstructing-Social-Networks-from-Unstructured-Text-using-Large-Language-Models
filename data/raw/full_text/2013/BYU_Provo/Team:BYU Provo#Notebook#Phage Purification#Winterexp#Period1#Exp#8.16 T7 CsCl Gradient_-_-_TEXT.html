8.16 CsCl Gradient
I) Purpose
Further purify the phage to a high level of purification.
II) Expected Outcome
Purified and viable phage will be extracted from the CsCl gradient.
III) Reagants Used
T7 mutant phage
CsCl
phage suspension buffer
IV) Actual Procedure
Create different concentrations of CsCl solutions to create a gradient.
Add 0.5497 g of CsCl to 2 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6175 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2960 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6207 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2966 g/ml density gradient.
Add 0.8128 g of CsCl to 2 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2975 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6288 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2981 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6332 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2989 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6375 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.2997 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6408 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3003 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6451 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3011 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6494 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3019 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6527 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3025 g/ml density gradient.
Add 0.8288 g of CsCl to 2 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3034 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6608 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.3040 g/ml density gradient.
Add 1.6407 g of CsCl to 4 mL of phage suspension buffer to create a 1.6 g/ml density gradient.
Layer the gradient into two centrifuge tubes, using half of the total volume created for each tube.  For example, add 2 mL of 1.3 density to one tube and the other 2 mL to another tube.
Add 4 mL of mutant phage to the top of the gradient in both tubes
Fill the remaining space in the tube with phage suspension buffer to the top.
Centrifuge at 26500 rpms (100,000 g) for 2.5 hours.
Extract using a needle and puncturing the side of the tube, placing the needle at the bottom of the tube.
Extract about 2 mL of phage at a time. Add about 1.5 to one eppendorf.
When the needle is removed place another eppendorf under the hole to catch any leaking phage and fill it with the remainder of the phage in the needle.
V) Results
The phage didn't band anywhere. After running a spot test it appears that the phage where present in every aliquot extracted.
