Small Phage July - August Notebook: August 1 - August 16 Daily Log
Small Phage
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
8/1/13
- Performed the spot test in 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol .
8/2/13
- Because the top agar used in yesterday's spot was contaminated, we decided to redo this step. Also, because most of the spot tests went down to -6, we performed further dilution for the next testing to get a more accurate idea of phage concentration.
- Discussed modeling options: model phage plaque size against various variables including phage particle size, agar concentration, and bacterial concentration.
- Streaked E coli W3110 and K12 from frozen stock in preparation for the viability test in 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8/3/13
- E coli W3110 streak worked, but K12 did not survive. Thus, we tried to amplify K12 using liquid culture. For specifics, please consult 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8/4/13
- Started E coli liquid culture over night
10mL of BL21 for spot test in 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol .
2mL each of BL21, W3110, and B for phage viability and infection test in 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8/5/13
- Performed Phage viability/infection test for 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
- Discussed ideas for modeling phage plaque sizes
8/6/13
- Check up on the phage viability/infection test for 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
- Started 5mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
8/7/13
- Performed spot test to estimate phage titerfor 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
- Phage Purification Group started the purification process with CsCl gradient.
8/8/13
- Started approximately 15mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
8/9/13
- Performed Preliminary Titer for 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8/11/13
- Started approximately 20mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
8/12/13
- Performed titer - repeat for 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments based on the results from 8.10 preliminary titer test.
- Started T1 propagation.
- Made accurate x2 top agar as preparation for 8.16 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Experiment One .
8/13/13
- Started approximately 20mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
8/14/13
- Performed mutagenesis and spot test for 8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol .
- Performed spot test for T1 propagation. Spotted 5uL of -2 through -7 dilutions.
8/15/13
- T1 propagation revealed plaques on each of the tested dilutions, suggesting that this propagated T1 phage stock has a titer of at least 109 pfu/mL -> more accurate spot test / titer needed to determine the exact phage concentration.
- Started approximately 30mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
8/16/13
- Started 8.16 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Experiment One .
- Phage Purification team performed the CsCl gradient for 8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol .
- Started approximately 10 mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
