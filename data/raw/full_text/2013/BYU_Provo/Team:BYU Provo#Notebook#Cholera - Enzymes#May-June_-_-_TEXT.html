Protocols
May 1 - May 14
We started contacting teams that have worked with Savinase and DspB. We started the initial work of purifying AmyA which was available at BYU. As well we started outlining the biofilm degradation assay using positive and negative controls.
Daily log
May 15 - May 31
Continued our work of cloning AmyA and Savinase into E. coli. Ran initial biofilm degradation assays using urea as a positive control.
Daily log
June 1 - June 14
We are still having issues with AmyA and Savinase. We are starting to fine tune our biofilm degradation assay.
Daily log
June 15 - June 30
After a few more failed attempts with Savinase we are restarting the isolation from B. subtilis. AmyA is almost finished and ready for purification. The biofilm degradation assay is still being fine tuned.
