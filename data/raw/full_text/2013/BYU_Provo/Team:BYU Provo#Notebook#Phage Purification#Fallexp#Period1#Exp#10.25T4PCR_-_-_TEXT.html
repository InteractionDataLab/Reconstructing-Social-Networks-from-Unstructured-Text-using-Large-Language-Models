10.25 T4 PCR
I) Purpose
Identify DNA sequence difference in capsid proteins between mutants.
II) Expected Outcome
PCR products of the T4 wild type and mutant capsid protein genes.
III) Reagants Used
2 microL T4 wild type or mutant phages in each.
TAQ PCR
2.5 microL Thermo Pol. buffer (for high fidelity TAQ)
1 microL primers  (B1 297/B1 298) (B1 302/B1 303)
17 microL ddH20
1 microL 10 mM dNTP's
.5 microL Polymerase (TAQ)
TAQ was run to amplify and sequence the capsid proteins using two sets of different primers. (4 samples)
IV) Actual Procedure
Put 2 microL phage in an eppendorf tube. Incubate at 99 C for 5 min.
Add the above reagents in the order listed to each tube.
Run PCR using the TAQ protocol
Run in 1% gel
100 mL 1x TAE buffer
1 g regular agarose
heat until dissolved completely
cool and add 2 drops ethidium bromide
pour with 14 well mold and allow to solidify
add 2 microliters of dye to 4 new tubes
extract 5 microliters of each phage and put them into each of the tubes.
We put the DNA ladder in well 1, well 2 was WT 297/298, well 3 was MUT 297/298, well 4 was WT 301/302, well 5 MUT 301/302
