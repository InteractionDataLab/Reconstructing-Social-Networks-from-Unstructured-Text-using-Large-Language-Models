Protocols
8/21/13
Although we got a decent band for our DspB PCR product, the amount of product and the concentration was low enough that we decided to run another cycle of PCR on the product to get more product and increase the concentration of our product.
Our PCR tubes were labeled:
DspB
DspB Control
8/23/13
We prepared and ran our PCR product on gel, however there was a problem with the gel and the ladder bled out, so we will re-run our product on gel again.
We also replated Bacillis subtilis on an LB plate and placed it in the 37 degree incubator.
8/28/13
Ran the Purelink Genomic DNA minikit with B. subtilis to prepare it for PCR and ran the product on a gel. Both samples gave a strong band so we definitely have a DNA template for running the PCR.
