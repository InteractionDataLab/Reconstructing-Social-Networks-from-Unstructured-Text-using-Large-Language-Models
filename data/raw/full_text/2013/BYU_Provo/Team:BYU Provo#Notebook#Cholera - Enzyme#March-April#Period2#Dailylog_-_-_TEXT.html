We met as a team and presented our project plans in detail today. In our discussions with the rest of the team we decided that we want to try to characterize cholera’s biofilm, as this hasn’t really been done before. We will research articles on characterizing other biofilms and see if we can adapt their procedure for our cholera biofilms. The article, Molecular Achitecture and Assembly Principles of V. cholera Biofilms, was suggested to us as a starting point.
We also found a research group that has worked with Subtilisin Savinase so we can contact them and see if they can send us a sample of Bacillus lentus:

Cholera an acute, secretory diarrhea by O1 or O139 serotypes
Epidemics have been increasing in intensity, duration and frequency-----great need for more effective approaches for prevention and control
Organisms grow best in presence of salt
In water, cholera enters a viable but non-culturable form Serotypes based on the O antigen of LPS
We need to focus on how to characterize biofilms, and should alter the NaCl concentrations of growth media for cholera to induce stringent response growth.

Lab Work
Based on our research, cholera biofilms grow best under stringent response. One of the factors affecting this response is salinity. As our cholera cultures are growing fine but aren't really producing a biofilm we decided to raise the salinity of our LB to better simulate the aqueous environment in which cholera biofilms are normally found. We made LB using a synthetic sea water recipe in place of water. The recipe was obtained online from thelabrat.com. Our synthetic seawater (SSW) LB recipe consisted of the following:
Regular LB Mix + 24g NaCl
11.9g MgCl2-6H2O
2.0g CaCl2-2H2O
0.83 g KCl
1 Liter of media was made and the pH was then adjusted to 7.8 and autoclaved.
Discussion
We emailed Dr. Grose the contact information for two research groups that have worked with Bacillus lentus. The first group is based out of South Africa and is working on using Subtilisin Savinase to break down a variety of biofilms. However, Dr. Grose remembered that they attempted to contact this team last year and were unable to get any kind of response. Also, shipping the bacteria samples that we need from South Africa would be tricky so we found a research group at John Hopkin's University that was doing research with Bacillus lentus. They weren't doing anything related to biofilms, but were using the bacteria that we need. I emailed the contact info to Dr. Grose and she sent them an email. We are now just waiting to hear back from them.

Started 4ml overnights with our SSW LB media
30 degrees celsius with cholera plate culture
30 degrees with 350ul seeded from previous overnights
37 degrees with chlolera plate culture
37 degrees with 350ul seeded from previous overnights
Hopefully, the higher salt content in the growth media will induce strong biofilm growth.
We also identified two labs that have worked with Dispersin B in the past couple of years and sent an email to Dr. Grose to forward to these labs. One was to Dr. Chen at NYUMC, the other was to Dr. Demuth at Louisville.
4/8/13
Our cholera overnights grown in our SLB media shows significant visible difference in the amount of biofilm growth.
We are currently waiting to hear back from several research groups we have contacted to try to obtain samples of the bacteria strains that we need. While we wait, we focused today on doing further research to find other possible sources to obtain the bacteria samples, and on our semester final presentation.

Acinetobacter baumannii: aerobic gram-negative bcateria; highly resistant to antibiotics
Metabolite profiling of biofilms performed using NMR spectroscopy
Principal metabolite components included: acetates, pyruvate, succinate, UDP-glucose, AMP, glutamate, lysine

Changes in metabolism are dependent on the growth state
Changes in acetyl-glucosamine level may act as markers for biofilm infections
The higher levels of succinate, pyruvate and acetate indicate a reduction in energy production
Higher levels of UDPG, AMP and NAD+
UDPG a possible precursor of polysaccharides----production of exopolysaccharide (EPS)----helps to maintain the biofilm
High levels of AMP to maintain biofilm structure
Oxidative stress can promote biofilm formation (high levels of NAD+ as a cofactor for oxidative stress defense protein)
