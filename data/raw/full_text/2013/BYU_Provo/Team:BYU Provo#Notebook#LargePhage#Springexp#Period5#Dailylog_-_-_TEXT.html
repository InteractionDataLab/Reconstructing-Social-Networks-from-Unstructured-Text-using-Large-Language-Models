Today we did a titer on the "M2" phage (The second round of mutagenesis)
6/26/13
Results for the M2 titer. Plaques go down to 10^-5 (about 6 plaques) So our concentration is somewhere between 10^-5 and 10^-6.
Today we were going to start mutagenesis again, but it looks like out E.coli needs to be streaked out again, we're planning to start the whole procedure again tomorrow with an overnight culture of e.coli B plus adenine. Once the bacteria is grown we will centrifuge it and resuspend it to a concentration of 10.5x10^8 cells/mL in M9+ medium with the addition of 20 ug of both uracil and adenine as well as the mutagen 5' deoxybromouridine. We will then resuspend the mixture in separate tubes and add 2x 10^9 of our T4 Do stock. Then we'll aerate at 37C until clearing with 1 mL of chloroform.
6/27/13
Today we did another round of mutagenesis using the same protocol. We also did spot tests on a few of the pin prick plaques found from the experiment on 6/24.
6/28/13
Here are the results from yesterday's experiments. We are slightly concerned because in general the plaques are smaller so it's tough to see true mutants.
