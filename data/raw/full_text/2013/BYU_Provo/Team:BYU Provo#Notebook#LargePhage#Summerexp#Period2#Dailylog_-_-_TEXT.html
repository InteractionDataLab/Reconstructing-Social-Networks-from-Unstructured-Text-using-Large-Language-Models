Today Jade and LJ helped us spot test all of the fractions above the band from our last CsCl gradient. These fractions were numbered 12-19, but 15 was skipped. Each fraction was spot tested at a titer of 10^0, 10^-2, and 10^-4 and incubated agar side down at 37C overnight.
9/18/13
We looked at the results from the spot test today. We found that: All fractions had phage at 10^0 Fractions 18, 19, 17, 16, and 14 had large clearings still at 10^-2 while 13 and 12 just had individual plaques. Fractions 18, 19, 17, 16, and 14 had individual plaques at 10^-4.
We also measured the capsids and tails of the TEM images.
9/23/13
We spent our time in class and over the weekend measuring the phage capsids and tails to see if there is a correlation between their sizes before and after our mutagenesis.

-Today we worked on the project poster image for the phage diagram
