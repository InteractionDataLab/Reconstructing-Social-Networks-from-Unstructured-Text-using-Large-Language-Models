Protein Purification
Reagents
10X Lysis Buffer: 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 M imidazole, 0.5 M Hepes pH 7.8
1X Lysis Buffer-300:  Dilute 10X stock to 1X and add 1:300 PICs and 300 mM NaCl.  Next add
Phosphatase Inhibitors)- 50 mM NaF (0.21g in 100 mL) and 50 mM glycerolphosphate (1.08g in 100 mL).  Add 1 mM BME (beta-mercaptoethanol) as reducing agent. Recheck Ph.
Add PICs only to enough buffer to re-suspend pellets in.
1X Lysis Buffer-100:  Dilute 10X stock to 1X and add 100 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole.  Add 1 mM BME (beta-mercaptoethanol) as reducing agent.  Recheck Ph.
1. Grow up 500 mL of yeast expressing His-tagged PSK (Grow in PSK activating conditions Gal, Raff, etc.).
2. Re-suspend pellet in 15 mL 1X lysis buffer-300. (Make sure this has the 1:300 PICs added).
3. Lyse cells.
4. Centrifuge for 30 min. to pellet cell debris.  Pour into new tubes and centrifuge for another 30 min.  While cells are spinning prepare Ni-NTA agarose beads (Prepare 250 uL per sample):a. To equilibrate Ni-NTA gently pellet beads at 1,000xg for 1-2 min, mark with pen on eppendorf where liquid line is, pull off ethanol, add 1 mL water and mix, gently pellet beads again, discard water, repeat, re-suspend in1X lysis buffer-300 and mix, gently pellet again, repeat then re-suspend finally in the lysis buffer up to the marked line and let sit on ice for 15 minutes before use.
5. Transfer supernatant to blue cap tube and add 250 uL of Ni-NTA equilibrated in the 1X lysis buffer described above, rotate at 4°C for 3 hr.
6. Centrifuge in 15 mL conical tubes at 1,000 RPM for 3 min. (Wash with 15 mL 1X lysis buffer-300 and repeat).
7. Transfer resin to column and wash with 50 mL lysis buffer-300.
8. Elute with 0.5 ml 1X lysis buffer-100
9. Repeat elution (3x) to verify all protein is off the column.  Elute into new tubes and keep elutions separate.
10. Flash freeze protein in sterile glycerol (15% final concentration).
Biofilm Assay Protocol
Revised from original Biofilm Degradation Assay from Pitts, B.; Hamilton, M.; Zelver, N.; Stewart, P. A Microtiter-Plate Screening Method for Biofilm Disinfection and Removal. J. Micro Methods 2003, 54, 269-276. V. cholerae biofilms are more apt to free float rather than develop on solid surfaces.
Biofilm Prep
Overnight culture of V. cholerae grown in SSW LB at 30 °C for 72 hrs.
20 ml of culture added to 180 ml of SSW LB for dilution
Fill each well of a 96-well plate with 200 ul of SSW LB
To inoculate wells, immerse replicator pins in the diluted bacterial suspension for 30 seconds, then lower replicator pins into wells and agitate for 15 seconds.
Plates are covered and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 24 hrs.
Every 10-12 hrs during the incubation period, spent nutrients are pipetted from wells and replaced with fresh SSW LB
Enzyme Treatment
At 24 hrs, planktonic suspensions and nutrient solutions are aspirated and wells are rinsed by carefully removing and adding liquid from the side of the well using a micropipette. Wells are washed four times.
Enzymes are added to wells immediately after rinsing and allowed to sit for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, wells are washed again and the stains are applied:
0.16% filter-sterilized CTC incubated at room temperature for 2 hr, CTC solutions are prepared directly prior to staining
0.3% CV solution incubated at room temperature for 5 min
After incubation times, absorbed stain is eluted from attached cells with 95% ethanol
Wells are rinsed four times to remove excess stain
Wells then filled with 200 ul ethanol and incubated
CTC incubated for 15 min at room temp
CV incubated for 5 min at room temp
Absorbance Readings
Plates are vigorously shaken for 10 seconds, then light absorbances are read with BioTek FL600 plate reader
CTC absorbance is read at 450 nm
CV absorbance is read at 540 nm
Each raw absorbance value is then corrected by subtracting the mean of absorbance readings for the blank wells prior to statistical analysis
Final V. cholerae Biofilm Degradation Assay
Revised from original Biofilm Degradation Assay from Pitts, B.; Hamilton, M.; Zelver, N.; Stewart, P. A Microtiter-Plate Screening Method for Biofilm Disinfection and Removal. J. Micro Methods 2003, 54, 269-276. V. cholerae biofilms are more apt to free float rather than develop on solid surfaces.
1. In a culture tube, add 50 ul overnight seed to 1 ml SSW LB in culture tube. (Set up three cultures for each time interval and concentration of enzyme to be assayed.) We chose to test 2.5 ul, 12.5 ul, and 25 ul at time = 0, time = 0 & 42, time = 42, and time = 48.
2. At the appropriate time, add the purified enzyme protein. Incubate at 30°C in between treatments.
3. After 48 hours and 30 minutes, transfer each overnight to an eppendorf and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2 minutes, then discard the supernatant.
4. Resuspend pellets in 200 ul ddH2O and centrifuge at 16,000xg for 2 minutes and discard the supernatant. 5. Resuspend pellets in 200 ul ddH2O and stain with 0.03% Crystal Violet solution. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 16,000xg and discard the supernatant.
7. Wash with 0.8 ml 95% EtOH, centrifuge for 30 seconds at 16,000xg, and discard the supernatant.
8. Repeat EtOH wash two more times
9. Resuspend the pellet in 200 ul EtOH and transfer to a 96 well microplate reader.
10. Set the reader to shake for 10 seconds and then read at 540 nm.
