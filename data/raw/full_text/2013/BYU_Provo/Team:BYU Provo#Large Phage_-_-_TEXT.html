The goal of the Large Phage Project is to make a mutant phage that has a capsid much larger than the normal ~200nm T4 capsid. Our intent is to create a protocol where large phage with stable phenotypes will form making it possible to "pick a size" when using phage as a delivery system. The impact of these large phage could mean the difference in making a drug treatment effective and efficient.
Through the use of our mutagen 5'bromodeoxyuridine, a good mutagenesis protocol and the use of a sensitive cesium chloride gradient. We were able to mutagenize and isolate giant mutant t4 phage.
