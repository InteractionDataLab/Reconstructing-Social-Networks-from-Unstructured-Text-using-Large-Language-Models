The following 5 goals must be achieved:
1. Team registration.
Our official team profile
2. Complete Judging form.
Our completed the judging form
3. Team Wiki
Our wiki home page
4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. OR submit a new application of and an outstanding documentation of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry.
Parts that we submitted to the registry.

Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals must be achieved:
1. Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Amylase A degrades biofilm.
2. Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
BBa_K1195001: Amylase A
3. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
BBa_K1195001: Amylase A
4. Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.

Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
1. Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, enter this information in the Registry, create a new registry page for the improved part, and submit this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We resubmitted Dispersin B to the registry.
- Existing BioBrick: Dispersin B
- Our submission: Dispersin B
2. Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Our collaborations with other iGEM Teams.
3. Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider these aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts. Please justify its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
