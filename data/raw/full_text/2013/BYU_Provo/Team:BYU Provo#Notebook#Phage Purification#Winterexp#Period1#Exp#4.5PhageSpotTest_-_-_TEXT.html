4.5 Phage Spot Test
I) Purpose
Test for viable phage.
II) Expected Outcome
Plaques in the bacteria where phage can infect and kill.
III) Reagants Used
BL21
1x LB top agar
Phage: 14 T3
13 T5
10 T2
20OX171
40ØX174
IV) Actual Procedure
We plated together .5mL of BL21 with 1X LB TA.
We separated the plates into different segments and then spot tested the phage.
The plates were then put in a 37°C incubator.
V) Results
No plaques were seen on a uniform bacterial lawn. The control was clear of any contamination or plaques. The phage were not viable.
