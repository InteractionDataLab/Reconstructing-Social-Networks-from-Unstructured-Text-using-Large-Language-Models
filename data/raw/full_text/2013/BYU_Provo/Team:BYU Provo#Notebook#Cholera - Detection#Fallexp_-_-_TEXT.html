Cholera Detection September - October Notebook
Cholera Detection
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
September 1 - September 15
We discovered that lambda is rendered ineffective after electrporation. The children's book for our outreach project was completed. We also streaked cholera next to our lambda containing e. coli and discovered that cholera induces the lysis of our lambda phage. Our first attempts at purifying lambda phage were also made.
Daily log
September 16 - September 30
We did further work on purifying lambda. Also, we have been working on purifying and mutating a membrane protein called SdiA. It recognizes cholera's AHL. We will use it to enable our construct to only respond to cholera's AHLs instead of all AHLs.
