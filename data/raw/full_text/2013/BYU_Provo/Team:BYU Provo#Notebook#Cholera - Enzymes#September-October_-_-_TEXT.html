Protocols
September 1 - September 14
We successfully prepared the DspB and AmyA plasmids to submit to the iGem registry and those to be used in our protein purification. We then were able to purify DspB and AmyA to use in our biofilm assay.
Daily log
September 15 - September 30
We focused on running our biofilm assay and getting data on the degradative enzymatic activity of the DspB and AmyA proteins we have purified.
Daily log
October 1 - October 14
We went to the North American iGem Jamboree and did well enough to make it to the World Championships in November. We got back to the lab extremely excited and motivated. We worked on finalizing our DspB plasmid to get it ready to over express and purify in E. coli.
Daily log
October 15 - October 31
We finished purifying DspB and AmyA, ran Biofilm Assays to determine the effect of these enzymes on the biofilm of V. cholerae, and planned future assays and experiments to continue this area of research.
