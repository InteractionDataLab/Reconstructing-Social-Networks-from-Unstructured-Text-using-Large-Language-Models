Small Phage May - June Notebook: May 27 - June 16 Daily Log
Small Phage
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
5/28/13
- Started three 8mL E coli BL21 liquid culture at around 4pm.
5/29/13
- Continued 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
- Prepared sample for sequencing. This is done as part of 5.20 T7 Minor Capsid Protein PCR
- Dr. Studier responded to our email today! We also received the E coli stains containing plasmids with clone T7 genes.
5/30/13
- Plates from yesterday are taken out of incubation at around 4:00pm
5/31/13
- Discussed results for 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment -> will need to try this one more time with minor adjustment to experimental design: plate -4 dilution using x6 and x8 top agar.
- Discussed plans for next week.
- Made new LB and x6 top agar.
6/2/13
- Made about 20ml of BL21 overnight
6/3/13
- Made new LB plates
- Plated -4 titer on x6 and x8 plates for 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
6/5/13
- Discussed plans for the selection process of 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment and calculated the needed volume of agar, overnight, and phage
- Made 500mL x8 agar
- Performed dilution series to generate enough 200ug -4 phage stock for selection.
6/6/13
- Started approximately 50mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
6/7/13
- Performed the selection process of 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment . Specifically, we plated 45 plates of 200ug mutagen, -4 phage dilution using x8 agar. 5 plates of 0ug, -3 phage dilution were also done a control.
6/9/13
- Started 21mL of BL21 overnight.
6/10/13
- Made 1250mL of x8 top agar
- Attempted to amplify phage from larger plaques in 5.20 Mutagen Concentration Experiment
6/11/13
- Started approximately 70mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight
6/12/13
- Perfected protocol for applying mutagen to phage
- Started 6.12 Mutagen Concentration Test - Second Protocol
6/13/13
- Started approximately 30mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
6/14/13
- Titered the mutagenesis product from Wednesday as part of 6.12 Mutagen Concentration Test - Second Protocol
6/16/13
- Started approximately 100mL of BL21 liquid culture overnight.
