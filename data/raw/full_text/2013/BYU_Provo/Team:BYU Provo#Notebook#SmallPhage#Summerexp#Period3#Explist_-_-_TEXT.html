8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments
We performed this experiment to establish the phage stocks we can use for our modeling project. With this experiment, we were also able to determine the concentration to phage we need to use and several variable we have to control for in our actual experiments.
Detailed procedure: 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments .
8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol
This is our seventh round of mutagenesis. We were able to finalize our protocol for T7 mutagenesis with 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol . However, the Phage Purification Team needed more sample to finalize their CsCl protocol. Thus, we performed this new round of mutagenesis. We also switched to E coli B after establishing in 8.2 Modeling Phage Plaque Sizes - Preliminary Experiments that E coli B also support the growth of T7.
Detailed procedure: 8.14 Mutagen Concentration Test - Seventh Protocol .
