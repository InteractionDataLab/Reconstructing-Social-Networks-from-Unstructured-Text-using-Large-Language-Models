Phage Purification May - June Notebook: Experiments
Phage Purification
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
6.26 Titer
I) Purpose
Test the concentration of purified T7 phage.
II) Expected Outcome
Plaques from the bands in the CsCl gradient where phage were purified.  Expecting plaques down to at least -5 concentration
III) Reagants Used
BL21 freezer stock
LB
1.5x top agar
T7 phage from CsCl gradient
IV) Actual Procedure
Infect 500 µL of LB with 1 loop-full of BL21 freezer stock and put on shaker at 37◦ C for 5 hours.
Plate BL21  on an LB plate with 4.5 mL top agar.
Dilute T7 using a dilution series.
Spot 2 µL of phage from dilution series onto plate using the concentrations 0, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6.
Place in 37◦ C incubator overnight.
V) Results
The titer of T7 phage showed plaques down to a -5 concentration.  This concentration will allow us to perform and EM and examine how pure the phage solution is.
