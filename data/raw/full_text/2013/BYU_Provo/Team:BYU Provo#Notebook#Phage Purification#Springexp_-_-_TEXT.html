May 1 - May 12
This semester we will are perfecting our procedures of purifying T4 and T7 bacteriophage through use of PEG and a CsCl gradient. During this week we began growing cultures to use and infect with phage to begin purification. We were held back waiting for materials, but were able to plan for our future procedures.

Progress Report
May 13 - May 26
We began performing titers to test the viability of phage after purification. We also ran a CsCl gradient, and started another round of PEG purification on T7 and T4 phage.

Progress Report
May 27 - June 9
In these weeks, the CsCl gradients that we ran gave us an idea of the location of bands for both phage types, so that when mutated phage becomes available, we will be able to purify and extract it.We have also started a new round of PEG phage purification to run through the CsCl gradient again.

June 10 - June 23
In these two weeks, we worked on perfecting our techniques and preparing new samples to test. We purified more T7 phage using PEG purification, and it will be ready to run through CsCl gradients in the next two weeks.

June 24 - June 30
This week we finished a CsCl gradient of T7 phage. We successfully banded and extracted the phage. We performed a titer on the extracted phage and had a concentration high enough for an Electron Microscopy sample. We also prepared new bacteria to use with the large phage group.
