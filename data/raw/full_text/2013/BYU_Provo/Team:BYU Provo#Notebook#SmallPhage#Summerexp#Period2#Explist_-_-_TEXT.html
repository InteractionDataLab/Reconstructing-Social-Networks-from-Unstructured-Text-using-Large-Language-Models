7.17 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fifth Protocol
This protocol was testing for how long we should allow the phage to incubate with mutagen.
Detailed procedure: 7.17 Mutagen Concentration Test - Fifth Protocol
7.27 Bacteria Growth Curve After Dilution
By determining the bacterial concentration over time, we can have an accurate estimate of the number of bacteria during the mutagenesis process.
Detailed procedure: Bacteria Growth Curve After Dilution
7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol
This mutagen protocol tests M9 and LB media side by side to see which is better for mutagenesis. We also altered the previous mutagen protocols by incubating phage with bacteria in exponential phase and changing incubation times.
Detailed procedure: 7.29 Mutagen Concentration Test - Sixth Protocol
