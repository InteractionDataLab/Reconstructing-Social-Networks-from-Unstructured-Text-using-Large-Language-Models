July 1 - July 15
A new term and a fresh start! During these two weeks, we performed two more rounds of mutagenesis. With every experiment, we were able to perfect our protocol. Although our results are still not satisfactory, we are getting close! Eventually, we discovered that our phage stock decreased in titer during its preservation inside the fridge. We will propagate our phage and try again!

During these couple weeks, we tried another 2 rounds of mutagenesis. The 5th round didn't work well so we made some major adjustments for the 6th round of mutagenesis. We believe that we were successful in finally mutating the phage and are giving them to the phage purification team to run a cesium chloride gradient on them.

Our goals for these two weeks were very clear. First, we need to generate enough mutagenized phage for the Phage Purification Team to work with. Second, we need to start our modeling project. Hopefully, everything will go according to plan and we will have presentable data soon! As for our modeling project, we have decide to model phage plaque sizes against different variables, such as phage particle size and top agar concentration. We aim to generate a mathematical model that can be used both to optimize phage plaque size for research and characterize our mutant phage.

These two weeks are the interim between summer term and fall semester at BYU. During these two weeks, we focused mostly on finalizing our mutagenesis procedure with the help of Phage Purification Team and their CsCl gradient protocol. We completed our seventh round of mutagenesis and we did see a variability in the size of phage plaques indication variability in phage capsid size. We conducted the eighth round of mutagenesis even more meticulously. Toward the end of these two-week period, we are working on characterizing phage. From our preliminary data, we are seeing the most concentrated phage after mutagenesis so far, which is very promising.
