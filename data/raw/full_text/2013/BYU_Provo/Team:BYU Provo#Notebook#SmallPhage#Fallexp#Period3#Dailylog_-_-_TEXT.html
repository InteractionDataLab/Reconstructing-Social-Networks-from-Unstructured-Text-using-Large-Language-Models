Small Phage September - October Notebook: October 1 - October 15 Daily Log
Small Phage
March-April
May-June
July-August
September-October
10/1/13 - 10/3/13
JL, LP
Worked on putting together Jamboree presentation and poster.
Tried to take EM to verify mutant size - did not work very well: phage titer is too low
10/4/13 - 10/6/13
JL, LP
North America Regional Jamboree! For more information click here .
10/7/13
JL
Started approximately 10 mL E coli B liquid culture overnight.
10/8/13
JL
Started 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage by propagating the mutants.
10/9/13
JL, LP
Purified the propagated mutant from 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage .
Started approximately 20 mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
10/10/13
LP
Performed spot tests to estimate the mutant phage titer in 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage .
Started approximately 20 mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight.
JL
Designed primers for cloning the major and minor capsid proteins into the iGEM registry: BI309 (Xbal) and BI310 (SpeI)
10/11/13
JL, LP
Plated the mutant phage at -7 to verify their phenotypic stability. For specifics, please see 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage .
Designed primers for more accurate sequencing: BI319 (160bp upstream from start codon) and BI320 (-160 downstream from minor capsid protein stop codon)
10/12/13
JL
Started approximately 15mL of E coli B liquid culture overnight
10/13/13
JL
Plated more phage from CsCl gradient to select for mutant. Specifics are recorded in 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage .
10/14/13
JL, LP
Plated more phage to look for mutants as part of 10.8 Characterization of Mutant Phage .
