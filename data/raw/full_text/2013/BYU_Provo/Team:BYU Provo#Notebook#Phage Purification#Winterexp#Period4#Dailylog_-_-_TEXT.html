-We presented our project today.  -There were a few things that we needed to do better.
For one, we need to present better background and show how it ties into our research, specifically the need for a capsid library.
I feel like we could have been a bit more engaging and better rehearsed as well.
We will need to find a way to test the capsids for viability, and somehow characterize them.
