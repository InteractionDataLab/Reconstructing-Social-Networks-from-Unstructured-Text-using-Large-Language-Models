Prepared Phage, T7
IV) Actual Procedure
Gave prepared phage to TEM operator. We had one sample of T7 phage from CsCl purifictaion.

We noticed large amounts of crystal structure and a low concentration of phage. In the future, we will use larger concentrations of phages and run another round of dialysis.
