8/2/13
Today we set up an experiment which we will do on 8/7/13. We re-picked the plaques from the plate of mutagenized phage. The plate was full of variations in plaque sizes. We took the biggest plaques and put them in a mL of LB broth in an eppendorf. We also started to take a closer look at our EMs from Wednesday. We are slowly learning how to use the program image to our best use.
8/5/13
Today we spent class working with ImageJ to measure the phage from the various categories in the cesium chloride gradient.
8/7/13
Today we picked from small plaques and diluted them in 1 mL of LB.  We didn't have grown bacteria so we just put the tubes in the fridge.
We also drafted our project description as a class and posted it to our web site.
8/9/13
We also discussed the need to separate the phage from the CsCl gradient into fractions so we don't risk contaminating the large phage fraction with normal phage from the large, central band.
Results from 8/7/13 plaque test:
8/12/13
Today we gave the phage purification group another round of mutagenized phage to run through a CsCl gradient.  They will separate each band into fractions.
