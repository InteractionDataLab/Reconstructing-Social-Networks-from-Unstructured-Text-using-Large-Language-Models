Future
Tasks we couldn't finish until Asia contest
    •We couldn't double knock down fieF and fur with CRISPRi yet, but we are confident that we can knock down any gene by CRISPRi.
    •In the not so distant future, we would break E. coli 's iron homeostasis using CRISPRi and would uptake more iron into E. coli.
    •Even if E. coli 's iron homeostasis would break, over expression of human ferritin could save E. coli alive.
Tasks that didn't go like we wanted
    •Knocking out gor or trxB didn't lead to a grate change of redox potential like TCO89 overexpression in yeast.
    •It might be hard to oxidize iron in E. coli strain SHuffle® (It isn't oxidized enough). But by over expression of strong oxidase, maybe we can oxidize iron inside E. coli, make magnetite and magnetize E. coli.
What is in future?
    We decided to design & implement BioBricks that are effective for magnetizing E. coli.
    If we can freely magnetize any given cells, together with the cell-surface display techniques, you can establish novel systems for bioseparations. Or, you can simplify the harvesting/ collecting step in the process of bioproduction and bioremediation.
    E. coli would proliferates infinitely if we feed them and give them iron. So if you use it to a magnetic recording media, perhaps the storage capacity could increase infinitely.
