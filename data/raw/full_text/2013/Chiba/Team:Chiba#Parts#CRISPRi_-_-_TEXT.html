CRISPRi
    One of the immune system is CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Cas9 protein and sgRNA (small guide RNA) combine specific sequence and cut it. Using a modified Cas9 lacking endonucleolytic activity, we can use CRISPR as repressor. This system is CRISPRi (CRISPR interference) as shown in Figure 1. Designing guide region of sgRNA and coexpress dCas9, you can knockdown target gene conditionally.
