Repressor switch
Based on the system of iGEM team Slovenia 2012, we adapted the repressor system using TAL A/KRAB. The objective is to reproduce a simple circuit in a Lactobacillus chassis.
The main goal of our xenobiotics biosensor is to detect organochlorides in different concentrations in order to activate a correct answer.
High concentration: When the concentration is high Gal4 DBD could add to UAS and activated linA, a protein wich degrades pesticides, and at the same time express a repressor protein which inhibits the activity of the correpressor that controled the kill switch system.
Low concentration: When the concentration decrease, there is not enought UAS activity in the linA system so the repressor activity stops and the peptides that kill the bacteria starts to be produced.
