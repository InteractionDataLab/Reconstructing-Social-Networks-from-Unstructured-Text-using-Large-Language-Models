Notebook
Developing an iGEM project is no small endeavour. It is at times daunting and the possibility of failure may even loom ominously. The pressure and the sheer amount of work to be done can be demoralizing if you don't have the appropiate preparation.
With that in mind, the best ally of any iGEM team to prevent the project from becoming a stressful experience is organization, and one of the most vital parts of this, is the experiments Notebook. Here we can keep track of everything we do, so that whenever we need to review or remember anything, it is easily accesible. The Notebook holds the record of what we do right and wrong, so that neither we, nor the future iGEM teams, make the same mistakes twice. Instead, the coming generations of iGEMers can focus on building their dreams, reassured by years of experience from previous teams.
