Special Thanks
We would like to give our most significative thanks to all the people that supported and helped us. Specially thanks to the people that work in our university, Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Queretaro, because of them we are right where we are now. At this moment, it is very likely that we are not be able to say whatever we want to them, despite this, we are very happy with their own contributions to our project.
We have to recognize that, specially this people, brought us answers that we were not able to find by ourselves. For us, for our team, and for our proyect, the most important thing they did was their support that came together with very useful advices.
Our special thanks are principally to:
