Future research
Probiotics exhibit different kinds of therapeutic activity in various diseases through the gastrointestinal mucosal immune regulation, or stimulation of the functions of the epithelial barrier. Probiotics represent a reasonable treatment indication for some clinical conditions, and in progress on the investigation of new preparations makes them a promising alternative treatment.
Along with other advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic potential of the probiotics compounds, biomedical technological development has opened new perspectives for therapeutic research microbial strains genetically or synthetically processed, as well as modified systems to allow the arrival of probiotics to specific sites of action in the gut.
Our project opens the possibility of using recombinant strains employing synthetic vectors to promote the expression of microbial products with different traditional functions. In the future views of our project, it can adopt different functions to optimize controlled release of substances sensitive to degradation in the upper sections of the intestine. Suggesting the capacity beyond exposer this days, in the future will be possible through probiotics with these features induce biochemical, microbiological or histological, with a pretty potential clinical benefit in human disease.
