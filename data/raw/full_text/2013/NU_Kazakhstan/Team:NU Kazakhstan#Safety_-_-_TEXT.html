Safety is important
During this project we followed  WHO biosafety guidelines because of the fact that our university is new and does not have Boisafety Committee yet.
1. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab and to the environment?
- Yes, there are some reagents that pose some risk: TEMED is toxic to the environment, flammable, corrosive, and irritant; Bis acrylamyde is irritant, teratogenic and mutagenic; Etidium bromide is carcinogenic; Beta-mercaptoethanol is toxic
2. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
- No, we do not use such materials in our project.
3. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise?
-If the bacteria that we used in our lab is infected with virus, which will result in mutation, this bacteria can potentially become pathogenic.
4. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?
- Yes we had an online CITI collaborative institutional training, which allowed us to gain deeper knowledge about security rules accepted worldwide in scientific research. Upon completion of this program, we have received the Completion Certificates. You can learn more on the official CITI website HERE
