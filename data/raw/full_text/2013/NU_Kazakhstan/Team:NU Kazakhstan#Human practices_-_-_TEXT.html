We want everyone to know about Synthetic Biology and IGEM...
Since we are the representatives of the first IGEM team from Kazakhstan, our team is aiming to deliver more information about Synthetic Biology and IGEM competition at least among the students of Nazarbayev University. Due to the fact that the members of NU_Kazakhstan team have already taken two Synthetic Biology courses, which were specially designed by the request of the group of students interested in IGEM, our team is planning to persuade the students of different majors that taking Synthetic Biology course will be both beneficial and interesting for them. Synthetic Biology combines knowledge from various spheres such as Systems Biology, Classical Molecular Biology, Engineering, Chemistry, Computer Science, etc. Therefore, it gives the opportunity for people from different spheres to apply their knowledge to construct new biological parts, systems,and devices.
