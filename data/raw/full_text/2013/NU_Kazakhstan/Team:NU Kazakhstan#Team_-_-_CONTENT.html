Our team consists of five enthusiastic undergraduate students, who manifest genuine interest in the sphere of Synthetic Biology. We became familiar with IGEM competition in summer 2012 and asked our faculty to organize special Synthetic Biology course in order to learn more about this exciting sphere of biology. Fortunately, our professors also became interested in this competition and were glad to organize two wonderful courses of Synthetic Biology. These courses gave us a great background in many different topics, but the most interesting topic for us was the application of aptamers in diagnosis, treatment and research. Then, in April 2013 we asked Dr. Damira, our mentor, who has been working with aptamers in our University research center, to join her team in lab.

I am a 2nd year biology student at NU. My areas of interest are synthetic biology, bioinformatics and immunology. Briefly about one, I took introduciton into immunology course last year; since then I have plunged into the fascinating science of permanent war within our bodies. My favourite players in this war are the complement system and cell-mediated immunity.

In my free time I like running and doing tai chi. Also, books and friends are among my best companions.

She got her BSc in Biotechnology with Honors and Chemistry minor from Indiana University, Bloomington. During her undergraduate years she did a research on gene alternative splicing events in plants and their role in herbicide resistance. Through her work at Nazarbayev University she became interested in cancer and immunology, and currently she is doing masters in Molecular Biology and working on differential gene expression project using RNA-seq to understand effects of oncoprotein of interest on immune system components. Samal loves science and research, and enjoys the fact that she doesn’t have to make distinction between her work and passion. Her life credo is “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were live forever” (M.Gandhi)
</DIV></DIV><DIV class="smallbox"><DIV class="flleft"><B class="name">Marzhan Sypabekova</B>
My name is Marzhan and I work as a research assistant at NURIS under the project which deals with devising biosensors of different type. Currently I am interested in physical concept of various biological processes. At the moment I am studying how DNA, protein and cell biochips are build, what kind of light matter interactions exist in molecular media. I am also interested in Bio-nano-photonics such as how we can orchestrate fluorescence processes in biological objects.

 I have completed my bachelor degree in Biotechnology and undertaking my master's in Molecular photonics for Telecommunications and Biology. I am glad to be a part of NU iGEM team as I think it is an excellent place for sharing and gaining knowledge, experience and interesting ideas.

My goal is to be an expert who doesn’t think but knows, but I know that I have to think infinitely to become such an expert. So good luck to me! =)
