IGEM
Having been through a happy period in Hong Kong, we get our certification to MIT. Every team worked so hard, and everybody are all so friendly. Of course it is important that we get a gold medal and the certification to go to American, but what really matters is what we saw, who we met, and what we had been through. The whole competition had become a great celebration for every member of iGEM and synthetic biology.
Before our team was founded, we heard that a great deal of energy and money has been consumed in fermentation to cool down the fermenter. There are almost 100,000,000 Yuan wasted every year all around China. So, we planned to design a chassis host which can work in higher temperature with the production of heat controlled.
We have extracted new heat shock proteins (HSPs) from thermophilic bacteria. Then we combine it with an RNA thermometer, letting the HSPs be translated at a suitable temperature to release the burden of the cell in its logarithmic phase.
BIT-China is founded in 28th Feb and our slogan is ‘for one green earth’. To settle the problem of energy consumption of cooling system in fermentation, we set up two artificial systems with the method of synthetic biology.
Coco, an outgoing guy, is a workaholic and his favorite food is LB.
Dr. Iloc is a nice man who likes to help bacteria.
E is a powerful electrical assistant created by Dr. Iloc.
Here is our team uniform:
We designed many souvenirs for our team. There will be a surprise waiting for you during the poster jamboree.

Part 1: Hardworking Coco
Once upon a time, there was a hard working guy called Coco. He was always busy working in his office. As time went by, He got more and more colleague. The workplace become crowd, everyone in the office could not work well.
Part 2: The bothering of warming
So he set an air-conditioner. That stuff cost him a lot of money for electricity. But that was not ended, the electricity consumed by air-conditioner came from the fossil fuel. As a result, the burning of fossil fuel not only damaged the earth but also made everyone outside the house suffer in hot.
Part 3: Help from the doctor
To find a way, Coco found the Doctor for help. The doctor, who has knowledge of synthetic biology, performed an operation on Coco. With the help of the Doctor, Coco did not feel hot at all in the office where he had used to feel scorched. And he found that there were not so many colleagues, but he didn’t lack any, either.
Part 4: The arrival of happiness
According to this, Coco could work without the air-conditioner. There was no sweat from heat, nor conflicts from crowd. Coco and his colleague work happily day by day, and produce a lot of happiness to the world.
