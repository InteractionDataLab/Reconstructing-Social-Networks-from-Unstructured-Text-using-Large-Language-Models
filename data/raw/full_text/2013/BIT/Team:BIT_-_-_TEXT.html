A Brief Introduction of Integrated Sensor for Detection of Milk Product
    As we know, antibiotics are widely used in modern industry to prevent the infection of cow breasts. However, the residual of antibiotics will endanger the health of customers. Therefore, it is necessary to find solution to identify these harmful chemicals, but the method of timely detection of harmful chemicals in products still remains unsolved.
    To solve this problem, our sensor has been divided into two, respectively, of tetracycline and β-lactam . There is a response, for each sensor. They are all assembled in a downstream of the amplification block (amplifier) and the control block (controller). The output signal will be amplified, by adjusting the concentration of IPTG to achieve the adjustment of magnification. Amplifier by the T7 RNA polymerase gene and T7 promoter composition control block is through the downstream of the T7 promoter plus lacO and the addition of regular expression lacI, by adjusting the concentration of IPTG, lacO then adjust the boot situation achieved, the final response module for the green fluorescent protein.
    In order to achieve real-time detection, we also made a biochip which provided a reaction room for both engineering bacteria and samples. Now we are able to detect all these three harmful chemicals with a hand-held electronic equipment made by ourselves.
