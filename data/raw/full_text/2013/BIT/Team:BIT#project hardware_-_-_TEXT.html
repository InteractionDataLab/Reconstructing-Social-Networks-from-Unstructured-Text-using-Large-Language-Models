BIT's measurement
Based on Standard Biomedical Bricks
 
Measurement:
     Ok, now we have contributed a new sensor,  put forward a concept of controlled amplifier and are working on optimizing it. But we think this is just a star, for we can then use this kind of idea to detect nearly all kinds of antibiotics in the future and we are still trying our best to do so.
     But a matter is that we cannot see the florescence in normal condition, just like the picture below, we need UV exiting light, narrowband filter and light sensor to tell us the specific intensity of the light, we also need to calculate the material we want to detect using our mathematical model. That’s so complicated.
     Here, a small, cheap and handheld device, together with our micro chip , is produced which together with our biological core, forms a complete detecting system. If you are interested in the detailed structure of our detecting system, please click Here .
Parameters of the system :
                     Cost: 260RMB/$40 (device & chip).
                     Size: 10cmX6.5cmX5cm
                     Power: 20W Max, 3W Average
                     Functions: User-define mathematical model. Fast detection. Temperature                    Control .
                     Resolution: 5 ng/ml Standard fluorescein sodium, 2~5ng/ml Tet.
     The small device uses normal color sensors and light path similar to UV spectrophotometer, but contains a new, or rather strange mathematical model, a combination of our biological model and relative non-biological equations.

Standard Biomedical Bricks
     Well, as for biological detection of harmful materials, such as antibiotics, heavy metals, aromatic hydrocarbons, radioactive substances, pesticide residues and so on, we need a biological output in color, fluorescence, conductivity, OD value and many other forms.
     But those outputs may be so weak, just like our fluorescence, without the controlled amplifier , it can hardly be seen by our eyes, even under UV light.
     Biomedical machines are used in this case, but  those machines can hardly be found out of the lab.
      So we put forward standard biomedical & biological system, that is: to design a biological core, finishing the corresponding mathematical model, and a standard biomedical external device.
     Just like us, our aim is Practical Application. We created a biosensor, an amplifier and their mathematical models.
     Standard biomedical bricks means the specific mathematical models which suits for our low cost sensors. iGEM is an application-oriented contest, so detection needs to be economic and convenient. Now we have many standard electronic sensors, BIT iGEM team has also optimized a processor which has an interface suiting for any kinds of sensors. What we need to do is to build up our engineered bacteria, burn the standard mathematical models in the processor and connect the suitable sensor to the processor. Then a complete and application-oriented system is built. Just like our detecting system, we have made many editions :
     Then we arrange user-friendly I/O interface to the standard processor, making a colorful cover to the whole system. That means, you can achieve any kinds of detection using the same device, that sounds cool, isn’t it?
     So what we have done at this time is just to simplify the old measurement and provide a new, convenient, economic measurement which detection can be achieved in kitchen. Maybe, some years later, you can see a "bio-antibiotic detector" in supermarket, and let's wait for the coming of that day !
     We have put forward a concept, and now we have make part of the concept into reality. We will go further on our way to overcome any difficulties, and we eagerly need partners to fight with us. If you have interest in it, please CLICK HERE to contact us.
