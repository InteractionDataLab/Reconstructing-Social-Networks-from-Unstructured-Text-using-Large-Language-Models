Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
 researcher safety,
 public safety, or
 environmental safety?
    In order to ensure the safety and health of team members, we strictly observe safety regulations for laboratories. We try to keep our experimental environment tidy and pay attention to the safety protection.
    To guarantee the safety and health of general public, we deal with experimental waste and DNA. We also dispose the experimental bacteria to avoid potential safety hazard.
    Our topic is devoted to the detection of dairy  products, in the whole process we strictly dispose the chemicals and toxic substances. And even though released by design or by accident, we use E. coli as the engineering bacteria, it has no risks to the environment.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
 did you document these issues in the Registry?
 how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
 How could other teams learn from your experience?
    Our BioBrick parts do not raise any safety issues.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
 If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
 If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?     Yes, our institution has a biosafety committee and several professors are monitoring our project. They help us to make sure the safety of the whole process and organize meetings to find hidden safety issues and deal with them in time.
4、Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
    Our engineering bacterium is placed on a chip. By changing the living environment of bacterium, we can control dormant, activation and death of bacteria.
    The teams should make sure their engineering bacteria have no danger to the environment. The mechanism of bacteria to commit suicide should be studied and be used in the design.
