Result
A) Linear Regression
    To indicate the reliability of our system, we conducted experiments with fluorescein sodium solutions of different concentration. The figure below shows the curve of our result, which fits perfectly with the linear curve with an R-squared of 0.9842. The result indicates that our detection system is reliable.
B) Sample Test
    We conducted a sample test, in which we detected the concentration of antibiotics in pure water. In the test, we had seven samples:
1) Five SAFE samples, with only pure water;
2) One HARMFUL sample, with a low concentration of antibiotics;
3) One TOXIC sample, with a high concentration of antibiotics.
Before the test, we did not know which sample was safe and which sample was harmful. Both of the conventional method (VarioskaFlash) and our new method were adopted to detect the concentration of antibiotics in the sample and here is the result. As can be seen from the figure below, the data of our detector was consistent with that of VarioskaFlash, which means our system really worked well.
