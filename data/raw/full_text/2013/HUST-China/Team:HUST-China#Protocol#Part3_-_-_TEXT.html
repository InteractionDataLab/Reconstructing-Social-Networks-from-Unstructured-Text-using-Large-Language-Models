·Methods
Step 1 : PCR amplification with the four pairs of primer set as the template (E.coli genome) will produce four fragments namely ygfG(785bp), ygfH(1478bp), ygfD(995bp) and sbm(2144bp). The conditions of the reaction were listed in table 3 and figure 3-1 displayed the result testified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Step 2 : It is necessary to add PstI and standard restriction enzyme sites to both terminals of each gene. However, ygfD has the sequence that PstI recognize and function. So we obliterated the restriction site by site-directed mutagenesis based on overlap extension PCR. Briefly, target mutation.(TGCA→TCCA) was introduced into primers, and the two previous PCR products were used as template for the third PCR. The final PCR segment with target mutant was then cloned into pMD18-T vector for sequencing. The three PCR system were listed in table 3-4, 3-5,3-6. The final outcome was testified by agarose gel electrophoresis and displayed in figure 3-2.

Step 3 : Retrieve and purify the targets with kits produced by TIANGEN BIOTECH(BEIJING)CO.,LTD. Store the washed genes in -20℃ for next steps.
Step 4 : Conjunct the four genes and pMD18T vectors respectively. Then transfer the conjunctions into DH5αstrain to pick the positive clone after being inoculated in the LB solid culture, 37℃ for one night. To ensure the conjunctions were correct, we confirmed the vectors by colonial PCR. The conditions for conjunction and PCR were listed in the table 3-7, 3-8.

Step 5 : Extract the correct plasmids with kits and sequence part of them to see if there were possible mutations in the target genes.
Step 6 : Digest and purify the genes by restriction enzymes in pMD18T-ygfD (ygfH,ygfG,sbm) vectors and ligate each together with pSB1C3. The conditions for digestion and ligation were listed in the table 3-9,3-10. Then transfer the conjunctions into DH5αstrain to pick the positive clone after being inoculated in the LB solid culture, 37℃ for one night. To ensure the conjunctions were correct, we confirmed the vectors by colonial PCR. Later the pSB1C3 holding ygfD (ygfH,ygfG,sbm) were sent to sequence. See the details in part 2 step 4 and 5.

description
pSB1C3-ygfD(EocRI PstI）
According to Toomas Haller, the enzyme encoded by the                              second gene, ygfD, contains a consensus binding sequence for ATP. They thought it might be a succinate (or propionate)CoA ligase, or a novel (biotin-independent) propionyl-CoA carboxylase.
pSB1C3-ygfH(EocRI PstI）
This gene encode propionyl-CoA:succinate CoA transferase that catalyzes a CoA transferase reaction from propionyl-CoA to succinyl, generating propionate.
pSB1C3-ygfG(EocRI PstI）
The third gene in the operon encoding methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase that catalyzes the decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA
pSB1C3-sbm(EocRI PstI）
Sbm encodes methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase which catalyzes the reversible reaction of succinyl-CoA and methylmalonyl -CoA
