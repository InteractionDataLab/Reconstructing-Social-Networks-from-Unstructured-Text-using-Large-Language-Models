This project was inspired by <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>recent recalls</B></SPAN> of infected beef in Alberta and outbreaks in North America and Europe where water supplies and produce can become contaminated with these pathogens. At the early stages of planning we realized that the industry works reactively to search for <I>E. coli</I> in meat products after harvest. Initially, we brainstormed methods where we could supersede accepted methods such as PCR and bacterial culturing, but as we dived deeper into the problem our lack of understanding of how cattle get turned into the food on plates became apparent. We needed to <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>learn how the beef industry</B></SPAN> works.  To inform our design, we sought out the people who work with cattle every day.</P><H2>The Rancher</H2><P>To start this dialogue, we spoke to <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>Dr. Bob Church</B></SPAN>, a prominent Alberta rancher, researcher, and expert, who has helped bring genetic technologies into the livestock business. We asked him how cattle businesses operate and proposed some ideas to detect <I>E. coli</I> in beef. He answered our questions and spoke about the tremendous <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>sensitivity for testing</B></SPAN><I>E. coli</I> in beef. To remain competitive with current industry methods, we would have to sense <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>five individual bacteria in about a pound of beef!</B></SPAN></P><P>After this reality check, Dr. Church proposed a different approach that shifted the entire focus of our project. He told us to consider developing tools to monitor <I>E. coli</I> in cattle <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>prior to harvest.</B></SPAN> We learned in populations of beef cattle, about five percent of the animals are <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>“super shedders”</B></SPAN> because they pass three to four higher orders of magnitude of dangerous <I>E. coli</I> in their feces.</P><P>Could food safety be improved by separating “super shedders” before they contaminate processing plants? We decided to build a device to rapidly test cattle feces to determine an animal’s shedding level. Our intuition told us that by bringing less <I>E. coli</I> into processing plants would lead to fewer opportunities for contamination. We wondered whether the processing plants would agree.</P><H2>The Meat Processor</H2><P>We proposed this idea to Ryan Clisdell, the Food Safety, Quality &amp; Regulatory manager from <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>Cargill Meat Solutions</B></SPAN> in High River, Alberta, who oversees the processing of 4,500 cattle daily. He took our team into the harvest facility and explained how his team helps prevent <I>E. coli</I> contamination through food safe harvest practices. The mechanization and choreography of the harvest process to lessen opportunities for contamination was remarkable. However, this left us wondering whether addressing the <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>root cause</B></SPAN> of <I>E. coli</I> contamination, by helping prevent or limiting how much is present on live animals, would further help to prevent the chance of food safety illness?</P><P>Our tour of the Cargill plant settled us on developing a system to monitor <I>E. coli</I> shedding in cattle prior to harvest. By developing such a system, we hoped to introduce new tools so that <I>E. coli</I> could be managed at additional points during production. This idea would complement current <I>E. coli</I> management programs used by companies such as Cargill and provide <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>another layer of food safety</B></SPAN>.</P><P>We needed to know where a pre-harvest <I>E. coli</I> management program could be implemented in industry. Cargill gave us positive feedback and told us that super shedders could be screened and processed differently based on <I>E. coli</I>. But we were curious if performing these tests earlier in the supply chain might cause a greater effect on food safety. Would cattle feedlots consider adopting this idea and use the data to isolate super shedders?</P><H2>The Feedlot</H2><P>We took these questions to Dr. Eric Behlke, a veterinarian from <A href="http://feedlothealth.com/">Feedlot Management Services Ltd.</A>, who took us on a tour of Chinook Feeders, a large scale Alberta feedlot which manages 18,000 head of cattle. Dr. Behlke received our idea positively, but he challenged us to build a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>system which could be integrated</B></SPAN> into existing feedlot infrastructure. We saw opportunities where cattle could theoretically be monitored on a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>single animal basis</B></SPAN>, but only at specific periods when they are processed for vaccines and checkups. During the tour, Dr. Behlke also showed how the feedlot has computerized systems to collect and assign data to individual animals.</P><P>We concluded that by combining these routine checkups with the animal information database, feedlots could monitor super shedders in individual animals. However, their feedback revealed three <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>design considerations </B></SPAN>which we would have to incorporate into our prototype. First, it would have to be <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>cheap</B></SPAN> so that it could be scaled-up to entire feedlots. Second, it would have to be <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>easy to use</B></SPAN> by non-laboratory employees in feedlots. And third, it would have to provide a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>definitive measure</B></SPAN> of EHEC shedding levels within an hour to be used during routine check-up procedures.</P><P>From these three discussions, we incorporated feedback from critical beef <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>stakeholders</B></SPAN> covering the complete beef cattle lifecycle. To ensure ease of use, we settled on constructing a prototype resembling a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>home pregnancy test</B></SPAN>, to give an easy to read <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>visual yes or no</B></SPAN> answer as to whether an animal was a super shedder. We decided to make a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>DNA sensor</B></SPAN>. A DNA sensor is more reliable than a protein sensor, as proteins can get degraded during sample preparation. In addition, targeting proteins requires antibodies, which dramatically increase the cost of our system. Our team decided to use an <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>in-vitro based sensor</B></SPAN>, using components extracted from cells, to make the system more portable and reliable in the field. Our selection of common paper materials for the prototype was also influenced on the low cost to build.</P><H2>Other &quot;Steak&quot; holders</H2><P>We believed that we were on the right track to developing something of <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>relevance to the beef cattle industry</B></SPAN>. But we still questioned whether it would be wise to monitor <I>E. coli</I> in individual animals. It was apparent that because of the density of cattle in feedlots, super shedding from a few animals in the pen would expose all neighbouring animals to higher levels of this pathogen.</P><P>To answer these questions, we engaged a company called <A href="http://www.bioniche.com/">Bioniche</A>, a manufacturer of a bovine <I>E. coli O157</I> vaccine. We spoke to Rick Culbert, the President, and Susan Goebel, the <I>E. coli</I> project manager, about where they saw our ideas fitting into the industry. These individuals have worked tirelessly to bring their vaccine to market and are experts in management of <I>E. coli</I> prior to slaughter.</P><P>This meeting was critical because they revealed the <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>broader implications</B></SPAN> which our <I>E. coli</I> monitoring tool could have in the livestock industry. We learned that approximately one-third of <I>E. coli O157</I> illness is due to contaminated beef and another third from contaminated produce. The final third of human infections stem from <I>E. coli</I> in the broader environment, from sources such as contamination of water and exposure of children who touch livestock carrying the bacteria.  We realized that our tool could be used to provide a visual indicator of <I>E. coli</I> shedding, and could have far-reaching implications. With such feedback, our tool could be leveraged with other management strategies to decrease <I>E. coli</I> levels across cattle populations.
</P><P> From our dialogue with key players at in stage of the beef-processing industry, we were able to not only gain validation that our project was needed and worthwhile, but also able to implement <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>multiple design considerations</B></SPAN> into our final product. We hope that this will result in the design and construction of a <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>meaningful and relevant system</B></SPAN> where we can <SPAN class="Yellow"><B>use synthetic biology to solve a very serious problem worldwide.</B></SPAN></P></SECTION><DIV class="printfooter">
