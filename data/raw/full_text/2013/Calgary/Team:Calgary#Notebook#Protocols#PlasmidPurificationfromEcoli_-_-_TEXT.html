Plasmid Purification from E. coli
Reagents and Materials
3mL overnight cultures
P1 : 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 100 µg/ml RNAse A (store at 4°C)
P2 : 200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS
P3 : 3 M KAc (pH 5.5) (store at 4°C)
Protocol
Grow 3mL O/N culture and use 2 mL for below
Pellet culture into 2 mL microfuge tube
Aspire supernatant and repeat if necessary
Re-suspend pellet in 300 µL P1 (Keep on ice)
*Perform next quickly (<1 min)* Add 300 µL P2 → Invert → Add 300 µL P3
Centrifuge 14000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature
Aliquot the supernatant into 1.5 mL microfuge tube (~600-800 µL)
Add 650 µL isopropanol (RT) → Invert → Incubate for 10 min at room temperature
Centrifuge 14000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C → Aspirate
Wash pellet with 70% cold (-20°C) EtOH (~500 µL)
Centrifuge 14000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C → Aspirate
Air-dry pellet (place tubes upside down for about an hour)
Re-suspend (by flicking) in double distilled water (30 µL)
Leave standing at RT for a few minutes to facilitate dissolving of plasmid in ddH2O (deionized water)
Run 3-4 µL on gel to check quality AND/OR Measure concentration (A260/A280)
