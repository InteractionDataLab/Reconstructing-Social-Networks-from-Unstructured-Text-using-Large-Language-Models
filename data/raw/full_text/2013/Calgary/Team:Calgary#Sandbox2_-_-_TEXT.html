I'm a catchy tagline.
This is the place where you can put a brief descriptive blurb that describes what this page is all about. Try to keep it short and sweet since we want this to grab the readers' attention and let them read further down. What is the purpose of this page? You're trying to be a little edgy, right?
This is another body of content. Add whatever you feel like here.
Note how all of your content is going to be kept between HTML tags. SIDENAV specifies the left side navigation bar, ABSTRACT specifies the green box above this, and CONTENT is everything else you're reading right now. While editing this page, please be sure to keep the various lines in the code as clean as possible.
