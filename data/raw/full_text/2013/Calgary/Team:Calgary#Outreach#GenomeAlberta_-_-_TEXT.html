Genome Alberta
To continue last years' work we formed a collaboration with Genome Alberta to engage the scientific community in Alberta. Through the Genome Alberta website we published blogs detailing what our project is and our progress at various points. By interfacing our work through their website we were able to interact with the large base of scientists and industry members that work with Genome Alberta. As well as providing a distraction from the PCRs and genome preps of scientists in Alberta, we raised awareness of the issues surrounding EHEC contamination of beef and how we are aiming to help. The fruits of our collaboration with Genome Alberta are linked below.
