Colony PCR
This Summer, we did colony PCR with Homemade Taq and Comercial Taq, so we have two different protocols
Colony PCR with Homemade Taq
Mix (per reaction)
2.0µL 10x Taq Buffer
0.4 µL 50mM MgCl2
0.4µL 10mM dNTPs
0.8µL 10µM Primer Forward
0.8µL 10µM Primer Reverse
0.4µL 10x diluted Homemade Taq
12.2µL ddH2O
Protocol
Aliquot 4µL of ddH2O into a 0.2mL PCR tube
Using a pipette tip, gently touch one of your colonies and mix the cells into the water
To expose the DNA through cell lysis, place the tubes in the thermocycler at 95°C for 10 min
Add 17µL of your mix in each tube
Set the following program in the thermocycler:
Stage 1 (1 cycle): 95°C for 3 min
Stage 2 (36 cycles): 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1min/kb
Stage 3 (1 cycle): 72°C for 10 min
Hold at 4°C
Run the products in a agarose gel
Colony PCR with Comercial Taq
Mix (per reaction)
5.0µL 10x Taq Buffer
1.5 µL 50mM MgCl2
1.0µL 10mM dNTPs
1.0µL 10µM Primer Forward
1.0µL 10µM Primer Reverse
0.2µL 10x diluted Homemade Taq
40.0µL ddH2O
Protocol
Aliquot 4µL of ddH2O into a 0.2mL PCR tube
Using a pipette tip, gently touch one of your colonies and mix the cells into the water
To expose the DNA through cell lysis, place the tubes in the thermocycler at 95°C for 10 min
Add 49.7µL of your mix in each tube
Set the following program in the thermocycler:
Stage 1 (1 cycle): 95°C for 3 min
Stage 2 (36 cycles): 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1min/kb
Stage 3 (1 cycle): 72°C for 10 min
Hold at 4°C
Run the products in a agarose gel
