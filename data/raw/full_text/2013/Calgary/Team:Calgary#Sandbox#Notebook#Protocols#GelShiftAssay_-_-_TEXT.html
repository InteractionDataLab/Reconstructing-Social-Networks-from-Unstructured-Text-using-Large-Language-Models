Gel Shift Assay
Reagents and Materials
1.3% agarose gel
DNA of interest
Purified protein sample
10x Buffer
120mM Tris Cl
600mM KCl
20mM DTT
0.5% NP-40
1mg/mL BSA
50% Glycerol
50 mM MgCl2
2mM EDTA
Fill up to desired volume with water
pH = 7.5
Protocol
Perform a Bradford Assay to the protein concentration
Add 2µL of 10X Buffer, 55pM of DNA, 0.01 to 2500nM of Protein, and fill up to 20µL with ddH2O. Mix thoroughly
Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark
Place at 4°C for 30 minutes
Run on a 1.3% agarose gel at 50V
