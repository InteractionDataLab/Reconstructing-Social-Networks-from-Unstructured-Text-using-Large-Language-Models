TALEs
Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are naturally occurring proteins that bind to DNA. These proteins are found in Xanthomonas species, a plant pathogen, and originally serve as a pathogenic factor. However recently we have discovered the modular property of TALEs which make them particularly amenable to genetic engineering and customization.
We have engineered a TALE that binds to the shiga toxin II gene, Stx2 in E. coli and other entero-haemorrhagic bacteria.
