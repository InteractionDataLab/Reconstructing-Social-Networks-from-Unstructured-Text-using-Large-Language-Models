Kapa PCR (for DNA constructions)
Mix (per reaction)
5.0µL 5x Kapa Hifi Buffer
0.75µL 10mM dNTPs
0.75µL Primer Forward
0.75µL Primer Reverse
0.5µL Kapa Hifi DNA polymerase
10 to 50ng of DNA
ddH2O up to 25µL
Protocol
Add the mix to each tube
Set the following program in the thermocycler:
Stage 1 (1 cycle): 95°C for 2 to 5 min
Stage 2 (30 cycles): 98°C for 20 sec, 55°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 1min/kb
Stage 3 (1 cycle): 72°C for 1 to 5 min
Hold at 4°C
Run the products in a agarose gel
