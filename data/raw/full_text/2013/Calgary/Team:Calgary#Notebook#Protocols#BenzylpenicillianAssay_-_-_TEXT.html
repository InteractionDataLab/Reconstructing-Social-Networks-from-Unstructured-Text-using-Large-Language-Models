Benzylpenicillin Assay
Reagents and Materials
96-well plate
0.5% m/v Phenol Red
Benzylpenicillin
NaOH 1M
Purified Beta-lactamase 1µg/µL
pH strip
Protocol
Add different amounts Beta-lactamase to the wells (we added 5µg to 25µg of purified TALE A-linker-beta-lactamase)
To a tube add 16.6mL of ddH2O (deionized water), 2mL of 0.5% m/v Phenol Red and 1.2g of benzylpenicillin. Add the pH to 8.5 with NaOH 1M
Add 100µL of the solution above to each well
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
Observe color change from red to yellow
Measure pH with a pH strip (the pH is expected to drop)
