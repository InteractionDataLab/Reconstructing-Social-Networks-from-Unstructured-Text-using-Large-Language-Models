Prussian Blue Ferritin Synthesis
Reagents and Materials
Horse Spleen Ferritin (47mg/mL)
Hydrogen Chloride (pH 3.0)
K4Fe(CN)6 (0.025M)
Sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer (pH 3.6)
Add 20µL horsespleen ferritin (47mg/mL) to a solution of 20mL HCl(pH 3.0) and 150µL K4Fe(CN)6 (0.025M).
Incubate for 12 hours at 4℃ to allow the synthesis to occur.
Dialyze the solution (or aliquots of the solution) using dialysis tubing and sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer (pH 3.6) for 8 hours. Replace the buffer and allow it to dialyze over night. The buffer used can be changed depending on the future uses planned for the Prussian blue ferritin. Dialysis specifications should be followed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the tubing.
