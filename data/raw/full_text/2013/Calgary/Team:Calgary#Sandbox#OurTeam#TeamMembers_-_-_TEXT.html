Iain George
Biological Sciences (2nd Year Masters)
This is my second year on our iGEM team at the University of Calgary.  I am a master student in biological sciences at the U of C. My research is in investigating how RNA-binding proteins act to regulate various genes at the post-transcriptional level. Previously, I worked as a member of the Biofilm Research Group at the U of C, studying how bacterial biofilms could be applied to bioremediate environmentally contaminated sites. When I am not living/sleeping/supervising in the lab, you may find me in the mountains surrounding Calgary hiking and trying my hand at photography.

Wm. Keith van der Meulen
Electrical & Computer Engineering (2nd Year)
This summer, I have been responsible for building the physical prototypes for our system and designing and coding this website. I am pursuing a career in aeronautical robotics R&D, so I have found my time working in a research setting with iGEM this year very valuable. Besides staying up until 2 a.m. coding, I also spend my time running Foster Bikes , a non-profit, Seattle-based company I co-founded. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, skiing, and trying to learn about this weird thing non-engineers call a "social life".

Chris Wintersinger
Biomedical Sciences (4th Year)
This is my second year on the iGEM Calgary team and I have my hands in every part of the project. Formally though, I am leading team ferritin and have been nicknamed "Christoferritin" by my team mates. When I am not slaving in the early morning hours in our lab, you'll find me travelling on remote logging roads in the backwoods of Alberta, or covered in grease working on my pickup truck. After I conquer iGEM, I hope to start a career as a hand model, enter a travelling carnival, or failing those, continue my journey in synthetic biology as a graduate student.

Robert Mayall
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Recent Alumni)
This is my third year in iGEM, and I am one of the advisors to the team this year. That means I get to yell slightly more than I did in previous years. When I'm not sitting around in a lab, I can be found swimming laps in a nearby pool or catching up on some of the sleep I lost during wiki freeze from the last few years. One day I want to grow up and face the real world, but I will put that off as long as possible by going to grad school.

Himika Dastidar
Microbiology, Immunology, and Infectious Diseases (1st Year Masters)
I am an iGEM veteran and this is my 3rd year doing iGEM. This year I came back as a graduate supervisor. I get to supervise the kids this year. In my spare time or the lack thereof I study cancer biology, skate around in quad skates or you can find me drinking a beer at the bar.

Taylor Remondini
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year with the iGEM Calgary team and I have been involved primarily with the ferritin , linker , and wiki design elements of the project. My main interest has been in testing the potential of chemically modified ferritin nano-particles as a reporter system for our project. Between working in the lab and harassing Keith about the design of the wiki you can find me on the golf course or ensuring that my car is spotless. Going into the future I am pursuing entrance into medical school to further my career. iGEM has been an invaluable experience for many of the trials I will face going forward with life.
Denny Hoang
Cellular, Molecular, & Microbial Biology (4th Year)
This is my first year in the iGEM team and I've largely played a role in the ferritin part of the team. I've been previously exposed in a lab involving environmental microbiology, thus this experience has given me the opportunity learn many different techniques and skills used in synthetic biology.  In my spare time I've enjoyed playing soldier, snowboarding and reading novels.

Ruth Moges
Biological Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM. I've mostly been helping out the undergrad supervisors with their arbitrary needs, so I've been a part of the TALEs, Ferritin and Linker teams. I've loved the opportunity to work in a lab, this is my first year doing so independently. Later in life I hope to become an optometrist, looking into people's eyes is one of my favourite pastimes. When not in the lab though, I am doing other fun activities like reading, hanging out with my friends and soaking up as much vitamin D as I can before winter comes!

Dr. Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (Professor)
I have been involved with teaching/mentoring in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since 2003, primarily to develop and deliver the Honours Cell & Molecular Biology course, a core requirement in the curriculum. I have taught every offering of that course and received numerous accolades from the Faculty and the students, most recently winning the Teaching Excellence Award for 2010-2011 from the University of Calgary Students Union. This is my third year as an iGEM Instructor and my interest in the program springs from my belief in the value of inquiry as a means to getting students engaged in the pursuit of knowledge and developing habits of becoming lifelong learners.

Justin Dole
Biological Sciences (2nd Year)
Heading into my second undergraduate year, I can undoubtedly say that the past few months have helped put my academic knowledge into context. I held various roles this summer, but was ultimately in charge of qualitative modelling using Autodesk Maya. This has been my first year with iGEM; the exposure to various disciplines has allowed me to see the interconnectivity between synthetic biology, engineering, and business. Besides waiting for the lab computer to process 22GB of RAM, I take pride in eating well, exercising regularly, sleeping in, and picking flowers for my Mom. I two-strap my backpack, have a keen interest in entrepreneurship, technology, and medicine, and love anything with an engine to the point that I consider myself obsessed.
Su Wang
Chemical Engineering (4th Year)
I am a chemical engineering student with a specialization in biomedical engineering. Prior to join iGEM I have been doing researches in chemical engineering labs for thermodynamics or in-situ oil upgrading. Those were professor-driven research projects where even though I had good experiences, there was little I could do to test my own hypothesis. That's why I came for iGEM; for the student driven research aspect. Here I wish to combine with what I have learned from system biology class, with my training in modelling, to work on things that interest me!
Sharon Feng
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This summer was my first year being involved in iGEM and a wet lab setting. I was fortunate to be a member of the TALEs team where I have learned so much about synthetic biology, bacterial genetics, and general lab practices. Last year, I was involved with clinical studies of children with inflammatory bowel disease at the Alberta Children's Hospital. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
Amanda Zucoloto
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year on iGEM and I have been working with TALEs, which involved alternative cloning strategies and lots of fun time doing protein work over the Summer. When I am not pippeting in the lab to the sound of Backstreet Boys, I spend my time working out, exploring Canada and catching up with family and friends who are all the way back in Brazil. Even though I still have a couple months here in Calgary, I can't wait to come back as a graduate student!
Julie Osgood
Biomedical Sciences (3rd Year)
This is my first year with iGEM and I have spent my summer focusing on the TALE aspect of our project. I devoted my time to designing the E. coli target sequences and putting together our TALE constructs. When I’m not redoing all my experiments that didn’t work, I enjoy dancing, reading, and watching Battestar Galactica. I have spent my past couple summers working in research labs, but I loved having the opportunity to join a student driven research team. In the future I hope to be a professional Quidditch player or a geneticist.
