Gibson Assembly
Protocol
Assembly fragments were designed to have 35-40bp overhanging regions of complementary in the primers
PCR fragments were generated using a KAPA HiFi polymerase reaction. Fragments were verified on an agarose gel and treated with DpnI restriction enzyme
The following reaction was set up: 0.5 pmols of linear fragments, at least two fold excess of inserts and 75ng of vector backbone; 10μL of 2x NEB Gibson assembly master mix; water to bring entire reaction to 20μL
Gibson reaction was run in a thermocycler at 50°C for 1 hour
2μL of the above reaction was transformed into NEB 5-alpha competent E.coli
Cells on plates were subsequently screened using standard colony PCR and verification digest methods
