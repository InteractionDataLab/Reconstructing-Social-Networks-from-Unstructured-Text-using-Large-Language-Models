O'Brien Centre for the BHSc
The O'Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences is a part of the University of Calgary, located in the Foothills campus. It is responsible for providing iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded in part by a generous $5-million donation by David and Gail O’ Brien, after whom the Centre was named. David O'Brien has been a member of the University's Board of Governors, while Gail O'Brien has chaired the Faculty of Medicine's Dean's Advisory Council. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch research, interdisciplinary research, and education. It is responsible for providing approximately $9-million/year for researchers. The 2012 iGEM team thanks O’Brien Centre for its generous contribution of the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentship as well as lab space this year.
