Functionality Assay On Nitrocellulose
Reagents and Materials
Nitrocellulose paper
Purified protein
FAM-labelled double stranded DNA
1x TALE binding buffer
TBST buffer
5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer
Protocol
Cut thin strips of nitrocellulose paper; thin enough to fit into a 2mL tube
Blot enough protein on the strip
put the strips in a container and block them with 5% skimmed milk in TBST buffer for at least 30 minutes
Discard the milk and wash the strips 3 times with TBST buffer
make a 1.6 mM solution with the FAM-lablled DNA in 2mL tubes. The FAM-lablled DNA must be protected from light.
Insert the strips into the DNA tubes and let them soak for appropriate length of time
Wash the strips twice with 1x TALE-binding buffer.
Image the strips.
