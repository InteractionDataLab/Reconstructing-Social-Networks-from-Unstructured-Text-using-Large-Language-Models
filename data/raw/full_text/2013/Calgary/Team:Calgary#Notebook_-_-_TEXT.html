Notebook
Our team has been working hard all summer, and it wasn't only on the experiments shown on other parts of our wiki. Here in the notebook section you can find information on our day-to-day activities, including the many failed PCRs and crooked gel pictures. The journal is broken down into the sub-groups of our project to make it easier to track the progress of one project over time.
You can also find all of the protocols that we used and developed over the summer, a list of all the parts we submitted this year, and all of the references used on our wiki.
