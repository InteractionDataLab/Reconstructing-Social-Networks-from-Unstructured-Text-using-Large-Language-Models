Mini Expression
We used this protocol to define the optimum conditions for expression of our constructs.
Reagents and Materials
Overnight cultures of protein-producing bacteria
LB broth
IPTG (Isopropyl-Beta-D-Thiogalactoside)
Protocol
Make 2mL overnight cultures of your protein-producing bacteria
Subculture in 10mL of LB broth
When OD600 is between 0.3 and 0.5, induce the culture with IPTG
To determine optimum conditions for expression, use different time point of induction (e.g. 4h, 8h and 12h) and different concentration of IPTG (e.g., 0.1mM, 0.4mM and 0.8mM)
