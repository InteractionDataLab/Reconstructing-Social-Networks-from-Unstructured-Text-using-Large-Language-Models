Biosensor Database
The Calgary and Paris-Bettencourt teams developed a comprehensive, open source database organizing all biosensors and related components in iGEM since 2007. This tool allows users to filter projects by criteria including inputs, outputs, application, and their awards in iGEM. SensiGEM is a resource which future teams can use to find useful sensory components and showcase their biosensor projects.
