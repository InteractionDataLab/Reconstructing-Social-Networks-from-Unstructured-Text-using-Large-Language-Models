Bradford Assay
Reagents and Materials
96-well plate
Bradford Reagent
BSA standards (e.g., 0.2mg/mL, 0.5mg/mL, 1.0mg/mL and 1.5mg/mL)
Protein samples
Spectrophotometer
Protocol
Add 20µL of standards (in triplicates) and samples into the wells
Add 200µL of Bradford Reagent to each well and incubate at room temperature for 10 min
Read the absorbance at 595nm
Plot a standard curve to obtain a linear equation
Use the linear equation to calculate the protein concentration of each sample
