Ampicillin Survival Assay 1
We used this protocol to verify if E. coli transformed with the β-lactamase gene was able to express the enzyme and survive in media with ampicillin.
Reagents and Materials
LB Broth
Ampicillin (100mg/mL)
Chloramphenicol (30mg/mL)
Falcon tubes
E. coli transformed with pLacI resistant to chloramphenicol but not ampicillin
E. coli transformed with RFP resistant to chloramphenicol but not ampicillin
E. coli transformed with β-latacmase ( pLacI +beta-lactamase+His) resistant to chloramphenicol
Protocol
Add 5mL of LB Broth to 9 Falcon tubes and 3µL of chloramphenicol to 6 Falcon tubes only
In 3 of the tubes (2 of them with chloramphenicol and 1 with LB Broth only), add colonies of E. coli transformed with pLacI
In 3 of the tubes, add colonies of E. coli transformed with RFP
In 3 of the tubes, add colonies of E. coli transformed with β-latacmase ( pLacI +beta-lactamase+His)
Incubate the tubes overnight in a shaker at 37°C
Spin down the tubes and resuspend cells in 5mL of fresh LB Broth
Add ampicillin to the tubes that had no antibiotic on it and to one of the tubes that had chloramphenicol on it. After that, for each group you will have one with Amp only, one with Chlor only and a third one with Amp + Chlor
Measure the OD at 600nm in a spectrophotometer in different time points
Incubate the tubes for 1h at 37°C
For the positive control, inoculate a tube that doesn’t have protein on it with a colony of  your bacteria resistant to both antibiotics
Add colonies of your bacteria resistant to chloramphenicol but not ampicillin to the other tubes
Grow the cells overnight
