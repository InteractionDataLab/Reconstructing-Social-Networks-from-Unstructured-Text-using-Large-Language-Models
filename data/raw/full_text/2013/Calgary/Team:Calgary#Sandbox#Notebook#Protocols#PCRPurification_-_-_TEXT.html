PCR Purification
For PCR purification, we used the E.Z.N.A.™ Cycle-Pure Kit. This kit is used to purify PCR products, as well DNA products in enzymatic reactions, particularly, restriction digests. We followed the manufacturer’s Spin Protocol.

Protocol
Determine the volume of the PCR reaction, transfer the sample into a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube, and add 4-5 volumes of Buffer CP
Vortex thoroughly to mix
Spin down tubes shortly
Place a HiBind DNA column in a provided 2ml collection tube
Add 100µl Equilibration Buffer to the column
Incubate at room temperature for 4 minutes
Spin at maximum speed for 20 seconds
Apply the sample to the HiBind DNA column and centrifuge at 10,000x g for 1 min at room temperature
Discard liquid
Wash the HiBind DNA column by adding 700µl of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol and centrifuge centrifuge at 10,000x g for 1 min at room temperature
Discard liquid and repeat last step with 500µl of DNA Wash Buffer
Discard liquid and centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA column for 2 min at maximum speed to dry the column matrix
Transfer HiBind DNA column to a clean 1.5mL tube and elute with 30-50µL of ddH2O
Use a spectrophotometer to measure the concentration and the purity of your plasmid
