Protocol
Put two gel glass pieces together in the correct orientation  (should be small space between them) and clip into the gel apparatus
Add about 5 mL of separating gel in between the two glass pieces (ensure it does not leak)
Add a thin layer of isopropanol on top of the separating gel to form a smooth line
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Rinse out the isopropanol with water
Add about 2 mL of the stacking gel on top of the separating gel and add the gel comb
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Place the gel into the gel running apparatus and lock it in place. Ensure the side with the larger piece of glass is facing outward. If there is only one gel, add empty glass pieces to the other side
Put the gel into the gel box and fill with 1x SDS Running Buffer. Ensure the middle section between the gels is filled with buffer
Load samples
Run gel at 100V until samples leave the well and increase the voltage to 150V. Or run the gel at lower voltages (~90V) to get cleaner bands
When the gel is done running, fix it with destaining solution (50% water, 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min
Stain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1h
Distain the gel with water or destaining solution
