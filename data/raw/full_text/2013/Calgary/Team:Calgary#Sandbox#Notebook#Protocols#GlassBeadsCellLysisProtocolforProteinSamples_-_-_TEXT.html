Glass Beads Cell Lysis Protocol for Protein Samples
Reagents and Materials
0.1m diameter glass beads
Lysis Buffer
Overnight induced cultures
1.5mL tubes
Protocol
Culture and induce protein-producing bacteria
Centrifuge cells at max for 10 minutes. Discard supernatant
Resuspend cells in 2mL of lysis buffer
In a 1.5mL tube, add ~0.5mL of glass beads and 1mL of cells resuspended in lysis buffer
Leave on ice for 5 min. Leave on BeadBeater or Vortex for 5 min. Repeat this cycle 6 times
Centrifuge at max for 20 minutes
Transfer supernatant (crude lysate) to a new tube and discard the glass beads
