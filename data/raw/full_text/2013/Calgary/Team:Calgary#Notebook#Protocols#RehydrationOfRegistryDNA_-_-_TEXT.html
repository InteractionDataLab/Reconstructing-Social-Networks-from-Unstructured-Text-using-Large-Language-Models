Rehydration of Registry DNA
Biobrick parts are shipped from the registry in a dehydrated form. As such they must be rehydrated before they can be used.
Reagents and Reagents
Biobrick parts
ddH2O (deionized water)
Protocol
Puncture a hole through the foil with a pipette tip into the well that corresponds to the Biobrick - standard part that you want
Add 10 μL of ddH2O (deionized water)
Let the water incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
Take 1 μL DNA and transform into your desired competent cells, plate out onto a plate with the correct antibiotic and grow overnight. Your goal here is to obtain single colonies
