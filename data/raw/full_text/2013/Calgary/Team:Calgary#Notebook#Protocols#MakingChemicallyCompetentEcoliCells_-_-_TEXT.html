Making Chemically Competent E. coli Cells
Reagents and Materials
Top10 E. coli cells
LB Broth
50mM CaCl2 solution (store at 4°C)
Protocol
Inoculate 5-10 mL LB at 37°C while shaking
Subculture 1 mL of bacteria solution into 50 mL LB broth at 37°C; while shaking until OD600 is 0.4-0.6 (This step should require approximately 2.5 hours)
Centrifuge the subculture at 10 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes
Re-suspend pellet in 12.5 mL of cold CaCl2 (50 mM) and leave on ice for 10 minutes
Centrifuge at 10 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes and re-suspend in 2 mL of cold CaCl2 (50 mM, 15% glycerol solution)
Leave on ice for at least 30 minutes and then aliquot 200 μL and freeze at -80°C
