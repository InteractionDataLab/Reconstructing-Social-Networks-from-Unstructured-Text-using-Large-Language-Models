Benzylpenicillin Assay 2
Reagents and Materials
96-well plate
Bromothymol Blue pH Indicator
60 mg/mL Benzylpenicillin
Purified β-lactamase 1µg/µL
Commercial β-lactamase 1µg/µL
pH 8 Water
Protocol
Dilute β-lactamase to the appropriate concentrations in 100 µL of pH 8 water. Add this to the wells.
Add an additional 50 µL of pH 8 water to the wells.
Add 10 µL of bromothymol blue pH indicator to these wells.
Add 100 µL of 60 mg/mL benzylpenicillin to the wells.
Measure the change from blue to yellow using a spectrophotometer at an absorbance wavelength of 616 nm.
