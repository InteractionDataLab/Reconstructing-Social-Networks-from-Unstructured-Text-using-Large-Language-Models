Our Team
This year we have a very diverse team of people, with individuals in all years of study, and from varying faculties across campus. Our team consists of undergraduates, graduate students, professors, and advisors, who have all come together to create our FerriTALE. Each team member worked on a separate aspect of our project. There was a team for our detector , reporter , linker , modeling , prototype , and human practices . Some of us dedicated our time to one part of our project, while others tried their hand at everything. Each team member brought their own skills and knowledge, and sacrificed their time to make our FerriTALE become a reality. To get to know each team member and their contributions, click here .
