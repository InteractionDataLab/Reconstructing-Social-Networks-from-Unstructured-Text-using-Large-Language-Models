5% Native PAGE Gel (Separating)
833 mL Acryl/Bis (40%)
4112 mL 0.375M Tris (pH 8.8)
50 µL 10% APS
5 µL TEMED
4% Native PAGE Gel (Stacking)
400 mL Acryl/Bis (40%)
2567 mL 0.375M Tris (pH 8.8)
30 µL 10% APS
3 µL TEMED
Native PAGE Running Buffer
25mM Tris
192mM Glycine
4x Native PAGE Loading Dye
62.5mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)
25% Glycerol
1% Bromophenol Blue
Stains
Coomassie Brilliant Blue
Potassium ferrocyanide
Hydrogen Chloride
Protocol
Put two gel glass pieces together in the correct orientation  (should be small space between them) and clip into the gel apparatus
Add about 5 mL of separating gel in between the two glass pieces (ensure it does not leak)
Add a thin layer of isopropanol on top of the separating gel to form a smooth line
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Rinse out the isopropanol with water
Add about 2 mL of the stacking gel on top of the separating gel and add the gel comb
Wait for the gel to solidify (~ 20 minutes)
Place the gel into the gel running apparatus and lock it in place. Ensure the side with the larger piece of glass is facing outward. If there is only one gel, add empty glass pieces to the other side
Put the gel into the gel box and fill with 1x Native PAGE Running Buffer. Ensure the middle section between the gels is filled with buffer
Load samples, DO NOT HEAT SAMPLES
Run gel at 100V until samples leave the well and increase the voltage to 150V. Or run the gel at lower voltages (~90V) to get cleaner bands
When the gel is done running, remove gel and stain with either the protein stain or iron stain
Protein Stain
Stain gel in Coomassie Brilliant blue for approximately 1 hour
Destain gel with destaining solution
Iron Stain
Prepare 25mL 4% hydrogen chloride and 25mL 2% potassium ferrocyanide
Mix solutions right before use, and stain gel using the resulting solution for approximately 1 hour
This gel does not require a destain
