Reagents and Materials
Induced cultures of protein-producing bacteria
20% w/v sucrose, 0.03 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0
Ice-cold 5mM MgSO4
Protocol
Culture and induce protein-producing bacteria
Spin down the cells for 10 min at 4,000 rpm
Re-suspend pellet in 10 ml of 20% w/v sucrose, 0.03 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature
Pellet cells at 4C for 10 minutes at 4,000 rpm
Re-suspend pellet in 200µL of ice-cold 5mM MgSO4 and transfer into an eppendorf tube and let sit on ice bath for 30 minutes
Spin at >13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the supernatant and transfer to new tube
Do SDS PAGE Gel analysis and store as required
