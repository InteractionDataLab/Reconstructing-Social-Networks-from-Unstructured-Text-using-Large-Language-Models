The University
Calgary is a city located 100 kilometers east of the Rocky Mountains in the southern part of Alberta, Canada. With a population of just over 1.2 million people, Calgary is the fifth largest metropolitan area in Canada. Due to large oil and agriculture industries, Calgary has the strongest economy in Canada. Ranked the cleanest city on earth by the Mercer Global Report and one of the five most livable cities on earth, Calgary is currently the second fastest growing city in North America.
Located in the northwest quadrant of the city, the University of Calgary, established in 1966, is quickly becoming one of the top universities in Canada. With over 30 000 students enrolled in 14 faculties, the university boasts over 30 research institutions and centers and 140 000 alumni. Research is one of the University of Calgary’s top priorities as the school aims to be one of the top five research institutions in Canada by the university’s 50th anniversary in 2016.
