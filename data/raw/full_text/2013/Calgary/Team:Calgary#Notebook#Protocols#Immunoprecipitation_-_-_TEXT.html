Immunoprecipitation
Materials:
Cell lysates
Protein A conjugated agarose beads
Antibody of interest:0.5-1ug/ reaction
lysis buffer: 50 mM NaH2PO4 300 mM NaCl 10 mM imidazole Adjust pH to 8.0 using NaOH.
0.5 mm glass beads
Rotator
All reagents to run a western blot
Procedure
Grow up overnight cultures in the correct selection marker.
Spin down the pellets next morning and lyse the cells using bead beaters
Incubate sample with glass beads and lysis buffer containing 100uM protease inhibitor for 5 mins on ice and then shake for 5 minutes on a bead beater. Repeat twice.
Do a Bradford assay to determine the protein concentration of your samples
Combine 500ug-1000ug of each lysate
Amount of protein you add for each lysate will vary upon the abundance of your protein of interest in the lysate
Add the antibody (0.5-1ug) that will be used for pulldown into each sample.
Antibody amounts can vary depending on the protein you pull down and the abundance of the protein in the lysates.
Add sepharose beads conjugated to Staphylococcus aureus protein A to the solution. Protein A binds to the Fc region of antibodies and will pull down the antibody bound to your protein.
Incubate at 4 degrees for 2-4 hours on a rotator.
Wash three times with TBST and spin at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes.
Elute with 5x lamelli buffer with Beta- mercaptoethanol and boil at 96 C for 5 mins and run a western blot .
