Glass Beads Cell Lysis Protocol for Protein Samples
Reagents and Materials
0.1mm diameter glass beads
Lysis buffer
Overnight induced cultures
1.5mL tubes
Protocol
Culture and induce protein-producing bacteria.
Centrifuge cells at max for 10 minutes. Discard supernatant.
Resuspend cells in 1:10 dilution of lysis buffer (Lysis buffer composed of: 50mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 10mM imidazole, pH 8.0).
In a 1.5mL tube, add ~0.5mL of glass beads and 1mL of cells resuspended in lysis buffer.
Leave on ice for 5 min. Leave on BeadBeater or Vortex for 5 min. Repeat this cycle 2 times.
6. Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 20 minutes.
Transfer supernatant (crude lysate) to a new tube and discard the glass beads.
