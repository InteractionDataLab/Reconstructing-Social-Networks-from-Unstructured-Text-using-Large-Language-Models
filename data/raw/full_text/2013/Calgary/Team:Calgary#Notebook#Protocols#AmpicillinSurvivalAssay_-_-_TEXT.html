Ampicillin Survival Assay
We used this protocol to verify if, after protein purification, beta-lactamase was functional when linked to one of our TALEs.
Reagents and Materials
LB Broth
Ampicillin (100mg/mL)
Chloramphenicol (30mg/mL)
Falcon tubes
Bacteria resistant to chloramphenicol but not ampicillin
Bacteria resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol
Purified beta-lactamase protein
Protocol
To each Falcon tube, add 5mL of LB Broth, 5µL of ampicillin and 3µL of chloramphenicol
Add your purified proteins in multiple tubes with different amounts of proteins; for construct we added the following: 20µg, 15µg, 10µg, 5µg, 1µg, 0.1µg and 0.01µg
Incubate the tubes for 1h at 37°C
For the positive control, inoculate a tube that doesn’t have protein on it with a colony of  your bacteria resistant to both antibiotics
Add colonies of your bacteria resistant to chloramphenicol but not ampicillin to the other tubes
Grow the cells overnight
