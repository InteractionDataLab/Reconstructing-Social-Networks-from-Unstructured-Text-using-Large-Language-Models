Bacterial Transformation
Reagents and Materials
Chemically competent E. coli
DNA (e.g., ligation reaction)
SOC medium
LB agar plates + desired antibiotic
Protocol
Thaw 100μL of competent cells (per transformation) on ice just before they are needed
Add DNA (max 20μl) thawed cells and mix by flicking the side of the tube. Leave on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock 5 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius
Place on ice for 5 minutes
Add 250μl SOC medium to each tube
Incubate for 30 to 60 minutes with shaking at 37 degrees Celsius (note that for Kanamycin containing plasmids always use one hour)
Spin down to remove all supernatant except approximately 100 μL
Plate approximately 50 μL on antibiotic plates
Grow overnight at 37 degrees Celsius
