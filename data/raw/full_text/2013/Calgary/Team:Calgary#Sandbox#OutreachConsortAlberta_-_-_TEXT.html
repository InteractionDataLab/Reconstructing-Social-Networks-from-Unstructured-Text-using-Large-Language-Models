Starting a New Team
Early on this season, we got to bring our iGEM love and experience to Consort Alberta. Through workshops both in Calgary and Consort, as well as frequent Skype meetings, we helped Consort launch their first ever High school iGEM team. In addition to teaching lab techniques and how to use the registry, we helped team to brainstorm and troubleshoot their project. The team had a great year, even bringing home the award for ‘Best Human Practices Advance’ at the High School Jamboree.
