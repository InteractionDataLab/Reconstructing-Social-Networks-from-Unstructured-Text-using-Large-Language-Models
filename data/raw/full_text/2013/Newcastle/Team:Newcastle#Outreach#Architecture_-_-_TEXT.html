Architecture Workshop
Overview
Over the course of this summer, we are also exploring the relationship between architecture and synthetic biology, an area with a lot of potential future applications. On Friday, 16th of August, we organised a workshop with architecture students and our team.  We held a discussion on topics such as what we believe the possibilities from this relationship are and if it is a good thing. The main aim was to identify and explore ideas and concerns raised by these topics. The students expressed a variety of views, such as concern and excitement.
