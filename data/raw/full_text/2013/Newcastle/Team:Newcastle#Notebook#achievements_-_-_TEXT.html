Achievements & Judging
As part of iGEM, there are a list of requirements that need to be met in order to achieve the Gold Medal Standard. We believe that our team have managed to fulfill the requirements and secure the Gold medal. The list below is the proof of our achievement.
Team registration.
- Our application was accepted on the 6th May.
Complete Judging form.
Team Wiki.
- You've found it!
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
- We are attending the European Jamboree on the 11-13th October.
Document new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project.
- BBa_K1185000.
- BBa_K1185001.
- BBa_K1185002.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
- Rod to L-form switch BioBrick.
- HBsu-sfGFP Fusion BioBrick.
- HBsu-RFP Fusion BioBrick.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
- BBa_K1185000.
- BBa_K1185001.
- BBa_K1185002.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
- BBa_K1185000.
- BBa_K1185001.
- BBa_K1185002.
Describe implications that have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
- We researched the safety of our laboratory work and had two weeks of laboratory training.
- We considered the pros and cons of synthetic biology.
- We reflected on the ethics of our project including the possibility of our bacteria escaping into the environment.
- We looked into the laws governing synthetic biology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms.
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device.
- We have characterized Part:BBa_K818000.
- We have created a new iGEM registry page for this improved part: BBa_K1185004.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
- Gave parameters to team Edinburgh for their modelling.
- Introduced team Leeds to BioNetGen, in our modelling workshop, which they used to model the Cpx pathway.
- Produced BioNetGen tutorial video for team Manchester as a learning resource for future iGEMers.
- Sent team NRP-UEA-Norwich a soil sample for use in their project and completed their questionaire about our experience of iGEM.
- Completed a questionnaire for team Greensboro-Austin to help improve  BioBrick assembly standards and submission.
Describe a novel approach that your team has used to help you and others consider the implications of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts.
- We speculated about the similarities and differences between Synthetic Biology and Architecture and the implications and outcomes that may come from a relationship between these two fields.
- We researched the safety of our laboratory work and had two weeks of laboratory training.
- We considered the pros and cons of synthetic biology.
- We reflected on the ethics of our project including the possibility of our bacteria escaping into the environment.
- We looked into the laws governing synthetic biology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms.
We won gold medal in Lyon Jamboree!!!
