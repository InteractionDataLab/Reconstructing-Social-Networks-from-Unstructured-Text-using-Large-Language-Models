Newcastle University
Newcastle University is a major research-intensive university located in Newcastle upon Tyne in the north-east of England. It was established as a School of Medicine and Surgery in 1834 and became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne by an Act of Parliament in August 1963. The University has one of the largest EU research portfolios in the UK.
The Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology
The Centre for Bacterial Cell Biology is the world’s first major research centre focused on the molecular and cellular biology of bacterial cells. The Centre, which was founded in 2007, brings together over 20 groups of researchers. Collectively, we address a wide range of fundamental biological problems using the whole gamut of modern analytical methods.
The School of Computing Science
The School of Computing Science, Newcastle University. For those who don't know much about us, we are one of the oldest computer science departments in the UK - in 2008 we celebrated our 50th anniversary. We treat teaching and research with equal importance. We run a wide range of up-to-date undergraduate degree programmes, and advanced taught postgraduate degree programmes, as well as a thriving and active research community supporting MPhil and PhD students from all over the world. Our research groups have high international reputations, and address leading-edge research problems in a wide range of topics.
Newcastle Biomedicine
Newcastle Biomedicine is a world leading collaboration of research scientists, engineers, medical doctors and teaching professionals who deliver undergraduate and postgraduate teaching in medicine, dentistry and health sciences. A recognised national centre of excellence, Newcastle Biomedicine brings together internationally respected research in clinical care, basic science and engineering in an innovative environment. Key areas of focus include ageing, stem cells, cancer, cell biology, genetics, drug development, medicine in society, and neuroscience. Newcastle Biomedicine joins Newcastle University with the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and embraces other academic institutions and NHS hospitals in the North East of England.
Centre for Synthetic Biology and Bioexploitation
The CSBB is based on world-class expertise across all Newcastle University's faculties - Medical Sciences, Science, Agriculture and Engineering and Humanities Arts and Social Sciences.   Newcastle University is one of five UK universities in the Flowers Consortium that is developing a UK infrastructure for Synthetic Biology (funded by the EPSRC). Our centre also leads the UK networks on synthetic biology, SynBioNT and is heavily involved in standards development through the SynBioStandards network. These two UK-funded networks collect hundreds of national and international collaborators and constitute an invaluable pool of expertise.
School of Architecture Planning & Landscape
The School is one of the largest and most dynamic schools of its kind in Europe.   We are one of the few academic schools in the UK focusing exclusively on the built environment.  The broad emphasis of the School is on making and sustaining places which enhance the quality of life for present and future generations. From our analytical work on understanding contemporary places and place-making to our wide-ranging teaching in planning and design, the School forges new approaches to creating exciting synergies between education, practice and policy-making in the promotion of social cohesion, environmental sustainability and economic development.
