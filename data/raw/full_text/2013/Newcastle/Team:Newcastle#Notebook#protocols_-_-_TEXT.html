Protocols
Introduction
Over the course of our iGEM project we used many different laboratory procedures. In this page we have kept a detailed record of our protocols for our own use and so people exploring our wiki can understand how we carried out our experiments and gained our results. Please click on a protocol name on the tab on the right side of the page to view it.
L-form Media Components
2×MSM
Two times concentrated stock of 1 M sucrose, 40 mM Maleic acid, and 40 mM Magnesium Chloride.
342 g Sucrose.
4.65 g Maleic acid.
8.12 g Magnesium chloride hexahydrate.
Add d-H2O to a final volume of 1 litre.
Adjust to pH 7 with NaOH.
Aliquot into 500 ml bottles.
Autoclave on a short cycle (15 minutes at 121°C) as prolonged heating caramelizes the sugar giving a dark brown solution that the bacteria don’t grow in.
2×Nutrient Broth (NB,  Oxoid)
Add 2.6 g of NB to 100 ml of demin-H2O then autoclave.
2×Nutrient Agar (NA, Oxoid)
Add 5.6 g of NA to 100 ml of d-H2O then autoclave.
Stock PenG
200 mg/ml of Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin or PenG, Sigma).
Add 2 g of PenG to 10 ml final volume of d-H2O and filter sterilise.  Aliquot and freeze at -20°C.
L-form Growth Media
Solid Media
First make 2x Nutrient agar (Oxoid, NA), 2x MSM and 200 mg/ml PenG.
Allow the nutrient agar to cool to about 80-90°C.
Add an equal volume of MSM at room temperature.
Mix thoroughly.
Add 200 µl of 200 mg/ml PenG and pour.
Allow the agar to set and cool to room temperature.
Air dry for no more than 5 minutes.
Notes: These last two steps are critical as evaporation of water increases the concentration of sucrose: this should be avoided as L-forms are highly sensitive to changes in the osmolarity of the media.
Liquid media
Mix equal volumes of 2× MSM and 2× Nutrient Broth (Oxoid, NB) and add 200µl of (200 mg/ml) PenG if required.
Add 14-20 ml of media to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask.  Or 8-10 ml into 100 ml flask.
Inoculate the media with 5-10 µl of cells from an L-form colony/liquid broth with a pipette.
Gently mix the media to break up the cells.
Incubate at 30°C without shaking.
Notes: A low media volume to flask volume ratio allows a thin layer of media which helps maximise diffusion of oxygen. Shaking is not necessary for growth, and if done should be very gentle.

Creating L-forms
After transforming your Bacillus subtilis with the switch brick , you will need to plate them out onto LB (1.5% agar) with 5 µg/ml of chloramphenicol (Cm) and 0.5-0.8% xylose.
Method
Pick a colony of rod cell B. subtilis with switch brick transformed into them, and inoculate the 50/50 NB/MSM media.
Another culture should be grown with colonies inoculated into NB/MSM that has been supplemented with 0.5-0.8% xylose + 5 µg/ml Cm to act as control.
In non xylose-supplemented NB/MSM, the rod cells will transition into L-form state. In order to keep this culure pure you need to add PenG 200 µg/ml in addition to Cm.
Notes:  The best way to maintain L-form culture is to plate them out as rod cells into LB (1.5% agar) with 5µg/ml of Chloramphenicol and 0.5-0.8% xylose plates before converting to L-form.
Protoplasting to generate L-forms
This protocol can be followed once the B. subtilis is transformed with the switch brick and plated out onto LB agar + xylose-supplemented plate. By using this protocol, which is similar to protocols for generating protoplasts, it is possible to generate pure L-form colonies in a shorter time-frame then letting cells lose their cell wall naturally.
Method
Take the cells from the xylose-supplemented plate and inoculate into 4ml LB + xylose (0.8%) and incubate at 37°C for 2-3 hours.
Dilute the cells by adding 6ml LB + 0.8% xylose media.
Check optical density (OD, 600 nm) of cells every 1 hour until between 0.3-0.6 (mid exponential stage).
Spin down at ~5,500rpm for 4 minutes and discard supernatant to remove the xylose.
Wash once with LB (10 ml).
Pellet the cells at 4,500rpm for 15 minutes and discard supernatant.
Resuspend pellet with Lysis solution (50/50 NB/MSM (4 ml) + PenG (200 µg/ml) + Lysozyme (4 mg/ml)).
Incubate for 1-1.30 hours at 37°C for the lysozyme to work.
Check samples under a microscope during the incubation period until the overwhelming majority of cells are protoplasts.
Spin down and re-suspend with NB/MSM  (10-15 ml) + chloramphenicol (5 µg/ml) + 200µl of 200 mg/ml PenG.
Incubate at 30°C for at least 2 days.
Regeneration of Rod cells from L-form
Rod regeneratiom can be done either in solid or liquid media. It can be performed using either of the following media: -
Protoplast regeneration media
(2X)DM3.
0.5 M sodium succinate (pH 7.3).
0.5 % Casaminoacids.
0.5 % Yeast extract.
0.5 % Glucose.
Mixed with (2X)MSM in 1:1 ratio .
Xylose is added to 1% final concentration.
L-form growth media
Media for L-form growth (NA/MSM) supplemented with (0.5-0.8%) xylose can also be used.

Streak plate
From glycerol stocks
Glycerol stock must be kept in an ice bucket.
Working close to lit Bunsen burner.
Flame a loop until red hot then dip into glycerol stock in cryo-vial.
Streak plate by: -
Dragging loop across agar 5-10 times.
Flame loop, then dip in agar (away from streak) to cool.
Streak 4 times at a 90° angle from first streak.
Streak again 4 times at 90° from second set of streaks.
Streak again 4 times at 90° from third set of streaks to complete a square on the agar plate.
Finally drag loop in a squiggle motion across the centre of the agar plate.
The streak plate must then be left overnight at 37°C for colonies to grow.
LB agar plates will usually be used unless alternative conditions are required.
From liquid culture
Protocol is similar to that of creating streak plates from glycerol stocks. However, an overnight culture of the strain to be streaked is grown and the loop is dipped into this culture rather than a cryo-vial of the glycerol stock.
Liquid culture
Working close to lit Bunsen burner: -
Liquid cultures can be grown in plastic universal tubes if only a small volume is needed (e.g. 5 ml).
Transfer a colony from a plate of colonies using a flame-sterilised loop into liquid LB media in tube.
Cultures should be made from only one colony.
Leave the plastic universals on rotating plate (aerator) at 37°C overnight.
Glycerol stocks
Making glycerol stocks
NB: Only 50% glycerol solution is necessary for preserving cells by freezing at -80°C.
1 volume of 100% glycerol should be mixed with 1 volume of Mili-Q filtered water (i.e. 1 ml glycerol for 1 ml water).
Vortex the solution briefly to mix.
Filter the solution using a sterile syringe filter, then pipette 500 µl of the 50% glycerol solution into cryo-vials.
Pipette 500 µl of the LB cell culture to be preserved into the cryo-vials.
Mix by inverting the tubes.
Glycerol stocks can then be stored in deep freeze at -80°C.

Chromosomal DNA Extraction
Add 1.75 ml of bacterial cell culture to a 2 ml tube.
Spin tubes at 20,000 x g (max speed of centrifuge may be 16,000 x g, if so spin at this speed) for 5 minutes in centrifuge and then discard the liquid supernatant.
Add 180 µl of enzymatic lysis buffer (36 µl lysozyme and 144 µl buffer) to the tube and vortex for 10-20 seconds.
Incubate at 37°C for 20 minutes.
Add 25 µl proteinase K.
Add 200 µl Buffer AL.
Vortex briefly.
Incubate at 56°C for 5 minutes.
Add 200 µl ethanol to the tube and vortex briefly.
Transfer entire contents (~600 µl) to a spin column in 2 ml collection tube using a pipette.
Centrifuge column at 10,000 x g for 1 minute.
Discard flow-through and replace spin column in a 2 ml collection tube.
Add 500 µl Buffer AW1 to the column and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute.
Discard flow through and replace spin column in a 2 ml collection tube.
Add 500 µl Buffer AW2 to the column and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 3 minutes.
Carefully remove tubes from centrifuge without allowing the flow-through to contact the column (if this happens, spin tube in centrifuge again for 1 minute at 16,000 x g) and transfer column to a 1.5 ml tube.
Add 200 µl Buffer AE to the column and leave to stand at room temperature for 1 minute.
Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute and then discard the column.  Store the DNA in the collection tube at 4°C.
NB: Steps 17 and 18 can be carried out in repeat using smaller volumes of Buffer AE in order to try and increase DNA yield.  Adding 30 µl Buffer AE to the column and leaving to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before centrifuging (and repeating 4-6 times) produces a high DNA yield.
Nanodrop quantification of DNA extracts
Nanodrop procedure: -
Log into computer.
Open Nanodrop 1000.
Click on ‘Nucleic Acids’ button.
Default DNA setting will be DNA-50 – this is correct.
Wipe pedestal and top with tissue paper before starting.
Initialise by adding 3 µl H2O to pedestal as instructed by the program.
Blank with 3 µl elution Buffer (EB) (click ‘Blank’).
Add 3 µl sample and click ‘Measure’.
Wipe pedestal with tissue paper between measurements.
Re-blank with water when finished to clean instrument, dry with tissue and log off.

Set conditions of PCR on PCR machine:
98°C 30 seconds  initial denaturation
98°C 10 seconds  denaturation
x°C         (10-20 seconds) anneal
72°C 30 seconds/kb  extension
72°C 5-10 minutes  final extension
4°C         hold
Store the PCR products at 4°C.
NB: The temperature of x°C at the annealing step differs depending on primers used.
NB: The denaturation, anneal and extension steps are repeated cyclically for 30 cycles.
NB: Procedure for PCR differs between DNA polymerases.  This procedure is for Phusion DNA polymerase.

QIAquick Gel Extraction Protocol
Notes before starting
The yellow colour of Buffer QG indicates a pH <7.5.
Add ethanol (96-100%) to Buffer PE before use (see bottle label for volume).
Isopropanol (100%) and a heating block or water bath at 50°C are required.
All centrifugation steps are carried out at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) in a conventional table-top microcentrifuge.
Method
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in a colourless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl). If the colour of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The colour of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation. For >2% gels, increase incubation time.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the colour of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the colour of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The colour of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2ml collection tube.
QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 µl Buffer P2and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Add 350 µl Buffer N3 and mix immediately by inverting 4-6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in a table top microcentrifuge.
Apply the supernatant to the QIAprep spin column by pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30-60s. Discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30-60s. Discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30-60s.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional min to remove residual  wash buffer.
To elute the DNA, put the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 50 µl Buffer EB to the centre of each QIAprep spin column. Let it stand for 1 min and centrifuge for 1 min.

Inoculating L-forms into Chinese Cabbage
Rinse seeds for 2 minutes in 70% (v/v) ethanol.
Soak seeds for 10 minutes in 20% (v/v) Milton’s sterilising fluid.
Wash seeds thoroughly five times in sterile distilled water and leave in final wash for fifteen minutes.
Place seeds in (9 cm) Petri dishes (20-25 seeds per dish) containing Murashige and Skoog (M and S) basal medium, solidified with 0.8% (w/v) agar no.1 (Oxoid, UK) and incubate at 25°C in the dark until radicals just appear (this should take 21-24hr for Chinese Cabbage).
Use spectrophotometry to produce a bacterial suspension containing approximately 107 CFU ml-1 (OD600: approx. 0.7).
Select seeds with radicals 1-2mm in length and soak in the bacterial suspension (20 seeds per 10 ml) for 3 hours at 25°C, gently shaking the seeds by hand every 30 minutes. Treat some seedlings with 5% (w/v) mannitol instead of  L-forms to act as a control.
Wash seeds ten times in distilled water to lyse any extracellular L-forms.
Replant plants on M and S agar plates.
Incubate seeds in sunlight for between 24 hours and 7 days at 25°C.
The plants are ready to be viewed using microscopy.
