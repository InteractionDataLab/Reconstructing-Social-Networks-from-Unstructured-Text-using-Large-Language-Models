Notebook
The CRISPR, Flavouring, and Caffeine teams spent numerous hours in the lab to produce the results presented throughout the project. We tracked our progress through daily updates in our lab notebooks, which enabled the rest of the team to follow the work being done. This notebook is a compilation of the daily activities, procedure, and updates of these groups. Follow the progress of each group in their notebook or look up the specific protocols they used and learn how to do it yourself by clicking the buttons below!
