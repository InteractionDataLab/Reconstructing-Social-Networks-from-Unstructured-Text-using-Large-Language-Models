Conducting the Survey
After obtaining ethics approval on September 19th, we interviewed 100 individuals at the Telus World of Science in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 25th and 26th. Consistent with our approval and the protocol described in the application, we limited our survey to adults who are of age to consent to our research. Unfortunately this limited the number of approachable survey subject since the majority of the population attending science world consisted of school groups and parents with small children.  The survey questioned which factors individuals considered when purchasing yogurt and whether those considerations would alter depending on the genetically modified nature of the yogurt.
