Developing the Survey
We, the UBC iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) team, invite you to take part in a survey that seeks to examine the general public's yogurt purchasing habits and whether your decision would be altered based on various factors such as taste, therapeutic properties, and genetically modified ingredients. Since our project this year involves genetic modifications that could potentially be used in the one of the bacteria responsible for producing yogurt, we are interested in the results of this survey. If you have any questions, we can be reached at: ubcigem@gmail.com.
By completing the questionnaire, it will be assumed that consent has been given.
If you have any concerns about your treatment or rights as a research subject, you may contact the Research Subject Information Line in the UBC Office of Research Services at 604-822-8598, or if long distance e-mail to RSIL@ors.ubc.ca
Survey
We would like to know your habits on yogurt and your views on genetically modified (GM) foods. GM foods are those that have been modified by genetic manipulation as defined by health Canada.

Genetically Modified yogurt is a yogurt produced from bacteria that has been genetically modified to have different properties than that of the wild type. Would you consider using Genetically Modified yogurt if:
