Dear fellow iGEMers,
As some of you may already know, Vine is a new app that takes 6 second videos and has been trending all around the world for the past month. You take a vine video from your phone and upload it directly to a twitter account (such as VINEiGEM2013). They get REALLY creative!
Seeing as there are roughly 200 teams competing in iGEM this year, we figured it would be an awesome idea to try to compile all the projects and biobricks in as little time as possible. We want to challenge you to describe your project and biobricks in 6 seconds using as many creative tricks, backgrounds and costumes as possible. You only have 6 seconds, so MAKE IT COUNT!!!! We believe this will help iGEM teams to get a glimpse of what is happening around the world and compile a quick way to look through the available parts.
Here are the steps to uploading your vines:
Download Vine app on your smartphone (it is free)
Follow the introduction steps to create your video(s)
When finished, publish it to the twitter account:

Thanks!!
