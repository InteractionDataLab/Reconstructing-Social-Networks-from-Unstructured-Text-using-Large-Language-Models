Colony PCR
Supplies needed:
PCR tubes
BioBrick PCR primers (VF2, VR)
Taq polymerase
10x Reaction Buffer
10mM dNTPs
dH2O
Colonies
Steps:
1. Make master mix of PCR components except the DNA. Keep on ice.
N=number of samples
Add about extra amount worth two samples to account for water control and pipetting error.
(if regular PCR is done use ca.50-200ng template DNA and use Phusion and 10x Phusion buffer instead of Taq) 2. Aliquot 25µL per PCR tube, keep tubes on ice.
Following steps must be done near the flame*
3. Touch toothpick/ pipet tip/ loop tp colony, then index plates, then dip in the PCR tube.
Turn of flame*
4. Run PCR:
Turn machine on
Load samples in machine
Select appropriate temperatures and times
1. 95°C for 10s
2. 94°C for 30s
3. 60°C for 30s
4. 68°C for 1min per kb of expected product (round up)
5. Repeat 2-4 30times
6. 68°C for 20 mins
7. 4°C forever
5. Once finished, remove the PCR tubes from the machine.
6. Verify PCR products agerose gel or store PCR tubes at 4°C or -20°C.
