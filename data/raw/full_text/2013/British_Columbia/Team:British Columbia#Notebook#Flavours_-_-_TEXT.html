Team Cinnamaldehyde & Vanillin
Research Designs and Methods
The goal for cloning is to place each gene in the cinnamaldehyde pathways under a constitutive pTET and arabinose promoter pBAD for future characterization of each part. Our final construct should consist of a single pSB1C3 plasmid with all the genes inserted along with its ribosomal binding site and terminator:
Primers for the PAL/TAL, Ligase, and reductase genes are designed to yield PCR products containing all biobrick cut sites in the correct order: Eco R1, Xba 1, Spe1, and PstI. These PCR products could then be digested for ligation into available plasmids containing promoters (with or without rbs) and terminators.

Experimenter: Joe
Aim: Retransformation of COMT from biobrick registry and plated on LB agar + Amp

Experimenter: Fisal
Aim: Frances and I used the PCR protocol to extract PAL and COMT form the PSB1C3 vector which was miniprepped by Joe. An annealing temperature of 60 degrees and an extension time of 45 seconds seemed appropriate.

August 2nd
Colony PCR of TAL+PSB1C3 plate
Experimenter: Fisal
Aim: Determine if the ligation of TAL to PSB1C3 was successful via Colony PCR.
Results: Since the empty PSB1C3 vector reports white when a gene has been inserted using one of the Ecor1/Xba1 cut sites and one of the Spe1 and Pst1 cutsites, a quick GFP screen demonstrated which colonies have the construct we are looking for. Five white, non-green, colonies were picked for a 50uL cPCR reaction.  None of the colonies were white, thus the ligation failed.

Run ATCCR1PCR for optimization
Experimenter: Fisal
Aim: Optimize PCR for ATTCR1 using an annealing temperature of 61 degrees and 6% DMSO as described earlier.
Results: The PCR was successful with one sting band at 1.2kbp as expected.
Ligate PAL/COMT/ATCCR1 constructs to Terminator/PSB1C3
Experimenter: Fisal
Aim: Ligate the ATCCR1 construct to PSB1C3 vector; ligation should disrupt the GFP protein yielding white colonies. Digested and purified PSB1C3 was acquired from Joe. Both PAL and COMT had been demonstrated through Colony PCR to have been successfully ligated to arabinose Inducible promoters, thus ligation of these constructs to the terminator mentioned above should yield a construct that we can test expression with. A Final ligation of TAL into PSB1C3 would also be attempted.
Results: The Ligations were run at room temperature for 4 hours and were then transformed into Chemically competent cells in accordance with our transformation protocol. In addition to the ligations mentioned above ATCCR1 was also ligated into a PSB1C3 +arabinose promoter vector. As it turns out TAL has two illegal cutsites, pst1 and EcoR1, that was overlooked, some of the digests performed used EcoR1 and Pst1 thus explaining some of the difficulties encountered.

Experimenter: Cam Strachan
Aim: Optimize GCMS experiments (see protocol).
Results: Only small amounts of the monoaromatic compounds are getting out of the cell.
Read a paper that shorter incubations actually increases the yield for this class of compounds. Also, going to try some partial lysis as the background doesnât seem to be much of a problem now.

Experimenter: Cam Strachan
Aim: Optimize GCMS experiments (see protocol).
Results: Seeing a nice signal for cinnamic acid now. Modified protocol and started culture for all our available parts that result in benzoic acid derivative type compounds. I donât think the CoA intermediates are flying on the GCMS. Also, going to set up internal controls for vanillin, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid.

Experimenter: Cam Strachan
Aim: Run  GCMS experiments (see protocol).
Results: Ran about half or our contructs. Can see many of the products, going to set up the rest of our contructs in the same way and start pulling mass spectrums off the machine to match to libraries and confirm the products. Also re-running different controls such as terminator containing plasmids ect.

September 24th
Experimenter: Cam Strachan
Aim: Run  GCMS experiments (see protocol).
Results: Ran the rest of the contructs. Looks like we have examples of biosynthesis for most of the intermediates in cinnamaldehyde and vanillin synthesis. Need to get my hands on an internal control for the caffeine pathway, although some of the compound calls looks promising. Going to analyze all this data and get back to the CRISPR experiments.
