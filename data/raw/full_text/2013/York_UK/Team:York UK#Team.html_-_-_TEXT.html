The Team
The Launch
Location: University of York
Date: January 2013
Initiators: Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo
Population: 60 in the first meeting, 40 in the first brainstorming session, 20 to begin dry lab work in April, 14 to survive to carry on in the lab.
The Idea
Let’s construct an improved Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), powered by engineered E.Coli, which also converts harmful gold ions to shiny (yet tiny) gold nanoparticles!
Godparents: Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrarranalert
Reason: Our MFC would provide a solution to growing sustainable energy needs, extract gold nanoparticles from pharmaceutical waste
Our team
When did we start?
The iGEM Team formed at the University of York started in January 2013.
Were we popular?
An introductory lecture to the concept of the competition was given by enthusiastic students and later team members – Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo.
60! Over 60 students showed up for the first iGEM presentation, after the competition had been advertised widely.
40! From these, about 40 came to the initial brainstorming meeting. Soon after, a couple of workshops were organised. During those workshops there was a further briefing on the details surrounding iGEM. However, the two main points of those were the brainstorming of project ideas and the subscription of new ‘recruits’ for the emerging York team.
20! After choosing two ideas from a list of over 100, about 20 enthusiastic students decided to carry on with the project.
The godparents of our idea
During one of those early sessions the idea of a Microbial Fuel Cell was mentioned by final year students Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrattanalert. Being a complex idea, it initially did not receive as much attention as other more “exciting” ideas like ‘Organic Lemon Grenades’ for example. One other idea– Bacterial Mouthwash– was taken up seriously by several future iGEMers and the forming team was split into two subunits for the first time and a competition of sorts was organised between the ideas. Eventually, the broad application of MFCs and the rather invasive character of Bacterial Mouthwash tilted the scales towards the former.
Who takes care of us?
University of York lecturers Dr. James Chong, Dr. Gavin Thomas and Prof. Maggie Smith were established as team supervisors. Our team benefited a lot from the help of other academics as well, namely Dr. James Edwards.
The joy of reading
It was now April - the long and grueling process of dry lab work and project design had begun! Team members had to read dozens of papers to get up to the level needed for such a complicated concept. We had regular briefing workshops where we would let our supervisors know how much progress we had made. Sponsorship requests were also sent during this time and an article in NOUSE, the University newspaper and website, was released with the aim of intriguing the potential iGEMers of next year.
The Survivors
Fourteen of us carried on to form the first iGEM team ever at the University of York. We are a good mix of biologists and biochemists, spanning from 1st to 4th year of studies, coming from:

Biographies
Supervisors
Dr. James Chong the Lead Supervisor
Dr Chong became our main supervisor this year, just after he returned from a 3 months trip to... Antarctica! During his time on Signy Island, he investigated microbial consumption of climate gases, hoping to understand more on how climate change affects this region of our planet. However, when he is not out in the cold, he likes to conduct research on mechanisms of DNA replication, using methanogenic archaea. He has been in York for 10 years now and, a big fan of iGEM, he was thrilled to bring the competition to the University.
Supervisor Prof. Maggie Smith
Prof Smith came to York last year and, luckily for us, she was keen on getting involved in the life of the Department by joining iGEM! After nine years at the University of Aberdeen, she chose to continue here her research on phages here. Her main interest lies in the adaptations phages go through, when infecting their host, the antibiotic-producing bacteria Streptomyces.
Supervisor Dr. Gavin Thomas
Dr Thomas is a big fan of Escherichia coli, so we were very happy to have him in our team. His research focuses on transport of molecules accross bacterial membranes (for instance, sialic acid), in the hope of understanding the mechanisms used by bacteria for metabolisation or for evading the host immune system. He is also interested in the symbiotic relationships between bacteria and insect hosts. After more than 10 years at York, he was happy to see the competition coming to town.
Supervisor Dr. James Edwards
Dr Edwards was part of our department since his PhD years! This summer, after more than 10 years in York, he decided to move on to University of Plymouth, where he will be a lecturer in Biomedical Sciences. During his time at York, he investigated the mechanisms of respiration of the human pathogen meningococcus.  We were grateful that, before leaving, he found the time to help our team move the project forward!
Advisor Alexandro Rizzo
My name is Alexandro Rizzo and I am a second year biochemist student at York University. I am one of the founder members of this iGEM team, the first of our university, and I did it because I want to get hands on experience with synthetic biology which I think is gonna be a crucial technology in the near future. I am a mature student, which means I am a little bit old, because I did a lot of other stuff before coming to Uni, like import cars from Germany to Spain, work as a lifeguard, write, travel around the world, volunteer in the third world or set up an organic gardening company back home. But now here I am. I love practicing sports, the beach, movies and literature and spend time with my friends.
Team Members
Andra Stefania Necula
Having completed my Molecular Biology course at York this year, I am now about to start a PhD in Immunology at Oxford. I love being involved in educational projects and I am passionate about entrepreneurship, but at the end of the day it's Biology that makes my heart tick.
Evaldas Klumbys
3rd year biochemist. I am detonated by the power of symphonic metal, activated by the intensity of football, charmed by the grace of ice skating, calmed by the soothing voice of my singing guitar and most importantly fascinated by the beauty of sciences all together. Without them, my life would be meaningless. P.S. I am not insane my mother had me tested (by Dr. Sheldon Cooper).
Kobchai Duangrattanalert
Hello earthlings!!! I am he who knows no rest. I'm surrounded by sarcasm, though it hardly touches onto my head. But BE WARNED, don't lay a finger on me or else I shall be thou DOOM BRINGER ... you mortals. *troll face*
Nikola Panayotov
My name is Nikola. I’m a first year Biochemist originally from Bulgaria studying at the University of York. This is my first year in iGEM. I am interested in exploring the vast opportunities offered by Synthetic Biology. I believe that it will definitely be one of the most important scientific areas in the future. I’m also quite interested in Physics and would like to learn more about it. Throughout this year I have been involved both in the wet and the dry lab work – modelling, designing the wiki, making videos and funding. Apart from that I enjoy going out with friends, watching movies and playing volleyball. I am available on nik_panayotov@yahoo.com
Andrew Farthing
I am a first year Biochemistry student originally from Manchester participating in the iGEM competition this year. The wide range of experience the project offers is staggering, from sponsorship to video production to lab work to outreach. I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work with such an intelligent and diverse group of people. Within the competition I am specifically involved in sponsorship, modelling, outreach and quorum sensing, as well as general lab work. Outside of the lab I enjoy hiking, cycling, camping. I have been a member of the scouts from a young age and have completed my Gold DofE and Queen's Scout award. I also pride myself on having walked Coast to Coast for charity last year.
Jonas Kondratavičius
I came from Lithuania to study BSc in Molecular Biology in York last year. I like it in here and I love the birds around the campus although sometimes I feel unexplainable void within myself as there are no pink pelicans in here. My part in the team was cloning, if you have any queries or need some help, contact me at jk798@york.ac.uk.
Ivan Gyulev
My name is Ivan and I just finished my Second Year of studying Genetics at York. I represent Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Language School “Plovdiv” along with my good friend Nik whose biography you can find somewhere lying around. My interests in Biology are varied and numerous. Participating in iGEM and acquiring knowledge in Synthetic Biology has given me yet another perspective on the magnificent science that is the study of life. Among other topics, I am also interested in Evolutionary Developmental Biology. In the future, I wish to explore the intersections of those two disciplines and many more. My interests and hobbies outside the lab include sports like cycling, rowing and weightlifting, and the trademark activity of my hometown – just relaxing.
Ricardo Cañavate del Pino
My name is Ricardo and I am currently studying Biochemistry at the University of York. I am originally from Spain and I am keen on fashion, marketing and botanics. I would like to lead my career into lab research (epidemics, virology and mycorrhiza are my favourite topics at the moment). Feel free to contact me at rcdp501@york.ac.uk
Gintarė Bučaitė
100% Lithuanian. And if that’s isn’t enough, a girl. Reported to have a lot of ideas, yet not enough time to bring them to life. If she fails to become a scientist, she’ll buy a Mad Cat Lady starter kit with 20 kittens and enjoy the life as it is. Before that, Gintare has plans to do something crazy, something breath-taking and something useful. By the way, Biochemistry, currently second year. iGEM duties: Jonas’ lab buddy. Also, had food. Contact: gb706@york.ac.uk
Rebecca Miles
I am just going into my second year studying biology, and would like to go on to do research in developmental biology. I’ve been learning a lot from iGEM; how to work aseptically, how to keep a lab book, and generally how to be more confident in the lab. A lot of the biological concepts which seemed daunting at first now make perfect sense, and I’m sure they will come in handy later in my degree. When not in the lab I can generally be found doing LARP (Live Action Role Play), a hobby in which I and other LARPers dress up in armour and hit each other with foam weapons. It is at least as cool as it sounds. My email address is rcpm501@york.ac.uk
Extended Team
Hannah Johnson
I’m a second year Biochemist all the way from exotic Gloucestershire, born in the saddle I love horses, and am a keen polo player for the University team. I’ve been mostly involved in the article writing for iGEM and some of the brainstorming. The experience has been enriching and inspiring, working with such a dedicated group of Synthetic Biology enthusiasts.
Rudolfs Petrovs
I am a second year Biochemist. In a search for a better education in a more suitable for me direction I came from Latvia to University of York. I am interested in Natural Sciences, Maths and Computer science but my main scientific interest is in process of ageing. I find iGEM idea fascinating and useful for advancing science and biotechnology in paricular
Caroline Pearson
My name is Caroline and I am currently studying biology at York. I am doing a year in industry this year which is great! My aim is to get as much experience out of my time at University as possible. That is why I was so excited to be involved in iGEM it was great fun to be involved in all the brainstorming sessions and discussing all the ideas which finally became refined into the fantastic idea that we went ahead with.
The University of York
York
Fantastic location, medieval city walls and town itself, lots of birds (maybe too many), friendly people, real Hogwarts express – could you ask for anything more awesome?
York is a city with a rich heritage, having been founded over two millennia ago. It was in turn a Roman, Viking and Norman city. The buildings in the city centre still preserve the beautiful Victorian style, particularly on Shambles, which has been chosen the most beautiful street in the world. York also holds the record for the most haunted place on Earth! The National Railway Museum contains a wide collection of trains, including the locomotive of Harry Potter’s Hogwarts Express.
University
1st in the UK and 7th in the world in the Times Higher Education world rankings of universities less than 50 years old.
2nd for Biosciences in the Guardian University Guide 2014 In general, cool place to study (York students’ approved)
Biology Department
Home for York iGEM 2013 team. State-of-art labs, cutting edge technologies, friendly and approachable lecturers – not boasting, just stating the facts.
Anniversaries
Being established in 1963, the uni celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, a great moment for participating in iGEM for the first time.
