    Let’s construct an improved Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), powered by engineered <I>E.Coli</I>, which also converts harmful gold ions to shiny (yet tiny) gold nanoparticles!

</P><H3>Our team</H3><H3>When did we start?</H3><P>
    The iGEM Team formed at the University of York started in January 2013.
</P><H3>Were we popular?</H3><P>
    An introductory lecture to the concept of the competition was given by enthusiastic students and later team members – Andra Necula and Alexandro Rizzo.
</P><P><B>60!</B> Over 60 students showed up for the first iGEM presentation, after the competition had been advertised widely.
</P><P><B>40!</B> From these, about 40 came to the initial brainstorming meeting. Soon after, a couple of workshops were organised. During those workshops there was a further briefing on the details surrounding iGEM. However, the two main points of those were the brainstorming of project ideas and the subscription of new ‘recruits’ for the emerging York team.
</P><P><B>20!</B> After choosing two ideas from a list of over 100, about 20 enthusiastic students decided to carry on with the project. 
</P><H3>The godparents of our idea</H3><P>
    During one of those early sessions the idea of a Microbial Fuel Cell was mentioned by final year students Evaldas Klumbys and Kobchai Duangrattanalert. Being a complex idea, it initially did not receive as much attention as other more “exciting” ideas like ‘Organic Lemon Grenades’ for example. One other idea– Bacterial Mouthwash– was taken up seriously by several future iGEMers and the forming team was split into two subunits for the first time and a competition of sorts was organised between the ideas. Eventually, the broad application of MFCs and the rather invasive character of Bacterial Mouthwash tilted the scales towards the former. 
</P><H3>Who takes care of us?</H3><P>
    University of York lecturers Dr. James Chong, Dr. Gavin Thomas and Prof. Maggie Smith were established as team supervisors. Our team benefited a lot from the help of other academics as well, namely Dr. James Edwards.
 </P><H3>The joy of reading</H3><P>It was now April - the long and grueling process of dry lab work and project design had begun! Team members had to read dozens of papers to get up to the level needed for such a complicated concept. We had regular briefing workshops where we would let our supervisors know how much progress we had made. Sponsorship requests were also sent during this time and an article in NOUSE, the University newspaper and website, was released with the aim of intriguing the potential iGEMers of next year. </P><H3>The Survivors</H3><P>
    Fourteen of us carried on to form the first iGEM team ever at the University of York. We are a good mix of biologists and biochemists, spanning from 1st to 4th year of studies, coming from:

                  Dr Chong became our main supervisor this year, just after he returned from a 3 months trip to... Antarctica! During his time on Signy Island, he investigated microbial consumption of climate gases, hoping to understand more on how climate change affects this region of our planet. However, when he is not out in the cold, he likes to conduct research on mechanisms of DNA replication, using methanogenic archaea. He has been in York for 10 years now and, a big fan of iGEM, he was thrilled to bring the competition to the University.

                  Prof Smith came to York last year and, luckily for us, she was keen on getting involved in the life of the Department by joining iGEM! After nine years at the University of Aberdeen, she chose to continue here her research on phages here. Her main interest lies in the adaptations phages go through, when infecting their host, the antibiotic-producing bacteria Streptomyces. 
                </P></DIV><DIV class="single-biography supervisor"><H3>Supervisor Dr. Gavin Thomas</H3><P class="bio-text">
                  Dr Thomas is a big fan of Escherichia coli, so we were very happy to have him in our team. His research focuses on transport of molecules accross bacterial membranes (for instance, sialic acid), in the hope of understanding the mechanisms used by bacteria for metabolisation or for evading the host immune system. He is also interested in the symbiotic relationships between bacteria and insect hosts. After more than 10 years at York, he was happy to see the competition coming to town.
                </P></DIV><DIV class="single-biography supervisor"><H3>Supervisor Dr. James Edwards</H3><P class="bio-text">
                  Dr Edwards was part of our department since his PhD years! This summer, after more than 10 years in York, he decided to move on to University of Plymouth, where he will be a lecturer in Biomedical Sciences. During his time at York, he investigated the mechanisms of respiration of the human pathogen meningococcus.  We were grateful that, before leaving, he found the time to help our team move the project forward!

                  My name is Alexandro Rizzo and I am a second year biochemist student at York University. I am one of the founder members of this iGEM team, the first of our university, and I did it because I want to get hands on experience with synthetic biology which I think is gonna be a crucial technology in the near future. I am a mature student, which means I am a little bit old, because I did a lot of other stuff before coming to Uni, like import cars from Germany to Spain, work as a lifeguard, write, travel around the world, volunteer in the third world or set up an organic gardening company back home. But now here I am. I love practicing sports, the beach, movies and literature and spend time with my friends.

Within the competition I am specifically involved in sponsorship, modelling, outreach and quorum sensing, as well as general lab work. Outside of the lab I enjoy hiking, cycling, camping. I have been a member of the scouts from a young age and have completed my Gold DofE and Queen's Scout award. I also pride myself on having walked Coast to Coast for charity last year.

I represent Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Language School “Plovdiv” along with my good friend Nik whose biography you can find somewhere lying around. My interests in Biology are varied and numerous. Participating in iGEM and acquiring knowledge in Synthetic Biology has given me yet another perspective on the magnificent science that is the study of life. Among other topics, I am also interested in Evolutionary Developmental Biology. In the future, I wish to explore the intersections of those two disciplines and many more. My interests and hobbies outside the lab include sports like cycling, rowing and weightlifting, and the trademark activity of my hometown – just relaxing.

                  I am just going into my second year studying biology, and would like to go on to do research in developmental biology. I’ve been learning a lot from iGEM; how to work aseptically, how to keep a lab book, and generally how to be more confident in the lab. A lot of the biological concepts which seemed daunting at first now make perfect sense, and I’m sure they will come in handy later in my degree. When not in the lab I can generally be found doing LARP (Live Action Role Play), a hobby in which I and other LARPers dress up in armour and hit each other with foam weapons. It is at least as cool as it sounds. My email address is rcpm501@york.ac.uk

York is a city with a rich heritage, having been founded over two millennia ago. It was in turn a Roman, Viking and Norman city. The buildings in the city centre still preserve the beautiful Victorian style, particularly on Shambles, which has been chosen the most beautiful street in the world. York also holds the record for the most haunted place on Earth! The National Railway Museum contains a wide collection of trains, including the locomotive of Harry Potter’s Hogwarts Express.
