The York Annual Fund grants funding opportunities for departments, colleges, and student clubs and societies, which support innovative projects that improve opportunities for students and help the university to contribute to the life of the wider community. The money is donated by alumni and friends of the University who are keen to invest in enhancing the opportunities and supporting current students. The York Annual Fund had a budget of roughly £50,000 but received applications for over £100,000. They generously gave us £8,000 to get our project up and running and for this we are incredibly grateful.
The Biology Department at the University of York offers a spectrum of modern biology; from ecology to biomedicine. It has the status of one of the UK’s most elite biological sciences departments as measured by its high rankings for both research and teaching. The department is currently ranked 2nd in the Guardian UK University Guide 2014 league table, 3rd in the Times Good University Guide 2013 and 4th in the 2014 Complete University Guide.

(We received money for the payment of our entry fees in iGEM. The Rapid Response Fund gave us £1000 in order to buy materials for our lab and start working.)             The Rapid Response Fund of the University of York grants up to £3,000. They are available in support of small-scale short-term projects, initiatives or purchases to enhance the quality of learning and teaching by addressing a clearly-identified need or issue.

At the forefront of the molecular biology revolution, more than 500,000 customers worldwide are using QIAGEN Sample & Assay Technologies to achieve breakthroughs based on the building blocks of life - DNA, RNA and proteins.
Doctors are diagnosing diseases more precisely and quickly to guide treatment decisions. Scientists are conquering new frontiers in the understanding of life - and translating that knowledge into better medications. And experts are safeguarding the public with molecular technologies fur human identification, veterinary testing and food safety. A new generation of QIAGEN innovation is creating value in the global market with solutions not even imagined a few years ago. QIAGEN gave us kits for Gel Extraction and PCR purification without which our project would not have been successful.

NanoSight’s “Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis” (NTA) technology detects and visualises nanoparticles in liquids down to 10nm. NanoSight are able to offer size distribution, concentration, zeta potential and fluorescence measurements, on a particle-by-particle basis.  This technology is being utilised in the development of drug delivery systems and viral vaccines, and in nanotoxicology. It also gives insight into the kinetics of protein aggregation and has a growing role in biodiagnostics, including the detection and speciation of exosomes and microvesicles. NanoSight has installed 600+ systems worldwide and its technology is validated by 700+ third party papers citing NanoSight results, consolidating NanoSight’s leading position in nanoparticle characterization.
