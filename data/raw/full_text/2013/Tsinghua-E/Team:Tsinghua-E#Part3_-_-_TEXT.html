Part 3: THU-E Bitter Defender Part
This is a plasmid providing selection pressure for the evolution and enrichment of  tryptophan overproduction microorganism phenotype by defending the toxicity of  tetracycline. This selection pressure was based on the tryptophan dependent tetracycline  antiporterexpression which functioned in tetracycline culture condition.It is  achieved by cloning E. Coli tetracycline  antiporter gene (tetA) downstream of  our previously constructed tryptophan biosensor which wascontrolled by tac  promoter in pTrc99A vector. Three different RBS (RBS-ori (RBS upstream of wild  typeE. Coli tryptophanase(tnaA) operon),  RBS-30 (B0030), RBS-32 (B0032)) were placed upstream of tetA gene.
Previously  engineered E. coli with different  tryptophan productivity (trp000, trp007, trp015 with the overall  productivity as 0, 0.07, 0.15g/L, respectively. unpublished data) were used to test the performance  of this part. The tryptophan productivity of each strain wasmeasured, andit was clear that transformation of the  engineered bitter defender parts didn’t significantly influence original  strains’ tryptophan relative productivity according to Figure.3.
We thus tested  these three parts’ performance by measuring the growth rate of these nine  strains (three kinds of strains with different tryptophan productivity carrying  three kinds of selection pressure plasmids. They were named after trp000-30,  trp000-32, trp000-ori, trp007-30, trp007-32, trp007-ori, trp015-30, trp015-32  and trp015-ori, respectively) in different tetracycline concentration. We interestingly  found that strains carrying bitter defender part with RBS B0030 and B0032  showed good tryptophan dependent growth property within the first 15h:
(1) As the  increase of tetracycline, the selection pressure increased and the growth rate  of strains decreased.
(2) With  increased selection pressure, it could be observed that within time window of  15h, in some selection pressure condition (tetracycline concentration) strains  with higher tryptophan productivity showed much higher growth rate, while the growth  of tryptophan non producer trp000 nearly inhibited by high concentration of  tetracycline.

Figure.3 Bitter defender part performance was measured by the dependent relation between the  strain growth rate and the intracellular tryptophan productivity in finely  tuned M9YE culture condition.Strains carrying bitter defender part with RBS  B0030 and B0032 were shown respectively.
