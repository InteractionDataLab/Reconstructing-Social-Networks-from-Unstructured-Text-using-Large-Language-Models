4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
1.We use ethidium bromide to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories and it is thought to  act as mutagen because it intercalates double stranded DNA, which indicates that it can be toxic.
2.E.coli may have little effect on human health.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No.E.coli in our lab has nearly no difference with normal innocuous E.coli in nature.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The leakage of high -rate mutation bacteria may cause variety of problem to public and its result might be catastrophic. Unpredictable diseases caused by the bacteria we structured through mutation may lead to disastrous results,though the possibility of this extreme situation is tiny.
5.If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product,
what new risks might arise?(Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what  risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant  to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
The effect of mutation part may be enlarged to get more kinds of goal strains, so more uncertain factors will be added in.The possibility of new type of bacteria’s birth will increase sharply.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks?
(For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis,etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
Yes.All of bacteria that contain mutation part is auxotrophic.One of special genes of them has been knocked out so they can hardly survive in normal environment.In addition,our part of mutation stimulator will be destroyed in high temperature so as to get rid of spreading.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)?
Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
Training of extinguishing and protection,such as the manipulation of fire extinguisher and emergency shower in fire or biohazard.
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.
http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/sbc/202/2010/20101208153448737847778/20101208153448737847778_.html
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group?
If yes, have you discussed your  project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
We have the commitee but the discussion is not necessary because it’s a dally work to check the safety.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines?
If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2005-5/23/content_256.htm
d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
(Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features.
1
e. What is the Risk Group of your chassis organism(s), as you stated in question 1?
If it does not match the BSL rating of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are taking.
