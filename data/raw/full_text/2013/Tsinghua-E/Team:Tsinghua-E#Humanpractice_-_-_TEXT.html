Lecture
A series of Human Practice by Tsinghua-E
2013 Tsinghua-E has explored a innovate series as human practice outreach. Traditional way of delivering a lecture is necessary in building a fundamental knowledge about synthetic biology and IGEM; however, it can hardly leave a deep impression to others, especially to those who have never heard the concept. Thus, we conducted a series of activities to lead ordinary students first to perceive, to try, and then to hear and to know.
