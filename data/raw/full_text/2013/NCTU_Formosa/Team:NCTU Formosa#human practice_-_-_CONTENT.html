After a period of time in conducting experiments, we can actually raise more calluses to test whether or not our device can actually realize the improvements and adjustments we have made to achieve a better result.
</P><P>We succeeded in tissue culture learning and we want to promote our technique, therefore we recruited students in NCTU who wanted to experience how to raise tissue culture with our team. First, we introduced them our E.colightuner, a new system that we could easily get what we want by controlling light and temperature. Second, we talked more about synthetic biology in order to stimulate their interest in iGEM. We hoped that they can join us to be the new iGEMers next year. Eventually, they brought back their fruitful results as souvenirs and left them a great experience.
</P><P>Besides that, we are also working hard on completing our device, by modeling our project. We are able to successfully utilize computers to analyze the data and build up a model so that we can predict the result of our whole system. By using this modeling, our E.colightuner can maximum exert its function and  secrete a suitable concentration of hormones we want.

We held an iGEM conference from August 5th through 8th. We invited teams from Taiwan and China. The conference serves as a warm-up Asia Jamboree, so each team presented their projects and posters. During the conference, all of the iGEMers discussed the projects and the difficulties we have all met in experiments. Q&amp;A sections helped all of us exchange opinions and understand the defects of individual projects. We also prepared a barbecue night and a welcome party, so the conference not only helped us share experienced in our project, but also promoted our friendship.
</P><P>Through the conference, all the iGEMers were inspired and motivated to try new approach and combine synthetic biology into other aspects. Furthermore, we also promote synthetic biology to public through the media, and strengthen the connections between different iGEM teams. Overall, we believed that this conference is a hugely success. Since during the last discussion in conference, all the participants agreed to gather together again in the next year.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Process">Process</SPAN></H4><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="DAY_1">DAY 1</SPAN></H5><P>Our iGEMers picked up the Chinese iGEM teams at the airport and introduced Taiwan to the participants, leading them back to NCTU for check-in.
</P><P>After unloading the luggage, participants gathered at the CPT building, having dinner together. Everyone was very excited about the upcoming welcome party.
</P><P>The welcome party. Two hosts prepared a short drama introducing each team. Everyone was touched by our passion and plunged into the exercise.
</P><P>After the short drama, every team gave their introduction and performed talent shows as well. We were very surprised to find out that everyone is so talented and outstanding. This is a good start.
</P><P>The iGEMer of ZJU-China, Congcong Xing, gave us a splendid Latin dance, and Yankang Huang of NTU_Taiwan performed the Chinese martial art.
</P><P>To show our passion and respect to synthetic biology, we held a game, competing for how fast each contestant could replenish a box of tips. Needless to say, everyone was very good and went CRAZY HIGH! All the iGEMers had a wonderful night.

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Day_2_2">Day 2</SPAN></H4><P>In this camp, many iGEMers were the group of lesson. Therefore, they needed to prepare experiments that can introduce knowledge of molecular biology to senior high students. The lessons of this camp included Transformation, Mini-preparation and DNA electrophoresis. First, we explained the principle and the steps of experiment by Powerpoint clearly. We helped students to operate experiments and prevented them doing something wrong. Quickly, they were familiar with experimental technique by ours assistance. Everyone in these lesson learned well and was interesting to biological aspect.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Day_3_2">Day 3</SPAN></H4><P>On day 3, they observed the result of last day. Then, we taught them how to analyze these result. For example, some plates grew well, but others were blank. Telling to them what happened, we let them know the correct method to do experiments.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Day_4">Day 4</SPAN></H4><P>On day 4 of the camp, we prepared a lecture about synthetic biology. First , we taught them the concept of biobrick. Then, they realized the history of this competition and what iGEMers do.
</P><P>Mr. Lin and Mr. Chen were the introducers of this lecture, using easy way to let students understand basic knowledge of molecular biology and biochemistry.
</P><P>In Q&amp;A part of this lecture, students asked several questions of IGEM , and we thought we inspired their passion to IGEM. So as to let them know more, Mr. Lin introduced ours 2013 project. Although it was hard to them , they still listened it conscientiously.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Day_5">Day 5</SPAN></H4><P>On day 5, we programmed the visit of genomics research center for students. First, the guide of center took us to see the mass spectrometer and introduced its principle. Second, we visited Protein X-ray Diffratometer laboratory. Third, the center allowed us to visit Ultra High Throughput Screening. Finally, they prepared a lecture of more about Researches in the Center. We gained a lot in this trip, thinking this national-level institution great.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Day_6">Day 6</SPAN></H4><P>On the last day of biocamp, the group of lesson had prepared souvenirs for students participated in this camp. The souvenirs was tissue-plants implanted by ourselves. We offered a Q&amp;A time to them and introduced this iGEM team again.

We collected the data and made the diagrams below. We offered these questions to the participants of our iGEM conference and required them to hand back the questionnaire. Through the results, we can roughly find out how much they understand about synthetic biology. Furthermore, we also offered the surveys to public in order to get more information of those who are not iGEMers.
</P><P>The pie chart clearly show that the participant in our survey is consisted of almost half iGEMers and half non iGEMers.</P><P> Compared to the first image, we think that iGEMers must have heard about synthetic biology. So we can know that half of non iGEMers have ever heard of synthetic biology . Meaning that , we have successfully convey the concepts of synthetic biology. Still, we have a lot of progressing space to promote biology related knowledge.</P><P>According to the image, it is prominent that half of the participants knew about synthetic biology from school, and with certain percentages, from popular science books and Internet. We can find out that in spite of schools, public media also plays an important role in spreading synthetic biology. But people from school are a lot more aware of it. With that said, we can spread the concepts of synthetic biology through more different measures in the future . </P><P>From the image, we got that most participants heard about synthetic biology in freshman and sophomore during college career. Surprisingly, no people have heard of it during junior high and fewer during senior high. As a result, we may focus on the younger generation to spread the idea of synthetic biology in the future.</P><P>The pie chart clearly show that almost every participants in the survey do know we are able to regulate multiple gene by synthetic biology techniques. </P><P>Interestingly, there is a great percentage of participants thinks that creatures created by synthetic biology is harmful to human. While only 8% of all participants consider it not dangerous.</P><P>From the image, we can also observe a similar result that over half of the participants think products of synthetic biology is dangerous to human.</P><P>Although the participants think products of synthetic biology is dangerous, they are still willing to use it.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer-wrapper"><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="footer-text"><P>2013 NCTU_Formosa</P><P class="author">Website designed by Calvin Hue.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
