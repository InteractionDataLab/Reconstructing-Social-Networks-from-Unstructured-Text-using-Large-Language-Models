Human Practice
This summer, we hosted a summer camp for high school students to build their interests in synthetic biology. In addition, we held a conference for iGEMers cross-strait to learn from each other and be more prepared for the upcoming competition. With these efforts, we have passed on our enthusiasm of synthetic biology to our peers and raise their interests on the topic.
