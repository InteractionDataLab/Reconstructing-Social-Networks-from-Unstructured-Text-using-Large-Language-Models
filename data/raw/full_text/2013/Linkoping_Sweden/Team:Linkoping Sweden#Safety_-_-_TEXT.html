1Safety forms were approved on September 18, 2013 by Evan Appleton.
1.11. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
1.22. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
1.33. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.44. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?

1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety
public safety
environmental safety
In the project the organism E.coli is being used with a risk group 2.  All the laboratory equipment and chemicals are used under controlled manners. We are following safety procedures Handed to us from the laboratory where we are currently working.  Some group members have undergone a laboration security course dealing with common risk factors. Our modified bacteria never leave the laboratory and our final product, the immunochemical biosensor, does not contain live bacteria, they have been lysed prior to use.  Considering these facts, there is no safety issues regarding researchers, the public or the environment.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
There are no safety issues considering our product. It will be an easy and safe detector of allergens with no risk using it.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is a committee as a part of a cooperation between Linköping University and the County Council (Landsting) of Östergötland.
Biosafety Committee
The committee has set up guidelines for working with living organisms etc. and these procedures are followed by the university and by our team.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Unfortunately, we have not come up with any new suggestions regarding the biosafety engineering and how the biobricks can be made even safer.
