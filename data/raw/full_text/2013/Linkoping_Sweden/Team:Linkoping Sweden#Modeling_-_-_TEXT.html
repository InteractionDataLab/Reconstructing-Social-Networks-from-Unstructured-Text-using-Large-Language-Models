SystemModeler light sensitivity model
This is the model that describes the detection of light output from our designed antibody/antigen complex. The model-program will be incorporated into the physical biosensor to determine the amount of antigen in the sample.
This picture describes how the model will explain the antigen/antibody-complex binding and the light difference. As antibody is added to the sample (T=0 s) containing the unknown amount of HEWL-antigen green light is emitted from luciferase. When the RFP-antigen is added (T=10 s) the decrease in green fluorescence and the increase in red fluorescence will be detectable and the detector will thus give a signal saying if it is HEWL-antigen in the sample or not.
