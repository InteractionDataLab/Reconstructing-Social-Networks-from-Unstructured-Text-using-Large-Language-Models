H.P.
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
  * researcher safety,
  * public safety, or
  * environmental safety?
    For the sake of our team members' health and the safety environment that we provided for cell growth, all of us strictly obey the observer rules and the law.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
  * did you document these issues in the Registry?
  * how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
  * How could other teams learn from your experience?
    This year, our team doesn't make any of the new parts which may raise any safety issues.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
  * If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
  * If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
    No. But all of our group members have already followed the book, named "Collection of Laws, Regulations and Standards of the People's Republic of China on Biosafety".
4、Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
    For what I can tell, more detailed division for safety levels could work its way.
