SUMMER CAMP
During Week 11 of our iGEM schedule, part of our team collaborated with Wisconsin Lutheran College's iGEM team for their synthetic biology summer camp. The summer camp consisted of a morning lecture and an afternoon lab, which nine high school students attended. We helped WLC by guiding the students through the lab experiments. These lab experiments consisted of gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction, plasmid isolation/miniprep, SDS-PAGE, pGLO transformation, DNA isolation, microscopy, and a fetal pig dissection.
