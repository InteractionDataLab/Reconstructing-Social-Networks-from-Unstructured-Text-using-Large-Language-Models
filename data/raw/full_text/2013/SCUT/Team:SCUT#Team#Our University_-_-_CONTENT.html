The university, which has a total area of 294 hectares, is situated in Guangzhou, a southern metropolitan in China. The university has two campuses: The Wushan Campus and Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Campus.</P><P class="text">South China University of Technology (SCUT), formerly known as the South China Institute of Technology, was established in 1952. In 1960, SCUT was awarded ranked among the key universities of China. In 1981, it was authorized by the State Council to confer doctor degrees and master degrees, and was among the first universities in the country to do so. In 1995, it was selected as one of the universities into which China will make significant investment in the 21st century. In 1999, it was rated &quot;excellent&quot; during the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment, and was among the first &quot;Excellent Universities of Undergraduate Education&quot; in the country. In the same year, a national science park was established with the authorization of State Ministry of Technology and State Ministry of Education. In 2000, Graduate School was authorized to be established. In 2001, the new cooperative construction of State Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province was implemented in SCUT and it was listed among the top universities in the country. After 60 years of development, SCUT has become a multidisciplinary university focusing on engineering, combined with science, also promoting well coordinated development of management, economics, humanities and law. 
   With precise knowledge pursuit, the school eminent spirit of comity and factualism has come into being, which help cultivating exclusive technological and management talents that are welcomed to the society. In recent years, the demand of graduate students has exceeded their supply. The employment rate of its undergraduates in 2011 has reached 99.10% and that of its graduates 99.10%. Since its founding, the university has cultivated for the country over 260,000 graduates at all levels. A large number of school fellows have become technological mainstays, distinguished entrepreneurs or leading cadres. 
  Facing the new century, SCUT will take discipline constructions as pre-requisite, regard individual as its roots, consider talent cultivation as its ultimate aim and highlight technological pursuit. SCUT intends to enlarge and extend its scale and realize the coordinated development of its scale, structure, quality and benefit. SCUT accelerates its education reform by gearing the university from multidiscipline-oriented to integration-oriented, from teaching research-oriented to research-oriented, and from partial open form to completely open form, so as to build SCUT into a top-ranking State university and a famous world-class university.

The School owns individual teaching, laboratory building and complete facilities, which create a good environment and development space for discipline construction.
  With the rapid development in recent years, our School has formed a sound high-level personnel training system. Nowadays, there are 1058 full-time students in the School, including 754 undergraduates, 253 graduates and 51 PhDs. Our school has a total of 68 staff members of which 89% of the faculty has PhD degree,. There are 10 professors, 22 associate professors, as well as 1 distinguished professor of 1000plan.
  Our School presently has 3 undergraduate programs including Bioengineering, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering. Our school also offers 6 Master programs as follows, Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Biology Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our school has 6 master degree authorizations for Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Biopharmaceuticals as well as 7doctor degree authorization for Fermentation Engineering, Biochemical Engineering, Microbiology, Biomedical Engineering, Physiology, Genetics, Biochemistry and   Molecular Biology.
  In 2007, a first class discipline The Light Industry Technology and Engineering was formed by our school’s Fermentation along with Sugar Engineering as well as Pulp and Paper Engineering which became a national-level key discipline. In 4th 2010, it gained the authority to launch PhD program of first class discipline. According to the discipline background and the need of further development, we will focus on 4 second-class disciplines: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Physiology and Biophysics as well as Medical Biology. In addition, our school has Post-doctoral mobile station for The Light Industry Technology and Engineering.</P><P class="text">Our school has undertaken many major scientific projects, such as national 973 project or national 863 project, and a lot of national or provincial fund projects. We have won 1 national prize for progress in science and technology and 5 provincial prizes. Now we concentrate on the researches of Bioinformatics and Microbial Functional Genomics, Microbial Resources and Regulation of Microbial Metabolism, Molecular Transformation and Enzyme Engineering, Fermentation Engineering and  Fermentation Equipment, Bio-catalytic Processing Engineering, Bioinformatics, Biomechanics, Medical Information and Equipment, and Biomedicine etc.
  Our school has a Guangdong Province’s famous-brand major Biology Engineering which becomes the distinctive construction point of high education institute. Besides, Enzymatic Engineering is rated as the national course. Our school insists on the education philosophy of “uphold engineering characteristics, strengthen science studies” throughout the undergraduate courses and training future practical talents for engineering biology. We tightly connect the great demands of national and Guangdong economic and society development, continuously push forward the innovation of technology and personnel training pattern. We set up all kinds of innovation classes to provide more valuable learning opportunities to the talent students.</P><P class="text">Since BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute) and our school co-founded a “genomics science” innovation class for two years, there have been a total of 31 co-first authors or byliners publishing 22 high-level papers in top international academic journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;. In order to consolidate the fruits of cooperation and promote further bilateral cooperation in the aspect of personnel training, teacher resources, scientific research, disciplinary platform and internationalization etc, we co-founded SCUT-BGI life science innovation college in April 2010. The Innovation College belongs to jointly conduct the training of undergraduate, graduate and youth teacher.
  By virtue of the construction of high-level university and south campus, our School has invested more than 6 million in building a first-class undergraduate teaching laboratory, and it has become the demonstration center of experimental teaching in Guangdong province. 
In addition, 30 million has been invested in constructing scientific research platform. The most iconic achievement during the construction is the acquirement of Provincial Key Laboratory in Fermentation and Enzyme engineering, and Key Laboratory in Industrial Biotechnology of Guangdong Educational Department. </P><P class="text"> Our school actively engages in foreign exchange. We successively established close cooperation with a number of British and American well-known colleges such as Oxford, United Kingdom Imperial College, State University of New Jersey, Camegie Meilun and we also establishes strategic alliance with famous domestic universities and academic institutes. Besides, we hired 2006 Physiology or Medicine Nobel Prize winner, chair professor of University of Massachusetts medical school department of Molecular Medicine, Professor Craig Mello as our honorary professor. At the same time we hired a number of 1000plan winners as our lecture professors or part-time professors.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
