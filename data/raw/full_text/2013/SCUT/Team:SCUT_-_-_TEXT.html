Overview
IGEM everywhere
Oscillating odorant contains two parts: the Producer and the Oscillator. We choose diacetyl as our desire odorant which widely used as a food additive to emit buttery flavor. In order to enhance the production, we construct the E.coli as the producer . Additionally, we add the oscillation system on the basis of odorant producing system, together, distributing a special volatile—diacetyl periodically.
Receptor aims to transplant a nose for S.cerevisiae to achieve the communication between eukaryotes and prokaryotes through odorant. We select a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) from C.elegans, odr-10, as our nose to detect the volatile, diacetyl, generated by E.coli. In order to improve the efficiency of the olfactory receptor, we would modify the downstream pathway  by expressing chimeric Gpa1 and knock out the Far1 gene.
The creation of our odorant producer and sensor presented us with interesting questions: Is the system feasible? And how fast would the sensing response be? Instead of costing too much time in the lab, we turned to modeling to give us an answer. We have built a kinetic model for our systems, diacetyl producer, oscillation and odr-10 pathway, to give us an estimate to observe a result.
