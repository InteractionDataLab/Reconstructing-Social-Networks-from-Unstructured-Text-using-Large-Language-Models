Our Goals
Nevada is known for its gambling and mining industries; however, many citizens of this state feel that our population has the potential for so much more. The 2013 Nevada iGEM team has put forth considerable effort to demonstrate to the people of this state and surrounding regions that the students of the University of Nevada, Reno have the ability to compete side-by-side with some of the strongest intellectual institutions in the nation. In doing so, we hope to engage our citizens with the “Obama effect”, essentially demonstrating that homegrown Nevada students, who come from all walks of life, can come together to be trained in research at a level comparative to that of the nation and the world.
The goal of our human practice projects this year is two-fold:
Use iGEM as a venue to inspire our Nevada citizens and encourage future generations to support intellectual growth in the state.
Let people outside our state know what Nevada iGEM and the students of this state have to offer.
Through the following efforts, we hope to make an impact on how our state and citizens are perceived and how they perceive themselves. We are indebted to iGEM for providing us with a venue to do this.
