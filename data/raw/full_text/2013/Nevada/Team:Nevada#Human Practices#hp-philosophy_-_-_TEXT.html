Making a Name for Ourselves
Our team is surprised every year by how few people in our city know about iGEM, but also by how positively they respond to the idea once they find out. This year, Nevada iGEM has made considerable efforts to establish our team as a hardworking group of students who can proudly represent their university and their community.
Change Starts from Within
This year we changed the name of the iGEM research lab to The 10,000 Hour Lab based on Malcolm Gladwell’s book Outliers and the research of Anders Ericsson. Dr. Ericsson’s work demonstrated that it takes more than talent to be successful. The most important component is hard work and deliberate practice in your field of interest.  This is how the iGEM team sees itself and promotes itself. By committing to this philosophy, we hope to be role models for success of our community and beyond.
Establishing iGEM at the University of Nevada
In an effort to promote our new philosophy, Nevada iGEM reached out to our university’s Provost for support and recognition so that the University of Nevada may continue to have an iGEM team for years to come. A man of science himself, the Provost was impressed with our efforts and sympathetic to our financial concerns. In addition to generously seeking additional funding for iGEM, he has invited us to speak in November at the University President’s tailgate party where we will be able to speak with many influential people throughout from all over the Nevada about iGEM and our goals.
