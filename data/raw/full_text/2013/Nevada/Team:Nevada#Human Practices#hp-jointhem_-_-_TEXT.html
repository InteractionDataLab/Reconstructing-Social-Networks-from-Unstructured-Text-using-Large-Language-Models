While it was important to our team to show the outside world a side of Reno, Nevada beyond neon lights and slot machines, we also think that side of our city can be a lot of fun! A big part of involving ourselves with our community was embracing Nevada's strengths, which led to more phone calls to local business than any of us have ever made, and a great fundraising event we hope we can organize every year.
iGEM Poker Night
Our team has to raise most of its travel money. What better way to promote the Nevada iGEM Team then to have an iGEM-sponsored poker tournament?  The event was promoted through Facebook, the university alumni association, and local press releases that described the goals of iGEM and the team. Over 50 people attended and were given free beer, wine, and food donated by the Club CalNeva, generous Renoites, and local businesses. The tournament goers were an incredibly diverse crowd that included students, faculty, friends, family, strangers, and potential donors, who all came together  over a mutual love of poker, science, or both! The crowd walked away knowing about iGEM and our dedication to hard work. They also know now that “nerds” know how to have a good time too!  From this effort we were able to raise $2000.

Help from Local Businesses
An important part of the poker event was the door prizes donated by local businesses. We went door-to-door discussing iGEM and handing out fliers explaining what we do each year for the competition. Over $2000 dollars in door prizes were donated to this event from various restaurants, small business, gyms, and yes, more casinoes. Also, trophies for first, second, and third place were donated by our local trophy shop. This was a great way to interact with the business community while helping us fundraise.
