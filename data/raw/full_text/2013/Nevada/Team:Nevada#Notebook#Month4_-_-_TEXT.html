August 5th – August 11th
Monday
Christian and Jasmine started Top 10 Cultures for first assay.
Jon transformed LMG194 with pBAD vector containing INPN-YFP
Tuesday
Christian and Jasmine did the first lysozyme only assay.
Wednesday
Becca, Christian, and Jasmine started a culture for TOP10 cells to be used in second assay. They also purified Lyz103 and KZ144 endolysin.
Jon induced LMG194 and BL21 cells containing cell surface fluorescent markers
Thursday
Christian and Jasmine ran the Xanthomonas endolysin assay using 30 ul of purified endolysin.
Jon noted fluorescence in BL21 cells but not LMG194
Friday
Christian and Jasmine checked assay 2 results and plated contents from E11, E12, F11, and F12.
Christian, Jasmine, and Dafne completed project description.
Jon began growing large culture of Plac-INPN-YFP containing BL21 cells for assay
August 12th – August 18th
Monday
Christian grew RFP containing bacteria cells to be used in an assay.
Tuesday

The team had the Poker Night fundraiser
August 19th – August 25th
Monday
Christian did a transformation n for Cody’s submission plasmid. He also started a small culture of TOP 10 cells for assay.
Tuesday
Christian performed the assay on the top 10 cells and used protease inhibitor this time. Christian also did a transformation for Jon’s part.
