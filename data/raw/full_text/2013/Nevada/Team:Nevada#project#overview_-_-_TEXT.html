Lysesavers is a product that couples a biosafe surfactant that can permeabilize the outer membrane of bacterial cells with naturally occurring endolysin proteins that degrade the peptidoglycan of gram-negative bacterial pathogens. This leads to the specific and environmentally safe lysis of bacteria which cause plant diseases.
