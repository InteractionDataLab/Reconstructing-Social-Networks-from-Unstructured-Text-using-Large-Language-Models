The idea is to take the green fluorescent protein genes and split it into two subunits (the N and C terminus), that when close enough would interact to produce GFP. This would be useful in any situation where two subunits must be close enough to interact and to determine how much interaction was needed. For this part, we began by sequencing the parts to see what might have gone wrong. One part was not BioBrick formatted and contained in EcoRI restriction site in the middle of the sequencing. Also, both needed an ATG start codon for the sequence to work. Then, the parts had to be assembled with a promoter, operator, and RBS.
We used standard assembly to assemble the RBS part BBa_B0034 onto the each GFP part. We found that 3A assembly did not work for small parts such as the strong ribosomal binding site, so we had to use the standard assembly instead. Simultaneously, we assembled the strong T7 promoter (BBa_I719005) with a LacI, IPTG induced operator (BBa_R0010) using 3A assembly. After, we worked with 3A assembly to combine the T7+LacI+RBS+N-Terminus Split GFP+C-Terminus Split GFP.

</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</SPAN></H2><P>The 2012 GT iGEM team created a BioBrick that would allow for two parts of the green fluorescent protein to interact and allow the E. coli to fluoresce. This part needs to be assembled with T7 promoter region and a lacI operator as well as a RBS.

It is weird that the parts cut with one restriction enzyme have three bands. I have no idea why.

</P><P>It should be noted that although the ladder was not the most clear, the backbones all lined up as they should (They are all around the same length) and the parts are around their respective lengths.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_9.2C_2013">July 9, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>Ligation was performed, using a modified version of the 3A ligation procedure. The vectors and the parts were added at a 1:4 ratio, as that is the ratio of their relative lengths. the vector was added with 50 ng, and the part was added at 100 ng. The amount of DNA ligase and reaction buffer changed as the reaction became a 30 uL reaction, as opposed to a 20 uL reaction. 3 uL of buffer and 1.5 uL of Ligase was added instead of the usual amounts, and water filled the tube to be 30 uL.
</P><P>XL Blue were transformed, since XL10 gold has been shown to be contaminated with ampicillin. The plates will be checked tomorrow for growth.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_16.2C_2013">July 16, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>With a large amount of growth on the plates, it appears as if the assembly worked. A colony PCR was performed and it showed promising results for four of the clones. These clones have been made into media solutions and will be sent off for sequencing.

</P><P>A standard assembly was performed with the other split GFP part using Spencer Standard Assembly Protocol and is awaiting a gel to confirm the purification of the gel extraction. This was performed with the same modification of the steps, including using all of the DNA from a single clone in the restriction digest to attain the largest amount of concentration on the gel to extract.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_19.2C_2013">July 19, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>The sequencing result came back from Macrogen today, and the assembly was a success! It was proven to work with split GFP part 1D2, BBa_K916003.
</P><P>Work has began on combining the other part, 1B1, BBa_K916004.
</P><P>Also began the 3A Assembly of T7+LacI with the new RBS+1D2. However there was a mistake using ampicillin backbone when the chloromphenicol should have been used instead
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_22.2C_2013">July 22, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>Colony PCR of the products were ran.
</P><P>The colony PCR also came out strange. Possibly the gels made this morning were not the best batch. 1B1 clones 1 and 3 were made into media solutions. It appears there was a slight contamination around the 1kb mark so any faint marks at this level were disregarded as contaminants. None of the 3A Assembled products appear to be the right size (800 bp). This is most likely to do with my mistake in the 3A assembly. I should've used a chloromphenicol backbone for the proper 3A Assembly. Clone 1 appears to be the most promising and will be made into a media solution.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_1st.2C_2013">August 1st, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>Sequencing came back for the assembled T7, LacI, RBS, and 1D2, which shows nothing. Another 3A Assembly will be attempted today  for both 1D2 and 1B1.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_7th.2C_2013">August 7th, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>After suffering some setbacks, including no gels to run DNA, it was determined that the chloramphenicol backbone may be incorrect. All tried assemblies onto this backbone have been unsuccessful.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September_13.2C_2013">September 13, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>3A Assembly of full operating GFP part. Colonies grew, however the colony PCR did not show the most promising bands. Will send for sequencing.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September_18.2C_2013">September 18, 2013</SPAN></H3><P>Sequencing results do not look promising. Still a lot of problems with our current chloramphenicol backbone. Must do testing to determine why the parts are not assembling well in the 3A Assembly. Maybe we should revert back to standard assembly.
