Team:GeorgiaTech/Agar Plates and Media Protocol
From 2013.igem.org
Add (35 g/L of LB Agar ) or (25 g/L LB broth and 15 g/L Agar ) to a flask with distilled water
Dissolve and autoclave for 1 hour on fluid cycle
Antibiotics should be added at the correct concentration and volume when the agar has cooled to around 50°C or cool enough for hands to be touching the exterior of the flask.
Concentrations of antibiotics:
Chloramphenicol 34 µg/µL - Blue
Kanamycin 50 µg/µL - Green
Ampicillin 100 µg/µL - Red
For every mL of LB agar solution, add 1 µL of antibiotics.
Since I was using 300 mL of water, I added .3 mL of kanamycin
The plates are poured and cooled, then marked with a marker to signify the antibiotic.
Agar stabs are from the same protocol, just poured into tubes and capped.
Media solution is made from LB broth (25 g/L), autoclaved, and antibiotics added to it.
From the toothpick used to create an agar stab, the toothpick is placed into the media solution to start the culture.
