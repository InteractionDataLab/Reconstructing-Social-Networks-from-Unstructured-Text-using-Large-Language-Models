Team:GeorgiaTech/Gel Electrophoresis Protocol
From 2013.igem.org
Procedure
Get a agarose gel from the refrigerator and place in apparatus, making sure it is completely covered in TAE buffer.
Calculate the amount of purified plasmid that needs to be added to each lane.
The goal is to add ~100ng of DNA to each well.
The typical ladders used are 1k bp from NEB (only 2uL is used)
In a PCR tube mix:
desired amount (100ng) of DNA
2uL of 6x dye
2 uL of Buffer2
3 uL of water
0.5 uL of each restriction enzyme
Load 8uL into each lane on the gel . Run the gel for 30min at default settings
Look at the gel under blue lamp and take a picture
Discard the gel and clean up
