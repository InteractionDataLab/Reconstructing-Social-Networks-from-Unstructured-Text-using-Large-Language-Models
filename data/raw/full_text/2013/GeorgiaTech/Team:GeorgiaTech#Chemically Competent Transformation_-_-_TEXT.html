3Heat Shock protocol for PCR machine
3.1Estimated Time: 1 hr 11 mins
Materials
Chemically Competent Cells -20 µL
PCR machine
10% BME ( beta mercaptoethanol ) - 0.88 µL
SOC media - 222 µL
Pipette tips with cut ends ( To decrease the amount of cells destroyed during the transferring and resuspending procedure)
Plates with appropriate antibiotic (if stored in fridge, place in incubator before doing the transformation so that the plates are warm when it's time to plate)
Procedure
Transfer 20 µL chemically competent cells from -80°C freezer to a PCR tube using a cut pipette tip
Thaw competent cells over ice --> They should NOT be taken from above 4°C freezers)
Thaw 10% BME - 0.88 µL (Must be completely thawed)
Add 10% BME to the PCR tube with the competent cells
Incubate on ice for 10 min
Add 2 µL of purified plasmid
Incubate the PCR tube in the PCR machine with HEATSHOK program:
Heat Shock protocol for PCR machine
4°C for 10 min
42°C for 30 sec
Hold at 4°C until we add 222 µL of SOC
37°C for 1hr
Holds at 4°C until we are ready for the next step.
Estimated Time: 1 hr 11 mins
Be sure to sterilize the bottle with EtOH, and not contaminate the media when loading it into the heat cycler
Plate 20 µL and 200 µL from each tube using the spreaders on LB /agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic
Leave plates at 37°C overnight.
