Colony PCR Protocol
Materials
Prepare master mix: (Total volume 50 µL)
5X Rxn Buffer 10 µL
Oligo 1 (5µM) 7.5 µL
Oligo 2 (5µM) 7.5 µL
dNTP mix 1 µL
DMSO 1 µL
ddH2O 22 µL
Phusion 0.5 µL
NOTE: you will need 10µl of the master mix per colony, plus for positive and negative controls. Adjust volumes appropriately.
Oligos 1 and 2 are the primers for the BioBrick part, VF2 and VR. Make sure to dilute the concentration to 5 µM to prepare the appropriate amounts.
To prepare the cells
If you have a liquid culture:
Prepare as many PCR tubes as you have cultures you want to amplify. Add 100 µL of ddH2O to each of those PCR tubes.
Take 3 µL from each culture you want to PCR amplify and add to the PCR tubes (make sure to properly label each tube).
If you have plated colonies:
Prepare a sterile environment (wipe down counter with ethanol , get out a bunsen burner and light with a striker).
Sterilize metal innoculating loop with bunsen burner and scoop up one colony and mix into the appropriate PCR tube.
Procedure
Prepare connected PCR tubes (one for each colony, one for positive control, and one for negative control)
Add 10 µL master mix into each tube
Immediately cap the negative control to prevent cross-contamination.
Add 1 µL of diluted cell culture to its corresponding PCR tube (make sure to label everything)
Use a positive control that you know will work and has a known part
Close all caps and place in PCR Machine
Run PCR program COLONPCR_Protocol
Once this is complete, you will be able to analyze these colonies using gel electrophoresis and determine which colonies have the appropriate parts.
