Week 3: 1st July - 7th July
Tuesday, July 2nd
We prepared the BL21 and BG1655 strains to be competent.
Wednesday, July 3rd
The two strains have been contaminated  and are not usable.
Thursday, July 4th
Genomic DNA extraction of the BL21 and BG1655 strains have been done using two different methods.  We received the primers we have ordered. They have been prepared to do a PCR. In order to get our genes of interest we did a PCR using as the DNA template the genomic DNA extracted from BL21 and BG1655.
Friday, July 5th
To ensure the amplification of our genes by PCR, we did a agarose gel electrophoresis. To do so, we first prepared a TAE 50X stock solution. By diluting it, we use a 1X TAE solution to do a 1% agarose gel. We obtain the following gel. That showed that only two of our genes have been amplificated by PCR. A new PCR will be made.
