Microfluidic experiment
30/09/13
Chip's channel were full of bacteria, even after 2 hours of washing (with free iron M9) because we let the bacteria growth over the week-end (in LB medium). Hence, we prepared another chip to launch another experiment on the next morning.
As our bacteria have a plasmid AceB-sfGFP and there is no iron in our M9, we still check if bacteria expressed sfGFP protein.
The first results appear promising, but we need to confirm them with a proper experiment.
Figure 1: Escherichia coli (TOP 10 strain) expressing sfGFP.
At the top of the picture, we can see that the channel is full of bacteria.
02/10/13
Our first results show that our bacteria grow well and look healthy in both M9 medium with high or low concentration of iron. Those results confirm our previous result of TECAN. However, the acquisition is not suitable for proper and further analysis. We could design a new mould for microfluidic chip that would be more suitable for our experiment.
