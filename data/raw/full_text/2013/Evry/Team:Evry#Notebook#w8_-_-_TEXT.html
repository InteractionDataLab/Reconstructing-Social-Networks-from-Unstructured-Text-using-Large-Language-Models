Plasmid 3:
05/08/13 We started the week by doing the golden gates over again, meaning the GG 3 and GG 2 (2.1 with FurBS 1, 2.2 with FurBS2 and 2.3 with FurBS3). In fact, our previous control positive had some unwanted white spots (01/08/13), thus suggesting some contaminations during the transformation step. curretnmy waiting
06/08/13 We performed 6 golden gates, 3 for the second construction, 2 for the third construction and one for the controle plasmid. We prepared a mix for the 6+1 tubes :
7x 1,27 = 8,89 µl of 1A3 plasmide
7x 1,74 = 12,18 µL of terminator
7x 1,5 = 10,5 µL of T4 Buffer
7 x 0,5 = 3,5 µL of BSA
7 x 0,5 = 3,5 µL of T4 ligase
We then added:
Tube 1. =
0,76 µl of Andersen's promoter
0,76 µL of RBS
0,76 µl OF Fur BS
2,93 µL of sfGFP
Tube 2. =
0,76 µl of Andersen's promoter
0,76 µL of RBS
0,76 µl OF Fur BS
2,93 µL of sfGFP
Tube 3. =
0,76 µl of Andersen's promoter
0,76 µL of RBS
0,76 µl OF Fur BS
2,93 µL of sfGFP
4,28 µL of water
Tube 4. =
1,25 µl of pLac O
µL of RBS-sfGFP
3,4 µL of water
Tube 5. =
1,25 µl of pLac O
2,05 µl of EntA
3,37 µL of EntD
2,07 µl of EntF
0,5 µL of water
Tube 6. = Controle Plasmid
0,76 µl of Andersen's promoter
0,76 µL of RBS
2,93 µl of sfGFP
4,28 µL of water
On the afternoon, we launch another golden gate for EntB/C/E  Tube 7. =
1,27 µl of plasmid 1A3
1,5 µL of pLacO
0,49 µl of EntB
0,65 µL of EntC
1,74 µl of terminator
1,5 µL of Buffer T4 ligase
0,5 µl of T4 ligase
0,5 µL of Bsa 1
5,88 µL of water
Additionnally, we did the optimization of our PCR over with the temperature gradient for the annealing step. current waiting
09/08 We make 38 tube of Top 10
