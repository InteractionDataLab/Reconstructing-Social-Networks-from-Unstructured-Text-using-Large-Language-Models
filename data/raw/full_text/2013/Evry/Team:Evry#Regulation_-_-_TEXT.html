Regulation of Human Iron Uptake :
Negative Autoregulation:
This regulation is ruled by the liver. The liver "watch" the iron rate in the blood. When this rate is too high, the liver produce hepcidine. Hepcidine stop the iron uptake. So, we can say that's is a negative autoregulation. Therefore we assume the regulation as a negative feedback equation :
