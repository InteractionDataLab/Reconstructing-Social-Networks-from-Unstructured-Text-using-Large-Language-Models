Collaborations
We participate to the online survey of UGent team about Synthetic Biology and to Purdue iGEM Characterization project !
We met with the Paris Saclay team at iSSB on 19 August to discuss our respective projects.
During this workshop, each team presented the different aspect of their project: from biology to modeling, and ethics. We then debated on each other project and each team proposed various way to improve the other team's project.
Congratulations for your gold medal at the Lyon Jamboree!
