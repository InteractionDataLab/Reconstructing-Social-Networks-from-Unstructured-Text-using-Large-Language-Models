Healthy person model
Overview
The duodenum is the first part of the intestines. It is located right after the stomach, and is usually 300mm long.
This model simulates the behaviour of a hemochromatosis suffering person's duodenum. We use it to compute the quantity of iron absorbed by the organism.
Assumptions
Constant iron flow
Homogeneous fluid
The patient ingests 20mg of iron per day (Guideline Daily Amounts)
Model Description
Figure 1 : Iron in the middle and absorbed in the duodenum of a Healthy person.
Figure 2 : Iron in the middle and absorbed in the duodenum of a sick person.
