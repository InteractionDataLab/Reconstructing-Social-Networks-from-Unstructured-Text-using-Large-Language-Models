An alternative iron chelator
At the Regional Jamboree, we discussed with Edinburgh team which also work on iron chelation but with another chelator: the ferric ion-binding protein A (FbpA).
This protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae is able to chelate various ion in solution as Fe
3+
, Ti
4+
,Cu
2+
, Zr
4+
(Zirconium ion)  or Hf
4+
(Hafnium ion). Its affinity for ferrous iron is 10
18
, less than our enterobactins system, but it remains a good alternative for our treatment.
