Since European Jamboree!
We worked hard since the last european Jamboree, taking into account the remarks from the juges and continuing on our own ideas. Here are the our main acheivements:
Biology:
Proceed to new inverter constructions
Cloned an periplasm located iron chelating protein coming from Nesseria
Modeling:
We parametrized all our models with the experimental parameters of the iron sensor
We created a cellular automaton based model of the treatment in the upper intestine
Human Practice:
We estimated the cost of the capsule, the benefits for the company producing it and the gain of the French national care system
We consulted SANOFI, a world leader drug maker
Biology:
We improved the characterization of our best iron sensor
Modeling:
We reviewed the math, the code and improved the description of all our models for further re-use in iGEM
Human Practice:
We extended our survey of patient to the rest of the world
Wiki:
We made a simplified french version of our Wiki that could be accessible for french patients
We survived a second Wiki-freeze but without coffee this time !!
Here we detail how we fulfilled each of the iGEM medal requirements .
Gold Medal (requires any one of the following goals)
We improved the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device. First, we re-characterize the LacO-RFP BioBrick BBa_J04450 ( Biology Results Section ) and improve it by integrating it with an aceB-LacI iron sensor ( Biobrick BBa_K1163102 ). Together, these Biobricks create a Fur Inverter (see Biology Results Section ) that activates gene expression in response to iron.
We collaborated with other iGEM teams: we participated to Purdue and UGent online survey and had a nice workshop with Paris-Saclay team. We are also setting up a scientific collaboration with the Edimburgh iGEM team that is working on and environmental sensor using the Fur System.
As our project involves treating a human genetic disorder using genetically-engineered bacteria, it has numerous implications for human health, safety and security, and ethics. To enable safe delivery of therapeutic bacteria to the human intestine, we designed and constructed a polymer-based capsule . We also explored safety and ethics consequences of our project as the Human Practices studies:
We discussed the medical feasibility and implications of this treatment in a series of interviews and discussions with renowned experts on iron overload diseases.
We carefully analyzed the safety issues and potential consequences of our bacteria using consequence-based decision tree.
We organized and hosted a scientific conference on iron overload disorders and perceptions of our our project on 18 September 2013. This conference was attended by both medical experts and iron disorder patients.
We prepared and disseminated a patient perception survey about how our treatment could potentially help hemochromatosis patients. We received and analyzed the results from over 250 patients who responded to our survey.
We wrote an extensive report on our conclusions about  synthetic biology , which is the fruit of our many discussions over the summer.
Silver Medal (requires each of the four following goals)
We experimentally validated that the aceB-sfGFP biobrick acts as an iron-reponsive biosensor ( see Biology Results Section ).
We document the characterization of our aceB-sfGFP and other BioBricks in "Main Page" section of the Parts Registry.
We submitted the following BioBricks parts to the iGEM Parts Registry. The 4 sfGFP constructs function as iron sensors and the lacI constructs are used to build a Fur-based genetic inverter that activates gene expression in response to iron. These 8 Biobricks have been received and accepted by the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
BBa_K1163102 : AceB-sfGFP
BBa_K1163103 : AceB-lacI
BBa_K1163105 : FepA-sfGFP
BBa_K1163106 : FepA-lacI
BBa_K1163108 : Fes-sfGFP
BBa_K1163109 : Fes-lacI
BBa_K1163111 : YncE-sfGFP
BBa_K1163112 : YncE-LacI
We describe how our project has implications for safety and ethics
Bronze Medal (requires each of the five following goals)
We registered our team for iGEM 2013 and are attending the European Regional Jamboree.
We completed and submitted the Judging form .
We made a comprehensive and accessible iGEM Evry 2013 Wiki to convey our educational and scientific advances.
We will present a poster and give an oral presentation at the iGEM European Jamboree in Lyon, France.
We document 22 BioBricks used in our project and submit 8 news BioBricks to the Parts Registry (see 8 submitted Biobricks in Silver Medal Requirements).
