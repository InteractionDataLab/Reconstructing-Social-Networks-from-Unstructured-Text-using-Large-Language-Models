Team:Evry/test/Modeling
From 2013.igem.org
Modeling overview
The modeling part is planned around 4 main targets:
Growth of an iron-chelating bacterial population
Risk assessment : forecast, control, auto-regulation, ...
Bacterial activity : iron-chelation rate, avidity (cellular scale)
Intestine mapping and interactions
First approach
For a better understanding of the bacteria our team is going to produce, we chose to first focus on the growth of an iron-chelating bacterial population.
Let us suppose we have
N_0
initial siderophore-producing bacterias in a closed system with dissolved iron. Monitoring the evolution of those bacterias, the dissolved iron, the siderophores and the chelated iron through a simple model will help our biologists tune their constructions.
