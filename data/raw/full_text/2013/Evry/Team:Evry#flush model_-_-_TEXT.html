Flush model overview
Introduction
In the very beginning of the project, we focused on iron absorption by the duodenum. We first had to model the behaviour of the duodenum regarding iron absorption to determine if a flush treatment strategy was viable. Then we wanted to model the flush treatment by simulating a flush of iron-chelating bacteria.
Disease model
We first modeled the iron absorption of a hemochromatosic patient using ODEs.
Here is the link to the disease model .
Treatment model
We then used the disease model as a base to develop our flush treatment model. It aims to answer the following question:
"Is it possible to chelate a significant amount of iron with a flush strategy?"
Here is the link to the treatment model .
