Overall project
Hemochromatosis is a genetic disease responsible for an abnormal iron accumulation in blood. This illness is due to a mutation on the HFE protein, which leads to a massive iron absorption by the intestines. As a consequence, the organism starts stocking the iron in tissues causing chronic deficiencies. Nowadays, the only efficient way to treat hemochromatosis is by bleed draining. This treatment is invasive and archaic compared to the actual advances in the medical field.
Our goal is to lower the iron absorption from the intestines by using an iron chelating bacteria. The gain will be to decrease the frequency of blood draining process and improve the patients lifestyle. We have two main objectives: developping an iron-sensing promoter and overexpressing the siderophore pathway under the control of iron concentration.
