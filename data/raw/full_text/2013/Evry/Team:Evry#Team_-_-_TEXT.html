Advisors
William Rostain
PhD Student in Synth-Bio team , iSSB
William is a PhD student in the Synth-Bio team of iSSB, Evry University. He is developing synthetic RNA circuits using computational methods. William discovered synthetic biology through his participation in the Edinburgh 2010 and Evry 2012 teams, and is advising the 2013 Evry team.
Cyrille Pauthenier
PhD Student in Jean-Loup Faulon's group, iSSB, École Normale Supérieure alumni
Cyrille participated the iGEM competition twice, in 2011 with Paris Bettencourt's team (Nanotube's project, semi-final finalist) and 2012 Evry team (French froggies project, Best Model and Best Human Practice in the semi-final) in which he helped founding with William Rostain and Tristan Cerisy. Chemist by training and alumni of the École Normale Supérieure he is currently doing a PhD thesis in metabolic engineering on yeast at Jean-Loup Faulon's group , in the institute of System and Synthetic Biology in France.
Tristan Cerisy
Master SSB (2012), Université d'Evry
PhD student, Genoscope , Université d'Evry
After my bachelor in Bioinformatics, I did the Master Systems and Synthetic Biology at the University of Evry. During the master, William and I decided to create the iGEM Evry team in November 2011, quickly joined by Cyrille. One year after the iGEM Evry team (with 15 people) got 2 prices in Amsterdam (Best Model and Best Human Practices Advance) and was qualified for the final in Boston! Now I am beginning a PhD in environmental systems biology. I study the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose by Clostridium phytofermentans in the French Sequencing Center under the supervision of Andrew Tolonen .
Pierre Parutto
Master2 Bioinformatics and Modeling student - UPMC Paris
As a retired modeler of the 2012 Evry team, I accumulated some experience on how to build models for biological systems. After graduating from the engineering school EPITA and an internship in metabolic network modeling in the BioRetroSynth group, I decided to do a master in bioinformatics from the UPMC university. I followed this year's project because it provides interesting challenges with the use of different modeling methods(FBA, ODE, probabilitiy) at different scales - the same kind of problems we faced last year. As a good IGEM fellow, I wanted to share my skills and pursue the Evry modeling immemorial tradition with the 2013 IGEM modelers in order to guide them through the harsh and merciless world of modeling of biological systems.
Iron Frog
SuperHero, Mascot and Frog
Iron Frog has joined iGEM Evry 2013 team to support the Iron Coli Project. However, its true identity remains unknown . Some pretends that it always yells “Yes, call me Iron Chassis” , while other rumors says that its catchphrase is “I’m not an Iron Chassis, I’m a free frog !” .
The only certain fact is that it likes French wines.
Instructors
Dr. Nicolas Pollet
Group leader of the Metamorphosis team at iSSB
Contact
After a PhD in developmental physiology at INSERM, he was a Marie Curie post-doctoral fellow at the German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg.  He is now a CNRS senior scientist, head of the Metamorphosys group at iSSB working in genomics and systems biology using the Xenopus frog model. Nicolas Pollet will participate to IGEM as Evry team supervisor for the second time this year.
Dr. Andrew Tolonen
Group leader Tolonen group at the Genoscope-CEA and Assistant Professor at the Université d'Evry
Contact
Andy studies the systems biology and genetic engineering of environmentally important microbes. His research focuses on Clostridium phytofermentans, an anaerobic bacterium from forest soil that ferments plant biomass to ethanol and hydrogen. He did his PhD in microbial genomics at MIT and his post-doc in the Church lab at Harvard Medical School. Andy also teaches microbiology and molecular biology undergraduate and graduate classes at the Université d'Evry and microbial biotechnology in the Evry-Genopole MSSB program. Andrew Tolonen has been a superadvisor of the Evry iGEM since it was founded in 2012.
Dr. Alfonso Jaramillo
Group leader of the Synth-Bio team at iSSB
Contact
After a PhD in theoretical physics, he was converted to synthetic biology for over 10 years. He gained international recognition in this field. He is now the team director of the Bio-Synth iSSB, working on the design, synthesis and characterization of biological regulatory artificial pathways. He is also one of the main teachers of the mSSB (synthetic and systematic biology master). He led Valencia iGEM team in 2006, and participated in the supervision of Valencia' and Paris' teams.
