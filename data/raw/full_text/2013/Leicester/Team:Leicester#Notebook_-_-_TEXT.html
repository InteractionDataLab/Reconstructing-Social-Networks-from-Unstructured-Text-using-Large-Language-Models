5ul NEB Buffer 3.1
0.5ul of EcoRI
0.5ul of PstI
19ul of dH2O
For each reaction add:
4ul of linearized backbone
4ul of enzyme master mix
digest at 37C for 30min
heat kill at 80C for 20min
Digestion of the limonene biobrick plasmid backbone (BBa_K118025)
Using clone 1.1 purified plasmid DNA
For the reaction adding:
5ul NEB Buffer 3.1
2ul of EcoRI
2ul of PstI
2.5ul of dH2O
38.5ul of DNA
digest at 37C for 30min

Ligation of insert to vector
For this experiment, two separate samples will be run; a control and the actual ligation.
Calculate appropriate vector:insert ratio and convert to a 1:1 ratio
Add the following substances
11.1ul of dH2O
1ul of QS Ligase *
5ul of 4xQS Buffer (vortex before use)
Mix thoroughly by pipetting
Incubate at room temperature for 5 min to create cohesive ends
Run 2.5-5ul of the ligation mixture onto an agarose gel to check ligation efficiency against a known marker. Add 1ul of dye to aid the visualization of results.
Transform it into competent cells (E.coli)
*For the control, no QS Ligase is added but its equivalent volume (1ul) is made up by dH2O.
The results from the gel electrophoresis show four lanes; two 1kb markers on either end (the first and forth lane), one control (the second lane) and the actual ligation results (the third lane). The control has two bands which shows that it has not been ligated, one band is around the 2kb area which is lightly-staining and one band is heavy-staining around the 5kb area. The actual ligation shows a lightly-staining smear, conclusive with the formation of a plasmid. The results are sufficiently good to carry on with the next phase of the experiment - the transformation.
Transformation of the limonene Biobrick (BBa_K118025)
Ligated with the pSB1C3 vector (restriction sites EcoRI, PstI)
Protocol:
Start thawing the competent cells on ice
Seperate 4 pre-chilled eppendorf tubes;
Resistance/Viability test
Ligation experiment with 10ul DNA
Ligation experiment with 5ul DNA
Positive control using 1ul RFP
Add 50ul of thawed competent cells and then the aforementioned volume of DNA to each eppendorf tube.
For each eppendorf tube, pipette the solution gently to mix. Ensure the cells are kept on ice.
Close the tubes and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42'C for 60 seconds
Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes
Add the 200ul of SOC (SOB + 0.4g glucose) media to each tube
Incubate the cells at 37'C for 2 hours
Plate onto petri dishes (ensure your petri dishes are labelled correctly):
For eppendorf 1, plate 100ul onto a chloroamphenicol petri dish and another 100ul of the solution onto a LB (luria broth) petri dish
For eppendorf 2, plate 200ul and 20ul onto two separate chloroamphenicol petri dishes
For eppendorf 3, plate 200ul and 20ul onto two separate chloroamphenicol petri dishes
For eppendorf 4, plate 200ul and 20ul onto two separate chloroamphenicol petri dishes
Incubate the plates at 37'C overnight
Results from the Transformation of limonene Biobrick (BBa_K118025) to the pSB1C3 vector
The Viability test showed colony growth on it, as expected
The Resistance test showed no colony growth, as expected
The ligation experiment with 10ul DNA showed no results for both the 20ul and 200ul plates. This was not expected.
The ligation experiment with 5ul DNA showed no results for both the 20ul and 200ul plates. This was not expected.
The positive RFP control showed red colonies, as expected.
Discussion: The results of the viability test indicates that the cells used were viable, and the resistance test indicated that the these cells did not have any intrinsic resistance to the chloroamphenicol antibiotic. The positive RFP control showed red colonies, which implies that the transformation was successful. Since our ligations showed no results, it can be assumed that there was a problem with the ligation experiment itself. Running the gel for Limonene biobrick digests (BBa_K118025) again for separation of the 2kb and 5kb fragment.
Extracted the 5kb fragment using Bioline gel extraction kit.

Incubate the plates at 37'C overnight
Gel electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis was done to confirm the presence of the purified DNA.
5ul of DNA was run, but after electrophoresis no band was present.
We assumed this was down to pippeting error and thus carried on with the transformation.
Results from the transformation plates
On the 01/08/2013 we plated the transformations containing the biobrick BBa_K118025.
Our transformations were successful
the plates contained different volumes of the transformation: 20ul and 200ul
the plate to test viability shows growth as expected
the plate to test resistance shows no growth as expected
there were two different different transformations that contained different volumes of ligated DNA, which were plated into different plates.
The 10ul ligated DNA plates showed growth
The RFP control plates showed growth as expected
the plates with the ligated DNA did not show growth as the RFP plates, this could be because the cells did not take up as much plasmid as the optimum RFP plasmid or not all the plasmid were ligated with the biobrick.
It is also important to notice that there is not much different in the number of colonies between the 5ul and 10ul plates.
Next steps
The presence of the limonene biobrick in the ligated product has to be confirmed. This would be done in 2 ways
a) Measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOC) - 3 separate groups of cells would be prepared for this experiment.
The first group would be transformed cells containing the ligated product.
The second group would be transformed cells containing only circularised pSB1C3 vector
The third group would just be competent cells
b) Miniprep of transformed cells containing the ligated product (from above results)
Digestion of pSB1C3 backbone
Master Mix (changes were made from the protocol)
5ul cut smart Buffer
0.5ul of XbaI
0.5ul of SpeI
19ul of dH2O
For each reaction add:
4ul of linearized backbone
4ul of enzyme master mix
digest at 37C for 30min
heat kill at 80C for 20min
this digestion was done as control to test if our colonies with the limonene biobrick is expressing limonene.
Circularisation of pSB1C3
For this experiment, two separate samples will be run; a control and the actual ligation.
Add the following substances
12ul of dH2O
1ul of QS Ligase*
2ul of the digested vector pSB1C3
5ul of 4xQS Buffer (vortex before use)
Mix thoroughly by pipetting
Incubate at room temperature for 5 min to create cohesive ends
Run 2.5-5ul of the ligation mixture onto an agarose gel to check ligation efficiency against a known marker. Add 5ul of dye to aid the visualization of results.
Transform it into competent cells (E.coli)
Gel Electrophoresis
Gel was run in order to confirm that the cirularisation experiment had worked.
The linearised pSB1C3 vector was used as a control.
The results showed that the circularisation experiment worked, as the linearised vector is represented on the gel while the circularised vector was cloudy and ran off the gel.
Transformation of circularised pSB1C3 vector
After confirming the presence of the circularised vector, it was transformed into competent cells
This was left to incubate overnight at 37 degrees Celsius
Reculturing of transformed cells
The transformed cells containing the ligated product from yesterday's experiment were recultured onto 2 agar plates.
The 2 plates were divided into 12 squares each.
Each square was streaked with colonies that were randomly chosen from the 5ul and 10ul plates.
The plates were then left on the bench for overnight incubation
Incubation in broth
The next day the some colonies from the recultured plates were incubated in broth.
This was done in preparation of the miniprep.
Isolation of ligated plasmid
The ligated plasmid- chloramphenicol backbone and limonene biobrick, were isolated from cells that were incubated overnight in broth by miniprep.
Protocols from both Bioline kit and Thermoscientific were used for the miniprep.
there were 6 tubes containing the plasmid.
The plasmid concentration in each of the 6 tubes were measured using nanodrop.
200ng of plasmid from each of the 6 different tube was used for digestion.

The lanes are in the following order:
Marker, Sample 5.1, Sample 5.2, Sample 5.3, Sample 10.1, Sample 10.2, Sample 10.3, Marker.
We were expecting to see a 2kb and 5kb band. These bands appeared for samples 5.1, 10.1,10.2 and 10.3. To further determine the composition of samples, we did a single digest on the samples.
Single digest
For samples 5.1, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 two single digests each were made with EcoRI and PstI, giving a total of 8 samples.
The samples are run on 0.8% agarose gel.

The gel shows the presence of 7kb bands for both digests of samples 10.1, 10.2 and the 5.1 sample, which was expected.
No bands appeared for samples 5.1.
For samples 10.3 there is a 2kb band, indicating that with the ligation, the chloroamphenicol circulized.

Dilutions show accuracy
Master dilution is sonicated and every 30mins a 30ul sample is taken to dilute twice (10ul of DNA in 90ul of TE buffer)
6 30ul samples are taken
Samples are then run on a gel
Running the gel from sonication series
Samples were taken from sonicated tube every 30min intervals, a total of 6 samples.
Each was diluted 100 fold to get a concentration in the range of 40-50ng/ul
5ul of DNA was taken from the dilution, to which 10ul of sterile water and 5ul of orange G was added
Samples were run against a 1kb ladder and control herring sperm DNA, which was not sonicated.
Denaturing sonicated DNA
Denaturing DNA by heat shock for 10mins in a 95C heat block
Adding 5ul of OG dye
Running both denatured and sonicated samples on gel
For just the sonication samples 1-6, 5ul of OG and 10ul of sterile water was added to 5ul of DNA.
5ul of 1kb ladder was used for 3 wells each.
The last 6 wells after ladder are the denatured DNA samples.
We were expecting to see fragmentation for the denatured samples.
There is no significant difference in between the sonicated samples and the sonicated and denatured ones.
There is a slight decrease in bands depending on the sonication time interval.
Suggestions are to use ultra-sonification to view the effects focused just on the sample.
Making nutrient agar plates and broth
Making up broth and agar solution to grow P. putida in.
For agar plates:
9.2g of nutrient agar medium
400ml of distilled water
For broth:
3.2g of nutrient broth
400ml of distilled water
Both were autoclaved for 45mins
Agar was poured onto 16 plates
Plating out bacteria
Freeze dried P. putida was rehydrated using 1ml of nutrient broth
The culture was aseptically transferred back into the broth containing tube
Mix
From that tube, colonies were streaked onto 6 plates and left to incubate over night at 30C
Growing bacteria in broth
100ml of autoclaved broth was added to 2 flasks each
The broth tube, containing the bacteria, was divided between flasks
Flask were left to incubate at 30C on a shaker overnight
Reculturing Bacteria
The P. putida grew overnight, which proved that we had viable cells.
The bacteria was then re-streaked to single colonies and left to grow overnight in a 37C incubator.
Isolation of P. putida DNA
8 1.5ml samples were isolated from each of the 2 broths that were prepared yesterday.
The first few steps of CTAB protocol was used to prep cells for DNA isolation;
The 8 samples were spun down at 10000 rpm for 5 mins.
The supernatant was discarded.
cells were then resuspended in 1ml of TE.
740ul of this new mixture was transferred to 8 new eppendorf tubes.
20ul of lysozyme was added to each of these 8 samples.
A maxwell robot was then used to complete the DNA extraction process.
Hydrodynamic shearing of Herring Sperm DNA
A 20G syringe was used ~24 times to squirt the herring sperm DNA in order to make it less viscous.
30G syringe was also used
This method seems to work better than the sonification.

Preparing samples to run on 1% gel
500ng of each of the isolated P. putida DNA sample is run on gel
Volumes are adjusted to 20ul per well accordingly (includes DNA, sterile H2O and OG)
5ul of orange G dye is added to each sample
5ul of 1kb ladders are used
For sheared DNA, dilutions were loaded
1ul of DNA was diluted in 9ul of 1xTE buffer to make up 10x dilution
1ul from 10x dilution was put in 9ul of 1xTE buffer to make up 100x dilution
Dilutions were nanodropped and the concentration for 100 fold dilution was 121 ng/ul
200ng of herring sperm DNA was run on gel
One lane was left for control, non-sheared DNA, also 100 fold dilution
Running gel of P. putida DNA and Herring sperm DNA
Samples in lanes goes as follows: 1 Kb ladder, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 1 kb ladder, 100x dilution of sheared herring sperm DNA, control 100x diluted herring sperm DNA
Running sonicated herring sperm DNA on 0.8% gel
3 lanes for running:
Sheared and sonicated
Unsheared and sonicated
Unsheared and unsonicated
5ul of 1kb marker is used
The DNA samples are diluted 100 fold and 200ng of sample is run.
Volume of sterile water is adjusted appropriately to make up 20ul of sample per well, including 5ul of orange G dye
Not visible on the computer file, but picture shows a very slight decrease in sheared/sonificated and unsheared/sonicated samples vs the unsheared/unsonificated control
The difference is not significant, but the viscosity has changed when mechanically spreading the DNA on polystyrene, though it is not that evident on the gel.

Repeating the combustion experiment
Blocks of both DNA and no DNA coating were made
Blocks are thicker than last experiment to observe the difference
Both DNA and no DNA blocks were sprayed with water and dried for equal treatment conditions
Second attempt at polystyrene combustion with DNA
Larger strips were used
DNA was spread on some and water was spread on some other
Strips were left to dry on the bench
some strips were cut from a block of polystyrene which was made with DNA
Each strip was burnt with a bunsen burner with a ruler and filmed to compare the rate of burning
Results were not as expected, DNA appeared to make no difference except a blacker remnant
Preparation of IPTG and Chloramphenicol plates
The IPTG/Chloramphenicol plates that were prepared earlier on (08/08/13) for the volatile organic compound (VOC) test were found to be contaminated.
Hence new plates had to be made using the below protocol;
PROTOCOL:
x2 400ml of already prepared and sterilized agar was obtained from the media kitchen.
The agar was microwaved using the lowest power level at 2-3 mins intervals until completely melted.
The x2 400ml agar were then placed in the 37 degrees room to cool.
After cooling, 800ul of cholramphenicol and 400ul of IPTG were added to one bottle whilst only 800ul of chloramphenicol was added to the second bottle.
The content of both agar bottles was then poured into petri dishes.
3 (chloramphenicol+ IPTG) plates were streaked with 5.1 ligated product (limonene biobrick and chloramphenicol backbone) from earlier and 3 others were streaked with 10.2 ligated product.
RFP colonies were streaked on 3 chloramphenicol resistance plates.
All 9 plates were Incubated overnight in a 37 degrees room.
Ligation of PCR products (TOD operon) using the Promega pGEM-T Vector System
The samples ligated were A (TODX), C (TODF) and E (TOBG)
The promega protocol was followed and it can be found at
http://www.promega.co.uk/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/0/pgem-t-and-pgem-t-easy-vector-systems-protocol/
To calculate the amount of DNA insert needed for each sample, we used the promega biomath calculator (www.promega.com/biomath). We used the 1:3 ratio of vector to insert.
Size of the PCR inserts (add 56bp to account for the primer)
TodX 544 + 56= 600
TodF 460+56= 516
TobG 807 + 56=863
Volume of DNA insert for each sample
A - 1.6ul
C - 1.1ul
E - 1.5ul
The samples were incubate at 4 degrees overnight to be transformed tomorrow morning.
Overnight Broth
RFP cells were incubated in luria broth in a 37 degrees shaker incubator
The cells would be minipreped tomorrow to serve as a backbone for the ligation of the TOD biobbricks.
How to make the broth
Using a 15ml centrifuge tube add:
5ml of luria broth
5ul of Chloramphenicol
Preparation of Ampicillin Resistance plates
Ampicillin resistance plates were made by adding 400ul of Ampicillin to 400ml of agar.
This would be used to grow the transformants of samples A,C and E (above) as pGEM-T Vector has AmpR gene.
Volatile organic compound (VOC) experiment of limonene biobrick/pBS1C3 backbone

Double Digest of the pSB1C3 miniprep
Samples 1 and 2 were transfered to new eppendorf tubes
In each tube it was added
39ul of DNA (miniprep)
1ul of XbaI
2ul of SpeI
6ul of cut smart buffer
12ul of sterile water
The samples were incubated at 37 degrees water buffer After the samples were incubated at 80 degrees to kill the enzymes
Transformation of TOD genes ligations done on the 02/09/13 using the pGEM-T Vector System I-A3600 (changes were made to the protocol)
Centrifuge the ligations reactions briefly.
Add 5ul of each ligation reaction to a sterile 1.5ml
Thaw the competent cells on ice. Mix the cells by gently flicking the tube.
Carefully transfer 100ul of the competent cells to the ligation reaction tubes.
Incubate the tubes on ice for 20 minutes
Heat-shock the cells for 45-50 seconds in a water bath at exactly 42C degrees. Do not Shake. Immediately return the tubes to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 950ul of room temperature SOC medium to the ligation reaction transformations. incubate for 1.5 hours at 37C with shaking.
Plating out the transformants
The transformants would be plated out on Ampicillin resistant plates that were prepared yesterday.
40ul of X-Gal and 20ul of of IPTG were streaked respectively unto the already made plates. (except the viability and resistance test plates) Below  is a list of the plates that were made;
1)x2 plates of positive control (no PCR product)- 20ul and 200ul plates 2)x2 plates of Background control- 20ul and 200ul 3)x2 plates of ligated product 1 (L1) - A- 20ul and 200ul plates 4)x2 plates of L2- C -20ul and 200ul plates 5)x2 plates of L3- E - 20ul and 200ul plates 6)x2 transformation control - (50pg of puc19) - 20ul and 200ul plates 7)x1 Viability control (only luria broth)- 200ul of cells 8)x1 resistance control (Only Amp agar) - 200ul of cells
All 14 plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees centigrade.
Transformation results
From the above results,colonies were found growing on the resistance control plate, which indicates that our competent cells already express ampicillin resistance, but this is not meant to be so.  Hence in order to confirm that our results are reliable;
colonies would be randomly selected from each of the two plates (20ul and 200ul) for the 3 TOD genes
These colonies would be cultured in luria broth + Amp. This broth would be incubated overnight in a 37 degrees shaker incubator.
Gel Electrophoresis
The double digest (pSB1C3) from yesterday was run on a 1% gel.
This was done in order to confirm that the digest worked and also to purify the pSB1C3 vector.
From left to right

Isolating microbes from CSE kits
We received some CSE kits from one of our participating schools.
It is to be noted that the polystyrene was not significantly degraded.
Distilled water was run down each of the 2 sides of the kit (the polystyrene and miscellanous sides)into 2 separate petri dishes.
a spreader was used to spread the sample from each of the petri dishes onto luria agar plates.
Thus each of the 2 samples from each CSE kit was incubated at 3 different temperatures (room temperature, 30 degrees and 37 degrees) Because we received 5 CSE kits, 30 plates were incubated.
Transformation of pSB1C3/TOD genes
Centrifuge the ligation
Add 6 ul of each ligation reaction to a sterile 1.5ml tube on ice
Thaw the cells on ice
Carefully transfer 50ul of cells to the ligation reaction. Gently flick the tubes and incubate on ice for 20 minutes.
Heat shock the cells for 45 seconds in a 42'C water bath. Do not shake. Immediately return the tubes to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 950 ul of SOC medium (at room temperature) to the ligation reactions. Incubate for 1.5 hours at 37'C on a shaker.
The controls for this experiment are the resistance and viability controls.
One tube has 50 ul of highly competent cells and SOC medium added to it.
The samples A (TodX), C (TodF), E(ToBG), positive control, and background control were plated on chlorophenicol resistant agar plates, at the volumes of 20ul and 200ul. A 100ul of only highly efficient cells and SOC medium was plated in a chlorophenicol plate and another 100ul was plated on a LB plate.

Results from double digest of isolated plasmid with SpeI and XbaI
Experiment conducted on the 05/09/13
Results from the transformation of pSB1C3/TOD genes
Experiment conducted on the 05/09/13
The positive RFP control showed colony growth on both the 20 ul and the 200 ul plates, but showed a mix of red and white colonies.
The background control also showed colony growth, which was not expected.
Upon further investigation, it was discovered the XbaI and SpeI have complementary sticky ends which could result in re-circularisation of the vector backbone to itself. This explains the presence of white colonies on the RFP positive control and the growth on the background control. To identify if this has occurred, another double digest will be carried out.
The samples A (TodX), C (TodF) and E(ToBG) all showed colony growth for the 20 ul and the 200 ul plates.
Miniprep of overnight broth
Following on from 06/09/13 result,overnight broth was prepared yesterday from the single colonies that had grown on each of the 2 plates shown on 06/09/13.
The broth, which contains cells that have been transformed with pSB1C3/TOD genes, was minipreped using the Omega Bio-Tek kit.
This would enable us to confirm which cells have the recircularised plasmid and those with the ligated product.

The pSB1C3/TOD genes were double digested with (XbaI and SpeI) & (EcoRI and PstI)
The master mix for the (XbaI and SpeI) was;
60ul of cut smart buffer 5ul of XbaI 10ul of SpeI 273ul of 5M Tris
The master mix for the (EcoRI and PstI) was;
60ul of cut smart buffer 5ul of XbaI 5ul of SpeI 278ul of 5M Tris
All 36 tubes were incubated overnight in 37 degrees room.
Tomorrow the plasmids that were isolated from the miniprep would be run on a 1% agarose gel to distinguish between cells that have the pSB1C3/TOD genes from those that have the recircularised pSB1C3 vector.
Meanwhile the plasmids from the miniprep were sent for sequencing this afternoon.
Dissolution of polystyrene in Limonene
This experiment was set up to decide how much limonene can economically dissolve polystyrene.
MATERIALS USED
20ml solution of 25% limonene.
8cm x 5cm x 2cm polystyrene block (thus volume of 80cm^3)
RESULT
It took ~33 minutes for the block to be completely dissolved
Dissolution of polystyrene
a 20ml solution of 50% Limonene was made to determine if the dissolution of polystyrene from 09/09/13 would occur faster.
as predicted, the 8cm x 5cm x 2cm PS block was completely dissolved in 9 minutes.
Gel electrophoresis
The samples from the double digest on 09/09/13 were run to confirm if the digestion worked.
From the results, we would also be able to distinguish between cells that have been successfully transformed with the ligated pSB1C3/TOD genes from those with the recircularised pSB1C3.
Results of the Gel electrophoresis
TODX Gel
Wells order: TODX1 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX1 (EcoRI/PstI); TODX2 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX2 (EcoRI/PstI); TODX3 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX3 (EcoRI/PstI); TODX4 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX4 (EcoRI/PstI); TODX5 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX5 (EcoRI/PstI); TODX6 (SpeI/XbaI), TODX6 (EcoRI/PstI). The expected results were that the we would see the TODX genes drop off in separate band in all the digestions in its respective size (600bp). However as it can be seen in the picture above only the samples cut with SpeI and XbaI had two fragments and they are the wrong size (~ 1Kb). The samples TODX (1, 2 and 6) were sent to be sequenced before the digestions and it showed that the pSB1C3 plasmid re-circularized. This is because the two enzymes have complementary sticky ends.
TODF
Wells order: TODF1 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF1 (EcoRI/PstI); TODF2 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF2 (EcoRI/PstI); TODF3 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF3 (EcoRI/PstI); TODF4 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF4 (EcoRI/PstI); TODF5 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF5 (EcoRI/PstI); TODF6 (SpeI/XbaI), TODF6 (EcoRI/PstI). This shows the same results as TODX above.
TOBG
Wells order: TOBG1 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG1 (EcoRI/PstI); TOBG2 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG2 (EcoRI/PstI); TOBG3 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG3 (EcoRI/PstI); TOBG4 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG4 (EcoRI/PstI); TOBG5 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG5 (EcoRI/PstI); TOBG6 (SpeI/XbaI), TOBG6 (EcoRI/PstI). This shows the same results as TODX above.

Gel order: TODX, TODX, TODF, TODF, TOBG, TOBG, pSB1C3, pSB1C3 (XbaI); TODX, TODF, TOBG, pSB1C3 (PstI) The picture above shows that the assumption that one of the enzymes did not working properly was wrong, as it shows the same result as the gel run on the 11/09/13.
Double digestion of the isolated pGEM plasmids ligated with the TOD operon genes (X, F and TOBG)
As the digestions with the plasmids that were stored in the freezer did not work new digestins were set up with the isolated plasmids from the overnight culture.
The pGEM-T plasmid contain the restrictions sites for PstI and SpeI, which are also present in the amplified TOD operon gene and the pSB1C3 plasmid.
To avoid the recircularization of the pSB1C3 backbone when ligating the genes with this plasmid, the double digestion was set up with the enzymes PstI and XbaI.
Another double digestion with EcoRI and SpeI was set up to test if the restrictions sites present in the TOD genes are not mutated. If the bands in the gel shows a linear band, it can be assumed that the enzymes cut the pGEM plasmids in its PstI and SpeI restriction sites.

Chemistry Lab Results
Two experiments were run in the chemistry lab.
Polystyrene Combustion
Two pieces of normal packaging polystyrene were burnt, which showed the flammability of polystyrene.
After two blocks of polystyrene made form the sugar given to the Leicester iGEM team by Jablite. One of them had DNA incorporated and the other had no DNA. We were able to establish that the polystyrene sugar provided to us from Jablite already had fire retardant chemicals incorporated, which did not allow us to test if DNA could work as a fire retardant for polystyrene.
Polystyrene dissolution in limonene
Gel electropheresis of pGEM-T vectors with the TOD genes
Gel order: TodX1, TodX2, TodX3, TodF1, TodF2, TobG1, TobG2, TobG3 (all cut with (XbaI/PstI); TodX1, TodX2, TodX3 (this were cut with EcoRI/SpeI)
The gel shows that once again the expected genes were not cut out from the plasmid. This could be because the restriction sites were mutated when they were cloned.
