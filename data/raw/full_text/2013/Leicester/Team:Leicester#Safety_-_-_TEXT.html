Saftey
The Leicester iGEM team Safety forms were approved on September 18, 2013 by Evan Appleton.
The bacteria been used are: E.coli DH5alpha - biosafety level 1
Pseudomonas Putida F1 - biosafety level 1
The team members were given a safety talk by a member of staff prior to the start of wet lab work. All the microbial cultures were handled using the appropriate safety procedures and precautions. All team members wore personal protective equipment and appropriate engineering controls. The E.coli DH5alpha and Pseudomonas Putida F1 presents no hazards to humans, animals and the environment, but as precaution the handling of these bacteria were limited to the a class 2 laboratory. The biobricks that were made were transformed into the E.coli DH5alpha, which cannot survive in the environment.
The project was undertaken within the guidelines set out by the University of Leicester Genetic Modification Sub-Committee. The local regulations allow cloning of genes from naturally occurring organisms and their characterisation without project specific approval.
