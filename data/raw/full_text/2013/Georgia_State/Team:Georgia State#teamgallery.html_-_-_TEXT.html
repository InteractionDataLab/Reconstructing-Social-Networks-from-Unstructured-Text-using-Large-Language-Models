Tyrel Heckendorf
Tyrel enjoys sitting and staring at colors.  There is controversy as to his exact origins, yet it is rumored by scholars that he comes from ancient Sumer.  His age is unknown.  He spends most of his time researching the paranormal, from aliens to psychic phenomenon, though it is known that some days he can be found in a tree or under a bridge.  His favorite animal is his pet Chimera, but gets annoyed at the amount of human sacrifices it needs.  Majoring in physics with a concentration in biophysics, he hopes to follow his idol Dr. Frankenstein.
Reza Alavi
My goal is to get into medical school after finishing my BS in biology.  I am the current member and officer of American Medical Student Association at Georgia State University (AMSA GSU) and also member of Tri-Beta Honor society.  Some of the main activates I have done are shadowing Emory Orthopedics department’s surgery supervised by Dr. Moore and volunteer at Grady Hospital.  My passion to human study and nature of living cells made me to choose biology as my undergraduate major.  I have been fortunate to participate in the iGEM research project supervised by Dr. Brewer at Georgia State University.
