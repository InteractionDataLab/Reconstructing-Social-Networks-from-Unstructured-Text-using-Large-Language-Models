Kristin/Lydia, Group C
Week 17: 9/2 - 9/6
We used the electrically component P. pastoris cells, that we had made in the second week of the competition, and transformed them with pGAPZαC + Linker + Mambalgin I. We plated the cells on YDPs + Zeocin plates.
We also linearized more of the pGAPZαC + Linker + Mambalgin with Avr II and purified the sample through gel isolation and purification in case our original transformation did not work.
Week 18: 9/8 - 9/13
We purified samples of the pGAPZαC + Linker and pGAPZαC +Linker + Mambalgin I through gel isolation and purification. We reran our confirmation digestions from 8/19/13 in a 1% agarose gel at 15 V for 999 minutes to get an improved picture of the gel.
We performed PCRs on the P. pastoris with pGAPZαC + Linker + Mambalgin I and ran on a 1% gel at 70 V for 120 minutes.
We ran an SDS page to recover the Mambalgin I protein but did not recover any proteins in our gel.
