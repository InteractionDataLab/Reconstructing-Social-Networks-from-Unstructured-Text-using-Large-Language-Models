DNA damage kinetic
Interestingly, AFB1 oxide is not a stable substance. AFB1  oxide will going through two possible reaction : spontaneous reaction with H2O  to produce a more stable and harmless AFB diol, or reacting with N7-Guanine to  produce AFB-DNA adduct and damaging cell’s DNA.
Mathematical representation of this phenomena can be  described by :
Parameters for DNA damage kinetic are :

We have a problem understanding  the unit of Kd (equilibrium constant for bind and unbind of AFB and DNA)  because it said mg/ml. So, we hypothetize that the reaction between AFB1oxide  and DNA can be assumed like enzymatic reaction (reaction equation of  DNA-AFB1oxide is analogous to Michaelis-Menten kinetic), so unit on the left  side will agree with the right side of the reaction.
In this model, we decide  to assume that AFB1oxide is “enzyme” and DNA is “substrate”. Here is the  parameter we input to Simbiology to simulate this model :
Notice that we state DNA  as the substrate for Michaelis Menten equation.
