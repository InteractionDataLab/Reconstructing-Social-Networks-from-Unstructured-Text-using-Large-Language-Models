CYP450 and AFB1 Enzymatic Reaction
When your system is  involving enzyme to transform or catalyze some reaction, basically you will  need one from two possible kinetic equation : Michaelis-Menten and Hill  equation. The basic difference between Michaelis-Menten and Hill equation is the  presence of n (hill coefficient) as a result of cooperative binding in Hill  equation.
After AFB1 successfully diffused into cell, the next  reaction is oxidations catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme. AFB1 is  enzymatically activated by CYP450 3A4 to a very reactive form, AFB1 oxide. AFB1  oxide is the genotoxic isomer and reacts efficiently with DNA at the Guanine.  In a simple way, this reactive form can damage our cell’s DNA and activated our  reporter gene to report the aflatoxin presence.
From the literature, we concluded that enzymatic reaction  between AFB1 and CYP450 is more likely to agree with Hill equation. We gathered  the value of all parameters we need to simulate this phenomena :
