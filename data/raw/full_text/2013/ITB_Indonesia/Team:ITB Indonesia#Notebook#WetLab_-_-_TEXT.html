Tuesday, 4 June 2013
Transform the plasmid to DH5α competent cell. We compared  number of colony from CaCl2 method and  from iGEM standard method. For each method,  we spread 20 µl and 200 µl culture.
Wednesday, 5 June 2013
Count the transform colony. Wehave found that the number of  colony from 20 µl with CCMB 80 Buffer gave   a better result than 200 µl with CaCl2 + Gliserin 15% buffer.  So, we are confident with iGEM standard method.
