Why Must be Whole Cells Biosensor ?
Accuracy and rapidity in monitoring toxin  compounds, pollutants, or the presence of a pathogen in the environment became  an important point from a measuring device (sensor). In the process of monitoring a  toxin or pollutant compounds, the conventional methods such as HPLC, GCMS, TLC  isn't practical to use and can only be used in the laboratory. So the presence  of  biosensor that utilizes biomolecule  compounds as the recognition tools is more prefered than conventional method.  Biomoleculs as recognition tool will interact with environmental factors to  produce an outputs that will be converted into electrical signal or optical  signal as the result from the measurement.
Enzymes are one of the biomolecule  that can be used as a recognition tool, the specificity to the substrate  provides a high accuracy for a biosensor device. However, the needs of high  purity level, causing a high cost to production biosensor. In addition, as a macromolecule,  enzyme stability is very less to be used as a biosensor device. So the use of  whole cell biosensor is more advantageous in terms of both economically and in  terms of ease of manufacture. The presence   a living cell as biosensor will automatically regulate the introduction  of a critical environmental point for a biosensor. So a whole cell biosensor is  more prefered and more advantageous as biosensor device
