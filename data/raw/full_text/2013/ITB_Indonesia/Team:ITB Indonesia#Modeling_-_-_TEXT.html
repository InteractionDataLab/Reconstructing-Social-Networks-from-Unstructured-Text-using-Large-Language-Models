Modelling Overview
Learn, Criticize, Share!
“What am I going to do to start my team’s  modelling?”
For us, getting the first  step to learn biological system simulation is little tough. We must review the  basic concept of biological system modelling, gather all information and  mathematical expression from other team whom their project is analogous to us,  and learn from scratch how to use Simbiology to simulate our system. Luckily,  our job at modelling is to simulate some basic biological and physical  phenomena on standard E. coli, which is used frequently by other team at iGEM  competition. Then, we have an idea : “We love the idea of sharing and open  source concept. How if we apply that to our modelling section?”
We design our modelling  section to be more easy to learn by explaining basic concept of some frequently  occuring phenomena and dividing it into bitesize chunk of information. This  basic modelling information not only helped other team who need some basic  guide to take their first step on modelling, but also educate everyone that  modelling and simulation is not as hard as you think!
We hope that everyone can  learn from our team, criticize our concept or model, and cut the learning  process to achieve better modelling for your team with shorter time. That is  the main goal of engineering, right? :)
If you have any question or suggestion,  don’t hesitate to contact us : synbio.itb@gmail.com
 
Overview
“By simulating our cell, we saved a lot of money and resources to  accelerate research progress!”
The main goal of this project is to create a working device  that can be used easily by user in agricultural business or industrial quality  control. However, achieving this goal means we need to construct standard  protocol to use our device properly, such as how much sample do our device  needs to start analyzing, how much cell do we need to make this device work  effectively, etc. Answering this question through wetlab and direct experiment  will waste a lot of time and material. By using software to conduct an in  silico experiment, we saved a lot of resources while we still achieve the goal  to construct a standard protocol for our device.
About  our device
Our device will be designed to be easily  used by user. So, we make a syringe-shaped device with a little amount of our  dried cell inside of it. User then insert medium to prepare the cell for  analyzing, and insert some amount of prepared sample (grinded sample dilluted  with alcohol). After several minutes, user can see the change in fluorescent  concentration as an effect of aflatoxin prescence.
 
General problem
To achieve a whole cell simulation, we must apply all  physical and biological phenomena into our modelling software. In this project,  we use Simbiology (computational biology toolbox from Matlab®) to handle the  integration of all phenomena.

As sample withdrawn into device, aflatoxin (B1 type) begin  to diffuse into our biosensor cell. Then, aflatoxin inside our cell is going  through enzymatic reaction with cytochrome P450 3A4 (common cytochrome in human  for drug metabolism) and produce Aflatoxin-B1-Oxide. This oxidized form of  aflatoxin B1 is very unstable and going through two possible reaction, the  first one is become a harmless Aflatoxin-B1-diol, the other one is to react  with DNA and causing damage to DNA. This damage then induced SOS response  system to produce our reporter chromoprotein.
