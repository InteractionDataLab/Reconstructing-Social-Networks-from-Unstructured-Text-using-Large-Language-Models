Model Integration : Putting it Together!
After all mathematical representation of  our phenomena has been successfully constructed, we build a biological system  model in Simbiology. It help us to achieve whole cell simulation to predict  analysis time, analysis performance of our device, and even helped us to  construct a standard protocol to use this device.
Our complete biological system model :
How  we simulate our whole cell biosensor?
There is some guideline to helped us  simulate our system :
Simulate device sensitivity. We want our  device to report aflatoxin presence as low as Indonesia’s regulation on food  safety (BPOM RI No. Hk.00.05.1.4057 stated that aflatoxin safety threshold in  Indonesia is 20 ppb).
We imagine our device would be shaped  like small syringe with our dried cell inside it. So user can measure  accurately how much medium and sample needed to enter our device.
Easiest way to convert ppm to molarity : parts per million = miligrams per litre
With that in mind, we run our simulation  with following parameters :
Parameter
Value
Aflatoxin concentration in sample*
6,4 x 10-5 mol/L
*) Based on Indonesia’s regulation on  aflatoxin
Using Simbiology, we simulate all step at  once and variate all parameters that matter to device and protocol design.  Then, we observe the result to find a good estimation about our design and  protocol.
Simulation  result
We try to simulate whole system with  different sample concentration using scan parameter. Logically, GFP production  rate will increase along with increasing aflatoxin concentration in sample. The  result of green protein synthesized versus time for each number of aflatoxin  molecule on sample is showed in curve below (bottom line is no aflatoxin presence in device, aflatoxin molecule increasing 6,4e-10 mole every run) :
 
Assume that sample volume is the same, so  increasing volume of medium will make aflatoxin concentration inside our device  more dillute. More dillute the aflatoxin concentration, the green fluorescent  protein concentration will be lower.
This curve can guide us to estimate the  time needed for analysis. We simulate the first 3600 seconds of our device and  we can see that fluorescent concentration for different aflatoxin concentration  can be distinguished clearly after 2500 second (approximately 40 minute).
Further  development
There is still a lot of task to do to  improve our modelling. Finding better parameter value that really close to our  project may be our first step. Rewrite and remove some redundant expression and  rule may be our next step. But our big obstacle is learning the concept of  modelling itself for the first time. Actually, we really amazed about how a  software can save a lot of money and other resources in research process. It  really bring an interesting discussion between engineer and science student to  look at the same project with whole new perspective, and it really important to  solve our world’s problem. This is really motivates us to share our modelling  progress as much as we can through “Open Source Modelling” spirit. We believe  that it will drive the synthetic biology development, especially for modelling  and in silico experiment, faster by positive two-way discussion and  constructive improvement between iGEM team all over the world.
