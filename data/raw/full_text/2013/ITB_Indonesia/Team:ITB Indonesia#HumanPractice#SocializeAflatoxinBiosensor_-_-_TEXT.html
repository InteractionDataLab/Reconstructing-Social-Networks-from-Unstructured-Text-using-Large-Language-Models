Socialization of Aflatoxin  Biosensor
Our last activity is to promote our project in developing aflatoxin  biosensor to ITB students, communities, alumni, and surrounding communities. We  aim to introduce ITB_Indonesia team and the device we built as a cheap, fast, and  easy-to-use aflatoxin-sensing cellular systems.
This activity was held during  ITB Class of '93 Reunion to maximize the exposure and to gain more audience. We  discussed with the alumni about our project and give them souvenirs as our  thank-you note for supporting ITB_Indonesia team. According to the data we  gathered, 32% of the respondents feel that developing a cheap and reliable  aflatoxin-sensing device is an urgent need.
