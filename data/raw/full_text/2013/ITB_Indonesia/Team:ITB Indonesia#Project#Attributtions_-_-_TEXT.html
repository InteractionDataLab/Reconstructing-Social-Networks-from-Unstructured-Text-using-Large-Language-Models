This project can be done by iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2013  team members and our collaborator. Super labwork started from May 2013 onwards.  Our team have worked well dan most dedicated for this project.
Early, the idea of whole cell biosensor for aflatoxin  detection was developed by team before superlawork. We planned and carried out  the experiments, modelling, human practice, and design of our device. We have  given directions from our advisors before but only a consultative function.
Project name: AFLATOXIN BIOSENSOR - Whole cell  biosensor for detecting aflatoxin
