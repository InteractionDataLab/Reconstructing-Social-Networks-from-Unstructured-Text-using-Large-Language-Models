Future System Overview
To  make Aflatoxin whole cell biosensor much better we had made a planning to  improve our system or add another modul in Aflatoxin biocensor system.
OVERVIEW OUR FUTURE SYSTEM
1. Reporter system in  Modul 1 (Activation AFB1 become Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide)
We  want our device is ready to detection Aflatoxin B1, so we use a constitutive  promotor to expression CYP3A4 gene. To make sure this modul work  easier or without using SDS PAGE we plan to  adding VioABE as reporter gene  to modul  I, so we can observed that expression of CYP3A4 gene successfully with easier  than before. VioABE is Chromogen that can convert L-tryptophan to  prodeoxyviolacein that have green color so when our device is ready to  detection aflatoxin, the device will show the green color.
2. Reactive sequens  (Another modul)
In research by   Bennasuti (1988) the active form of AFB1, Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide, will  adduct DNA at guanine base in N(7) position. Because the intensity of guanine  in DNA different in any region, he try to investigate in where aflatoxin will  more reactive to guanine in DNA. He discovered that pentanucleotide sequens,  5’-WXGYZ-3’, will make aflatoxin more reactive to adduct guanine in DNA.  The underline G means guanine base, and W,X,Y,Z can be another sequens. He  showed that nucleotide in W and Y position will influence the reactivity  gunanin base to adducted by Aflatoxin. The chances of every nucleotide  influence gunaine more reactivi in X position is G(1.0) > C (0.8) > A (0.3) > T (0.2), and in Y position is G (1.0) > T (0.8) > C (0.4) > A  (0.3). According to the research, we try to make a sequens that will enhanced  the reactivity of aflatoxin to adduct guanine in DNA, so the measurement of  concentration of aflatoxin will more accurate
3.  Modulating system in modul II for amplify the signal.
We want our device can detect aflatoxin more rapid and more  accurate so we need a system to enhance the signal from DNA damage to promotor  SOS. We plan to add POPS system for modulating signal DNA damage by aflatoxin  and send them to promote SOS.
4. Buoyancy  system (another modul)
The alfatoxin biosensor will produced in syringe pack. So it will  hard to observed the changing color as indication of the presence alfatoxin in  suspension form. So we try to concentrate the cell in one line using gas  vesicle that produce by cell when aflatoxin detected.
