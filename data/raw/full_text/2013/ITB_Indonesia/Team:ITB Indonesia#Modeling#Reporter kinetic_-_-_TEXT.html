Reporter kinetic
After DNA damage occured, naturally cell will activate SOS  promotor and SOS response. In our biosensor, SOS response will produce color  (chromoprotein) as a response aid for user.
AFB-DNA adduct will affect replication process and leaves a  single strand DNA (ssDNA). When ssDNA appears, therefore RecA* (activated RecA)  increases:

Calculated from previous step
Increasing amount of RecA* mediates LexA cleavage. LexA is  repressor on SOS promotor to keep SOS response stay inactive.

How LexA and RecA interact to build SOS response in cell is  showed in diagram below :

LexA, when there is no ssDNA presence in cell, repressing 3  genes : lexA (gene to synthesize LexA), recA (gene to synthesize RecA), and GFP  gene. LexA cleavage affects the GFP gene repressing strength and cell can start  producing GFP as a result of ssDNA presence in cell.
How we did it in Simbiology?
In Simbiology, we build  SOS response model as showed below :
To simplify this system,  we neglect LexA and RecA synthesis and focusing just on the GFP synthesis.
LexA repressing system can be written in reaction form :
