Introduction of Synthetic  Biology to Dago Communities
This activity was among the first we performed. We  gave questions to randomly chosen respondents, representing diverse background  such as high school students, college students, and working people. The  responses gathered illustrated that synthetic biology was fairly known by  college student but not many of them are aware about its potential and applications.  Through this activity, the students become interested to join in this field, more  aware of future prospects for developing synthetic biology in Indonesia, and of  course willing to support the ITB_Indonesia team for iGEM 2013.
