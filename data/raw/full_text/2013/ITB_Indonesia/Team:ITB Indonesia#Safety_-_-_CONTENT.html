Please describe.</STRONG><STRONG>a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others  working in the lab?</STRONG>
  Our team works with <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> DH5α  and BL21(DE3). According to Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), the wild-type  strain of <EM>E. coli</EM> may irritate the skin,  eyes, respiratory tract, blood circulation, and kidney. We modified the strain it  so we know the desired target sample by inserting the coding sequences, promoters,  and reporter genes. The insertion are not expected to increase bacterial pathogenicity  in any way. In addition to our work with <EM>E. coli</EM>, our team also  works with aflatoxin which, a carcinogenic and harmful chemical. To minimize  the risk, our team and the researchers in our lab always working safely by  using gloves, lab coats, mask, and goggles (if necessary). 
  The vector used in this  project is standarized, widely used, and resistent to some antibiotics such as  pSB1C3 (Registry of Standard Biological Parts). It is not expected to pose any  risk to human health, nor should such resistance determinants be passed to  other bacteria.<STRONG>b. Risks to the safety and health of the  general public, if released by design or by accident?</STRONG>
  Our project would not impact the environment in a harmful way. This can be seen  not only in the use of device but is also in the lab practice, all of waste  bacteria, medium, and disposable goods are discarded according to the  procedure. For waste bacteria and the medium, it must pass through destruction stages  by autoclaving to ensure all bacteria die before actually dumped into disposal.
  Additionally, we designed our whole-cell biosensor from modified <EM>E. coli</EM> strain. To maintain the pblic health safety  and health, our device is equipped with membrane that doesn't allow <EM>E. coli</EM> to exit the device so we ensured the safety  of the user. The final device will use freeze-dried <EM>E. coli</EM> which is susceptible to moisture  (hygroscopic) so that if there is any leakage in the device the freeze-dried <EM>E. coli</EM>  inside will be damaged and no longer works.  This system would reduce the risk to the public and environment.<STRONG>c. Risk to the environment, if released by  design or by accident?</STRONG>
  As detailed above we have thought carefully about how to prevent our modified  strains from entering the environment. Inserted genes are not expected to  increase the ability of the organisms to survive in the external environment and  cause harm to any other organisms.<STRONG>d. Risk to security through malicious  misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?</STRONG>
  In addition to the hazards posed by the lab workers, as well as the design in  our devices, the potential danger is also determined by abuse committed by careless  people. Modified strains could be used as a biological weapon to cause new  diseases and potentially mess up a country. This is most likely not going to  happen to our device, because we use freeze-dried <EM>E. coli</EM> that can only survive inside the device  and are not resistant to changes in humidity and oxygen levels. So if malicious  people try to steal the modified strains in our device, it can be ascertained  that the modified strains will defunct when the thieves want to use it.<STRONG>If your project moved from a small-scale  lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new  risk might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed  in parts a-d of the previous question.) also, what risk might arise if the  knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available ?  (Note: this is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)</STRONG>
  Our primary motive to design our project is public well-being, to improve  global health by monitoring the food safety. We have also foresee the public  and environmental implication as stated above. Actually, making our device can  be used commercially by the industry is a long way because it must pass through  stages of validation with a series of tests, such as allergicity test, toxicity  test, immunity test, and other test support. Although it has been ascertained  that the modified strains in our device will not work when there is a change of  oxygen and humidity levels the tests and validations still have to be  implemented for the health and safety of the user and the environment.<STRONG>Does your project include any design  features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic  chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to  participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.</STRONG>
  Yes, it does. We would engineer our strains to contain kill-switches. It is  associated with the disposable nature of our device. To ensure the safety and  health of the users and the environment, we want to apply the principle of kill-switches  so that after the aflatoxin detection process is finished, modified strains can  die in the time set, and can be safely disposed.<STRONG>What safety training have you received (or  plan to receive in the future) ? Provide a brief description, and a link to  your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.</STRONG>
  Specific safety training is not done by our campus, but the materials on health  and has become compulsory for credits in several courses at ITB. The name of  the course varies for each study program, such as the Health and Safety in  Bioindustry Workplace, Biosafety, Security in Process Factory, etc.. We'll have  a meeting and discussion with a number of faculty staff who are experts in this  field to discuss the biosafety our device, besides writing scholarly articles  about health and safety of using Genetically Modified Microorganisms.<STRONG>Under what biosafety provisions will/do  you work?</STRONG><STRONG>a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines</STRONG><A href="http://www.che.itb.ac.id/safety">http://www.che.itb.ac.id/safety</A></P><P><A href="http://www.tf.itb.ac.id/files/2011/11/SOP-K3-Laboratorium-Teknik-Fisika.pdf">http://www.tf.itb.ac.id/files/2011/11/SOP-K3-Laboratorium-Teknik-Fisika.pdf</A></P><P><A href="http://www.tf.itb.ac.id/files/2011/11/KEPUTUSAN-sop-kedaruratan.pdf">http://www.tf.itb.ac.id/files/2011/11/KEPUTUSAN-sop-kedaruratan.pdf</A></P><P><STRONG>b. Does your institution have an  Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you  discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your  project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.</STRONG>
  Our institution has a committee dealing with environmental security, health,  safety, and (K3L). But they didn’t concerned in biosafety of modified organisms.  In addition, our biosafety committe (K3L) deals only in laboratory safety and  environment security.<STRONG>c. Does your country have national  biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide the link to these  regulations or guidelines if possible.</STRONG>
  Yes, our country does. It can be accessed in <A href="http://indonesiabch.or.id/tentang-bkkhi/">http://indonesiabch.or.id/tentang-bkkhi/</A><STRONG>d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual,  what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? </STRONG>
  BioSafety Level 1<STRONG>e. What is the Risk Group of your chasis  organism(s), as you stated in question 1 ? if it does not match the BSL rating  of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are  taking.</STRONG>
