CYP synthesis
CYP450 3A4 is a very important catalyst to transform the  neutral form of aflatoxin to become DNA damaging form of aflatoxin oxide. CYP  that constituvely produced in the cell is represented by a set of equation  below.
This set of equation is  can be applied to another protein synthesis phenomena :
1. RNA is transcribed from  DNA. (DNA appeared on both side to state that DNA is not consumed nor produced  because of this reaction)
2. Protein then  translated from RNA
3. RNA degrade by time.  (Symbol on the right side represent ‘null’)
From literature, transcription polimerase rate of E. coli is  approximately 55 nucleotide/s [1] and ribosomal translation rate of E. coli is  approximately 18 residue/s [2]. With the length of CYP450 gene is 2000  nucleotide, we can calculate the transcription rate constant of CYP gene (ktrc)  and the translation rate constant of CYP gene (ktrl).
We calculate our  transcription and translation rate simply by dividing the rate of transcption  polimerase rate or ribosomal translation rate with the length of involved gene.
Website like  bionumbers.org can be really useful to gather this kind of data.
