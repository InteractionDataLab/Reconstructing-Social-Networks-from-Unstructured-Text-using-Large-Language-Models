How Dangerous Aflatoxin for Our Bodies?
Aflatoxins  are carcinogenic and mutagenic, heat stable (237-289oC), and can  accumulate through the food chain. The presence of aflatoxins especially  aflatoxin B1 on  food such as peanuts,  milk, and corn  can increase a person's  risk of  liver cancer. According to data  from the International Agency for Research of Cancer, 1 in 4 people who have  liver cancer caused by aflatoxin exposure [1]. From that fact we know that  aflatoxin exposure can become  serious  problems to our health.
