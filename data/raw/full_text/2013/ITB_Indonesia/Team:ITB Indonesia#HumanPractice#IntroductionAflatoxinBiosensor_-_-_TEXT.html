Introduction and Discussion  About Aflatoxin
This activity was conducted by distributing aflatoxin-related  questionnaire to surrounding communities. The responses gathered demonstrated  that people's understanding about aflatoxin was so low. Our data showed that 41.3%  of ITB students don't know about aflatoxin, 43% don't know what implications  aflatoxin brings to human health, and 39% don't know how to prevent and manage  these implications.
This was unfortunate since aflatoxin poisoning might cause  fatal consequences such as liver cancer. These findings were in accordance with  recent data which explains that 58% people in developing countries felt an urge  to know about aflatoxin-related issues. We try to address this problem by  explaining about aflatoxin and its health effects through small-group  discussions, educational videos, and social media promotions. We hope that  through these activities, people become more informed and be able to protect  themselves from severe implications of aflatoxin poisoning.
