Human Practice Overview
For ITB_Indonesia team, human practice is a good opportunity to  introduce and to promote synthetic biology to wider audience. We organized  several activities such as introduction of synthetic biology to Dago  communities, discussion about aflatoxin, and socialization of aflatoxin  biosensor as iGEM project of ITB_Indonesia team.
The activities are directed  towards neighboring communities, ITB students, and students from other campuses  in Bandung area. These targets are chosen due to our concern and interest for improving  communities around us. People's knowledge about synthetic biology is varied  widely. Some already heard about the field, some showed limited understanding,  whereas others pretend to comprehend the field to the point that they consider  synthetic biology as a discipline which is capable to make something out of  thin air.
Our Human Practices are:
Introduction of Synthetic Biology to Dago Communities
Introduction and Discussion  About Aflatoxin
Socialization of Aflatoxin  Biosensor as iGEM Project of ITB_Indonesia Team
