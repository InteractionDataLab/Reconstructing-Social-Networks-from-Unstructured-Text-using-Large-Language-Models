Aflatoxin Whole Cell Biosensor: Towards Indonesian Food Security
Not  only for our health, Aflatoxin exposure can become serious problems for  economics and food security in certain developing countries. Legumes is still  an alternative staple food after rice and tubers. According to the data  from  Department of Agriculture of  Indonesia, nuts consumption rate in Indonesia is still very high at around  0.5404 kg / capita / year [1].  Poor   process production and bad storage system, can lead the growth of the  fungus from class of Aspergillus. The presence of fungal species Aspergillusflavus  and Aspergillusparasiticus can contaminate food such as nuts, corn, and maize with  a toxin known as aflatoxin.
Here’s  the data of level of aflatoxin exposure on food in certain developing countries
Tabel  1. Food contamination by aflatoxin in certain developing countries [2]
According  to data reported by BBalitvet, Research and Development Division, Indonesian  Ministry of Agriculture, 40.7% of corn production in Indonesia has been  contaminated aflatoxin which exceed the defined quality standards ISO (> 500  ppb). Not only corn production, level exposure of aflatoxin in peanuts  production, processed peanuts, milk, and other food product in Indonesia have  exceeded a set threshold by SNI [3].
Too  much of food contaminated by aflatoxins cause a  rejection of food exports that resulting reduction in foreign exchange. the  presence of foods contaminated by aflatoxin that weren't detected increase the  number of aflatoxin exposure during the process of production, storage, or  distribution. Aflatoxin exposure on food    increasing the number of food items that do not qualify for the  industrial requirement which of course would lead to huge losses. A lot of  food  wasted cause a domino effect, such  as doesn't insufficient for domestic food demand, food prices are soaring, up  to the need for increased food imports. So the detection of aflatoxin  contamination in food is necessary, in order to break the chain of aflatoxin  contamination in foodstuffs. aflatoxin whole cell biosensor arise as an answer  from aflatoxin exposure problems. We hope this device can help Indonesia  and  other developing countries to  improve the food security.
