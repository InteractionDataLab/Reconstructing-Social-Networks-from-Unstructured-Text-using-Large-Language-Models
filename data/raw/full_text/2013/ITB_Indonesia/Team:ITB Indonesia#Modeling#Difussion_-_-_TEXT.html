Difussion
First thing to do is calculate how much aflatoxin would  enter the cell every time. Aflatoxin diffused into cell through simple  diffusion mechanism, it means that aflatoxin difusion is drived by  concentration gradient.
To simplify our model, we  assume that aflatoxin homogenely diffused into cell
0. General equation  of diffusion through membrane
Diffusion is frequently modelled if the system needs to  transport some molecule through cell membrane. Mathematical model for  diffusional phenomena through membrane is :
Where n represents the number of molecule involved in  diffusion (So, dn/dt can be stated as “molecule flux through cell membrane”). Parameters  of the equation :

I. Permeability  aflatoxin-membrane
Permeability value between solute and solvent is very  specific for each case, and finding an analogous case to our system is really  difficult. We try to tinker some diffusional equation to find permeability  between aflatoxin and membrane with really few data.
Generally, permeability can be described through this  equation :

To determine the value of diffusivity constant, we use  Stoke-Einstein equation
where the radii value of solute (r) can be determined with  the help of molecular weight data
So, to simplify our equation, we try to  find the correlation between diffusivity constant and solute molecular weight.  It can be done through dividing two sets of case (diffusion of protein with  well-known molecular weight and diffusion of aflatoxin) and the result is

How we did it in Simbiology?
We create a reversible  reaction with customized reaction rate (‘Unknown’ kinetic law), where k_permin  as forward reaction rate and k_permout as backward reaction rate. k_permin and  k_permout is stated by repeatedAssignment rule :
k_permin = P*Acell*((container.mol_out/container) -  (insideCell.mol_in/insideCell))
k_permout = P*Acell*(-(container.mol_out/container) +  (insideCell.mol_in/insideCell))
Notice that k_permin and  k_permout is the same as dn/dt in membrane diffusion general equation
II. Aflatoxin  membrane cell area
When we discussed with team, there is still one problem in  this model :
“Our biosensor is a  live device and can keep replicating even in the middle of analysis process.  How it will affect this model?”
Good thinking! To simulate the effect of cell growth to  diffusion phenomena, we modify the diffusion equation. Membrane cell area will  be increased along with cell number, and it affected by cell growth.
We simplify this problem  by assuming cell growth is like growing sphere. When the cell number doubled,  it can be stated that the membrane cell area and cell volume doubled too.
Cell membrane area can be evaluated every time by this  equation :
where the value of A0  represents membrane cell area of one E. coli cell and n is cell number at  certain time. The value of n can be determined with cell growth kinetic :
So, the equation’s final form to evaluate cell membrane area  every time become :
With the same principle, we can evaluate cell  volume every time :
To gather the value of A0 dan V0, we use the data that  bacteria has area to volume ratio 3:1 [4]. Cell density and wet cell mass of E.  coli can be known from literature

How we did it in  Simbiology?
Uncheck the “Constant  Value” in parameter A (cell area) and insideCell (cummulative cell volume).  Then we apply this rule (because we use “rate” as rule type, the equation must  be written in the form of first derivative or dx/dt) :
Another perspective from  our model instructor, Mochamad Apri, said that involving cell growth into  diffusion equation will be valid if our system’s analysis time is far more  greater than cell growth rate. If our system’s analysis time is below cell  growth rate, it will be wise to assume that cell growth is negligible for  diffusion phenomena.
III. Average  aflatoxin concentration in each of our cell
On previous section, we simulate diffusion phenomena by  assuming all cell is gathered into one big cell with volume = n*Vcell and  membrane area = n*Acell. How we calculate aflatoxin concentration in each of  our cell? The answer is simple, just divide aflatoxin molecule in “big cell” with cell number at recent time. But how can we do this simple division in  Simbiology? Simbiology is designed to handle reaction equation, and we need  another way to do this simple equation.
After long time searching, the solution is really easy. We  just copy the same reaction rate from diffusion phenomena to this “distribution” reaction (actually there is no such reaction in real world, it  just helped us find the average aflatoxin concentration) and divide it by  cellNum (parameter for cell number).
diffusion reaction  rate                   : k_permin –  k_permout
distrib reaction rate        : (k_permin – k_permout)/cellNum
We hope this will help other team who face the same problem with us.
