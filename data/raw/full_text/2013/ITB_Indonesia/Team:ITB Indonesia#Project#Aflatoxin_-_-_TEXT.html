Aflatoxin Whole Cell Biocensor
Aflatoxin  Whole Cell Biocensor  is a system to  detect the presence of aflatoxin in the environment  by using E. coli strain BL21 as a chassis.  There are two modules are used to compile the aflatoxin sensor systems. Module  I is a module to activate aflatoxin.   Module II is a module which is used as a reporter system utilizing the  SOS response in E. coli cells. When E. coli cells exposed to aflatoxin,  aflatoxin  will enter the cell and  activated by the system in module 1 form the active molecule. This molecules  are not stable and will attack the DNA. DNA damage will activates the system at  the  module II to produced green  fluoresence protein as an output from module II system.
Modul I.  Activation Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) become Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide
Alfatoxin  is a mycotoxin that is carcinogenic and mutagenic. To be able to cause  mutations or DNA damage, AFB1 must undergo activation by Cytocrhome P450 prior  to Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide. Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide is the active form of AFB1 which  can cause damage to DNA.
Cytochrome  P450 is a superfamily  proteins that  catalyze the activation of a variety of organic compounds such as intermediate  compound in the metabolism proses, or xenobiotic compounds. Cytochrome P450  found in almost all domains of life except in E.coli. Cytochrome P450 3A4  (CYP3A4) is one member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of proteins derived  from human. CYP3A4 has a native function to activate xenobiotic compounds in  the human body, including aflatoxin [1].
In  this module synthetic CYP3A4  gen [BBa_K1064004]  from humans was used. CYP3A4 has a high efficiency to convert AFB1 into its  active form (Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide). Doesn't like other types such as  CYP1A5   that much change AFB1 into Endo- AFB1-8,9-epoxide  (not active)   or even converted to AFM1 [2]. Naturally CYP3A4 is a membrane protein ,  so we cut the signal peptide to prevent CYP3A4 protein translocated to the cell  membrane after translation. Localization CYP3A4   in cytosol is intended to only activate   AFB1 that had enter the cell so it'll reducing the error in  measurement  aflatoxin concentration  in the environment. The activation of AFB 1  into Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide has been modeled.

Modul 2. Utilisizing SOS Response to Detection the Presence of Aflatoxin
Aflatoxin activated into  Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide by CYP3A4 as a catalyst.  Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide is an unstable compound and could not be isolated. The  compound can adduct DNA at guanine bases produce a compound  trans-8,9-dihydro-8-(N7-guanyl)-9-hydroxyaflatoxin B1 and intercalated in DNA  [3]. On the E. coli, DNA adduction by Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide cause transversion mutation  of nucleotide bases G à T cell  triggering of the SOS response.

SOS Response is a response of E. coli to  DNA damage. Mechanism of SOS respone to repair damaged DNA involving multiple  gene. There are two types of proteins that are involved in the mechanism of the  SOS response in E. coli, the LexA which is a repressor protein and RecA  which for   reducing the level of expression of the gene encoding LexA
Under normal condition, the LexA Protein  which is  a dimer protein binds to the  operator and represses  the transcription  process of genes that play a role in DNA repair. When cells undergo UV exposure  or mutagenic compounds that cause DNA damage, DNA damage will be detected when  the process of DNA replication occurs. DNA pol III will fail at  replicating  DNA, produce  a ssDNA. At that time, RecA protein binds to  another protein with ssDNA and continuing DNA replication  via homologous recombination. When RecA  protein binding to ssDNA the protein becomes active to cleavage protein LexA on  operator lead to transcription  genes  that play a role in the repair of damaged DNA [4]
SOS response system on module II is  utilized to regulate the expression of the gene encoding GFP. DNA Damage due to  attack by Exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide would trigger the SOS response,  for that it we utilizing the SOS promoter  that regulates expression of the gene encoding GFP, so the presence of  aflatoxin can be detected.

Results of agarose gel electrophoresis  of restriction analysis and PCR results showed that the construct of the system  on module 2 has succeeded

To check that the system in our  construct running or not, we test the construct   by exposured  E. coli containing  plasmid constructs  in UV light. Results  of fluorescence microscopy observations showed that the cells were carried out  for exposure to UV light produces a green fluoresence whereas control cells  that are not exposed to UV light do not produce fluoresence. It shows that the  system in modul 2 runs with a good  to  take  the DNA damage signal as a signal  for GFP gene expression
