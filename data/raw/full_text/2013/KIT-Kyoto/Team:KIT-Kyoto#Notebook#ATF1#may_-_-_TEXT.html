May 16th
We performed PCR to amplify the ATF1 gene.
Primers:
Forward:5’-TACGCCTCGAGATGAATGAAATCGATGAGAAAAATCAGGCCCC-3’
Reverse:5’-ATATTGCTTAGCAGGGCCTAAAAGGAGAGCTTTGTAAATGGAGCAAAGC-3’
Reaction composition is as follows:
Buffer
50µL
dNTP
20µL
Primer mix
1µL
DNA sample
0.5µL
KOD-FX
2µL
H2O
26.5µL
total
100µL
We could not get any PCR product.
 
 
May 17th -20th
Changed PCR conditions with another DNA template. We performed PCR of the ATF1 gene again.
Primers:
Forward :5’-TACGCCTCGAGATGAATGAAATCGATGAGAAAAATCAGGCCCC-3’
Reverse:5’-ATATTGCTTAGCAGGGCCTAAAAGGAGAGCTTTGTAAATGGAGCAAAGC-3’
Reaction composition is as follows:

We transformed a plasmid carrying theATF1 gene into E.coli.
This plasmid was obtained from iGEM DNA distributions kit 2012 (plate 2, o-7).
We could see approximately 50 colonies and cultured furthermore.
