Rapid check of the insert by colony cracking
Add 45 µL of cracking solution(3% w/v SDS ,50mM Tris -base ,pH12.6) into each tube.
↓
Suspend a small quantity of the colony in a tube using a sterilized toothpick.
↓
Incubate the tube at 65°C for 10 minutes.
↓
Add a drop of 10x Loading Buffer.
↓
Add equal volume of phenol/chloroform.
↓
Mix with vortex.
↓
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 3 minutes.
↓
Apply the supernatant to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
↓
Stain the gel in ethidium bromide solution for 10 minutes.
↓
Plasmid DNA can be detected by UV-illuminator as a band between genomic DNA band and low molecular size RNAs.
DNA purification and  precipitation
Mix  350 µL of sterilized water and 50 µL of 3 M sodium  acetate with DNA sample.
Mix  DNA solution with equal volume of phenol/chloroform by vortex.
Centrifuge  at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, then transfer the supernatant into a new  tube.
Add  equal volume of 2-propanol, and mix by turning the tube upside down.
Centrifuge  at 14,500 rpm for 10 min at 4˚C.
Carefully  decant the supernatant.
Add  adequate volume of 70 % ethanol.
Centrifuge  at 14,500 rpm for 5 min at 4˚C.
Carefully  decant the supernatant.
Dry  in the desiccator under vacuum for 5 min.
You  can get dried DNA pellet.
PCR
Adjust  the concentration of each primer to 100 pmol/µL with  sterilized water.
Mix  10µL of forward and reverse primer solutions with 80 µL  H2O in a new tube (final primer concentration is 10  pmol/µL).
