We designed and constructed these parts originally.

BBa_K1049000
This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the production of aromatic odor in yeast cells. we submitted a new BioBrick part that encodes an aldehyde degradative enzyme.
BBa_K1049001
This is the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase of yeast. We have submitted a new BioBrick part, which was the ATF2 gene encoding the enzyme that produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
BBa_K1049000
This device converts isoamyl alcohol to the odor isoamyl acetate.Sequence and Features.
1,SDS-PAGE
We constructed ATF2 generator. (BBa_K1049002) Our team KIT-Kyoto 2013 constructed this part for the purpose of measurement. T7 promoter is an IPTG-inducible promoter. We added 20 µL IPTG (100 mM) to our genetically modified E.coli after cultivation at 28˚C and 37˚C. 2 hours after, we extracted soluble proteins from it by FastBreak™ Cell Lysis Reagent and did SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
ATF2 gene encodes AATase, which is about 62 kDa. The consumption of protein marker is like this.
Myosin 200 kDa β‐Galactosidase 120 kDa Bovine Serum Albumin 95 kDa Glutamine dehydrogenase 68 kDa Ovalbumin 50 kDa Carbonic Anhydrase 36 kDa Myoglobin 27 kDa Lysozyme 20 kDa Aprotinin 10 kDa
You can find the band at lanes which are added IPTG just beneath the band of 68 kDa.
2,Growth curve
We measured the turbidities of the transformants every 2 hour and made the growth curves. We transferred the transformant to 200 mL flasks and add 660 µL IPTG and 108 µL isoamyl alcohol to them after 2 hours of the start. We measured the turbidities every 2 hours. The measurements were carried out for 10 hours.
LB 100 mL
ampicillin 150 µL
sample 50 µL
IPTG 660 µL
isoamyl alcohol 108 µL
37°C, 125/min
In addition, we measured the turbidities of the transformants without adding IPTG and isoamyl alcohol too. We measured 4 samples; ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2-pET-15b + IPTG, empty pET-15b, empty pET-15b + IPTG.
As the result, ATF2-pET-15b transformants grow well relative to control(transformants having empty pET-15b vector). We propose the folllowing hypothesis. Isoamyl acetate indicates a stimulatory effect of growth on E.coli cells when compared to isoamyl alcohol so that transformants having ATF2-pET-15b grow well relative to control.
And ATF2-pET-15b without IPTG grow well relative to ATF2-pET-15b add IPTG. It is explained by the following hypothesis. When we add IPTG to the transformant having ATF2-pET-15b, ATF2 protein (AATase) is expessed in bulk in the transformant. A massive amount of AATase has a potential to surpress the growth.
3, Bioassay using Drosophila
Next, to confirm the activity of AATase, we added isoamyl alcohol after IPTG induction and cultivated for about 2 hours. We used E. coli cells carrying the empty vector (pET-15b) as a control and compare it with the E.coli cells carrying pET-15b-ATF2 after addition of isoamyl alcohol. To compare the production of isoamyl acetate, we carried out a bioassay using Drosophila because Drosophila favors the fruit odor like isoamyl acetate. [1]
After the addition of IPTG and isoamyl acetate, the culture was impregnated into the filter and placed in a case containing 10 Drosophilas. We monitored the behavior of Drosophila.
This is the result. After 1 hour, 7 flies gathered to the ATF2. These results clearly indicate that ATF2 produces isoamyl acetate from isoamyl alcohol.
4,The comparison of the ability of ATF1 and ATF2
In addition, according to the previous study [2], the ability of ATF2 protein to produce isoamyl acetate in yeast is higher than that of ATF1 protein.
It is known that both ATF1 and ATF2 protein are involved in producing isoamyl acetate.
In 2006, MIT iGEM team submitted ATF1 coding sequence. (BBa_J45006) Our new part, ATF2 coding sequence, fall under the category of the improvement of function existing BioBrick Part, BBa_J45006. Herewith, our team, KIT-Kyoto 2013 iGEM team, meets the additional requirements for a Gold Medal.
