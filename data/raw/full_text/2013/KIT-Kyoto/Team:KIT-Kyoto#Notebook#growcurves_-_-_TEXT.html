August 20th,21st
We transformed four kinds of plasmid DNA into E.coli cells.
These plasmids were obtained from iGEM DNA distributions kit (listed below).
We added 10ul of water into the samples and left them for 5 minutes before using the parts.
(1)2012KitPlate2,6O(pSB1A3)
(2)2012KitPlate2,8A(pSB1A2)
(5)2013KitPlate5,15J(pSB1A2)
(6)2013KitPlate5,24E(pSB1A2)
We obtained colonies of sample (1), (2), and (6), but did not "5".
We prepared sample (5) again and got it.
We cultured each transformant in 3 ml LB liquid medium containing ampicillin (37°C, 125rpm overnight).
August 23rd~September 3rd
We measured the turbidities of the transformants (OD600).
We transferred the transformant prepared on 8/22 to 200 mL flasks.
We measured the turbidities every 30 minutes.
But we could not get positive data.
The data are indicated below.

September 4th~7th
We measured the turbidities of the transformants at hourly intervals and made the growth curves.
We transferred the transformant prepared on 9/3 to 200 mL flasks.
We measured the turbidities every 1 hour.
The measurements were carried out for 12 hours.
