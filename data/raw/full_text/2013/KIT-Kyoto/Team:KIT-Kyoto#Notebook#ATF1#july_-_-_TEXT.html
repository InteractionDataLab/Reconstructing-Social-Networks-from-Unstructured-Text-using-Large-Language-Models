ATF1
July 1st
We performed PCR at 53˚C and 54˚C. (annealing temp.)
We applied DNA sample to the agarose gel electrophoresis.
-53˚C ver.-
We detected several bands.
-54˚C ver.-
The bands seems wrong size.
1. We applied DNA sample to the blue gel electrophoresis and purified DNA.
 [Consequence]
The band appeared 1600bp.
2. We performed PCR at 51˚C and 52˚C. (annealing temp.)
