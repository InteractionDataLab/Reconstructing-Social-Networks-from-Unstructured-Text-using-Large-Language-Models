Use this page to answer the questions on the safety page .
1. Please describe the chassis organism(s) you will be using for this project. If you will be using more than one chassis organism, provide information on each of them:
Species
Strain no/name
Risk Group
Risk group source link
Disease risk to humans? If so, which disease?
1
E. coli (K 12)
DH5α
1
https://2013.igem.org/Safety/Risk_Group_Table
No. It is not considered to be hazardous to health (Chart et al. J. Appl. Microbiol., 2000, vol. 89, 1048-1058; MSDS from New England Biolab).
2
E. coli (K 12)
BL21(DE3)
1
https://2011.igem.org/Team:Michigan/Safety
No. It is not considered to be hazardous to health (Chart et al. J. Appl. Microbiol., 2000, vol. 89, 1048-1058; MSDS from New England Biolab).
2. Highest Risk Group Listed: 1
3. List and describe all new or modified coding regions you will be using in your project. (If you use parts from the 2013 iGEM Distribution without modifying them, you do not need to list those parts.)
Part number.
Where did you get the physical DNA for this part (which lab, synthesis company, etc)
What species does this part originally come from?
What is the Risk Group of the species?
What is the function of this part, in its parent species?
1
BBa_K1049000
lab
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
1
It is the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase of yeast.
2
BBa_K1049001
lab
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
1
This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the production of aromatic odor in yeast cells.
3
BBa_K1049002
lab
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
1
This gene encodes an enzyme involved in the production of aromatic odor in yeast cells.
4. Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks? Please describe.
a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
No risk of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety araised in our KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2013 project. All our lab work was performed following the guidelines of the safety standards required by biosafety level 1 and the guidelines established by Japanese goverment and our institute.
b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
No. We developed the parts using genes derived from S. cerevisiae under the control of T7 promoter. Since S. cerevisiae is a quite harmless and edible microorganism, our materials are harmless.
c. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
No. Our genetically modified E.coli is not pathogenic for humans and the expression of introduced genes can not be induced without IPTG.
d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
No. Our parts do not contain any gene sequences that cause potential danger and disservice.
5. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? (Consider the different categories of risks that are listed in parts a-d of the previous question.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? (Note: This is meant to be a somewhat open-ended discussion question.)
We plan to develop a genetically modified E.coli with the ability to produce "fragrance". If our parts were widely abused, our environmental odor and smell might be changed dramatically and people might be suffered from it.
6. Does your project include any design features to address safety risks? (For example: kill switches, auxotrophic chassis, etc.) Note that including such features is not mandatory to participate in iGEM, but many groups choose to include them.
No. Our parts are derived from yeast genes encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase and esterase. Our project would not affect safety risks.
7. What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution’s safety training requirements, if available.
We attended a training seminar of the gene recombination experiment, provided by our institution.
8. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you work?
a. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines
http://www.kit.ac.jp/01/prescriptions/act/frame/frame110000136.htm (in Japanse)
b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised with your project, and any changes you made to your project plan based on their review.
Yes. We have a bio safety committee , and our project has been monitored by them. The leader of this committee is Prof. Yamaguchi, a supervisor of our team. Furthermore, our institution has a committee of the recombinant DNA experiments, this committee permitted our project. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. In addition, Prof. Yamaguchi and other supervisors fully support our experiments.
c. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.

http://www.lifescience.mext.go.jp/files/pdf/n815_01.pdf (in Japanease)
d. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab? (Check the summary table on page 3, and the fuller description that starts on page 9.) If your lab does not fit neatly into category 1, 2, 3, or 4, please describe its safety features [see 2013.igem.org/Safety for help].
Our lab corresponds category 1.
e. What is the Risk Group of your chassis organism(s), as you stated in question 1? If it does not match the BSL rating of your laboratory, please explain what additional safety measures you are taking.
Our chassis organisms which we use this year correspond the Risk Group 1.
