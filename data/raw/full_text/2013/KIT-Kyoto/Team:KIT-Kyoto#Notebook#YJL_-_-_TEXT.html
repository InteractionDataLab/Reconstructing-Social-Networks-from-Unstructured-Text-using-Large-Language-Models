13th August
We designed the PCR primers to amplify YJL068C gene.
 
 
19th August
1.   Make Primer mix
We added 102.2 µL and 100.3 µL H2O to the forward and reverse primers, respectively, to make 100 pmol/µL solutions.
We obtained 10 µL of each primer solution and added 80 µL H2O
 to make the 10 pmol/µL primer mix.

(The correct band is 1400bp.)
We changed annealing temperature to 54°C and 57°C and tried PCR again.
We detected a correct size DNA band around 1400bp.
The clear DNA band was amplified at 54˚C (annealing temperature).
