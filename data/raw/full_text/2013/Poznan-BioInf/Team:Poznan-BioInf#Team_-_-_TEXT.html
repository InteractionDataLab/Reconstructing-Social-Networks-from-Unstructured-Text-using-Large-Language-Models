Official Team Profile
Students
We are 'happy tree friends' who found that the concept of synthetic biology is what they've dreamt of in high school.  Fascinated by biology, fascinated by computer science. Studying on two faculties, on two universities that have created a joint curriculum for people like us - bioinformatics. We mix biology and computing science in one test-tube  to find our 'bioinfo' way.
