One day of early Autumn our lab have been visited... by a local television crew! They made short interviews with each of us and filmed our work in lab so we could  not only tell a few words about project, iGEM competition and our financial support but also show our work, tell more about our aims and ideas.
Head of our Team, Weronika, gave a short interview for local radio Merkury during Scientists' Night - an open family science fair. She told a few words about our project and aims of our work.
In October we gave an interview for students radio Afera, a non-commercial radio created by students of Poznan University of Technology. We took part in Students Patrol audition and we told our academy mates about our project, iGEM competition and financial support we got.
We are the founders of the Poznan University of Technology Bioinformatics Students' Research Group (KNBI). To promote the idea of synthetic biology among non-biologists we have run a series of open lectures for students of computer science, bioinformatics, and even cognitive science. We have also promoted those lectures, and our project, on the KNBI's Facebook profile.
