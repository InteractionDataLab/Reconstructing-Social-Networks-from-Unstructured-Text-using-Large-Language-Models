Our project presents a synthetic digital system based on a widely-used electronic circuit called a multiplexer. Using  transcriptional analogs of classic transistors - transcriptors - we are building basic memory units, SR-latches, under common control of a strobe signal, joined to form a memorizing signal chooser - a biological SR-multiplexer.
