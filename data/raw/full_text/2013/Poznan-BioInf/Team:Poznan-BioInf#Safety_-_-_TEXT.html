Safety
Human practice
We have used a safe strain of E. coli (K-12) - DH5alfa. We have been using DNA sequences originating from Bxb1, T901 and PhiC31 phages and reporting fluorescent proteins from Aequorea victoria and Discosoma sp., none of which pose any danger to humans.
We have also designed the strobe signal not only stopping expression of the final products of the system, but cutting the reading frame and the memory unit (RAD) out.
Safety forms were approved on September 22, 2013 by Evan Appleton.
