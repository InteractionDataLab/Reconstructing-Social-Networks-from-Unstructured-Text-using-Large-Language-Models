Project has the ability to be applied in the control of metabolic pathways used in different fields of industry as in dairy production, biofuels and alcoholic beverages. The latter has a great diversity of products, and however, the beer is particularly special for our community since the city of Monterrey has important called Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery Group.
It was founded by Don Isaac Garza on November 8, 1890, the same year the company released its first product to the domestic market: Carta Blanca Beer and this receives recognition gold medal at the world fair in Chicago. The dedication of these workers, which has allowed the development of  a wide range of products make it today  the largest of the market; It signed an agreement with the Heineken Beer Company positioning itself as a world power in its area. The company has a tradition for 120 years, looking for the steady progress in all its industrial processes.
The company offers an extensive portfolio of beverages on the market and meets the taste of different consumers in select countries around the world. Each year, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma invests in research to improve fermentation.
The most used by the company yeast is Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, their natural habitat is on the surface of the fruit, and it has been used since for thousands of years for the production of alcoholic beverages. It is one of the most studied and used in the field of genetic manipulation as a host to the genes of other organisms, for basic research in biotechnology.
Thus, the RNA thermometers can activate the yeast to detect certain temperatures. At the moment we do not work with temperatures suitable for the production of beer. One of the goals in the future would be to use the RNA thermometers to be or other industrial processes modifying the way temperatures each time more accessible.
The team proposes to circuit developed this year as a means to control temperature, essential to create suitable environments in the different stages of fermentation for the production of beer. The RNA thermometers can activate the production of yeast to detect certain temperatures. At the moment we do not work with the suitable for the production of beer. But one of the goals in the future, would be to use the RNA thermometers in a way increasingly more easily and use the circuit in is or other industrial process.
We conclude, that Thermo-coli is an excellent option to reduce costs and optimize the process of alcoholic fermentation. This will help the Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma to achieve its mission of being the most profitable company of Latin America in its scope, which will allow the social development of our community.
