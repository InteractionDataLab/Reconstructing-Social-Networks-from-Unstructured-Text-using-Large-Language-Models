Preparation of E. coli Calcium Chloride competent cells
Inoculate a single colony into 5 mL of LB media without any antibiotics and grow overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking.
Inoculate 1 mL of the desired strain into 100 mL of fresh LB, use a 500 mL flask.
Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until 0.3 - 0.4 sideOD600
Put the flask on ice. Pre-chill 50 mL centrifuge tubes and the centrifuge itself at 4°C.
Centrifuge 50 mL of the culture at 8,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
Remove the supernatant and add 10 mL of cold CaCl2 0.1 M. Vortex until the pellet is resuspended.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes, shake the tube once in a while.
Centrifuge at 8,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and add 2 mL of CaCl2 0.1 M. Resuspend carefully using a micropipette.  Keep always on ice.
Mix the two preparations in a tube and store on ice, or use for transformation.
Note: The competent cells can be stored on ice up to two weeks.
Preparation of E. coli Rubidium Chloride competent cells
Inoculate 5 mL of LB broth with DH5α and incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with vigorous shacking.
Use small culture to inoculate 100 mL of LB broth. Incubate at 37°C with shacking until the culture reaches an optical density (OD595) 0.4-0.6.
Transfer to two 50 mL centrifuge tubes.
Spin at maximum speed for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Remove supernatant.
Add 20 mL of TBF1 and resuspend the pellet.
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes.
Pour off supernatant.
Centrifuge 5 minutes at 8000 rpm/4°C.
Resuspend cellular pellet with 4 mL of TBF2.
Place aliquots of 100 µL at -70°C.
Heat-shock transformation of E. coli competent cells
Add 50 µL of Ca+2 competent cells to a pre-chilled centrifuge tube. Keep always on ice until step 4.
Add plasmid DNA (100 ng) or ligation (up to 5 µL) depending on DNA concentration.
Use 1 µL of a 1 ng/µL DNA sample as positive test in a separate tube. It is recommended to use a DNA-free negative test tube as well.
Chill the tube on ice for 20 - 30 minutes.
Expose the reaction mixture to a  42ºC 1 minute heat-shock.
Put the tube on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200 µL of antibiotic-free LB media.
Incubate at 37ºC for 20 - 30 minutes.
Spread the appropriate quantity of cells (50-200 µL) on selective LB agar plates.
Incubate overnight at 37º C.
The positive plate must have around 1,000 colonies as an optimal (1X106 transformants per µg supercoiled DNA).
Notes: Until heat-shock, handle the tubes from the upper part to avoid warming the cells. Low temperature is critical for successful transformation. Avoid transforming with more than 5 µL of ligation mixture, as ligation buffer may reduce transformation efficiency.
Preparation of Electrocompetent E. coli cells
Inoculate a single colony of E. coli in 5 mL of LB media. Grow overnight or for 5 hours at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm.
Inoculate 2.5 mL of the previous culture in 200 mL of LB media in a 2 L flask. Grow at 37 °C shaking at 300 rpm until the culture reaches an OD of 0.5 - 0.7.
Chill the cells on ice for 10 - 15 minutes and then transfer the cells into a pre-chilled centrifuge bottle.
Centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 10 minutes at 2 °C (Beckman J-6M).
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cold water. Add 200 mL of cold water and mix well. Centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 10 minutes at 2 °C.
