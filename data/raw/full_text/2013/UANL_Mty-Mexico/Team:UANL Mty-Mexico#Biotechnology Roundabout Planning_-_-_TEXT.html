Plannig the Genomics Biotechnology Roundabout [ Back ]
About the planning of this event, first of all was with the purpouse of spread the function and examples of the principal fields of biotechnoloy, using material of high quality. About the content there would be 6 modules with 6 different colors, each one representing the areas we already talked about.
For the constrution the team worked for 4 large months with 2 official frequencies per week being these ones the Fridays and Sundays. The staff were constructing the exposition 5 hours per day and it was really hard. Som days with cold, other ones with rain but always being a good experience for each one of them:
Designing Images"
Every image in the exposition was designed y the team members from item. All of that help us to understand how we can impact trough images the development of ideas.
Designing Activities"
The activities were designed in order to be the most expressive and descriptive as possible. This aspect was very important because it allowed us to describe the subjects we use.
Materials "
We use a lot of materials of high quality for exhibitions, including special plastics, wood, colorful stickers and more.
Biotechnology Students "
Some students from our school helped us in the exposition construction, although we didn't knew how to use a hammer.
Biotechnology Students Again
Working a lot
Hard Working"
We worked full days to finish the construction of the exposition. Now we know it was a good work and that all people who went to the exposition loved it.
Finally, we thought for being a good scientist is really necessary know about arts and design too for this kind of situations, and of course to know how to coordinate a lot of people for making things like this possible.
