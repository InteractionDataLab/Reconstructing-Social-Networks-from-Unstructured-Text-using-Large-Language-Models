Media and Interviews
Entrepreneurial interview More
As part of our HP, we contact two experts in the biotechnology field, working in different enterprises, and did them an interview about the processes their enterprises develop, and the way synthetic biology could help them. This activity was done in order to show the great impact the synthetic biology could have in the business area, and also the help that different biologic projects can give to the society and technology.
On the Radio! More
During last summer, the team was invited to present our work to different radio stations, were we talked about our wetlab project, E.cologic, and the human practices projects, specially the Synthetic Biology Tunnel expo. This expo gained attention from the Public Secretary of Education (SEP) and also from two local television channels; these channels made two news reports, respectively.
