In this project, we use two synthetic RNA thermometers. The first one, which allows translation at temperatures over 37ºC, was designed and tested by Neupert et al. (2008) . The second, which allows translation at temperatures over 32ºC, was designed and tested by TUDelft team . We appreciate the contribution of both research teams and thank them for making our project possible!
