Laboratory (Workplace)
For the use of chemical reagents and laboratory equipment we will follow the biosecurity rules imposed by Laboratory Biosafety Manual (3rd edition) – WHO, 2004:.
All the personal of the laboratory is aware of the biosafety rules, regulations and they comprehend the biosafety management plan. Also before using any kind of equipment for the first time, they have to read the manual and count with advisory. These are some general guidelines that we follow in our laboratory:
The working area consist of level one laboratory on which only authorized personal and members of the team are allowed.
It uses to keep neat, clean and free for material that are not pertinent for the work.
The surface is decontaminated before start to work and before leaving.
All the material are cleaned after being used and the ones with biological material are decontaminated.
Doors and windows are closed at least it is necessary to open them.
There is always a copy of the operation manual in the laboratory.
The laboratory is well illuminated and is designed to be easy to keep clean and to be resistant.
h) There are some storage spaces are place inside the laboratory and other are outside, they are aisles adequate to hold the material and supplies.
Also a hand washing basins is placed in the laboratory.
A binnacle is used to control the activities done in the laboratory and follow the program. In case of emergency, the medical kit is always available.
There is an adequate electricity supply and emergency lighting to permit safe exit and to support essential equipment.
To enter in the laboratory is required to use laboratory lab, closed shoes, and the hair up if it is long.
Safety glasses, visors, gloves or other protective devices are worn when it is necessary. Also, all chemical and biological material is removed in special cans or decontaminated.
Biocontainment
Our project does not raise any safety issues other than the normally associated with working with typical cloning strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli and molecular biology procedures. Thus, in regard to researcher safety, our project doesn’t pose risks that aren’t contemplated in normal microbiology and molecular biology training for a BL-1 laboratory.
Work in the laboratory involves risks, but have taken action to minimize and prevent the accidental release and minimize risks:
Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics, and storing food for human consumption must not be permitted in laboratory areas. Food must be stored outside the laboratory area in cabinets or refrigerators designated and used for this purpose.
Decontaminate work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with appropriate disinfectant.
Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials before disposal using an effective method. Depending on where the decontamination will be performed, the following methods should be used prior to transport.
The laboratory supervisor must ensure that laboratory personnel receive appropriate training regarding their duties, the necessary precautions to prevent exposures, and exposure evaluation procedures.
All students involved with the project were informed of the established security arrangement to strictly comply with the rules.
Also, prior to the beginning of the experimental procedures, all of the team members were given a course on biosafety, focused mainly on biological hazards, chemical reagents and general BSL-1 laboratory safety concerns and security procedures.
The proper use of containment equipment as well as personal protective equipment.
Materials to be decontaminated outside of the immediate laboratory must be placed in a durable, leak proof container and secured for transport.
Everybody is advised of special hazards with chemical substances of biological material, and the laboratory advisor make sure all members of the team follow the standard practices and procedures, and that they know what to do in case that an incident occurs.
We are the first line of defense for protecting ourselves, others in the lab, and the public from exposure to hazardous agents. Protection depends on good microbiological practices and the correct use of safety equipment and through these procedures, none of the genetically modified bacteria should have a chance of being introduced into the environment. The constructs that we have built to test our systems in the laboratory all will use a safe, non-pathogenic bacterial strain of E. coli commonly used in labs worldwide.
