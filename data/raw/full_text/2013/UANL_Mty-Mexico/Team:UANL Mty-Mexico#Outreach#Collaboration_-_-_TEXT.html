Collaboration and team work
Collaboration with CIDEB-UANL Team
We conducted a training workshop to get team CIDEB-UANL ready for the [ IGEM HSD 2012 ] and [ IGEM HSD 2013 ]. They did great! They came 2nd runner up in the competition and were awarded with best model and honorable mention for best presentation. This year, we continued mentoring them, and we are very proud to say they were again finalists, and ended 2nd runner up!
Collaboration with National Polytechnic Institute
First of all, we attended to the first forum of Synthetic Biology at the National Polytechnic Institute - Interdisciplinary Professional Unit of Biotechnology (IPN - UPIBI ) on 7 and 8 August 2013 where we met various personalities of the field such as Dr. Augustino Martínez, MB José Antonio Pavón , Gerónimo Villanueva , Dr. Osvaldo Reséndiz and Dr. Pablo Padilla , and other IGEM teams . The UANL_Mty – Mexico’s iGEM team gave a presentation about what is iGEM and the challenges a team faces when they perform synthetic biology. We answered questions and encouraged young people to adventure into the Synthetic Biology field. We agreed to establish a permanent  collaboration network with the IPN students.
