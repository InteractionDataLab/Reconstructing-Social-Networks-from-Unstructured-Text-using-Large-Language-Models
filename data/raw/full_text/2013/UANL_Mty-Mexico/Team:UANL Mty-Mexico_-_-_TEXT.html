Project
Our main purpose is to provide a proof of concept for the use of RNA thermometers to regulate the expression of a transcription factor in artificial genetic circuits. We also provide guidelines for the standard characterization of other RNA thermometers and point at possible applications.

Math
We developed a model for the characterization of the dynamic behavior of RNA thermometers. We propose some of the parameters of our model to be used as quantitative points of reference to help us understand and reliably compare the behavior of RNA thermometers.

Human Practices
We created and presented two major didactic exhibitions to massively educate the crowd about synthetic biology. We also organized the most innovative symposium of Biological Sciences in Latin America, with a strong focus on synthetic biology. We personally reached around 14, 000 people. Check it out.
