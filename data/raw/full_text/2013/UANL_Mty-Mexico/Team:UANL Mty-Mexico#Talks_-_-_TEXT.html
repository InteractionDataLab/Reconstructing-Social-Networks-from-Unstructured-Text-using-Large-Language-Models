Conferences and Activities
With the aim of promoting synthetic biology and the promotion of  iGem projects and their applications in various areas, the team iGEM UANL made many and varied activities exhibitions, talks, lectures and dynamic activities. Each activity was strategically planned to educate in a fun and original way the kids, young and grown-ups about synthetic biology and their applications as iGEM projects. Review the following sections and find out the activities that were carried out!
School Visits
One of the many ways to achieve a better diffusion of iGEM and Synthetic Biology is through students. We gave a presentation/talk that addressed students in a clear, simple and concise way; we also performed some experimental demonstration, like banana DNA extraction and the simulation of an iGEM competition.
