Dynamic and Itinerary Exhibitions
As researchers and students within the fields of Genomics Biotechnology and synthetic biology, we are aware of the importance that our society learns about things we do for the good of everyone. IGEM UANL team is convinced that the best way to teach is through dynamic and interactive activities, which is why we performed two exhibitions museum-type schedules of games, activities, explanations and colors for all ages. Come and take a look at these great activities!
Synthetic Biology Tunnel
Last year, we reached about 7,000 people in the exhibition we called Synthetic Biology Tunnel 2012 . This year we continued to grow as we went to a small town named Cuatrociénegas, Coahuila, a place known for its great metagenomic diversity, whose people we believe should be aware of what the treasure they possess. Synthetic Biology Tunnel 2013 was a great experience both for local people and for us.

Genomics Biotechnology Roundabout
This year we also designed a new exhibition for all ages to explain the application of Synthetic Biology in the main Biotechnological areas: medical, industrial, genomics, environmental, agriculture and marine. The Genomics Biotechnology Roundabout was exposed in two editions where we caught the attention of more than 4,000 people of all ages.
