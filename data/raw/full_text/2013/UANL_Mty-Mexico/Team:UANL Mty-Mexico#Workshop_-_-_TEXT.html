Introductory workshop for iGEM team UANL 2013 [ Back ]
In mid-January 2013, students interested on becoming members of the iGEM team UANL 2013 were invited to a four day introductory workshop with the main objective of training them to develop the basic theoretical knowledge for the competition by introducing them to basic Molecular and Synthetic Biology topics, to the tools of Genetic Engineering and to what the competition consists in.
Description
Objectives
• To prepare the students from the Genomics Biotechnology Degree that are interested in participate in iGEM in the Colleague Division of mentioned workshop in its version 2013 with introductory topics to molecular biology, engineering, nucleic acids manipulation, biology with data processing and synthetic biology. • To homogenize the interested students knowledge in an easy, clear and precise panorama about the principal laboratory techniques that are used in synthetic biology in order to make them develop the ability to work in the laboratory. • To aid the students with the doubts that can be presented during the workshop in order to increase their interest in molecular and synthetic biology.
The workshop took place in the Biology School School at the UANL, three hours per day. The topics were the following:
Day 1 January 16 DNA What is DNA? Composition of DNA and its properties Genomics What are genes? Genomics organization Day 2 January 17 Proteins Function of proteins Types of Proteins Genetics Egineering Characterization through restriction enzymes Day 3 January 18 Synthetic Biology BioBricks™ in the Parts Registry DNA clonation: How can we obtain multiple copies of a gene? A detailed view to the BioBricks™ Assembly using Building Standards Day 4 January 19 Checking of the iGEM projects Project requirements: • Development of ideas • Parts construction • Human Practices • Poster • Wiki • Presentation
By the end of the workshop, besides of acquiring the basic knowledge required for the competition, the students who come from different generations and disciplines, had the opportunity to interact and meet their team mates, strengthening their relation and making the project an experience they can fully enjoy.
