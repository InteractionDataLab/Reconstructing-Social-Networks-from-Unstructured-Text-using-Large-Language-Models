In collaboration with the Student Association for Biotechnology and Genomics, we organized Genobiotec13 , the most innovative International symposium on Biological sciences in Latin America. Genobiotec13 will be held in November 21-23rd 2013 in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Up to 2,000 participants are expected. 
The congress will have a strong focus on synthetic and systems biology, counting with the presence of leaders from the international academic and corporate synthetic biology community . We have received applications from researchers and students from over six countries and all around Mexico, including other iGEM teams.
