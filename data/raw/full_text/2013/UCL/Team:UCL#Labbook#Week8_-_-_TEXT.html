Week 8
Bacterial Lab
Monday 22nd July
Transformation of our competent cells with plasmid YB3110 was carried out.
Tuesday 23rd July
No colony growth was observed on Ampicillin plates indicating no plasmid uptake. Transformation was repeated with YB3110.

Friday 26th July
Once again our cells were unsuccessful in taking up the YB3110 plasmid. We concluded that our batch of competent cells were not competent and so these will not be used in any further experiments. A new batch of competent cells are to be generated.
