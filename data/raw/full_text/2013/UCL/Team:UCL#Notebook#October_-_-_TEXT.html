Robin took charge of the collaboration on Modelling for Westminster iGEM team.
FYi finalised the circuit drawing which was mounted on the Wiki. The digestion of cmv+MMP9 recombinant plasmid showed promising results.

The official UCL team shirts were collected.
The team reunited at Robin's in order to upload the remaining wiki content before the wiki freeze at 4:59 am.
We also took advantage of this event and had our group photo taken with all of us wearing our brand new Spotless mind T-shirts! We also included Stjohn's photo who wasn't able to be with us tonight but with whom we'll be finally reunited in Lyon! Yey!
