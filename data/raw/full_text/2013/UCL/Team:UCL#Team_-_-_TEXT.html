TEAM PROFILE
This year, UCL has a highly interdisciplinary team of eleven undergraduates, all with strong and often conflicting views on what our project is, how it should be done, and what it could become in the future, but all genuinely delighted to be trying to bring synthetic biology to the brain.
ATTRIBUTIONS
A great number of people, scientists and non-scientists, have helped our project to come to life. We have received invaluable advice and inspiration, and would like to recognise their contributions here. Indeed, it has been a genuine pleasure to work with all of them.
PRESS
UCL has a strong background in iGEM, and we are looking to build on excellent foundations this year. As such, we are publicising several interactive aspects of our human practices, most notably “Eternal Sunshine” and our Creative Writing Competition, and are hoping to generate significant media attention through our efforts.
