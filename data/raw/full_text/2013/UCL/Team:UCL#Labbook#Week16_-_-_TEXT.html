Monday 16th September
Results of the inoculations of transformations of 13/09 in 4xcmp: all showed growth apart from falcons 5.3, 5.2, 1.14 and 1.2. Glycerol stocks of the rest of 19 inoculations were made.
Minipreps of the above inoculations were made only for 1.3, 1.7, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.15, 1.20 and 5.1 due to lack of chromatographic columns.
Nanodrop result of the above minipreps showed concentration values below 16.0 ng/ul. Analytical digest of miniprep samples 1-9 (prepared the day before) as well as of 5.1 and 1.15 (which showed concentrations of about 15 ng/ul) with E and P

Samples were briefly centrifuged and incubated at 37O C for circa 3 hours. After that, samples were supplemented with 3 ul dye and run on a gel.
Purification of 8 PCR reactions to amplify Zeo and BB hangers
These reactions (total volume of 400 ul) were left in the thermocycler at 4O C overnight. The samples were run on a gel together with 70 ul dye and the correct bands (1.8 kb) were gel extracted. This gel was purified and eluted in 40 ul Elution Buffer. The nanodrop readings of these were of 91.9 ul/ul with purity (260/280) of 1.96.

These tubes were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes then used 5 ul from each for transformation using W3110 cells. Plated 10 ul, 90 ul on 5xcmp selective plates and then incubated overnight at 37°C. Next day, there was no growth on neither plates
Two gel were loaded using xba1 digests of recombinant zeo candidates
Ten ul of sample 1(showed correct band pattern) was used from glycerol stock to make an inoculation in 4xcmp 10 ml LB broth.
Inoculation of MMP9 glycerol stocks
These were made using 2 ml LB broth, 8 ul material from the glycerol stock and 4xcmp (8 ul cmp).
Wednesday 18th September
Carried out miniprep of 16 MMP9 glycerol stocks candidates which were inoculated overnight the day before; another miniprep was set for 2 samples from zeocin ligation 1 (prepared the day before) which was inoculated overnight (10 ml LB and 40 ul cmp). Nanodrop results of the above

Thursday 19th September
Focus on MMP-9  - Minipreped samples from the 18 inoculations, only 16 of these had growth.  - Took the 16 inoculations forward to minipreping.  - Made glycerol stocks of the 16 inoculations.  - Took nanodrop readings (range varied between 6 ng/ul -45 ng/ul).  - Did an analytical digest with Xba1 using 5 samples of the highest concentrations (2, 4, 10, 14, 17).  - Gel result didn’t show bands for 4, 2, 14, 17, only sample 10 showed visible bands for both cut and uncut.  - Re-inoculated 16 samples from glycerol stocks for 16 hours to for minipreps the following day.  - re-PCRed 6 tubes of MMP-9 with MMP9 4 bb RseFW primes (total of 8 tubes to gel extract and purify the following day).

Xba1 restriction sites in PSBIC3 – 1 restriction site
the recombinant plasmid (with zeocin as an insert) is about 3-6-3.8 kb when cut with Xba1 or EcoR1. Instead the gel run for the xba1 digests have a strong 2 kb band in all the cuts. Possibly, some plasmids may have ligated to themselves.
