Synthetic Biology at UCLA
Synthetic biology is the creation and manipulation of living organisms to accomplish a defined task.  The principles of engineering and biology have converged to form its basis. As a unique and emerging multidisciplinary field, there is incredible scope for education and advancement.
Through a vast field, synthetic biology has taken roots at undergraduate institutions around the world  in the form of a competition: International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM). iGEM offers undergraduates  the opportunity to conduct original research, design new biological systems, and share those results with a  community of schools, laboratories, research institutes, and industries. The iGEM community looks to help in advancing the developing field of synthetic biology with the goal of fostering scientific research and education among undergraduate students.
As members of UCLA's Synthetic Biology Club and iGEM team, we are excited to see where the field of synthetic biology, and the iGEM competition, can take us!
