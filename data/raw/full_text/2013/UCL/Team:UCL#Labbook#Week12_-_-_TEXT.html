Bacterial Lab
Monday 19th August
pSB1C3 streaked plates (well 23.O) were retrieved from 30C incubator. Colony growth visible indicating successful transformation . Colonies were expected to be red in colour, however this was not observed.

A single colony from each plate was then inoculated in LB in order to later prepare glycerol stocks .
iGEM 2012 boxes were searched for pSB1C3 . Transformation was carried out, selective plates were spread, incubated at 37°C overnight.
Inoculations of the following were carried out in 2mL LB:
·IRRE+PC+RBS (pSB1C3) (2x in 2mL LB) -> 2ul and 5ul -> incu-shaker
·RFP+pSB1C3 (scooped from plates) (2x in 2mL LB) -> incu-shaker
1.5mL miniprep, 0.5mL glycerol stock for following day.
Tuesday 20th August
Plates taken from incubation:
Competent cells transformed with plasmid: Colony growth indicating cells have successfully taken up plasmid.
Negative control (only competent cells): Colony growth indicating likely problems with chloramphenicol .
Chloramphenicol will therefore be re-made.

RFP+PSB1C3 -> 4x 200ul glycerols -> glycerol storage at -20°C.
All 4 Falcons were minipreped . Subsequently ran gel showed no bands indicating no DNA presence.

10x chloramphenicol plates were made using supervisor Yanika Borg's chloramphenicol.
Meeting with Dr Darren Nesbeth:
The following Biobricks ordered were brought by our supervisor to be streaked onto the relevant antibiotic plates and inoculated in antibiotic+2mL LB. Incubate at 37°C overnight.

Glycerol stocks were made from the plates that displayed sufficient colony growth.
A second attempt at zeocin PCR was performed using Phusion DNA Polymerase.
1 - Zec bb F, R 2ul
2 - Zec bb F, R 1ul
3 - Zec F, R 2ul
4 - Zec F, R 1ul
5 - Negative control zec bb F, R
6 - Negative control zec F, R
A gel was run with 8ul of each of the 6 reactions. PCR was successful.

(4) PCR purified zeo bb FR + 1ul template
(6) bwf + bb RE + 1ul template
