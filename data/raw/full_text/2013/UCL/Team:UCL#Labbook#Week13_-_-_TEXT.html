A gel was run on 100ul of prep digest K812014 + 20ul dye. 2000bp was scooped in gel extraction .
Chloramphenicol was tested at x2 and x4 concentration with 50ul cells spread on each plate, results from the next day still showed significant colony growth (100+).
Thursday 29th August
Nanodrop of pSB1C3 purified from gel extract, 260/280: -25/21, ng/ul: 13.5
5ul was run on a gel, however extract of pSB1C3 was unsuccessful as no bands were visible.
PCR:
3 PCR reactions of zeocin using zec BB F, R primers were performed. First reaction: 1 ul pSecTag2A template, second 2 ul pSecTag2A and third reaction - negative control - no template.
3 PCR reactions for cmv promoter were prepared using the same variation of template volume as above. These were tested the next day and were successful. Gel photo (30/08).

After overnight incubation, from each of the the 10 ml inoculations of K812014 (I), pSecTag2A and second (different) sample of K812014 (II), 2.5 ml were minipreped while the rest of 7.5 ml from each was used to make glycerol stocks .

A gel was run with the E, P cut  K812014 and the corresponding band of liniarised pSB1C3 (backbone of K812014) was extracted for purification.
Nanodrop of the purified pSB1C3 DNA showed a concentration of 8.4 ng/ul (260/290 = 2.91; 260/230 = 0.02, Absorbance = 7.379) while the nanodrop of the pSB1C3 DNA offered by the postgrads showed 13.01 ng/ul (260/280=1.34).
PCR:
8 new reactions were prepared for zeocin - same primers bb F,R as used previously.
A checking (analytical) gel was performed  revealing no bands for reaction tubes 6 and 7 (each of these with 1 ul template)- PCR unsuccessful.
These amplified zeocin together with the 2 reaction tubes of amplified zeocin f aa cmv  from a day before and a were loaded onto the gel and the bands corresponding to 2 kb were extracted for purification.
Saturday 31st August -
Gel extraction purification of zeocin and cmv. We are expecting that through this procedure the Phusion polymerase, DMSO, buffer, template DNA will be washed away, thus achieving purification of zeocin and cmv DNA (which are to be digested hence, prepared for ligation in the pSB1C3 backbone).
PCR:
Zeocin was amplified again, in 9 tubes (same reaction) -> a total volume of 50 ul x 9 = 450 ul.
Prep digest of zeocin and cmv straight after PCR.

* 0 colonies in plate with 10 ul inoculum spread and 10 colonies for the 90 ul inoculum spread.
After the transformation protocol we spread the transformed cells on 4x cmp (?) agar plates using both 90 ul and 10 ul cell inoculum in the case of cell vials 1,2,6,7 (Yanika’s) and 45 (ours).
We picked 5 colonies from each plated cell vials 28, 45, 51 and 52 (2 ml and 2 ul cmp) and incubated for 10 hours. These inoculations were then used to make glycerol stocks and minipreps.
Gel extraction purification
The 9 tubes of amplified zeocin performed were loaded on a gel and the 2 kb bands were subsequently extracted (6.2 g of gel). This zeocin DNA was purified using gel extraction purification kit and 3 tubes of each 60 ul purified zeocin resulted (labelling zeo g.e.p.).

The 20 inoculations were retrieved from the incu-shaker. All falcons showed growth apart from one inoculation from cell vial 28 (ligation 3:1 zeo).
1.5 ml of each tube was used for miniprep while the other 0.5 ml was used to make glycerol stocks .

These digests were loaded into a gel in the following order: single digest, double digest, uncut. The result of this gel was negative, there were no bands for the loaded DNAs (the 1 kb DNA ladder was on the gel), the procedures of achieving recombinant zeocin and cmv plasmid were unsuccessful.
We suspect that the water was contaminated with nuclease.
