Achievements
Darwin Toolbox
Darwin Toolbox is our first product towards making synthetic biology more accessible. Key design considerations were ease of use and affordability. Our first version contains the core tools for biotechnology. Darwin Toolbox will also effortlessly connect to a computer and synchronise experimental data such as pictures of gel runs, PCR profiles and timestamps. Future iterations of the Darwin Toolbox will include features such as synthetic biology breadboarding and networking to other boxes. Darwin Toolbox will ship with all the necessary accessories, such as pipettes and tubes, as well as a highly curated selection of reagents.
