What were the skies like when you were young?
</P><P class="abstract_text" style="color : #404040;">

They were beautiful, the most beautiful skies as a 
matter of fact. The sunsets were purple and red and 
yellow and on fire, and the clouds would catch the 
colours everywhere.

   The memories of family holidays when you are young are such a mix of emotive events. Stress, arguments, adventure, taking in the wondrous sights of a new place... For me, they are the best of memories, because they distil the essence of what family is and inspire a love for travel.

   This is a photo of me and my grandparents from when I was little. As a child,I used to spend my summer holiday at my grandparents and those moments were the best moments of my life, the single time when I was truly happy day after day. I've never been as happy as then. Certainly I don't want to forget these memories! I want to keep those memories alive as well as my grandfather's image,who passed away a long time ago. Hope I will be able to cherish my childhood memories till my dying day.

There's a cliff thats particularly soft and green.

 Aged 7, around the street there was a dirty greenhouse packed with Cacti in the small concrete front garden. One time, some vandals smashed it, so when my parents weren't looking, I leant over the fence at the maw of the cactus. It looked quite like this.

 My first year in University, I would run out of the halls  and up primrose hill. I had a choice at this stage whether I took the hill steeply or gently, but I was getting a weird mix of runner's high and sleep deprivation. This would be the place I'd aim for.
