WESTMINSTER MODELING COLLABORATION
Another model based on the UCL simulation
Since Westminster's iGEM team had not produced a model of their own, and their project has several similarities to ours, we have constructed an additional model, also in C#, and sent this to Westminster's team for them to use. The model simulates bed bugs moving randomly in a cubic room. One of their proposed "blood traps" is integrated into the simulation, which visually demonstrates bed bugs being attracted and then subsequently killed by the device.
This simulation was written in C#, in a similar manner to UCL's own model. The animation below shows the model operating. Red dots represent bedbugs; as they move to the bottom-left hand corner of the floor, they are killed and removed from the model.
Below this animation are a couple of graphs demonstrating the potential uses of the model. The first shows the approach of a single bedbug to the device; note the random fluctuation in addition to the directional motion. The second graph shows the effect of room size on time taken for all bedbugs to reach the device and die.
