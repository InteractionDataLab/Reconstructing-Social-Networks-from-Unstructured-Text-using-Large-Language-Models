Week 11
Bacterial Lab
Monday 12th August
Chloramphenicol was produced and stored at -20°C.  In order to produce glycerol stocks , pSecTag2A and pSB1C3 were inoculated with LB media in two falcon tubes each (1x drug, 1x no drug), two plates for each plasmid were also streaked (1x drug, 1x no drug). All were left to incubate at 37°C overnight.

This indicated that the pSecTag2A cells are acceptable to use for glycerol stock generation and for plasmid purification. Miniprep was performed on the two incubated Falcon tubes from yesterday.
The results concerning pSB1C3 indicated that the chloramphenicol did not work, and the glycerol stock is dead. Therefore a new glycerol stock was sought after and chloramphenicol was remade.
Ampicillin & chloramphenicol were remade and pSB1C3 was located in the iGEM 2012 distribution kit. Ampicillin & chloramphenicol were both tested by producing 1x positive and 1x negative plate for each antibiotic streaked with W3110 cells. Left to incubate at 37°C overnight.
Glycerol stocks of pSecTag2A was grown, and a miniprep was carried out. PCR could not be carried out as the primers for pSecTag2A had not arrived.
Wednesday 14th August
Two analytical digests of pSecTag2A with EcoR1-HF and Dpn1 were carried out.

Told by supervisor Dr Darren Nesbeth to use a ratio of 3:1 inoculum:80% glycerol when making glycerol stocks.
Darren's instructions:
pSB1C3
Transfer entire glycerol tube contents to 10mL LB ND in a 50mL Falcon & measure OD. Place in 37C shakee overnight. Measure OD next morning. If there is growth in the inoculum use a loop to streak onto chloramphenicol and ND plates again.
pSecTag2A
50ul of 2013 pSecTag2A glycerol stock to inoculate 10mL LB ampicillin in a 50mL Falcon. Grow overnight then generate 15x glycerol stocks in 1.5mL eppendorfs. Store at -20°C.

15x eppendorfs of pSecTag2A ampicillin glycerol stock and 4x eppendorfs of pSB1C3 ND glycerol stock was prepared.
pSB1C3 LB ND was streaked onto two plates (1x Chloramphenicol, 1xND). Incubated at 37°C overnight.  Remaining 2ml of pSB1C3 LB ND (from falcon) is used to purify and conduct an analytical digest (16th August).

iRRE+PC+RBS and PC+RBS (containing pSB1C3 , taken from 2012 iGEM boxes) were plated onto cmp plates. Incubated at 37°C overnight.
Two falcons for each stocks, one containing 5ul and the other 15ul, both were inoculated in 2ml LB+2ml chloramphenicol. Incushaker at 37°C overnight.
Friday 16th August
Falcons were retrieved:

Lanes:

Results from gel: 1kb DNA ladder showed on gel. No bands for EcoR1, Pst1, DD and Uncut plasmid were seen - indicating that no DNA was present -> possibly due to problems with the miniprep .
Therefore from the iGEM 2012 plate 5 (distribution kit) well 23.O, DNA containing BBa_j04450 (colonies are clearly red in colour - RFP) in pSB1C3 was located. The dried DNA was resuspended in 10ul dH2O, left to sit for 5 minutes, then transformed into competent cells -> streaked onto plates and left to incubate at 30°C over the weekend.

HeLa cells have confluency of about 60%. Passaged the HeLa cells and ‘backup’ HeLa cells. We set up two 6-well plates  at 0.25 x 10^6 cells/ml in preparation for Zeocin kill curve. Cell count involved (0.45 cells/ml).
Tuesday 13th August
