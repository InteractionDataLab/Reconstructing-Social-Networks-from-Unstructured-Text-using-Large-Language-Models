The Bacteria Team is living some intense moments! The first transformation of the zeocin ligation took place yesterday and we're all very optimistic! We're about to know the results of this zeocin cloning on the 2nd, the latest the 3rd.

</P><P class="minor_title">2nd September</P><P class="body_text">
We finally received the oligonucleotides needed for the linker region! We can now start the cloning plan for this biobrick.

</P><P class="minor_title">3rd September</P><P class="body_text">
We started to consider which type of poster would be the best for the Jamboree presentation.
We met Darren at 4 pm to discuss about the cloning strategy for MMP9.
</P><P class="minor_title">4th September</P><P class="body_text">
We used SurveryMonkey in order to make a decision on who should present at the Jamboree. 
We reached a consensus for Alex, Tom and Casey to carry out this precious job for the team.
</P><P class="minor_title">5th September</P><P class="body_text">
We decided that the best option as the background colour for the T-shirts would be white.
</P><P class="minor_title">6th September</P><P class="body_text">
HQ replied about zeocin resistance biobrick. It will count as a new part. They also confirmed our attendance to the Regional Jamboree. Lyon, here we come!

Alex produced a first draft of the poster while the other gave him feedback and FYi offered to take care of the actual design.
</P><P class="minor_title">9th September</P><P class="body_text">
Today Darren visited us at the lab and brought us MMP9 which was used to transform our competent cells. 
A new ligation for zeocin was prepared and competent cells were transformed with it.
</P><P class="minor_title">10th September</P><P class="body_text">
All the photos of the team members and supervisors were mounted on wiki.
We had another discussion with Darren who advised us to test again the chloramphenicol and also to prepare more competent cells. He also reminded us to always use pSecTag2A as a positive control when minipreping.
</P><P class="minor_title">11th September</P><P class="body_text">
Intense work in the Bacterial Lab as the Biobrick Submission deadline is nigh. Obtained new stocks of valuable pSB1C3.
</P><P class="body_text">
Weiling sent further sponsorship proposals to GSK and New England Biolabs.
</P><P class="minor_title">12th September</P><P class="body_text">
We agreed on the final details for the T-shirts.
</P><P class="body_text">
Robin released the update on Modelling. Yey!
</P><P class="body_text">
Darren gave us some OneShot Top 10 competent cells from 2004 in order to continue with the transformations.
</P><P class="minor_title">13th September</P><P class="body_text">
Bacterial Lab is experiencing some sparks of success. Possibly the ligated zeocin biobrick was achieved!
</P><P class="minor_title">14th September</P><P class="body_text">
We decided not to use K812014 biobrick anymore because of the inconsistent digestion. We're always obtaining 3 bands instead of 2 when digesting with EcoR1 and Pst1.


</P><P class="minor_title">15th September</P><P class="body_text">
After many minipreps of the stock of 4 transformations and subsequent digestions of these DNAs, we finally identified the ligated zeocin into pSB1C3 (origin, second ligation and transformation set).
</P><P class="minor_title">16th September</P><P class="body_text">
Weiling set ligations of MMP9 in pSB1C3 after pcr-ing it and digesting it with EcoR1, Pst1 and Dpn1.
</P><P class="minor_title">17th September</P><P class="body_text">
Began the narration filming for the documentary. This start happened in the Grant Museum of Zooloy.
</P><P class="minor_title">18th September</P><P class="body_text">
Work is being done on the presentation preparation. A first draft of the powerpoint was produced and people invited to give feedback on it.
</P><P class="minor_title">19th September</P><P class="body_text">
Bacteria Lab worked on maxipreping the recombinant zeocin plamid as well as on the MMP9 recombinant plasmid.
</P><P class="minor_title">20th September</P><P class="body_text">
Today is the deadline for sending our biobrick. Casey prepared for shipping and sent the zeocin biobrick.
</P><P class="minor_title">23rd September</P><P class="body_text">
Narration filming for documentary continued in the UCL campus. 
</P><P class="body_text">
Apart from that, Professor John Powell was very kind to accept to be interviewed by our team.
</P><P class="minor_title">24thSeptember</P><P class="body_text">
Transformation of HeLa cells with the recombinant zeocin plasmid was performed today under the assistance of Alex Kinna. Thanks Alex! 
</P><P class="body_text">
This transformation was proven to be successful!
</P><P class="minor_title">25th September</P><P class="body_text">
The company to print our T-shirts was chosen. We're going with Image Scotland.
</P><P class="minor_title">26th September</P><P class="body_text">
Two representatives of Source Biosciences payed us a visit in the tissue culture lab at 2pm. They discussed transfection methods with us and advertised their reagents.
</P><P class="body_text">
Alex finished the bioinformatics work at Cancer Research UK in the BMM lab. The programme intended to be run with cancer data to produced results for a paper being written in the lab. Alex begins to run the programme with Alzheimer's data to see how our circuit could be improved.
</P><P class="minor_title">27th September</P><P class="body_text">
Darren confirmed with us the funding for the trip to come! Friday, the 11th of October, in the afternoon, we're flying to Lyon!
</P><P class="minor_title">30th September</P><P class="body_text">
The Narration for our documentary was continued with the interview of Professor Patrick Haggard followed by interviewing Professor Stephen Hart. 
</P><P class="body_text">
