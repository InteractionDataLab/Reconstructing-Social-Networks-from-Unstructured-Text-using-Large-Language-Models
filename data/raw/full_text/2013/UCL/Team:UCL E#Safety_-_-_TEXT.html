Biosafety
Although the manipulation of DNA does not involve the use of live organisms, the utmost care must still be taken with all reagents and equipment in order to minimise the risk to the user and avoid any potential damage to the environment. The follow Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) describe the various hazards associated with the reagents used with Darwin Toolbox, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Risk Assessment for use of the different modules within the toolbox can be found.
Technology Misuse
Our project raises concerns that our technology could be used by hostile groups, similar to the iGEM CU Boulder project . All the equipment our laboratory kit provides is already accessible via online retail outlets.
