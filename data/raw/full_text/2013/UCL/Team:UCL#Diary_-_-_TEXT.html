Team:UCL/Diary
From 2013.igem.org
NOTEBOOK
From the time the team first assembled in January 2013 until the mad stressful rush as deadlines loomed, we recorded our daily activities in brief. We chart our iGEM journey from discussing whether or not we could use zebrafish to clean water with DIY synthetic biologists, to uploading the last details of our project to the wiki, and all the socials that spiced things up in between.
LAB BOOK
Magic happens in the lab. Sometimes. The times when it did, and the far more numerous times when it did not, are all recorded here in the lab book, an essential tool for keeping track of our project and looking back at it. From trying to grow competence cells to attempting out first transfection in human microglia.
