The team discussed about the work on zeocin,pA-f1-Zec biobrick, which will indeed be an improvement of BBa_J176124 because:
</P><P class="body_text">
i) it gives most of the functionality of BBa_J176124 but is compatible with standard assembly
</P><P class="body_text">
 ii) it allows people to simply insert a PROMOTER-ORF fragment upstream of a pA to give an expression cassette for the ORF of interest, and a ZEC to select stable transfectants. 
</P><P class="minor_title">9th August</P><P class="body_text">
