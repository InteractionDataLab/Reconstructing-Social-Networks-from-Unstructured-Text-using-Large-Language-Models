Tubes were labelled from 1 to 11. This was unsuccessful.
Made new inoculations from 5X CMP and 1X CMP plates for Ligated CMV-MMP9.
Sunday 29th September
There were not enough colonies for B3&4. The rest of the samples were minipreped and digested and run on a gel cut.
4 more inoculations in 10 ml LB broth of A2, A5, B2 and C2. Nanodrop readings of these inoculations were poor.
Mammalian Labs
Monday 23rd September
Seeded 2x105 cells (1x105 cells/ml) per well into 16 wells set in three 6-well plates. Stock Hela passaged (P21).

Aim: To stably transfect Hela cells with ’’Str Ble’’.
Confluency of dishes: 30-50%
Per well of the 6-well plates: 13 well total.
1.    Mass of DNA: 2.0µg
2.    Volume of DNA dissolved in TE Buffer: 5.0 µl
3.    Final volume of DNA diluted in serum free media: 100 µl
4.    Volume of superfect (SF) reagent:10.0 µl
5.    Volume of serum-containing media: 600 µl
2x ”mock transfected” wells (No DNA, No SE)
Procedure:
Made a ”mask mix” solution for the 13 well-plates to be transfected , with the following composition :
1.    34 ng
2.    93.5 ul
3.    1870 ul
4.    187 ul
5.    11220 ul
Transfer DNA-Buffer solution to 15 ml falcon tube. Add non-serum media (1776.5µl), Filter, Add SF, Vortex (10.6), Incubate for 5-10 min at room temperature. Meanwhile aspirate and wash cells with 4ml PBS. Add media with serum (600ml). Pipette up and down x2. Apply to cells(≈700µl). Incubate for 2-3 hours. Change media. Incubate (24 hours)
Note : for characterisation , add 1µl of 100µg/ml zeocin to one plate, 2µl to another, and 3µl to the last to make up the concentrations to those over the page.
