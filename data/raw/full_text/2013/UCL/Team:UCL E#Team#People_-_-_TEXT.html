Philipp Boeing
I have been involved in iGEM at UCL since 2011. This year, apart from advising our undergraduate team, I wanted to try something new with iGEM E. I'm very interested in DIYbio, citizen science in synthetic biology and the lot - so being involved in Darwin's Toolbox excited me a lot.
Bethan Wolfenden
I am a biochemist by background, and I enjoy combining interdisciplinary science with different audiences. I believe experiential learning is the best way to get to grips with new subjects, particularly important emerging technologies like synthetic biology.
Tom Catling
I'm a PhD student in UCL's Optical Science Lab working on thin mirrors for x-ray telescopes. I enjoy making all sorts of stuff and met the other IGEM E team members through UCL's Institute of Making. Biotech is a really interesting field and I firmly believe in a technically and scientifically literate society, so I thought this project sounded very interesting.
Oliver Coles
I'm a PhD student in astronomical instrumentation, specifically focusing on optics, data analysis and target selection for future spectrographic instruments designed to probe dark energy. As a fan of the open source hardware and maker movement I'm excited to be able to work on a project to enable a wider group of people to have fun with biotech.
Desmond Schofield
I am a EngD student in the Department of Biochemical Engineering at UCL working on the production of a biotherapeutic protein for a novel cancer therapy. I enjoy interdisciplinary work and the application and commercialisation of scientific concepts. I am excited to be involved with Darwin's toolbox as it is a chance to expand the use of synthetic biology into new areas and gives me an opportunity to take a hands-on approach to bringing a technology to market.
Marek Kultys
I am an interdisciplinary product and information designer based in London, UK. In my design practice I collaborate with scientists, engineers, hackers, writers and local activists. User-centred design, visualising information and speculative design are the most common fields of my activity.
I graduated from Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw and Central St Martins College of Art and Design in London. I am also a designer at Science Practice, London.
