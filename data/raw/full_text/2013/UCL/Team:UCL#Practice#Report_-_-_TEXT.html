FEASIBILITY REPORT
A Practical Assessment Of Implementing Our Treatment
We conducted a feasibility report on how likely it is that our remedy would be accepted by the public and government, and the competitiveness of our remedy, in light of recent pharmaceutical failures for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) .
It is clear that a cure for AD is desperately sought after. Using the result of surveys and discussions with medical doctors and carers of patients with AD we concluded that even with the controversy of synthetic biology, if a safe and effective treatment were created, patients, carers, relatives, members of the public would all support our treatment.
Also, we made estimates towards the costs of our proposed treatment and the issues our product has to overcome to be marketable. A high price would mean less people would be able to afford it, however, it is necessary as most innovative technologies start out at a high price but becomes more affordable with time. Furthermore, even at the high price, people would still want to use our treatment (given that it’s proven successful), because no drugs have been deemed cost-effective so far.
The Report
In this report, team member Andy Cheng examines the economic feasibility of distributing  our proposed treatment, looking at resource allocation, the cost of research for AD and the cost-benefit of spending on the ageing population.
