March
Final few meetings were held before exams, both within UCL and at the Arts Catalyst. The most popular projects were brought forward and were narrowed down to the following:
• Anti-cancer yoghurt
• Zebrafish
• Alzheimer's disease
• Neural Network
The team held a probiotic yoghurt workshop for the anti-cancer project. During this opinions regarding the projects were gathered as members of the public were allowed to make their very own yoghurt. Ethical concerns regarding the Alzheimer's project were frequently raised during the workshop. As a result, the team came to the conclusion that bioethics would play a large role within the project.
