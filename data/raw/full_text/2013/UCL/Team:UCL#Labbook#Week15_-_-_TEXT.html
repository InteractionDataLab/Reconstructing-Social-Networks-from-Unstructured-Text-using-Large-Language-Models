These ligation reactions were stored at -20 degrees Celsius and used in the following day for transformation .
Reinoculated K812014 from glycerol stocks in order to increase the stocks of backbone pSB1C3. 15 ml Falcon contained 3 ul cell culture, 3 ml LB broth and 3 ul chloramphenicol (cmp).
These were incubated overnight and then minipreped .

MMP9 in cmv hygro plasmid was used to transform home-made competent cells in order to built a stock.
Colony count - 90% - 100+ and 10% 80 colonies.
Biobricks (K81 and J63) as well as potential recombinant plasmid transformations (transformations of 31 August) were inoculated from glycerol stocks and minipreped in order to achieve a strong stock of pSB1C3 backbone.
The minipreps resulted showed an average concentration of about 30 ng/ul (highest concentrations were found for one of the miniprep of K812014 biobrick - 34.6 ng/ul and for a transformation of cell vial 28: 67.6 ng/ul.
The following day, some of these, showing high concentrations, were E and P analytical digested in 30 ul reaction volumes. The nanodrop result of the MMP9 miniprep was 42 ng/ul with 260/280 = 2.05.

Colonies from plate IX and X were picked and taken through the competent cell test using 250 x (4x) for drug plate.
New inoculations (in 3 ml LB broth and 3 ul cmp) of the transformations from 4/09 and 9/09 (?) using 8 colonies from each of the following plates: 2 z, 5 z, 6 z, 7 z were prepared and left in the incu-shaker in the usual conditions over night.
Transformation number 3:
We transformed 7 homemade competent cells using 5 ul of each of the 7 ligation reactions set on the 9/09 (check date) as well as one more of these cell vials with pSecTag2A plasmid (concentration 30 ng/ul) as another control.
The c3 ligation (1:3) was lost as one of the cell vials containing was taken by mistake by someone from the team.
After the transformation procedures these cells were spread on agar plates containing 2x cmp and 2 x amp for the pSecTag2A biobrick.
On the same day, 10 ul of z2, c4 and pSecTag2A (of potentially transformed cells) was inoculated with 2 ul cmp and 2 ml LB broth.
Wednesday 11th Sepetmber
Re-inoculations of glycerol stocks of biobricks (those in pSB1C3 backbone - J63.. and K81 as well as that in pSecTag2A) and potential recombinant plasmids were made in an attempt to grow the stock of pSB1C3 backbone.   There was no growth for 4 out of the 6 inoculations made for J63 biobrick and also no growth for transformed cells from original vial no. 28.
Labeling of the 8 colony inoculations of each of the potential transformation with potentially recombinant pSB1C3 + zeocin (31 and 4/09 transformations):
Falcon Tube no.

Prep digest of linearised pSB1C3 from the 2013 High school distribution kit with EcoR1 and Pst1 in a 40 ul volume reaction (using 25 ul DNA and 2 ul of each E and P). This was incubated for 2 hours and then freezed. Before it was used in another ligation, it was heat inactivated at 80 degrees Celsius for 20 min).
Analytical digest of zeocin and K812014 biobrick with Stu1 restriction enzyme. Expected bands:  - For zeocin 2 bands: one of 1037 bp and another of 783 bp  - For K812014, 4 bands of 1589 bp, 877 bp, 311 bp and 175 bp

After EcoR1 and Pst1 digestion and running a gel of the potential backbone sources for building up the pSB1C3 stocks we decided to avoid using biobrick K812014 due to the presence of 3 bands instead of 2. Instead we decided to use J632014 biobrick as a pSB1C3 source for now on because it shows the correct number of bands and lengths of the digested DNA material.
Prep digest of pSB1C3 (E, P digested the day before) with Dpn1 – added 2 ul of Dpn1 to the volume of 40 ul of double digested pSB1C3 and incubated it for 1 hour at 37O C. This was done in order to prepare the backbone for ligation. Also, before ligation, the tube was heat inactivated at 80O C for 22 minutes.

** Diluted by adding 4 ul of RO water to 4 ul of DNA T4 ligase from Alex. These were left on the bench for 30 minutes and then heat inactivated for 20 minutes at 80O C.
Transformation 4
Two ul of each of these ligations were used to transform One Shot Top10 Competent Cells (2004) offered by Darren. The specific transformation protocol for this type of cells was followed apart from adjustments on step 8 where after incu-shaking at 225 rpm for one hour, the tubes were pelleted for 2 minutes and the supernatant was temporarily removed from each tube and each pellet was resuspened in 100 ul of the previously removed supernatant. 3 LB agar plates with 5x chloramphenicol were prepared and the 3 transformations were spread on these.

Accomplished tasks asked by Darren:
- Spread straight from the glycerol stock of J632014 on 4 plates (0 x cmp, 2 x cmp, 4 x cmp and 5 x cmp) in order to build up the stocks of pSB1C3 backbone source. There was no growth the following morning.
-  Spread the remainder of transformed cells (12/09): 50 % on 5 x cmp plate while the other half on 2 x cmp. These were pelleted for 4 minutes.
- Plan MMP9 PCR with Taq DNA Polymerase: 2 reactions making use of the 2 types of primers as well as running 2 controls (with no template).
- New transformation using One Shot Top10 Competent Cells. For each ligation type, spread the cells 50% on 1xcmp and the other half on 5xcmp.
Candidate recombinant plasmid (zeo + pSB1C3) analytical single digest with Stu1 (expecting 4 kb band) and BSCr1 (expecting 2 bands: one of 3435 bp and the other of 508 bp) and double digest with EcoR1 and Pst1 (expecting 2 kb band).

The inoculation in 4xcmp from the plate AA1 5xcmp showed a concentration of 40.1 ng/ul and 260/280 coefficient equal to 1.89.
PCR of bb zeocin was set using Taq polymerase to make three 50 ul volume reactions and a control with no pSecTag2A template.
A gel was run to check MMP9 PCR and zeocin PCR from 5/09 samples z1, z2, z5, z7 and control 9. The correct bands appeared apart from z2 and z7 which showed no DNA.
Sunday 15th September
Prepared 9 glycerol stocks from the 9 inoculations made the day before while the rest of each of these inoculations was minipreped .
From the plates of the day before, other 20 colonies from AA1 1xcmp plate (falcons 1.1 – 1.20) and 3 colonies from AA1 5xcmp (falcons 5.1 to 5.3) were picked and inoculated in 4xcmp LB broth.
