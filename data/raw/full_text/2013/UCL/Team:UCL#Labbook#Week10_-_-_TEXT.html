Week 10
Bacterial Lab
Monday 5th August
The new batch of ampicillin was tested via transformation of competent cells with pSecTag2A. Plates were spread and incubated at 37°C overnight.
Tuesday 6th August
Results from 5th August transformation:
Vial
Ampicillin Plate
Plasmid Insertion
Colony Count
1 (Main)
Yes
Yes
100+
2 (Positive Control)
No
Yes
100+
3 (Negative Control)
Yes
No
15
This indicates that there is still an issue with the ampicillin , possibly a problem with the stock powder used. A final test with both old and new ampicillin was carried out and compared without plasmid insertion.
Wednesday 7th August
Vial
Ampicillin Plate
Plasmid Insertion
Colony Count
1 Old Ampicillin
Yes
Yes
100+
2 New Ampicillin v2
No
Yes
100+
3 Positive Control
Yes
No
15
Results indicated that the ampicillin source may not have been fully functional, therefore a new source of ampicillin powder was located and ampicillin was remade.
Thursday 8th August
Preparation of 4x ampicillin plates and 4x no drug plates for storage in the fridge.
Friday 9th August
Meeting with supervisor Dr Darren Nesbeth
Goals to complete for upcoming weeks:
create glycerol stocks of both pSecTag2A and pSB1C3, purify and extract pure DNA for pSecTag2A and pSB1C3.
Mammalian Lab
Tuesday 6th August
Checked HeLa cells. Cells are growing slow, left to grow for a few more days
Thursday 8th August
HeLa cells are about 30% confluent. Changed media.
