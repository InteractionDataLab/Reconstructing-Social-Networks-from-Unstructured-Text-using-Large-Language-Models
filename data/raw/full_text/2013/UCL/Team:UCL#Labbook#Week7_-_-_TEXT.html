Bacterial Lab
Monday 15th July
The team is introduced to the laboratories which will be used during the summer for both bacterial and mammalian experiments.
Tuesday 16th July
5X M9 salts , minimal agar , 1.4% molten agar solution and 0.1M CaCl2/15% glycerol were prepared for the generation of competent cells. Minimal agar plates were poured and streaked with W3110 Escherichia coli cells and left overnight to incubate at 37C.
Wednesday 17th July
Very little colony growth was observed from W3110 ''E.coli'' streaked plates. Plates were therefore left to incubate for a further 17 hours.
Thursday 18th July
Sufficient colony growth allowed for the selection of a single colony from each plate. This was then inoculated in 5ul LB media + 100ul 1M MgSO4 and left to incu-shake overnight at 37C.
Friday 19th July
Cultures re-suspended in new LB media and 100µl aliquots placed into individual eppendorf tubes for placement at -80C.
Mammalian Lab
Wednesday 17th July
Mammalian cell culture and maintenance training by Mrs. Ludmilla Ruban. Passaged primary MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells. Passage 3.
Thursday 18th July
MEF passage 4
Friday 19th July
MEF passage 5
