Week 7
Bacterial Lab
15th July - The team is introduced to the laboratories which will be used during the summer for both bacterial and mammalian experiments.
16th July - 5X M9 salts , minimal agar , 1.4% molten agar solution and 0.1M CaCl2/15% glycerol were prepared for the generation of competent cells. Minimal agar plates were poured and streaked with W3110 Escherichia coli cells and left overnight to incubate at 37C.
17th July - Very little colony growth was observed from W3110 ''E.coli'' streaked plates. Plates were therefore left to incubate for a further 17 hours.
18th July - Sufficient colony growth allowed for the selection of a single colony from each plate. This was then inoculated in 5ul LB media + 100ul 1M MgSO4 and left to incu-shake overnight at 37C.
19th July - Cultures re-suspended in new LB media and 100µl aliquots placed into individual eppendorf tubes for placement at -80C.
Mammalian Lab
17th July - Mammalian cell culture and maintenance training by Mrs. Ludmilla Ruban. Passaged primary MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells. Passage 3.
18th July - MEF passage 4
19th July - MEF passage 5
Week 8
Bacterial Lab
22nd July - Transformation of our competent cells with plasmid YB3110 was carried out.
23rd July - No colony growth was observed on Ampicillin plates indicating no plasmid uptake. transformation was repeated with YB3110.

Week 9
Bacterial Lab
29th July - A glycerol stock of pSecTag2A from 2009 was restored. This was streaked onto 3 plates (2x LB Amp and 1x No drug), additionally four Falcons with 2ul LB were inoculated with the glycerol stock (2x LB No drug, 2X LB Amp). These were left to incubate overnight.
30th July - pSecTag2A Amp and No drug cultures were centrifuged (5 minutes at 4000rpm) and the pellet frozen to be used later in a miniprep . pSecTag2A plates displayed good colony growth. Colonies were picked from non-competent W3110 streaked plates and inoculated in LB ->incu-shake 37C o/n.

This indicated that the cells are more competent than the last batch, although growth on the negative control was a cause for concern. Therefore the transformation protocol from yesterday was repeated to see whether the ampicilin was working -> plates left for incubation 37C o/n.
Transformation of competent cells with pSecTag2A. 100µl was then spread onto 6 plates (4x Amp, 2x No drug). Left to incubate o/n 37C.
2nd August - Plates displayed significant colony growth on amp plates indicating successful transformation . Negative control however displayed slight colony growth - ampicillin not working effectively, new ampicillin was therefore prepared. End of week inventory was recorded and stocks were topped up.

Results indicated that the ampicillin source may not have been fully functional, therefore a new source of amp powder was located and amp was remade.
8th August - Preparation of 4x Amp plates and 4x no drug plates for storage in the fridge.
9th August - Meeting with Darren Nesbeth, requirements for upcoming weeks: create glycerol stocks of both pSecTag2A and pSB1C3, purify and extract pure DNA for pSecTag2A and pSB1C3.
Mammalian Lab
6th August - Checked HeLa cells. Cells are growing slow, left to grow for a few more days
8th August - HeLa cells are about 30% confluent. Changed media.
Week 11
Bacterial Lab
12th August - Chloramphenicol was produced and stored at -20C.  In order to produce glycerol stocks , pSecTag2A and pSB1C3 were inoculated with LB media in two falcon tubes each (1x drug, 1x no drug), two plates for each plasmid were also streaked (1x drug, 1x no drug). All were left to incubate at 37C o/n.

This indicated that the pSecTag2A cells are acceptable to use for glycerol stock generation and also for plasmid purification. Miniprep was performed on the two incubated Falcon tubes from yesterday.
The results concerning pSB1C3 indicated that the chloramphenicol did not work, and the glycerol stock is dead. Therefore a new glycerol stock was sought after and chloramphenicol was remade.  Amp & Cmp were remade and pSB1C3 was located in the 2012 distribution kit. Amp & Cmp were both tested by producing 1x positive and 1x negative plate for each antibiotic streaked with W3110 cells ->left to incubate o/n at 37C. glycerol stocks of pSecTag2A was grown, and a miniprep was carried out. PCR could not be carried out as the primers for pSecTag2A had not arrived.
14th August - Two analytical digests of pSecTag2A with EcoR1-HF and Dpn1 were carried out.

The pSB1C3 glyc stock (from HQ) was from the 2012 iGEM box in MMP -20C
Told to use a ratio of 3:1 inoculum:80% glycerol when making glyc stocks
Darren's instructions:
pSB1C3
Transfer entire glycerol tube contents to 10mL LB ND in a 50mL Falcon & measure OD. Place in 37C shakee overnight. Measure OD next morning. If there is growth in the inoculum use a loop to streak onto cmp and ND plates again.
pSecTag2A
50ul of 2013 pSecTag2A glyc stock to inoculate 10mL LB Amp in a 50mL Falcon. Grow overnight and the next day generate 15x glyc stocks sing 1.5mL eppendorfs -> store in MMP -20C.

Results from gel: 1kb DNA ladder showed on gel. No bands for EcoR1, Pst1, DD and Uncut plasmid were seen - indicating that no DNA was present -> possibly due to problems with the miniprep .
Therefore from the iGEM 2012 plate 5 (distribution kit) well 23.O, DNA containing BBa_j04450 (colonies are clearly red in colour - RFP) in pSB1C3 was located. The dried DNA was resuspended in 10ul dH2O, left to sit for 5 minutes, then transformed into competent cells -> streaked onto plates and left to incubate o/n @30C over the weekend.

A single colony from each plate was then inoculated in LB in order to later prepare glycerol stocks .
iGEM 2012 boxes were searched for pSB1C3 . Transformation was carried out and then selective plates were spread, incubated o/n @37C.
Innoculations of the following were carried out in 2mL LB:
·         IRRE+PC+RBS (pSB1C3) (2x in 2mL LB) -> 2ul and 5ul -> incu-shaker
·         RFP+pSB1C3 (scooped from plates) (2x in 2mL LB) -> incu-shaker
^ 1.5mL miniprep, 0.5mL glycerol stock for following day (20th)
20th August - Plates taken from incubation:
Competent cells transformed with plasmid: Colony growth -> cells have successfully taken up plamid.
Negative control (only competent cells): Colony growth -> Most likely problems with Chloramphenicol .
Will therefore re-make chloramphenicol

A gel was run on 100ul of prep digest K812014 + 20ul dye. 2000bp was scooped in gel extraction .
Chloramphenicol was tested at x2 and x4 concentration with 50ul cells spread on each plate, results from the next day still showed significant colony growth (100+).
29th August - Nanodrop of pSB1C3 purified from gel extract, 260/280: -25/21, ng/ul: 13.5
5ul was run on a gel, however extract of pSB1C3 was unsuccessful as no bands were visible.
PCR:
3 PCR reactions of zeocin using zec BB F, R primers were performed. First reaction: 1 ul pSecTag2A template, second 2 ul pSecTag2A and third reaction - negative control - no template.
3 PCR reactions for cmv promoter were prepared using the same variation of template volume as above. These were tested the next day and were successful. Gel photo (30/08).

A gel was run with the E, P cut  K812014 (Gel photo?) and the corresponding band of liniarised pSB1C3 (backbone of K812014) was extracted for purification.
Nanodrop of the purified pSB1C3 DNA showed a concentration of 8.4 ng/ul (260/290 = 2.91; 260/230 = 0.02, Absorbance = 7.379) while the nanodrop of the pSB1C3 DNA offered by the postgrads showed 13.01 ng/ul (260/280=1.34).
PCR:
8 new reactions were prepared for zeocin - same primers bb F,R as used previously.
A checking (analytical) gel was performed  revealing no bands for reaction tubes 6 and 7 (each of these with 1 ul template)- PCR unsuccessful.
These amplified zeocin together with the 2 reaction tubes of amplified zeocin f aacmv  from a day before and a were loaded onto the gel and the bands corresponding to 2 kb were extracted for purification.
31 August -
Gel extraction purification of zeocin and cmv. We are expecting that through this procedure the Phusion polymerase, DMSO, buffer, template DNA will be washed away, thus achieving purification of zeocin and cmv DNA (which are to be digested hence, prepared for ligation in the pSB1C3 backbone).
PCR:
Zeocin was amplified again, in 9 tubes (same reaction) -> a total volume of 50 ul x 9 = 450 ul.
Prep digest of zeocin and cmv straight after PCR.
