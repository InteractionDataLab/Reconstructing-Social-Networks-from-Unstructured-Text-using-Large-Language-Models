Team:UCL E/templates/fbphotos
From 2013.igem.org
Intro
This is a template page that lists all pictures from a facebook album.
Originally created by Jelmer Cnossen (TU Delft), fixed and extended by Philipp Boeing (UCL)
Necessary addition to your wiki template: - Lightbox (for the slideshow effect, when the user "maximises" one of the pictures) - Either just embed the CSS and JS from the UCL 2012 wiki: <link rel="stylesheet" href=" https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:University_College_London/css/lightbox&action=raw&ctype=text/css " type="text/css" />
and
<script type="text/javascript" src=" https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:University_College_London/js/lightbox&action=raw&ctype=text/js "></script>
or download the files linked in the css, and transplant them into your own namespace, if you feel like it.
