The Art Project
The idea behind the body paint was to combine art and synthetic biology. At first sight these two categories seem to be pretty different, but on second sight we realized that they have more in common than we thought.
Synthetic biology is based on artificial systems. Systems that are able to equip chassis with new features. These features have been defined to resolve problems our society is dealing with. Wether environmental, medical or nutritional issues are concerned; the first step will be to recognize such a problem. You really have to deal with that issue before you can start finding a solution.
On the other hand stands art. A form of expression that allows to criticize in a nonverbal way and that can encourage thinking processes. Art is a medium for social reflexion and offers the possibility to address the general public.
The work in both fields requires creativity, technical skills and a lot of commitment!
