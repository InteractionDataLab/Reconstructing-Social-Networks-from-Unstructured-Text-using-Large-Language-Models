After 2h at 37°C the samples were applied on an agarose gel (1% Agar, 0.5 TAE to 50 ml) to visualize band 3 ul gel red was used. The gel displayed that some colonies showed no additional band and therefore are likely to have the insert included. Those positive minipreps were send to sequencing at GATC.
The sequencing results validated that the insert was successfully cloned into pX334a and therefore pIG9000 was ready for the testing on the ELISA.

Seeding cells for transfection
HEK-293T cells were seeded at a density of 250,000 cells/ml. The conservation culture contained 60,000 cells/ml.
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 % Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin solution (DMEM complete) and incubated in a moisturized atmosphere containing 5 % CO2. Cells were detached with 2.4 ml Trypsin-EDTA solution, transferred into 7 ml fresh medium and centrifuged for 3 min at 900 x g. The supernatant was removed and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 - 7 ml medium. Cell numbers were determined by transferring 100µl cell solution to 10 ml of Casyton Buffer and counted in an Innovatis Casy Cell counter (Casy-Technology, Reutlingen, Germany, model TT). For maintaining cultures, HEK-293T cells were cultivated in petridishes with a starting concentration of 0.6 or 1.2*106 cells in 10 ml medium and incubated as described before.

PEI Transfection and preparation of uniBAss experiment
Seeded cells were transfected with pIG9000 following the protocol.
Cells were transfected using the PEI transfection method with the following concentrations: Typically for a 200µl transfection mix, 1.5µg of DNA and 5µl PEI (Polysciences, Inc., PA, cat. no. 23966) were filled up with OptiMEM (Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany cat. no. 11058-021) to 100µl. Afterwards, the 100µl PEI solution was added to the 100µl DNA solution, vortexed and incubated at RT for 15 to 30 min. Afterwards 200µl of the PEI / DNA transfection mix was added drop-wise to each 1 ml culture medium containing cells in well plates and incubated at 37°C, 5 % CO2. After 5 h, the medium was exchanged , Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 % Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin solution (DMEM complete)
The ELISA plates (Corning, Inc., cat. no. 3590, NY, New York) were coated with 100µl streptavidin solution (20µl / 10 ml in dH20 to obtain a final concentration of 4µg/ml) and incubated overnight at 4°C.
24.05.13
uniBAss experiment to observe the influence of different Ion concentrations
The streptavidin coated plates were washed 3 x with TBST (TBS, 2 ml / l Tween20) and 300µl blocking buffer (1 x TBST, 1 % BSA) was added for 1 h. After 3 x washing with TBST, the biotinylated oligonucleotides (10pmol/well) were applied and incubated at RT for 1 h. Afterwards the plates were washed 3 x with TBST.  To obtain the cell lysate with the Cas9 protein, the transfected HEK-293T cells (250,000 cells / ml) were resuspended in 250µl dilution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl) containing EDTA free Protease inhibitor per 125,000 cells / ml and sonified for 10 min. To remove the cell fractions the lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500xg.
To adjust the buffer condition a dilution row with cell lysate comprising the Cas9 were performed in round 96-well plates. The dilution buffers used were b1 (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 10 mM MgCl2, 250 mM NaCl) and b2 (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl) respectively.  This resulted in the following conditions.

Afterwards 100µl of the diluted cell lysate was transferred to the ELISA plates. After 1 h incubation at RT the plates were washed 3 x with TBST and 100µl anti-HA antibody solution (1000 x diluted in blocking buffer) was applied to each wells and incubated for 1 h. After 3 x washing with TBST, 100µl anti-mouse HRP antibody (4000 x diluted in blocking buffer,) were added. After 1 h incubation, plates were washed 3 x with TBST, probed with 100µl ELISA ABTS substrate and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. For the positive controls, wells were coated with 100µl FM protein (1.0 µg / ml) and directly with the sonificated cell lysate in the dilution buffer. The negative controls performed were composed of, no Antibody, no oligonucleotide at all, not the matching oligonucleotide sequence.
in the following this protocol was always used only variations are mentioned.

Binding restrain of the Cas9 MX1 crRNA complex for bisected buffer
To check if the Cas9 protein was in the cell lysate a western blot was performed
For specific detection of proteins, semi-dry Western Blots were performed. The polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF) (0.45 µm, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, cat. no. T831.1) was first activated in methanol then washed with dH2O and subsequently equilibrated in the transfer buffer. For Semi-dry transfer of proteins, a sandwich of Whatman paper / gel / membrane / Whatman paper (wetted with the transfer buffer) is placed directly between cathode and anode in a blotting chamber (Peqlab, Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany cat. no. 52-2020). The blot was performed at 450 mA for 1 h. To prevent unspecific binding of antibodies, the membrane was incubated in block ing solution (2 % milk in PBST) at room temperature for 1 h at shaking conditions. Afterwards, the membrane was incubated in PBST 1 % milk supplemented with the primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Followed by washing the membrane 3 x with PBST for 15 min, the membrane was incubated with PBST 1 % milk containing a horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After 3 x washing with PBST for 10 - 15 min, the blot was incubated with 1 ml Western Blotting Detection Solution and detection of the chemiluminescence, emanating from the HRP-mediated conversion of the substrate was performed in an image reader .

Testing of different dCas9 fusion proteins in the optimized buffer condition.
The tested constructs can be divided into two groups. The Cas9 fusion constructs Cas9 - VP16, Cas9 - KRAB and the Cas9 with one active nickase domain and with two nickase domains. The composition of this experiment aimed to examine whether all constructs are expressed in the same pace and display the same binding behavior.
The ELISA was performed as explained. The ELISA indicated that the fusion constructs are 3 - fold less expressed than the constructs with the Cas9 only. The comparison between a Cas9 completely lacking the nickase activity and a Cas9 having one active nickase shows no significant difference. However the yield of the Cas9 construct without any nicking activity is slightly higher. A Bradford assay was used to adjust the FM protein concentration for the standard. The FM protein was coated in a 1 : 1 dilution row for 1 h at RT in duplicates onto the ELISA plate. The transfected HEK–293T cells were harvested using the optimized dilution buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 90 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) containing EDTA free Protease inhibitor.
The four different biotinylated and annealed oligonucleotides (oIG9004 / oIG9005, oIG9012 / oIG9013, oIG9041 / oIG9042 and oIG9015 / oIG9016 (10 pmol / well) were coated by incubation at RT for 1 h. After 24 h transfected HEK-293T cells were resuspended in the optimized buffer condition and the binding affinity of the different Cas9 / crRNA construct was analysed during an ELISA. A quantification of the different Cas9 constructs was performed by using a standard dilution row with FM protein. a) Concentration of the undiluted Cas9 constructs. The figure shows the different quantities of different Cas9 constructs as well as the disparity of undiluted sample compared to diluted samples. Error bars represent the standard deviation of 3 replicas.

30.08.13
Picking colonies and minipreps
colonies for all truncations were picked and inoculated for mini-prepping in liquid cultures. Mini preps were not successful because cultures were too thin. more colonies were streaked out on agar plates to grow over night.
31.08.13
Mini Preps and test digest of standardized truncations
four colonies of each T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 were preped with Roche kit and eluted in 50 µl H2O.

02.09.13
Sequencing
Midi preps of standarized truncations 1-5 were sent for sequencing with CMV forward primer @ GATC or oIG6018.
Cells seeded for ELISA
65,000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates as transfection will only be on wednesday (04.09.).
03.09.13
Sequencing results and cell harvesting
All sequencing results were useless (sequence length 0nt). Therefore no western blot was done today but cell pellets were collected and frozen. wells transfected with fluorescent proteins were photographed (link pics..). For harvesting cells were washed with cold PBS and then rinsed from well bottom with 500 µl cold PBS and collected in 1.5ml Eppis. Samples were centrifuged 5min at full speed (21000xg), supernatant was decanted and cell pellets were frozen at -20°C.
pIG9200 and mini T1-1 (pIG9201) were sent for sequencing again with CMV-F and BGH-R (both @ GATC).
04.09.13
Western blot
still no sequencing results. pellets blotted anyway. sample buffer, sonifyer, SDS PAGE, semidry blot (not enough transfer buffer?? gels dried out), block in TBST+milk 1h30, anti-HA-mouse 1:2500 in TBST+milk over night.
GATC is repeating seuquencing of pIG9200 and pIG9201 with oIG6017.
retrafo and new minis (in 1.5ml eppis) of T1-5? Natalie.

05-07.09-13
Sequencing results
sequencing did not work because no CMV promoter in construct! finally sequenced with oIG6017: result: SV40(!)-NLS-Cas-BGH, no CMV promoter and no HA-tag! Therefore all our truncation constructs are useless. We have to wait for the standardized CMV-HA-NLS-Cas9-BGH construct.
09.09.13
Cloning of CMV-HA-NLS-Cas9-BGH
We received HA-NLS-Cas9-BGH from standardization group and have to ligate it with the CMV promoter.
Mini prepping and test digest
some colonies were prepped and test-digested with NgoMIV or NotI.(Natalie)
Mini1 (407ng/µl) was used for digest.
Digestion with EcoRI/XbaI and EcoRI/SpeI
HA-NLS-Cas9-BGH is cut open with EcoRI-HF and XbaI, the CMV promoter (pIG0019, 5ng/µl) is cut out with EcoRI-HF and SpeI-HF to then be ligated into the opened Cas9-backbone.

no CMV promoter...
12-18.09.13
New cloning strategy with new CMV promoter
Ligations done again to produce SV40-HA-NLS-dCas9-NLS-BGH (pIG0063) and CMV-HA-NLS-dCas9-NLS-BGH (pIG0062). Both used as templates for truncation PCRs. Only CMV constructs shall be tested at first, as we expect higher expression (and thus more easily detectable binding levels in uniBAss) here.
19-20.09.13
Sequencing of truncation minis
Minis for each truncation with CMV promoter were sent for sequencing, had to be repeated for T1,2,4 and 5 due to frameshifts/extra primer insertions etc.. Wait for results on Monday, but inoculate midis anyway on Sunday.
22.09.13
Seeding cells
Four 6-well plates were seeded with 130,000cells/ml=260,000cells/well.
Midis inoculated
Midis of T1-T5 were inoculated (except for T3, already done by Michi and Nadine). Gabi :)
23.09.13
Midis and transfection of CMV-T1-5
Finally sequencing results were correct (T4 was repeated:check tomorrow), inoculated midis were prepped with Promega kit (double buffer amounts) and eluted in 600µl nuclease free H2O.
Transfection was performed as on plan in 6-well plates. Additionally all standardized constructs (CMV and SV40) and their non-standardized pX334a-versions were transfected to be compared on uniBAss. The Assay will be performed 48h after transfection. change of media required? check in the morning!
Transfection scheme for uniBAss ELISA experiment
24.09.13
No medium change of the cells transfected the day before was performed. SDS-Gel for the westernblot which will be performed tomorrow poured. The ELISA plate for uniBAss is coated with streptadivin.
25.09.13
uniBAss ELISA
The HEK-293T cells were lysed about 42h after transfection. The uniBAss ELISA was performed according to the protocol. In parallel a westernblot was performed with 2/5 of the lysate of each well to ensure dCas9 expression.
25.09.13
Westernblot of uniBAss probes
The westernblot of yesterday was analyzed. Due to problems with resolving the protein pellet we had suboptimal results in the blot.
Therefore we want to repeat the hole experiment. As two days before we transfected HEK-293T cells in 6-wells: transfection scheme . This time we made biological duplicates for the standardised constructs. (together six 6-wells)
26.09.13
Medium of the six 6 wells was exchanged 12h after transfection.
27.09.13
Westernblot of 2. uniBAss probes
As an expression control we wanted to perform the westernbot of the transfected cells this time before we to the uniBAss ELISA. So we collected the cells in 500µl diluent buffer and took 170µl for western blotting. The 170µl cell suspension was centrifuged for 5min at 10,000xg, the supernatant decanted and the pellet resuspended in 100µl SDS-sample buffer. Then the suspension was sonified for a total of 35min. The probes were cooked for 15min and SDS-page was performed, followed by a semidry westernblot. After blocking, the primary antibody (mouse-anti-HA) was applied over night.
28.09.13
Development of the westernblot. After washing and applying the secondary antibody we developed the membranes.
We could detect most of our constructs and had very nice bands. So we want to perform the uniBAss with all our probes tomorrow, therefore we coated an ELISA plate with streptavidin.
29.09.13
uniBAss ELISA V
To perform the uniBAss we had to unfreeze our probes from the -80°C freezer. Then we sonified them and proceeded with our usual uniBAss-protocol.  Except for the constructs containing a CAG promoter all constructs are standardized and in pSB1C3. CMV-GFP serves as a negative control as it contains no dCas9 (and thus no HA-tag), CMV-dCas9 neg contains no RNAimer plasmid and also should not be able to bind the EMX1 oligo. As a control for specificity of the binding we coated one well for each construct without any oligo and an additional well with a VEGF oligo that is not complementary to the EMX1 target site on the RNAimer that was co-transfected with all dCas9-constructs.
We received lower ABTS readouts for our dCas9 fusion constructs than for the dCas9 alone. But is due to significant weaker expression of the fusion-constructs. Therefore we normalized the values of the ABTS readout in the ELISA to the dCas9 amount with the help of the westernblot of the respective contructs. We substracted the no oligo values and then set the dCas9 alone to 100% expression.For the dCas9-VP16 construct we received a value of 25,6% expression after analysis with imageJ. For dCas9-KRAB 5,4% and for dCas9-G9a 53,7%.  Errorbars show the standard deviation of two technical replicates.
uniBAss ELISA results 29.09.13.
Again only the non-standardized constructs show an ABTS signal, meaning that no dCas9 binding is detected in our standardized pSB1C3 constructs. This is probably due to the low expression of CMV-dCas9 and SV40-dCas9 we observed in the western blot which might not be sufficient to be detected with uniBAss. For the other oligo control we see strange off target effects that are probably due to a technical mistake. Maybe our BSA batch is not working properly as we get too high values for unspecific binding. The results show non the less that there is no binding detected for negative controls lacking dCas9 or the RNAimer plasmid.
After evaluating the results of the assay we desided to repeat the experiment one more time. Next time we will try to use more cell lysate to get higher amounts of dCas9 protein so that effects for the dCas9 in pSB1C3 can be seen in uniBAss. Therefore four 6-well plates HEK-293T cells are seeded which will be transfected tomorrow. We will try the following changes in our uniBAss protocol:
Transfection in duplicates to gain more volume of lysate
take up cells in 100-200µl dilution buffer per 6-well to obtain higher dCas9 concentration in lysates
sonify cells for 10min
centrifuge lysate before applying it to the 96-well ELISA plate to get rid of cell debris
increase oligo concentration when coating the wells
try a different off-target oligo from AG Weber
30.09.13
Transfection
This time we transfected only the standardized constructs but in biological duplicate to have enough cell lysate for uniBAss. Ilona did the transfection of the four 6-well plates.
October
01.10.13
New 10xTBS was made and the uniBAss ELISA plate was coated with streptavidin.
02.10.13
last but not least uniBAss
Today we performed the last trial to get results with uniBAss with the standardized constructs before the Jamboree in Lyon.
The ELISA plate well were blocked and coated with oligos (EMX1, other oligo from AG Weber, no oligo). Then wells were blocked again with blocking buffer containing new BSA (Sigma). Cells were scraped off in 160µl dilution buffer (also with new BSA) per 6-well, sonified for 10min at 4°C and centrifuged 5min at 500xg. 100µl of lysate was applied to each well and incubated for more than 1h. Afterwards the standard protocol was followed.
All efforts taken to upconcentrate the amount of dCas9 in pSB1C3 were not enough to see an effect in uniBAss. Due to a lack of time we will not repeat the uniBAss again.
06.10.13
Seeding of cells for functional test of all truncations
2 24-well plates were seeded with 65,000 cells per well.
07.10.13
Transfection
One plate was transfected with a reporter plasmid containing SEAP under the control of a CMVmin promoter, differnently truncated dCas9-VP16 constructs   and two RNA plasmids (activation via VP16); the other with a reporter plasmid containing SEAP under the control of a SV40 promoter, differnently   truncated dCas9 constructs and two RNA plasmids (repression via CRISPRi).
40 µl Opti-MEM + 0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
Addition of 2.25 µl PEI-solution, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for at least 15 min at RT.
Solution was spread drop-wise to the cells in the dish
Ratio of DNA amount (mass):
reporter plasmid (SEAP) : effector plasmid (Cas9) : RNA plasmid
1 : 4 : 4
Additionally a plasmid coding for Renilla luciferase was cotransfected (5 % of DNA amount)
08.10.13
Medium change
Medium was changed after 12 h.
09.10.13
Medium removal
Supernatant was collected for SEAP measurement 36 h after transfection for repression and 46 h after transfection for activation.
Cells of repression were frozen at - 80 °C for later on Renilla measurement.
SEAP measurement of repression
Collected supernatant and fresh cell culture medium was heated at 65 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 1250 g for 1 min.
Supernatant was diluted in cell culture medium 1:5 and 1:10.
80 µl of (diluted) supernatant was applied to 100 µl of SEAP buffer.
After addition of 20 µl pNPP (substrate of SEAP) the absorbance of the mix was measured every minute for 2 h at 405 nm.
SEAP measurement of activation
Collected supernatant and fresh cell culture medium was heated at 65 °C for 30 min.
80 µl of supernatant was applied to 100 µl of SEAP buffer.
After addition of 20 µl pNPP (substrate of SEAP) the absorbance of the mix was measured every minute for 2 h at 405 nm.
Cell lysis for lyciferase measurement
250 µl of lysis buffer (containing Tris-HCl, EGTA, MgSO4, DTT and protease inhibitor) were applied to the (thawn) cells of each well.
Incubation on ice for at least 10 min.
Centrifugation at 2,200 g for 15 min.
Luciferase luminescence measurement
80 µl of supernatant were pipetted in a white 96 well plate.
Measurement of luminescence (every 2 min for 15 min) immediately after addition of 20 µl Renilla substrate in PBS.
Results of activation via VP16
Truncation clearly activated SEAP expression, but afterwards sequencing revealed that the truncation did not work. So T4 is actually the same as the   positive control.
Results of repression via CRISPRi
After normalization to Renilla expression the positive and the negative controls had almost the same values. So there can not be drawn a validated   conclusion from this experiment. Nevertheless it is conspicuous that the SEAP level of truncation 4 is clearly below the ones of 2, 3 and 5.
10.10.13
Digestion of uniCAS Truncation 4 with EcoRI and AgeI. Simultaneous digestion of G9a, Krab, KrabKrab, VP16, VP32, VP64 in RFC25 standard with NgoMIV and SpeI. Additionally, digestion of the BgH terminator in RFC10 with XbaI and EcoRI. Subsequent ligation of three fragments each. uniCas Truncation 4 and BgH terminator fragments were the same for all plasmids, whereby only the effector domains were exchanged among the constructs to-be cloned.
14.10.13
Striking out of four colonies per attempt: uniCAS T4-VP16, uniCAS T4-VP32, uniCAS T4-VP64, uniCAS T4-Krab, uniCAS T4-KrabKrab and uniCAS T4-G9a.
15.10.13
Miniprep of clones. Testdigest with NotI. All constructs have shown positive digest results, except for uniCAS T4-VP32.
Roth 1kb marker, T4 (neg. control), T4-VP16, T4-VP64, T4-VP64, T4-Krab, T4-KrabKrab, T4-G9a, Roth 1kb marker
After NotI digestion, a ~ 600 bp band, indicating the CMV promoter became recognizable for all obtained vectors. Moreover, according to the size of the upper band, it was also obvious to detect size differences among constructs such as VP16 and VP64.
16.10.13
Seeding of cells for functional test of truncation 4
2 24-well plates were seeded with 65,000 cells per well.

40 µl Opti-MEM + 0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
Addition of 2.25 µl PEI-solution, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for at least 15 min at RT.

Cells of repression were frozen at - 80 °C for later on Renilla measurement.
20.10.13
SEAP Assay
Results of SEAP activation via uniCAS truncation No. 4 with VP16 and VP64 effectors. An activation by the truncated constructs could not be observed - as obvious by comparing the positive control (left) with any of the vectors.
Results of SEAP repression via uniCAS truncation No. 4 with G9a and Krab effectors. Strongfold downregulation could be observed in most cases. However, as off-target repression only occurs, it can be assumed that the repressive effect does not emerge from the domains or locus-specific binding.
