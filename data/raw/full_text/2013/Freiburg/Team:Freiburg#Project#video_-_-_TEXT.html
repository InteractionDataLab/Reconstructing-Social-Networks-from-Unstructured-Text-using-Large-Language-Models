Why don't YOU take our CRISPR Kit?
Enjoy our music video describing everyday labwork, our project and our team!

The Video Weekend
When you’re making a video you realize just how much work you can put into things other than labwork. For a whole weekend we transformed our lab into a film studio! Max put great effort into writing our lyrics and planning film and audio recordings. We were greatly supported by the Medienzentrum Freiburg who provided us with excellent equipment and our fabulous camera & post production team who knew how to use it.
The team was kept busy with hair & makeup, rehearsing the lyrics, serving tea in cooking pots and making the lab look like a real film studio. In shooting breaks we found time to play music, do (some) experiments and discover several acting talents among our teammates!
Especially we had great fun shooting the time-lapse scenes explaining the CRISPR/Cas mechanism of our toolkit in a rather unorthodox way.
The Soundtrack
For professionally recording the CRISPR Song soundtrack we spent one extremely entertaining afternoon at the Medienzentrum. From opera singing to rapping everything was covered. We are eagerly waiting for the final cut that will include all video footage and sound files. Until then please enjoy the current 1.0 version by following the links atop of this page!
Lyrics: „Permanently Singing our CRISPR Song“
This morning I wake up in our lab - a pipet in my hands,
Hoping only that my little HEK cells haven‘t died.
The incubator was not nice to me,
Temperature‘s down to 25 degrees -
It seems that today I can hardly do transfections.
Let's have a look at sequencing results - they must be great, yes.
My motivation‘s far from the end and the data got sent.
But when I opened up the file, my friend -
Mr. Frameshift laughed at me and told me then:
„Baby, you should better stop performing Gibson Cloning!“
Why don‘t you take our CRISPR Kit ?
Activation and Repression with Cas9 on stimulus!
Your genes need a refreshment now,
Get ready for Team Freiburg‘s great fantastic show (WOW).
Our cloning methods failed so long,
But we‘ll stay optimistic and know that it won‘t go wrong.
This is how we struggle on,
Permanently singing our CRISPR song (3x)
Yesterday I worked till past 3 ` in the morning,
Picking clones from plate to plate and striking them out on more plates
I don‘t wanna live that way,
DNA extractions make me faint.
Listening to my advisors curse,
and suddenly we see that someone else has
f****ing published first!
Why don‘t you take our CRISPR Kit?
Activation and Repression with Cas9 on stimulus!
Your genes need a refreshment now,
Get ready for Team Freiburg‘s great fantastic show (WOW).
Our cloning methods failed so long,
But we‘ll stay optimistic and know that it won‘t go wrong.
This is how we struggle on,
Permanently singing our CRISPR song (2x)
Damnit: My extraction failed
Damnit: Got no money left
Damnit: Contamination here
Damnit: Mutations everywhere
