Art & Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is based on artificial systems. Systems that are able to equip chassis with new features. These features have been defined to resolve problems our society is dealing with. Wether environmental, medical or nutritional issues are concerned; the first step will be to recognize such a problem. You really have to deal with that issue before you can start finding a solution.
On the other hand stands art. A form of expression that allows to criticize in a nonverbal way and that can encourage thinking processes. Art is a medium for social reflexion and offers the possibility to address the general public.
The Photo Project - DNA Bodypaint
The idea behind the body paint was to combine art and synthetic biology. At first sight these two categories seem to be pretty different, but on second sight we realized that they have more in common than we thought. The work in both fields requires creativity, technical skills and a lot of commitment! Especially in concerncs of safety and ethics it's important to explain challenges and benefits of Synthetic Bilogy. Art is a medium for social reflexion and offers the possibility to address the general public.
Why don't YOU take our CRISPR kit? - Song & Video Shoot
Enjoy our music video describing everyday labwork, our project and our team!

The Video Weekend
When you’re making a video you realize just how much work you can put into things other than labwork. For a whole weekend we transformed our lab into a film studio! Max put great effort into writing our lyrics and planning film and audio recordings. We were greatly supported by the Medienzentrum Freiburg who provided us with excellent equipment and our fabulous camera & post production team who knew how to use it.
The team was kept busy with hair & makeup, rehearsing the lyrics, serving tea in cooking pots and making the lab look like a real film studio. In shooting breaks we found time to play music, do (some) experiments and discover several acting talents among our teammates!
Especially we had great fun shooting the time-lapse scenes explaining the CRISPR/Cas mechanism of our toolkit in a rather unorthodox way.
The Soundtrack
For professionally recording the CRISPR Song soundtrack we spent one extremely entertaining afternoon at the Medienzentrum. From opera singing to rapping everything was covered. We are eagerly waiting for the final cut that will include all video footage and sound files. Until then please enjoy the current 1.0 version by following the links atop of this page!
Lyrics: „Permanently Singing our CRISPR Song“
This morning I wake up in our lab - a pipet in my hands,
Hoping only that my little HEK cells haven‘t died.
The incubator was not nice to me,
Temperature‘s down to 25 degrees -
It seems that today I can hardly do transfections.
Let's have a look at sequencing results - they must be great, yes.
My motivation‘s far from the end and the data got sent.
But when I opened up the file, my friend -
Mr. Frameshift laughed at me and told me then:
„Baby, you should better stop performing Gibson Cloning!“
Chorus
Why don‘t you take our CRISPR Kit ?
Activation and Repression with Cas9 on stimulus!
Your genes need a refreshment now,
Get ready for Team Freiburg‘s great fantastic show (WOW).
Yesterday I worked till past 3 ` in the morning,
Picking clones from plate to plate and striking them out on more plates
I don‘t wanna live that way,
DNA extractions make me faint.
Listening to my advisors curse,
and suddenly we see that someone else has
f****ing published first!
Chorus
Why don‘t you take our CRISPR Kit?
Activation and Repression with Cas9 on stimulus!
Your genes need a refreshment now,
Get ready for Team Freiburg‘s great fantastic show (WOW).
Why don‘t you take our CRISPR Kit?
Activation and Repression with Cas9 on stimulus!
Your genes need a refreshment now,
Get ready for Team Freiburg‘s great fantastic show (WOW).
