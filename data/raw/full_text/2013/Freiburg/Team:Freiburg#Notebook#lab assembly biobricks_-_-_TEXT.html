Theoretical cloning
Cas9 primers were design to exchange several bases - all as silent mutations – in order to remove all restriction recognition sides of the iGEM enzymes EcoI, NotI, XbaI, NgoMIV, SpeI, PstI, AgeI. Then the standardized Cas9 was brought into pSB1C3 (RFC25) and was used for fusion with with other parts.
