Evaluation of pIG2004 sequencing results (No. 5 and 6)
H840A mutation was inserted in both cases, leading to catalytic inactivation of Cas9
a 300 bp gap was inserted within the CAG promoter, probably due to error-prone PCR amplification
Very GC-rich part on pIG2004 template (part of the CAG promoter lacks nearly 300 bp after having been amplified via PCR and subsequently Gibson-assembled.

Evaluation of transformation results
Except for pIG2020, colonies were grown in each case
6 colonies of pIG2011, pIG2013, pIG2015, pIG2017 and pIG2019 were respectively striked out
All attempts had to be repeated at least twice, as BbsI digestion often lead to unspecific digestion of direct-repeats next to crRNA insertion spacer.

Within the second attempt, DNA was not adequately treated during isopropanol treatment (has to be shaken).
25.-27. June
Test of Cas9-KRAB on Western Blots
Cas9-KRAB and dCas9, both targetting the CMV promoter were respectively co-transfected to HEK 293 cells with another plasmid, encoding CMV driven CNK.
Both attempts were performed repeatedly, and cell lyses were than to be performed 12, 18, 36 and 42 hours post-transfection.
Transfections were performed with PEI
Lyses were performed with modified RIPA buffer
Biological double attempts were respectively done

We expected a stronger decrease in CNK levels, when combining it with Cas9-KRAB than with dCas9
Cas9-KRAB was able to highly efficiently repress CMV driven CNK expression
Cas9-KRAB was expressed.
