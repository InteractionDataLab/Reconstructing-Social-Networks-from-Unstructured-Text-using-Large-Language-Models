</P><P> 
Via the uniCAS Binding Assay we are able to examine the DNA binding capacity of different <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/effector">dCas9 fusion proteins</A>. Thus uniBAss can be used to quantify the amount of HA-tagged DNA binding dCas9 and therefore helps us to characterize our constructs. Not only the dCas9-constructs can be investigated by the uniBAss but also every other DNA binding protein.

HEK-293T cells were either transfected in 6-well plates with dCas9 encoding an EMX1 crRNA on the same plasmid or co-transfected with dCas9 fusion constructs and the EMX1 RNAimer plasmid. Lysates were split and analyzed on uniBAss and western blot 42 h after transfection. The uniBAss ABTS readout seen above is normalized to dCas9 expression levels that were western blot quantified using ImageJ.

Development of uniBAss

uniBAss Introduction
</P></DIV><P> The need to characterize the properties of CRISPR/Cas is motivated by several means. Different fusion constructs have been built based on the CRISPR/Cas system, but it remained unclear if the binding characteristics of dCas9 fusion proteins differ from the native Cas9. 
Simulating complex gene circuits in-silico generates new needs for straight forward characterization of the binding affinity followed by quantification. By this mean information can be gathered about a variety of promoters for different dCas9 fusion constructs. Different assays have been developed to characterize protein-DNA interplay to analyze their respective binding behavior <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(1)"> [1]</A></SPAN>. Examples of these protein characterization assays are the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and the DNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). Both systems have individual strength as well as limitations. ChIP can be used to quantify a sample when coupled with qPCR analysis. However ChIP is limited by the absence of high throughput possibilities <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(2)"> [2]</A></SPAN>. EMSA is able to detect low abundance DNA binding proteins from lysate with a high sensitivity but it is difficult to quantify a sample <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(3)"> [3]</A></SPAN>. However, those assays do not address the need to analyze the binding of a protein to its respective DNA sequence and thus perform a quantification with high capabilities. Starting from these needs a new assay for the biochemical characterization of dCas9 had to be established with the requirements of binding capacity test and quantification with high throughput capabilities. Therefore we developed our Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) uniBAss.
The assay is based on a streptavidin-biotin interaction <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(4)"> [4]</A></SPAN> with the 5’ biotin tag of the oligonucleotide <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(5)"> [5]</A></SPAN>. This was used to immobilize the target DNA.</P><P id="h3">
Optimization
</P><P>To obtain robust conditions for uniBAss, several experiments were performed. Different salt concentrations as well as different oligonucleotide lengths were examined to optimize this assay. Hereafter different dCas9 fusion proteins were tested regarding their DNA binding capacity. In addition Cas9 versions with one nickase domain and without a nickase domain were compared to investigate the influence of the nicking enzyme towards the binding behavior. 
Subsequently to the optimization process the resulting buffer condition 10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 90 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> containing EDTA free Protease inhibitor was used to test different dCas9 fusion constructs.
</P><P>
To assess the influence of different salt compositions in the dilution buffer HEK-293T cells were transfected with a nickase Cas9 version containing a crRNA locus for EMX1. 24h after transfection the cells were taken up in standard dilution buffer b0 (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 10 mM MgCl<SUB>2</SUB>, 10 mM NaCl) and sonified. After that lysate dilutions with <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Notebook/method#firstuniBAss">different MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> and NaCl concentrations</A> were prepared in 96-well plates and analyzed via ELISA. Figure 2 and 3 show that the binding behaviour of the dCas9 / crRNA EMX1 strongly depends on the salt concentrations.

The experiment (figure 3) showed that the nickase Cas9 with EMX1 crRNA sequence acts differently for different buffer conditions. Therefore an optimization process was performed focusing on two main points. Firstly, different salt concentrations illustrate one parameter for optimization. Secondly, the length of the target oligonucleotides coated onto the ELISA plate was taken into account for characterization.
</P><P>Different spacer length flanking the site targeted by Cas9 were designed to investigate differences in binding affinity of the Cas9/crRNA complex to its target (see figure 4). Sequences of all oligos can be found in our <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/plasmids">plasmids and oligo list</A>. The sequences flanking the human EMX1 locus <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(1)"> [6]</A></SPAN> were used to vary the lengths of the oligonucleotides.

Annealed EMX1 oligonucleotides of varying lengths were coated on ELISA plate, transfection and uniBAss were performed as described <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/protocols#uniBAss">here</A>. A more robust binding of the nickase Cas9/EMX1 crRNA complex was achieved with longer oligonucleotide versions. Error bars represent three technical replicates, negative control: no oligo coated.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></CENTER><P>
Using different oligonucleotide lengths to determine the best size of the coated oligonucleotides revealed that the presence of a longer sequence at the 5’ end with about 11 nucleotides consisting of the crRNA locus is essential to get the nickase Cas9 to bind. The presence of a second long sequence at the 3’ end of the crRNA however is not essential for simple binding assays but enables a more robust binding environment. Biotinylated oligonucleotides for prospective assays were designed analogue to the longest oligonucleotides used in the attempt to offer a point of interaction for fusion proteins. 
</P><P>The second parameter focused on optimizing the buffer conditions. The used buffer is composed of 10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA and varying concentrations of MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> and NaCl. The salt concentrations were varied against each other generating 16 different buffers. </P><P id="h4">
Factorial design
</P><P>
The second part of the optimization was done using a factorial design. This approach was used to test whether the MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentration is linearly linked to the ABTS conversion. 
Therefore different concentrations of MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> – 30 mM, 20 mM, 10 mM and 5 mM – and of NaCl – 150 mM, 120 mM, 90 mM and 60 mM, were varied against each other. Indicating that for high MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations the binding of dCas9 is close to zero (Figure 6). Whereas with descending MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations more dCas9 is able to bind to the oligonucleotides, indicating an increase in an exponential matter. This is true for all the tested NaCl concentrations however it is to mention that 150 mM NaCl has the lowest bound nickase Cas9.

After 24 h transfected HEK-293T cells (pIG9000) were taken up in dilution buffer b0 and the salt concentrations were adjusted individually resulting in the conditions (10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, NaCl – 150 mM, 120 mM, 90 mM and 60 mM, MgCl2 – 30 mM, 20 mM, 10 mM and 5 mM respectively). The binding behaviour of the Cas9/crRNA towards EMX1 display similar behaviour for descending MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations.

</P><P id="h4">
Use of factorial design 
</P><P>
To test if the experimentally obtained curves can be fitted to an exponential increase within decreasing MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentration a factorial design approach was performed (see table 1). To check if the conditions either behave in a linear or a non-linear way the experimental b0 values were compared to the calculated b0 values resulting from a central point. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. It was oberserved that the amount of bound dCas9 increases with a reduction of the MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentration.

The results are sorted, from the highest difference (top) to the lowest difference (bottom). The lower the difference the more linear is the area surrounding the central point. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></CENTER><P>
The plotting of the data in two dimensions indicated that there is an exponential increase of the ABTS conversion with descending MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations. To verify this, a factorial design with different MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations was performed within a range of 30 mM and 5 mM MgCl<SUB>2</SUB>. After having the data illustrated in three dimensions (figure 7), it occurred that the decreasing amounts of NaCl also contribute to an increasing yield.

Subsequently to the optimization process the resulting buffer condition 10 mM Tris, 1 % BSA, 90 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 containing EDTA free Protease inhibitor was used to test different dCas9 fusion constructs.

Test of a fusion-construct
</P><P>
After having optimized the buffer conditions for the nickase Cas9 our dCas9–fusion proteins were studied aiming on two points. First to gather information about the target site for the CRISPR/Cas system in a straight forward manner and secondly to study which of the high yield buffer conditions displays the most robust readout when used with various dCas9–fusion proteins. The <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/effector#activation">dCas9-VP16 fusion construct for gene activation</A> was tested on different target on the human VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) gene.
</P><CENTER><DIV><TABLE class="imgtxt" width="800px"><TBODY><TR><TD><B>Figure 8: Three different VEGF biotinylated oligos were used as targets for dCas9-VP16 constructs containing the respective crRNA</B>
The three different biotinylated and annealed oligonucleotides oIG9012/oIG9013, oIG9041/oIG9042 and oIG9015/oIG9016 (10 pmol/well) were coated by incubation at RT for 1 h. After 24 h transfected HEK-293T cells (dCas9-VP16 with VEGF locus 1, 2 or 3) were resuspended in dilution buffer b0 and subsequently the salt concentration was adjusted. The binding affinity of the dCas9–VP16/crRNA complex was analyzed during an ELISA. For different crRNAs the binding affinities seems to differ. This effect could however also be due to differential dCas9-VP16 from plasmids containing different VEGF crRNA loci. The best binding condition was obtained with 5 mM MgCl<SUB>2</SUB> and 90 mM NaCl. Error bars represent three technical replicates, negative control: no oligo coated.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></CENTER><P>
Figure 8 shows the dCas9-VP16 fusion proteins containing different crRNA targeting VEGF loci. This experiment aimed to examine whether there are different affinities between the different crRNAs. It can be seen, that the VEGF loci 1 and 3 behave similar, whereas the locus 2 reveals a higher ABTS readout in uniBAss. This indicates a higher binding affinity of the dCas9-VP16 construct to the VEGF locus 2 oligo but could also result from differential dCas9-VP16 expression levels from plasmids containing different VEGF crRNA loci. To compensate discrepancies in expression level a quantitative western blot could be performed.</P><P id="h4">
Quantification of dCas9
</P><P>
To be able to quantify the amount of dCas9 binding to the oligos in the uniBAss ELISA a purified HA-tagged protein (FM) was used. As the ng/ml concentration of this protein is known, a dilution row was performed to obtain a standard curve and equation to convert the ABTS readout in ng/ml of bound HA-tagged protein. Figure 9 depicts the ng/ml of Cas9 or the different dCas9 constructs calculated via the formula (see figure 9) of the standard dilution curve. Additionally to dCas9-VP16 dCas9-KRAB was also tested. </P><CENTER><DIV><TABLE class="imgtxt" width="800px"><TBODY><TR><TD><B>Figure 9: Quantification of different Cas9 and dCas9 constructs</B>
HEK-293T cells were transfected with the following constructs: nickase Cas9 with EMX1, dCas9 with EMX1, dCas9-KRAB with EMX1, dCas9-VP16 with VEGF2 and analyzed on uniBAss (standard protocol). Error bars represent three technical replicates, (-)cont no oligo coated, off target non EMX1 related oligo coated. ABTS readout was converted into ng/ml Cas9 by using the formula of an HA-tagged FM protein <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Notebook/method#standardcurve">standard curve</A>.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></CENTER><P>
The uniBAss ELISA performed for figure 9 indicated that the fusion constructs are 3-fold less expressed than the constructs with the Cas9 or dCas9 only. The comparison between a dCas9 completely lacking the nickase activity and a Cas9 having one active nickase shows no significant difference. However the yield of the dCas9 construct without any nicking activity is slightly higher.

Find your perfect crRNA

As a part of our toolkit uniBAss is the perfect method to test different crRNA loci. Our experiments showed that not all crRNA sequences result in a similar efficiency of activation or repression of the desired locus. Here uniBAss can be used to test the binding affinity of the dCas9-fusion construct to a large amount of possible crRNAs for a desired gene locus at one. Hence uniBAss offers the possibility for a high throughput analysis of suitable crRNAs to use the unicast toolkit for every gene of personal desire.

High throughput on a microfluidic chip
</P><P>
To expand the high throughput feature of uniBAss from a 96-well plate to much more and faster analysis of crRNAs and samples a microfluidic chip could be used. By using an approach similar to the micro ELISA described by Ohashi T et al. <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(7)"> [7]</A></SPAN> for Cas9-crRNA-DNA interaction it would be possible minimize the time for the analysis (20 times faster!) as well as the sample values (10 times less!). Therefore further work will optimize the uniBAss on a micro-fluidic chip device to save time and money for future iGEM teams when they are assessing the perfect crRNA target on the gene they want to regulate.

Test any DNA binding protein
</P><P>
On top, uniBAss can not only be used to characterize and analyze the DNA binding protein of our toolkit but also by all iGEM teams to assess the DNA binding capacity of their own DNA binding protein. uniBAss is the universal applicable method to test a huge variety of DNA binding proteins, such as TALEN and Zinc-finger. This helps all iGEM teams testing the functionality and DNA binding affinity of their DNA binding protein.

To put it in a nutshell 
</P><P>
Team Freiburg 2013 developed and optimized uniBAss as a universally applicable tool for all iGEM teams not only to test Cas9-fusion constructs of our toolkit and assess the perfect crRNA for their gene locus of desire, but also to examine the DNA binding affinity of any DNA binding protein they wish in a fast, easy and robust assay.
