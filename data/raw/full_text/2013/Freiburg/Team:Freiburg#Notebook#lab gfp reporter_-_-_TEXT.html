expected length of the fragments: 1. CMV: 685bp 2. eGFP: 824bp 3.terminator: 350bp 4.CFP: 820bp bands were not expactly running as expected, but perhaps due to the marker. the marker bands are not separated clearly. So the bands were cut out and gel ex was performed. Nanodropping after the Gel ex: 1. CMV: 156ng/µl 2. eGFP: 143ng/µl 3. terminator: 163ng/µl 4. CFP: 85ng/µl

the testdigest showd as expected 3 bands (896bp, 389bp ans 2517bp) Bands of clone 8 seemed to be right and we sent it for sequenzing (primer: 17, 18)
12.6.13
Sequnecing of clone 8 containing CFP were unclear. to test if the two plasmid are functional they were transfected into CHO cells. therefore 750ng DNA of each mini-prep were transfected per well in a 48 well plate.
13.6.13
In parallel to the transfection test a testdigest of piG6000 and piG6001 was performed.

clone 3 and 4 of piG6000 run as expected and they also show strong fluorescence in the CHO cells. Clone c,d,e and f of piG6001 run higher as expected but they do not show visible flourescence (this might be due to transfecting a mini-prep instead of a midi-prep) Clone 3 of piG6000 and clone e of piG6001 were sequenced
18.13
sequencing results of both constructs are positive.

CMV min
Idea: making pIG6000 able to be activated by Cas9-VP16. therefore the constitutively active CMV promoter is exchanged by a CMV min. oligos will be designed to target PsB1C3 ao that VP16 can activate the minimal promoter and the cells start to show green fluorescence.

Bands were as expected:
pIG6000: 631bp and 3154bp. here the higher band was cut out as it is the vector
pIGPanne: 109bo and 2683bp. here the lower, smaler band was cut out as it is the CMVmin prompter. Gel ex was performed
