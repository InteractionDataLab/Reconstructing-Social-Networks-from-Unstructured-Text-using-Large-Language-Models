Abstract
Our Team developed a universal toolkit,  termed uniCAS, that enables customizable gene          regulation in mammalian cells.  Therefore, we engineered the recently understood and highly promising        CRISPR/Cas9 system.
The regulation is based on the RNA-guided dCas9 protein, which allows specific targeting of DNA sequences.        Our toolkit comprises not only a standardized dCas9 protein,  but also different effector domains for        efficient gene activation or repression.
