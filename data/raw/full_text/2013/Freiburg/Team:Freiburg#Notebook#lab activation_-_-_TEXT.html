SEAP Assay
SEAP is a secreted form of embryonic alkaline phosphatase and thus can be easily detected in a sample of culture medium without destroying the cells and time-consuming sample preparation. SEAP catalyzes the hydrolysis of pNitrophenyl phosphate producing a yellow end product that can be read spectrophotometrically at 405 nm.

10. September
Midiprep
Plasmids were prepped with the Midiprep kit of Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Seeding of cells
4 24-well plates were seeded with 65,000 cells per well
11. September
Transfection
40 µl Opti-MEM + 2.25 µl PEI-solution were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were prepaired in another Eppi .
Addition of the DNA to former Eppi, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for 15 min at RT
Solution was spread drop-wise to the cells in the dish
Medium change
Medium was changed after 5 h.
13. September
Preparation for analyses
Supernatant was collected for SEAP measurement.
Cells were frozen at - 80 °C for later on Western blot and luminescence measurement.
14. September
SEAP measurement
Collected supernatant and fresh cell culture medium was heated at 65 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 1250 g for 1 min.
Supernatant was diluted in cell culture medium 1:4 (25 µl supernatant + 75 µl medium).
80 µl of diluted supernatant was given to 100 µl of SEAP buffer.
After addition of 20 µl pNPP (substrate of SEAP) the absorbance of the mix was measured every minute for 2 h at 405 nm.
16. September
Cell lysis
250 µl of lysis buffer (containing Tris-HCl, EGTA, MgSO4, DTT and protease inhibitor) were applied to the thawn cells of each well.
Incubation on ice for 10 min.
Centrifugation at 15,000 g for 4 min.
Renilla luminescence measurement
80 µl of supernatant were pipetted in a white 96 well plate.
Measurement of luminescence (every 2 min for 30 min) immediately after addition of 20 µl Renilla substrate in PBS.
SEAP activity normalized to Renilla expression
The value of TetR-VP16 is 64,6 which is too high to be shown.
The different SEAP plasmids showed very differing background levels of SEAP expression. When Cas9-VP16 without a crRNA was cotransfected there was a reduction of SEAP expression in two cases, whereas in all other samples the SEAP level stayed unaltered. An activation in SEAP expression in comparison to the cells that were not transfected with Cas9-VP16 was only detectable for the EMX1 target sequence (5 fold).
SEAP activation with TetR-VP16 was much stronger, most probably because there are 13 binding sites for TetR-VP16, but only one for Cas9-VP16.
17. September
Protein precipitation
As the cell lysis needed to be done with a high amount of lysis buffer, proteins are too much diluted for western blotting. Thus, they were precipitated:
The remaining lysates of the triplikates (~ 80 µl) were put together in a new epi.
Addition of TCA to a final concentration of 10 % and 1 µg BSA.
Incubation for 30 min on ice.

40 µl Opti-MEM + 2.25 µl PEI-solution were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were prepaired in another Eppi .
Addition of the DNA to former Eppi, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for 15 min at RT

1 : 4 : 4
Medium change

22. September
Medium removal

Cells were frozen at - 80 °C for later on Western blotting.
Preparation for SEAP measurement
Collected supernatant and fresh cell culture medium was heated at 65 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 1250 g for 1 min.
23. September
SEAP measurement
Supernatant of wells containing CMV:SEAP was diluted in cell culture medium 1:10 (10 µl supernatant + 90 µl medium).
80 µl of (diluted) supernatant was given to 100 µl of SEAP buffer.
After addition of 20 µl pNPP (substrate of SEAP) the absorbance of the mix was measured every minute for 2 h at 405 nm.
SEAP activity [U/L]
pKM600: Cas9-VP16 (not in iGEM standard); PhyB: negative control; all other Cas9 constucts are in iGEM standard (with the indicated promoter); bars represent three biological copies when there is an error bar (mean with standard deviation) or one when there is not.
In comparison to the negative control the non standardized constructs repress the SEAP expression only slightly, whereas there is a strong repression by the standardized constructs, when driven by a CMV promoter. The repression of Cas9-KRAB seems to be a little stronger than the effect of Cas9 alone. But just like in the last experiment, the repression of Cas9-KRAB with a wrong crRNA is as strong as the repression with the right one. In comparison to the negative control there was a reduction in SEAP expression when Cas-VP16 was cotransfected.
Seeding of cells
4 24-well plates were seeded with 65,000 cells per well
24. September
Repeat of seeding of cells
4 24-well plates were seeded with 65,000 cells per well again, as the cell density of the first seeding was too low.
25. September
Transfection
40 µl Opti-MEM + 0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
Addition of 2.25 µl PEI-solution, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for at least 15 min at RT
Solution was spread drop-wise to the cells in the dish
Ratio of DNA amount (mass):

Cells were frozen at - 80 °C for later on Western blotting.
28.09.13
SEAP measurement
Collected supernatant and fresh cell culture medium was heated at 65 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 1250 g for 1 min.
Supernatant of wells containing CMV:SEAP was diluted in cell culture medium 1:15 (6.7 µl supernatant + 93.3 µl medium).

SEAP-Assay: Results
All different tested loci could activate the SEAP-gene expression. Cas-VP16 under the control of the CMV promotor as well as the SV40 promotor worked fine. Using more than one target locus simultaniously increases gene activation.
29.09.13
Protein precipitation
As the cell lysis needed to be done with a high amount of lysis buffer, proteins are too much diluted for western blotting. Thus, they were precipitated:
340 µl of acetone was added to 85 µl of the remaining lysates of one well per triplicate.
Incubation at - 20 °C for 1:15 h.
Centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 g and 4 °C.
Removal of acetone and air drying for 5 min.
Addition of 25 µl 2x SDS-loading dye.
Heating at 95 °C for 5 min.
SDS-gel run
SDS-gel was loaded with 20 µl of each sample. A voltage of 80 V was applied untill the loading dye bands reached the border between collection and separation gel, then the voltage was increased to 120 V.
Western Blotting
Activation of PVDF-membrane for 10 min in methanol.
Short incubation of Whatman papers and the PVDF-membrane in transfer buffer.
Loading of western blot apperature: (-) - Whatman paper - SDS-gel - PVDF-membrane - Whatman paper - (+).
200 mA were applied for 1.5 h.
Antibody treatment I
Incubation of PVDF membrane in blocking buffer (4 % milkpowder in TBS-T) for 1 h.
Incubation with anti HA antibody (in 2 % milkpowder in TBS-T) over night at 4 °C.
3 x washing with TBS-T for 5 min, each.
Incubation with anti mouse antibody for 1 h.
4 x washing with TBS-T for 10 min, each.
Measurement of luminescence after addition of ECL I + ECL II solution.
Air drying of the membrane for further antibody treatments.
Western blot of the SEAP assay from 28.09.
Western blotting did not work well. Maybe lysis due to relative long incubation time on Renilla lysis buffer destroyed cells to much beforehand. So maybe only degradation products are visible.
