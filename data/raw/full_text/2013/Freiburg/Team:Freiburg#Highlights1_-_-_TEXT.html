HIGHLIGHTS
6 opportunities with our uniCAS toolkit
We provide 3 different effectors, 2 methods & 1 effector controller! Using our toolkit it's possible to efficiently activate or repress genes. We also provide devices for effector controling by light. Use our custom-tailored Manual Tool to generate your individual manual for your needs of gene regulation. Further it's possible to target not only one, but multiple genes of interest! And we established uniBAss - our universal Binding Assay. Best of all: It's open source and in iGEM standard!
