pIG7005_2, all clones of pIG7006 and pIG7007_1 & 3 showed the expected bands. pIG7005_2, pIG7006_1 and pIG7007_3 were send in for sequencing.
16.08.13
Midiprep
Though the sequencing did not have a result, plasmids were amplified and midiprepped by Pure Yield Plasmid Midiprep System from Promega because of the results of the test digest.
Seeding of cells for microscopy
A 24 well plate with cover slips was filled with 50,000 cells per well.
17.08.13
Transfection
Protocol:
40 µl Opti-MEM + 1.5 µl PEI-solution were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
0.5 µg of the DNA of interest were prepaired in another Eppi .
Addition of the DNA to former Eppi, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for 15 min at RT
Solution was spread drop-wise to the cells in the dish
Transfection scheme:
18.08.13
Fixation
Cells were washed with 500 µl PBS per well and fixated with 200 µl PFA per well (incubation on ice for 45 min).
Cover slips were washed in dH2O and mounted on a drop of Mowiol with DABCO on a object slide.
19.08.13
Flourescence microscopy
GFP and mCherry were expressed in all cells, only in the cells with TetR-VP16 there was a stronger signal. BFP was not detectable because of the microscope.
21.08.13
Seeding of cells for microscopy
A 24 well plate with cover slips was filled with 50,000 CHO cells per well.
22.08.13
Transfection
Protocol:
40 µl Opti-MEM + 2.25 µl PEI-solution were mixed in a 1.5 ml Eppi.
0.75 µg of the DNA of interest were prepaired in another Eppi .
Addition of the DNA to former Eppi, vortexing for 10 s and incubation for 15 min at RT
Solution was spread drop-wise to the cells in the dish
Medium change
Medium was changed after 3 h.
23.08.13
Fixation
Cells were washed with 500 µl PBS per well and fixated with 200 µl PFA per well (incubation on ice for 45 min).
Cover slips were washed in dH2O and mounted on a drop of Mowiol with DABCO on a object slide.
25.08.13
Flourescence microscopy
GFP and mCherry were detectable, but no differences in fluorescence intensity.
31.08.13
Seeding of cells for flow cytometry
A 24 well plate  was filled with 50,000 HEK cells per well.
