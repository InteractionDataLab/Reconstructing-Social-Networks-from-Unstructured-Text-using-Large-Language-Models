To the ethical and societal relevance of synthetic biology </P><P><FONT size="5">W</FONT>e, the iGEM-Team of Freiburg, participated at an international ethical seminar about synthetic biology at the <A id="link" href="http://www.igm.uni-freiburg.de/"> Department of History and Ethics of Medicine</A> of the University of Freiburg. We wanted to learn more about synthetic biology from a different point of view. From the perspectives of ethics, law, biosafety and biosecurity synthetic biology appeared in an interesting new light. Due to the lectures our understanding of the appearance of synthetic biology in the society, the hopes and fears, grew tremendously. 

The seminar was the last session in a variety of meetings during 3 years of an interdisciplinary project work. All meetings were gathered in the project with the topic <A id="link" href="http://www.engineeringlife.de/"> Engineering Life: An interdisciplinary approach to the ethics of Synthetic Biology</A>. Here, scientists of different institutions investigated in the field of synthetic biology with the aim to clarify
</P><OL style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><LI> if it is justified to speak about creating life, </LI><LI> how the reproach against science to &quot;play God&quot; could theologically be interpreted,</LI><LI> how risks and chances of this field of research shall be analyzed,</LI><LI> if the legal regulations were appropriate, </LI><LI> how a clear definition can be found whether a construct is natural or synthetic, </LI><LI> if there is a divergence in the systematical conditioning and actual research in synthetic biology. </LI></OL><P>
On 26/9/13 it was discussed how a future society based on biotechnology could look like. 
Therefore, several movies from the <A id="link" href="http://bio-fiction.com/en/?lang=de"> Bio-Fiction film festival </A> in Vienna  were shown, where artists and filmmakers should visualize their associations with synthetic biology. 

Here, the panel discussion came to the result that many of the movies showed the chances but also the risks of synthetic biology. Some aspects of mythology reappeared in the movies e.g. breathe life into a <A id="link" href="http://vimeo.com/channels/biofiction/22116707"> golem </A> or opening <A id="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box"> Pandora's box</A>. 

In general, the risks always seemed to have a stronger effect on the audience than the benefits had. Furthermore, synthetic biology seemed to be connected with some kind of industrialization and a symbiosis of nature and technology. Regarding biosafety and biosecurity issues any genetic exchange between synthetic organisms and natural organisms should be prevented. Scientists support a clear separation of those, so that several approaches have been made. Here, xenobiological ideas e.g.  alternative sugar-backbones <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(1)"> [1] </A></SPAN> or chlorouracil <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(2)"> [2] </A></SPAN> in the structure of D(X)NA are worthwhile to mention. 
</P><P>
The next day, on 27/9/13, genetically engineered machines were in the focus of the curriculum. During the discussion catchwords such as &quot;living machines&quot; or &quot;creating life&quot; arose which led to the question if mankind was simply imitating God or if creation was no divine prerogative anymore. 
With these questions in mind the discussion went into a direction, where the role and the character of human beings were exposed in the light of synthetic biology. It was realized that within synthetic biology <I>homo faber</I>, a human that changes and modifies his environment, evolved to <I>homo creator</I>, a human that recreates his environment anew. With well-known literature at the back of their minds <SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(3)"> [3] </A></SPAN> the participants came to the result that synthetic biologists were still normal members of our society and their engineered machines not comparable to God's creation. 
</P><P>
Despite, this led automatically to the question if we would be in need of new laws and limits in order to safe the original environment and to beware the society of a next generation of bioweapons. This was also the main topic of the last day of the seminar on 28/9/13. 
Here, the panel discussion showed that differences in e.g. european and US-law make it difficult to assure the safety of the environment. Therefore, it was suggested that a global gremium should adjust international laws concerning biotechnology and synthetic biology. This reminded us of the <A id="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology"> dual-use </A> debates following a moratorium of several scientists who were working with so called <A id="link" href="http://www.erasmusmc.nl/research/nieuws/2011/2011-11/vogelgriep.gevaarlijk.mensenviru/?lang=en"> superviruses </A>in 2012. During this debate <A id="link" href="http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/medizin/biosicherheit-kuenstlicher-viren-wir-muessen-die-risiken-aushalten-11653765.html"> Global Health Security Policy Board </A> additionaly to the <A id="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSABB"> NSABB </A> was recommended by several scientists and scholars. </P><P>
Hence, a debate about <A id="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIYbio"> Do-it-yourself biology </A> and so called biohackers was initiated. Thus, the defintions of biosafety and biosecurity were elaborated referring to Kelle: </P><P><I>&quot;While biosafety measures aim to prevent the unintentional exposure to pathogens and toxins, or their accidental release, biosecurity
measures focus on the prevention of theft, misuse, or intentional release
of pathogens and toxins</I><SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(4)"> [4] </A></SPAN>.&quot;
</P>
The participants of the seminar submitted that biohackers as amateur biologists wouldn't represent any prior hazard to biosecurity since the access to laboratory devices is still expensive and difficult and the know-how not assesable enough. Further, it was considered that biohackers would risk their own health while working in inappropriate locations as private appartments and with low-budget or self-made devices<SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(5)"> [compare to 5]</A></SPAN>. Thus, biohackers were categorized to biosafety affairs. 
However, bioweapons, bioterrorism and other criminal organizations came in the focus of the talks. 
<P><A id="link" href="https://igem.org/Main_Page"> iGEM </A> was also mentioned several times during the whole seminar. It was described as a competition for young scientists where they can make their first experiences with the synthesis of systems and tools that shall facilitate the daily lab routine of synthetic biologists<SPAN id="refer"><A href="#(6)"> [compare to 6]</A></SPAN>. As our team participated on this seminar, we took the chance and presented our project in a poster session. Philosophers, theologists, bioethicists and scientists were interested in our presentation and asked completely different questions to our project. Interestingly, most of them knew CRISPR/Cas and other systems for gene regulation. Their questions were e.g. </P><OL style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><LI> if we were able to regulate <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Highlights"> endogenous genes </A>,</LI><LI> if we had implemented our uniCas-toolkit into a stable cell line or into a model organism as <I>mus musculus</I>,</LI><LI> if we had any idea to increase biosafety or biosecurity concerning our project?</LI></OL><P>
Here, we could indicate on our <A id="link" href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Safety/safety_forms"> safety forms  </A> and explain our thoughts about risks and chances of a standardized uniCAS toolkit. 
</P>
The seminar has clarified that synthetic biology as a young science causes lots of discussion and connects great hopes but still some fear in regard to biohackers and bioweapons. 
On one side the attitude of society to preserve the natural and on the other hand societal expectations to create something synthetic to protect the natural are forming a tension. This causes us to rethink. Thus, the mutual exchange expanded the horizons of the participants. 

In the end of the seminar, we saw iGEM and our human practice efforts from a different angle. We were aware of the duty as synthetic biologists to demystify our science and laboratory work and to explain it to the society.
