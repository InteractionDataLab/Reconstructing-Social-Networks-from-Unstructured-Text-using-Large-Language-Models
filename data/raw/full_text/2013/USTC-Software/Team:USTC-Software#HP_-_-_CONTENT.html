We would like to say “hi” for iGEM to every teacher and student in USTC and also bring their “ Hello ” to iGEM.
At first, we found that there were few people knowing iGEM in our school, thus we wanted to attract more students to get to know this competition and join iGEM. 
In the preparation stage, we made lots of pretty bookmarks and cute badges with the introduction of iGEM and our team logo. We decided to do human practice on both east and west campus in two days’s time. 
It was an afternoon in early autumn and we were excited about doing human practice today. This activity would be held in front of the dining hall.After being Asked about questions of iGEM, people could be familiar with the competition as well as synthetic</P><P align="justify"> biology. Bookmarks, badges and Coca Cola would be the prizes  and it turned out that Cola in tins were most attractive. More and more people came towards us to answer questions and most of them were curious about iGEM. We were busy introducing this competition to them and meanwhile giving out the bookmarks to passersby. Many people were eager to know more about how to sign up for this competition. Additionally, we were also asked by our schoolmates about what abilities they should have to attend iGEM. Even little children got interested in iGEM and tried to read our poster.</P><P align="justify">Next day, human practice was held at a square in the east campus. More people came to this activity today. We were surrounded by crowds of people and occupied with questions about iGEM and its schedule. Surprisingly, a girl from high school could correctly tell us the exact meaning of synthetic biology. Looking at this lively scene, we felt proud of our activity and our team as well. At last, participants won their prizes and left us their “ Hello, iGEM ” videos.</P><P align="justify">We were happy that we sent out these presents and many people finally got to know iGEM. What’s more, We hope that there would be more people who are interested in synthetic biology and programming joining in iGEM through our human practice</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
