Chenkun Wang is a senior undergraduate majoring in condensed matter physics. As a team leader of USTC-Software, he participated in nearly every part of project. He not only accomplished the basic construction of software, but also was responsible for the development of starter module as well as the database fetching coding. What's more, he completed the GUI of our software with the help of Shuai Ma.
After nearly half year's working for the competition of iGEM_2013_Software, he became overwhelming interested in command line and simulation. He will graduate next year and he hopes to continue such work in his future studies. His dream is to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="members"><DIV class="words"><P><B>Name</B>: Jinyang Li  (李进阳）<B>Age</B>: 21               <B>Major</B>: Theoretical Physics<B>Grade</B>: Junior Undergraduate<B>Division of labor</B>: Software coding, design<B>Email</B>: jinyangustc@gmail.com<B>Brief Intro:</B>

   Hello,I am Shaohua Chen ,an undergraduate in USTC. Before joining in 2013 USTC-Software ,I knew little about the Internet.To change this bad situation ,I was determined to join in USTC-Software where I could not only learn Internet but also know more biology.So  it's an honour for me to cooperate  with many gifted and responsible teammates ,from whom I learned a lot. In the team , I am in charge of the wiki,during the process ,I find that a person's ability is limited,teamwork makes our work more efficient.
