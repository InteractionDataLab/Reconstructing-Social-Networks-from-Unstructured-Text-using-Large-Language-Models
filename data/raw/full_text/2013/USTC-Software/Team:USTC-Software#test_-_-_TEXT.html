This is a simple sliding image with caption. You can have more than one caption and decide the layout of the caption via css.
Here you can see two captions.
The first is loaded immediately before than the second one
You can also get the same effect as the caption with:
A button
Or two buttons
Or any other html element...
and you can decide the transition time of any slide
You can also display videos, but it requires a "fake image"... read the documentation please
You can display any html element directly in the slider, but pay attention, with many elements the transition effect could be slowed.
In this case you can see a Vimeo video and a price table

Introduction
Hi there. First of all excuse me for my bad english, second excuse me if you will find some bugs in Diapo slideshow.
Diapo slideshow is an open source project. You can suggest changes or improvements if you want. You can download it and use for free, you can also include it in your projects and sell it as part of a bigger work (in this case please consider a donation).
Diapo slideshow is tested on new browsers, but I tried to make it compatible with the old versions of Internet Explorer too (8 and 7). But I don't think I will spend many hours to improve this feature, sorry.
Diapo slideshow requires jQuery 1.4+ and other jQuery plugins are necessary if you want to use some functionalities: jQuery Easing ( http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ ), jQuery HoverIntent ( http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html ), jQuery Mobile ( http://jquerymobile.com/ , but not all the plugins). These plugins are included in the zip you can download at the bottom of this page.
Diapo slideshow is the first jQuery plugin I develop from scratch and I distribute for free, so please be lenient
