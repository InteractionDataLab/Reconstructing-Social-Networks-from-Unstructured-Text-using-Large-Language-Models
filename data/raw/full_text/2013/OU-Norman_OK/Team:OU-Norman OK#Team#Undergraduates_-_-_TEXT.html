The Webmaster: Zachariah Herron
Zachariah volunteered to work under the Captain when presented the opportunity and now fills the roles of primary programmer, lab minion, and multimedia coordinator.  His primary field of study is chemistry, but he rarely turns down new skills and thus works in an amateur capacity until he is either knighted or conquers an alien race. His dreams lie amongst the stars and he hopes to one day leave the planet and solar system for far off places. In the meantime, there is science to do and books to read.
