These are the records of the Surely Awesome Research of Students team. They have experienced many a trial and tribulation and quite a few harrowing adventures in the name of Science and Free Food. We believe that they were once human beings, but then something happened along the way and now they are cleverly disguised androids that do indeed dream of good grades and possibly free time... or at least they were.

Amazing how they didn't walk away from that with some serious malady or the ability to play the trumpet exceptionally well. In any case, their efforts were not in vain and they found some interesting pieces and lived happily ever after. The End.
