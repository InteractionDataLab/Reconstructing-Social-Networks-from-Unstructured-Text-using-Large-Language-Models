Welcome to University of Waterloo iGEM!
The UofW iGEM team was founded in the year of 1978, by now renown ecologist, David Suzuki. It was here in Waterloo where Mr. Suzuki first discovered his passion for micro biology and other shit. He loved to experiment on many plants along side his lab partners. Mr. Suzuki created the first ever iGEM group in University of Waterloo through his passion for Biological Engineering. We hope to make him proud by bringing home the gold this year!
Team
We promote diversity in our iGEM team. Encouraging people of all disciplines to partake in this incredible competition! From the Business faculty, to Arts, to Sciences, to Engineering, and back to Maths. These bunch collaborate in order to plan, design, construct and market our way to victory!
