3A Assembly Biwako-Nagahama original protocol
Reason
We succeeded in 3A Assembly using Linear Backbone from the Distribution Kit obtained from the iGEM Headquarter. But we could not succeeded in making 3A Assembly of the linear backbone taking reference of the Protocol of linear backbone found in the iGEM Homepage. So, we made our own 3A Assembly protocol suitable to our own lab environment that could increase the success rate of the experiment.
On discussing about the 3A Assembly with other participating teams, we found that other teams were not preparing their own protocol regarding 3A Assembly. We found that the 3A Assembly could be performed easily in the environment with certain restrictions. Because 3A Assembly is Assmbly method of the high probability not to need PCR and gel purification. So we tried to debug the available protocols and make our own protocols suitable to our own experimenting environment and help other teams with similar environment condition.
