Start
Nagahama Institute of Bio Science and Technology in Shiga has united together to participate in this competition for the first time. We, the iGEM Biwako-Nagahama team have been working on 2 projects, paper and ink.
The first one is “AgRePaper Project” in which we tried to make Agropaper by expression of curdlan and cellulose from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58.
Similarly we are trying to find out the ways to decompose and reuse the papers using Agrobacterium.
Our second project which is “E.coli-ink” & we have been working to prepare ink by overexpression of  Myoglobin from E.coli in this project.
