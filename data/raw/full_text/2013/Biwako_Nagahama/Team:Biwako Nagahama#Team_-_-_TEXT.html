Start
We are the first batch of the students from Nagahama Institute of Bio Science and Technology participating in this kind of competition. Nagahama Institute of Bio Science and Technology is located near to the lake Biwa in  Shiga Prefecture,Japan. We acquired our team name as Biwako Nagahama by the picking up our University name and combining it with the name of the lake that has made Shiga proud in whole Japan.
