Overview
We were able to developed a simple and informative deterministic model that is corroborated by a more complex stochastic model . Besides that, by using a mathematical approach we estimated the amount of report protein that should be expressed in order to be visible at naked eye, answering a basic and fundamental question about the functionality of our project.
