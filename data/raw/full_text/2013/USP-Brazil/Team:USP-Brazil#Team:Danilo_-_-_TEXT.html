Danilo Rodrigues Vieira
Master(ing) in Physical Oceanography - IO/USP
Graduated in Oceanography and is currently pursuing a master's degree in Physical Oceanography, researching bottom water masses variability in the Weddell Sea. Danilo is also a programmer (mainly MATLAB, Python and a bit of JavaScript), webmaster and webdesigner.
In his free time he enjoys traveling and taking photos. But most of the time you may find him tweaking his latest graphics, photoshopping, programming something unusual (like an animated MATLAB 3D christmas tree) or helping a friend design a poster or slides for a presentation.
He joined the team to help with mathematical models, but ended working most of the time in the Design and Human Practices group.
