Macarena López
Undergraduate in Biology - IB/USP
She is chilean but currently lives São Paulo, Brazil. She is at her third year of college and second year in the iGEM competition, but more than synthetic biology, what she really love is the anthropology field.
Maca (as she likes to be called) loves traveling around the world, learning new languages and getting to know different cultures. One of her dreams is to one day continue her research career in Germany.
