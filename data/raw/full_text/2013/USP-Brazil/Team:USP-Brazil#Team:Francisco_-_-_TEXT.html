Francisco Camargo
Graduate in Molecular Sciences - CCM/USP
Chico is someone who started as a wannabe physicist. Being driven by the idea of turning empirical knowledge into something quantifiable, testable and reproducible, he became increasingly interested in doing that to biology—and that brought him to system and synthetic byology.
He is particularly interested in bridging the gap between mathematical theory  and practical knowledge, and sees the iGEM competition as one of the coolest situations to do that.
