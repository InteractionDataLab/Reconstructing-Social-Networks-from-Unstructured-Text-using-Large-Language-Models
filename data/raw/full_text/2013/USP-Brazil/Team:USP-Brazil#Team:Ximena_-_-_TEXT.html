Luz Ximena Ochoa Cruz
Undergraduate student in Industrial Design - FAO/USP and Javeriana-Colombia
Industrial design student, passionate about ideas, facing projects as possibilities. For her there are no problems, there are only opportunities to see and rethink, design opportunities.
In design, as in life there are not absolute truths or magic formulas, questioning established and apparently normal processes will allows us to see new possibilities.
“Design is not what you see, but what you make others see”— by Edgar Degas
