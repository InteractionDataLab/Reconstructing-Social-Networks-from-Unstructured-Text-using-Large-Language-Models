Cauã Westmann
Undergraduate in Biology - IB/USP
Cauã is an undergraduate biologist passionated by life and its mysteries. He tries to understand everything in the most holistic way, from the origins of life to the evolution of complex systems, and found in science a path for his long quest.
Somewhere in the way a wild Synthetic Biology appeared joining so many areas of knowledge that Cauã could not resist. He was totally dragged into it!
He is learning a lot with the iGEM competition inside the lab and out of it, taking part in the Human Practices Project in order to approach society and science in a better way.
At this moment he is working with Molecular Biology in order to better understand the processes that underlie a “well known” and at the same time very complex phenomenon called Life.
