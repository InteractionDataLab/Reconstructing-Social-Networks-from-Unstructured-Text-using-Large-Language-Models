Paloma Andrade de Oliveira
Master(ing) in Visual Arts - ECA/USP
Multimedia developer, BASE jumper, researcher, educator and cultural producer, seeking convergences and applications of bio-digital technologies in the body and urban spaces.
Currently interested in the aesthetic possibilities and experiments in a body mediated by biophysical sensors (eletronic) and biosensors (microorganisms).
And that's how I got here, falling absolutelly in love with the micro wolrd and its possibilities :)
