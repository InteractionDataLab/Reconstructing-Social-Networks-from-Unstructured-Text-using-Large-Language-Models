Teddy Fagin
UC Berkeley, MCB
Avid sports fan, player, athlete, coach, dog show expert (conformation shows, with sights set on doing agility as well), and world traveler. Science enthusiast trying to better the planet.
Graduated from UC Berkeley last year, applied too late to join their successful 2012 team, reached out to other participating teams, and found my way to the wonderful city of São Paulo. Go team USP!
