Pedro Henrique Souza de Medeiros
Undergraduate in Pharmacy-Biochemistry - FCF/USP
My name is Pedro Medeiros, I'm 24 years old. I have a degree in Biological Sciences and I'm currently coursing Pharmacy-Biochemistry in the University of São Paulo.
Among my personal interests are general applications of new technologies in society, biotechnology, crowdsourcing projects, open development and anything that could bring more freedom, independence, social development and improvement in crucial aspects, such as energy, potable water, fuels, food and, mainly, education.
I believe science and technology as a way to improve and unite companies' activities, environmentally correct practices and social initiatives toward a better world.
