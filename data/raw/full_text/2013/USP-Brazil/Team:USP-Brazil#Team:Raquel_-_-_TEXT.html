Raquel de Souza Lima
Undergraduate in Biology - IB/USP
Raquel is a college student fascinated by biology and presents a very ecletic taste in this area: loves molecular biology; has a crush on anthropology, with focus on human evolution; has a love-hate relationship with botanical illustration and the taste for synthetic biology came to mess up those relationships even more =)
What she likes most in synthetic biology is the fact that different areas are interspersed and complement each other in a form so spectacular and unique and the iGEM is a cool competition that proves it.
Loves to read any kind of book, loves music, from rock to the classics and would be nothing without the support of her family (huge by the way) which is a key part in her life.
