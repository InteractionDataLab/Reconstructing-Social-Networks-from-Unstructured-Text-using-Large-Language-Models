Manaus_Amazonas-Brazil
On May, our iGEM team collaborated with Manaus team helping with their modeling. One member of our team, Marcelo Boareto, stayed in Manaus for a few days. There, he gave them a short course on modeling and helped then with problems specific to their project.

Brazilian teams
On August 17th, our team hosted an event witch brought together all the three brazilian teams (ours, Manaus and UFMG ). During the event, a member from each team presented the project and after that we discussed the projects and exchanged ideas.

TU-Eindhoven
Our team also collaborated with Synthetic Facts, a project from TU-Eindhoven team, helping to prove or disprove facts related to genetic modified crops based on the scientific literature.
The goal of Synthetic Facts is to provide an accurate and reliable source of information regarding the field of synthetic biology leading to the promotion of the field across the globe. This in turn will lead to a reduction in the number of Synthetic Facts available to misdirect those interested in the field of synthetic biology.
