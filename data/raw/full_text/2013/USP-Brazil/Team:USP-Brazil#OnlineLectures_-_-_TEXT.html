Online Courses in Synthetic Biology
In addition to the course in mathematical modelling, our team also prepared an online course on mathematical modelling in synthetic biology, as well as an online course on molecular biology. The courses are in portuguese, with their english translation in preparation. The videos are being hosted at our team's youtube channel .
Mathematical Modeling in Synthetic Biology
This course aims at those with basic undergraduate molecular biology knowledge, i.e., knowing roughly what do enzymes, promoters and DNA do, and with high school level mathematics—essentially knowing what are functions, and some elementary examples, namely power functions, trigonometric functions and logarithms. The goal of part A is to teach the basics of differential and integral calculus, focusing on explaining differential equations. Part B turns to Mathematical Modeling, explaining how to use differential equations to model the behavior of a biological system—focusing then on the most common examples in synthetic biology. Part C is made of special extra topics, for those who are familiar with parts A and B and want to deal with more complicated problems.
Part A - Mathematical Concepts
Lesson 1 - Derivatives, rules of derivation
Lesson 2 - Integrals
Lesson 3 - Applications of calculus
Lesson 4 - Differential equations
Lesson 5 - Numerical solution of differential equations: Euler method, implemented in python
Parte B - Modeling
Lesson 1 - What is modeling
Lesson 2 - Mathematical modeling of a population. Exponential and Logistic growth
Lesson 3 - Interacting species: Lotka-Volterra and Law of Massa Action - examples: promoters, activation, inhibition
Lesson 4 - Common models in Synbio: Michaelis Menten Enzime Kinetics, Hill coefficient
Lesson 5 - Complete example: Detecthol
Part C - Extra Topics
Lesson 1 - Linear stability analysis
Lesson 2 - Phase plane analysis
Lesson 3 - Spatial dynamics: diffusion, advection, saturation
Lesson 4 - Stochastic simulations: Gillespie algorithm
Lesson 5 - Difference equations and logistic maps
Molecular Biology
This course is turned to those with little or no undergraduate molecular biology knowledge - essentially, knowing what is DNA. The goal of part A is to teach the mechanisms behind what happens to DNA, RNA and proteins in replication, transcription and translation, while part B focuses on some basic lab techniques used during the iGEM competition.
Part A - Basic Concepts
Lesson 1 - Central dogma of molecular biology
Lesson 2 - DNA Replication
Lesson 3 - Transcription
Lesson 4 - Translation
Part B - Laboratory Techniques:
Lesson 1 - PCR
Lesson 2 - Gel
Lesson 3 - Bacterial transformation
Lesson 4 - BLAST
