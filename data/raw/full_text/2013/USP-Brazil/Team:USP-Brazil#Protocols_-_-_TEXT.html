Cloning
Plasmid DNA isolation (E.coli)
Extraction of plasmid DNA from E. coli by Alkaline Lysis – Miniprep
1.1)  Formation of pellets*
Transfer 1.5 ml of E. coli sample to eppendorf.
Centrifuge at 14000 RPM for one minute at 4°C.
Discard the supernatant.
Add the remaining E. coli, centrifuge again and discard the supernatant.
Resuspend in 200 μL of Solution 1 (P1) and vortex to dilute the entire pellet.
*: Keep all on ice
1.2)  Extraction of DNA
Add 200 μL of Solution 2 (P2) freshly made.
Solution 2*:
For 2 mL: 1860 μL of milliQ water, 40 μL of NaOH 10N, and 100 μL of SDS 20%.
For 5 mL: 4650 μL of milliQ water, 100 μL of NaOH 10N, and 250 μL of SDS 20%.
*: The reagents MUST be added in the order described. Stir after each mix. Do not put ice or you might have to redo if a precipitate (crystal) forms.
Gently invert 6 times.
Leave at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Add 200 μL of Solution 3 (P3), flip and put on ice immediately.
Centrifuge at 14000 RPM for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Collect the supernatant (with pipette) without getting any of the precipitate pellet moved into the new eppendorf. Collect 200 μL at a time with the pipette tip to prevent getting any of the pellet.
1.3)  Precipitation of DNA
Add 400 μL of isopropanol. Invert 5 times.
Connect the speed vaccum.
Centrifuge at 14000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Discard the supernatant and invert eppendorf over paper towel.
1.4)  Dry DNA
Add 500 μL of ethanol 70%. Invert 5 times.
Centrifuge at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Discard and speed vacuum for 15 minutes.
1.5)  Resuspend the DNA and degrade the RNA
Resuspend in 30 μL of milliQ water with light finger touches.
Treat with 5 μL RNAse per sample. Resuspend with light finger touches.
Leave at 37°C for at least half an hour.
Place in 20°C freezer for overnight storage.
2) Quantification by Nanodrop
Connect software.
Select option “Nucleic Acid.”
Place 2 μL of milliQ water on each pedestal and clean with paper towel.
Place 2 μL of milliQ water to calibrate the instrument and press “OK.”
Carry out the “Blank” using 2 μL of either milliQ water or buffer, depending on what you used to dilute your DNA sample.
Place 2 μL of sample and click measure.
Observe the quantification of DNA in ng/μL.
Also observe the ratio of 260/280, which must be around or greater than 1.7-1.8.
3) Digest to linearize the plasmid

Ethanol Precipitation of Plasmid DNA
Add 1/10 volume of Sodium Acetate (3 M, pH 5.2).
Add 2.5-3.0 X volume (calculated after addition of sodium acetate) of at least 95% ethanol.
Incubate on ice for 15 minutes. In case of small DNA fragments or high dilutions overnight.(incubation gives best results, incubation below 0 °C does not significantly improve efficiency.)
Centrifuge at > 14,000 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature or 4 °C.
Discard supernatant being careful not to throw out DNA pellet which may or may not be visible.
Rinse with 70% Ethanol (see note above for details)
Centrifuge again for 15 minutes.
Discard supernatant and dissolve pellet in desired buffer. Make sure the buffer comes into contact with the whole surface of the tube since a significant portion of DNA may be deposited on the walls instead of in the pellet.
Protocol for Miniprep from Plate (used when there was a large amount of samples) (E.coli)
Take the plates out of the fridge
Add 1 µL of media (LB) with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) to each well

Resuspend the pellets in an 8 ml of autoclaved cold 10% glycerol. Meanwhiletheotherthree pellets are onthe ice!
Resuspend the pellets remaining in the same solution, one at a time, gathering all the cells at the end! At the point you have 1 x 8mL tube.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 7000g at 4° C (you will need a balance). Discard the supernatant.

0.4ng/ µL = 1 µL of 20ng/ µL + 49 µL dH20;
0.2ng/ µL = 2 µL of 1ng/ µL + 2 µL dH20;

Connect the electroporation equipment(set pulse to 200 - machine above - and voltage to 2.5 kV)
Aliquot DNA to be transformed (diluted with water or resuspended precipitate without salt and water if necessary)
Transformation:
Mix bacterial DNA in eppendorf (approx. 50 to 100 ng for each 50mL of bacteria) and leave on ice for 1 min.
Transfer the volume from the cuvettes, dry the metal sides and electroporate (press the two red buttons simultaneously and release when you hear the "beep"). NOTE: Do not hold the metal cuvettes by side and not eletroporate with moist. Dry before!
IMMEDIATELY (In max. 30s) add 200μL of SOC to the cuvette and transfer the culture to the tube containing 750μL of SOC

Glycerol Stock for long-term storage of bacteria
Prepare the 96-well plate with 80 ul with 50% glycerol
Pipette 80 ul of bacteria and mix with a pipette with the glycerol. Cover the 96-well plate with adhesive cover along with plastic cover. Place glycerol stock in -70 ° C freezer.
Cell Cultures
Cell line and cultivation
Escherichia coli: strain DH10B, cultivated at 27 ° C and 250 rpm, in a medium with the antibiotic correspondent to its plasmid.

Gently mix 80μL of competent cells with 5-20μg of digested DNA (10μL).
Transfers all mix to 0,2cm cuvettes (for electroporation). (Be careful: do not allow bubbles formation, electric current will pass from outside instead of inside in this case)
Incubate cuvettes with yeast on ice for 5 to 10 minutes;
