Diego Dantas Almeida
PhD student in Biotechnology - PPIB/USP
Diego is a curious person by nature and fan of science in a general way, especially Molecular Biology and Physics.
He is fascinated by the idea of understanding and controlling the mechanisms that regulate life and the universe in their most elementary forms.
He also thinks that working with something involving different areas of knowledge is extremely exciting and have found in the iGEM competition a friendly environment in this way.
