Gabriel Rezende Nahas
Undergraduate in Chemical Engineering - Poli/USP
A chemical engineering student who loves biology. He believes the solution to the biggest problems mankind faces are already in nature and we just need to look carefully. He hopes in the future to work side by side with biologists to solve problems related to sustainability and climate changes.
He discovered iGEM by accident but found in the competition an opportunity to learn more and become a more multidisciplinary engineer. He has no idea what he is doing in a molecular biology lab, but he still finds it awesome.
