Regulating protein activity is important throughout science. In fundamental science you need to regulate the activity of the protein of intrest to investigate its function. In Synthetic Biology versatile regulating protein activity allows one to control the function of any constructed system. But eversince it is complicated to regulate protein activity with a good spatiotemporal resolution. Within our project we aim to engineer a system that enables everyone to easily control the activity of any protein of choice just with light.
