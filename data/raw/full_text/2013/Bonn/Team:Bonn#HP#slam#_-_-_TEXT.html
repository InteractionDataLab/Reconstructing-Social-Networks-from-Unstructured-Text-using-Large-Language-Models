What is a Science Slam?
In order to bring science closer to the broad masses we have decided to organize a science slam. Science must not only stay in laboratories and lecture halls: The Science Slam provides a platform for our slammers to share the passion for their project with more than just their colleagues and thus help to popularize their field. In ten minutes, they are going to present their topic in a playful and inspirational manner and the audience will decide which Slammer has managed to get them carried away the most.
