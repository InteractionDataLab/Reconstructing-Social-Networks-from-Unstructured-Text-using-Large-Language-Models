Introduction
To enable protein degradation we decided to use the ClpXP protease system which allows specific degradation              of proteins, is highly conserved and well established.             To make the the protein degradation light dependent, we then compared several systems to finally find the one that was best for our intended purpose. Moreover, we created a comprehensive overview of all systems allowing artificially light control so everyone can             easily choose the optimal system for his approach.
