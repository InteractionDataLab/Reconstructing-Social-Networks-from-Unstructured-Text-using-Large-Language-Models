Back Category: Human Practice
Overview
The major goal in Human Practices is to make Synthethic Biology easily understandable and interesting for everybody. For that purpose we introduced Synthetic Biology and our project to the generald public via developing a comic series, programming a computer game and conducted several presentations in schools all over Germany. In order to get the general public even more in touch with science we furthermore planned a Science Slam.
