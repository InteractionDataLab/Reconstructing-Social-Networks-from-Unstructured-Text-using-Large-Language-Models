Comic
In our effort to explain the concept of synthetic biology we created a comic series called "LOV WARS - The Adventures Of Obi Wan E.Coli". On his journeys through the Galaxy of Petri, Obi Wan and his friends try to fight the villain Darth Cherry and his companions, the clones. In five thrilling episodes they journey through various adventures, uncovering and explaining the concepts and methods used in iGEM.
