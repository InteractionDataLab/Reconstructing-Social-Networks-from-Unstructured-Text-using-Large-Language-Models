Overview
This module mainly consists of specific proteins secreted by our enginereed bacteria which act as a targeted tumor killer. Our choice of killer proteins are E4of4 and apoptin. Following bacterial secretion, spesific proteins penetrate into cancer cells and induce apoptosis within them. Recent studies have shown that the cancer specific proteins Apoptin and E4of4 have the ability of inducing apoptosis once inside a cancer cell. At this point, tumor specificity  is very crucial as it has the potential of damaging healthy cells during the contemporary cancer treatment. MPG and TAT were our choice of peptides which are capable of penetrating cancer cells together with Apoptin and E4of4; therefore decreasing the cancer populations rate of growth.
