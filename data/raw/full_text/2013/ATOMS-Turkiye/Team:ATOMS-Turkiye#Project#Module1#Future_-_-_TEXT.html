Future Plans
As a future plan, we can use our nanofactory by changing the antibody which targets a different antigen as well as targeting cells other than colon cancer cells.
In addition, the antibody nanofactories can be used to probe the AI-2 based response of bacteria not investigated further in the literature. Another important study would be to demonstrate selective targeting and manipulation using antibody nanofactories of a single type of bacterium within a mixed culture of bacteria. In these studies, the antibody nanofactories would target only one type of bacterium within the mixed culture and manipulate its response while leaving the other bacteria unaltered. This would be particularly useful in situations that typically involve different types of bacteria such as oral bacteria, bacteria of the gut and biofilms involving different bacterial species. These studies can be extended to co-cultures involving eukaryotic cell lines such as Caco-2 epithelial cells and bacteria such as E. coli and V. cholerae so as to investigate the effect of the biological nanofactories on the ability of the these bacteria to adhere to the Caco-2 cells. Such studies are important in the creation of an in vitro model of bacterial colonization and adhesion in the human gut. Also , instead of the addition of substrate SAH externally, a storage module in the form a vesicle or capsule containing SAH can be added to the biological nanofactory so as to provide the raw material (by release from the storage module) for conversion by the enzymes of the nanofactory at the targeted site.

Also we can repair or kill any damaged cells in the unhealty human body via targeting its with change our nanofactory’s antibody part. You can make each proteins antibodies. So you can target the all cells antigens via using nanofactory. Also you can detect the free/released proteins in any solution. That was detecting of our nanofactory. We could do these with changing antibody part of nanofactory.  If we change the enzyme part of nanofactory, we can make a lot of type of nanofactory.  If we fix the apoptin producer enzyme instead of luxs-Pfs system, we could do detecting and killing the cancer cells with only nanofactory. If we add a vesicle to one end of nanofactory to carry drug ,  we could do special cell targeting drug delivery. If we add antibody to each end of our nanofactory we could make specific cell/protein connector,binder. Etc. Specific adhesion protein between the other proteins or between the cells. You can bind any two protein in any solution with using two antibodies nanofactory as a linker.   If we add a immune system inviter to one end of nanofactory, you can detect an unhealty cell then invite immune system cells toward to detected cell human body.  We envision such nanofactories being used in the creation of the next generation of antimicrobials by selectively harnessing useful bacterial phenotypes and switching off harmful ones.(1)
