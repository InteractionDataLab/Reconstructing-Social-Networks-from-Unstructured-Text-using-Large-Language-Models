OVERVIEW
Unfortunately, cancer is the famously known leading cause of death around the world. Tumor-targeted therapy is one of the major areas in cancer research.The rationale behind using targeted delivery is to facilitate or increase the effectiveness of the delivered cargo to targeted tissue and to reduce unwanted and non-specific effects of it in the surrounding area of cancer cells. Therefore, the first module of our project offers tracing cancer cells using antigen antibody interactions. We have designed a system where a complex composed of antibodies attach to cancer cells specifically and an enzyme system which triggers bacteria to move towards the cancer cells effectively. This complex is also used as a quorum sensing molecule to trigger bacterial response. The bacteria produce these complex which then result in the production of a quorum sensing molecule as a feed back mechanism in the regions of cancer cells.
