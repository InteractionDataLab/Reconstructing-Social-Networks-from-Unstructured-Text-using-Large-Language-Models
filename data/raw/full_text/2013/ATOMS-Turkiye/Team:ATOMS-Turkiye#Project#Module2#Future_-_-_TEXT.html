Future Plans
Our future plans on module 2 is to continue to work on the apoptosis module, where there will be a number of steps we will take in the immediate future and others that form part of our long term plan.
Initially, we will perform test the apoptotic effects of E4of4 and Apoptin using alternative methods such as caspase 3 and annexin V.Because of these methods supporting certain data of apoptosis we will establish experimental results. It is important to give life to our in-vitro success in in-vivo. Therefore we will continue with experiment in vivo on our tumor killer proteins apoptin and E4of4. In order to improve our project, we will do modelling to enhance both effectiveness and activity of our time dependent apoptin and E4of4’s .
On the long run, Apoptin and E4of4 secretion system will be cloned in the non-pathogenic Nissle 1917 which is a probiotic strain of E.coli. Thus we will get to the stage of treating colon cancer using probiotic yoghurts which contain our engineered bacteria.
In order to promote safety levels we will express apoptin and e4of4 under specific inducible promoters of our choice. Therefore our constructs will secrete as long as we will it to. For example, as an inducing chemical we can use arabinose containing nutrients. This can be our on/off switch for the production of our killer proteins.
