Overview
It is not surprising at all if we name the cancer disease as our century’s health problem when it causes about 13% of all human deaths worldwide. It is also not surprising why a considerable amount of scientists working for decades to find an exact and efficient solution to this chaotic growing catastrophe. The more we improve ourselves in technology, the more we approaching the solution; but also we drifting apart by causing more cancer patients. This year, we want to focus on the possibility of an efficient treatment for colon cancer by using the advantages of synthetic biology. Unlike our last year’s project about the easy diagnosis of cancer, we want to propose a better and safe remedy option at this year’s Jamboree. In our plan, we are willing to design a safe E.coli strain which is able to detect possible cancer cells and destroy them selectively by releasing a kind of apoptosis inducing protein. To empower the system and to have better results, our plan includes using the properties of quorum sensing. With the ability to manipulate the gut flora without disturbing the body or without causing serious problems, we are looking forward to take a remarkable step about cancer treatment and attribute the society of science fairly.
