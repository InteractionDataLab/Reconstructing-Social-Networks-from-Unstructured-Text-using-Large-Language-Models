June 11th 2013
Brandon re-plated transformations from yesterday and they did not work. Brandon will leave them in the incubator a little longer to watch for growth, but does not expect any. Still waiting to hear back from Eric on the status of the ligation/transformation he did. Last Friday (6/7) he picked up digested backbone, Aer-EnvZ, and OmpR, and planned to ligate the pieces and transform them in time to allow them to grow before today’s 5:00 meeting. Eric was able to confirm our Aer-EnvZ+OmpR construct in his lab. It has been confirmed in wildtype E. Coli. We need to prepare chemically competent ΔOmpR, ΔEnvZ, and ΔOmpR+ΔEnvZ transform our plasmid into.
Whole group meeting
Aer/EnvZ is in the wild type.
Keep the website broad for now. But keep the offline files detailed.
Need to get the mutants for the cytoplasmic platform.
Can grow E coli on nitrates under anaerobic conditions as a negative control.
Design characterization experiments and controls for each construct.
For outreach on June 14th - videos, photos, short write up, demonstrations / activities done...
