While Eric is preparing chemi competent cells for transformation Brandon ligated Aer-EnvZ +OmpR + backbone again using the same digested pieces Eric used.
3:1 - 1 uL BB, 1 uL Ligase, 1 uL Buffer, 1.5 uL OmpR, 1.5 uL Aer/EnvZ, 4 uL sterile DI water.
5:1 - 1 uL BB, 1 uL Ligase, 1 uL Buffer, 3 uL OmpR, 3 uL Aer/EnvZ, 1 uL sterile DI water.
Ligated for 7 hours at room temperature.
Patrick transformed the ligations into TOP10 cells.  Used LB as a recovery medium.  Then added 250 uL of 500 g/L glucose at 30 minutes into recovery.  Plated cells both concentrated and not.  A small pellet was formed after centrifuging, so some cells may grow.
