Once again, the R Leg strain did not grow. This is unexpected, since I have already seen it grow in the TYC media I made the first time around. I am going to ask Eric about this.  The PCR I ran for HemAT at a wider range of temps(55, 60, 65) failed once more. I don’t know what could be causing this issue, so I am going to look into the primers first.  After talking to Eric, we have learned that R Leg and Azo are both unable to be stored in extreme cold as they are very sensitive, so they have become inactive after sitting in our cold room. I will get a new plate from Eric tomorrow, then grow it in our lab and make stock. I also plan to make more TY liqud media today.
