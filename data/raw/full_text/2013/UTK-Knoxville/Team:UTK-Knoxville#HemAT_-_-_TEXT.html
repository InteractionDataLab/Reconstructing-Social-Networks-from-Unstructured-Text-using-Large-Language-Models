HemAT
 
HemAT
Oxygen  gas, sensor FixL or HemAT (also need HemC).  list of Direct Oxygen sensors . FixL, was fused with 5 different kinases : “it was likely that the autophosphorylation activity of the  histidine kinase domain could not be regulated by the O2  association/dissociation in the sensor domain in the chimeric proteins” Intracellular & redox sensor.  O2 sensor, would be interesting.  & may also be able to sense  CO in the absence of oxygen  It seems like FixL is an O2 sensor. 
Sensing  domain is from 1-186 , its cytoplasmic, so it might not work on EnvZ.  It also does not HAMP domain so we do not  think it would work on a transmembrane kinase domain.
Chimeric  sensory kinases containing O2 sensor domain of FixL and histidine kinase domain  from thermophile.

T7 Promoter
The T7 promoter is constitutively expressed by the phage T7 RNA polymerase .  The polymerase is orthogonal to the wildtype E. coli promoters.
