July 18th 2013
The confirmation PCRs did not work. Confirmation digestion was negative as well. EcoRI and BamH1 were used for digestion. I am going to re-PRC entirely new pieces of backbone, Aer, EnvZ, OmpR, and the Aer-EnvZ chimera.
Aer and OmpR PCRs were unsuccessful. I ran a gel on all old DNA samples and only the old 5/30 Aer was still good. I am extracting EnvZ and Aer from the gel.
OEPCR:
12.5ul Q5 mm
150ng each template
7ul H20
*pause*
 
Add 1.25ul each primer.
25ul total
 
I grew up more PATBS01 to extract tomorrow as backup.
