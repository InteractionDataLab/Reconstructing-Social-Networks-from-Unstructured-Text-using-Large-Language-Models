Aer
 
Aer
Aer is a sensory protein that measures oxygen levels within  the cell, rather than externally. When low internal oxygen levels are sensed,  it will trigger reactions such as movement towards quickly oxidizable  substances such as glucose or ribose. It is located in the inner membrane of  the cell. Aer also regulates the expression of many genes involved in anaerobic  respiration. Aer is part of the PAS domain of sensing proteins.
 
EnvZ
Overview
EnvZ is the histidine kinase in the EnvZ-OmpR signal transduction system, located in the inner membrane. It contains two separate transmembrane regions. EnvZ autoposphorolates, then phosphorotales the transcription factor OmpR. EnvZ and OmpR are often seen as a single, polysistronic mRNA, although there is normally much less OmpR present in any given cell.

We chose Aer because it is a more recently studied gene, so  little is known about it. According to Nishiyama ,  Aer also has temperature sensing potential, so this could be another  interesting aspect our project.
Our construct consists of an Aer-EnvZ chimera protein  created view overlapping extension PCR (OEPCR), and a transcription factor,  OmpR. EnvZ is a histidine kinase that communicates with OmpR.

OmpR
OmpR is the transcription factor regulated by EnvZ. It is found in the cytosol. OmpR is phosphorolized by the kinase EnvZ, making the two dependent on each other. OmpR’s N-terminus must be phosphorolized by EnvZ in order to allow transcription of certain transmembrane genes; the C-terminus moderates multimerization of OmpR, which in turn controls transcription of outer membrane proteins..
 
T7 Promoter
The T7 promoter is constitutively expressed by the phage T7 RNA polymerase .  The polymerase is orthogonal to the wildtype E. coli promoters.
