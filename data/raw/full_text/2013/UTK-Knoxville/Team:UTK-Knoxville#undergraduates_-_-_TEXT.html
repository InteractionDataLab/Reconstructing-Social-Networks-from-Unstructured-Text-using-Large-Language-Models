Patrick Caveny Bio
I am a Senior in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship from Johnson City, TN.  My research interest is in synthetic biology and specifically its pragmatic applications, so iGEM is a great opportunity to meet other passionate researchers, explore the field with our work, and learn what is possible through genetic engineering.  After graduation I will be a graduate student at UT in the Bredesen Center pursuing a PhD in Energy Science Engineering.
Julie Hipp Bio
I am a Junior in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Chattanooga, TN. I am interested in synthetic biology, which makes iGEM a great opportunity for me to learn more about the field as well as meet fellow students interested in research. During the rest of my time as an undergraduate, I hope to learn how to apply the skills I have gained.
Brandon Wilbanks Bio
I am a freshman at UT in Chemical Engineering, with a Biomolecular Engineering focus. I also plan to minor in biology. I had the opportunity as a high school student last year to work on the iGEM team and, so this is my second year as part of iGEM. iGEM introduced me to the idea of synthetic biology, and I find the idea of using engineering methods with biological applications fascinating. I plan to go into a career in research after graduate work.
