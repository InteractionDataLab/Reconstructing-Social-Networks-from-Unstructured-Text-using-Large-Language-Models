NarX
Nitrate sensing: proof  of concept
NarX is the histidine kinase
NarL is the response regulator

Nitrate and Nitrite hybrid sensing protein (NarX + Tar) http://jb.asm.org/content/188/11/3944.full.pdf+html
this is what an old igem team did:
https://2009.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh . They used  NsrR
Didnt have a chimera - that is the difference
Do like 14-152 or 14-174

Experiment Procedure:
Add nitrate to the cell suspension.
The positive control will be...
The negative control will be no nitrate in the suspension.
Used a narK E. coli mutant which does not transport nitrate  across the membrane.  Adding  octylglucoside to the cell suspension increased
membrane permeability for  NO3.  When it was transported into the  cell it was reduced to NO2.  Adding N3  caused decreased NO3 and
thus nitrate reductase activity.
Nitrate uptake was sensed with nitrate ion selective  electrodes.

narK transport protein gene.  Used only during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate.
