Extracted and digested PATBS01 is in 37C incubator-8:30am. All others extracted from gel and frozen.  I am going to redo the OEPCR of the chimera. I am going to use 50ng each template as opposed to 150ng each. PATBS01 was extracted from the gel at 189ng/ul. The redone EOPCR looks good. Extracted and digested chimera, OmpR, and BB.
