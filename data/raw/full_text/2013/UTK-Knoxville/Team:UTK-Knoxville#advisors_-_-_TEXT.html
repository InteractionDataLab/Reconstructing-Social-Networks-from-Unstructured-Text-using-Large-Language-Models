Dr. Cong Trinh
Dr. Cong T. Trinh is an assistant professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering (with summa cum laude, honors thesis) at the University of Houston and earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He also worked at the Energy Biosciences Institute, University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral scholar. The Trinh Lab focuses on metabolic engineering and synthetic biology with a focus on the production of biofuels and other fine chemicals.
Dr. Gladys Alexandre
Dr. Gladys Alexandre is an associate professor in the Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. She received her B. S. in biology, her M. S. and Ph.D in microbial ecology from the Universite of Lyon 1, France. She worked as a postdoctoral scholar at Loma Linda University and Medical School, California and at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. Alexandre’s research interests include bacterial chemotaxis signal transduction in non-model bacteria and mechanisms of sensory information processing, using a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry and microscopy.
 
Ivan Geigerman Bio
I am a Senior at UT in Chemical Engineering, with a Biomolecular Engineering focus. I am honors process control engineering intern at Eastman Chemical and this is is my first year as part of iGEM. iGEM has engaged our team with real world applications of synthetic biology, and I find the this practice engineering methods with biological applications a great learning experience . I plan to go into a career in research after graduate work.
