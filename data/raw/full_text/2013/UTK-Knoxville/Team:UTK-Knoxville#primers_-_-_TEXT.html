Transmembrane    Construct
EnvZ_F
gtaagtcacgacttgcgcacgccgctgac
70
Amplifies EnvZ does not include    any overlap of the sensor part.
Envz_R
ggcggccgctctattagtgatggtggtgatgatgttacccttcttttgtcgtgc
75
Amplifies EnvZ (20 bp) and    includes overlap (34 bp) of the free space between it and the terminator.
OmpR_F
agaaataattttgtttaactataagaaggagatatacatatgcaagagaactacaagatt
64
Amplifies OmpR and overlaps with    the RBS and T7 promoter.  Note the    backbone needs to have the T7 promoter and RBS already.
OmpR_R
