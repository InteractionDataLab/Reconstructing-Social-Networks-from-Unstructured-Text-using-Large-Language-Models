June 29th, 2013
I checked ran a gel on the 6/28 PCR and it did not amplify RcoM. There was a small amount of primer activity at 56 and 60, but nothing significant at 64. I don’t know what could be causing this issue, so I am looking into our primer design to see if that is our problem.  The PCR for HemAT from R Leg failed again at 55, 60, and 65. I plan to look back over our primers on Monday to see if we have made any mistakes that are preventing the PCR from working.   We have discovered the issue with our NtrC primers (the reverse primer had the poly-a tail on the wrong end), so we have redesigned the primer and will order a new one.
