Ligation failed again.
We have discovered a frame shift in our chimera. Even if the construct had been successfully built, it would not function correctly.  We will redesign primers for the construct using Gibson assembly. We are first going to design primers for the TodS construct using Gibson to ensure that we can do Gibson correctly before ordering more primers.
