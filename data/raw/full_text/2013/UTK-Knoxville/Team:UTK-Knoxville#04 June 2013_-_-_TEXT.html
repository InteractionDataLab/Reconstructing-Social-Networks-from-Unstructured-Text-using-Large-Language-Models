June 04th 2013
The Aer-EnvZ piece after OEPCR is the correct size.  After looking back at what Julie did (5/30 PCR and May 31 digestion) with OmpR, Brandon reran her 5/30 PCR.  Brandon ran it at 58 C, 60 C, and 64 C.  Julie originally used 60 C, and the two primers are supposed to have melting temperatures of 58 C and 67C.  Tomorrow, assuming that OmpR works, Brandon will digest and ligate the pieces together.
