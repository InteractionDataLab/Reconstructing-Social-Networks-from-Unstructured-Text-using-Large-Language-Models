No plasmid from Eric yet. We have a meeting tonight and we can discuss this then.
We received primers for the HemAT construct today. PCR was run using NEB’s Q5 polymerase mastermix and protocol for setup and thermocycler(see protocols list). HemAT is 1296 bp long, which I will look to confirm in a gel tomorrow.
We recieved primers today for our RcoM construct. NEB’s Q5 polymerase mastermix along with protocol provided by NEB for reaction setup and thermocycler were used(see protocols). RcoM should be 708 bp.
