July 5th 2013
Brandon is going to work on rebuilding our Aer-EnvZ+OmpR construct, we might get it rebuilt in our lab before Eric returns what he had from us. I ran a gel to confirm that all our pieces are okay-the chimera is fine and so is OmpR. I need to re-digest the backbone.Aer-EnvZ and OmpR were extracted from the gel. I set up a digestion for the backbone.
