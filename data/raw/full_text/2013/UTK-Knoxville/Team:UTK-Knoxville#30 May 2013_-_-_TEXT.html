Thursday 30 May 13
Amplification of Aer, EnvZ, and OmpR from MG1655 gDNA:
Aer:
primers: Aer_f and Aer-EnvZ_1r
Tm: 52 and 55 (both worked the same, so lets use 55)     Expected length: about 860bp
EnvZ
primers: Aer_f and Aer-EnvZ_1r
Tm: 57 and 60 (both worked the same, so lets use 60)
Expected length: about 650bp
OmpR
primers: OmpR_r and OmpR_f
Tm: 60
Expected length: 720bp
Julie ran the gel and they all looked good.
Overlapping PCR of Aer/EnvZ
primers: Aer_f and EnvZ_r
expected length: 1490bp
The gel was kind of streaky because Julie changed something on the machine Julie shouldn’t have, but the band we wanted was still there. The Team had a fiasco with the gel kit though. Julie ran it back through a gel to see if it was still there and it wasn’t, so we need to redo that.
