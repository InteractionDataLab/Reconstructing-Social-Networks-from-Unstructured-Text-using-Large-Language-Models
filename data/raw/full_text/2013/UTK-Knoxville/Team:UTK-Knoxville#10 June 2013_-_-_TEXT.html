June 10th 2013
The incubator overheated so none of the plates grew.  We have a little bit of transformed cells left in liquid media, so new cells were transformed and plated.
Two cryogenic stocks were made.  TOP10 ΔOmpR, and TOP10 ΔEnvZ.
Still waiting to hear back from Eric on the ligation/transformation he’s doing.
