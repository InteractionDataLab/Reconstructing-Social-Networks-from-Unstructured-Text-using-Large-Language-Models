July 12th, 2013
Loaded sequences into  http://swissmodel.expasy.org/  in order to generate homology models for all of our full length chimeric protiens.
Gave Brandon plates of deltaOmpR Aer/envz constructs.
Went to meeting:
Am gdna prepping both the Gallionella and Bacillus over the weekend so that we can proceed with PCR on RcoM and HemAT
Noted that Chemotaxis biosensors was probably not the best title as only one of our sensing domains actually plays a role chemotaxis.  Maybe something like chimeric biosensors (not sold on that idea either though just throwing something out there)
Began discussing ways in which we can test aer.  Possible suggestion included growing cells in different TCA cycle intermediates due to the fact that this will effect the redox levels of the cell and therefore Aer.  For example succinate dehydorgenase converts succinate to fumarate and generates FADH2 from FADH.  Therefore, since since electrons are directly donated into the electron transport chain at this step we'd expect cells grown in an excess of succinate would flouresce different than cells grown in medium without it due to the different redox levels of the 2 cells.  Another possibility would be to use rapidly metabolizable carbons such as glycerol due to the fact that this process donates electrons as well.  The only other thing that I could think of is from the paper that I could not think of in lab meeting but finally found ( http://www.pnas.org/content/94/20/10541.full ) where they use 2,3 dimethoxy-5-Methyl 1,4 Benzoquinone.  This chemical has the opposite affect of glycerol as it inhibits respiratory enzymes.  I though the attached table overall provided some good examples of things to test ( http://www.pnas.org/content/94/20/10541/T2.expansion.html )
