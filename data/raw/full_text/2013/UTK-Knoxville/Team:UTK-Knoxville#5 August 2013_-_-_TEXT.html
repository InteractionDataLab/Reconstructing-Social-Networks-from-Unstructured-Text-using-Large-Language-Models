August 5th 2013
Received primers for the TodS sensing domain from Brandon
First attempted to PCR amplify the sensing domain from Psuedomonas Putida genomic DNA using a standard PCR protocol and a range of different possible annealing temperatures
After all PCR reactions failed to produce any bands (detected via 1% agarose gel), moved to the first method outlined in the following paper .
Since these reactions failed as well, August 6, 2013 will be spent using the BSA step PCR method with different organic solvents and in tandem with a touchdown pcr protocol
