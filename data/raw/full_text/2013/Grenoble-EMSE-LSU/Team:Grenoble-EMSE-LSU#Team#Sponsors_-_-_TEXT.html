All of the institutes, laboratories or companies below have chosen to help us on our iGEM adventure, in many various ways. We would like to thank all of them for their support which has been essential to the accomplishment of our project.
Louisiana State University , Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne , Joseph Fourier University , Grenoble INP , City of Grenoble , La Métro , Minatec , CIME Nanotech , LMGP , LIPhy , CEA , CNRS , Inria , CAD4Bio , IXXI , France Embassy , MathWorks
Louisiana State University
Louisiana State University and Agricultural & Mechanical College is home to the "Fighting Tigers" and their Bengal tiger mascot, Mike VI.  LSU is the flagship institution of the state of Louisiana, USA and is one of only 30 universities nationwide holding land-grant, sea-grant and space-grant status.
Since 1860, LSU has served the people of Louisiana, the region, the nation, and the world through extensive, multipurpose programs encompassing instruction, research, and public service.  The University brings in more than $150 million annually in outside research grants and contracts, a significant factor for the Louisiana economy.
Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne
This school belongs to the French “Grandes Écoles” system and has held onto its core values: education, research, and dedication to economic development.  Created in 1813 École des Mines de Saint-Etienne has been delivering academic programs and research relevant to the requirements of today’s and tomorrow’s business. In two centuries, the School has been transformed from an elite vocational school to a fully integrated graduate research college. Most of its students work in many leading positions in very different spheres like mathematics, medical-engineering, computing or management.
Université Joseph Fourier
Université Joseph Fourier (UJF) is one of Europe's leading universities. It offers its students high-quality education, providing them with a passport to the professional world. UJF has acquired this international status through the quality of its teaching and the excellence of its research, much of which takes place in collaboration with major international and national organisations.
Grenoble INP
The Grenoble Institute of Technology is one of Europe's leading technology universities, at the heart of innovation from more than a century. It is involved in major development projects such as Minatec, or the Minalogic (micro and nanotechnology and embedded software) and EnRRDIS (renewable energy) industrial clusters. With its solid combination of teaching, research and business promotion, Grenoble Institute of Technology plays a key role in making Grenoble one of the most attractive scientific and industrial locations worldwide.
Ville de Grenoble
Grenoble is the capital of the French Alps. Grenoble is famous for its great ski resorts: Alpes d'Huez, Les Deux Alpes, but also for its ice hockey team "Les Brûleurs de Loups", or its rugby team "FC Grenoble". Grenoble is also one of the largest French university towns. The city of Grenoble encourages and supports all the projects of his students and follows us in our iGEM adventure.
La Métro
The urban community "Grenoble Alpes Métropole", commonly called "La Métro", is located in the center of an half million inhabitants urban area. Second metropolis of the Rhône-Alpes region after Lyon, "La Métro" combines 27 communes around a single objective: to improve the daily lives of its 400,000 inhabitants. "La Métro" brings together the energies of its member municipalities to develop major projects, conduct political activities and develop the territory.
Minatec
MINATEC has created a powerful collaborative work environment that attracts leading international-caliber scientists in the fields of optronics, biotechnologies, components, circuit design, and motion sensing by bringing professionals together to work shoulder to shoulder in project mode, pooling know-how, and providing shared resources like open technology platforms.
CIME Nanotech
The CIME Nanotech facility is a university training and research center in Grenoble, devoted to all aspects of micro- and nanotechnologies and their applications in microelectronics, energy production and biotechnologies. Organized by Grenoble Universities, the CIME is located in MINATEC. During the summer, the team used the biotechnology facility for meetings, numerical simulations and biological experiments.
LMGP
The LMGP is the Materials Science and Physical Engineering Lab. It designs, elaborates and characterizes materials for everyday applications: micro-electronics, energy production and health. It is composed of 30 permanents researchers, 15 engineers and technicians, 30 PhD students and post-doctorals fellows.
LIPhy
The LIPhy is the Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Physics. It has 3 main axis of research: optics and its applications, physics of and for the life sciences and complex matter.
CEA
The CEA is the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives). It is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA mission statement has two main objectives : To become the leading technological research organization in Europe and to ensure that the nuclear deterrent remains effective in the future.
CEA organizations which support our project are:
«CEA- Direction des Sciences du vivant»
«CEA- Direction des Sciences de la Matière»
«CEA-Direction de la Recherche Technologique»
Programme Transversal Nanotoxicologie
Programme Transversal Technologies pour la Santé
Programme transversal Nanosciences
CNRS
The "Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique" (National Center for Scientific Research) is a government-funded research organization, under the administrative authority of France's Ministry of Research. CNRS encourages collaboration between specialists from different disciplines in particular with the university thus opening up new fields of enquiry to meet social and economic needs. CNRS has developed interdisciplinary programs which bring together various CNRS departments as well as other research institutions and industry.
Inria
The "Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique" (National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control) is a government-funded research organization, which focuses on communication and information sciences and technologies.
CAD4Bio
CAD4Bio provides computer-aided design solutions for synthetic biology. The fully integrated CAD4Bio software supports the design of genomic constructions and the computation of all the data required to carry out the synthesis and assembly processes for both high-throughput liquid-handling robots and human operators.
IXXI
The Rhône-Alpes Complex Systems Institute is a multidisciplinary center for education and research in the study of complex systems, such as biological or social systems, technological networks.
Embassy of France
Currently, the Embassy of France in the USA is headed by François Delattre. It is based at Washington DC. and is the largest French diplomatic mission in the world.
MathWorks
MathWorks is excited to be an iGEM partner! MathWorks is the leading developer of mathematical computing software, such as MATLAB, SimBiology and Bioinformatics toolbox. MathWorks will provide iGEM teams with complementary MathWorks software to help model, simulate and optimize their assemblies.
