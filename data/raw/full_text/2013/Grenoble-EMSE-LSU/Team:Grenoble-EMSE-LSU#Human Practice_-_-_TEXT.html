Human Practice
The iGEM competition is about carrying a project that we entirely designed towards a jury, and to confront it to those of all the other teams. But there is more to it than the scientific part: the Human Practice part of our project is just as important to us as the biology and modelling parts.
IGEM Promotion
We first wanted to promote iGEM in our universities, in the research labs nearby and to everyone who would ask us about it, because we are proud to be part of this competition, and proud of the project we have been elaborating since January, and working on all summer.
Lyon Jamboree
We also thought that the Jamboree was a great place to meet and interact with a lot of different people from all around Europe, and even the world if we have the chance to make it to Boston ! To encourage such a behaviour, we designed an activity that will take place through the whole weekend.
Video Game
Another aspect of the iGEM promotion that we decided to develop a bit more, is to explain what synthetic biology is. That is why we developed a video game that can teach you the basics of synthetic biology. Indeed only few people know about this field of science, and even less know it well enough to appreciate what it can bring to science.
Collaboration
Collaboration is crucial in the iGEM experience as it can build strong relationship between two teams. This year, we collaborate with two iGEM teams.
