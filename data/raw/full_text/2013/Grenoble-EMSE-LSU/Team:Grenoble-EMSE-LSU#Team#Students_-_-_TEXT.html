Our Team
This year, our team is composed of students from various horizons. We have a majority of Grenoble students (six) but also two students from Saint-Etienne and even one American student from Louisiana, making our team international !
We are six studying engineering, and three studying in college. You can read our presentations below for further information:

Grenoble University
Licence 2 International Chemestry and Biology
At the very first time I heard of iGEM it sounded like a great idea to me: giving a group of student the opportunity to work together on their own project, each team being a sort of melting pot of skills and knowledge. I also like the fact that this competition highlights synthetic biology, which is not well recognised by the students.
Hélène Arduin
Grenoble INP - Phelma
Master 1 Physics and Nanosciences
As a physics student, I would really like to discover a new field, biology, which I do not have studied before. I wish to work on a research lab after graduating, and I think the iGEM project is a great opportunity to discover this environment and to work as a team, in collaboration with various research labs. The international dimension of this project is also really motivating: we will be given the opportunity to compare ideas with teams from all around the world !

ENSM Saint-Etienne
Master 1 Fundamental Physics and Health-Engineering
I conceive my participation to the iGEM project as a way to deal with many different scientific knowledge as well as experimental exercises in order to reach an unbelievable goal in synthetic biology. Therefore I’m glad to be a member of Grenoble-St-Etienne-LSU team because this project deals with hard technical issues and wouldn’t be possible without a strong team work. According to my point of view, this must be a step for my future career.
Stewart W. Humble
Louisiana State University
BSc Biological Sciences
When I first heard about becoming involved with the iGEM team at Grenoble, I immediately jumped on the opportunity.  Taking some time to learn more about iGEM, I researched projects from previous years, and found the premise of the competition was very interesting.  The promise of a truly unique and rewarding international experience and the opportunity to represent LSU on a global scale are what I am most looking forward to as I become more involved with the team at Grenoble.
Quentin Lubart
Grenoble University
Master 2 Nanobiology and Nanobiotechnology
When I was introduced to iGEM my immediate reaction was: "I have to participate." I see this event as a chance to make a technical prowess at the top of innovation in a growing field, all of this at a very high international level. Many efforts are made to ensure that the only barrier we have is imagination, how to resist?

Biotechnologies
“All together, design, develop, test and present your own biological system, in a pluridisciplinary and international context.” It sounded to me like a golden opportunity at both the scientific and human level, and iGEM has been a very formative and fulfilling experience so far. Optogenetics offers bright prospects to the understanding and treatment of a broad set of diseases, including cancer and brain disorders. I am glad that we found a project related to that field, in which I would like to be involved in the future.

Biotechnologies
The iGEM competition incarnates the interface between one of my main subjects of interest – synthetic biology - and other fields such as modelling, electronics, optics and environmental sciences. The sheer opportunity it represents is what really drove me to participate in this ambitious and fun project. With the multitude of different aspects to take care of, I believe the competition will provide invaluable experience on working as a team, using rigorous techniques in a laboratory environment. Finally, as research is never an endeavour to be undertaken alone, even as a team, I look forward to interacting with iGEM teams all over the world.
Nicolas Roehri, aka Rorri Stark, the king in the Lab !

Biotechnologies
The iGEM competition seems to me to be a great way to apply all the skills and techniques I learned during my studies at Grenoble INP – Phelma. As a student in Bioengineering, this competition will allow me to improve my knowledge in molecular biology and learn to deal with problems that can occur in lab work. Moreover, since we have this year an international team, it will be a good opportunity to share different points of view or approach on several items.
That's why I needed to be part of the adventure !
François Rousse, aka Dolphman, the jester in the Lab !
ENSM Saint-Etienne
Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
I had know the iGEM competition 2 years ago when friends participated. I saw in it the most efficient and clever way to impel and spread a young and thriving science. I heard that real revolutions can only come from life sciences, the iGEM competition is a unique opportunity to be part of it.
