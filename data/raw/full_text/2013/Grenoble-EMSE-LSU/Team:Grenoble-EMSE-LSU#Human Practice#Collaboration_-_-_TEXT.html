Collaboration
Collaboration is an important part of iGEM experience. It's the first step of the creation of a community around synthetic biology. This        year, the iGEM Grenoble-EMSE-LSU team was involved in two collaborations :
The ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team believe that communication about safety issues can improve overall safety levels in synthetic        biology. Their outreach consisted in accumulating information on other teams' safety issues with their projects.         We contributed our data on KillerRed, applied to analyse its potential risks and the consequent measures taken to ensure         the safety of the researchers and the general public, as well as preservation of the external environment (see below).        We hope the collaboration with the ATOMS-Turkiye team will help encourage other teams to communicate about Safety;         as it is as essential as the synthetic biology we work on, communication and collaboration should be on the same         level for both. Thus we put this collaboration on he same level as synthetic biology for our team's outreach effort.
We collaborated with the NRP-UEA-Norwich 2013 iGEM team to send a soil sample from Grenoble to them.         Their project attempts to identify the antimycin-producing bacteria present in different soils accross         the globe and so in this case collaboration with other iGEM teams is essential.
