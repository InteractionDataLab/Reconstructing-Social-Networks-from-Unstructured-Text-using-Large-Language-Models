Project Overview
Team NRP-UEA-Norwich iGEM 2013 are developing a biosensor that will enable the identification of novel antimycin-producing strains of streptomycetes. Building up a library of antimycin gene clusters will broaden known pathway (biosynthetic) diversity with the foresight of facilitating genetic engineering. In the long term, pathways could be engineered to create new variants of antimycin with unique or enhanced properties.
Soil Samples
To aid our project we need numerous soil samples and sediments from various locations so we can find as many different Antimycin producing streptomycetes as possible..
Blog
Check out our blog to find more information about our project and see how you can be involved by giving us a soil sample!
