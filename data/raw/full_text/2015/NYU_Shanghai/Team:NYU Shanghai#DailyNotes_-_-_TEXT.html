Misya’s presentation on E.chromi. IDT representatives visited our lab and showed us how to order DNA on the website. Introduction to transformation lab with arabinose, pGLO, nutrient broth, and ampicillin. Bio majors practiced lab skills and taught Interactive Media Arts majors how to do lab. It was fun! Let’s see if our E.coli can glow tomorrow!.
2 June 2015
Spencer’s presentation on biological oscillators. The results of yesterday’s lab were kind of disappointing. GFP was not expressed and not visible under UV light. Most likely because of old agar plates. Bio majors tested our first transformation using a part from the kit (RFP generator) and made new agar plates. Bruno helped ZZ build our new color-tracking system with a web camera and Processing.
3 June 2015
Bruno, Christian, and Xiaoyue’s workshop on Virtual Reality of the inside of cell with the help of Unity 3D. Got chance to experience the bacteria world with the brand-new and exciting tool.

17 July 2015
Getting ready for the Asia conference.
20-24 July 2015
Attended the iGEM Asia Conference hosted by National Chiao Tong University. We learned a lot from other teams and met some really awesome people! We also took a couple days off to explore Taipei area. A good trip.
28 July 2015
Report of our Taiwan trip to our Professors. Potential troubleshooting methods for our lack of color included: adding a RFP reporter gene, sending the parts for seqeuencing, restarting construction from the beginning, and experimenting with arabinose concentrations.
29 July 2015
Our IDT plasmids arrived! Realized only 1000ng of DNA came, thus began designing primers so that we could amplify the sequence (never designed primers before–Snapgene is a great tool!). Sangon agreed to be a donator! Rethinking about our physical installation. Thankful that NEB sent us free Q5 polymerase earlier in the summer.
30 July 2015
Welcoming our new tech helper--Lewei (Richard) Huang! Also interviewed by The Good Life magazine! Figuring out the data transfer of our new installation. Sangon came to pick up our constructed plasmids for sequencing. Realized that iGEM primers are not common primers...we'll see how sequencing goes.
31 July 2015
Went to Fudan University, had lunch with their team members, and learned about the sequencing process, using T-vecors, ordering primers, and general lab procedures. They also gave us their iGEM kits, since we ran out of luciferase generators (our last transformation didn't work). Thank you Fudan iGEM Team!
3 Aug 2015
Consulted Antonius about our coding difficulties and he offered some good suggestions. Two cameras running with one Processing sketch! Yay! Spencer is back from America, back to making chromoprotein constructs.
4 Aug 2015
Virtual Reality project still making progress. Xiangci still coding. Lab meeting held, and new lab policies established to make work more efficient (Friday is inventory check-day, pre-lab requirements, attendance time, etc.)
5 Aug 2015
Getting ready for the 8 iGEM Teams project exhibition at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. Gel extraction of digested backbones (PCR is probably a much more efficent way to do this).
6 Aug 2015
Code reconstructed and the we can produce live music now! Hurray! First PCR of the summer–amplified gBlocks recieved from IDT.  Found out we needed to add luciferin + ATP to the luciferase generator to generate light.
7 Aug 2015
PCR Purification came out imperfect (a 2.77 260:280 ratio?). Ran another PCR for less non-specific bands. Installation makers and coders hurry to prep for tomorrow.
8 Aug 2015
iGEM Show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum! Along with Fudan, Shanghai Jiaotong, Tongji Wetware, Tongji Software, Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool, and Zhejiang University. Our bacterial music generator and virtual reality simulations were a success!
10 Aug 2015
Digested and ligated IDT sequences to backbone. If ligation went well, we should see color tomorrow...Sequencing results also back, and all of our previous constructs contained only GFP and CFP, not even a promoter.
11 Aug 2015
No color. Realized that pBAD promoter is inhibited by glucose, and that we've been using SOC media (containing glucose) to do all our transformations. Lesson learned. Talked with Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool University as to how to produce color (they are also working with chromoproteins). Got our LED light strip for our plate stage. Did the test run on the laser cutter for the camera stand.
12 Aug 2015
Ann, Sohigh, and Spencer left for the Beijing University iGEMers Conference! Rachel, ZZ, Xiangci, and June are still working hard in Shanghai.
13-15 Aug 2015
The Beijing Conference was a great experience. We were definitely awe-struck by the level of research and development of the other teams. We also got to try to 'perform' our project--we turned of all the lights on stage before our presentation and it was a wonderfully dramatic experience. Thank you Beijing University! And thank you many other teams (like Shanghai Ocean University and Northeast Forestry University for their advice on working with the pBAD promoter and chromoproteins, respectively.
17 Aug 2015
Last week of iGEM for us (before we all leave to different countries). Everything is a big rush now.
18 Aug 2015
Today Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool University drove all the way from Suzhou (2 hours) to send us plasmids, bacteria containing plasmids, and extra bacteria! THANK YOU XJLTU! They were also working with chromoproteins, and sent us their materials so that we could produce some color in the lab before we left.
19 Aug 2015
Another filming day, this time the final project is completely put together--step sequencer, tube rack, and button control. We planned to start shooting at 10AM, but a lot of difficulties kept coming up, so we ended up starting the shoot around 4pm. It was a really great feeling being able to see everything put together. Today was ZZ and Xiangci's last day.
20 Aug 2015
The last day together. We cleaned out the lab fridge. It was very painful throwing away the summer's work of plasmids. We cleaned out the IMA lab and we our classroom 307. We made a round of thank you's to all the administration who helped set up iGEM. The work is still not done... we have the film editing, wiki, VR, T-shirts, presentations, posters, etc. But the next time we meet as a full team will be in Boston. So this is the last daily update of our iGEM journey.
