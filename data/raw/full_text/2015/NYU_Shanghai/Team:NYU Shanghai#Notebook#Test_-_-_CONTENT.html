Let’s see if our E.coli can glow tomorrow!.</P><H3>2 June 2015</H3><P>Spencer’s presentation on biological oscillators. The results of yesterday’s lab were kind of disappointing. GFP was not expressed and not visible under UV light. Most likely because of old agar plates. Bio majors tested our first transformation using a part from the kit (RFP generator) and made new agar plates. Bruno helped ZZ build our new color-tracking system with a web camera and Processing.</P><H3>3 June 2015</H3><P>Bruno, Christian, and Xiaoyue’s workshop on Virtual Reality of the inside of cell with the help of Unity 3D. Got chance to experience the bacteria world with the brand-new and exciting tool. Also, Reida’s RFP plasmid transformation showed a fluorescence in one colony! Prep work for second transformation lab including CFP, RFP, and GFP.</P><H3>4 June 2015</H3><P>Xiangxi’s presentation on mathematical modeling. Tristan’s Google Hangout workshop on Java/Animation in HTML. Bio majors made 54 LB agar plates with different concentrations of chloramphenicol resistances (12.5, 25, 34, 50 mg/ml).</P><H3>5 June 2015</H3><P>Ann’s presentation on Mini-prep. Everyone did Mini-Prep lab. DAN Quantitation of Mini-Prep we did. Xiangci talked about developing Virtual Reality Project for Human Practice with Christian.

Brainstormed more details of our project. pGLO glowed! Bio majors transformed luciferase generator parts from the kit. </P><H3>12 June 2015</H3><P>Ann led a recap session before her 2 week leave. Lab team made competent cells. Strikingly page is up for sponsors!</P><UL><LI>Here's what we did</LI><LI><A href="#">Lab Results for today</A></LI></UL><H3>15 June 2015</H3><P>Started working on Virtual Reality (VR). Made a lot of agar plates and transformed chromoprotein parts.</P><H3>16 June 2015</H3><P>RFP glows! Inoculation of chromprotein parts.</P><H3>17 June 2015</H3><P>Miniprep of chromoprotein parts. Nanodrop results could have been better...our average was 18.8 ng/uL. We just need a little more practice? Our IMA tech guy introduced some new ideas for our final project, and we discussed with him new ways of integrating the colorful colonies into a step sequencer.</P><H3>18 June 2015</H3><P>Spencer's workshop on plasmid construction. Tried to do restriction digest, but no results seen on the gel (ES). We tried following NEB protocol (not iGEM) and it also didn't show on the gel.</P><H3>19 June 2015</H3><P>Skype meeting with ZZ to discuss more details of final project. Another round of restriction digest (Xbal and PstI), and it worked!</P><H3>23 June 2015</H3><P>More development on the design of the final project. Attempt sequential digest with EcoRI and SpeI.
