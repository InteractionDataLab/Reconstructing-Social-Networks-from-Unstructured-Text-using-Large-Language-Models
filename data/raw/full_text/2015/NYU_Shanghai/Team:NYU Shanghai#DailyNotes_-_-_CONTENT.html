Let’s see if our E.coli can glow tomorrow!.</P><H3>2 June 2015</H3><P>Spencer’s presentation on biological oscillators. The results of yesterday’s lab were kind of disappointing. GFP was not expressed and not visible under UV light. Most likely because of old agar plates. Bio majors tested our first transformation using a part from the kit (RFP generator) and made new agar plates.

Nanodrop results could have been better...our average was 18.8 ng/uL. We just need a little more practice? Our IMA tech guy introduced some new ideas for our final project, and we discussed with him new ways of integrating the colorful colonies into a step sequencer.</P><H3>18 June 2015</H3><P>Spencer's workshop on plasmid construction. Tried to do restriction digest, but no results seen on the gel (ES). We tried following NEB protocol (not iGEM) and it also didn't show on the gel.</P><H3>19 June 2015</H3><P>Skype meeting with ZZ to discuss more details of final project. Another round of restriction digest (Xbal and PstI), and it worked!</P><H3>23 June 2015</H3><P>More development on the design of the final project. Attempt sequential digest with EcoRI and SpeI. No results. </P><H3>24 June 2015</H3><P>Skype meeting with one of our potential sponsors. Developed design of Processing part. Another digest, this time a double digest with EcoRI and SpeI.

Tested the usb webcame modules. Interviewed bio-artist Vivian Xu, DJ Benjamin Bacon about biology, art, step sequencers, and experimental music. Our Strikingly page made it to the Strikingly discover page! http://igemnyushanghai.strikingly.com </P><H3>14 July 2015</H3><P>FUN DAY! Filmed our swag team introduction video for the coming NCTU iGEM conference and took group photos. Got team T-shirts for the NCTU conference! Got a sponsorship package from DFRobot filled with Arduino boards, sliders, buttons, LEDs, and many other cool electronic components for our installation.

We learned a lot from other teams and met some really awesome people! We also took a couple days off to explore Taipei area. A good trip. </P><H3>28 July 2015</H3><P>Report of our Taiwan trip to our Professors. Potential troubleshooting methods for our lack of color included: adding a RFP reporter gene, sending the parts for seqeuencing, restarting construction from the beginning, and experimenting with arabinose concentrations.  </P><H3>29 July 2015</H3><P>Our IDT plasmids arrived! Realized only 1000ng of DNA came, thus began designing primers so that we could amplify the sequence (never designed primers before–Snapgene is a great tool!). Sangon agreed to be a donator! Rethinking about our physical installation. Thankful that NEB sent us free Q5 polymerase earlier in the summer.</P><H3>30 July 2015</H3><P>Welcoming our new tech helper--Lewei (Richard) Huang! Also interviewed by The Good Life magazine! Figuring out the data transfer of our new installation. Sangon came to pick up our constructed plasmids for sequencing. Realized that iGEM primers are not common primers...we'll see how sequencing goes.</P><H3>31 July 2015</H3><P>Went to Fudan University, had lunch with their team members, and learned about the sequencing process, using T-vecors, ordering primers, and general lab procedures. They also gave us their iGEM kits, since we ran out of luciferase generators (our last transformation didn't work). Thank you Fudan iGEM Team! </P><H3>3 Aug 2015</H3><P>Consulted Antonius about our coding difficulties and he offered some good suggestions. Two cameras running with one Processing sketch! Yay! Spencer is back from America, back to making chromoprotein constructs.</P><H3>4 Aug 2015</H3><P>Virtual Reality project still making progress. Xiangci still coding. Lab meeting held, and new lab policies established to make work more efficient (Friday is inventory check-day, pre-lab requirements, attendance time, etc.) </P><H3>5 Aug 2015</H3><P>Getting ready for the 8 iGEM Teams project exhibition at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. Gel extraction of digested backbones (PCR is probably a much more efficent way to do this). </P><H3>6 Aug 2015</H3><P>Code reconstructed and the we can produce live music now! Hurray! First PCR of the summer–amplified gBlocks recieved from IDT.  Found out we needed to add luciferin + ATP to the luciferase generator to generate light.</P><H3>7 Aug 2015</H3><P>PCR Purification came out imperfect (a 2.77 260:280 ratio?). Ran another PCR for less non-specific bands. Installation makers and coders hurry to prep for tomorrow.</P><H3>8 Aug 2015</H3><P>iGEM Show at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum! Along with Fudan, Shanghai Jiaotong, Tongji Wetware, Tongji Software, Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool, and Zhejiang University. Our bacterial music generator and virtual reality simulations were a success!</P><H3>10 Aug 2015</H3><P>Digested and ligated IDT sequences to backbone. If ligation went well, we should see color tomorrow...Sequencing results also back, and all of our previous constructs contained only GFP and CFP, not even a promoter. </P><H3>11 Aug 2015</H3><P>No color. Realized that pBAD promoter is inhibited by glucose, and that we've been using SOC media (containing glucose) to do all our transformations. Lesson learned. Talked with Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool University as to how to produce color (they are also working with chromoproteins). Got our LED light strip for our plate stage. Did the test run on the laser cutter for the camera stand.</P><H3>12 Aug 2015</H3><P>Ann, Sohigh, and Spencer left for the Beijing University iGEMers Conference! Rachel, ZZ, Xiangci, and June are still working hard in Shanghai. </P><H3>13-15 Aug 2015</H3><P>The Beijing Conference was a great experience. We were definitely awe-struck by the level of research and development of the other teams. We also got to try to 'perform' our project--we turned of all the lights on stage before our presentation and it was a wonderfully dramatic experience. Thank you Beijing University! And thank you many other teams (like Shanghai Ocean University and Northeast Forestry University for their advice on working with the pBAD promoter and chromoproteins, respectively. </P><H3>17 Aug 2015</H3><P>Last week of iGEM for us (before we all leave to different countries). Everything is a big rush now. </P><H3>18 Aug 2015</H3><P>Today Xian-Jiaotong Liverpool University drove all the way from Suzhou (2 hours) to send us plasmids, bacteria containing plasmids, and extra bacteria! THANK YOU XJLTU! They were also working with chromoproteins, and sent us their materials so that we could produce some color in the lab before we left. </P><H3>19 Aug 2015</H3><P>Another filming day, this time the final project is completely put together--step sequencer, tube rack, and button control. We planned to start shooting at 10AM, but a lot of difficulties kept coming up, so we ended up starting the shoot around 4pm. It was a really great feeling being able to see everything put together. Today was ZZ and Xiangci's last day.</P><H3>20 Aug 2015</H3><P>The last day together. We cleaned out the lab fridge. It was very painful throwing away the summer's work of plasmids. We cleaned out the IMA lab and we our classroom 307. We made a round of thank you's to all the administration who helped set up iGEM. The work is still not done... we have the film editing, wiki, VR, T-shirts, presentations, posters, etc. But the next time we meet as a full team will be in Boston. So this is the last daily update of our iGEM journey.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
