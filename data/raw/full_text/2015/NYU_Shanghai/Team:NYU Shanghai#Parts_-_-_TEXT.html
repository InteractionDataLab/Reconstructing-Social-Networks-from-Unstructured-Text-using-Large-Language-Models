Weâ€™ve created three different types of colored E. Coli.
Chromoproteins
Pigmented compounds that absorb and reflect visible light.
Fluorescent Proteins
Pigmented compounds that absorb UV light and emit visible light.
Luciferase Enzymes
Catalyzes conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin. Energy is released in the form of the light.
Chromoproteins
We created constructs to express 3 different colors of chromoproteins: blue, lime, and yellow. These were taken from the registry, created in 2010 by the Cambridge iGEM team.

XJTLU team used the T7 promoter in a bl21 E. Coli. This produced good blue and yellow color in our lab.
Fluorescent Proteins
We utilized generators to express 2 different colors of fluorescent proteins: RFP and GFP. These parts from the registry.

Luciferase
We utilized generators to express 4 different bioluminescent colors: red, green, yellow, and orange.

Oscillating Luciferase
To create a natural beat generator, we created a light oscillating system. Unfortunately, the time scale was far too long for any practical beat generator (hypothetical 40min per beat). See Fudan 2012 Biowave for more information.
