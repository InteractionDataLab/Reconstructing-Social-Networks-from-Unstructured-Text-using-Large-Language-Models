Workshop for MakeforKids
We gave a DNA Visualization workshop to kids and parents attending MakeForKids Saturday lessons. We were scared we would have to answer the question, "What is DNA?" but we were surprised to find that most kids already had a grasp on the concept of DNA. Both parents and children were quite delighted to see the results of the DNA extraction from their cheek cells.
