Xi'An Jiaotong Liverpool University
西安交通利物浦大学
A big applause to XJTLU! We were both teams working with chromoprotein parts and expressing colorful bacteria. We discussed about creating ideal conditions for the expression of color. When we were running out of time in the lab, XJTLU donated to us their plasmids and BL21 E. Coli cells so that we could see color in our lab. Check out their wiki.
Fudan University
复旦大学
With both the 2014 team and 2015 team, we met many times to discuss how to establish an iGEM team and what are the essential skills of the lab. On July 31st, the Fudan team donated to us their kits so that we could re-transform luciferase generators and chromoprotein parts. Giving us advice from using T-vectors to ordering primers to budgeting an iGEM team, Fudan has played a crucial role in helping establish our iGEM team. You can check out their wiki.
NCTU iGEM Asia Conference
For our first presentation of our iGEM project, we attended the iGEMers Asia Conference hosted by National Chiao Tong University. To all future Asian teams: you should attend this event! We met a lot of cool people, ideas, and projects and had a great time in Hsingchu, Taiwan. Check out the NCTU Formosa wiki.
Central China iGEMers' Consortium (CCiC)
We traveled to Beijing to meet Chinese iGEM teams and present our project. We met with more teams working with the pBAD promoter as well as chromoproteins, and it was really awesome being able to discuss with them on how we could improve expression. Thank you Peking University iGEM Team for hosting! Check out the Peking team wiki
Meetup with Tongji, Jiaotong, and ITB
We hosted one of the first meetups of the summer, we talked about our developing project ideas, general organizational principles for the summer, and potential collaborations for future Human Practice events. Our friends from Tongji University traveled for a little under an hour to come to NYU Shanghai, while the Jiaotong University students travelled over two hours. The representative from ITB (Bandung Institute of Technology) flew all the way from Indonesia!
Ocean University of China
中国海洋大学
We were both working with the pBAD promoter. We had some troubles with inducing ours with the desired expression levels, and OUC helped us out by providing some of their lab characterization data of the pBAD promoter. Take a look at their wiki.
