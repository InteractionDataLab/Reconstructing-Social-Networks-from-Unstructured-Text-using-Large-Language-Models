Arduino Workshop 001(What is Arduino? How to blink a built-in LED and how to use a button to control the LED), Interactive Media Arts Lab Tour, Biology Lab Safety Training, Biology Lab Tour
26 May 2015
Skype meeting with Tristan, who is currently in the States, about our wiki page and final project prototype. Discussions on how to make editing the wiki accessible to everyone, the content of workshops, fundraising, and the coming conference at NCTU. Research on luciferase enzyme, oscillations, and rfc10.
27 May 2015
Bioluminescence presentation given by Ann. Arduino with color sensor+RGB led testing. Research about oscillating systems from previous competitions. Specifics regarding the plasmids we will be implementing. Successfully booked four flights to Taiwan for NCTU Conference in July.
28 May 2015
Skype testing with Tristan for tomorrow’s HTML workshop. Talking with Fudan University about setting up a workshop. Overall unproductive.
29 May 2015
Tristan’s Workshop on HTML via Google Hangout, Reida’s Workshop on plasmids construction, June’s Workshop on penicillin. We also got meal vouchers provided by NYU Shanghai! Hurray!
31 May 2015
We went to EXPLORIUM to hold a workshop with kids and taught them how to visualize their DNA collected from their mouth with detergent, salt, starch, and alcohol.
1 June 2015
Misya’s presentation on E.chromi. IDT representatives visited our lab and showed us how to order DNA on the website. Introduction to transformation lab with arabinose, pGLO, nutrient broth, and ampicillin. Bio majors practiced lab skills and taught Interactive Media Arts majors how to do lab. It was fun! Let’s see if our E.coli can glow tomorrow!.
2 June 2015
Spencer’s presentation on biological oscillators. The results of yesterday’s lab were kind of disappointing. GFP was not expressed and not visible under UV light. Most likely because of old agar plates. Bio majors tested our first transformation using a part from the kit (RFP generator) and made new agar plates. Bruno helped ZZ build our new color-tracking system with a web camera and Processing.
3 June 2015
Bruno, Christian, and Xiaoyue’s workshop on Virtual Reality of the inside of cell with the help of Unity 3D. Got chance to experience the bacteria world with the brand-new and exciting tool. Also, Reida’s RFP plasmid transformation showed a fluorescence in one colony! Prep work for second transformation lab including CFP, RFP, and GFP.
4 June 2015
Xiangxi’s presentation on mathematical modeling. Tristan’s Google Hangout workshop on Java/Animation in HTML. Bio majors made 54 LB agar plates with different concentrations of chloramphenicol resistances (12.5, 25, 34, 50 mg/ml).
5 June 2015
Ann’s presentation on Mini-prep. Everyone did Mini-Prep lab. DAN Quantitation of Mini-Prep we did. Xiangci talked about developing Virtual Reality Project for Human Practice with Christian. Photo shoot for our wiki landing page!
8 June 2015
Research about oscillation sequences. Meet up with Tongji (TJU), Jiaotong (SJTU), IDP students (Indonesia)
9 June 2015
Reida’s presentation on Gel Electrophoresis and Gel Extraction. Lab prep for tomorrow’s Gel Extraction lab. Building up website. Analysis of the medal criteria.
10 June 2015
Human Practice | Bioluminescence + Arduino Workshop in Kongjiang High School
Misya’s presentation on competent cells. Gel Electrophoresis Lab. Workshop about Bioluminescence, Arduino, and the integration of technology and biology in Kongjiang University as one of the series workshops that we are going to have in schools as human practice projects.
11 June 2015
Spencer’s presentation on Art & Design track. Brainstormed more details of our project. pGLO glowed! Bio majors transformed luciferase generator parts from the kit.
12 June 2015
Ann led a recap session before her 2 week leave. Lab team made competent cells. Strikingly page is up for sponsors!
Here's what we did
Lab Results for today
15 June 2015
Started working on Virtual Reality (VR). Made a lot of agar plates and transformed chromoprotein parts.
16 June 2015
RFP glows! Inoculation of chromprotein parts.
17 June 2015
Miniprep of chromoprotein parts. Nanodrop results could have been better...our average was 18.8 ng/uL. We just need a little more practice? Our IMA tech guy introduced some new ideas for our final project, and we discussed with him new ways of integrating the colorful colonies into a step sequencer.
18 June 2015
Spencer's workshop on plasmid construction. Tried to do restriction digest, but no results seen on the gel (ES). We tried following NEB protocol (not iGEM) and it also didn't show on the gel.
19 June 2015
Skype meeting with ZZ to discuss more details of final project. Another round of restriction digest (Xbal and PstI), and it worked!
23 June 2015
More development on the design of the final project. Attempt sequential digest with EcoRI and SpeI. No results.
24 June 2015
Skype meeting with one of our potential sponsors. Developed design of Processing part. Another digest, this time a double digest with EcoRI and SpeI. Digest successful!
25 June 2015
Budget and sponsorship meeting with NYU Shanghai Finance Office and Foundation. Skyped with Vivan Xu to brainstorm our sponsorship/project.
26 June 2015
Getting our member Rachel on board! Development of our interface.
26 June 2015
Coding day for ZZ and Xiangci. Pictures of plates can play notes now. First transformation of ligation products. Sohigh still working on Virtual Reality.
29 June 2015
Coding day for ZZ and Xiangci. Pictures of plates can play notes now. First transformation of ligation products. Sohigh still working on Virtual Reality.
30 June 2015
Lab work presentations with professors. Processing code development. More talks with potential sponsors. Plates photo booth set up.
1 July 2015
Coding coding coding coding. Testing music components. Obtaining linearized backbone through gel electrophoresis and gel extraction.
2 July 2015
Google cardboards arrived! More progress on sponsorship and details of our final interactive genetically inspired music production installation.
3 July 2015
Laser cut a tube rack sample. Lab team did more work on digests and ligations. VR team built a 3D plasmid model. Two official donation agreements sent out. Starting initial wiki design.
6 July 2015
Presentation for the professors on all the stuff besides Biology. Project interface designed in Illustrator. VR team built a skybox in Unity. Made a tube rack prototype.
7 July 2015
Preparation for the iGEM Conference in NCTU. Settled down many cool Arduino stuff that we are going to get from DFRobot. VR tested our Unity project on an Android phone. An academic debate in bio lab over troubleshooting procedures for an unsuccessful ligation. New digestion of promoter and blue chromoprotein with lower reaction volumes.
8 July 2015
Taiwan planning. Tube rack processing code. VR team successfully ran our Unity file on an Android phone! The full construct with Promoter-RBS-Lime green chromoprotein-Terminator grew! But no color seen...
9 July 2015
Planning for Taiwan Conference trip is done! More sponsorship letters sent out.
10 July 2015
No colonies for RFP, YFP, CFP, GFP parts. Why? Luciferase parts successfully transformed into HB101 but still no color seen. Animation work for NCTU Conference begins.
13 July 2015
A lot of transformations. Tested the usb webcame modules. Interviewed bio-artist Vivian Xu, DJ Benjamin Bacon about biology, art, step sequencers, and experimental music. Our Strikingly page made it to the Strikingly discover page! http://igemnyushanghai.strikingly.com
