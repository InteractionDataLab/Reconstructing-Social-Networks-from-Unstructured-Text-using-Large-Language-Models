Jungseog Kang: For general project support, plasmid construction advising, and biology knowledge.
Marianne Petit: For administrative support from the Interactive Media Arts deparment.
Matthew Belanger: For administrative support from the Interactive Media Arts deparment.
Shanghai iGEM Teams: For teaching us about what iGEM is, how it works, and how to make a successful team. A shoutout to Fudan, Tongji, and Jiaotong University 2014 and 2015 for being part of that process.
Lab Support
Wenshu Li 李文姝: For helping us order things, biology knowledge, and making sure we kept safe practices in the bio lab.
Lin Jin 金琳: For teaching us how to work in the biology lab.
Xiaobo Cao 曹晓波: For making the sure the biology lab remained functional.
Jungseog Kang: Helped provide suggestions for procedures when results came out negative.
Misya, Reida, Spencer, Rachel, Ann: For dealing with all the frustrations of lab work.
Fundraising Support
Li Yuzhong 俞立中: For helping us connect with sponsors. He's the super nice guy on the left.

Aven Zhou 周乐: For his help in using the lasercutter and 3D printers.
Helen Wu: For her help with checking-out equipment and using the lasercutter.
Xiangci, ZZ, Sohigh: Team members most involved in this aspect of the project.
Wiki Support
Tristan Armitage: Class of 2018, couldn't be with us in Shanghai, but committed to the team in finishing the wiki. Thanks Tristan!
Ann Yang: Didn't realize a wiki took so much work.
Biobrick Parts
Cambridge University iGEM 2009/2010: We used parts made from Cambridge University iGEM teams (chromoproteins and luciferase) to create the colors in our lab.
Fudan University iGEM 2012: We used their constructs to attempt a light osciillating system.
Fudan University iGEM 2015: When we ran out of luciferase generators, the Fudan team kindly donated to us their iGEM kits. They also helped a lot in teaching us about primer design and creating plasmids that work.
Xi'An Jiaotong Liverpool University 2015: We used their parts to create color in the lab. They literally drove to Shanghai with a box of dry ice and cells already transformed with chromoprotein expressing plasmids. We were blown away by their kindness. Thanks XJTLU!
DNA Sequences
iGEM Kit: for giving us most of the parts we wanted to work with this summer.
Integrated DNA Technologies: For their gBlocks which provided us our chromoprotein constructs.
Sangon 生工: For sequencing our plasmids and creating our primers.
