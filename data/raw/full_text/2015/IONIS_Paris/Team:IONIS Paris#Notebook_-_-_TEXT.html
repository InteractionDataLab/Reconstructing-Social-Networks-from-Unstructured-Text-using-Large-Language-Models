The band for the third well is good. WE GOT IT !!!!!
Induction of BBa_K325909 and BBa_K1159001 with a solution of arabinose 1%, and a solution of IPTG 1 mM for T7-Nanoluc (should correspond to the effect of a constitutive promoter like T7). Under these conditions, light intensity of T7-nanoluc was 1,2 time higher than the BBa_K1159001.
Effect of the concentration of IPTG inducer to the light intensity of T7-nanoluc part. While the concentration of IPTG does not exceed 1 mM, the light intensity remains low.
Effect of the concentration of arabinose inducer to the light intensity of BBa_K1159001 part. Light intensity is linked to inducer concentration however over 1% of arabinose (final concentration), the intensity not rise anymore.

Liquid culture of bacteria transformed with pSB1C3-nanoluc (x5)
Liquid culture on 96 wells plate
When 0,6 < OD600 < 0,8, induction with arabinose or IPTG Incubate 5h at 30°C; for BBa_K325909, measure the kinetic during the 5h of induction and take the maximum value
Add 50µL of NanoGlow substrate (Promega) for 50 uL of bacteria
Measure kinetic over 120 min and take maximum value for culture with BBa_K1159001 and T7-nanoluc

Measurement of the OD600 of liquid culture
When the OD600 has reached 0.6 or more, the volume of culture has been divided into 3 erlenmeyers:
1 erlenmeyer without light exposition, 37°C
1 erlenmeyer with light exposition, 37°C
1 erlenmeyer with light exposition, room temperature
Measurement of the OD600 every hour
3 culture on 5have shown a bacterial development
Colony - A6
Colony - A8
Colony - F1
All colonies exhibits same profile under same condition of light exposition and temperature. When the temperature is favorable for a bacterial development, the light activation of pDawn leading to the production of toxin is weak and do not impact a lot the growth of the population of bacteria.      But at room temperature (RT°), the induction for protein synthesis is high enough to stop bacterial development
Two things lack to this experiment:
A longer time to measure if the population of bacteria could really decrease
A control at room temperature without light exposition to compare it evolution of OD 600 to the grey curve

Results
After the last Gibson reaction we have get red colonies that should correspond to bacteria transformed with pSB1C3-RFP (which should be impossible after the gel migration and purification). So we analyzed the content of the gel extraction and we saw that the tube only had linearized backbone. About pDawn III PCR 2, the migration of 5 µl from the gel extraction of PCR products have shown that there is not a high quantity of DNA material, not enough for a Gibson assembly…

Low melting point gel
Sample: 10 µl of PCR product+ 2 µl of loading dye (6x)
Ladder: 1 µl of 2log ladder (1µg/µl) + 2 µl of loading dye (6x) + 9 µl water MQ

Expected results
Results
We get expected bands about 200 bp with a good intensity meaning DNA have been highly amplified without contamination.
Purification of PRC product
Aim: purify and concentrate amplified DNA
Use of a QIAquick PCR Purification kit and using a microcentrifuge.
For step 1: add 5 volumes of PB buffer for 1 volume of PCR product
200 µl of PB buffer added into both coupled of tube with 40 µl of remaining PCR product
Mix of same PCR product together into a new tube
Put mixes into their own purification column
Then, we followed the protocol from the supplier
At the end of the purification, we get 1 tube “PCR1, VVD1, 07/05/2015” and another one “PCR1, VVD2, 07/05/2015”
Stored at -20°C.

Aim: plasmid purification from transformed bacteria
Protocol from MO BIO, UltraClean® Standard
Mini plasmid Prep Kit l
4 plates with Ampicillin
Dilution of the glycerol in water
Percentage in mass not in volume
Ex: 50% glycerol solution 50 g Glycerol + 50 g water (mQ)
Then filtration with vacuum pump
Glycerol preparation & Glycerol Stock
Aim: store the transformed bacteria for later use
Weight 50 g of pure Glycerol
Weight 50 g of distilled water
Mix and homogenize the solution
Filtration with vacuum pump, then close the bottle under PSM
Under PSM class II: put 1ml of liquid culture in a 1,5 ml sterile tube (pDusk, pDawn, psB1C3, VVD)
Centrifugate 1mL of liquid culture 4000 rpm, 5 min
Remove and discard the supernatant
Under PSM: resuspend with 0,5 ml of LB without antibiotics
Add 0,5 ml of glycerol 50% (25% final)
Homogenize
Transfer in an identified cryotube and store at -80°C
