ATTRIBUTIONS & ACKNOLEDGEMENT
Attributions & Acknowledgements
We couldn't achieve our project without the help of the following! We warmly thank them for believing in us!
Companies
Kickstarter: a crowdfunding platform
Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform based in the United States.The company’s stated mission is to help bring creative projects to life. Kickstarter has reportedly received more than $1.5 billion in pledges from 7.8 million backers to fund 200,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.
We warmly thank all of our supporters. We didn't think that we would achieve our €3,000 objective. With the help of 69 contributors, we did.
Fluigent: a microfluidic expert
Fluigent develops, manufactures and commercializes innovative fluid handling solutions for a variety of rapidly growing applications where fluid control is critical.
Fluigent is our partner for this project, its scientific team shared some of their knowledge and expertise with our team in order to achieve our Bio-Console. A special thanks to Lionel Matthys, for supporting our work and for making the connection between Fluigent and our team.
We also thank MicroFactory which design our microfluidic chip. Microfactory is a spin-off from ESPCI, more specifically from the MMN Lab (Microfluidics, Microelectromechanical systems - MEMS and Nanostructures laboratory) lead by Professor Patrick Tabeling. Its mission is to provide its clients with first class solutions in microfluidics and related services that can translate in outstanding value creation for them.
NEB: New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs (NEB) produces and supplies recombinant and native enzyme reagents for the life science research.NEB also provides free access to research tools such as REBASE, InBASE, and Polbase.
NEB is one of our partner as it provided some reagent kit for Gibson Assembly and PCR as well as some laboratory material.
Qiagen
Qiagen is a provider of sample and assay technologies for molecular diagnostics, applied testing, academic and pharmaceutical research.
Qiagen is one of our partner as it provided some reagent kit for Gibson Assembly and PCR as well as some laboratory material.
Glowee
Glowee is a biolighting living system that both does not consume electricity and does not emit light pollution.
Glowee's technology is based on bioluminescence, the natural superpower of some micro-organisms to create light.     It has been thought to tackle the current issues faced by the urban lighting market.
Schools
We thank firstly the whole IONIS group for allowing us to represent it at the iGEM competition as this team is the first one created bearing this name.
Sup'Biotech
Sup'Biotech is a French private engineering school created in 2003 located in Villejuif close to Paris.     Sup'Biotech is specialized in the field of biotechnology. The school delivers a 5-year program split in two parts: the first three years correspond to a bachelor's degree in biotechnology and the last two years to expert in biotechnology
We warmly thank Vanessa Proux, the director of Sup'Biotech for allowing us to create this team and achieve this project to its whole. Moreover, her administrative and organizational help regarding laboratory availability was really precious. Finally we are thankful also for her financial help.
We also render thanks to Estelle Mogensen (PhD in plant pathologies) who helped us during our laboratory sessions as she is the head of the Sup'Biotech laboratories. We couldn't perform any experiments without her and Baptiste Favard allowing us using the laboratories.
Epita
The École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées (the "Graduate School of Computer Science and Advanced Technologies"), more commonly known as EPITA is a French education institution specialized in the field of computer science and software engineering.
Epita and its director Joel Courtois, provided really helpful advice and financial support, we are thankful for all this help.
E-artSup
E-Artsup is a French private university created in 2001 and specialized in digital creativity and multimedia.
We are grateful to E-artSup and its director Nicolas Becqueret for their great and useful help in the crowdfunding campaign regarding our communication.
Institutions
Uni Freiburg
The University of Freiburg is a public research university located in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
We are grateful for all the laboratory material and plasmids provided by this University through one of our supervisor Samuel Juillot currently finishing his PhD there. Without this help, we couldn't have achieved any part of the project!
The French Embassy in the United States
We warmly thank the French Embassy in the United States for supporting our project, believing in it and for supplying financial funding in order for us to achieve our goals.
The Department of Seine-et-Marne
We are grateful to the Department of Seine-et-Marne for supplying financial funding in order for us to achieve our goals and also for supporting our project.
The Bio Club
The Bio Club is a Sup’Biotech association, created in 2013 by Matthieu Da Costa, supported by Gilles Defrel and Johanna Chesnel.        Thanks to different and dynamic approaches, its goal is to facilitate the understanding and the promotion of biotechnology among students and the general public.       The Bio Club is built on a strong multidisciplinary and willingness of students to actively participate to the expansion of biotechnology.
We are grateful and warmly thank the Bio Club, for being the birthplace of the IONIS iGEM team and have brought its values and willing to the IONIS iGEM 2015 Project.
Individuals
Our advisors
We warmly thank our advisor Guillaume Mercy who participated in previous iGEM editions and currently making his PhD at the Pasteur Institute, helped us on our strategy of our experimentations and who supervised several laboratory sessions.
We greatly thank Pierre Parutto, who participated also in previous iGEM editions for sharing with us his experience and knowledge of the iGEM competition.
Our supervisors
We greatly thank Samuel Juillot, for all his help with the laboratory reagents and  for providing the plasmids we needed.
Moreover, we are grateful to Frank Yates, professor at Sup'Biotech and PhD in immunology for his advice all along our project and his recommendations regarding the engineering systems.
