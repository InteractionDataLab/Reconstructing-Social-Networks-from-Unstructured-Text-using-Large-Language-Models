Results of the last transformation
2 red colonies (which is weird)
Liquid culture for amplification
PCR fragments quantification
Expected results
Results
We get expected bands but, as for second PCRs of VVD and YN155 fragments, bands 2 time heavier than expected bands appeared

Results
After the last Gibson reaction we have get red colonies that should correspond to bacteria transformed with pSB1C3-RFP (which should be impossible after the gel migration and purification). So we analyzed the content of the gel extraction and we saw that the tube only had linearized backbone. About pDawn III PCR 2, the migration of 5 µl from the gel extraction of PCR products have shown that there is not a high quantity of DNA material, not enough for a Gibson assembly…
