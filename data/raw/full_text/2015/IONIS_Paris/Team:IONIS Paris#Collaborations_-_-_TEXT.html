Collaboration
Explain your project in 1 minutes
Introduction
As this year the main goal of the IONIS iGEM team was to popularized the Synthetic Biology, we have challenged other iGEM teams and asked them to create an one minute video introducing their project in the simplest way.        As well, during the French meeting in July, we came with our camera and recorded the other French teams.
