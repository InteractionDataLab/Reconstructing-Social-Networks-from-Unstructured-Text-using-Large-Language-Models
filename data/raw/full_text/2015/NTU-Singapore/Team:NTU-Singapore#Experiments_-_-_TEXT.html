Competent Cell Preparation
Material
LB Agar Plate
LB Medium
0.1M CaCl2-MgCl2 (20mM CaCl2 and 80mM MgCl2) Solution
0.1M CaCl2-15% Glycerol Solution
Procedures
Strain to be prepared competent is streaked on LB agar plate and cultured overnight.
Pick single colony and culture in 2ml LB medium overnight.
Add 1ml overnight culture to 100ml LB medium.
Incubate culture for about 3h, until OD600 reading reaches 0.4.
Transfer culture into 50ml Falcon tube and chill on ice for 10min.
Centrifuge chilled culture at 4000rpm, 4°C for 10min.
Discard supernatant and resuspend using ice-chilled 0.1M CaCl2-MgCl2 solution 30ml. Place on ice for 30min.
Centrifuge culture at 4000rpm, 4°C for 5min.
Discard supernatant and resuspend using ice-chilled 0.1M CaCl2-15% glycerol solution.
Distribute the resuspended solution to 1.5ml centrifuge tube at 200ul per tube.
Store cell at -80°C.
Miniprep
Material
Axygen Miniprep Kit

Procedures
Centrifuge overnight cell culture at 4700rpm for 6min.
Discard supernatant.
Add 200ul FAPD1 buffer to Falcon tube and resuspend cell pellet.
Transfer all liquid to labelled centrifuge tube.
Add 200ul FAPD2 buffer and gently invert tube for 10 times. DON'T vortex!
Add FAPD3 buffer and invert tube 10 times immediately.
Centrifuge at full speed for 5min.
Pour supernatant into filter column, spin down at full speed for 30s. In case of low expected DNA yield, flow-through is transferred back into column and spun down at different rpm.
Discard flow-through, add 400ul W1 buffer, and centrifuge at full speed for 30s.
Discard flow-through, add 600ul Wash Buffer buffer, and centrifuge at full speed for 30s.
Discard flow-through and centrifuge to dry column at full speed for 3min.
Replace column in 1.5ml centrifuge tube.
Add 40ul Elution Buffer and let it stand for 2min.
Centrifuge at full speed for 1min.
Perform Nanodrop to determine DNA concentration.
Double Digestion
Material
Fermentas FastDigest Restriction Enzymes and Buffers
PCR Strip Tubes
Procedures
Add 2ul 10X FastDigest Green buffer to PCR tube.
Add an amount containing 1ug of DNA sample. If DNA concentration is <62.5ng/ul, add 16ul.
Add 1ul Endonuclease each.
For totle volumn<20ul, add water to make up 20ul.
Incubate at 37°C for 30min.
electrophoresis
Material
Agarose
Fermentas 6X Loading Dye
ThermoFisher 1kb PLUS DNA Labber
10,000X GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain
Procedures
Prepare 1%(w/v) agarose-TAE solution and add 10,000X GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain.
Dissolve agarose by heating the solution with a microwave oven. Pour the fully dissolved agarose solution in mold, insert comb and let solidify at room temperature.
After agarose gel is ready, remove comb and transfer the gel into electrophoresis machine.
Add TAE to immerse the gel.
Load sample into gel and run electrophoresis for 40min at a voltage 10X length of gel in cm.
Gel extraction
Material
ThermoFisher Gel Extraction Kit
Procedures
Excise the desired band from gel with 4 straight cuts at each side of the band. Place the band in a 1.5ml tube.
Add 1:1 weight(mg):volumn(ul) Binding Buffer.
Incubate at 55°C for about 10min, until gel is fully dissolved.
Transfer dissolved solution to filter column, centrifuge at 6000rpm for 1min.
Repeat last step a few more times, with gradually increasing rotating speed until full speed.
Discard flow-through, add 700ul Wash Buffer and centrifuge at full speed for 1min.
Discard flow-through and centrifuge to dry column at full speed for 1min.
Replace column in 1.5ml centrifuge tube.
Add 30ul Elution Buffer and let it stand for 2min.
Centrifuge at full speed for 1min.
Store DNA at -20°C if not using it immediately.
