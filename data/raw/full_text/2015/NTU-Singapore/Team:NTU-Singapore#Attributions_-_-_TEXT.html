Our Team
Assistant Professor Tan Meng How
Assembled the team and met with all the team members every week to provide guidance and set research directions Designed the primers for our RBS mutations as well as initiating our lactate metabolism project.
Assistant Professor Zheng Jie
Provided guidance on the computational modelling of Shewanella's metabolic network
Zhang Lei
Ph.D. student in the Tan Lab. Taught the team members all the necessary microbiology and molecular biology techniques in order for the team to carry out the project. Guided the team on all the growth curve measurements as well as the microbial fuel cell (MFC) measurements.
Yin Yuan
Participated in brainstorming the project and performing experiments. Involved in constructing the team's wiki and conducting public outreach. Key person in putting together our survey.
Tracy Koh
Participated in brainstorming the project and performing experiments. Took overnight measurements, such as MFC readings and growth curve measurements. Initiated and led the educational talk at River Valley High School.
Yuan Yuan
Participated in brainstorming the project and performing experiments. The key person to clone all our constructs into the pSB1C3 backbone plasmid for shipment.
Yang Ming
Participated in brainstorming the project and performing experiments. Night owl who took overnight measurements with Tracy. She also drew the portraits of the team members. In addition, she interviewed GMAC officials for human practices as well as analyzed our survey.
Ooi Kean Hean
Participated in brainstorming the project and performing experiments. The key person for taking measurements on the different mutant RBS constructs. Worked with Abhishek on the growth curve measurements of Shewanella in the presence of heavy metals. He also helped to build our wiki.
Nicholas Choo
Largest contributor to our human practices section. Also helped in general laboratory experiments and helped brainstorm our Shezensor project.
Chong Bao Yi
Participated in brainstorming the project. Helped in some laboratory experiments and worked with Nicholas on our human practices. She provided reports on the various interviews for our documentation.
Hao Ting
Performed some computational modelling and simulation and contributed to building our Wiki.
Ming Jie
Biggest contributor to our modelling section. Our mathematics guru who is trying all sorts of ways to analyze the Shewanella's metabolic network in silico.

Shi Shuobo
Previous participant of iGEM and now a postdoc in A*STAR, Singapore. Provided guidance on how to navigate the iGEM competition.
Abhishek
Ph.D. student in the Tan Lab. Provided guidance on how to study bacteria's responses to different environmental pollutants.
Bobby Chow Wai Hong
Provide advice and technical support for our Shezensor catridge. Bobby was very helpfull and always hoped to provide the best for our competition!!
Mia Mia Kin
Provided guidance on how to use Tecan M200 plate reader.
Hugo Schmidt
