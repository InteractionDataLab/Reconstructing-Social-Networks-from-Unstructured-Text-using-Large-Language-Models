Objective
Our main objective is to propose an optimized model which involves both Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) algorithm and a set of Monod equations that is capable of predicting accurately the metabolism of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 by minimizing the errors i.e. residuals between our predicted and observed results for 4 key growth measurements: Biomass, Acetate, Lactate and Pyruvate from the model while also optimizing electron activity simultaneously for the design of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 powered MFCs. Kinetic Monod models have been shown recently to be extremely successful in modelling microbial growth dynamics over cultivation period but lack the ability to determine the flux distributions for more rigorous mathematical computations. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) has also been widely used to determine flux distributions in order to maximize an objective function (e.g. growth rate) through linear optimization by maintaining their stoichiometric mass balance while allowing varying reaction constraints. However FBA also lacks the machinery to account for transient metabolic states of the studied cells since it only assumes complete steady states. This means that behaviours of cells which are realistically expected to adjust its metabolic fluxes constantly in order to response to constant changes in environmental conditions, cannot be comprehensively and realistically modelled by solely FBA, hence our motivation to propose an integration between two successful methods to overcome these problems. We first consider Proposition 1.1 for a formal introduction of the kinetic Monod model. In our study, the chosen metabolic model for our proposed optimization is iSO783 [1] of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Initially used to understand how Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 utilizes its resources for metabolism, iSO783 which was constructed to summarize a network of metabolic reactions comprising of 774 reactions, 783 genes and 634 unique metabolites for all involved cell components is now commonly used in simulation studies in FBA-related studies [1].
Monod Model
Proposition 1.1: Consider an initial 4 reactions that was developed to describe 4 main growth components in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1: cell growth, lactate uptake or production, acetate and pyruvate production or reuse,
Where X is the biomass (in g DCW/L), LACT, ACT, PYR are lactate, acetate and pyruvate concentrations respectively (in mmol/L), μL, μA, μP are the specific growth rates (in h-1) on lactate, acetate and pyruvate respectively, ke is the endogenous metabolism rate constant  (in h-1), Yx/L, YX/A, YX/P are biomass yield coefficients (in DCW/mol substrate) of lactate, acetate and pyruvate respectively, rP,L and rA,L are the production rates of pyruvate and acetate from lactate (in mmol/L/h) of acetate and pyruvate from lactate respectively, rA,P is the production rate of acetate from pyruvate, S(t-tL ) is the dimensionless Heaviside unit-step time delay function to describe a lag phase L during cultivation before actual growth which was discovered in [2] s.t.
While the specific cell growth rate can be summarized in the next 3 Monod equations:
Where μL, μA, μP are the maximum growth rates (in h-1) on lactate, acetate and pyruvate respectively, and Ks,l , Ks,a and Ks,p are Monod constants (mmol/L) for lactate, acetate and pyruvate respectively. The acetate and pyruvate production rates are assumed to be proportional to the biomass as expressed below by the last 3 equations:
Where kal and kpl are rate constants of acetate and pyruvate production from lactate respectively (in L⋅(h⋅g DCW)-1) and kap are rate constants of acetate production from pyruvate (in L⋅(h⋅g DCW)-1). In total, there are 14 kinetic parameters in 10 equations in the kinetic Monod model.
To begin, we intend to estimate a set of these 14 kinetic parameters representing influential growth factors that could contribute to the metabolism of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 so that the simulation can most closely resembles the actual metabolism. This is done based on comparison of our simulation against 3 independent replicates of observed experimental values for the 4 individual measurements: Biomass (g DCW/ L), Pyruvate, Acetate and Lactate (mmol/L) over a time span of 34 hours of metabolic activity [2] with the fore-mentioned SOA as follows:
In order to do so, we would first consider an initial set of values of the parameters for optimization in order to estimate the final set of values of the parameters which can produce a simulation that most closely resembles the observed values as Table R1A-1D by considering multiple sets determined from a number of repeated random sampling over a range of constrained values for each parameter uniformly from the initial set for our model for comparison (referred to here as Monte Carlo).
The value of the residuals (to be minimized) will be the summation of all the differences between predicted and observed results for Biomass, Acetate, Lactate and Pyruvate. Since the 4 different measurements have different scales, we normalize each differences with the maximum value of observed result from that corresponding measurement as shown below for all i observations:
From our simulation the results of the estimated parameters for growth factors summarized in Table R2 suggests that growth rate dependent on lactate, denoted by μmax,L, is much higher than the growth rate which depends on pyruvate, denoted by μmax,P or on acetate, denoted by μmax,A, indicating that lactate is the major carbon substrate for biomass growth. This result was confirmed in many other studies and simulations [2, 3, 4].
Microbial Fuel Cells
MFCs are designed to use micro-organisms as catalysts to transform chemical energy from organic compounds to electrical energy through enzymatic reactions that are associated with their respiration and metabolism [5, 6]. Hence one obvious advantage with MFCs is that they can generate clean and combustion-less electricity directly from mass of organic matter [7]. The second advantage is the natural diversity of micro-organisms available to the design of MFCs as compared to conventional chemical fuel cells. In a typical MFC set-up, the micro-organisms are placed in the compartment with the anodes and uses their biomass for growth while producing electrons and protons with their metabolism. The electrons produced can then be transported out of the cells to the anode with specific redox mediators or by some substrates which are reduced in the process while protons are diffused through the electrolyte to the cathode where is oxidized to water. Since Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is capable of respiring using various organic compounds and reducing exogenous chemicals such as iron, manganese [9, 10, 12] and chromium [12], it can potentially generate electricity by utilizing extracellular anodes of similar materials as terminal electron acceptors in MFCs.
The respiration of extracellular solid metallic electrodes by MR-1 requires a reliable molecular pathway for transferring electrons from intracellular electron carriers such as NADH and quinones across double-layered membranes of MR-1 in order to reach the electrode. Such a molecular pathway is named as an extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathway where the double-layered membranes are named separately as inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM). A study by Shi et al. [13] had identified the five primary protein components involved in any EET pathway: CymA, MtrA, MtrB, MtrC and OmcA (denoted respectively as SO4591, SO1776, SO1777, SO1778 and SO1779 in iSO783) in MR-1 denoted as a Mtr pathway while a recent study by Sturm et al. [15] has further identified small tetraheme cytochromes known as STC/ CctA and flavo-cytochrome c (FccA) proteins which are also involved in the same EET process. Clearly, these studies shows that in order for MR-1 to effectively conduct electricity, its Mtr pathway must work effectively as an electron conductor in order to link the IM quinone pool to the extracellular electrode by a series of electron-transfer reactions between a set of reliable protein components in OM.
Since there are many proposed theoretical models in literature under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, in our study we only consider our MFCs set-up to harness electricity from the electrons using a derivative of EET, the direct electron transfer (DET) method for partial aerobic with anaerobic growth from applications of similar concepts of DET in EET transfer as summarized by Kouzuma [17]. To understand our motivation, we consider the electron transfer to the anode to be carried out by IM bound c-type cytochromes denoted as CymA protein, which act as the first electron transfer capacity to shuttle the electrons from the IM quinone pool to the next decademe c type cytochrome protein at MtrA bound in OM. These multi-heme proteins, existing in the cell membrane of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, have also been shown to be chiefly responsible for reducing poisonous heavy metal ions in their living environment through their carefully designed metabolism [18]. MtrA is then involved in the electron transfer to MtrC and OmcA by forming a stable configuration with β-barrel protein MtrB and OM bound c-type cytochromes MtrC on OM at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 in order to support the electron exchange through OM to the last OM-bound c-type cytochromes OmcA which then finally releases the electrons to the electrode [19, 20, 22].
Fig. R3. Proposed extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways (Mtr pathway) in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 involved in direct EET or DET mode [17]: OM refers to outer membrane; IM refers to inner membrane; MQH2 refers to general reduced form of menaquinone or also known as menaquinol 7, i.e. mql7, in iSO783; MQ refers to general oxidized form of menaquinone or also known as menaquinone 7, mqn7, in iSO783.
In DET mode because MFCs are designed to conduct electricity by continuously extracting electrons from all the participating membrane-bound proteins in Mtr pathway to the anode, extra metabolic pressure on specific cellular activities of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 may exist in order to maintain the electricity. Since it is believed that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 contains 42 different types of cytochrome c proteins possibly interacting with one another [23], a recent simulation [16] have identified that the surplus flux of the reduced cytochrome c required in order to maintain that electricity in DET mode can be attributed to reaction 175 (ID: CYOO2) in iSO783. Furthermore, since electron transfer from CymA and MtrA involves reactions directed by either CctA or FccA where FccA is involved in only anaerobic conditions, hence one future direction from our research could be that electron transfer in the presence of both CctA and FccA under mixed aerobic-anaerobic growth conditions could be faster than in the presence of only FccA activity in fully aerobic growth.
Integrate Kinetic Model with FBA
Previously, an integration of an optimized dual-objective dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA) model with a set of Kinetic Monod equations to simulate an optimal growth rate with appropriate lactate, acetate and pyruvate consumption or production was proposed [2]. Here, we would propose a more comprehensive method of triple-objective Monod-constrained dFBA model in order to accommodate a more complex optimization of three objectives: growth rate, enzyme efficiency and electron transfer.
Given we have an initial value of growth rate determined with a set of Monod equations denoted as μMonod and a M×N stoichiometric matrix S which summarizes all N stoichiometric reactions of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with M metabolites, our new triple-objective dFBA model must now be able to determine a new optimized growth rate μFBA, a new set of flux values v=(v1,…,vi,…,vN) (each in unit: mmol/g DCW/h) for all N reactions considered in the metabolism and K∈{1,…,N} for some Kth reaction such that,
Where the first minimization problem ensures that the differences between the predicted growth rates for both FBA and kinetic Monod models are kept minimal by a constraint and then the second minimization problem ensures that there is minimal trade-off between three maximization: growth rate, electron activity and enzyme efficiency.
To understand how the 2nd optimization problem works, we consider three objectives when determining an appropriate objective equation for it: (1) an objective representing the maximization of growth rate since micro-organism are experimentally proven to have evolved to optimize their metabolism to achieve maximal biomass production [23], (2) an objective representing the maximization of the production of an overflow flux of desirable reducing chemicals which can restore the redox balance of electron extraction process to support electricity activity in MFC and (3) an objective representing the maximization of enzyme efficiency by reducing the sum of all fluxes in the metabolic network so as to maintain minimal stress on the system [10]. Since previous simulation studies have shown that cytochrome-C production shares a general inverse relationship with growth rate [16], this means that the triple-objective optimization would have to involve the use of a Pareto-optimal space to determine an appropriate balance of the three possibly conflicting objectives in the modelling [24]. In our study, we do so by varying two weights w1,w2 associated with each objective over the range of [0, 1] in the following expression:
Here we consider VN where N=775 in our algorithm as the growth rate, VN determined by our FBA model as μFBA and VK as the targeted surplus flux for some optimum reaction K in iSO783 that produces the reducing compounds required to support maximum electron activity as μK. In DET, we consider our K=175 which represents the flux for reaction CYOO2 involved in the reduction of a type of cytochrome c protein (denoted as Cco (SO2361 and SO2362 and SO2363 and SO2364) or Cyco (SO4606 and SO4607 and SO4609) in iSO783). gK is included in the expression and is set as 0.8869g/mmol which is the molar mass of a cytochrome c protein in order to ensure that w2 can be interpreted directly as the relative contribution of the reducing equivalent’s fluxes to the combined objective without any unit concerns [16].
Following iSO783 for our dFBA model, our stoichiometric matrix S would have 774 stoichiometric reactions with M=634 metabolites with an additional biomass rate equation, making it N=775 reactions. Furthermore, our optimization carried out on the 775 reactions would be done over the same set of range of maximum and minimum values given by the constraints summarized in iSO783 used also in several other studies [1, 2, 16] except with a few distinct modifications where the maximum and minimum rate of lactate consumption, acetate and pyruvate production were instead set according to the rate determined by the kinetic Monod model over 408 time points spanning 34 hours. The values of lactate, acetate and pyruvate rates were chosen to simulate the optimal growth of MR-1 based on the kinetic Monod model over 408 time points where each time point is assumed to be an independent pseudo-steady state under SOA.
Lastly in order to investigate the influence an optimized CYOO2 reaction has on the Mtr pathway in the simulation, we allow unconstrained flow in all reactions directly involved in the 5 primary protein components: CymA, MtrA, MtrB, MtrC and OmcA in the Mtr pathway. Under partial aerobic with anaerobic growth, these reactions are reaction 263, 264, 272, 273, 464, 465, 766 and 767 belonging to iSO783 with corresponding reaction IDs: FER3, FER4, FRD8, FRD9, MNOR, MNOR2, URNR3 and URNR4.
These reactions can be summarized as follows:
Furthermore, other reactions involving in fumarate uptake, continued to be constrained in order to ensure that oxygen is the main electron acceptor in the partial aerobic with anaerobic state since fumarate is considered to be the main electron acceptor in anaerobic growth of MR-1 [13]. Since these reactions are all forward and irreversible, we set their unconstrained flow as a range of [0, 100000]. Hence, flux activity in all these reactions is expected to indicate that CYOO2 is involved indirectly on Mtr pathway in our simulation as predicted by Mao [6].
We also introduce three methods of measurements to assess our new model: (1) Current Output, (2) Coulombic Efficiency and as described in the following propositions:
Proposition 2.1: Consider 1 Coulomb unit is equal to 1 Ampere in 1 second i.e. 1C=1A⋅1s and have 6.241×1018 electrons i.e. 1C=6.241×1018 e- and furthermore 1 mol=6.02×1023 electrons according to Avogadro’s constant, then we have Faraday’s constant F as follows:
Since
And so one flux unit given as mmol/g/h can be converted into A/g i.e.
Proposition 2.2: Given sufficient amount of lactate and assuming μ_output denoted here as the flux for the reaction involved in the last protein component OmcA, is fully involved in electron transfer, since lactate is the primary substrate used for the metabolism in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [14], then we can measure the efficiency of electricity generated per lactate unit consumed by defining an efficiency indicator denoted as Coulombic Efficiency i.e. CE that can be used to quantify the performance of MFCs such that
When anaerobic growth condition is allowed, not all lactate would be oxidised fully. Instead a small proportion of lactate is oxidised partially by MR-1 as expressed below
Where there is only a contribution of 4e-. Since full lactate oxidation reaction which can be expressed as
Then each lactate should be able hold up to 12e- and so by partial or full oxidation, any lactate oxidation must be able to contribute up to a maximum of 12e- [11]. In our study here, only reaction 464 and 465 (ID: MNOR and MNOR2) are directly involved in OmcA. Hence to account for the interaction between both reactions, we determine μ_output as the minimum of the fluxes for the 2 reactions i.e. inf⁡{μMNOR,μMNOR2}. The calculation also assumes electron exchange between the cell and the electrode is 100% efficient.
Under Partial Aerobic with Anaerobic Growth
Indeed based on Fig R5 and Fig R6, our simulation suggests that our new optimized triple-objective Monod-constrained dFBA model is able to fit well with the experimentally determined values of growth rate, lactate consumption, acetate and pyruvate production of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [2] and with the proposed flux for growth rate, lactate, acetate and pyruvate production simulated by the kinetic Monod model, indicating that our new model is both a fairly reliable simulation and constrained effectively to the kinetic Monod model. This can be seen in Fig R5 where the time profile plot of the predicted rates for the new dFBA model denoted by the red line overlapped exactly along the time profile plot for the original kinetic Monod model.
Fig. R5. (From Upper Left to Lower Right) Time profiles of rates of (1) Biomass growth, (2) Lactate consumption, (3) Acetate production and (4) Pyruvate production over 34 hours (A) simulated by the triple-objective dFBA for DET mode in red line and (B) simulated by the original kinetic Monod model in blue line.
Fig. R6. (From Upper Left to Lower Right) Time profiles of (1) Biomass, (2) Lactate, (3) Acetate and (4) Pyruvate amounts over 34 hours simulated by the triple-objective dFBA for DET mode.
Furthermore on Fig R7, evidence from our simulation also suggests that the maximum flux for reaction CYOO2 to support the redox imbalance from the electron transfer in the Mtr pathway can only be maintained at a maximum of 70mmol/g/h if we were to consistently maintain the growth rate, lactate, acetate and pyruvate uptake rate of MR-1 according to the kinetic Monod model. Hence the corresponding maximum current output from MR-1 for our model can be determined to be 1.870A by assuming the entire flux of CYOO2 supporting the redox imbalance would be the full current output.
Results in Fig R8A and R8B also support suggestions in [16] that even though the cytochrome c production attributed to reaction CYOO2 is involved in other protein components Cco (denoted as SO2361 and SO2362 and SO2363 and SO2364 in iSO783) and Cyco (denoted as SO4606 and SO4607 and SO4609 in iSO783), it is still indirectly involved in the Mtr pathway. This is illustrated in Fig R8A and R8B that as the non-zero flux for CYOO2 begins after 6 hours, there is also corresponding non-zero fluxes for CymA (denoted as SO4591), MtrA (SO1777), MtrB (SO1776), MtrC (SO1778) and OmcA (SO1779) protein-linked Mtr pathway reactions FER3, FER4, FRD8, FRD9, MNOR, MNOR2, URNR3 and URNR4 after 6 hours, indicating that the same period where there is activity in CYOO2, there is also activity in reactions involved in CymA, MtrA, MtrB, MtrC and OmcA proteins even though these reactions eventually die off earlier. Under partial aerobic growth conditions which allow for some anaerobic respiration with fumarate as a the next possible terminal electron acceptor, the transfer of electrons from the CymA protein to the MtrA complex can be facilitated by FccA (SO0970) and STC/ CctA (SO2727) which are represented by reactions FER3, FER4 and FRD8, FRD9 pairs respectively. Both have shown to have non-zero fluxes during the same time period.

Fig. R8A. (From Upper Left to Lower Right) Time profiles of flux of reaction (1) 263 (ID: FER3), (2) 264 (ID: FER4), (3) 272 (ID: FRD8) and (4) 273 (ID: FRD9) from iSO783 over 34 hours.

Because both Fig R5 & R6 also suggest that lactate consumption only begins after 6 hours and the amount of lactate in the system is reduced to a considerably insignificant amount after 26 hours while the highest current was also maintained during this period. Hence after 26 hours, MR-1 may have chosen to break down a mixture of some lactate and other alternatives such as acetate or pyruvate and could be reason for the decrease in current output. As a result, we determine a reliable Coulombic Efficiency (CE) of MR-1 with respect to lactate consumption over the initial 7 to 26 hours. In this respect according to Fig R11, the maximum CE value attained was 75.77%, the mean CE value was 20.39% and the CE value was maintained at around 40.82% for most of the time over the time period.

Time profiles of CE using triple-objective function in dFBA: a combination of “maximize growth rate and electron activity” and “minimize overall fluxes for enzyme efficiency”.
Furthermore Fig R10 and Fig R11 also suggests that during the time period which also seen the flux sustaining the highest amount at 70 with current output of 1.870A, the increase in electron transfer activity in Fig R10 coincides with the decrease in net difference illustrated in Fig R11 after 0.28 h-1 indicating the bacteria started to consume reduced cytochrome c after that growth rate. However, when the growth rate reaches 0.34 h-1, the net difference drops further than 50 while the flux of the electron activity only reaches 20 indicating that the production of reduced cytochrome c may have decreased when the growth rate increases beyond a large amount. This could mean that to support the larger growth rate, the same metabolic resources used to support cytochrome c could have been diverted for biomass growth.
Fig. R10. Scatter plot of electron transfer generated in Mtr pathway where the red points are chosen over the time period between around 6 hours to 26 hours when lactate uptake begins and ends when pyruvate or acetate are chosen to broken down instead so as to investigate the relationship between growth rate and supporting electron transfer in the Mtr pathway.
Fig. R11. Scatter plot of net cytochrome c produced in Mtr pathway where the blue points represent the difference in flux between production of cytochrome c to support electron activity and the sum of electron transfer activity in the Mtr pathway. These points are chosen over the time period between around 6 hours to 26 hours when lactate uptake begins and ends when pyruvate or acetate are chosen to broken down instead so as to investigate the relationship between growth rate and supporting electron transfer in the Mtr pathway.
Lastly, similar suggestion can also be gathered for Fig R12 that when the lactate uptake rate was below 30 mmol/g DCW/ h, any increases in the electron transfer rates continued to be proportional to the lactate uptake rate while increases between growth rate and lactate uptake rate were proportional when lactate was below 40 mmol/g DCW/ h. However an increase beyond these points did not increase the upper bounds electron transfer rate or a proportional increase in growth rate. This suggested that generally, lactate uptake rate continues to be a major limiting factor for growth rate and electron activity in a partial aerobic with anaerobic growth condition. This also applies to the conclusion that more lactate is required to sustain the increase in growth rate than electron transfer rate since the scale of flux in reduced cytochrome c to sustain electron transfer is larger than the growth rate and so assuming all reduced cytochrome c are involved in electron transfer, growth rate generally should be more expensive in lactate consumption than electron transfer rate.

The scatter plot is fitted with 2 lines: (1) with best-fit curve of polynomial degree of 3 and (2) with the best fit linear lines following the curve to investigate the effect of varying lactate uptake rate on electron activity.

Conclusion
In this study, we managed to successfully integrate the kinetic Monod model with FBA to form a triple-objective Monod-constrained model that can maximize competing objectives in growth rate, electron activity and enzyme efficiency by considering flux distributions over transient metabolic states. Furthermore, our study also showed that lactate is a major limiting factor in both electron transfer rate and growth rate and reinforced evidences supporting competing interests between growth rate and electron transfer rate in MR-1. Hence, future designs in MFCs must consider enough resources for a sustainable balance between appropriate growth in MR-1 and maintaining good supply of electricity. Lastly, even though recent attempts were made to introduce certain forms of dynamic fluxes in FBA studies [2], those studies were still limited to the optimization of microbial growth rates only. Hence our study, as far as we know, for the first time has shown successfully the integration between a kinetic Monod model that accounts for metabolic fluctuations with FBA for the optimization of growth rates, enzyme efficiency and electricity on MR-1 in MFC design and its results, under partial aerobic with anaerobic growth conditions, for MR-1 were largely consistent with many other previous research findings.
