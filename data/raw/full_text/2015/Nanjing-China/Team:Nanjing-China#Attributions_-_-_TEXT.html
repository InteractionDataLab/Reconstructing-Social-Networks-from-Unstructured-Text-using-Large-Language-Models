Team Introduction
We are a group of enthusiastic and persistent Chinese students from Nanjing University. We started our iGEM tour as sophomores and seniors in 2014. At first, most of us were unfamiliar with synthetic biology and relevant experimental skills in molecular biology. However, we made the resolution to face this challenging but rewarding course. Our team consists of students from Life Science Department and College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The interdisciplinary team has made it possible to fully realize our vision due to a variety of special skills we harbor. We have tried to make the most of everyone’s strengths when assigning tasks, yet each team member still have the chance to keep learning something new. The iGEM competition is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get fully involved in scientific research, from coming up with a new idea, operating experiments to carrying out human practices, designing wiki and posters. During the past year, it has become our daily routine to meet up with each other, brainstorming to polish our project. What we have gained during this period of time is not only professional knowledge, but also enthusiasm for science and how to work as a team. Other than every incredible team member, we have also received amazing support from our advisors, instructors and sponsors.     Here comes our team profile.
 
Team Members
