				Overview
		    </DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px"><H3><P>Global problems concerning heavy metals, including metal contamination and metal recovery, have become increasingly significant in the aquatic environment. For one thing, metal contamination in the aquatic environment has attracted global attention owing to its environmental toxicity, abundance and persistence during recent years. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals especially heavy metal and radioactive materials have been released into rivers. For another, metal recovery for precious and minor metals has been a great need. It has become an integral part of modern society not only due to its social and economic impact but also because of the environmental one. Therefore, people have been trying to find a variety of ways to solve the problem concerning heavy metal pollution and heavy metal recovery. However, conventional ways such as precipitation, ion exchange, electrochemical methods, reverse osmosis and solvent extraction have shown certain disadvantages with respect to lack of efficiency, a waste of water, low performance at low metal concentrations and high expenses.
					</P><P>
						In contrast, microorganisms have evolved diverse mechanisms to maintain homeostasis and resistance to heavy metals such as lead, gold, cadmium, zinc and so on. With their high selectivity and sensitivity to different ions, microorganisms are capable of bio-detection and bio-remediation of toxic heavy metal ions in the environment. 
				   </P><P>
						We hope to design a novel bioreactor that can both adsorb heavy metal pollutants as well as respectively retrieve precious heavy metals. We will choose lead, one of the globally alarming heavy metals, gold, a highly valued precious heavy metal as well as an increasingly environmental concern, and uranium, the key element for nuclear-energy production, as our targets.

		1.Lead – specific binding protein, PbrR
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	A lead-specific binding protein, PbrR, and promoter pbr from the lead resistance operon, pbr, of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 have shown highly sensitive and selective whole-cell detection of lead ions. The display of PbrR on the E. coli cell surface permitted selective adsorption of lead ions from solution containing various heavy metal ions. It is also one of our parts. We obtained it by DNA synthesis.

        	GolB is a gold-binding chaperon discovered in S. typhimurium which is less than seventy amino acids in length.

		3.Uranyl – specific binding protein, SUP
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	Uranyl (UO22+), the predominant aerobic form of uranium, is present in the ocean at a concentration of ∼3.2 parts per 109 ; however, the successful enrichment of uranyl from this vast resource has been limited by the high concentrations of metal ions of similar size and charge, which makes it difficult to design a binding motif that is selective for uranyl. It has been reported that the design and rational development of a uranyl-binding protein using a computational screening process in the initial search for potential uranyl binding sites. The engineered protein is thermally stable and offers very high affinity and selectivity for uranyl with a Kd of 7.4 femtomolar (fM) and &gt;10,000-fold selectivity over other metal ions. Scientists also demonstrated that the uranyl-binding protein can repeatedly sequester 30–60% of the uranyl in synthetic sea water.
        </P><P>
        	The picture below shows the crystal structure of the designed uranyl-binding protein SUP.

		4.Endospore coat protein, Cot C
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	The Gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been extensively studied as a model prokaryotic system with which to understand gene regulation and the transcriptional control of unicellular differentiation. This organism is regarded as a non-pathogen and is classified as a novel food which is currently being used as a probiotic for both human and animal consumption. The distinguishing feature of this micro-organism is that it produces an endospore as part of its developmental life cycle when starved of nutrients. The mature spore, when released from its mother cell can survive in a metabolically dormant form indefinitely. The spore offers unique resistance properties and can survive extremes of temperature, dessication and exposure to solvents and other noxious chemicals. The protein component of the spore coat, such as Cot B, Cot C, Cot F, can be used as a fusion partner to express proteins or polypeptides on the spore surface, which we will further illustrate in the cell surface-display system.
        </P></H3></DIV><DIV>
		5.Biofilm protein, Tas A
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	Biofilms are assemblages embedded in a matrix composed of exopolysaccrides(EPSs), proteins and sometimes DNA. Matrix production results in the formation of complex architecture of typical of biofilms. In B. subtilis the extracellular matrix is composed of two major components, an EPS and the protein TasA, which polymerizes into amyloid-like fibers. Expression of the epsA-O operon, encoding the enzymes involved in EPS production, and tasA is indirectly under the control of the master transcriptional regulator Spo0A. Spo0A activity depends on its phosphorylation state. Spo0A phosphorylation is controlled by five Histidine kinases (KinA–KinE), which respond to different environmental cues. Phosphorylated Spo0A (Spo0A∼P) accumulation leads to the production of SinI, an antagonist of SinR. SinR is a transcriptional repressor that keeps the matrix genes shut off when conditions are not propitious for biofilm growth. When environmental cues that induce biofilm formation are present, the kinases are activated, and transcription of the matrix genes is induced via this signal transduction pathway.
        </P><P>
        	It has been demonstrated that plant polysaccharides can stimulate biofilm formation in B. subtilis. It mainly functions in two ways: (i) by inducing matrix gene expression and (ii) by acting as a substrate that is processed and incorporated into biofilm EPS matrix.

		6.Cell surface-display system
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	In order to improve the efficiency of heavy metal adsorption, we decide to use the cell surface-display strategy which is especially advantageous over the traditional bio-adsorption methods because of the following considerations: First, the strategy alleviates the burden of intracellular accumulation of toxic metal ions, which often results in less adsorption efficiency and poor growth of the host cells. Second, the strategy allows for faster interaction between the cell surface-displayed metalloproteins and metal ions in the environment. 
        </P><P>
        	In B. subtilis, it is possible to use at least one other spore coat component, CotC， a small 8.8 kDa polypeptide, to display heterologous antigens, TTFC (51.8 kDa) and LTB (12 kDa). TTFC is non-toxic and immunogenic and expression in E.coli, yeast, Salmonella and Lactococcus lactis has been shown to provide protection against tetanus toxin challenge. LTB is the B subunit of the heat-labile toxin produced in enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli. The malleability and functional redundancy of both CotC makes the endospore coat an attractive route for heterologous antigen presentation.

			Methods
	    </DIV></DIV><DIV>
		1.Kit construction
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	We amplified the biofilm protein TasA, the endospore coat protein CotC and their promoters from the genome of B. subtilis NCIB3610. The metalloproteins, PbrR, GolB and SUP, are obtained by totally DNA synthesis. In order to verify the expression of proteins, we also utilized a constitutive promoter Pveg, which is a biobrick part in the biological parts of iGEM.
            <A style="font-size:20px;color:#000;" target="_blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K143012">Click here to see details about Pveg.</A></P><P>
        The following figures show our constructions.

		2.Homologous recombination
	</DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail" style="margin-top:15px;margain-left:auto;"><H3><P>
        	We will then insert our genes of interest into the multiple cloning site of the shuttle plasmid pDG1730 which is shown in the picture. We insert our fusion genes between the amylase genes on the plasmid. By homologous recombination, our fusion genes will replace the amylase gene on the genome of B. subtilis.
        </P><P>
        Fig 9. The shuttle plasmid pDG1730
        </P><P>
        	In order to test and verify whether homologous recombination is successful, we built the following three steps. The first step is the antibiotic selection. The second step is the bacterial PCR analysis. The last step is the amylase activity analysis. Because the inserted gene can replace the amylase gene on the genome of B. subtilis, the starch won’t be hydrolyzed and there won’t be the hydrolysis cycle on the plate when we apply iodine on the plate with starch.

        	The following picture shows the adhesion materials that we utilize to adhere the bacteria. They were obtained from School of Environment in Nanjing University. It has been proved by us that the four kinds of materials can tightly adhere microorganisms. The following picture shows the four kinds of materials that we originally obtained, of which we will choose the second generation plastic pellet. The second generation plastic pellet has the largest specific surface area so that it can adhere more microorganisms than the left three. It is the most sufficient and caters to our need to save energy.
