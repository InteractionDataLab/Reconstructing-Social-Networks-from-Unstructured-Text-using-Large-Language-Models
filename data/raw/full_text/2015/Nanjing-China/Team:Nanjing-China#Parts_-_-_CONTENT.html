					Homologous recombination
				</DIV></DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail"><H3><P>
				After we constructed the 16 kits in E.coli, we inserted them into the shuttle plasmid pDG1730 which can transfer from E.coli to B. subtilis. We insert our fusion genes between two sequences of the amylase genes on the plasmid. By homologous recombination, our fusion genes will replace the amylase gene on the genome of B. subtilis. In order to test and verify whether homologous recombination is successful, we built the following three steps. Antibiotic selection, bacterial PCR analysis and amylase activity analysis. After a series of test and verification experiments, we have successfully inserted the 16 kits into the genome of B. subtilis. The following figure shows the result of the amylase activity analysis. The picture on the right is the control group while the pictures on the left are the experiment groups. When we applied iodine on the plate with starch, there would be hydrolysis cycles on the plate because the α-amylase gene wasn’t replaced. However, there wouldn’t be hydrolysis cycles on the plate if homologous recombination was successful.(Figure 2)

				B. subtilis cells carrying fusion proteins (TasA-EGFP and CotC-EGFP) were fixed for visualization under a fluorescence microscope. The same batch of B. subtilis cells without fusion proteins was used as s control. Strong fluorescence was observed when the B. subtilis cells expressed the fusion proteins (TasA-EGFP and CotC-EGFP), whereas no fluorescence was detected for the control group. Taken together, these results confirmed the fusion proteins can express well on the surface of B. subtilis. The following pictures show the results of fluorescence measurements.(Figure 3)

				In conclusion, the engineered B. subtilis as well as the endospores worked well in heavy metal adsorption. Adsorption of gold ions is the most efficient among adsorption of the three kinds of heavy metal. Besides, it is proved by us that Pveg is a more efficient promoter than Ptas and Pcot, so maybe we can utilize promoter Pveg when engineering B. sublitis.

					Bacteria adhesion
				</DIV></DIV><DIV class="dsjj_p_detail"><H3><P>
				As we have mentioned above, we fused the biofilm protein gene tasA with the metalloprotein genes and inserted them into the genome of B. subtilis. The engineered B. subtilis was co-cultured with the stuffing materials afterwards and we have found that biofilm formed on the stuffing materials, which is proved in the pictures below. It proves that bacterial adhesion is highly efficient on the second generation plastic pellet.

				Fig 7. Our devices
				</P><P>
				We placed the bacteria adhesion materials into devices designed by us, which is shown in the picture. Water with high concentration of heavy metal will enter the device and go through many cycles of adsorption and purification. Then the water flowing out is of low concentration of heavy metals. Besides, as we have mentioned before, our project also aimed at heavy metal recovery. Therefore, we tested the recovery rate of our device. We repeated for three times for each of the three kinds of heavy metal. The results are shown below.
				</P><P>
				As is shown, the ratio of recovery reached 97% with a concentration of 50μM/L lead ions while we recovered 90% of gold ions when the concentration of it was 10μM/L. As for uranyl, the ratio of recovery reached 76% with a concentration of 13nM/L uranyl ions. Although the recovery rate is relatively high, we are still working on it. We are still testing the longevity of the bacteria and exploring whether our engineered bacteria can function in the sediments of rivers and lakes because the concentration of heavy metal in sediments is the highest in the aquatic environment. We do hope that our device can pragmatically contribute to the development of mechanical engineering and environmental protection some day.
