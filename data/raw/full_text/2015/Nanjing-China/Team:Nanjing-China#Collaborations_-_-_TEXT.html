Team Collaboration
1.Nanjing-China
This year we are cooperating with team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We come up with an idea of combining the two projects to achieve a win-win goal, which is to desalinate sea water with a high concentration of heavy metal. They are engineering with blue algea which can desalinate sea water while we work with engineered B. subtilis which can adsorb lead, gold and uranyl selectively. We also sent them our cell adhesion materials in case they need to separate blue algea from sea water. They have been trying to utilize the material to optimize their project.

Firstly, as is known, different organisms live under diverse conditions. Therefore the first problem that we meet with is related to the living conditions of our chassis. Can our engineered B. subtilis survive in sea water? Can their blue algea survive in aquatic environment with high solution of heavy metal? Only if we solve the two obstacles can we cooperate with each other smoothly. So we decided to do some tests to confirm whether they can survive simultaneously in sea water with heavy metal. We planned to select microorganisms that meet the collaboration requirement. Unfortunately, the microorganisms used in our project were both chosen. It could be unpredictable if we had tried to modify them. Thus we had to change our plan.
After many rounds of discussion, we found that places such as estuaries could provide the two organisms with required environment. So we finally decided to desalinate polluted sea water step by step. Sea water with high concentration of heavy metal go through our purification device first so that heavy metal contaminants can be adsorbed. Next, blue algea functions to desalinate the sea water. The advantage of our idea is that we only need to make sure that our engineered B. subtilis can survive in sea water while the low efficiency problem is also inevitable.
We have been collaborating with each other since early July and the collaboration is still going on. We sincerely hope that our win-win goal can be achieved some day. Because we have found that almost all desalination technologies encounter the problem of sediments which contained a variety of heavy metal such as lead. The combination of our two teams not only identified the significance of collaboration, but could solve some real-life problems as well.
2.SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
This year, we were very close with Nanjing-China team. They are dealing with heavy metal problems through biofilms. When we talked about collaboration, we first thought about binding two projects on seawater desalination field. Thus, we discussed an application with this two project combining. Our team is responsible for explain this application and its supporting fact. Nanjing-China team will explain the details which needs to be discussed to make this working for real.
First, we start with the features of seawater and the end purpose of the combination project. Most of the seawater desalination plant use open-water intake near costal to avoid intake costs. This also means that the factories can’t avoid to deal with different pollutions in costal seawater, including heavy metal pollution.
The main source of coastal heavy metal pollution is runoff and atmospheric sedimentation. From 2006 to 2007, Oceanic Administration of People’s Republic of China did a massive-scale offshore detection for water condition. In its report, the concentration of lead, copper, zinc and mercury in seawater which is over the first seawater class at some monitoring spots. Among them, average lead concentration in the Bohai Sea is over the first seawater class, and some of the monitoring spot detect a number over the second seawater class. The natural degradation of heavy metal is very difficult. Also, the offshore is relatively big water body which makes the pollution hard to increase as well as decrease. Overall, the heavy metal pollution of Chinese offshore cannot be overlook when we use seawater as material.
In normal desalination process, even normal resource water has to go through some sedimentation processes. In fact, one of the safety concern of general seawater desalination is what do we do with those sediments. The idea of cooperating two project is to merge Nanjing-China team’s project to achieve a new seawater recovery and utilizing system.
The word “circular economy” should be familiar to most people. In China, this is one of the guiding ideology for the economic and society development. The core of the concept is to maintain the balance between resource and waste. To balance the rapid consumption of resource, man should not only depend on nature but also ourselves to turn wastes into resources.
Unlike water has a strong nature balance itself, heavy-metal’s nature circulation is much slower. We need to use man power to turn every waste kind into resource. In this concept, seawater desalination combing heavy-metal recycling will be the key to build the heavy metal’s balance.
The origin of heavy metal comes from the river, therefore, it is hard to control from the origin. Most of the study dealing with heavy metal in seawater focus on recovery and has to work in an open condition. The efficiency of absorption largely depends on the mobility of seawater. IT also brings some safety concern by introducing new species to original ecosystem.
For example, the main recovery method focuses on mangrove in China. Mangrove is salt-torrent and absorb heavy-metal naturally. However, because it is plant, the study and application of mangrove will be relatively slow.
Seawater desalination is one of the few seawater alternating technology that pumps in the seawater. It also has complicated process, and part of it could be replaced by Nanjing’s project. Thus, we should look at two projects’ combination as environmental restoration and seawater alternation using the same artificial water flow.Back to circular economy, this will increase the force that heavy-metal waste change into resource with a low cost adding.
Journal
In March, we founded our team and recruited our team members, after with we divided our team members into several groups and each group is responsible for one part of the competition. We were also busy brainstorming about our project and signing up for iGEM competition.
In April, we confirmed our project. A majority of the team members wanted to deal with problems related to heavy metals. Then we searched online and read many articles related to our project. We also made a plan about the procedures of all the experiments.
In May, we were busy with kit construction and part construction. We were also contacting different authorities and scheduled for interviews.
In June, we went on with kit construction and started the homologous recombination part. We also interviewed with a government official.
In July, we were engaged in adhering the engineered bacteria onto the material that we used. We also tested for the four kinds of bacteria adhesion materials. Some members were busy with modeling. We also started our collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
In August, we were doing experiments about heavy metal adsorption and busy with the test of our designed device. We also attended the CCiC conference in Beijing and presented our project to Chinese iGEM teams. Besides, we also interviewed with a college professor, an advisor in a sewage disposal enterprise and an organizer in an environmental protection group.
In September, we were preparing for the Jiant Jamboree in Boston, including the posters, wiki, leaflets and mascots.
Protocols
1.DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
Excise  the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean,  sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
Absorb  the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel  slice (tare with empty tube).
Add 3  volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
Resuspend  the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating  for 6-8 minutes). If low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3  minutes will do a lot of help to accelerate the solubilization.
Note: Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is fully dissolved.
Add  0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less  than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
Note: After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of yellow.

11.Preparation for competent B. subtilis cells
Streak out the strain to be made competent on an LB or TBAB agar plate as a large patch and incubate overnight at 30 ℃.
The following morning scrape off the cell growth off the plate and use to inoculate fresh, pre-warmed, SpC medium to give an OD600 reading of about 0.5.
Incubate the culture at about 37℃ with vigorous aeration and take periodic OD readings to assess cell growth.
When the rate of cell growth is seen to depart from exponential inoculate 200ml of pre-warmed, SpⅡmedium with 2ml of stationary-phase culture and continue incubation at 37℃ with slower aeration
After 90min incubation, pellet the cells by centrifugation at room temperature.
Carefully decant the supernatant into a sterile container and save.
Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 18ml of saved supernatant and add 2ml of sterile glycerol; mix gently.
Aliquot the competent cells in sterile tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or a dry-ice bath and store at -70℃.
12.Transformation
Thaw competent cells rapidly by immersing frozen tubes in a 37 ℃ water bath.
Immediately, add one volume of SpⅡEGTA to the thawed cells; mix gently.
In a sterile test tube add competent cells to the DNA solution and incubate in a roller drum at 37℃.
Dilute the transformed cells as appropriate in T Base containing 0.5% glucose and plate immediately onto selective media.
13.Amylase activity analysis
Apply iodine on the plate with 0.1% starch and spectinomycin.
Incubate the engineered bacteria and non-engineered bacteria onto the plate at 37℃.
See if there are hydrolysis circles on the plate.
