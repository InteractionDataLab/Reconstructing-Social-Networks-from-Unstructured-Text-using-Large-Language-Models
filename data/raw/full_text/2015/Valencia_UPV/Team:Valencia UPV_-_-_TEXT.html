AladDNA
Jamboree Results!
In the 2015 Giant Jamboree we had a great time, learned an incredible amount of SynBio, and won a GOLD MEDAL! Other teams were deeply attracted by our SynBiocraft Minecraft mod, the light of our bioreactor model with magic lamp shape, and judges had a very positive valoration of our presentation and our biological decoder , the star of our project. Don't hesitate on checking our webpage. Enjoy your travel through the Valencia UPV iGEM project.
AladDNA
Conventional bioproduction methods require huge and specialized infrastructures for each new product, difficulting the fulfilment of the manufacturing needs in remote locations. What if we could just send information that could unfold on site? AladDNA is an innovative genetic design aimed to encode the manufacturing instructions for several bioproducts as genetic information. It is also capable to process this information on demand as single output products in response to the userÂ´s wishes. Just like a genie in a lamp!
This system uses DNA to store information inside a plant seed, acting as a miniaturized and flexible biofactory capable of producing different bioproducts such as interferon alpha or anti-choleric vaccines. Equipped with an optogenetically controlled decoder, AladDNA can activate the production of different high-added value products upon the reception of external signals based on combinations of light stimuli. AladDNA allows bioproduction in any condition avoiding prohibitive costs due to infrastructures.
No matter where you are or what you need, just ask your wish!
Because AladDNA has no frontiers!
