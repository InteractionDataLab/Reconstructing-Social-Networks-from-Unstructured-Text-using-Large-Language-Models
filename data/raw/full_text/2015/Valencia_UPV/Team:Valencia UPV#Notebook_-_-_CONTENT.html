Turn off the light and with the red light on open the cassette and place a sheet of autoradiography film on top of the membrane (bend the lower right corner to mark the orientation). Close the cassette and expose the film for 1’. To develop the film place it on the rear feeding tray (shorter side of the film opposite to the bent corner against the feeding area to minimize the possibility that the film gets stack in the processor) and press the button next to it to start the feeding. Adjust exposure time as necessary.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DETAILS><DETAILS><SUMMARY class="button fit">Protoplasts protocol</SUMMARY><DIV class="clsPadding"><P>We make protoplasts in to different ways. At first we make protoplasts with a normal Nicotiana leaf and then we try to transform the alive protoplasts. After the infiltration at vacuum we can not obtain protoplasts, we change the method. First we agroinfiltrate leafs with the desired construction, we let them 3 hours in dark and then make the protoplasts. The general steps for every preparation is:</P><P>1.	Prepare the enzymatic solution. It has 5mL of Mannitol (0.8M) + 200 µl KCl (1M) + 400 µl MES (0.5M, pH 5.7) + 150ng cellulase + 40mg Macerozyme + 4.2mL H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Total volume for one preparation. Put it 10min at 55ºC. </P><P>2.	Take out the solution and let it cool down.</P><P>3.	Add 100 µl CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> + 4 µl Beta-Mercaptoethanol + 100 µl BSA (10%).</P><P>4.	Put the enzymatic solution in a petri dish and cut the leaf in very thin strips. Put quickly the cut leafs so they do not dry.</P><P>5.	In darkness, do the vacuum for 30min to the petri dish with the enzymatic solution and the cut leaf. Let the leaf 3h in darkness, no agitation.</P><P>6.	Swirl the plate gently. Using a 5ml pipette tip (cut off the tip first) take the liquid and filter them with a 35-75 µm nylon mesh into a 13 mL tube. To clean the mesh add before a little bit of W5 solution. Also put the leaf stripes first and then throw the enzymatic solution.</P><P>7.	Add 5ml of W5 solution.</P><P>8.	Centrifuge at 100xg for 1min without brake.</P><P>9.	Eliminate the supernatant. Leave a small volume so that the protoplasts do not dry.</P><P>10.	Add WI solution till reach the desired concentration (10<SUP>7</SUP> protoplasts per gram). </P><P>11.	Finally put into the plate wells 250 µl of W5 and 100 µl of protoplasts solution.</P><P>Solutions:</P><P>W5: NaCl (154mM) + CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> (125mM) + KCl (5mM) + MES (2mM) + 17.8ml H20. Total volume of 50ml.</P><P>WI: MES (4mM)(pH 5.7) + NaCl (154mM) + CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> (20mM).</P></DIV></DETAILS><DETAILS><SUMMARY class="button fit">Protoplast luciferase assay protocol</SUMMARY><DIV class="clsPadding"><P>Before doing the essay the protoplasts are in a plate in the light conditions needed.</P><P>1.
