Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree, done !
Complete the Judging form.
Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree -we hope you like it.
Create a page which must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Biobrick 1, 2 and 3 are proved to work as expected.
Biobrick 4, 5, 6 also did doing something.
Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device.
Check them: BB1 , BB2 , BB3 , BB4
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project (ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, intellectual property rights...)
We studied the safety concerns our project could have as a transgenic plant, together with the legallity of this kind of products in Europe and the need of a medical control in the case of drugs production.
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project
Our team has created a virtual reality which allows everybody to have access to a synthetic biology lab. Also, it makes possible to teach in an easy and comprehensive way what SynBio is and how it works.
Help a registered iGEM team from another university in a significant way by characterizing a part:
We developed a satisfactory collaboration with Norwich team, by agroinfiltrating their part to test it. They also sent us their Mo-Flippers, which allows to convert our Golden Braid assemblies to BioBrick standard.
Our team and Tuebingen team joined forces and made a collaboration , by making an important assembly of a CDS for them.
We also participated in small surveys and other projects in order to help a bit other teams.
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM): BB
