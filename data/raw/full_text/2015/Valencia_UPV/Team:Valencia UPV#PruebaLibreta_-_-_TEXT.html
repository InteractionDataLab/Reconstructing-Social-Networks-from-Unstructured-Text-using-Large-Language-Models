We had 2 cultures from the last day, corresponding to other 2 colonies of ligation.
Agrobacterium culture of promoter less: Luciferase + Renilla

How to ask and make primers?
Select the sequence to amplify and save in FASTA format.
gbCloning, go to Tools-Domesticator-1º Category
Add FASTA and select parts.
On the protocol we have the primers
The oligos they give us:
4 first nucleotides: so the enzyme can recognize without problems
6 following bingind sites.
1 extra nucleotide.
4 overhangs.
Meeting with Daniel Ramón (Biopolis).
Ligation with part 2 and 24 of task sheet.

If we make a digestion of 160 (35S:Renilla:tNOS-35S:P19:tNOS) with EcoRV, we obtain: 2475, 381, 4601 pb.
If we make a digestion of 896 (Luc:Pif6:PhyB)with EcoRV, we obtain: 11608, 3942 pb.
