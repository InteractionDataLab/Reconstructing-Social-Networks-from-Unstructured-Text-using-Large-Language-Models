All the Valencia UPV team members contributed to each and every part of the project. All of us have learned things in many different areas thanks to the team work. However, some people were more commited to specific parts of the project. In this page we give the attributions to every student, advisor, instructor, patient lab members and hand-offering friends.
The idea: many and many sessions of brainstorming between all the students brought up the draft of the project.
Circuit design: Iván Casas, Alba González, Rubén Escriba, Pilar Baldominos, with the help of our advisor Alfredo Quijano.
Planning and project design: Rubén Escriba, Pilar Baldominos, with the help of our advisor Alfredo Quijano.
Toggle blue design: Rubén Escriba, Pilar Baldominos.
Recombinases reporters constructions: Iván Casas, with the help of our advisor Alfredo Quijano.
Safety (Human Practices): Agostina de Luca and Mónica Gutiérrez.
Notebook: Agostina de Luca
Device (the magic lamp): Mónica Gutiérrez and Marta Millet, with the great help of our advisor Guillermo Puchalt.
Modelling design: Alba González and Marta Millet.

Advisors
Alfredo Quijano: the omnipresent advisor, there everytime we needed something, and there to illustrate us with synthetic biology, new ideas and new focus.
Guillermo Puchalt: invaluable help with the electronics and design of the Magic Lamp, present to help with everything.
Asun Fernández del Carmen, Institute for Plant Molecular and Cell Biology (IBMCP, CSIC-UPV): incomparable aid in everything, from wet lab work to project design. Thanks also for controlling us a bit.
Instructors
Thanks to Diego Orzáez, Alberto Conejero, Jesús Picó and Javier Urchuergía for their commitment with the students, for letting us know about the iGEM and for all the help provided. Is because of them we have lived the incredible experience the iGEM is.
Acknowledgments
We truly thank people who have helped us in the project. We appreciate the effort made by each and every person involved -even a bit- in the project. We would like to give special thanks to:
NRP-UEA-Norwich team: for the MoFlippers to convert our Golden Braid parts to Bio Bricks.
IBMCP (CSIC-UPV) staff: for hosting us at the Institute, and putting up with us for taking up your benches and borrow your material. Also thanks for answering everytime we asked "how do we...?" or "where do we...?".
Pedro Ayala, Design Deparment of the Technical School of Design Engineering (ETSID - UPV): for the 3D printing and plastic printing of the Magic Lamp.
Francesc Benimeli, Institute of Automation and Industrial Computing ai2 - UPV: for the 3D printing of the small parts of the Magic Lamp.
Miguel Albero, Institute of Automation and Industrial Computing ai2 - UPV: for its help acquiring the electronic components.
We would like to offer our special thanks to the following institutions for their support in the development of AladDNA:
Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) and Vice-rectorate for Student and University Extension,
Technical School of Design Engineering (ETSID - UPV),
Technical School of Agricultural Engineering (ETSIAMN - UPV),
Institute for Plant Molecular and Cell Biology (IBMCP, CSIC-UPV).
