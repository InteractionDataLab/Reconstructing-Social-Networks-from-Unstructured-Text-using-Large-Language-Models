SULSA Talks
Mon 8 June
This was our very first opportunity to pitch our project idea, which we delivered to the other two Scottish iGEM teams. It was great to see what the other teams were doing and take part in some fun team building activities!
Meeting with Kenny Laing
Mon 15 June
Kenny Laing works for the Scottish Police Services Authority in Forensic Services where he is team manager overseeing four Mark Enhancement laboratories. He highlighted to us why fingerprint ageing is so difficult, namely due to the sheer amount of factors which can affect fingerprint composition, but also stressed how useful a tool with such capabilities would be.
Meeting with Stuart Macbride
Thurs 25 July
Award-winning, crime author Stuart Macbride was kind enough to spare some of his time before receiving his honorary degree at the University of Dundee. He was able to give us an exciting insight into the workings of the criminal mind and his intriguing writing process but also explained how important it is to manage public expectations of Forensic Science.
CSI guy
Mon 8 June
We were fortunate enough to speak with a Scenes of Crime Officer who has experience working in a variety of environments. He was very enthusiastic about our BioSpray idea, saying that an all in one tool such as ours would markedly improve the efficiency of crime scene investigation since it would significantly reduce the time needed to perform a thorough examination as well as the potential for contamination.
Lawyers
Mon 15 June
Mark Stewart QC and Brian McConnachie QC both operate in the High Court of Justiciary and James Laverty is a solicitor and module organiser of Criminal Procedure and Advocacy Diploma in Legal Practice at the University of Dundee. All three gentlemen unanimously agreed that each element of our tool kit would be of most value being used in an investigative sense. This showed that although they may not necessarily be used for providing evidence that would be presented in a court of law, there is real potential for our devices to play key roles in the earlier stages of investigations.
