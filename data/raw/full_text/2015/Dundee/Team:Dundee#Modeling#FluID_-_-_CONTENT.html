These models allow us to calculate the optimum binding rates and the optimal concentration of proteins to use in FluID. Calculating the optimal conditions is required to achieve maximum fluorescence from the nanobeads, making detection more efficient. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) were formed using the law of mass action, to describe the change in concentration of each of substances over time. Initial concentrations and binding rate parameters were estimated using information from literature, then sensitivity analysis was used to find the optimal value for these parameters. The ODE’s were solved using MATLAB’s ode23 solver which uses a Rosenbrock formula, the simulations were then run for a range of values for the parameters to perform sensitivity analysis. To see the results of these methods and the specific method for each of the four substances in FluID, click below. We also considered the FluID as a whole and the effect that both the nanobeads and the other proteins would have within the spray.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION id="about" class="row1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3"><H3>Blood Model</H3><P class="about-content">Consider the binding between haptoglobin and haemoglobin.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><H3>Semen Model</H3><P class="about-content">Consider the binding between spermidine and potD.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><H3>Saliva Model</H3><P class="about-content">Consider the binding between lactoferrin and lactoferrin binding protein.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><H3>Nasal Mucus Model</H3><P class="about-content">Consider the folding of the odorant binding protein.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="about" class="row1"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H3>FluID Concentration</H3><P class="about-content">Consider FluID as a whole.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><DIV class="container"><SECTION id="blood"><DIV class="row3"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 feature"><DIV class="row"><H2><B>Blood: Haptoglobin and Haemoglobin Binding Model</B></H2><B>Aim</B><P>The aim of a model describing the binding between haptoglobin and haemoglobin is to find the optimum concentration and binding rates that we require for visual detection of haemoglobin in the sample from the crime scene.

From Figure 1, it is clear that the optimum complex formation will be when \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\) are as high as possible. However, we also notice that if \(\lambda\) is small, even if \(\gamma\) is large, no complex is formed, and vice versa.

The more folded OBP formed the more likely that a visual detection of nasal mucus in the sample will be obtained using FluID.</P><B>Results</B><P>Odorant binding protein 2A (OBPIIa) is found in human nasal mucus and are involved in odorant detection. Within the protein there is an eight stranded \(\beta\)-barrel and an \(\alpha\) helix. The \(\beta\)-barrel and the \(\alpha\) helix bind via a disulphide bridge, to allow for odorant detection by the OBP, this is called folding (1). For detection of nasal mucus at the scene of a crime, modified \(\beta\)-barrels will be within FluID. The \(\beta\)-barrels will fluoresce when bound to an \(\alpha\) helix within an OBP in the sample. The reaction that has to be considered is the natural binding between the \(\alpha\) helix and the \(\beta\)-barrel, so that the modified \(\beta\)-barrel can be designed to be more likely to bind than its natural counterpart. The folding process can be described by the scheme:</P><FONT size="4">

}  $$</FONT><P>where \(\alpha\) represents the concentration of \(\alpha\) helices, \(\beta\) represents the concentration of the \(\beta\)-barrels and \(OBP\) represents the folded protein concentration. The kinetic association and dissociation rates are \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{-1}\) respectively. The initial concentrations of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(OBP\) are denoted \(\alpha_{0}\), \(\beta_{0}\) and \(OBP_{0}\), respectively, where the ratio of \(\beta_{0}\) to \(\alpha_{0}\) is denoted:</P>

Sensitivity analysis was performed to find the optimum values of both \(\psi\) and \(D_{0}\), which give the optimal level of complex formation.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 8: Sensitivity analysis for the binding efficiency, defined by parameter \(\psi\) and ratio of initial concentrations, \(D_{0}\) for potD and spermidine binding. We see that there are optimal values for both the binding efficiency and the level of OBP \(\beta\)-chains we add, where adding more makes no significant difference to complex produced. The more complex formed the more fluorescence there will be allowing for visual detection of odorant binding proteins.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><P>
The sensitivity analysis indicates that there are optimal values for both \(\psi\) and \(D_{0}\), where increasing the value has very little effect on the complex formation. This was further investigated, firstly by setting \(\psi\) as the estimated value from <A href="#eq28">(Eq 28)</A>, and varying \(D_{0}\) as above.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 9: Complex formation over time with increasing \(D_{0}\). Complex formation with increasing levels of odorant binding protein \(\beta\)-chains determined by \(D_{0}\).

From the plot we can see that there is a relatively high optimal value of the ratio \(D_{0}\) and thus calculate the level of \(\beta\)-chains required in the FluID detector to detect odorant binding protein.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><P>
This suggests that if we increase the ratio of \(\beta_{0}\) to \(\alpha_{0}\) so that it is larger than the suggested value from literature, more complex will be formed. Since we know the suggested value of \(\alpha_{0}\), it can be suggested that there should be a concentration of:</P>

The initial suggested concentration of un-folded odorant binding protein, \(\alpha_{0}\) and \(\beta_{0}\), can be calculated from values provided from literature. From work by Schiefner <A href="#nasal_ref1">(1)</A> and Briand <A href="#nasal_ref3">(3)</A>, the estimated initial concentration of \(\alpha\) was calculated as:</P>

$$
<P>
From literature <A href="#nasal_ref1">(1)</A><A href="#nasal_ref3">(3)</A> it was also suggested from literature that the ratio between \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) was 1:1, therefore a suggested value of \(D_{0}\) is:</P>

D_{0}=1. \tag{Eq 24}

Due to a lack of experimental data and previous research a specific expected value for both kinetic rates, \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{-1}\), cannot be stated. However, a standard range for a dissociation constant, \(K_{d}\), was found by Archakov, <A href="#nasal_ref4">(4)</A>, to be:</P>
$$
\large{
\begin{equation}
K_{d}=\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}}=10^{-8} \rightarrow 10^{2} \mu \text{M}. \tag{Eq 25}

$$
<P>
Using <A href="#eq23">(Eq 23)</A> and the mean value of <A href="#eq25">(Eq 25)</A>, an estimated value for \(\psi\), can be determined as:</P>
$$
\large{
\begin{equation}
\psi=1322751323. \tag{Eq 26}

However, this value was too large to compute using MATLAB so a smaller value was chosen, where:</P>
$$

\begin{equation}
\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}=200 \quad \mu M^{-1}. \tag{Eq 27}

From  <A href="#eq23">(Eq 23)</A> and  <A href="#eq27">(Eq 27)</A> a more suitable value for \(\psi\) was chosen to be:</P>

The system of non-dimensionalised ODE's derived from <A href="#eq21">(Eq 21)</A> were solved using  MATLAB's ode23 solver <A href="#nasal_ref5">(5)</A>.
