Research
Life After iGEM
Testing and Developing
Developing research is the first step after iGEM, to  consolidate and  confirm the ideas. For any product or method to be credible in the forensic science industry the early research needs to be verified by multiple academic institutions. This is to  make sure the idea is scientifically robust and worth investing time and money. The verified  research could then help bring a product to market or aid in the courts of law.  The research could also form the beginning of a product design process. Before the design process could begin we would have to ensure that all the lab work is completed. Allowing us time to fix the errors that have appeared over the ten week project.
If any of the project was  made into a product  we would need to test what environmental factors would affect its use.  Futhermore, Wed also need to run basic tests to see how it would interact with different terrain. The key test will be too see how FluID and fingerprint ageing device would work in different environments. Any results would results would be made public and would need to be peer reviewed. After this we could the look to commercialisation of the forensic toolkit.
Overview
Look at the overview for the future of our project.
Commercial
Looked at  commercialisation  theory of our project.
Different directions
Look at two unique ideas that could be used to take are project in different direction.
