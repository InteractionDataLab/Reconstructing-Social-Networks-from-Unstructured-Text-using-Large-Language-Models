Grant Buchanan: Research Assistant in MMB: Grant provided us with various lab equipment such as plates, competent cells, etc. He also helped us to purify our proteins.
Marta Albareda: Marta showed us how to carry out a bacterial two hybrid system  assay which would be used to investigate interactions between our proteins.
Lucia Licandro Lado: Lucia provided us with SDS gels and on occasion, generously allowed us to use her bench space and equipment.
Dundee DNA Sequencing Services: Thank you for providing us with the much needed free sequencing.
Thank you to Dr Jackie Heillbron (MMB manager), Erin Stanbridge (MMB secretary) and to Anna Vainikka (MMB technician) and a general thank you to the whole of MMB for helping us orientate ourselves in the labs, for answering our questions and helping with various lab techniques.
Here are a few of the people from MMB who have helped us out and provided us with great banter!
Centre of Anatomy and Human Identification (CAHID)
Niamh Nic Daéid: Professor of Forensic Science and Director of Research: Niamh has supported our project from the very start, sharing all her expertise in the area as well as her very long list of invaluable contacts.
Sue Black: Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology:
Lucina Hackman: Lecturer in Human Identification: Dr Hackman provided valuable information on bone cut investigations as well as advice and equipment for the bone incision experiment.
Laura Daly: PhD Research Student and Laboratory Technical Assistant: Laura assisted with the bone incision experiments.
Sam Goodchild: Greenhouse Anatomy Demonstrator / PhD Scholarship: Sam provided training for the Kodak Pro X-ray machine and assisted with the bone incision experiments.
School of Engineering, Physics and Mathematics

University of York
James Moir: He kindly provided us with genomic DNA for N. meningitidis MC58.
Media
Roddy Isles: Head of Press: We would like to say thank you for organising all the media coverage for CSI:Dundee.
STV: For following Roddy's call and broadcasting a report about our project.
BBC Radio Scotland: For not losing patience over the probably most problematic skype interview ever.
Others
We would also like to thank Avril Smart for her help with graphics, design, and FluID.
