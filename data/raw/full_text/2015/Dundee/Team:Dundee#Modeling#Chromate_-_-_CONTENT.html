Models of the chromate pathway were used for two purposes; to compare the original biobrick and modified biobrick systems and to investigate GFP production with different levels of chromate input. Physics experiments aimed to represent the relationship between the applied force, sliding distance and wear volume when a stainless steel knife collides with bone.

This suggests that the modified pathway will give a lower output than that of the original pathway. The lab had some concerns over the reliability of the original pathway, as it was shown to be prone to false positives due to leakiness. Leakiness, in this case, refers to when \(GFP\) is produced even when the promoter is closed, which will give GFP production even in the absence of chromate. To investigate this further a leakiness term was introduced to both the modified and original pathway models. The simulations were then ran again using ode23 <A href="#chrome_ref1">(1)</A>  and compared.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 4: Plot comparing the likelihood of false positives in the form of genetic leakiness of both plasmid systems.

The only difference is the time it takes for this steady level to be obtained. The higher the initial concentration of chromate, the faster it will reach the steady level, described earlier. Also note the modified pathway can achieve the optimal \(GFP\) concentration in less time than the original. This information was passed to the lab, who decided to use the modified plasmid system as it is just as reliable as the original system.</P><B>Method: Deriving Equations</B><P>Using the law of mass action the modified pathway reactions can be written as a system of ordinary differential equations:</P>

By calculating the force required to make the incision, this could potentially indicate the size or strength of a possible suspect, while the sliding distance would correspond to the length of the blade. This relationship is determined by the Archard equation for wear <A href="#bone_ref1">(1)</A>:</P><CENTER><FONT size="6">W = kSP</FONT></CENTER><P>where, W is the volume of wear, S is the sliding distance, P is the applied force and k the wear coefficient. This is intended to complement the chromium detector which would be used in a stabbing or decapitation case.</P><B>Results</B><P>From experimental methods a value of 6.23x10<SUP>-9</SUP> was found for the wear coefficient. Using this the Archard equation was modelled on MATLAB to produce a parabolic surface plot, relating the volume of incision to the length of the blade and the force of stabbing. As expected the volume will increase, as the force and sliding distance increase. The following graph was obtained:</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Figure 7: Overview of the 3D surface plot produced using MATLAB to show the relationship determined by the Archard equation for bone and stainless steel.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><B>Method</B><P>To use the Archard equation, first a value for the wear coefficient, k, between bone and stainless steel needed to be determined experimentally. The linear relationship between the volume of wear and force exerted can be investigated and the gradient of the produced graph then found. The gradient will be equal to kS, where k is the wear coefficient and S is the known sliding distance. Therefore k can be calculated.</P><P>To do this, a piece of equipment called an Instron 4204 was used, this is a computer controlled electro-mechanical testing system capable of performing a variety of tests based on tension and compression <A href="#bone_ref2">(2)</A>. This was used alongside the Bluehill program. For our needs, this equipment is used to measure the force needed to continue compression at a set rate, and therefore the force needed to cut through the bone. This was done for speeds of 5mm/min, 10mm/min and 20mm/min on 2 pig ribs and 4 pig shoulder bones. A knife is clamped to the Instron machine and a bone placed on a stand below. The program is started and the knife is lowered at a set speed using the set up below:</P><CENTER><FIGURE1><FIGCAPTION> Figure 8: The Intron 4204 with the knife attached and bone placed on stand below.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE1></CENTER><P>The program is started and stopped manually, allowing the extension to also be determined manually. For this purpose a start and end point is marked on the knife, meaning the extension is a control factor throughout the experiment and kept at 32mm. The Bluehill program then produces a graph of the force against extension, so the maximum force exerted to cut through bone can be found and recorded. This is done for 25 different incisions and the force exerted for each is recorded
The next stage is to determine the volume of each incision. As the incisions are so small they could not be measured by hand. A Kodax dxs 4000 Pro System was used to x-ray the bones. This was used along side two programs; Carestream and Image J. Carestream allowed a high resolution image of the incision to be produced, by choosing the optimum focal length and field of view. The image is then edited and the clearest contrast chosen. </P><CENTER><SECTION id="about" class="row1"><DIV class="row"><CENTER><DIV><P>
Figure 9: An example of the images captured using x-ray imaging. The incisions are barely visible and therefore could not be measured by hand.</P></DIV></CENTER><P>The image is imported into Image J and the scale set. Now the width and depth of the incision can be measured using the 'Line' tool then 'Analyse and Measure'. The results are then saved in a table. Finally the length of the incision is measured by hand using a Vernier Calliper.</P><P>Now the volume is calculated by assuming the shape of the incision as a prism. The simple formula:</P><CENTER><FONT size="6">
W=(<SUP>hb</SUP>⁄<SUB>2</SUB>)l</FONT></CENTER><P>where W is the volume, h is the depth, b the width and l the length, is used. In Excel, the volume can be plotted against the force for each incision. A linear trendline is added and the gradient is found, in this case a value of 2x10<SUP>-11</SUP>. The gradient is equal to the wear coefficient times the blade length. The wear coefficient is therefore found to be 6.23x10<SUP>-9</SUP>.</P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Figure 10: Graph of volume against force, from which the gradient can be found and therefore the wear coefficient. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><P>Now the wear coefficient has been found the Archard equation can be modelled in MATLAB. </P><CENTER><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Figure 11: A graph showing the relationship between the volume of a bone incision, length of the blade and force of stabbing. The parabolic surface plot shows that the volume will increase as the length of the blade or the force increases.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></CENTER><B>Discussion</B><P>From the experimental process a value of 6.23x10<SUP>-9</SUP>
 was obtained. However the graph itself had a very low R<SUP>2</SUP> value. This value  is the percentage of variance in the date which can be explained by the model. This low value means the graph could be considered inaccurate. As the values of volume measured are all relatively accurate, with all uncertainties in the range of 3x10<SUP>-12</SUP> to 7x10<SUP>-11</SUP>. This would suggest that the anomalies are due to the method used to make incisions. Although the actual measurement of force was accurate, the method of applying force may not have been. The knife was clamped onto the jaws of the Instron 4204, but still swivelled slightly when force was applied. A manual attempt was made to ensure the blade stayed straight. However, as this coefficient had never been previously calculated it is unknown how much of an effect this had on the overall result.</P><B>References</B><OL><LI>Thompson JM, Thompson MK.
