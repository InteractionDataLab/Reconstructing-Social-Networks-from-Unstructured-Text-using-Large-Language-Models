Medal Requirements
Bronze
✔  We registered our team.
✔  We completed the judging form.
✔  We created our team wiki and submitted our parts to the registry.
✔ We are ready (and very excited!) to present our poster and presentation at the jamboree.
✔ We have attributed the team members and sponsors and acknowledged the work that has been carried out by others. See our attributions page.
✔ We have built and submitted new biobrick parts to the iGEM registry.
Silver
✔ We designed and experimentally validated several BioBricks that work as expected.
✔ This characterization is documented for each part on the corresponding ‘main page’ sections of the registry.
✔ We submitted all of these parts to the registry.
✔ We looked into the ethics behind forensic science and it became one of the real driving forces of our project.          To read about the ethics involved in our project in more depth visit our human practices page.
Gold
✔ We improved the characterisation of the previously existing part BBa_K1058008 created by the Beijing Institute of Technology 2013 team.          You can find our experimental data and read more about this aspect of our project here.
✔ We have worked with several of this year’s iGEM teams and you can find out more about this on our collaborations page.
✔ Over the course of our project we spoke with a wide range of experts to help develop our forensic toolkit.          We wanted to find out where the gaps were in terms of forensic techniques so that we could design something          that would be really useful to the forensic science community. Visit our human practices page for an overview          of our meetings and what we gained from each one.
