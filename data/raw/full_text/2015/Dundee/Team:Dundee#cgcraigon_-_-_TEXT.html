25/8: Perfored an anaerobic betagalcosidase assay in order to determine the level of interaction of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25.
Aim of Experiment: Performed an anaerobic betagalctosidase assay of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25. This is to determine the level of interaction that the smaller subunit of OBP2A has with its larger subunit in vivo. This particular assay has two positive controls, two negative controls and one regulatory control.
Protocols Used: Betagalctosidae assay p>
Results: Must add in results.
Next Steps: As the results have shown that the two subunits of OBP2A in fact don't seem to be interacting in vivo - a possible reason might be aggregation of the two subunits preventing interaction. Then the next stage of experimentation will be to test out the interaction when the subunit are switch with regards to the vectors pUT18 and pT25. This will be the goal of the following weeks once the team is back from London.
