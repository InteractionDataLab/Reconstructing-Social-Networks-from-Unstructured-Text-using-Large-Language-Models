5/8:Day culture and plating of positive colonies from transformation onto MacConkey agar.
Aim of Experiment: To perform a day culture and then subsequent plating of positive colonies from the transformation performed on the 4/8. Positive colonies from this transformation contain both vectors of the bacterial two hybrid system along with the two subunits of OBP2A and so now the interaction can be observed. The day culture will be plated onto MacConkey agar which once the cells have been given enough time to grow will give a visual demonstration of the  protein interaction through a color change.

Next Steps: It has been decided that whilst the E.coli strain BTH101 that is being used in this experiment is useful for visualizing protein interaction, it is very unstable. A better E.coli strain called MG1655(Δcya) will be used instead as it is much more stable. This means that tomorrow overnights will be prepared of MG1655(Δcya)for transformation with pUT18-OBP2A and then subsequently pT25-OBP2A.

7/8: Results of MacConkey agar growth and transformation of  MG1655(Δcya)with pUT18-OBP2A
Aim of Experiment: To perform a transformation of MG1655(Δcya)with pUT18-OBP2A. Also the results of plating of our bacterial two hybrid interaction onto MacConkey agar has produced promising results as the colonies appear to be taking up a small amount of red dye - an indicator of protein interaction. This suggests that the two separated parts of OBP2A may in fact be interacting in vivo. This interaction will need to be quantified through the use of the β-galactosidase assay.
Protocols Used: Transformation

Aim of Experiment: To perform a transformation of MG1655(Δcya) containing pUT18-OBP2A with pT25-OBP2A. Positive colonies were produced from the transformation done on the 7/7 and so as a result a day culture was produced and subsequently re-transformed with pT25-OBP2A.
Protocols Used: Transformation
Results: N/A
Next Steps: If the transformation of MG1655(Δcya) with pT25-OBP2A is successful then the next step of experimentation will be to undertake the β-galactosidase assay

25/8: Performed an anaerobic β-galactosidase assay in order to determine the level of interaction of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25.
Aim of Experiment: Performed an anaerobic β-galactosidase assay of OBP2A in the bacterial two hybrid vectors: pUT18 and pT25. This is to determine the level of interaction that the smaller subunit of OBP2A has with its larger subunit in vivo.

Next Steps: The results have shown that the two subunits of OBP2A in fact don't seem to be interacting in vivo - a possible reason for this might be aggregation of the two subunits preventing interaction. The  next stage of experimentation will be to test out the interaction when the subunit are switch in relation to heir positions on the vectors: pUT18 and pT25.

Figure 1: Amplification of OBP2A for insertion into pSB1C3 vector . This is the PCR product from the amplification of OBP2A from the IDT plasmid using primers for cloning into pSB1C3. The gel indicates OBP2A has been amplified successfully since the observed band corresponds to the expected size of 500 bp. The concentration of the gel extracted OBP2A is 335.53 ng/ul.

Figure 2: A subsequent gel was run of the amplified OBP2A after it was first excised from the gel in figure 1 - this was to determine if the gel extraction was successful. The gel indicates that OBP2A has been extracted from the gel successfully, since the observed band corresponds to the expected size of 500 bp. This can now be restricted in preparation for ligation into pSB1C3.

Figure 3: A gel analysis of my restriction digest from the 24/6. This gel analysis was done to determine if the reason for the failed transformation was an improperly digested OBP2A. This gel indicates that the restricted product hasn't been lost as the OBP2A gene fragment can be seen as a distinct band at 500 bp. A re-ligation of OBP2A into the pSB1C3 backbone will now occur.

Figure 4: Presequence Digest of pSB1C3-OBP2A. All seven plasmid purifications of the overnight cultures done on the 26/6 were digested to see if they contained the OBP2A insert. It is clear from the gel that all but sample 3 contain the insert for OBP2A as they all have faint bands at 500 bp's which corresponds to the size of OBP2A. It also appears that sample 5 contains the highest concentration, so that will be the sample that is sent for sequencing.

Figure 5: Presequence digest of pUT18-OBP2A to determine if any samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that of the  5 samples that were digested only two are show to have the OBP2A insert, therefore sample 2 will be sent for sequencing.

Figure 6: Amplification of OBP2A for insertion into pT25 vector . This is the PCR product from the amplification of OBP2A for cloning into pT25. The gel indicates OBP2A has been amplified successfully since the observed band corresponds to the expected size of 100 bp.

Figure 7: Presequence Digest of pT25-OBP2A, in order to determine if any of the samples contain the OBP2A insert. It can be seen from this gel that samples 5, 6 and 7 may have inserts in them as they each have two distinct bands, one of which corresponds to the 100 bp size for the OBP2A for pT25. As a result all three samples will be sent for sequencing.

Figure 8: A graph of the results from the first attempt at a β-galactosidase assay that aimed to characterize the interaction between the two separated parts of OBP2A. As it can be seen that the positive result has failed(far left) not much can be inferred from the interaction of the two parts of OBP2A. However it looks like the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting. As this was a first attempt, subsequent assays will be performed in order to determine if in fact the two separated parts of OBP2A aren't interacting in vivo - like these results suggests.

Figure 9: A graph of the results from the second attempt at a β-galactosidase assay that aimed to characterize the interaction between the two separated parts of OBP2A.  It can also be inferred from this graph that the two parts of OBP2A don't seem to be interacting as it has a low millers activity when compared to the controls. Further assays will be performed in order to determine if the two separated parts of OBP2A aren't interacting in vivo like these results suggests.
Close
×
Figure 11: A graph of the results from the anaerobic β-galactosidase assay aimed to characterize the interaction between the two separated parts of OBP2A. The graph seems to suggest that the two subunits of OBP2A may not be interacting in vivo. This can be inferred from the fact that the millers activity of the OBP2A sample lies lower than the negative controls from within the experiment. As a result of this information, one more assay will be prepared in which the two subunits will be switched with regards to the bacterial two hybrid vectors to eliminate any possibility of this being a factor effecting the interaction between the two subunits.

Gel Extraction Protocol
The desired DNA fragment was excised from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
The gel slice was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. 700µl of Buffer QG was added.
The gel slice was incubated in a water bath at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). The tube was vortexed every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel.
After the gel slice had been dissolved completely, the color of the mixture was checked that it was yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture was orange or violet, 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 would be added, and mixed. The color of the mixture would turn yellow.
230µl of isopropanol was added to the sample and mixed.
A QIAquick spin column was placed in a 2ml collection tube. The sample was applied to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.
500µl of QG buffer was added to the QIAquick spin column and centrifuged for 1 minute. The flow-through was discarded.

Transformation Protocol
100µl of competent cells were defrosted. Thaw on ice.
Agar plates were taken out of 4oC to warm to room temperature.
1-5µl of DNA was added to cells.
Cell and DNA mixture was left on ice for 20 minutes.
Mixture was placed in 42oC water bath for 90 seconds.
Mixture was put back on ice for 2 minutes.
1ml of LB (without antibiotic) was added to cells.
Cells were allowed to grow for 1 hour at 37oC in a shaking incubator.
Cells were then spun down and the supernatant discarded.
The pellet was resuspended in the 100µl.
Cells were plated on agar plates with appropriate antibiotic.

Assay Preparation
Take 3 independent colonies from each plate of your controls and samples and place each colony into 5 ml of LB with the appropriate antibiotics.
Leave to grow overnight at 30°C.
Take 50 μl of each overnight and inoculate 5 ml of fresh LB containing the appropriate antibiotics. Do this twice for every independent colony.
Allow these to grow at 30°C shaker until the O.D of each inoculate is between 0.3-0.5
Once the O.D is between 0.3-0.5 take 3 x 1 ml samples of each culture and place into separate Eppendorf tubes.
Take a further 1 ml and place into a cuvette and  subsequently measure the O.D at 600 nm marking down the O.D for each replica.
Spin down the 1 ml cultures of each replica at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes.
Remove th supernatant from each 1 ml culture and freeze cell pellet for later use in the β-galactosidase Assay.

β-galactosidase Assay
Resuspend cell pellet in 800ul of buffer 2 (100 mM dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4); 20 mM KCl ; 2 mM MgSO4 ;0.8 mg/mL CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) ; 0.4 mg/mL sodiumdeoxycholate) and subsequntly add 5.4 μL/mL beta-mercaptoethanol.
Add 50 ul of SDS (0.1%) to each sample.
Add 50 ul of Chloroform to each sample and vortex for 30 seconds.
Make substrate solution (60 mM Na2HPO4; 40 mM NaH2PO4; 1 mg/mL o-nitrophenyl-β-D-Galactoside (ONPG); 2.7 μL/mL β-mercaptoethanol)
Add 200 ul of substrate solution to each sample marking down the time it was added in relation to the first sample.
Wait for an observable color change and mark down the time that the color change occurred.
Add 600 ul of NaCO3(1M) once the color change has occurred.
Spin down the samples at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes and place the supernatant into a cuvette
Measure the O.D of each sample at 420 nm
