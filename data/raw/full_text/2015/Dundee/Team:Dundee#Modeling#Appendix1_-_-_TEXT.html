The figure shown in the haptoglobin and haemoglobin binding model were created using MATLAB. Before using MATLAB the original system of equations was non-dimensionalised to the system:
$$   \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{dHp}{d\tau}&=&[Hp\cdot \alpha_{H}]-\lambda Hp \alpha_{H},\\ \frac{d\alpha_{H}}{d\tau}&=&[Hp\cdot \alpha_{H}]-\lambda Hp \alpha_{H},\\ \frac{d[Hp \cdot \alpha_{H}]}{d\tau}&=&\lambda Hp \alpha_{H}-[Hp \cdot \alpha_{H}]-\gamma [Hp \cdot \alpha_{H}],\\ \frac{d[Hp \cdot \alpha_{H} \cdot \beta_{H}]}{d\tau}&=&\gamma [Hp \cdot \alpha_{H}]. \end{eqnarray*} $$
The initial conditions were also non-dimensionalised to become:
$$  \begin{eqnarray*} Hp(0)&=&4.17,\\ \alpha_{H}(0)&=&1,\\ [Hp \cdot \alpha_{H}](0)&=&0,\\ [Hp \cdot \alpha_{H} \cdot \beta_{H}](0)&=&0. \end{eqnarray*} $$
