She’s very relaxed when it comes to following a protocol! But somehow still manages to get the job done. She is also very determined even after the 18<SUP>th</SUP> attempt at cloning the same gene! Her favourite thing in the world (other than iGEM of course…) is anything sweet. It’s fair to say that she is totally obsessed with cake! </P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for: </B>Breaking into a patisserie and stealing all the sweet stuff!</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divCaitlin"><P><B>Name:</B> Caitlin Connolly</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Molecular Genetics</P><P><B>Role:</B> Spicing up our Friday nights and keeping our benches tidy!</P><P><B>About:</B> She’s very strict when it comes to following a protocol! Caitlin loves her biology and takes lab work very seriously – although her PPE could do with some work after an incident involving her fingernail and a centrifuge. She cheers us up with her great puns, sassy chat and never fails to snap us out of our bad moods!</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Because of her fear of flying, being drugged by friends and causing an emergency landing.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divCallum"><P><B>Name:</B> Callum T-C</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Biochemistry </P><P><B>Role:</B> The Wiki Master and Wet Lab.</P><P><B>About:</B> When Cal’s not teaching himself HTML for our wiki, you’ll find him in the gym. He likes to oil up and flex his muscles, as his second ambition in life is to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Cal was hot to learn HTML, due to us having no students who study computers science or design. He’s a bright lad with an uplifting Scottish voice. If you see him in Boston ask him to say “There’s been a murrr-der!”.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Open container, 5.9% ABV.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divConner"><P><B>Name:</B> Conner Craigon</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Molecular Microbiology</P><P><B>Role:</B> Our personal encyclopedia, maker of incompetent cells, and the scapegoat. </P><P><B>About:</B> When he’s not being in the lab you’ll probably find him playing video games or with his head in a geeky book. He’s a scatter brain but an extremely hard worker and an integral part of our iGEM family.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Consumption of illegal quantities of energy juice!</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divEd"><P><B>Name:</B> Edward Smith-Uchotski</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Physics</P><P><B>Role:</B> Telling rubbish jokes and winding up Hannah.</P><P><B>About:</B> When he’s not flying planes or in the boxing ring, he’s hard working in the office. By office I mean pub.  He is overly chatty, so it was his big mouth that helped us out with Human Practices. There’s not a forensic expert in Dundee that hasn’t heard him talk. If you see him in Boston, you can keep him.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> More likely to be the victim of a crime, after pushing his fellow team-mates over the edge with his sense of ‘humour’.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divFiona"><P><B>Name:</B> Fiona Macfarlane</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Mathematical Biology </P><P><B>Role:</B> Dry team mother figure. King of MATLAB.</P><P><B>About:</B> Fiona is a 4th Year math-bio student. When she isn’t mothering the dry team she’s mothering her foot soldiers at the Girls’ Brigade. Her hobbies include listening to Scottish folk and world domination. Her name has become synonymous with mathematical perfection: “Wow you just totally Fiona’d your homework”.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Assisting her friend rob a bank because they asked her politely.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divHannah"><P><B>Name:</B> Hannah Boyd</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Physics</P><P><B>Role:</B> Stabbing things, mathematical modelling and hitting Ed every time he tells a bad joke. </P><P><B>About:</B> Some people just want to watch the world burn, Hannah would rather just watch Ed burn.
She’s a hardworking Northern Irish Gal, who packs a punch when it comes to working. Her mathematical brain has helped crack many tough problems. Her creative touch has given everything a sparkle through the whole iGEM process. Fun fact about Hannah is she can still say the whole alphabet even after 10 Guinness’s or 7 G ‘n’ T’s.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Going on a GTA style rampage by first stealing a car, driving it over a ramp into the air and crashing it into a flying helicopter. Then stealing another car and having a wild car chase, similar to fast and furious scene, she would then kidnap a Kim Kardashian. This is because this woman adds nothing to science. After a long standoff with armed SWAT Teams Hannah would then hop in her Batmobile which she had hidden all along, and drive right through them.  Following a second lengthy car chase she would eventually be stopped by a fully armed apache helicopter. Finally she'd be arrested for being the most bad-ass Northern Irish lass to have ever walked the earth. I’d drink to that. </P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divLucy"><P><B>Name:</B> Lucy Armstrong</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Molecular Genetics</P><P><B>Role:</B> Wet lab work and wiki wizard</P><P><B>About:</B> Lucy is a true thoroughbred Scottish lassie. When she was born she came out playing the bagpipes. Aside from eating haggis and throwing massive logs around, you’ll find her working in the wet lab. Her wealth of knowledge in biology and genetics is astounding for such a young scientist. After spending most of her university summers on lab placements. She’d be a great asset to any team.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for: </B>Putting a cat in a bin. </P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divManuel"><P><B>Name:</B> Manuel Blank</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Biological Sciences</P><P><B>Role:</B> Chromate Sensor</P><P><B>About:</B> Jack of all trades is the description that is most suitable for Manu. He joined iGEM because he felt it’s the most amazing way of encouraging entrepreneurship in undergraduate students. He came into iGEM as a Biologist, but ended up being anything from a Physicist to a Networking Guru. He’s a short German man with a great sense of humour, and he’s always pushing us to strive out of our comfort zones.  </P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Civil disobedience - Being arrested after causing a riot by eating a steak at the world vegan summit. </P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divThomas"><P><B>Name:</B> Thomas Eve</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Mathematical Biology</P><P><B>Role:</B> Dry team and all round principal component analysis (PCA) enthusiast.</P><P><B>About:</B> Tom is a 3rd year math-bio student with a keen interest in all things science and will tell everyone, and their granny about PCA. When he’s not in the dry lab you will find Tom enjoying Brazilian music and discussing the ins and outs of politics, and life, with team mate Conner.  If you are very lucky Tom will even perform a fantastic cover of the female part of 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin, or even some classic rap songs.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> : Stalking the politician, Jeremy Corbyn.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divFatima"><P><B>Name:</B> Fatima Ulhuq</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> PhD in Molecular Microbiology</P><P><B>Role:</B> Mr Motivator, twitter fanatic and pizza provider in times of need</P><P><B>About:</B> Fatima is our resident iGEM veteran. She is our go to gal when nothing seems to work! She runs a very tight ship. Fatima has showed us how to do pretty much everything in labs and has managed to avoid a mental breakdown despite the whole iGEM team nagging her! </P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Drunk and disorderly behaviour (drunk on sugar that is!)</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divLucas"><P><B>Name:</B> Lucas J. Morales</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology</P><P><B>Role:</B> Modelling/Advisor</P><P><B>About: </B> A passionate man who is known for bringing meat and cheese in a carrier bag to a meeting. It doesn't sound particularly strange until you know that it wasn't packaged. It was just in the carrier bag, jostling about. Regardless, he's always been keen to help, but did leave it to the very last minute.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Stealing a penguin and going out with it.</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divFrank"><P><B>Name:</B> Frank Sargent</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Stress manager</P><P><B>Role:</B> Instructor</P><P><B>About: </B>He is a microbiology professor who is on one-man undercover mission to make Dundee the best place in the world to study biotechnology.

She said “ iGEM is the best part of the undergraduate curriculum! It’s Intense, tiring but 100% worth it”.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Hula-hooping</P></DIV><DIV class="targetDiv" id="divDyce"><P><B>Name:</B> Fordyce Davidson</P><P><B>Current Studies:</B> Mathematics and Budgets!</P><P><B>Role:</B> Instructor</P><P><B>About:</B> He has recently taken over as the Interim Dean for Science and Engineering. Sadly, his magnificent maths skills are now used to balance the books. At the start he said “iGEM is an intensely rewarding experience for students and instructors. I am privileged to be able to work with this talented interdisciplinary group each year.” We are not sure if he still thinks that.</P><P><B>Most likely to be arrested for:</B> Murder by Karaoke!</P></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></ASIDE></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV id="nav"><NAV class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top navbar-collapse" role="navigation"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="navbar-header"><A href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><SPAN class="navbar-brand">  University of Dundee</SPAN></A></DIV><DIV class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1"><UL class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee"> Home</A></LI><LI class="dropdown"><A href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"> About Us</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Team">Meet the Team</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Attributions">Attributions</A></LI></UL><LI class="dropdown"><A href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"> Project</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Abstract">Abstract</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Forensic_Toolkit">Project Overview</A></LI><LI class="dropdown-header">Devices</LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Forensic_Toolkit/FluID">FluID</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Forensic_Toolkit/Fingerprints">Fingerprint Ageing</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Forensic_Toolkit/Chromate">Chromate Biosensor</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Part_Collection">Parts</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Medals">Medals</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Future">Future Work</A></LI><LI class="dropdown"><A href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"> Wet Lab</A></LI><LI class="dropdown-header">Lab Book</LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Lab_Book/FluID">FluID</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Lab_Book/Fingerprints">Fingerprints</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Lab_Book/Chromate_Detector">Chromate Biosensor</A></LI><LI class="dropdown-header">Useful Information</LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Protocols">Protocols</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Sequences">Sequences</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Bacterial_Two_Hybrid">Bacterial Two Hybrid</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Safety">Safety</A></LI><LI class="dropdown"><A href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"> Dry Lab</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Modeling">Introduction</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Modeling/Biospray">FluID</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Modeling/Fingerprints">Fingerprint Ageing</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Modeling/Chromate">Chromate Biosensor</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Modeling/Appendix1">Appendix : Code</A></LI><LI class="dropdown"><A href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown"> Outreach</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Practices">Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Ethics">Ethics</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Collaborations">Collaborations</A></LI></DIV></DIV></NAV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="footer-btn"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Introduction_Video" class="btn btn-info btn-lg" role="button">Watch Our Introduction Video</A></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class=""><DIV class="container"><DIV class="col-md-3"><H4>Dundee University</H4>
