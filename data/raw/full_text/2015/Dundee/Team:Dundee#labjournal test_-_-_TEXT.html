SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting
1. 50µl of an overnight culture was used to inoculate 5ml of fresh LB containing the appropriate antibiotics and left to grow at 37oC in a     shaking incubator.
2. Once the OD600=0.6-0.8, 1mM of IPTG was added to the culture and left to grow for a further 3 hours.
3. 1ml of each culture was taken and spun down in a microcentrifuge for 3 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, 950µl of 2x Laemmli sample buffer was added to 50µl of B-mercaptoethanol.
5. The supernatant was discarded from the samples and the pellet resuspended in 200µl of the above solution.
6. The samples were then boiled at 90oC for 10 minutes.
7. Afterwards, they were spun down for 1 minute in a microcentrifuge.
8. At this stage, the samples could be stored at -20oC or ran on a gel immediately.
9. Two gradient gels consisting of a 12% separating gel and a stacking gel were prepared and the samples ran at 100V until proteins reach end of the     stacking gel at which point the voltage was increased to 200V for 20 minutes.
10. One gel was stained using Instant Blue and the other was used to transfer the proteins onto a membrane.
11. After the proteins had been transferred onto the membrane using a semi dry transfer ran for 40 minutes at 5V, the membrane was blocked in 5% Marvel milk overnight at 4oC.
12. The next day, the membrane was washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer and then suspended in 10ml of 1xTBS buffer to which the primary anti-His antibody was     added and left for one hour. The protein ladder was cut off before adding the primary antibody.
13. The membrane was then washed 3 times in 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes and then suspended in 10ml of 1xTBS buffer, to which the secondary antibody was     added and left for one hour.
14. The membrane was then washed in 3x10ml 1xTBST buffer for 5 minutes.
15. The blot was then soaked in developing solution for 5 minutes before being wrapped in a plastic cover aligned with the protein ladder that was cut off     at step 12.
16. Once in the developing room, the film was exposed to the blot for 30 seconds, 2 minutes and 5 minutes and then placed in the film developer.

Growth Curve Assay Protocol
1. 5ml overnight cultures of the appropriate strains were set up.
2. The next day, 4x 995µl of plain LB containing 1µl ampicillin and 1µl of chloramphenicol were inoculated with 5µl of the overnight culture.
3. Three were induced with 0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM of IPTG and one was left uninduced.
4. 200µl of each culture was loaded onto a 96 well microtitre plate with 4 repeats.
5. The cultures were left to grow for 16 hours in the plate reader which took OD readings every 10 minutes.

Protein Purification Protocol
1. A 150ml overnight culture was set up for the desired protein.
2. 3 x 1L of fresh LB containing 1ml of appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with each 50ml overnight culture and left to grow until an OD600 =0.6-1 in a shaking incubator at 37oC.
3. The cultures were subsequently induced with 1mM IPTG and left to grow for 6 hours in a shaking incubator at 20oC.
4. They were then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4200rpm at 4oC.
5. The pellets were then resuspended in 5ml of ice cold 50mM 7.5 Tris and transferred to a 50ml falcon tube and then topped up to 40ml with 50mM 7.5 Tris.
6. They were then spun down again at 4000rpm for 15 minutes at 4oC, the supernatant discarded and pellets stored at -20oC.
7. Once purification could proceed, the pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 40ml of 50mM Tris containing DNAase, 1 x protease inhibitor tablet     and lysozyme. (Note: If purifying a membrane protein, 1% DDM was also added).
8. The cells were lysed using a cell disruptor.
9. Afterwards the lysate was spun down in a J25.50 rotor at 15000rpm at 4oC for 40 minutes.
10. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a 50ml falcon tube. The pellet was kept for testing. Both were kept on ice.
11. Using FPLC, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column.
12. The protein was eluted using an increasing concentration of imidazole. The two buffers used were Buffer A: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole and     Buffer B: 50mM Tris, 200mM NaCl, 1M Imidazole. (Note: If purifying a membrane protein 0.02% DDM was added to these buffers.)
13. The fractions corresponding to any peaks were retained and concentrated using an appropriate filter size. A small amount of each fraction could be ran     on an SDS gel at this stage.
14. Using FPLC, the sample was then loaded onto a SEC column and any fractions corresponding to a peak were ran on an SDS gel to check for the presence of     the desired protein.
15. Fractions containing the desired protein were collated, to which 20% glycerol was added.
16. The samples were then flash frozen and stored at -80oC.

Figure 4: LbpA Culture Samples. Lane 1: Sample from uninduced culture. Lane 2: Sample from culture induced with 1mM IPTG. It seems that on comparison of the two cultures, that inducing expression of LbpA causes the cells to die given the significant reduction of protein levels visible on the gel.

Figure 5: OD600 Readings from Uninduced Culture and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG). The table shows that after being induced with IPTG the cultures stop growing since their OD600 readings are notably lower than that of the uninduced control.

Figure 6: Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG) The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, the induced cultures stop growing when LbpA expression is induced. After ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have dealt with the production of the foreign protein.

Figure 7: Growth Curve of Uninduced and Induced Cultures (0.5mM, 1mM and 2mM IPTG) The graph shows that on comparison with the uninduced control, after reaching an OD600 of 0.6,  the induced cultures stop growing when LbpA starts to be expressed. Similar to the previous growth curve assay, after ~7 hours, it is possible that the emergence of mutants causes the the OD to rise again or the cells have dealt with the production of the foreign protein.

Figure 2: SDS Gel of Uninduced and 1mM IPTG Induced Cultures of PotD and SBP. For PotD, it is clear from the gel that it is being successfully overexpressed since there is an intense band present at the 37kDa marker which corresponds to the expected size of PotD in the induced culture sample. For SBP, there is no band present which suggests SBP is being overexpressed.
