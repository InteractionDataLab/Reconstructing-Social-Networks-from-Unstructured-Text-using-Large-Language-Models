SUPERVISORS
Name: Aimée Lamb
Current Studies: Anatomy and Physiology
Role: Our twitter cover girl, hashtag extraordinaire and day brighten-upper
About: Aimée never fails to cheer us up in the lab with her chit chat and big smile. She’s very relaxed when it comes to following a protocol! But somehow still manages to get the job done. She is also very determined even after the 18th attempt at cloning the same gene! Her favourite thing in the world (other than iGEM of course…) is anything sweet. It’s fair to say that she is totally obsessed with cake!
Most likely to be arrested for: Breaking into a patisserie and stealing all the sweet stuff!
Name: Caitlin Connolly
Current Studies: Molecular Genetics
Role: Spicing up our Friday nights and keeping our benches tidy!
About: She’s very strict when it comes to following a protocol! Caitlin loves her biology and takes lab work very seriously – although her PPE could do with some work after an incident involving her fingernail and a centrifuge. She cheers us up with her great puns, sassy chat and never fails to snap us out of our bad moods!
Most likely to be arrested for: Because of her fear of flying, being drugged by friends and causing an emergency landing.
Name: Callum T-C
Current Studies: Biochemistry
Role: The Wiki Master and Wet Lab.
About: When Cal’s not teaching himself HTML for our wiki, you’ll find him in the gym. He likes to oil up and flex his muscles, as his second ambition in life is to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Cal was hot to learn HTML, due to us having no students who study computers science or design. He’s a bright lad with an uplifting Scottish voice. If you see him in Boston ask him to say “There’s been a murrr-der!”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Open container, 5.9% ABV.
Name: Conner Craigon
Current Studies: Molecular Microbiology
Role: Our personal encyclopedia, maker of incompetent cells, and the scapegoat.
About: When he’s not being in the lab you’ll probably find him playing video games or with his head in a geeky book. He’s a scatter brain but an extremely hard worker and an integral part of our iGEM family.
Most likely to be arrested for: Consumption of illegal quantities of energy juice!
Name: Edward Smith-Uchotski
Current Studies: Physics
Role: Telling rubbish jokes and winding up Hannah.
About: When he’s not flying planes or in the boxing ring, he’s hard working in the office. By office I mean pub.  He is overly chatty, so it was his big mouth that helped us out with Human Practices. There’s not a forensic expert in Dundee that hasn’t heard him talk. If you see him in Boston, you can keep him.
Most likely to be arrested for: More likely to be the victim of a crime, after pushing his fellow team-mates over the edge with his sense of ‘humour’.
Name: Fiona Macfarlane
Current Studies: Mathematical Biology
Role: Dry team mother figure. King of MATLAB.
About: Fiona is a 4th Year math-bio student. When she isn’t mothering the dry team she’s mothering her foot soldiers at the Girls’ Brigade. Her hobbies include listening to Scottish folk and world domination. Her name has become synonymous with mathematical perfection: “Wow you just totally Fiona’d your homework”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Assisting her friend rob a bank because they asked her politely.
Name: Hannah Boyd
Current Studies: Physics
Role: Stabbing things, mathematical modelling and hitting Ed every time he tells a bad joke.
About: Some people just want to watch the world burn, Hannah would rather just watch Ed burn. She’s a hardworking Northern Irish Gal, who packs a punch when it comes to working. Her mathematical brain has helped crack many tough problems. Her creative touch has given everything a sparkle through the whole iGEM process. Fun fact about Hannah is she can still say the whole alphabet even after 10 Guinness’s or 7 G ‘n’ T’s.
Most likely to be arrested for: Going on a GTA style rampage by first stealing a car, driving it over a ramp into the air and crashing it into a flying helicopter. Then stealing another car and having a wild car chase, similar to fast and furious scene, she would then kidnap a Kim Kardashian. This is because this woman adds nothing to science. After a long standoff with armed SWAT Teams Hannah would then hop in her Batmobile which she had hidden all along, and drive right through them.  Following a second lengthy car chase she would eventually be stopped by a fully armed apache helicopter. Finally she'd be arrested for being the most bad-ass Northern Irish lass to have ever walked the earth. I’d drink to that.
Name: Lucy Armstrong
Current Studies: Molecular Genetics
Role: Wet lab work and wiki wizard
About: Lucy is a true thoroughbred Scottish lassie. When she was born she came out playing the bagpipes. Aside from eating haggis and throwing massive logs around, you’ll find her working in the wet lab. Her wealth of knowledge in biology and genetics is astounding for such a young scientist. After spending most of her university summers on lab placements. She’d be a great asset to any team.
Most likely to be arrested for: Putting a cat in a bin.
Name: Manuel Blank
Current Studies: Biological Sciences
Role: Chromate Sensor
About: Jack of all trades is the description that is most suitable for Manu. He joined iGEM because he felt it’s the most amazing way of encouraging entrepreneurship in undergraduate students. He came into iGEM as a Biologist, but ended up being anything from a Physicist to a Networking Guru. He’s a short German man with a great sense of humour, and he’s always pushing us to strive out of our comfort zones.
Most likely to be arrested for: Civil disobedience - Being arrested after causing a riot by eating a steak at the world vegan summit.
Name: Thomas Eve
Current Studies: Mathematical Biology
Role: Dry team and all round principal component analysis (PCA) enthusiast.
About: Tom is a 3rd year math-bio student with a keen interest in all things science and will tell everyone, and their granny about PCA. When he’s not in the dry lab you will find Tom enjoying Brazilian music and discussing the ins and outs of politics, and life, with team mate Conner.
If you are very lucky Tom will even perform a fantastic cover of the female part of 'A Whole New World' from Aladdin, or even some classic rap songs.
Most likely to be arrested for: : Stalking the politician, Jeremy Corbyn.
Name: Fatima Ulhuq
Current Studies: PhD in Molecular Microbiology
Role: Mr Motivator, twitter fanatic and pizza provider in times of need
About: Fatima is our resident iGEM veteran. She is our go to gal when nothing seems to work! She runs a very tight ship. Fatima has showed us how to do pretty much everything in labs and has managed to avoid a mental breakdown despite the whole iGEM team nagging her!
Most likely to be arrested for: Drunk and disorderly behaviour (drunk on sugar that is!)
Name: Lucas J. Morales
Current Studies: PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology
Role: Modelling/Advisor
About: A passionate man who is known for bringing meat and cheese in a carrier bag to a meeting. It doesn't sound particularly strange until you know that it wasn't packaged. It was just in the carrier bag, jostling about. Regardless, he's always been keen to help, but did leave it to the very last minute.
Most likely to be arrested for: Stealing a penguin and going out with it.
Name: Frank Sargent
Current Studies: Stress manager
Role: Instructor
About: He is a microbiology professor who is on one-man undercover mission to make Dundee the best place in the world to study biotechnology. He told us iGEM brings joy, freedom and excitement into research. He lied.
Most likely to be arrested for: Irresponsible mixology
Name: Tracy Palmer
Current Studies: Microbiology
Role: Instructor
About: She is the Head of the Division of Molecular Microbiology, part time lab worker and full time counsellor. She said “ iGEM is the best part of the undergraduate curriculum! It’s Intense, tiring but 100% worth it”.
Most likely to be arrested for: Hula-hooping
Name: Fordyce Davidson
Current Studies: Mathematics and Budgets!
Role: Instructor
About: He has recently taken over as the Interim Dean for Science and Engineering. Sadly, his magnificent maths skills are now used to balance the books. At the start he said “iGEM is an intensely rewarding experience for students and instructors. I am privileged to be able to work with this talented interdisciplinary group each year.” We are not sure if he still thinks that.
Most likely to be arrested for: Murder by Karaoke!
