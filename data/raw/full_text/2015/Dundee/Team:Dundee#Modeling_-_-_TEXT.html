Dry Lab
Introduction
Introduction
In our project three approaches were taken within the dry lab; data analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), modelling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and practical physics experiments. Mathematical modelling can be used within synthetic biology to reduce complex biological systems to their key components, allowing for a quantitative understanding of the reactions occurring. Models can then be considered in the lab to allow for optimisation of the techniques to produce the best end result.  ODEs were used to model the change in concentration of substances over time, this was implemented within all aspects of the project; FluID, fingerprint ageing and the Chromate Biosensor.
PCA is a statistical procedure whereby a dataset with many dimensions is simplified to its principal components in order to visualise hidden correlations. PCA was used to analyse the composition of fingerprints for the fingerprint ageing. Physics experiments were used to investigate the incisions on bones by stainless steel knives to complement the chromium biosensor part of the toolkit.
The development of software, such as MATLAB, has allowed for greater use of mathematical models across the whole of synthetic biology. MATLAB was used in all aspects of the dry lab work, all code used can be found in our appendix via links at the bottom of each section.
