Ethics
One reason why ethics is so important in the field of forensic science is because the criminal justice system relies so heavily on forensic evidence. Forensic evidence can make or break a case and in doing so, have a great impact on the lives of others. If one piece of evidence is mishandled or misinterpreted,      it could lead to a person's life being changed dramatically or prevent justice from being served. Because the general public make up the jury, the public’s       perception of forensic science is incredibly important as it can have a big impact on the outcome of a court case.
Some people in the general public may see forensic evidence as absolute truth, without taking into consideration the error present in all scientific methods. Forensic scientists call this the ‘CSI effect’       because TV shows like this tend to overstate the capabilities of forensic techniques. In reality sometimes the evidence collected and presented is down to expert       interpretation rather than scientifically robust analysis. For example, blood spatter patterns, hair and fibre analysis, firearm and tool marks are commonly depicted       on CSI. These techniques rely on the judgment of individual experts and can’t really be validated with statistics. In other words, these techniques are not       particularly scientifically robust.  So of course, results from tests such as these which can sway the jury are actually not reliable and this can lead to miscarriages      of justice which could happen to anyone. This is where the innocence project comes in.
The Innocence Project is a non-profit legal organization that is committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people. So far over 300 cases have been exonerated in the USA, of which 18 were on death row. And they state that 47% of the      exonerated cases were due to improper forensic science.
This is one of the reasons we became so passionate about our project. We decided that we wanted to take       a different approach to forensics and put science first. We came up with the idea of creating a robust, useful and easy to use set of techniques for crime scene      analysis - our forensic toolkit, which we hope, can help prevent these wrongful convictions and bring perpetrators to justice.
