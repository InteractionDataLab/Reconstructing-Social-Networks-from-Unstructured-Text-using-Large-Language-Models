Frozen stock of each strain about to be put into the incubator for overnight growth.
Our team worked closely with Vanderbilt University’s iGEM team over the summer to help them troubleshoot issues they had been having regarding a promoter and to come up with questions to ask our panel.
Vanderbilt had issues concerning part K314100, which is a constitutive promoter. There were concerns that the promoter had nonhomogeneous expression despite its identity as a constitutive promoter. Additionally, Vanderbilt asked us to test another part, R0010, under the same conditions. We took their parts and induced them with IPTG to determine their effectiveness. We ran a total of 6 induction experiments, three using our lab’s induction protocol and three using their lab’s induction protocol. The parts were transformed and induced in DH10B as well as MG1655. The specific protocols we used can be found under the “Materials and Methods” section of the wiki.
Our protocol required the growth of a stationary phase culture to begin the experiment. After leaving a tube of culture sitting in the incubator overnight, we took that culture out the following day and diluted it in a new culture to an OD of 0.1. We grew that culture for another 2 hours. Afterwards, we prepared 8 serially diluted IPTG concentrations in corresponding mixtures of LB and antibiotic. Then, having pipetted those solutions to different columns in a 96 well plate, we pipetted the newly grown cultures into their separate rows. We incubated 3 of these plates for 7 hours.

A. Finalized component average results for each component in varying inducer concentrations using our lab’s protocol. E. coli strain BL21 is designated by “BL,” and strain MG1655 is designated by “MG.” Values were obtained by taking the average of the fluorescence at each inducer concentration. Negative controls, which consist of the wildtype strain grown in each corresponding inducer concentration, were averaged and then subtracted from each component value. “R0010 BL” showed a 2x increase in fluorescence across inducer concentration; other components remained static.
B. Graph of finalized component average results with error bars showing standard deviations. R0010 in BL21 is designated by blue, R0010 in MG1655 orange, K314100 in BL21 gray, and K314100 in MG1655 yellow. No significant change in fluorescence was observed in any component other than R0010 expressed in BL21.
Additionally, we also used their protocol as a means to test the validity of the two parts. Similar to our protocol, stationary phase cultures were grown overnight. The following morning, those cultures were pipetted into their allocated rows with prepped, diluted inducer concentration corresponding to the appropriate column. The fluorescence values we measured followed no strict patterns and greatly differed from plate to plate. Since the deviations we obtained for each point were significant, the results from this experiment were inconclusive.

Measure OD at 600 nm in cuvettes for each culture (OD O/N) (900 uL water and 100 uL culture well mixed)
Dilute cultures to OD of 0.1 in a total of 4 mL fresh LB/antibiotic (just LB for the BL21 and MG1655) in new 14 mL culture tubes
Volume of overnight culture = (0.1*4)/(OD overnight)
Incubate 2 hours at 37 deg C and 250 rpm
While waiting for the incubation to complete, label eighteen 15 mL conicals, cm-1 through cm-9 and wt-1 through wt-9 to create 5x dilutions.

Add 8 mL LB and 8 μL cm to conicals cm-1 through cm-8.
Add 10 mL LB to conical wt-9.
Add 8 mL LB to conicals wt-1 through wt-8.
Calculate volume to take from the 0.5 M IPTG stock to achieve the max [IPTG] with the following equation.
Vstock = (10 mL total in tube)*(2.5mM IPTG)*(0.6 mL total in deep well plate)/((500 mM IPTG)*(0.5 mL inducer/LB/ antibiotic in deep well plate)
Add 60 μL of 500 mM IPTG to conicals cm-9 and wt-9.
