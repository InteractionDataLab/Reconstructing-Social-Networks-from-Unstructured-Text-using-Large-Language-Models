Collaborations
The University of Lethbridge Collegiate iGEM team has aided the High School iGEM team in troubleshooting wet lab experiments, specifically with the assembly of our three constructs Nuclease (BBa_K1792004), Dextranase (BBa_K1792002), and Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000). Advice was given with experiments such as transformations, restriction digests, ligations, minipreps, and construct design.
In addition to our collaboration with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team, we organized and hosted an Alberta wide wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams, Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, and Lethbridge were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of Ligations, Making Competent Cells, Transformations, Minipreps, and Gel Electrophoresis were taught, to name a few.
