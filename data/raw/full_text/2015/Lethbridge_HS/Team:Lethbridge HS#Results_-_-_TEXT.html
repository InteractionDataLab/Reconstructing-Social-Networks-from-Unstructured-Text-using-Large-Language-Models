Bee trials:
Treatment
Before
After
None
Somewhat lethargic. Drank when prompted.
Appeared tired, but otherwise unaffected.
0.00%
Most lethargic, did not eat when offered
Wet and slow moving.
0.05%
Very vigorous; ran around inside the tube. Fed.
Very energetic. Unaffected by treatment.
0.2%
Very vigorous; ran around inside the tube. Fed.
Slightly less energetic than the 0.05% bee.
The bees will be able to survive all of the oxalic acid that the E.coli can produce.

The results we got for antibiotics testing show that biofilms can still be recultured even after being treated with antibiotics.
