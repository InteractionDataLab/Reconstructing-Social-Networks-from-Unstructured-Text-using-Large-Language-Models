Meet Dinula De Silva
I am a grade 12 student at Winston Churchill High School. I enjoy programming, playing the guitar, and watching movies. When I’m not stuck indoors, I like going running and biking. I joined iGEM because the feats of synthetic biology fascinated me and I wanted to learn more about the processes involved. I additionally wanted to develop my computer programming skills by working on the wiki and software aspect of the competition.
I wish I were adenine, because then I could get paired with U ;)

Meet Eyram Asem
Howdy! My name is Eyram and I am in grade 11 at Winston Churchill High School. I joined iGem because I thought that it would be a great opportunity to gain lab experience, learn about synthetic biology, and meet some groovy people; all of which happened! I love reading novels, hanging out with my friends, eating food, and having spontaneous dance parties (with only myself present of course).  I hate the sound of Styrofoam, wearing my glasses, and waking up late.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)

Meet Ronja Kothe
Hello! I’m Ronja Kothe, a student at Winston Churchill High School. This is my second year in iGEM and I have had an amazing time. I joined iGEM because I find the field of synthetic biology very fascinating. I also want to gain more experience in lab work, which is my favourite aspect of iGEM. However, the Human Practices component of iGEM interests me very much as well. In the future I would like to continue to perform experiments and venture out into the biomedical field. In addition to iGEM, I also enjoy playing the clarinet and going camping with my fellow Girl Guides.

Meet Jessica Semmelrock
My name is Jessica Semmelrock. I am seventeen years old. Art and science interest me, which is why I plan to continue studying the subjects in post secondary. I joined the Lethbridge iGEM team because of the unique experience it offers. The opportunity came up a short while after I discovered what synthetic biology is and I was psyched to learn more. It is incredible that a team of high school students and a few advisors can create innovative solutions to world problems. I love getting involved in various activities, including sports, volunteering, and visual arts. A belief I hold close is that learning is the best part of any activity, which makes IGEM all the better.
They told me to choose a chemistry themed pick-up line, but all the good ones argon.

Meet Kaatje O'Donnell
My name is Kaatje and I am in grade 12. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been an experience completely unlike anything else I've done. In the past, I haven't been extremely interested in the sciences, so iGEM has been a great introduction to bio and chem, although I have been more involved in the human practices and ethics side of things. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy competing gymnastics, playing the drums, and writing. I love being a part of iGEM!
Are you full of beryllium, gold, and titanium? Because you are Be-Au-Ti-full ;)

Meet Andy Zhang
Andy Zhang is a Grade 12 high school student who enjoys piña coladas, getting lost in the rain, and referring to himself in the third person. His hobbies include reading reference materials to increase his vocabulary and general knowledge as a way to expand his wordplay. He joined iGEM due to his love for the subjects of biology and chemistry and having the chance to contribute to a project that could have real world consequences, as well as get to know people through community involvement. Editor's Note: Apparently he also likes to talk about himself in the third person.
Are you google? Because you're everything I've been searching for ;)

Meet Arashk Gasroddashti
Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.
When I saw you, it was dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin at first sight ;)

Meet Aum Patel
Hello, I am Aum Patel. I just started my school year as a Grade 11 at Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. This is my first year as part of iGEM. It has been a fascinating and valuable experience. I plan to pursue a career in medical field (but, these plans change every week). Although I live on tight schedule, when I do find the time I like to spend it by travelling, sleeping(mostly), polishing my skills (and counting them), and engaging in programs such as iGEM.
I've got my ion you ;)

Meet Landon Zanewich
My name is Landon Zanewich and I am starting grade eleven this year at LCI. My hobbies include playing video games, board games and card games. I also enjoy playing sports like hockey and volleyball. In my free time I enjoy seeing friends or playing games. I have been playing hockey all my life and have been skating for almost as long as I could walk. I joined IGEM because I wanted to see the power that synthetic biology has to change the world for the better. I am still unsure of what career I will pursue in the future, but I am sure that it will involve science.
You must be awfully cool because you're 0K in my books ;)

Meet Kieran
Hello, my name is Kieran McCormack. I am currently finished my second year of Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge, which allows for a nice contrast between the normal science world and the more defined synthetic biology world. I enjoy doing new activities and have found great joy from being an adviser on the team; whether that be through new friendships, communications or spread of knowledge. I have enjoyed learning about myself throughout this year, and hopefully I can continue to do so into the future.
You're so hot, you might be the cause of global warming ;)

Meet Yoyo
Hello! I am Yoyo and this is my 4th year iGEMing! I was born in China but moved to Canada in 2003. Currently I’m entering third year as a Chemistry major at the University of Lethbridge. As always I come back to iGEM to see the creative ways teams tackle their projects, and to input our own creative projects! Outside of school I enjoy skiing, throwing Frisbees, staring at computer screens for hours on end, and playing Super Smash Bros.
Are you a scientist? Because I lab you ;)

Meet HJ
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
What did one sister chromatid say to the other? Stop copying me!

Meet Brian
I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).
Biochemists do it in triplicate.
