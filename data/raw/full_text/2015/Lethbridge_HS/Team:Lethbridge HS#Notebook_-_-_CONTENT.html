Procedure:Bees were obtained from the “Mighty Hive” near the penitentiary at 4:00 and placed into 5ml centrifuge tubes. The bees were transported to the University of Lethbridge and stored at room temperature until 8:00. Prior to experimentation, the tubes were supplemented with a sugar water solution to ensure that the bees would not starve. Following feeding, 2ml of each treatment were added to the 5ml tubes containing the bees and set horizontally along the bench.

										Biofilms: Results of July 6 Recultured Biofilms, Degradation of July 7 Biofilms and Preparation of New Biofilms for Further Testing

<P>Objective: Determine if yesterday’s recultured biofilms were successful. In addition continue to degrade biofilms using the household cleaners brought into lab for testing and see if we can successfully reculture the biofilms created yesterday.</P><P>Results: Reculturing of the July 6 Biofilms</P><P>We were successful in reculturing the biofilms to varying extents based on the overnight cultures of the degraded RFP biofilms. Based on reference of the biofilm that had been cultured before the cleaners were added, the Truly is the most red in colour. Both bleach and Tilex had a more clear appearncec similar to LB.</P><P>PHOTO</P><P>Procedure: Degrading the July 7 Biofilms</P><P>The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, Tilex, Truly and Fantastic cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.</P><P>Procedure: Reculturing the July 7 Biofilms</P><P>To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well for one of microtiter plate that had been degraded with cleaner.

Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.</P><P>300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate.
