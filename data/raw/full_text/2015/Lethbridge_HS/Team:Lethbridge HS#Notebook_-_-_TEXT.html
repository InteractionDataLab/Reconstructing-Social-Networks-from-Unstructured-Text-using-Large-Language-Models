Lab book June 6
Names: Jonathan Kwan and Kieran McCormack
We stained inoculated biofilms and performed the Crystal Violet assay. Left in 37 C for 36 hours. We did 4 trials 100uL, 4 trials 200uL, and 4 trials 300uL. Biofilm formation was successful, with varying band thickness. We also replicated this with two 5mL LB petri dish inoculated with 20uL E.coli. We added 5mL of crystal violet each to the petri dishes to cover the whole plate.
We also performed an oxalic acid gradient with 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, and 2.0% oxalic acid to give a final volume of 6mL. We added 20uL of E.coli to each 6mL tube. Left in 37 C.
We did a 1/100 dilution of E.coli into LB media, and left it in 37 C for (hopefully) 24 hours. We did 4 trials 100uL, 4 trials 200uL, and 4 trials 300uL.

Objective:Determine if the concentration of oxalic acid that kills bacteria will kill bees.
Procedure:Bees were obtained from the “Mighty Hive” near the penitentiary at 4:00 and placed into 5ml centrifuge tubes. The bees were transported to the University of Lethbridge and stored at room temperature until 8:00. Prior to experimentation, the tubes were supplemented with a sugar water solution to ensure that the bees would not starve. Following feeding, 2ml of each treatment were added to the 5ml tubes containing the bees and set horizontally along the bench. The abdomen of each bee was immersed in the treatment no matter what orientation the bee took. The bees were observed for 1 hour and subsequently euthanized in 70% EtOH.

Table 1. Observations of the bees following 60 minutes of exposure.
Discussion:The bees showed that they could survive well in concentrations of oxalic acid that were above the point where E.coli would die. Further tests must be done to determine the exact contact toxicity. Additionally, the contact toxicity to mites will need to be addressed.
Conclusion:The bees will be able to survive all of the oxalic acid that the E.coli can produce.

Oxalic Acid Gradient and Continued Growth of Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Dinula De Silva,Tiffany Dang, and Kieran McCormack
Bee: A More Specific Oxalic Acid Gradient
Objective: Determine a more specific concentration of oxalic acid that will prevent cell growth. Already we know that oxalic acid prevents cell growth between 0.05% and 0.2%. Now we want to determine a more specific concentration of oxalic acid that will prevent cell growth.

Cells were left in the shaker for 23 hours accidently. ODs were not taken because they had been left in the shaker too long.
Biofilms: Continued Growth of Biofilms.
Objective: Continue to determine what cleaners will destroy/degrade biofilms. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Results: The biofilms did not grow on any of the plates as there was no red ring. Using fresh RFP cultures might fix this issue because the cultures we had used were prepared earlier in the month.

Can Bees Ingest Culture?
Names: Dinula De Silva and Chris Issac
Objective: Determine if bees can ingest E.coli in liquid culture form with supplementation of sugar. Also, can mites survive on papers that have water and RFP liquid culture?
Procedure: Bees were obtained from the “Mighty Hive” near the penitentiary at 6:50 after a heinous struggle and lack of proper equipment. They were then fed RFP producing E.coli that had been supplemented with both glucose and sucrose sugars. The bees were then observed to determine if they were drinking the solution.
Mites were added to petri dishes following a sugar shake. The dishes had different paper derivatives soaked in treatment; H2O and RFP E. coli. They were then placed in the 27C iGEM incubator. They will be observed in the morning.
The bees were euthanized on EtOH, then surface sterilized in bleach, opened using a razor to expose the gut, and placed in LB to shake at 37C overnight. Problem: 50ul of kanamycin was added instead of 5ul. I suppose that’s what happens when you work a 13 hour day in the sun.

Lab book July 6
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Andy Zhang, Dinula De Silva, Ronja Kothe, Tiffany Dang, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: To continue growing biofilms and determine if certain cleaners will prevent further growth of the biofilms
Procedure: Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Bees: Preparing Solutions for Oxalic Acid Gradient using Potassium Permanganate.
Objective: Solutions were prepared to be used for the oxalic acid assay that will see KMnO4 being oxidized by oxalic acid and therefore detect the presence of oxalic acid.
Procedure: To prepare the 1% and 20% Oxalic Acid concentrations, solid oxalic acid was weighed for a solution of 50 mL. 0.5 g of oxalic acid was weighed out and placed in a 50 mL falcon tube. 50 mL of d2H¬2O was added to the falcon tube to dissolve the oxalic acid and  create the 1% Oxalic Acid concentration. Two falcon tubes of 1% Oxalic Acid was prepared.
10 g of oxalic acid was then weighed and dissolved in 50 mL of d2H¬2O in a 50 mL falcon tube for the 20% oxalic acid concentration. The 50 mL of 20% oxalic acid was then placed in the 60˚C oven to help dissolve the oxalic acid.
In addition 1 M H2SO4 was created using stock 5 M for the Wieden Lab. Both the 1 M H2SO4 and 1% oxalic acid were stored in the 4˚C fridge in E770.

Biofilms: Preparing More Biofilms and Reculturing the July 6 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Tiffany Dang, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: To continue growing biofilms for future testing and to determine if biofilms can be recultured from previous ones that had been degraded based on the July 6 biofilms.
Procedure: New Biofilms
New biofilms were created for July 7 testing. Same protocol used as June 30. Instead of using crystal violet dye, we are using E.coli DH5α cells with RFP (PSB4K5). 2 μL of KAN was added to 2 mL centrifuge tubes along with 1980 μL LB and 20 μL of culture.
300 μL of mix was pipetted into wells of 96 well plate. Biofilms left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.
Procedure: Degrading the July 6 Biofilms
The biofilms created yesterday successfully grew. To degrade the biofilms, bleach, Tilex and Truly cleaner solutions were used that had previously been created. The solutions of biofilms were disposed of in the biohazard waste and the microtiter plates placed in water. They were vigoursly shaken to dry and 300 μL of respective cleaning solution added to each well. Since three plates of biofilms were created, each cleaning solution received its on plate. 15 mins after the solutions was added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Procedure: Reculturing the July 6 Biofilms
To culture the biofilms from yesterday, 300 μL of LB media was added to one well of a microtiter plate. The media was then pipette up and down to mix with any remnants of the biofilms. The media was then pipetted back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
Process was repeated for the remaining two plates that used different cleaners.
Note: Before cultures were degraded using the different cleaners, Kieran had taken a sample of the biofilms and prepared a 5 mL tube of LB to culture the biofilm that would be ensured to grow.
Cultures were left to grow 24 hours in 37˚C incubator.

Procedure: Creating Biofilms.
Biofilms were made in 5 35x10 mm Petri dishes by putting 14.85 mL of LB media, 15 μL of KAN, and 150 μL of RFP into a 15 mL falcon tube. 3 mL of this solution was then pipetted into each Petri dish.
These were left in the 37 ˚C incubator for 24 hours so that they could grow.

Results of the Reculturing of July 14 Biofilms
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Anileen Pageni and Kieran McCormack
From the overnight cultures of the July 14 biofilms, the ones recultured after the use of water and Tilex were red confirming we had recultured the two cultures. The one recultured from GreenWorks was also successful. Although not very red, it had an orange tinge indicating the presence of RFP. The Lysol reculture was more yellow in culture colour but might have been successful. The same results as previous for Fantastik showed no culture growth.

Degrading and Reculturing the July 17 Biofilms and a Oxalic Acid Gradient
Names: Anileen Pageni, Sydnee Calhoun, Dinula De Silva, Tiffany Dang and Kieran McCormack
Biofilms
Procedure: Degrading the July 17 Biofilms
The biofilms created on July 17 grew successfully. The solutions used to degrade the biofilms were Mr. Clean and Lysol. 3200 μL of solution was added to each Petri dish. 30 mins after the solutions were added, they were disposed of in the biohazard waste.
Two of the Petri dishes had been degraded. The other three from July 17 were washed with water once before being placed back in the 37 ˚C incubator. The goal of these three biofilms is to see if they can still grow and maintain the RFP biofilms.
Procedure: Reculturing July 17 Biofilms
To reculture the biofilms, 200 μL of LB media was added to one well for each Petri dish that had been degraded with cleaner.
The media was moved around the rim to where the biofilm had formed. Then the media was pipette back into the 5 mL tube of LB media. 5 μL of KAN was added to the 5 mL tube of LB media.
This process was repeated for each of the cleaners listed above in the procedure for degradation of the biofilms. Cultures left in the 37 ˚C shaking incubator
Bee: Oxalic Acid Gradient
Procedure: The procedure for the gradient remains the same as July 9. The concentrations of oxalic acid were quickly added to their respective tubes to minimize differences in time of oxidation.

Results: Reculture of one of the July 17, 2015 biofilms –Day 4
The 5 mL tube of LB media labeled “before” when bleach was not added had RFP cultures growing at the bottom of the tube. This showed that we were able to reculture the biofilm. The 5 mL LB media tube labeled “After” which had been washed with bleach contained no biofilm growth indicating that the bleach had degraded the 4 day old biofilms.

Biofilms: Growing new biofilms
Objective: To growth new biofilms for future testing with various means
Procedure: In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µl of RFP, and 21 µL KAN were pipetted into it and the solution was mixed. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.
Biofilms: Bleach Concentration Gradient
Objective: From our work we are able to determine how effective different cleaners are in degrading biofilms. To test the resilience of the biofilms in another mean, we will test how well the biofilms are degraded at different concentrations of bleach
Procedure:
1.Standard solution of 0.252% bleach was made from the stock bottle for a 50 mL volume
2.The following concentrations had been made from the standard solution of bleach and water. Each concentration was diluted by two folds of the previous solution.
• 0.252% • 0.126% • 0.063% • 0.0315% • 0.01575% • 0.007875% • 0.0039375%
3.The dilutions were made for a 15 mL falcon tube using water and standard bleach solution
4.3.2 mL of one of the bleach dilutions were placed in one the Petri dishes containing biofilms from the previous day. This process was repeated for the other six dilutions.
5.The biofilms were then allowed to degrade for 15 mins.
6.The bleach solutions in each of the Petri dishes was emptied and rinsed once with Milli-Q water.
7.LB media tubes were labeled with one of the bleach solutions. 5 µL of KAN was added to each labeled tube.
8.20 µL of LB from one tube was taken out and placed on the edge of one of the Petri dishes.
9.The media was then placed back into the tube it was taken out of.
10.This process (Steps 8-9) was repeated for the remaining six tubes
11.LB media tubes were placed in the 37˚C incubator for 24 hours.
Bee: Oxalic Acid Gradient
Objective: Continue to test the specificity of the oxalic acid gradient using KMnO4
Procedure: The procedure for the gradient remains the same as July 9. The concentrations of oxalic acid were quickly added to their respective tubes to minimize differences in time of oxidation.

Biofilms: Growing New Biofilms and Control Testing with Different Antibiotics
Names: Sydnee Calhoun, Ronja Kothe, Jonathan Kwan, Anileen Pageni, Aum Patel, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: New biofilms were created so that testing of various sorts could be continued. To make sure the RFP biofilms that have been recultured in the past are actually from the plates, different antibiotics were used to reculture the biofilms. If RFP persisted in the different types of antibiotic we can ensure that the recultures are not our cultures –and therefore no contamination.
Procedure: New Biofilms
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL of LB media, 210 µL of RFP, and 21 µL of KAN was pipetted into it. 3 mL of the solution was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
The Petri dishes were then put in the incubator for 24 hours at 37 ˚C.
Procedure: Reculturing Biofilms
The Day 9 biofilm was recultured by pipetting a proper amount of LB media onto the side of the Petri dish. This was then pipetted back into the 5 mL LB media tube along with 5 µL of KAN.
This was then incubated in the shaker for 24 hours at 37 ˚C.
The biofilms that were treated with the antibiotics KAN (x2), AMP, TET, CAM, IPTG, and water which was used as a control, were recultured 15 minutes after the antibiotics had been removed. They were recultured in the same manner as mentioned above.
These were then also incubated in the shaker for 24 hours at 37˚C.

Antibiotic Testing and Making New Biofilms
Names: : Sydnee Calhoun, Anileen Pageni, and Kieran McCormack
Objective: to test biofilms with antibiotics and to make new biofilms to continue testing on them.
Procedure:
Antibiotics Testing
Biofilms that were incubated for 24 hours were cleaned. In 12 2 mL tubes, 1650 µL of double distilled water was pipetted into each of them. Into 2 2 mL tubes, 3.3 µL of AMP was pipetted into them. This process was repeated for 4 other tubes with CAM and TET. A control with water was also used.
2 of the 2 mL tubes were then placed into a 35x10 mm Petri dish. This was done with 5 other 35x10 mm Petri dishes. 3 of them were rinsed after 15 minutes while the other 3 and the control were rinsed after 30 minutes. These were then recultured by pipetting 100 µL of LB media into the rim of the 35x10 mm Petri dish. It was the put back into the tube along with 5 µL of KAN.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37˚C.
New Biofilms
In a 50 mL falcon tube, 21 mL, 200 µL of E.coli with RFP, and 20 µL of KAN was combined. 3 mL was then pipetted into 7 35x10 mm Petri dishes.
These were then put into the incubator for 24 hours at 37 ˚C.
