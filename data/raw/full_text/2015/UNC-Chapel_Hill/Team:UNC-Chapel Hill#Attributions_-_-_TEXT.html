General Support
We would like to thank our advisors and mentors: Shawn Gomez, Victor Tse, Bryan Johnson, and Erin Borchardt, for providing all our team members the opportunity to participate in iGEM. Each of these academics contributed a great deal in introducing us to iGEM and providing us a structured environment to get the team going.
Project support and advice
The aforementioned advisors also contributed heavily to our brainstorming process. When problems came up, they helped us troubleshoot and regain our foothold in lab. For example, they helped us come up with a new protocol for assembling our parts together that ultimately allowed us to advance in the project.
Fundraising help and advice
Our advisors and mentors also contributed to our fundraising efforts by assisting in the bake sales and in recruiting donations.
Lab support
Our advisors additionally helped troubleshoot all other non-wetlab issues in lab. Also, a special thanks to Dr. Shawn Gomez and the whole Biomedical Engineering department at Chapel Hill for providing our team with our own lab space in MacNider Hall at UNC.
We would also like to extend a thanks to IDT for synthesizing our DNA and EtonBio for sequencing our DNA.
Presentation coaching
The aforementioned advisors also helped us prepare for our presentation by watching and critiquing our powerpoint.
Human Practices support
We would like to thank Al Stanback Middle School for allowing us to have a lesson on various science topics.
We would also like to thank Mr. and Mrs. Zhang for donating a video camera so that we could record our protocol videos.
