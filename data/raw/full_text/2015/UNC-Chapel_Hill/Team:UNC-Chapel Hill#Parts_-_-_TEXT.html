Selected Parts
Part BBa_K1838003: MLC4
This part contains the palindromic binding site for the protein MLC encoded by the gene dgsA, a gene native to E. coli. Specifically, MLC is a repressor regulator for many phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTSs). In this part, the binding site is found upstream of the base promoter used for construction, BBa_J23110
Part BBa_K1838005: MLC2 w/ Yellow Chromoprotein
This composite part features our MLC2 construct combined via 3A assembly with a yellow chromoprotein+RBS part (BBa_K1033931). During transcription, the MLC2 binding site is bound by the protein MLC, inhibiting production of yellow chromoprotein. As glucose concentration increases in the cell, more MLC is uptaken and bound to the membrane by a mechanism involving the transmembrane glucose permease called IICBGlu. This means that higher glucose concentrations subsequently result in higher expression levels of the yellow chromoprotein and thus makes it a glucose-inducible chromoprotein producing part. Specifically, this part tests the hypothesis for how MLC affects the inducibility of a strong promoter when placed upstream of the base promoter sequence.
Part BBa_K1838006: MLC3 w/ Yellow Chromoprotein
This composite part features our MLC2 construct combined via 3A assembly with a yellow chromoprotein+RBS part (BBa_K1033931). During transcription, the MLC2 binding site is bound by the protein MLC, inhibiting production of yellow chromoprotein. As glucose concentration increases in the cell, more MLC is uptaken and bound to the membrane by a mechanism involving the transmembrane glucose permease called IICBGlu. This means that higher glucose concentrations subsequently result in higher expression levels of the yellow chromoprotein and thus makes it a glucose-inducible chromoprotein producing part. Specifically, this part tests the hypothesis for how MLC affects the inducibility of a weak promoter when placed downstream of the base promoter sequence.
Part BBa_K1838008: Glucose Inducible w/ Blue Chromoprotein Construct
This composite part features the glucose inducible promoter BBa_K861171 combined via 3A assembly with a blue chromoprotein+RBS part (BBa_K1073021).  This part is meant to be placed into the tri-color glucose detection composite part in order to contribute increasing levels of blue protein as glucose concentration rises.
