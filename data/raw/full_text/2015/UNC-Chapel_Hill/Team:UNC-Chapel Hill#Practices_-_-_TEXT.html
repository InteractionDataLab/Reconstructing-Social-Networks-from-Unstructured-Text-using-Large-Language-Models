iGEM Laboratory Techniques Video Series
As one of our community outreach projects, we decided to create a short video series demonstrating basic laboratory techniques commonly used by our team this summer. We hope these videos can serve as an instructional tool for future iGEM teams as well for a synthetic biology laboratory course offered here at UNC-Chapel Hill!
Gel Electrophoresis
Nano-Drop
DNA Sequencing
Centrifuge
Plating Bacterial Cultures

Presentation to Aspiring STEM Students
In addition to the education of our peers, we also believe that it is important to educate those of the next generation. At Al Stanback Middle School, we spoke to a group of aspiring STEM students about the use of recombinant DNA including how our group was using it. Several of our members talked about other research projects they were involved with such 3-D printed prosthetics and epigenetic factors of congenital heart disease.
