PCR solutions were composed of 3 uL 10ng/uL template DNA, 1/2 part F. primer, 1/2 part R. primer, 5 parts 5X Phusion HF Buffer, 1/4 part dNTPs (10mM) and 15.5 parts USP H<SUB>2</SUB>O. For all our parts, we utilized the forward primer 5’ ACC GAC TCT CCG TTG CGT TAA G 3’and reverse primer 5’ TAA GGG TCA CTG GGC GAT ATT CG 3’. Both of the primers were determined to have a melting temperature of approximately 59°C according to the OLIGOANYLYZER 3.1 on IDT’s website.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER><CENTER><TABLE width="975" cellspacing="4" height="115px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="100%" height="4px" bgcolor="#c9def2"><H3 style="color:#56A0D3; font-size:30px">Transformation</H3><P> E. coli cells were thawed slowly in ice. After reaching a liquid state, 20 μL of cells were pipetted into clean autoclaved 1.7 mL tubes. Next, 2 μL of DNA was added (plasmids from kit or ligation mixtures) and mixed in tubes by gently pipetting up and down. The mixture was then incubated on ice for half an hour. Cells were then heat shocked for 30 seconds at 42°C and then placed on ice again for five minutes. 500 μL of pre-heated 37°C SOC media was added to the cells and placed in a shaker at 37 °C for one hour. The cells were then pipetted onto the LB plates that had the corresponding antibiotic for the vector.

For both of these cases, 5x the volume of the solutions intended for purification was added in the form of DNA binding buffer and the total new solution was loaded on Zymo-Spin columns. These columns were then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 seconds and washed with 200 uL of DNA Wash Buffer for 30 seconds at 14,000 x g. The wash step was then repeated and the columns were transferred to clean 1.7 mL tubes. These DNA in this columns was eluted with 15 mL USP H<SUB>2</SUB>O and allowed to rest for five minutes.

First the DNA from the liquid culture was pelleted into a 1.7 mL tube using a 16,000 x g spin. Then 200 μL of P1 Buffer was added and mixed well to resuspend the pellet. 200 μL of P2 Buffer followed this and was mixed via gentle inversion of the tubes. The total mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 minutes. Next, 400 μL of P3 buffer was added and mixed via gentle inversion The mixture was then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 2 minutes and the supernatant was added to the ZYMO spin column. The mixture was then centrifuged for 30 seconds at 14,000 x g into a collection tube. 200 μL of Endo-Wash Buffer was added and then centrifuged for 30 seconds at 14,000 x g. Then 400 μL of Plasmid Wash Buffer was added and centrifuged for one minute at 14,000 x g.

Then 1 μL of ethidium bromide was added to the solution. The solution was then poured into the molding and cooled until it formed a gel (a comb was added immediately afterwards to create the wells). Once the gel was cooled, it was reoriented so that the wells were on the negative side of the apparatus. 1X TAE buffer was added to the external wells so that it slightly overflowed and covered the gel. The gel was then ready for DNA. The DNA in this experimental design were all cut with EcoRI and PstI, combined with DNA loading dye (1 to 5 ratio) and inserted into the gel. The gels were run for one hour at 120 mV, then analyzed under a High Performance UV Transilluminator made by the company UVP.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER><FOOTER><A href="#" class="go-top">Top</A></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
