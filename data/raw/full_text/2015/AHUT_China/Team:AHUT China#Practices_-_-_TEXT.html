Our team have made a lot of vivid and detailed introductions which involved in some interesting knowledge about syenthetic biology to the freshman. During the period of  publicity ,they showed great enthusiasm and asked questions actively, we answered each of the various questions about IGEM with patience. At the same time,our team members have also given several presentations to let them experience the atmosphere of final competition.
New Power
Time: 2015.9.10-2015.9.12
Location: A high school in  Maanshan City  Anhui Province, China
In order to expand the influence of IGEM, we have gone to high school to explain the knowledge about synthetic biology and our project for students who were in military training. They were all interested in IGEM and we have also made several biological experiments with them, which expressed them a lot about synthetic biology and IGEM.
Questionnaire
Percentage Calculation Method of Multiple Choice Questions. Percentage=Times of Chosen\Marks of Effective Answer Sheet.It means the proportion of people who chose one answer in number of those who filled in the questionnaire. So the percentage addition of multiple choice questions may beyond one hundred percent.
Ⅰ. Questionnaire survey, about 36.08% of people think that biotechnology effects on human life has a positive effect, 58.08% of people believe that at the same time has a positive and the negative side, only 2.4% of people hold a negative attitude. In life science research should focus on what aspects of the issue, the answer is most of the medical and health and environmental protection. And about synthetic biology or igem, only very few people have a deep understanding to them (6.29%), the vast majority of people say never concern (78.74%) or have been focused on (14.97%). This suggests that people support the development of biotechnology, but understanding of synthetic biology is not too much.
At the same time, related health problems, according to the results of the survey about 87.72% of people have the consciousness of prevention of disease, but don't know much about the knowledge of all kinds of diseases and health. In choosing drugs, 85.33% natural medicine, more trust that natural medicine has the side effect is small, cure the disease and low relative to the synthetic drug price advantages. When asked about when we improve the effective ingredients of natural medicine program, about 80% of people backed, think this is raising the popularity of natural medicines, conducive to disease control and prevention, and promote the positive role in drug development.
Ⅱ. Questionnaire survey shows that people support the development of biotechnology, think life science research should be more focus on two aspects of medical and health and environmental protection. But for synthetic biology or IGEM, but not many people know about. At the same time, on health, the vast majority of people have awareness of disease prevention, but not for all kinds of diseases and health knowledge too much understanding. When people is choosing drugs more trust in natural medicine, think they have a lot of advantage. And about our project to increase the effective components in natural drugs output, people is more of a support attitude.
MOOC
The number of students who accessed our mooc study platform has reached to 70,000.
Our courses consist of seven major sections—iGEM’s introduction, modern molecular biology, synthetic biology, bioinformatics, current protocols, wiki web making and iGEM’s information search. We have created a comprehensive course system which is good at deepening students’ understanding of our courses.
Our MOOC videos consist of iGEM’s introduction, basics of synthetic biology and design of WIKI making with the view of letting more people be involved in iGEM by learning our online courses!
iGEM was founded by MIT in 2003. It is a top international academic competition in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims to re-design the current natural biological system and build artificial biological parts and system to create a new biological system. The design and making of WIKI has given us the most humanistic vision experience and offered us an optimal project display platform with the interaction of science and humanity.
Besides our teaching materials, we have also made our teaching videos to help people get to know more about our project. Some relevant questions have also been given to assist students to strengthen what they’ve learned.
