           Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase，PAL can catalyze L-phenylalanine’s deaminization to produce cinnamate. It serves as the enzyme that links primary metabolism, phenylaprapanoid metabolism and catalytic phenylaprapanoid metabolism in the first phase. It is also the key and rate-limiting enzyme in metabolic pathway of phenylalanine.
      </P><P class="sec_p">
           PAL plays an important role in the pathway of producing compound Acyl phenylethyl alcohol glycosides from Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch and in the process of producing cinnamate by phenylalanine’s deaminization. It has greatly limited the expression of the whole synthetic pathway. Besides, by inducing the high expression of PAL, it has made a large amount of cinnamate from phenylalanine be involved in the next synthetic pathway to increase the expression of compound Acyl phenylethyl alcohol glycosides.
      </P><P class="sec_p">
          In Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, the compound of APeGs can synthesize the key compound and can be available by being combined in the pathways of phenylalanine and tyrosine respectively with chorismate through the precursor way. In the pathway of phenylalanine, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase serves as a very important key enzyme in the procedure of Phenylalanine’s turning into cinnamate. It can catalyze phenylalanine’s deaminization to produce cinnamate, and then involve in the later procedures of synthesis.

       After the agrobacterium has been transformed and the plant has been cultivated for a while, we determinated the content of verbascoside in transgenic Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch by HPLC-PDA, to verify that the plants containing the target gene can highly express specified products.  
       The specific steps are as follows.
Preparing standard solutions: 50 mg of verbascoside standards are weighted and taken to 50 mL with methanol of 50% mass concentration. Then standard solutions of 2.5, 5, 10 and 100 µg·mL<SUP>-1</SUP> are diluted respectively for standby;
Drawing a standard curve chart: Testing verbascoside standard solutions of different concentrations prepared in step one by HPLC-PDA. Drawing a standard curve chart of peak area Y and standards content X with linear equation of Y = 34731X - 9296.6，R 2  =0.9997 with µg as the unit of standards content. Linear regression analysis shows that the concentration of verbascoside is between 2.5 µg·mL<SUP>-1</SUP> and 100 µg·mL<SUP>-1</SUP> with a good linear relationship between peak area Y and standards content X;
Determinating the content of verbascoside in Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch: Taking the transgenic Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch after selection and cultivation into the oven of 40℃. Dry it into constant weight and ground into powder. Selecting the powder with 0.45mm sieve and extracting 1g powder after sieving with 18 mL methanol ultrasonic of 50% mass concentration. After that, taking 25mL of the supernatant and measuring the peak area of verbascoside with HPLC-PDA. The linear equation in step two can be used to calculate the content of verbascoside.
The result proves that the content of verbascoside in normal non-transgenic Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch is 1.27 mg·g<SUP>-1</SUP>, while in transgenic Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch of RgPAL1, the content reaches 3.27 mg·g<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is 2.57 times of that in non-transgenic Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch.
