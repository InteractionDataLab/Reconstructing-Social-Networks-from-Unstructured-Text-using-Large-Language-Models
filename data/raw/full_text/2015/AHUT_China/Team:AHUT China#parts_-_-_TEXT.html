RgPAL1（ BBa_K1751000 ）
The gene RgPAL1 can express Phenylalanine ammonia lyase（PAL）, which is an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction converting L-phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid.PAL is the first and committed step in the phenyl propanoid pathway and is therefore involved in the biosynthesis of the polyphenol compounds. In our project, PAL plays an important role in L-phenylalanine’s deaminization to produce trans-cinnamic acid.  Phenylalanine ammonia lyase is specific for L-Phe, and to a lesser extent, L-Tyrosine. The reaction catalyzed by PAL is the spontaneous, non-oxidative deamination of L-phenylalanine to yield trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia.
L-phenylalanine
trans-cinnamate + NH3
The cofactor 3,5-dihydro-5-methyldiene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) is involved in the reaction and sits atop the positive pole of three polar helices in the active site, which helps to increase its electrophilicity.MIO is reported to attack the aromatic ring of L-Phe in a Friedel-Crafts-type reaction, which activates the C-H bond and leads to cleavage of the bond. The carbanionintermediate formed by this mechanism is stabilized by partial positive regions in the active site. The mechanism of the reaction of PAL is thought to be similar to the mechanism of the related enzyme histidine ammonia lyase.PAL is inhibited by trans-cinnamic acid, and, in some species, may be inhibited trans-cinnamic acid derivatives.D-Phe and D-Tyr are competitive inhibitors.
Promotor-RBS
Promotor-RBS（ BBa_K847100 ）
This part contains a constitutive promoter and strong RBS. The strength of this RBS is considered relative to BBa_B0031, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0033 and BBa_B0034. While the promotor is a member of a family of constitutive promotor parts labelled J23100 through J23119.

Plasmid
pSB1C3
High copy BioBrick assembly plasmid
pSB1C3 is a high copy number plasmid (RFC [10]) carrying chloramphenicol resistance.
The replication origin is a pUC19-derived pMB1 (copy number of 100-300 per cell).
pSB1C3 has terminators bracketing its MCS which are designed to prevent transcription from *inside* the MCS from reading out into the vector. The efficiency of these terminators is known to be < 100%. Ideally we would construct a future set of terminators for bracketing a MCS that were 100% efficient in terminating both into and out of the MCS region.
Usage and Biology
In Spring 2011, pSB1C3 was sequenced using several primers: Pre-R, Suff-F, VF2, VR, and internal primers for the origin and resistance. The reference sequence below matches the most recent sequencing verification of pSB1C3 (w/ BBa_J04450, located in SP 4000 Well 2A).
