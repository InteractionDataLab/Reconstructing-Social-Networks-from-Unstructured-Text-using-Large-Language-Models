The 2015 UBC iGEM team created a system that produces catalytically active Cch2, a chlorohydrolase able to convert the toxic metabolite 6-CNA into the harmless intermediate 6-HNA.
We have used this system to show that E.coli expressing cch2 was able to rapidly detoxify media containing high amounts 6-CNA.  This system applied inside the bee’s intestinal tract by using an engineered probiotic bacterium may render bees resistant to the toxic effects of the degradation product of imidacloprid.
Future Directions:
Moving forward, we have two major objectives to improve our system:
Modification of our nicC and nicX constructs to show that soluble overexpression is possible. Our first strategy would be to increase the strength of the ribosome binding site, using the Salis lab ribosome binding site calculator and optimization algorithms.
Reduce the metabolic burden of our composite parts: First, by increasing the transcriptional repression of our constructs by providing stronger expression of lacI. Another strategy would be to switch to a weaker and more easily tunable promoter system such as the arabinose inducible Pbad promoter system.
