A queen bee lives the longest of all the bees.
How long does a queen bee live for?
A. 1-2 months
B. 2-11 months
C. 1-4 years
D. 5+ years
C. 1-4 years
It takes 12 bees their entire lives to make a teaspoon of honey for the beekeeper to harvest. The rest of the honey they produce is used to maintain the hive.
What percentage of fruit and vegetable flowers are directly pollinated by bees?
A. ~10%
B. ~20%
C. ~30%
D. ~50%
C. ~30%
Some of these plants include cocoa, coffee, cotton, mangoes, and avacados.
What percentage of beekeepers are commercial beekeepers (fulltime beekeepers)?
A. 50%
B. 20%
C. 10%
D. 1%
D. 1%
Most beekeeper are hobby beekeepers and only own or work on a few hives.
How many eggs does the queen bee lay per day?
A. 50-100
B. 200-500
C. 1000-3000
D. 4000-7000
C. 1000-3000
Fertilized eggs will hatch into female worker bees, while unfertilized eggs will become drones or honey bee males.
What is the agricultural value of honeybee pollination in the US?
A. $15 million
B. $50 million
C. $15 billion
D. $50 billion
C. $15 billion
Pollination by honey bees is as vital to the production of many crops as water and sunlight, with association with the production of seeds that will have worldwide distribution.
Which species of bees are used for commercial pollinating purposes?
A.Honey Bees
B. Carpenter Bees
C. Bumble Bees
D. All the bees!
A. Honey Bees
Honey bees are good pollinators for many reasons. Their hairy bodies trap pollen and carry it between flowers. Their body size enables them to pollinate flowers of many different shapes and sizes. The pollination potential of the bees is increased because they can be managed to develop high populations
According to CAPA, What Percent Wintering Loss has Canada experienced in 2013/2014?
A. 15%
B. 25%
C.  35%
D.  5%
B. 25%
The level of winter loss varied among provinces, regions within each province and from beekeeper to beekeeper within each region. Responses from provincial surveys indicated that weather, poor queens, weak colonies in fall, Nosema, Varroa and pesticides were possible causes of reported wintering losses.
When did CCD arise in USA?
A. 1997
B. 2001
C. 2006
D.2002
D. 2002
The losses of colonies since 2002 have left the continent with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the past 50 years.
Which causes contribute to CCD?
A. Changing environment
B. Mite activity (Varroa destructor) and parasites  (Nosema)
C. Use of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides
D. All of the above and potentially others
D. All of the above and potentially others
It has been found that there is no single cause to CCD.
