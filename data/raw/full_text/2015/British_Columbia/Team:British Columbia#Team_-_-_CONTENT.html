With so many tools in the genetic toolbox, we are almost in the time and age to create anything we can imagine. This mindset is what I see a lot in iGEM: students excited to create projects that push the envelope of what we can do in genetics. Having been on the UBC iGEM team last year and going to Boston for the Giant Jamboree allowed me to see just what brilliant ideas are out there to try and explore. I initially decided to be involved with iGEM to get exposure to the field of genetic engineering and see what it has to offer. I hope to continue that this year by helping this team and seeing what my peers have conjured up in their projects. </P><H6>Why do you like bees?</H6><P>Since a very young age, I have had an obsession with insects. Entomology has always been fascinating to me for some reason. While all of my peers irked at the sight of ants and beetles, I would always pick them up and play around with them in my hands. There's something marvelous about how these little critters have grown to populate and diversify our planet. This is especially true for bees, whose existence still fascinates me. Whether it be their intricate relationship with pollination, their unique flight patterns, or their sophiscated hive system, bees are an example of beautifuly complex yet simple creatures. Their role is so integral to the natural &quot;web&quot; (pun-intended) of many ecosystems. And as a human, I admire bees for their dedication and selflessness in the workforce. </P><H6>Random fact about yourself</H6><P>USMNT, COYS, and TM87!

Sure, reading about a transformation is pretty cool, but performing one yourself beats regurgitating the theory on an exam any day. Also, engineering bacteria to do things for you is pretty rad. Definitely rad.</P><H6>Why do you like bees?</H6><P>I like bees because they maintain both ecological diversity and our modern food system. They're the real MVPs when it comes to pollinating the world's flowering plant species as well as agricultural crops like our fruits and veggies. Bees are also cute and fluffy (insert photo of adorable bumblebee here).</P><H6>Random fact about yourself</H6><P>I have a small scar on the right-most side of my right eye, which I got from that one time I scraped the entire right side of my face trying to dive and score a goal.</P></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="hexagon"><SPAN id="seven"><H4>Kevin Ng</H4><P id="year">4th year, Microbiology &amp; Immunology Honours</P><P>Kevin contributed to Modeling, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.</P><H6>Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?</H6><P>It was the multidisciplinary aspect of it that appealed to me - it's so much more fun to work with people outside your area, I think, and to have that constant process of learning and explaining is really great.</P><H6>Why do you like bees?</H6><P>They're cute and fluffy, and the black-yellow colour combination is bold and graphic without being obnoxiously loud.</P><H6>Random fact about yourself</H6><P>I was terrible at biology in high school.

Try as we may, there is no way that anything can substitute a bees ability to pollinate and also drive evolutionary change.
Remove bees from the equation, and expect the world to come crashing down, one species at a time.
I appreciate that power.</P><H6>Random fact about yourself</H6><P>Sometimes my bellybutton lint looks like Texas</P></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="hexagon"><SPAN id="nine"><H4>Milagros Sempere</H4><P id="year">3rd year, Biochemistry Honours</P><P>Milagros contributed to 6-CNA Degradation, Probeeotic Prototype Testing, and Policy and Practices.</P><H6>Why did you decide to get involved in iGEM?</H6><P>I had heard really positive things about iGEM before applying and upon further investigation I realized it is an incredible opportunity to participate in scientific research. I was drawn to iGEM because it is carried out in a team environment, which I really enjoy, and all members work collaboratively in multiple aspects of the project. In a way, this makes a iGEM as realistic of a research experience as possible and it is also lots of fun! </P><H6>Why do you like bees?</H6><P>In my opinion, not only are bees rather fascinating insects but also indispensable; they are a key pollinator of numerous fruits and vegetables that I, along with most of society, love and eat regularly.

From conducting experiments in the lab, hosting human practices workshops, modeling and fundraising, iGEM has proven to teach students more than the basics of research. In addition, the UBC iGEM team is home to many young and congenial scientists, making the work environment a fun and exciting one. Due to the amount of things iGEM teaches you and the work environment that is fosters, joining UBC iGEM was a no brainer for me!</P><H6>Why do you like bees?</H6><P>I like kiwifruit.
