Functional metagenomic approaches were designed to screen large-insert environmental fosmid libraries obtained from the Hallam lab at UBC for an imidacloprid-degrading phenotype. This approach does not depend on previous knowledge of enzymes involved in imidacloprid degradation, and might target imidacloprid degrading enzymatic pathways which further can be incorporated in bee gut microorganisms.

Studies have shown that the use of this pesticide has adverse, and commonly fatal, effects on insects. Unfortunately, honeybees are also affected by imidacloprid. As such, imidacloprid has been cited as one of many factors contributing to colony collapse disorder (CCD). Previous work has been done to characterize enzymes capable of modifying imidacloprid into less toxic products. Out of all cited enzymes, three candidate enzymes were chosen due to their ability to modify imidacloprid and confer partial resistance to their hosts. Experiments were conducted to create bacterial strains containing the enzymes and to test their ability to modify imidacloprid into less toxic products.

Our degradation pathway allows for the formation of a TCA cycle intermediate, fumaric acid, which can be utilized in central metabolism. To potentially aid in the increased survival of honey bees from the effects of imidacloprid, our probeeotic must be capable of not only modifying imidacloprid, but also detoxifying the 6-CNA breakdown product. This is achieved by degradation by <I>cch2</I> and the <I>nic</I> cluster. <I>cch2</I> has been isolated from <I>Bradyrhizobiaceae</I> SG-6C and the <I>nic</I> cluster has been isolated from <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> KT2440.  </P> Click <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia/6CNA">here</A> to read more.</DIV><DIV class="tab-pane" id="e"><P align="justify">In order to test the viability of our probeeotic, experiments on honeybees gut colonization with <I>E. coli</I> containing pesticide-degrading genes were designed and conducted. First, the bee gut colonization was verified after feeding bees a sucrose-water solution supplemented with <I>E. coli</I>. Second, experiments testing colonization of the bee gut with <I>E. coli</I>, harboring pesticide-degradating genes were performed. Bee gut colonization experiments were designed to mimic the real-life situation of how the probeeotic would be delivered to the bees through a sucrose-water solution in the hive environment.
