Bee Infographs LT50∝DtP
where:
LT50 = time when half the insects succumb to toxin
D = dose of toxin per unit time
P = power law exponent
Our determination of the toxicity threshold is derived from Haber’s rule
C x t = k
where
C = concentration of gas
t = time necessary to inhale gas to produce toxic effect
k = constant, dependent on gas itself and toxic effect
However, one caveat in the use of Haber’s rule is in that it applies to inhalation only, but imidacloprid ingestion in A. mellifera can occur through inhalation (direct dust exposure) or oral ingestion of droplets, nectar, or pollen from treated plants.
As such, we have used the toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model proposed by Rondeau et al.
where
D(t) = either a single initial dose or a continuous, lower, chronic dose
C = change in total-body toxic load
τM = metabolic decay time
CB = amount of bound toxin
τD = time constant for dissociation
Mass of receptor-bound imidacloprid and baseline unbound imidacloprid in honeybees with and without engineered bacteria
CB, the amount of bound toxin, can be determined by
where
C = change in total-body toxic load
CB = amount of bound toxin
τA = time constant for receptor binding
τD = time constant for dissociation
Rondeau et al. also suggest that
E(t)∝∫CBdt
where
E(t) = cumulative damaging biological effect
Using an arbitrary threshold for E(t) (e.g. 1 = LT50), we are able to determine cumulative toxicity both without imidacloprid (thick blue line), with imidacloprid (dashed red line), and with imidacloprid and our genetically engineered Gilliamella (dashed blue line).
For the generation of our cumulative toxicity graphs, we used literature values of 6-CNA decay (time constant = 10 hours), as well as known concentrations of bee gut flora (107 bacteria, of which Gilliamella makes up 12%), bee gut volume (1mm x 1mm x 1cm).
We then conducted sensitivity analysis, determining a) the range of the concentration of bacteria added, and b) the range of concentration of imidacloprid needed to alter bee survival time (as defined by our threshold of 1 = LT50).
