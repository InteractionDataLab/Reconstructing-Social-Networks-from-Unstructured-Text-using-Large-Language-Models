To retroactively enhance our project, the effects of our lab work on society were evaluated through the continuous process of reaching out to our stakeholders in the policy and practices section. In this journey, a variety of opinions were presented on colony collapse, pesticide use, and bee health. Informational interviews were conducted with our stakeholders, allowing us to learn about the general perception of our probeeotic if released for consumption, the potential tie of the product with GMOs, and the technical aspects of beekeeping. 



So, how did our policies and practices tie this back to our project?
</P><U>Perception of our Final Product</U>
In the interview with Genome BC, the looming GMO label by society in our project was addressed. We discussed how this might prevent our probeeotic from being a success. Moreover, through our outreach activities at both Science World and UBC Farm’s Saturday Market, we encountered members of the public who asked questions about GMOs. 


In order to avoid the GMO stigma, a careful presentation of our prototype will be required if released for bee consumption. Additionally, the UBC biosafety office was consulted on how the product would be classified and the Environmental Risk Assessment was written. 
<U>Targeted Outreach and Education Activities</U>
By interviewing a wide range of stakeholders, we were able to focus our outreach activities to target knowledge gaps that they had identified. For example, Hank Margraf, a horticulturalist from BC Tree Fruits, mentioned that there may be a knowledge gap in the growing community regarding the impact of CCD on agriculture. Similarly, interviews with other stakeholders suggested that the general public in BC may not fully understand the bee death issue, and that the media attention to the culprit of bee death was disproportionate, focusing mostly on neonicotinoid use. 

Identifying these knowledge gaps led us to formulating two outreach activities: both of which raised awareness about CCD and the importance of bees -  while the Science World activity targeted a more science-minded audience while the UBC Farmer’s Market activity targeted a more growing-minded audience. 

In addition, we were interviewed by Heather Amos from UBC News, who wrote a story about our project and CCD. The media release was released on September 18th at <A href="http://news.ubc.ca/"> UBC News</A>. Primarily, we discussed causes of bee death, the importance of neonicotinoid use in agriculture and its portrayal in the media, as well as how our project aims to address bee death by increasing the specificity of neonicotinoids to pests only. 

By consulting our stakeholders before carrying out outreach activities, we believe that our activities had a stronger, more targeted impact. Furthermore, our outreach was better informed given that we had a broader understanding of the issue.
