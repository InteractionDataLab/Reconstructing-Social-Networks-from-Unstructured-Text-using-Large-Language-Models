"Awards are so unnecessary, because I think we get so much out of our work just by doing it. The work is a reward in itself."

Medal Fulfillment
This page provides a brief outline of our team's medal completion progress, as per the iGEM judging guidelines found here . Our team's judging form entry may be found here . For more details, please visit the respective subpages of our wiki.
Gold Medal
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project.
[See our Human Practices page to have a look at our Educational Workshop .]
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
[See our Registry Update of BBa_299812 on how we updated characterisation of this part]
Silver Medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
[We have created BBa_K1804001 , documented and submitted this composite part to the parts Registry.]
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. [See our Human Practices page for more information on the Educational Workshop that we conducted for a group of undergraduates.]
Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2015 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
[See our Attributions page for details on our project breakdown.]
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
[Refer to our Project page for documentation of a new standard part BBa_K1804002.]
