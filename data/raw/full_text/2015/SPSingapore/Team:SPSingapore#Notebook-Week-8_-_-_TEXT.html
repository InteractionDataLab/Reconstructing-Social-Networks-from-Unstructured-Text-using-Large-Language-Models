Trial run of anaerobe chamber
open sachet to decrease O2 at 3.30pm
takes 2.5h to activate
streak plate of P. putida a strict aerobe and E. coli, facultative aerobe in chamber at 30deg C to grow O/N
P. putida is an obligate aerobe and if chamber works ,it will not grow
E. coli should grow in both conditions
controls grown outside chamber

Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yan Ting & Yun Ting ☀
Colony PCR of invasin
▶ Picked out 8 colonies (marked 1-8) from BBa_K299812 plate stored at 4deg (Adrian, 12/7). Colony PCR using prefix suffix primers for first 4 rxn and universal primers VP & VF2 for last 4 rxn. Used thermocycler "Colony" protocol.
▶ Also constituted dNTP w 2.5mM of each atcg triphosphate.

Transformation of ligated FNRgfp plasmid into dH5alpha
Cleaned waterbath, de-iced the fridge. Today, we also did a spring cleaning for the lab

10am : Placed BBa_K299812 plate in incubator for overnight growth.
3pm : 100V at 30min. Ladder, 4 prefix suffix rxn, 4 universal primers rxn. Saved as “7.15_inv colony”. When I ran for longer (after storing gel at 4deg), the bands were longer but the 250bp marker as well as the primer-dimers are pretty close to dye front.

No colonies grew
Ran a gel, FNRgfp pcr, gfp pcr, fnr, 100bp ladder
▶ Seems to be band shift.
Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yan Ting & Yun Ting ☀
Colony PCR of 8 colonies (marked A-H) from BBa_K299812 plate, and also spotted on a save plate. Both plates placed back in incubator.
Primer conc=0.5 uM, template DNA dissolved in 10ul h20.
Thermocycler “colony_inv” protocol, with adjusted extension time and annealing time&temp from standard “colony” protocol.
100V for 34min. Tubes 1-2: FP-prefix, RP-suffix. 3-4: FP-VF2, RP-VR. 5-6: FP-prefix, RP_Inv_M2. 7-8: RP-suffix, FP_Inv_M1. No template control with FP-prefix, RP-suffix.
[Note: RP_M2 = FP_M2. Check future uses agn seq on the primer master file. Just in case, the sequence used in this expt is INV_FP_M2->GCTCATTATAGTCCGCGAAATCACG].
Gel image saved as “7.17_inv colony.sgd”
Results:
▶ Tubes 3&4 with universal primers VF2 VR have a band between 4&5kb - Inv+LLO is 4.1kb, probably are positive colonies.
▶ Tubes 1&2, 5&6 have bands <750bp as well as primer dimers (but the annealing temperature was calculated for prefix suffix primers not universal ones…I’ll try thermo-gradient thermocycler protocol next time). Expected band size for 5&6 (FP-prefix, RP_Inv_M2 (ends 1928)) = 1.9kb.
▶ No bands for tubes 7&8. Expected band size for 7&8 (RP-suffix, FP_Inv_M1 (starts 1046)) = 2.2kb.
