"Many of us are more capable than some of us . . . but none of us is as capable as all of us!"
- Tom Wilson
The Team Members
We are a group of undergraduates from the Special Programme in Science (SPS), National University of Singapore. SPS was established in 1996 to groom budding scientists towards research and the interdisciplinary sciences.
The team members are engaged in a variety of research activities across a diverse span of fields ranging from bioinformatics to pharmacology and even neuroscience.
