▪ July 19
Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yi Han ☀
Inoculation of positive colonies in liquid culture. 3mL and shaking incubation.
inoculated colonies C,D for invasin plasmid in 3mL LB+amp at 1.30pm
Transformed remaining 40u ligation reaction for FNR gfp into 10ul BL21
Transformed 100ng pGFPuv plasmid into 10ul BL21
Poured new LB+amp plates
Plated 20, 40, 100ul of transformed bacteria in SOC media on plates

Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yun Ting ☀
Miniprep of positive colonies from 30h liquid culture.
Eluted in 50ul elution buffer and stored at -20.
▶ C= 225.9ng/ul. 260/280=1.86
▶ D= 297.7ng/ul. 1.87
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
1. pGFPuv transformation worked!
2. Single colony for FNR-GFP + 4 more from plating on 19/7
3. Sent FNR-GFP fusion product for sequencing with RP-Biobricks Suffx - result there is no FNR but there is no GFP
4. Colony PCR for FNR gfp (Colonies 1-5, (-) control)

▶ Results Notes: Too much template DNA (~250ng). Separate the universal primers (to avoid differing extension time).

Ran gel for 20/7 colony pcr for FNR gfp
1kb, 100bp, colonies negative control
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
Redid colony pcr for above as negative control had a positive band - contamination of PCR
negative control still has band - reagents contaminated

Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yan Ting ☀
RE digest of inv/hyl plasmid with EcoRI and PstI for 2 hours at 37oC.
▶ Lane 1-4: 1kb ladder, 100bp ladder, RE of colony C, RE of colony D.
▶ Size is correct: 4kb main band (inv+hly part) and 2kb (plasmid backbone). These plasmid DNA should have the part.

100V for 45min (can run for longer).
Lane 1: 1kb ladder; lane 2: 100bp ladder;
lane 3-7: FP prefix + RP suffix (5 repeats with increasing annealing temperatures) has 2 bands ~800 bp & 100-200bp (probably non specific bands, will lower # of cycles in future, use higher annealing temp, lower annealing time).
Expected size of inv+hly part is 4.1kb.
lane 8-9: VF + M2 has a thick band 800-900bp.
Expected size is 600+130bp (VF adds ~130bp compared to FP_prefix) .: doesn’t seem to be correct….
lane 10-11: VF + inv F has no bands. Expected is at least 200bp (bcos universal primers).
lane 12: VR + inv F seems to have a small band <100bp. Non specific amplification?
Expected is 1.5+0.1 kb (from VR).
Colony PCR for inv/hly plasmid using Biobricks Prefix and Suffix primers, and Universal primers VF, M2 (Using gradient PCR and different annealing temperature) for 5 samples
Ran gel in same order with 1kb, 100bp followed
