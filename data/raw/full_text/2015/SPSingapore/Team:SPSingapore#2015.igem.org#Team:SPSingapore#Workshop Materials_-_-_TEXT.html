Genetic Engineering Workshop by SPSingapore iGEM 2015
Introduction
The introduction of genetic engineering(GM) and synthetic biology to the layman has long been fraught with issues. Already, as evident from the organic and non-GM food movement, there exists a portion of the population that is distrustful of Genetic Engineering in their food, let alone for any medical treatment. As our project involves the use of a genetically engineered bacterial vector, this issue is of particular importance to our team.
We believe that this distrust stems from a misconception of synthetic biology amongst the general public; Genetic engineering is to many an almost mystical concept. It draws out terrifying images of science gone mad, of biologists tinkering with things far beyond their understanding. However, with the fundamental complexity of many synthetic biology concepts, their lack of understanding is somewhat understandable.
