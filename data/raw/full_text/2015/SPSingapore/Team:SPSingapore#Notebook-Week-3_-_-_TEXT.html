Week 3 (7/6 - 13/6)
▪ June 8
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
Miniprep of gfp plasmids, preparation of samples for sequencing
▪ June 9
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
All gfp plasmids had a correct sequence
Yanting kept glycerol stock for all, and inoculation of 3mL of gfp3 into 100mL LB+amp for midiprep
▪ June 10
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han & Yun Ting ☀
Midiprep of gfp plasmid
PCR of gfp with KpnI-gfp and XhoI-gfp primers
▪ June 11
esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Yun Ting & Duy ☀
Nanodrop of gfp product-> 595.5ng/ul
RE digest of EsaR vector with KpnI/XHoI
Gel electrophoresis at 1000V for 30min
▪ June 12
esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Yun Ting ☀
Gel extraction using Promega binding solution to melt gel, followed by thermo scientific kit
Poor results: EsaR 1.9ng/uL, gfp 3.6ng/ul
Heated EB to 70degC and incubated on column for 30min
Poor results: EsaR: 4.3ng/ul, Gfp: 2.8bg/ul
esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Adrian ☀
Gel extraction optimisation
Hypothesised that the Binding buffer has a problem/DNA does not bind to column
1: 2X promega binding buffer volume
2: Increase incubation time for binding to 5min
Switch binding buffer to that of thermo scientific PCR purification kit
Use sodium acetate if available? TO facilitate stronger binding to column
Results
1: ~10ng/ul
2: ~9ng/ul
not succesful
further optimisation-> warm buffer, incubate for 5min
elute in 30/20ul smaller volumes
▪ June 13
esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Yi Han ☀
1: Thermoscientific miniprep columns with 2XThermoscientific binding buffer 2: Thermoscientific PCR purification kit 2X buffer 3: Promega kit 2X buffer
Protocol failed despite heating EB, increasing incubation time and eluting 2X
yields < 10ng/ul
