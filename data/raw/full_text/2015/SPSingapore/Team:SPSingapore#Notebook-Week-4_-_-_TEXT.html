Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
Transformation of ligated esa-GFP plasmid into DH5\alpha cells
DH5alpha, unlabelled brown vial inside DH5\alpha box at -80
▶ Plates spread at 1140h
▶ LB + chloroamphenicol
4x (100ul)
10x (40ul)
20x (20ul)
LB - 20x (20ul)
Remaining transformed cells (~220ul) are kept at 4C
▶ labeled as placGFP in brown tube
▪ June 17
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
only 4x placGFP plate has colonies (7)
▶ spread one new LB + chlor plate with 200ul of transformed bacteria
▶ picked 6 colonies to grow for miniprep in LB + chl liq media
▶ Conclusion: Protocol works but optimization for increase vol needed
Cloning of synparts in amp vector
▶ comes as 4mg dry DNA
▶ +40ul of DI/RNAse free H20
▶ for transformation, 150ml wed
