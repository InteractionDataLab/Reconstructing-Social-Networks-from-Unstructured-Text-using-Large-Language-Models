Our Beloved Mentors
Leslie Gaptor
Dr. Leslie is trained as a molecular biologist and her dissertation focused on breast development and tumorigenesis. Leslie joined NUS in 2005 and her past research has focused on analyzing botanical products for breast and prostate cancer treatment.
In 2008, Leslie became a full time scientific writer at the Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore, before moving into her current position as a Lecturer in 2010. Leslie teaches 'The Cell' module, which examines the universal mechanics and functions of cells from an integrated science perspective, for the Special Program in Science.
Linda J Kenney
Dr Kenney is a Principal Investigator at the Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore, as well as Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Her laboratory studies two-component systems in bacteria that control gene expression at a single cell and nanometer level. Her current research interests are in signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes.
Stuti Desai
Stuti joined the Kenney group in May 2012, with a strong urge to amalgamate her doctoral training in studying silent genetic systems in enterics to decipher the behavior of bacteria under various environmental challenges. She obtained her doctorate from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, under the guidance of Prof Subramony Mahadevan. She studied Biochemistry for my Master's degree and Chemistry, Physics and Zoology for her Bachelor's degree at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Baroda, India.
