▪ July 5
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han & Clarice ☀
Colonies for EsaGFP grew
Colony PCR for 14 colonies
Unsuccessful-> no bands observed
▪ July 6
esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Clarice ☀
Colony PCR with different colonies (15 colonies)
FP_BB_Prefix and RP_BB_Suffix
Success
▪ July 7
Workshop ☀ Yi Han ☀
Trying out an idea for workshop
Trial for blue/white screen
Streak out pGFPuv and pGEMT on plate with amp added

Ran gel with FNR Pcr and gfp pcr
Size of pcr product was correct but gel picture was not saved
FNR Product was pcr purified
Plasmid extraction for colony 2,3,4 of esaGFP - > 2,3 were sent for sequencing and primers did not bind, chromatogram was messed up.
