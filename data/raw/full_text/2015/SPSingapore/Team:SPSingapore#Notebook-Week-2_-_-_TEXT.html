▪ May 31
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing
☀ Xin Yi ☀
Sent EsaR clone 4 and INv-4 for sequencing.
Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yan Ting ☀
RE with XbaI and PstI
RE - 2ul
Buffer - 5ul
DNA (4x of miniprep=74.5ng/ul) - 13.4ul
H2O - 29.6ul
Incubate at 37degC for 2.5h (1130-1400)
▶ Results: Gel loaded 1kb ladder, uncut, RE digested. 100V for 1h.
Plasmid doesn't have XbaI site - RE digested DNA is a linear 6kb band.
▪ June 2
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Xin Yi ☀
YFP and GFP transformation results - no colonies for YFP
The GFP transformation repeated with 100ng of plasmid was sucessful. 4 colonies of gfp plasmid were inoculated in 3mL LB+amp and grown overnight.
▪ June 3
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Yi Han ☀
Miniprep of gfp plasmids
RE digest with EcoRI and RsaI
▪ June 4
Anaerobic Promoter ☀ Chi Yan ☀
RE digest indicated a very faint smaller band for colonies 2-4, and hence these were likely to be positive clones
▪ June 5
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing
☀ Yan Ting ☀
Inoculated 3mLS of Inv-4 and EsaR-4 plasmid carrying bacteria into 100mL LB+ appropriate Antibiotic
Cell culture-> HEK293 cells revived from freezing down appeared detached.
▪ June 6
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing Anaerobic Promoter
☀ Yi Han ☀
Storage of bacterial glycerol stocks for Inv-4, EsaR4 in 25% glycerol
Yanting: grew HEK293T cells in T25 flask
Gel extract to clean up gfp plasmids which loading dye had accidentally been added to.
