▪ May 25
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing
☀ Yi Han ☀
Received 2 bacterial stab cultures, EsaR/I plasmid from addgene (CHL) and BBa_K299812 from iGEM HQ.
Streaked out on plates with amp.
May 26
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing Anaerobic Promoter
☀ Adrian ☀
Transformed:
      +Kit plate 1 9N Ba_K763002 chl
      +Kit plate 4 13L BBa_E0040 amp
DNa was received in powder form in plates, and resuspended in 10ul ultrapure H2O respectively. Plates were stored in -20/
Invasin + Listerolysin esa Quorum Sensing Anaerobic Promoter
☀ Yi Han ☀
Plates cracked in incubator as they dried from lack of humidity.
Transfer to small incubator with beaker of water for humidity no single colonies for inv plasmid -> streak again.
Wrong antibiotic for EsaR/I plasmid → streak out again
May 28
Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Yi Han ☀
❱❱❱ Inoculate single colony of invasin plasmid carrying bacteria in 3mL LB+amp
❱❱❱ Transformation of 13L repeated with 1ul of DNA.
May 29
Invasin + Listerolysin ☀ Xin Yi ☀
No colonies grew for 13L on all plates → adjust incubator, make new media
Miniprep of inoculated bacteria for invasin plasmid, incubate sample in 37degC for 1h 20min:

esa Quorum Sensing ☀ Xin Yi & Yi Han ☀
❱❱❱ Miniprep of EsaR/I plasmid for 4 colonies
❱❱❱ Restriction digest for EsaR with XbaI/BamHI:
