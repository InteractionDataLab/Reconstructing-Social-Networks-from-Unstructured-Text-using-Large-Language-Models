Genetic Engineering Workshop Video
This page documents the primary materials that were used by our team in conducting our Genetic Engineering Workshop for pedagogical purposes. Apart from a video recording of part of the workshop proceedings, we have also made available the teaching tools and detailed analysis of workshop feedback from the students. We hope that scientific educators may find these useful.
