"For Science"
We are a young and dynamic team of budding scientists looking to push the frontiers of research and advance scientific and human knowledge.
Above all, we strive to do good science.
Team SPSingapore is proud to announce that we have won a Silver medal at the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM), the premiere student competition in Synthetic Biology!
We were delighted to represent the National University of Singapore for the first time at the iGEM with our research project, Controlled Missiles: Targeted treatment of tumors with engineered E. coli . The Jambouree was a truly memorable experience, and we hope to send a new team next year!
Please check here and here for our press releases. Pictures of the team at the iGEM Jambouree are also available .
