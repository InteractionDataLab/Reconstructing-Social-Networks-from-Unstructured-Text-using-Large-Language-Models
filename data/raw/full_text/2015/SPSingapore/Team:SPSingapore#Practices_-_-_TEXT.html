Synthetic biology is an exciting and upcoming field, but not one without risks and controversy. Hence, there is a need to increase awareness and promote dialogue amongst the community.
To accomplish this, our team conducted a one-day hands-on workshop to introduce basic concepts of genetic engineering to fellow university students. We also consulted extensively with two faculty members to glean their insights and views pertaining to the field.
