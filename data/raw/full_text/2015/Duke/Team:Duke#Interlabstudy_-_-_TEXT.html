Interlab Study
This year Duke iGEM took part in the InterLab Study. We linked three promoters to the fluorescent marker I13504 on pSB1C3. Then each construct was Sanger sequence verified and measured with three biological samples on a flow cytometer. The fluorescence information associated with each promoter is characterized in the table below.
