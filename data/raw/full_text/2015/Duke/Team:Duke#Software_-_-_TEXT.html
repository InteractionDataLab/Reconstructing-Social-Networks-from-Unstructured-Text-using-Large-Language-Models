Software
To visualize plasmids, plan restrictions or ligations, and plan biobricks, we used SnapGene, which can be found here .
Modelling was performed with MatLab, a fairly ubiquitous software program which can be found here .
Additionally, Dynetica, a software program developed by one of our advisors, Dr. LingChong You. It can be used to model various biological systems, and is quite useful; it is free to use and can be found here .
