His happy place is the lab, and he finds a strange zen in doing MiniPreps and filling 96-well plates. His greatest pleasure is pipetting off all the supernatant without disturbing the pellet whatsoever. A sophomore intending to pursue biology and computer science, he prefers to spend his free time searching for wildlife on hikes or in a good documentary. He decided to join iGEM to broaden his knowledge of current synthetic biology techniques and DNA manipulation, but mostly because he enjoys toying with entire colonies of creatures which he could wipe out with his thumb.</P><LI>Ben Hoover</LI><P>Ben is the team middle schooler. Often mistaken for a 12 year old, he is fascinated by every object in biology lab that moves or blinks or makes funny noises. Sometimes he even tries to replicate said noises or harmonize with the spinning of the centrifuge. Some say he is a junior in college. He doesn’t believe them. Some say he’s on track for a Biomedical Engineering degree. But tracks can split and change directions and merge. If you’re really unlucky you might hit a break in the tracks and find yourself derailed. Meh. He is more likely to be found lying on the tracks and looking at the stars.</P><LI>Sarah Jacobs</LI><P>Sarah is a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering from Palo Alto, California.

Nick really likes oscillators, such as the cell cycle, metabolic rhythms, circadian clocks, and synthetic oscillators. Folks in his lab use a combination of synthetic biology, time lapse microscopy, microfluidics, comparative genomics, mathematical modelling, and molecular genetics to understand biological oscillation. When he's not in lab, he's at home on five acres in the Duke forest with his family. The summer fireflies are very satisfying to watch.

Dr. Mike Lynch is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Department of Chemistry, and is a Faculty Fellow in The Energy Initiative.  He has research interests in genetically engineering microbes to shut off their growth circuits and turn on new pathways to produce different compounds.  By focusing their energy, he seeks to improve production of biofuels, pharmacological molecules, and industrial chemicals.
