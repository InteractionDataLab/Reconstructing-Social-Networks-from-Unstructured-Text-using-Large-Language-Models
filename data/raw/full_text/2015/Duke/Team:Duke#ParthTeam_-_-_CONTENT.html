        We are a skillful and persistent group of nine Finns. We started as a group of students who didn't really know each other, assuming that we were going to spend our summer studying synthetic biology with strange colleagues. In the end we got a bunch of new friends and (in addition to studying synthetic biology) we just might have spent one of the best summers of our lives.
    </P><P>
        Our group is interdisciplinary and it comes from the University of Helsinki and Aalto University; the two big universities located in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from computer science to food technology. Throughout the project, we basically needed all of the special skills of each member to make our visions come true. The diverse set of skills made it possible to have a broad view on any problem.
    </P><P>
        There were also moments when we noticed that no one in our team fits a specific task perfectly but we always took it as a possibility to learn something new and there was always someone up for a challenge! While everyone mostly got to do things they enjoyed the most and were good at already, all of us learned a lot during this project - about all kinds of things.
    </P><P>
        So, even while the team was divided to different subgroups who would focus on a certain part of the project, everyone got the chance to experience and learn something that they had never done before. Being a part of this team has been an amazing opportunity. It's difficult to imagine life without being in this team: how is it possible that we didn't even know each other a year ago?
    </P><P>
        While we all worked intensely on the project, we wouldn't be here without the amazing support that we received!
    </P><P>

            </P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE><ARTICLE><H2>Team Members</H2><P>
        While it was possible for every member to take part in everything, there were some focus areas for every person in the team.
    </P><UL><LI><B>Leading the Team:</B> Oskari made sure that everything that needed to be done would get done. While he didn't always have to do this alone, the importance of proper leadership isn't questionable! Oskari also founded the team and recruited the members.</LI><LI><B>Business:</B> Pietu, Niklas, Otto and Oskari took part in Summer of Startups and brought the entrepreunial views to the team. Pietu is our main pitcher and Niklas and Otto focused on creating the business plan.</LI><LI><B>Research:</B> The background research, designing our genetically engineered machine and the bioinformatics was mostly done by Oskari, Lassi and Laura.</LI><LI><B>Lab:</B> Minttu and Martina spent the summer in the lab playing with bacteria and BioBricks.</LI><LI><B>Modeling:</B> Niklas and Otto are our <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/0/0e/Aalto_Helsinki_Niklas_Model.jpg">modeling agency</A>. They took care of both the mathematical modeling and the business model. Oskari participated in their work by giving comments and suggestions.</LI><LI><B>Simulation:</B> Otto and Niklas took care of the computing whereas Oskari created the user interface for the python script and web based simulation. Lassi ported the computational parts into JavaScript for the web simulation.</LI><LI><B>Software:</B> Lassi was in charge of the software development, created the Seekers and taught everyone to use GitHub. Most of the team members programmed something, but Lassi was usually the first person who you'd go to when your code didn't work. Pietu programmed and built the LED rig and Laura worked with the web pages.</LI><LI><B>Wiki:</B> Laura designed the looks and the structure of the wiki, Lassi implemented the core of the wiki, Pietu made the wiki upload tool and Oskari scripted a neat way to refer to figures in the research section. All of us contributed to the content.</LI><LI><B>Media:</B> Mikko did a wide range of things to hype us in the media, created and constantly updated our social media sites and wrote a big story for Kemia magazine.</LI><LI><B>Visual Appearance:</B> Laura took care of the visual appearance, often asking opinions from the other team members. This included e.g. our logo, web/wiki page layouts, poster, team banner and illustrations of lambda repressor. Minttu made the gene circuit and lamp pictures and took many photos of the lab.</LI></UL><P>
        As already mentioned, we didn't always follow this categorization. Lassi and Otto, &quot;the competent boys&quot; (Finnish version: <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-_QpciNH6c">&quot;komppipojat&quot;</A>) e.g. made competent cells in the lab a couple of times, Niklas made sure that that the layout of the modeling page on the wiki was perfect, Minttu and Laura held a presentation even though they were the most uncomfortable presenting anything in front of a crowd and Pietu designed the layouts for our business cards and the pitch deck for SoS Demo Day, and also photographed the team! Mikko tried out pitching on our trip to Tallinn!

                I’m a synthetic biology enthusiast with a mathematical background and crazy ideas. I’m definitely an optimist so often I need somebody to keep my feet on the ground. I’m very curious and one of the best entertainment is to find out how everything works. I also love to code but lately, I haven’t had too much time for that. In fall 2014 I started my Master’s studies in Biotechnology at ETH Zürich and I’m majoring in Synthetic Biology.
            </P><P>
                In 2013 I heard about iGEM and I knew immediately that I want to participate in it. I took an initiative to found the first-ever Finnish iGEM team and thus, I ended up being the team captain. This means I’m the jack-of-all-trades trying to peek my nose to everything but I’m not really getting things done. I’ve been writing tons of emails, funding applications and developed new ideas but pretty much all the credit of implementing them goes to the rest of our awesome team.
            </P><P>
                I used to play piano and frisbeegolf, do scouting and go cycling. Since I moved to Switzerland (this odd country with a weird set of languages not familiar to me) I’ve tried to enjoy cycling as much as possible because those other hobbies do not really work out here. After iGEM I’m going to look forward to try something new and get involved in new projects. And I already miss sauna and rye bread!
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row row-eq-height memberrow"><DIV class="col-md-8 text-col-right"><H3>Minttu Salmela<SMALL>Lab Rat</SMALL></H3><H4 class="university-title">Aalto University</H4><P>
                A fourth-year Chemical Engineering student majoring in Bio and Food Technology.
            </P><P>
                I am the second half of our lab team and I have been in charge of the wet lab with Martina. I have spent most of my days in the lab working with Biobricks and our dear bacteria.
                I am also the Travel Manager of our team so I have been responsible for all the things related to the Boston trip.
            </P><P>
                In the beginning of the summer I knew barely anything about gene technology, let alone synthetic biology, so it has been amazing to learn a whole bunch of new things and actually getting to do stuff in the lab on our own.
            </P><P>
                One highlight of my summer was when we got our first sequencing results and we finally had concrete proof that we had actually managed to ligate pieces of DNA together. Before that we just had to have faith in ourselves and hope things were going the right way. Now I know why some people say that science is like a religion!
            </P>
                Music, puppies, travelling, a good cup of tea and sleeping in on a Sunday morning are my favourite things in the world.
            </DIV></DIV><DIV class="row row-eq-height memberrow"><DIV class="col-md-8 text-col-left"><H3>Laura Laakso<SMALL>Designer</SMALL></H3><H4 class="university-title">University of Helsinki</H4><P>
                I’m a fourth-year student majoring in Molecular Biosciences and minoring in Computer Science. I’m also interested in art and design. In our iGEM team my main responsibility has been designing things; both the genetic switch and our own visual appearance.
            </P><P>
                I’d have the required skills to work in the laboratory, too, but I ended up spending most of the summer either researching, drawing or coding. I learned a lot about designing genetic mechanisms and also an enormous amount of CSS tricks. It was amazing to see that it was actually possible to do all the things that interest me for the same project, even though they seem so far apart at first.
            </P><P>
                Sometimes I entirely lose the sense of time and place while focusing on something interesting. I might fixate on a drawing, a game, a problem, or even studying, and completely forget everything else for a while. This is often useful, but sometimes also troublesome.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row row-eq-height memberrow"><DIV class="col-md-8 text-col-right"><H3>Lassi Vapaakallio<SMALL>Cool Title</SMALL></H3><H4 class="university-title">University of Helsinki</H4><P>
                A third-year Computer Science student with 2 years of Biotech background.
            </P><P>
                My main responsibility was programming various software tools to help research and lab work, as well as developing our website and wiki. I also racked up a surprising amount of lab hours considering the last time I worked in the lab was 3 years ago.
            </P><P>
                I also did a bunch of bioinformatics. I found myself playing around with Geneious a lot, making primers, analysing sequencing results and building things virtually before we assembled them in the lab.
            </P><P>
                The coolest thing during the summer was making the BioBrick Seeker and seeing what can be achieved by a group of students in a field that we barely knew anything about.
            </P><P><I>Random fun fact:</I> I’m the 36th best pinball player in Finland.
            </P><P>
                I’m kind of a huge game enthusiast. I love spending time with people playing games, whether it’s card games, board games, pinball, table-top RPGs or any kinds of computer games.
            </P><P>
                I also play all sorts of drums.

                I am a third-year student in the School of Electrical Engineering. I’m majoring in Bionics, i.e. combining engineering with existing biological systems. Measuring electrical signals in the human body is one of my key interests.
            </P><P>
                My contribution to the team was more on the entrepreneurial side as biochemistry is not my field of study. I really enjoyed taking our work to the public via the Summer of Startups program. I worked much on the presentations we held, and did quite a lot of pitching too.
            </P><P>
                Later in the summer I researched and built the LED rig we used to perform our measurements. I really enjoy building things. I enjoy coding too, but ended up programming very little, because we have so many great coders in our team.
            </P><P>
                I did learn a whole lot of gene technology and lab-work on the side too. This was a really awesome project to be part of and I can assure that interdisciplinarity really took us far.
            </P><P><I>Keep it simple.</I> I enjoy photography, building things, programming and entrepreneurship.
            </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row row-eq-height memberrow"><DIV class="col-md-8 text-col-right"><H3>Martina Ikonen<SMALL>BioBrick Master</SMALL></H3><H4 class="university-title">Aalto University</H4><P>
                I’m a Bachelor of Science (technology) in Chemical Engineering. This is my fourth year and I’m starting Master’s studies majoring in Bio and Food Technology at Aalto University.
            </P><P>
                I have spent the summer mostly in the lab and made loads of gel runs, ligations and transformations, that is, the cloning. My special skill is knowing the Biobricks well as I had already had an introduction to them when making my Bachelor’s thesis last spring. So I knew the principles of the assembly techniques although I had never done any gene technology lab work before.
            </P><P>
                During the work with my thesis I regretted I would never know if Biobricks are useful in reality. The stroke of luck came in the form of an announcement to build the first-ever Finnish iGEM team. In theory, Biobricks sounded like a cool way of making genetic engineering easier but now I really got an opportunity to do some hands-on work with Biobricks!
            </P><P>
                In my official hobbies I would include synchronized skating and scouting which both I have been into since I was a kid. In addition, I like knitting, spending time outside in the nature and geocaching. I'm certainly going to find some geocaches in Boston, too!

With my colleague Mr. Itänen, I shared the responsibility of designing and creating both mathematical and business models for our project. I also did programming for our simulation, worked in the lab making electrocompetent cells and participated in the Summer of Startups.
            </P><P>
                Although you can often find me lost in thought, I’m generally quite outgoing and spend most of my time discussing recent topics with my colleagues and sampling fine brews, such as coffees and ales.

            </P><P>
                In this project I’ve been in charge of the communications. My main task has been stirring a bustle in the media; both traditional and social. My job has included updating Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube accounts and writing a blog on our website. I’ve also been contacting Finnish press and written a few stories in relevant magazines.
            </P><P>
                My interests cover a wide area of different fields; from biochemistry and gene technology to communications and influencing. I have also given the team members tips in performance, since I have quite a lot performing experience. Likewise the other members, I have also been a little bit all over the place, sometimes working in laboratory and sometimes attending the Summer of Startups program. I also wrote, directed and produced our teaser video to Demo Day.
            </P><P>
                The summer has been a fantastic experience! Learning about gene circuits and BioBricks has been very interesting, but also taking a sneak peek in communication on the field has been educational.
