Experimental Results
The optical densities of each test are given below.
They were then normalized to the 0 hour data point.
The test for the E Lysis gene showed the cell growth inhibition is statistically significant. However, the protegrin and tachyplesin reading could not be proven to inhibit growth. This may be because these antimicrobial peptides act on the outer membrane. Production on the inside of the cell may not effectively lyse cells. Further experiments are required for more insight. Going forward, we plan on using the E Lysis gene in cell death circuits.
