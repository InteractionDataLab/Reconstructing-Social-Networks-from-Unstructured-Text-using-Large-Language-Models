We have focused extensively on the human practices element of synthetic biology of our project. We have conducted a number of investigations and case studies regarding our project and important issues for the community of synthetic biologists.

				Outreach is important to synthetic biologists because there is no point in conducting research if the results are not trusted and therefore unused. For example, the EU, acting in accordance with the precautionary principle, enacted a moratorium on GMOs entering European markets from 2001 onwards which is still in effect to this day [2]. This reinforces the importance of outreach to the public and the need for a scientifically literature population.  (we will sort references later) 
[2] <I>Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC - Commission Declaration</I></P><P>
				As part of our project we have visited multiple schools throughout the West Midlands and other parts of the country, from Manchester to Coventry. We’ve conducted talks on the methods and ethics of genetic engineering and run lab experiments with lower school students. Furthermore, we have had a selection of interns come in to witness the glory of biolabs and experience pipetting DNA a million times an hour, for themselves.
			</P><P>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</P><B><H5> School Visits </H5></B><P>	
A particular favourite trip of ours was our visit to Hartshill school in Coventry (pictured above) where we gave a
presentation on genetic engineering and its implications in society to a class of year 8 children.
It was clear from their reactions that they had never considered genetic engineering to be a possible career choice, or even a thing that could happen in reality outside of science fiction. However their genuine interest and surprisingly logical questions demonstrated their eagerness to learn. Part of our presentation showed pictures of mice genetically modified to express GFP, 
a protein from jellyfish that makes them glow green. One little boy asked “does that mean if you touch them you’ll be stung?”; naturally it doesn’t, but it’s still interesting that they understood the nature of combining traits among different species

 It also showed how little genetic engineering is understood generally in the populace. Of course many questions about Jurassic park were fielded, although we had to leave them with the disappointing message that any form of dinosaur based park would be tens of years of research away from becoming reality.With the same class, we then ran through a DNA extraction experiment using strawberries. This was the first time many of them had been able to physically observe genetic material. By turning an idea on a page into a reality in their hands we hope we've been able to express how real and exciting this technology and field of science is, potentially converting some of them into future biologists along the way.

			Other than schools we've had an abundance of interns come in to assist us and in the process learn about what it's like to work in a biology lab. Our six interns ranged from finishing their GCSEs to entering their second year of sixth form; some had been interested in biology their whole life, some had taken this internship out of curiosity. 

The reality of labs for some was vastly different than they expected. Many were dismayed at the importance of maths in what we do yet found pipetting fun. Strangely. All had covered the basic biological principles of semi-conservative DNA replication, cell division, and gel electrophoresis, but this was the first time they had cause to use any of this knowledge in a practical situation. Other than conventional lab work we gave the interns impromptu lessons on concepts they would cover until their A2 levels, or even until their first year in university. We hope this experience has helped them decide which they wish to take further on in life, whether they decide to pursue academia in university, or go straight into work.

We asked Sixth-Form students from the schools we visited to design and make posters relating to Synthetic Biology.</I></P><P>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</P><B><H5> Live on Radio </H5></B><P>
Two of our most public events were the radio appearance and day at a science museum in Birmingham. These were a great opportunity to speak to large crowds of people, engaging people with synthetic biology, iGem, and our research.

We had three members of our team attend the radio show; two biologists and a modeler. We were able to introduce the basic principles behind synthetic biology and how iGem set out to make this accessible to all types of undergraduate researchers. We also spoke about what drew us to science in the first place. 
			</P><P>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H5> Birmingham Think Tank </H5><P>
At the ThinkTank museum we had three stations, each with two members of the team. The point of this outreach was for members of the public to directly engage with the world of synthetic biology. People were able to do an experiment to extract DNA from strawberries, look at a number of different bacterial communities, and learn about our research. Many people also filled out a questionnaire about the public perception of synthetic biology. This will help track how people's views change as more research, like work from iGem, comes out.

iGEM Group Meetup: we met up with various British iGEM teams to present our current work and to practice our presentation skills.
