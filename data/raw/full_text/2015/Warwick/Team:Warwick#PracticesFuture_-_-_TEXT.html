Future Uses and Applications
As we are in the foundational advancement track one are of human practices was aimed at focusing on the potential future uses of our project can lead to.
The research into this was conducted by interviewing several professors;
Dr Orkun Soyer
Henry Porter
Andrea
Dr Till Bretschnieder
Dr Simon Leigh
We really appreciated their help and contribution to our project.
In these discussions we looked at how our work may impact their field of expertise and compare our method to others being used. This helps us address any criticisms or concerns surrounding our work.
The range of fields on which we focused included cell to cell signalling, cell communities, bio-printing, and 3D manufacturing.

Manufacturing - 3D Printing
The iGEM Warwick 2015 team carried out copious research into 3D-Printing and its applications to the world of synthetic biology. This paper shows in more depth a conversation we had with an expert on the topic ( Dr Simon Leigh ), and what we realised about the feasibility of using this method to produce our models.
When we visited the Birmingham ThinkTank museum we explained the aspect of the possibility of using our method for manufacturing purposes. On speaking with members of the public we wanted to prompt imaginative ideas into what science should aim to build. This was mainly to spark interest and get people thinking of how things can be built.  Here are some of the ideas people came up with:

Tissue Engineering and Bio-Printing
We have considered how our project ties in with current research within tissue engineering which can be read this paper . Currently several methods such as using 3D printing has been beneficial in trying to construct tissue make up of different cell types. Our project may not achieve the production of full structural organs, but could help design tissue samples which can help investigating disease models.

Cell Signalling
Our project can provide a simple framework for simple experimental design for research questions looking into cell signalling, thisan be found within this paper .

Understanding Cell Communities
Cell communities are vastly complex and we have discussed the drawbacks and potentials of how our work comes into the current research in this field, please read this paper for more information.
