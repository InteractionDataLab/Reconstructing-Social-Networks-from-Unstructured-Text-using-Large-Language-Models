Project Support and Advice
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
William Rostain - Great wall to bounce our ideas off of, knew the ins and outs of making our project feasible and successful.
Dr. Manish Kushwaha - Taught us everything we know about primer design, and checked and double checked our G-blocks
Dr. John Duncan - Helped us research and solidify our project and taught us G-block design. With his combined passions of crashing motorbikes, annoying the French, and making cheese in his garage, John was an ideal Supervisor of the project. His ambitious and helpful nature (like his fantastic beard) knows no limits.(Pictured on the right).

William Rostain - Helped us greatly when it came to transforming, plating, and growing cells as well as providing insight into gel techniques.
Dr. Manish Kushwaha - Great troubleshooter of PCR techniques.
Dr. John Duncan - Holder of the economical method of gel extraction. Expert on DNA-glass binding.
Ian Portman - Expert on fluorescent microscopy and has helped us massively with the visualisation of our cell, protein, and DNA origami.

Meet our team
Dwayne "the Rock-y" Balboa
A stone cold scientist with a heart of gold. His interests include: mountaineering, long walks on the  beach, and skipping. Although he may seem stoic he heats up under pressure and is an   excellent addition to the team.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Liam Carroll
A first year Biomedical scientist with a penchant for puns and an inability to not make them at   the worst possible times; interested in the medical applications of every technology ever. Has   only ever beaten Eggy twice at chess after more than 50 games. Is terrified of Aneesa’s daily   beatings. Official title: Lab monkey.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Matthew Chester
Matthew has recently graduated in Biological Sciences and has research interests in climate   science and epidemiology. Matt will be using his Northern charm to whip the members who are  more into chess than anything else into shape with the ambition to win.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Iain Galpin
A Biochemist between undergrad and a Masters programme, Iain has a tendency to bodge  together things that just should not be created. He is interested in the challenge of research, as   well as the future applications. Official title (in his head at least): ­ Mad Scientist.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Ben Hayward
Ben has recently finished his third year of a four year Maths and Mhysics Masters program. He  is interested in applying his experience in mathematical construction to other areas of science,   as well as pro­social enterprise. Less talkative than Dwayne, but full of banter.

Marylka Griffiths
Marylka is a recent graduate of Biological Science. With an artistic flair Marylka had the   inspiration to transform our project into a synthetic biology bioart project in order to graphically   represent future applications and depict our microscopic findings in accessible and beautiful   ways.

Mark Egheosa Iyen Chesley Ogbomo III
A first year Engineer known underground as a bad boy chess player.  His street cred on campus is as intimidating as the sound of his alias ‘Eggymayo’. His ultimate dream is to become an astronaut (no seriously) and nothing interests him as much as learning new things.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Aneesa Sheikh
Aneesa is a first year Biomedical student. Ever the perfectionist, Aneesa has skills in the lab and endless outreach contacts in the local area. She is also (apparently) the least funny member of the team, although we all know that that’s a lie!

Jake Swain
I am the seventh son of a seventh son and was born on a full moon, the doctors that delivered me said that when I came into this world a new star appeared in the sky brighter than the rest and that I blinded a man who looked upon me for too long. I was unanimously appointed team czar due to my unbelievable intelligence, natural perfection andd AthENTIOn to deTAIL/.
Also a second year engineer.
