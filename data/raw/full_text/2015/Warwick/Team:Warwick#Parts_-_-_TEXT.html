Parts
Our new parts are all versions of the same modular system, a fusion protein formed from a bacterial transmembrane domain and a zinc-finger domain, with linker domains between domains and a FLAG-tag for immunofluorescence staining. Each transmembrane/zinc-finger domain is independently interchangeable with other transmembrane/zinc-finger domains, though not interchangeable between each other (i.e. the transmembrane domain cannot be swapped for a zinc-finger domain and vice versa).
The purpose of this fusion protein is to allow bacteria (specifically Escherichia coli) to bind specific short double stranded DNA sequences at their surface; using immobilised DNA the cell should remain bound in place, or this protein can be used for cell identification (barcoding).

Lpp-OmpA-Zif268
This part is our construct with Lpp-OmpA as the transmembrane domain and the Zif268 1AAY fragment as the zinc-finger domain. The transmembrane domain can be exchanged with another using NdeI and AgeI, and the zinc-finger domain can be exchanged using NheI and ClaI. The entire construct is under the pL_lac promoter, and contains a C-terminal FLAG tag.

Lpp-OmpA-sZF2
This part is our construct with Lpp-OmpA as the transmembrane domain and sZF2 as the zinc-finger domain. The transmembrane domain can be exchanged with another using NdeI and AgeI, and the zinc-finger domain can be exchanged using NheI and ClaI. The entire construct is under the pL_lac promoter, and contains a C-terminal FLAG tag.

Lpp-OmpA-sZF10
This part is our construct with Lpp-OmpA as the transmembrane domain and sZF10 as the zinc-finger domain. The transmembrane domain can be exchanged with another using NdeI and AgeI, and the zinc-finger domain can be exchanged using NheI and ClaI. The entire construct is under the pL_lac promoter, and contains a C-terminal FLAG tag.
