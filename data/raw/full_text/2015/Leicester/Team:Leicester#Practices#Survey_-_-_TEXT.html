Survey
As part of the Human Practices section we wanted to understand what people from all backgrounds and ages understood about synthetic biology. To be able to do this we used questions which will highlight what people know and what they thought as an outside prospective of our project idea.
To achieve this we have created an online survey which can be found at: Survey
Survey Results
From the responses of the survey we have converted them such that the results can be seen visually through bar graphs and pie charts, this has been shown below.
Q1. How much do you know about synthetic biology?
A. Results from the survey had shown that most of the surveyors had little or some information about synthetic biology with 7 people having never heard of it before or knowing nothing.
Q2. What would help you understand about synthetic biology?
A. From the above graph it can be seen that most surveyors found that teaching at schools would help one understand synthetic biology. To develop from what we understood from this we produced a lesson plan for Year 9/10 students, which can be found in the Education section.
Q3. What do you think are the advantage to synthetic biology?
A. A number of advantages were listed including:
Synthesis of biological and industrial compounds
Less damage to environment
Healthcare and energy production
Preventing and treating diseases
Q4. What do you think are the disadvantaged to synthetic biology?
A. A number of disadvantages were listed including:
Lack of control and regulation of what can and cannot be produced from synthetic biology methods
Create pathogenic or invasive species
Exploitation by businesses
Could be dangerous when released in environment
Q5. What are your opinions on the use of synthetic biology (including GMOs (genetically modified organisms))?
A. Majority of surveyors had thought that the idea was a good idea
Q6. What do you think about the use of GMOs to treat human disorders?
A.
Q7.  Would you allow yourself to be treated for a disorder using genetically modified bacteria in your gut?
A. From the above bar graph it can be seen that a majority would allow themselves to be treated by GMOs, however it cna also be seen that some however would not give a definite yes answer but will be dependent on the circumstances
Q8. What do you think the ethical issues surrounding this topic are?
A.
