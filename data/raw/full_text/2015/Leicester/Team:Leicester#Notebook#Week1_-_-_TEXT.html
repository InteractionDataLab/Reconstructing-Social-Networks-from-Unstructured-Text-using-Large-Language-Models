Go fund me page for the Leicester iGEM team was first created as such: Leicester iGEM Go fund me
22nd June 2015
09:00-18:00
Start of Labs
Making of agar plates, including ones with chloramphenicol, ready to used the next day to streak bacteria
23rd June 2015
09:00-18:00
Start of Measurement Study
-Suspension of parts required for each device required in the measurement study. The parts (Promoter and GFP) were then transformed into DH5(alpha) bacteria. This is then placed on agar plates made the day before.
24th June 2015
09:00-18:00
Measurement Study
Bacteria produced from the streaks from the previous day are then restreaked again
25 June 2015
09:00-18:00
Measurement Study
The restreaks are taken and placed into liquid culture

29th June 2015
09:00-18:00
Measurement Study
Mini prep of the liquid cultures were made and then nano drops were done
30th June 2015
1% agarose gels were made to ensure that the products we wanted were present in solution
Week 3
Week 3
Due to our project supervisor being away we decided that we concentrated on ensuring that our wiki was started and planning our actual project!.
Week 4
Week 4
7th July 2015
Human Practises
Have created our synthetic biology survey: Leicester iGEM survey
10th July 2015
Measurement Study
Use of fluorescence imaging to see the green fluorescence produced from each device. Repeats of each device were produced and placed onto a 96 well plate. First set of rows consist of 200ul of each repeat and next set has 10x dilution.Controls were placed on the bottom row of blank, positive and negative control. Measurements done at about 560nm.
Nano drops were then taken of repeats which consisted of the highest amount of fluorescence. Fluorescence measured using Omega FLUOstar
