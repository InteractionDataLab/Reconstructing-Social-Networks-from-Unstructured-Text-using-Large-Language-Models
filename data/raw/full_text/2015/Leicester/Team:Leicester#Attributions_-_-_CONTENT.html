In this way we were all able to understand all elements of our project. We also had designated tasks to do, which allowed us to efficiently finish our work. However there were times where we did not fully understand an idea or a certain protocol such that we got support from members of the Genetics Department at the University. At the same time all our work wouldnt be possible without the sponsorship we had got. </P><P> The University of Leicester iGEM team would like to thank anyone and everyone who has helped us throughout this project. Many people have given their knowledge and most importantly time to help ensure that our project was as successful as possible.</P><P>Firstly we need to thank <B>Dr Richard Badge</B> and <B>Professor Raymond Dalgleish</B> without whom the team wouldnâ€™t exist. Their constant supervision and support has been invaluable.</P><P><B>Professor Julian Ketley</B>, for providing his expert knowledge of bacterial expression. The guidance given was the basis of our project.</P><P><B>Amelia Veselis</B> for the use of the lab and the induction into it. We were lucky enough to have extensive lab space in which we filled with our mess.</P><P><B>Dr Rob Mason</B>, for the use and guidance of his fluorometer. This enabled us to accurately determine the success of our transformation experiments.</P><P><B>Dr Richard Haigh</B>, for aiding us in understanding the colonisation of bacteria in the gut. As this subject is the core of our project, the advice Richard provided added a lot to our project.</P><P><B>Dr Alexandra Woodacre</B>, for aiding in the acquisition of bacteria for our testing. </P><P>Last but most definitely not least, we would like to heartily thank the biology department of the <B>University of Leicester</B>

for their support in fundraising, meeting deadlines and for the use of their equipment and buildings. </P><P>All other work was carried out by the iGEM team members. Everyone on the team over the course of our project has contributed to every aspect of the project with no specific lab roles being designated. </P><B> Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team</B></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-2"><A class="twitter-timeline" data-widget-id="327381807010025474" href="https://twitter.com/iGEMLeicester" width="80" height="300">
