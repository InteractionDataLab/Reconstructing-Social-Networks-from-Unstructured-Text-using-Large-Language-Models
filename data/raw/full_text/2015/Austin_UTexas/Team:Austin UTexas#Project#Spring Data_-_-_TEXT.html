Spring 2015 Data Set
Plasmid Construction and Transformation
Plasmids were constructed with standard BioBrick cloning procedures and enzymes. Composite plasmids were constructed using the following BioBrick combinations:
BBa_K864100+BBa_K314100
BBa_E0020+BBa_K608007
BBa_EE030+BBa_K608006
BBa_E0020+BBa_K608003
BBa_E0030+BBa_K608007
BBa_K592101+BBa_K608006
BBa_K592100+BBa_K608004
BBa_K592101+BBa_K608002
BBa_K864100+BBa_K608006
BBa_E0030+BBa_K314100
BBa_E0020+BBa_K608002
BBa_K864100+BBa_K608002
BBa_E0030+BBa_K314100
BBa_K592101+BBa_K608007

Observations and Discussion
insert mutations in SFYFP
EYFP, CYFP stable
