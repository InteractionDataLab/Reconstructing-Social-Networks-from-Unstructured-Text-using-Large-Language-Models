Throughout the course of this year's work, the UT Austin iGEM team created a number of new devices that were biobrick compatible and thus submitted as biobricks.  The first set of plasmids/biobricks relates to the caffeine portion of our project .  These seven designed devices demethylate various methylxanthines.  Data showing growth dependent on the presence of the methylxanthine can be found on the biobrick page.  Additional data can be found on our project page.  We hope to have a final experiment demonstrating the utility of these seven plasmids completed before attending the Giant Jamboree in Boston, but may not get to this until after the Jamboree.
In addition, we designed numerous plasmids that produce a distinct type of yellow fluorescent protein.  We have submitted three of them to the registry as biobricks.  it is important to note that while BBa_K1627009 appears to be very stable, the other two sequences are less stable, and this was the characteristic that we took advantage of for our project, "Breaking is Bad".
Thank you for your interest in our BioBrick parts!
