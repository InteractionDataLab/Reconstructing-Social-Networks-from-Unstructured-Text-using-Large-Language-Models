Light-induced biosynthesis
A light switch for cells
Optogenetics is a rapidly developing field which modulates cellular dynamics using light. We used the CRY2/CIB1 system to control the activity of a split target protein.
Production of valuable metabolites
Cells may produce valuable compounds which may be toxic in high concentrations. Using optogenetic technology, we'll be able to make large quantities of product without death of the cell until the final step in synthesis.
Outreach: Genetic engineering and Ethics
Besides biologists and industrial chemists, who else should care about this? We engaged members of the community to explain the significance of our work and synthetic biology in general.
