Light induced biosynthesis
A light switch for cells
Optogenetics is a rapidly developing field which allows for tunable cell function through the application of light. This is the principle on which our project is founded.
Production of elusive materials
Often cells will produce valuable materials which are themselves toxic to the cells. Using optogenetic technology, we'll be able to make significant quantities of target material without death to the cell until the final step in synthesis.
Who cares
Besides biologists and industrial chemists who might get excited about this, who else would care about this? We made an active effort to try and engage members of the community to try and explain the significance of our work.
