                                    Bioethics is carved out by ethical issues and decision-making procedures surrounding the use of living organisms. Here, we are interested in the fostering personal ethical development of learners by eliciting honest moral responses informed by analytical and scientific data. 
                                    </P><P>
                                    The point we really need to stress is that there is not necessarily a universally agreeable moral response to any situation –but we can take our moral intuitions and make them as universally agreeable as possible.

Learner is now acquainted with the relationship between DNA, protein, and function as well as introduced to the potential of genetic engineering.

Again we hand out nametags as students walk in. We start by asking them what they believe they learnt about DNA, proteins, and genetic engineering from the day before. We then pick off where we left the previous session in terms of ethics by asking them specific questions of what sort of genetic changes are ethically relevant, and if relevant, one’s own ethical valuation on the changes. The three activities are sourced from the UNESCO guide on teaching ethics. 
                                    <P><B>10-30 minutes: Evaluate moral positions of students -cognitive learning process</B></P><P>Around the room will be three signs with Agree, Disagree, and Unsure. Students are asked to move to each sign based on their intuitions regarding a certain statement.</P><P>One way of motivating the activity might be something like: “Now suppose technology to change the genetic information of living organisms were widely available. What would be some changes that we as a people would find helpful, and what are some changes we would find harmful?”
The examples we will use in this session are: Should we use gene therapy to cure previously incurable diseases? Should we use genetic enhancements to improve our physical, mental, and emotional performance? When our genetic information is widely available, should employers hire people based on their genes?</P><P>Each question will follow a quick discussion where members from each sign will present their reasons for their position. Students are allowed and indeed encouraged to move to different signs according to their degree of belief. The activity should end once it appears students have made up their mind (this includes of course, making up ones’ mind to be uncertain). 
                                    </P><P><B>30-50 minutes: Destabilise moral position from certainty to uncertainty –cognitive process</B></P><P>We give a short presentation on proteins including a basic definition, their function, and various examples and pictures. The key here is not scientific understanding but more an intuition of how proteins work linking back to the pineapple experiment as well as the link game. We specify the importance of the shape of the protein. We explain that the function of proteins can be affected by various factors such as heat or light and give necessary examples. This then sets us up to introduce DNA very vaguely as the blueprint which “constructs” proteins. Now that students are familiar with how proteins influence biological function, they can now acquaint themselves with the idea that changing DNA, changes proteins, which change biological function. </P><P><B>50-70 minutes: Introspection and immersion –experiential process </B></P><P>We present our own iGEM project using Styrofoam models whilst tying in the previous session where students learnt that protein function might change due to radiation. Now that an introduction to optogenetics is given, we present a role play scenario for the class. </P><P>Scenario: The year is 2055. The evil corporation Mons*nto has released airborne viruses containing light-responsive genes –if you are infected, upon shining blue light on you, you will lose your memories. In groups, come up with possible implications of living in this world as your chosen character. Our cast is a student at this high school who has just found out she has the illness, a lawyer defending Monsanto, a scientist working on the virus from Monsanto, a general of the Australian Defence Force, a policeman. </P><P>Students will be given various facts about optogenetics and split up into character groups. Team members should walk around asking reflective questions. It is important to avoid binary declarative statements such as “X is good and Y is bad”. </P><P>Each group will present their character responses at the end of the class.
