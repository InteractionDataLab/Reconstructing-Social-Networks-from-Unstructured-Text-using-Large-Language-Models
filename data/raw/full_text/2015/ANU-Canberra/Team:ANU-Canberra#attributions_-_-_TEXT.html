Project and team management, lab work, outreach and side projects such as bioreactor design and the blue-light source were primarily student driven, with guidance on protocol, lab instruction, frameworks for design of constructs and experiments and general advice and team and project management from the academic advisors.

Everyone in the team thought up, presented and discussed initial project ideas. The traditional cloning experiments were performed by Henry, Janelle and Matthew. Ellen and Conor also assisted with these experiments. The Gibson assembly was performed by Henry and Janelle. The protein purification and analysis was organised by Henry and carried out by Henry, Janelle and Matthew.
Matthew designed, organised and performed the Interlab Measurement study. The lab book was compiled by Henry, Janelle and Matthew. Henry constructed and wrote instructions for the blue-light device.
Public outreach was organised and designed by Janelle and Matthew. Laura designed the outreach poster. Henry made the animation. Ellen, Conor, Henry, Janelle, Victor and Matthew ran the public outreach programs. Conor, Janelle and Victor filmed the outreach video. We thank Alisha Duncan and Natalia Bateman Vargas (ARC Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis) for arranging our involvement in their outreach programs and providing the plan and materials for a number of activities.
High school outreach at the Melba Copland Secondary School was organised and designed by Victor. Henry and Victor the high school outreach sessions. We thank Simon Mulvaney, Amrita and Julie Harrison (ANU Student Equity) for their assistance with the high school outreach program and Melissa Easterby and Matt Colbran (Melba Copland Secondary School) for helping organise our visits.
The wiki was designed and compiled by Richard. Janelle and Matthew assisted with the compilation of the wiki. Richard also designed the team logo. Janelle and Richard took the photos displayed on this wiki and in our presentations.
The following sections of the wiki were researched and written as follows:
Project description: Janelle & Matthew
Experiment description: Henry, Janelle & Matthew
Industrial-Scale NAD Biosynthesis: Conor
Industrial Safety - Biocontainment: Janelle
Public outreach: Janelle
School outreach: Victor
Team administration was managed by Janelle, Victor, Laura and Matthew, with Laura as Secretary and Janelle as Team Leader. Janelle delegated research tasks. Janelle, Victor and Matthew presented the project to sponsors.
Academic Instructors
A/ Prof Spencer Whitney (ANU Research School of Biology) designed and ordered the constructs and traditional cloning experiments, led the cloning experiments and provided protocols, led the preliminary functional testing of the Cre-recombinase system. He also assisted with management of the team and project, assisting with presentations, further research and finding sponsorship.
Dr Colin Jackson (ANU Research School of Chemistry) assisted with management of the team and project.
Hafna Ahmed, Jason Whitfield & William Zhang (Jackson Lab, ANU Research School of Chemistry) designed and assisted with the Gibson assembly, protein purification and protein analysis.
Dr Colin Scott (CSIRO) contributed the idea of NAD biosynthesis based on the CRY2/CIB1 system we presented.
We thank the Whitney and Jackson labs for their time, instruction and resources.
