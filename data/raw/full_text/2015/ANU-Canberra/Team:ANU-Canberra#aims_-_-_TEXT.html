Aims of our Project
There are three main experimental aims of the project:
1.
To show that the CRY2/CIB1 system is functional in E. coli
2.
To apply the CRY2/CIB1 system to Cre-lox recombination using two reporters
3.
To apply the CRY2/CIB1 system to a specific target system, the CRE-lox recombination for NAD biosynthesis in E. Coli.
Further aims of the project are:
4.
To consider real-life application of these systems (including NAD biosynthesis in an industrial setting)
5.
To increase awareness of synthetic biology in the general public through outreach
Lastly an overarching aim of the team this year is:
6.
To establish the iGEM at ANU: explore how to set up, organise and manage the project to assist future teams.
