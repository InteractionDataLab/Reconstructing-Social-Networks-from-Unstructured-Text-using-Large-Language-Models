Project and team management, lab work, outreach and side projects such as bioreactor design and the blue-light source were primarily student driven, with guidance on protocol, lab instruction, frameworks for design of constructs and experiments and general advice and team and project management from the academic advisors.

Everyone in the team thought up, presented and discussed initial project ideas. The traditional cloning experiments were performed by Henry, Janelle and Matthew. Ellen and Conor also assisted with these experiments. The Gibson assembly was performed by Henry and Janelle. The protein purification and analysis was organised by Henry and carried out by Henry, Janelle and Matthew. 
                                    </P><P>
Matthew designed, organised and performed the Interlab Measurement study. The lab book was compiled by Henry, Janelle and Matthew. Henry constructed and wrote instructions for the blue-light device.

                                    Public outreach was organised and designed by Janelle and Matthew. Laura designed the outreach poster. Henry made the animation. Ellen, Conor, Henry, Janelle, Victor and Matthew ran the public outreach programs. Conor, Janelle and Victor filmed the outreach video. We thank Alisha Duncan and Natalia Bateman Vargas (ARC Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis) for arranging our involvement in their outreach programs and providing the plan and materials for a number of activities.

                                    High school outreach at the Melba Copland Secondary School was organised and designed by Victor. Henry and Victor the high school outreach sessions. We thank Simon Mulvaney, Amrita and Julie Harrison (ANU Student Equity) for their assistance with the high school outreach program and Melissa Easterby and Matt Colbran (Melba Copland Secondary School) for helping organise our visits.
