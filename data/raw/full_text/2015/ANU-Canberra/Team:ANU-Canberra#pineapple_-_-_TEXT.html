Goals - Pineapple Proteins
1.
Learner is introduced to DNA from a functional perspective and appreciates its role in producing proteins.
2.
Learner is introduced to the idea of changing biological function by manipulating protein expression.
Start point
Learner has little or no exposure to proteins, DNA, or genetics.
End point
Learner is now acquainted with the relationship between DNA, protein, and function as well as introduced to the potential of genetic engineering.
1.
Learner appreciates the importance of proteins for the functioning of the cell
- Creating intuitions by linking effects or functions of proteins to the molecule
- Move past intuitions into the structure of proteins as chains of amino acids
2.
Learner appreciates the role of DNA in coding for amino acids.
- Qualitatively (and vaguely) study the process by which DNA is turned into amino acids
3.
Learner links manipulation of DNA to “real world” effects.
Runsheet
0-10 minutes: Students are supplied with nametags and the session begins with a quick ice breaker game. We decided on the Link game due to similarities with protein folding. In this game, in groups, students close their eyes and link up their hands with other members in their group. The goal is to, without letting go of each other’s hands, unravel the knot completely.
10-15 minutes A quick introduction of our team members is followed by an explanation of the practical. We decided to demonstrate the role of enzymes within pineapples in breaking up gelatine at different temperatures. Due to the length of time needed for jelly to set, the practical was set up ahead of time. One sample of pineapple juice will be heated and the other set at room temperature so that the heated sample would contain only denatured proteins thus jelly would be able to form. This will be used to motivate how radiation might change protein function a la optogenetics.
15-30 minutes We give a short presentation on proteins including a basic definition, their function, and various examples and pictures. The key here is not scientific understanding but more an intuition of how proteins work linking back to the pineapple experiment as well as the link game. We specify the importance of the shape of the protein. We explain that the function of proteins can be affected by various factors such as heat or light and give necessary examples. This then sets us up to introduce DNA very vaguely as the blueprint which “constructs” proteins. Now that students are familiar with how proteins influence biological function, they can now acquaint themselves with the idea that changing DNA, changes proteins, which change biological function.
45-55 minutes: We introduce the idea of genetic engineering on the above basis. Students are asked to brainstorm examples of genetic engineering they are familiar with. We use reflective questions to guide students into thinking about the social “good” derivable from certain genetically modified organisms and how this links with their ethical intuitions.  We then conclude the session by checking on the jelly to make sure it has set. If not, we will prepare spares. We will then handout some prepared jelly for students to take with them into recess.
