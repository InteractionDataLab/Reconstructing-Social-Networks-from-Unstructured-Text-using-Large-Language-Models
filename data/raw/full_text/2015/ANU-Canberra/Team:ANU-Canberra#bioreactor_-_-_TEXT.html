Industrial scale NAD synthesis
While light induction is a potentially viable means for the production of important molecules or constructs, such a process is only practical if the production can be achieved on an industrial scale. Similar reasoning is applied to biological production processes in general, which need to demonstrate economically sustainable, environmentally friendly, large-scale production capabilities in order to replace any existing non-biological processes. In order for light-inducible, biological production of NAD to be successful, we need to identify an appropriate system that optimises NAD synthesis on a suitably large scale at minimal cost.
Analogous to our present investigation is the development of biological production process for the production of H2. Achieved using any of four classes of bacteria or algae, this process has demonstrated significant advantages over other, non-biological processes, namely their ability to be conducted under ambient conditions without the use of harmful catalysts (Adessi and De Philippis 2014). However, while biological H2 production processes have been demonstrated as sustainable, renewable, and energy-efficient processes, achieving production on scales similar to non-biological processes remains a significant challenge.
