Our Project
Background
In the International Year of Light, we were inspired to investigate potential uses of light in synthetic biology (optogenetics). We describe a strategy for the use of the photosensitive protein CRY2 to increase yield in the biosynthesis of toxic metabolites.

Aims
We are taking part in the Foundational Advance track, exploring the principles and application of light-induction as an alternative to traditional chemical induction - through experimental work, literature reviews and outreach programs.

Biosafety
We review an innovate strategy for biocontainment, using genetically recoded organisms that require synthetic amino acids to grow and survive.

Photobioreactor
Addressing the industrial aspect of our, we investigated options for potential bioreactors for bulk synthesis of our target material - NAD.
