Our Lab Book
Blue light source
We have devised a simple method to create your own light source from cheap, readily accessible materials, that can be customised for light intensity and pulse frequency - with minimal prior knowledge of electric circuits or experience with building them.

Cre-recombinase functionality assay
We tested the functionality of the light-activated CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase system using a reporter loxP construct.

FRET Tests
As a proof of principle for the expressability and association of the CRY2-CIB1 optogenetic system, we sought to conduct a fluorescence assay based upon the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) phenomenon.

Solubility Tests
Even a successfully expressed protein may not function properly - solubility of our product was one indicator of how successful our light-inducible system would be.
