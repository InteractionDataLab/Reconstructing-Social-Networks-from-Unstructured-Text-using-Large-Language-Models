Introduction of iGEM in a radio program
  In February 2015, we had a chance to appear in the radio program "the future of Gifu," because we were asked for appearing on it by the person involved. The program often introduce people and group which try to revitalize Gifu.
  We introduced iGEM and synthesis biology and told our feelings when we took part in iGEM giant jamboree 2014. We told the listeners that young people should try something because students who study in rural university can compete with students around the world in competitions like iGEM.
Interacting with biology club’s students of Gizan high school
  We held a social gathering, because a member of iGEM Gifu comes from Gizan high school and its biology club. In this, we introduced study contents each other and talked about it. We heard that students of Gizan studied about melanian snails and protected its regional group. They knew that a city in Gifu released melanian snails to increase  population of firefly. When they examined its genetic information, they knew that there were difference between native and non-native species. They feared that genetic specificity of melanian snails was lost, so they suggested to the city to stop releasing them. But the city didn’t accept this suggestion. By getting cooperation with a professor of a university finally, students could stop releasing melanian snails. So we thought that it was difficult to be accepted their suggestions from a group that has low social recognition like high school’s biology clubs.
  We also introduced our activity. High school students asked a lot of questions about our study and iGEM. We think that we could spread actions of iGEM to high school students who have interests in biology by this social gathering.
Introduction of iGEM to super global high school students
  Super global high school is designated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and these school does development of human resources that can play an active part globally. When its students came to the Gifu university, we introduced iGEM and our activity as a part of the visit program. After that, we talked with high school students about studies of a university and told importance of working on things with an aim.
