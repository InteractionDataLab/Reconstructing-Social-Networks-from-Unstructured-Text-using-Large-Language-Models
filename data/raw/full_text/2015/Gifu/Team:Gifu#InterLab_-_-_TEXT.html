Method of Measurement
  We constructed 5 plasmids [positive control, negative control, generator 1~3] by using BioBricks and then transformed to E. coli K-12 JM109. We checked them by colony direct PCR and plasmids sequence. We cultivated correct bacterias by shaking until OD660:0.5. Cultivated mediums were transferred to 96-well plate by 100mL. We read the absorbance.
  Setting of plate reader is following:
Result
Definition
  We expressed absorbance as relative value for positive control.
This expression is following:
  Sample : Absorbance in sample
  NCav : Average of absorbance in negative control
  PCav : Average of absorbance in positive control
Value
Relative absorbance values for positive control are shown below.
FIG1 Relative absorbance values
20K : generator 1 (J23101 + I13504)
22A : generator 2 (J23106 + I13504)
22K : generator 3 (J23117 + I13504)
Discussion
  The value of device1 is much higher than that of device2 and 3. This is why each device is different from promoter sequence, especially -10 and -35 region.
Promoter sequence in device1 resembles consensus sequence. On the other hand, device2 and 3 is not similar than device1. This is how each GFP expression is different.
