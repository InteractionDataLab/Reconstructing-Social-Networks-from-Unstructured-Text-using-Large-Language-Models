Final Safety Form
What is your chassis organism?
E. coli K-12 JM109
Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
No.
How will your project work?
We aim to create useful long chain protein.
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage?
What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
T4 phage may do harm to E.coli. So, we used T4 phage in other room.
How would your project be used in the real world?
Our project is foundational / we do not have a specific real-world application in mind
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use?
What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
A toxic protein can be produced using parts we are going to make. Any materials in our lab should not be transferred without a permission from our instructor.
Any further comments about your project:
No.
Comments about this form: Is it easy or difficult to use? Are the questions confusing?
No.
Discussion with our teachers
We sometimes discussed our safety with our teachers. I show a state of the discussion in the following video.
