   Based on this study, we have 4 ideas to utilize this technique synthesizing a long chain protein by using a circular mRNA.
   To the first, we think that as there are some rare codons in circular mRNA, efficiency of the translation declines and it is difficult to make a long chain protein. Therefore, we plan to make it easy to synthesize a long chain protein by optimizing the circular mRNA. To put it another way, we design the sequence that doesn’t have rare codon.

   To the second, we couldn’t keep the function of the long chain proteins in this year. Therefore, we plan to insert the sequence that will be an active site for protease. Then, long chain proteins are fragmented by proteases after they are synthesized, and they can keep the function. According to the study of last year, efficiency of translating a protein from a circular mRNA is better than a protein from a liner one. Thus, we will be able to synthesize functional proteins efficiently by fragmenting long chain proteins after they will be synthesized.
   To the third, we can’t use long chain protein industry even if it can make it functional, because a protein synthesized in E. coli can’t be transported outside its body. Therefore, we plan to make this protein express in bacillus subtilis which have a function of secreting proteins outside a cell. In other word, there are a chance a long chain protein is transported outside a cell, and we use it efficiently.
   To the fourth, to use the technique of mass production of protein, we plan to synthesize efficient proteins by inserting a gene about hagfish’s slime and expressing in E. coli.    For example, spider thread and the fiber included in a hag fish’s slime are strong and light. Therefore, if we can synthesize a large quantity of these fibers, we can use these instead of nylon synthesized from oil, and it is also helpful for environmental protection.
UCC university studied Hagfish in 2014.
