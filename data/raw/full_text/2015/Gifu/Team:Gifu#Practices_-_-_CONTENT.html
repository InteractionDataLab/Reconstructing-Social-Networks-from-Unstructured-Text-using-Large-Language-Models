The program often introduce people and group which try to revitalize Gifu.</P><P>  We introduced iGEM and synthesis biology and told our feelings when we took part in iGEM giant jamboree 2014.
We told the listeners that young people should try something because students who study in rural university can compete with students around the world in competitions like iGEM.

In this, we introduced study contents each other and talked about it. We heard that students of Gizan studied about melanian snails and protected its regional group. They knew that a city in Gifu released melanian snails to increase  population of firefly. When they examined its genetic information, they knew that there were difference between native and non-native species. They feared that genetic specificity of melanian snails was lost, so they suggested to the city to stop releasing them. But the city didn’t accept this suggestion. By getting cooperation with a professor of a university finally, students could stop releasing melanian snails. So we thought that it was difficult to be accepted their suggestions from a group that has low social recognition like high school’s biology clubs.
</P><P>  We also introduced our activity. High school students asked a lot of questions about our study and iGEM. We think that we could spread actions of iGEM to high school students who have interests in biology by this social gathering.

When its students came to the Gifu university, we introduced iGEM and our activity as a part of the visit program. After that, we talked with high school students about studies of a university and told importance of working on things with an aim.</P></FONT></FONT></UL></BLOCKQUOTE><DIV class="box1">  MENU<OL id="index"><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Gifu/InterLab" style="text-decoration:none;" style="text-decoration:none;">InterLab Study   </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Gifu/Safety" style="text-decoration:none;"> SAFETY </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Gifu/human-practice" style="text-decoration:none;">Policy &amp; Practice  </A></LI></OL></DIV></DIV></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
