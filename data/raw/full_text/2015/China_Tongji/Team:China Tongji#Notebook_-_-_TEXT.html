August 10
1, Test of pmyo2-chR2-YFP, pmyo3-chR2-YFP and Pcos13 overlap with Pcos2 C.elegans.
August 13
1, Intial test of Pmyo-3-chETAC.elegan.
August 14
1, Intial test of Pmyo-3-ic1c2 C.elegan.
1.3.1.3 Week3 -- August 15~21
August 15
1, Try to take some small video of thePmyo-3-chETA and Pmyo-3-ic1c2 C.elegans.
2, Test of pmyo2-chR2-YFP, pmyo3-chR2-YFP, Pcos13 overlap with Pcos2, Pmyo-3-chETA and Pmyo-3-ic1c2.
August 16
1, Intial test of Pmyo-2-ic1c2 andPmyo-2-chETA.
August 17
1, Try to take some small video of thePmyo-2-chETA and Pmyo-2-ic1c2 C.elegans.
2, Test of pmyo2-chR2-YFP, pmyo3-chR2-YFP, Pcos13 overlap with Pcos2, Pmyo-3-chETA Pmyo-3-ic1c2, Pmyo-2-ic1c2 and Pmyo-2-chETA.
August 19
1, Intial test of pttx3-chR2.
2, Try to take some small video of thepttx3-chR2 C.elegans.
August 20
1, Lab meeting about how to take our video in a standard way.We decided to take 40sec each one: 10s for white light, 10s for 470nm light, 10 for white light and 10s for another wavelength light.In this way, we could use some video software to analyze the test result.
August 21
1, Intial test of ptwk16-blink.
2, Test of pmyo2-chR2-YFP, pmyo3-chR2-YFP, Pmyo-3-chETA Pmyo-3-ic1c2, Pmyo-2-ic1c2, Pmyo-2-chETA pttx3-chR2 and ptwk16-blink.
3, Take video of these genetypeC.elegans.
1.3.1.4 Week 4~5 -- August 23~30
August 23,25,27,28,30
