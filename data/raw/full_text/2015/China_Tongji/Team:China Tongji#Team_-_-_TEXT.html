Prior to joining Tongji University, Li completed her post-doctoral training at the University of Michigan, where she was awarded the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship.
The Li lab combines the genetic model organism C.elegans and mammalian system to study the mechanisms of mechanosensation and pain, and uses a multidisciplinary approach of molecular genetics, functional imaging, electrophysiology, optogenetics and behavioral analysis.
3.3 Meng Hao
Hey guys, this is Heidi saying hi from Shanghai. It's really a huge honor and pleasure for me to join the iGEM this year. Currently I work as an international program coordinator of School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University and I will be the guiding teacher of the 2015 iGEM representative team of Tongji University. Though it is the first time for our team to participate in a global science competition, I have strong confidence in all of them that they would make a great difference here on their debut, with their extraordinary courage and dedication. While what really matters to us is nothing but the precious experience where we can see the world and gain growth. Can't wait to meet you all in Boston! Cheers!
