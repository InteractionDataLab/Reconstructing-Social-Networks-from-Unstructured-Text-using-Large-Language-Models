1. Human Practice
This year, our team mainly focus on communicating with other iGEM teams and raising public awareness towards synthetic biology. Through our practice, we have learned more from each other and built sincere friendship among our team and other teams. Moreover, we promoted the public’s understanding of iGEM and our project.
1.1 Three Teams Communication Meeting 1 -- 2015.4.19
On April 19th, we went to Shanghai Jiaotong University to have a communication meeting .Three teams including SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, NJAU_China and Tongji have attended. In this meeting, we first introduced our project respectively. Then we raised some question and gave some advice on other teams projects. We not only considered these suggestions and perfected our projects but made friends with each other as well.

2. Collaboration
2.1 Collaboration with SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
-- Help them start their project
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
2.1.1 Offer them special bacteria
The SJTU-BioX-Shanghai wants to use the bacterial luciferase in the Vibrio fischeri, and Professor Zhifen Lin in College of Environmental Science and Engineering in Tongji University has done a lot of research on Vibrio fischeri .So we help them to communicate with Professor Lin to give the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai some Vibrio fischerifor their project. And we also learn the using method including the culturing method, the molecular cloning method, then we teach the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai how to work with the strain and extract the bacterial luciferase.
2.1.2 Give some advises for their project
Our project is focus on Optogenetics and channelrhodopsins. At the meantime, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai starts their project on halorhodopsin. Since our projects are all basing on the transmembrane rhodopsin, so we communicate a lot about our projects. The transmembrane rhodopsin needs the retinaldehyde(ATR) as its cofactor. However, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai didn’t know how to make the solution of ATR and prepare it for the culture medium of their algae. So we taught them the relevant experimental method and the mixture system.
2.2 Collaboration with SJTU-Software
-- Help them test and improve their software
SJTU-Software
2.2.1 How we collaborate with each other
SJTU-Software built up a multi-level biobrick evaluation and visualization system。Many existing biobricks are not well documented, which make it challenging to use them. They present a web-based tool BASE (Biobrick Auxiliary Selection Explorer) to search, evaluate and visualize biobricks at part, devise and system levels. Biobrick parts are scored according to their current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation and etc. At device level, features, such as the order of parts and the co-existence frequency of two parts in a device, are added into the scoring system. At each level, the biobricks can be searched, evaluated and ranked according to their scores.
We provide them with our parts using in this year’s project including not only the parts we submit ( BBa_K1634002,  BBa_K1634003,  BBa_K1634004,  BBa_K1634007,  BBa_K1634008 ) but also some parts which we constructed and used in our experiments such as ppD95.75_Pmyo3-chETA-EYFP. Then they use their software to score our parts. Finally, we compared the parts' characterization in our wet experiment with their output, and offered them some feedbacks to help them improve their scoring system.
The analysis result they give us:
“This year, TJU used the optogenetics technology to control the simple movement of nematodes. In the pathognosticmotoneuron and muscles of nematodes,the opsin will be expressed, which is a type of photosensitive channel protein that will be activated at a specific wavelength of light. Then it will stimulate some neurons and ultimately achieve the purpose of nematode movement control.
However, during the evaluation, we found that some of their biobricks are so new that we nearly couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before.
Beyond that, we also found the regulator BBa_K1634003 is almost 80% similar to BBa_K309026 which is made by a team from Canada. This result might be used to compare the function of their biobricks with the other team; and explored more useful information from the alike one. ”
2.2.2 Feedback
Through this cooperation, we help them find advantages and disadvantages of their software.
Advantage:
They have focused their software on scoring the parts but ignored there is another strong function of their software, which is helping users to search for a similar or relative parts more efficiently, thus helps a lot for comparing and improving their parts. SJTU-Software starts pay more attention on this function and improve it.
Disadvantage:
During the evaluation, they found that our biobricks are so new that they couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before. Then they couldn’t score our parts. Since most of the parts submitted by iGEM teams are new, we suggest them expanding their data source to cover more parts which can make it a more functional scoring system.
3. Questionare
3.1 Introduction
In order to know people' attitudes to iGEM ,Synthetic biology and Biology safety, we made this survey. From the result we have received, we get many useful information.
There are altogether 317 person filled in our questionnaire. Most of them(95.9%) come from all over China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, etc. Some of them(4.1%) come from other countries such as Congo-Brazzaville, Australia and so on.

This question is a multiple-choice question. Most people just hear about Synthetic biology or even don’t know it .However, most people hold a positive attitude to Synthetic biology and support it. So we can do more propagandas to help the people who hold the opposite attitude to Synthetic biology learn more about it.
3.2.5 For Synthetic biology, safety and science, which is the most important?
5. For Synthetic biology, safety and science, which is the most important?

Most people think Synthetic biology is of great significance. We can create many interesting parts which others never build before. We hope our research could be applied in medical or producing fields.
3.3 Analyses
Chart 3-1: Relationship of the major and the knowledge about iGEM
From this chart, we can see that people who major in Biology, Science and Engineering know iGEM better.
Chart 3-2: the opinions people hold about synthetic biology of different ages
Through this chart, we find that the youth always hold more possitive opinions to Synthetic biology comparing to the elders.
3.4 Conclusion
From these results, we come to a conclusion that the popularity of iGEM has been larger day by day. But it’s still necessary for us to introduce iGEM and Synthetic biology to the public who know nothing about it, and that is what we are doing now.
What make us excited is that almost everyone have a strong awareness of Biology safety, thus we will pay more attention to safety in our future experiments.
What is particularly worth mentioning is most of them hold positive attitudes to Synthetic biology, which encourages us a lot.
