At the meantime, the SJTU-BioX-Shanghai starts their project on halorhodopsin. Since our projects are all basing on the transmembrane rhodopsin, so we communicate a lot about our projects. The transmembrane rhodopsin needs the retinaldehyde(ATR) as its cofactor. However, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai didn’t know how to make the solution of ATR and prepare it for the culture medium of their algae.

They present a web-based tool BASE (Biobrick Auxiliary Selection Explorer) to search, evaluate and visualize biobricks at part, devise and system levels. Biobrick parts are scored according to their current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation and etc. At device level, features, such as the order of parts and the co-existence frequency of two parts in a device, are added into the scoring system. At each level, the biobricks can be searched, evaluated and ranked according to their scores. </P><P class="contentP">We provide them with our parts using in this year’s project including not only the parts we submit ( BBa_K1634002,  BBa_K1634003,  BBa_K1634004,  BBa_K1634007,  BBa_K1634008 ) but also some parts which we constructed and used in our experiments such as ppD95.75_Pmyo3-chETA-EYFP. Then they use their software to score our parts. Finally, we compared the parts' characterization in our wet experiment with their output, and offered them some feedbacks to help them improve their scoring system.</P><H4>The analysis result they give us:</H4><P class="otherTeamWords">“This year, TJU used the optogenetics technology to control the simple movement of nematodes. In the pathognosticmotoneuron and muscles of nematodes,the opsin will be expressed, which is a type of photosensitive channel protein that will be activated at a specific wavelength of light. Then it will stimulate some neurons and ultimately achieve the purpose of nematode movement control.</P><P class="otherTeamWords">However, during the evaluation, we found that some of their biobricks are so new that we nearly couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before.</P><P class="otherTeamWords">Beyond that, we also found the regulator BBa_K1634003 is almost 80% similar to BBa_K309026 which is made by a team from Canada. This result might be used to compare the function of their biobricks with the other team; and explored more useful information from the alike one. ”</P><H3>2.2.2 Feedback</H3><P class="contentP">Through this cooperation, we help them find advantages and disadvantages of their software. </P><H4>Advantage:</H4><P class="contentP">They have focused their software on scoring the parts but ignored there is another strong function of their software, which is helping users to search for a similar or relative parts more efficiently, thus helps a lot for comparing and improving their parts. SJTU-Software starts pay more attention on this function and improve it.</P><H4>Disadvantage:</H4><P class="contentP">During the evaluation, they found that our biobricks are so new that they couldn't find them in our database which covered the data in the iGEM official website. The result showed that those biobricks were never synthesized before. Then they couldn’t score our parts. Since most of the parts submitted by iGEM teams are new, we suggest them expanding their data source to cover more parts which can make it a more functional scoring system. </P><P class="titleOne" id="Questionare">3.
