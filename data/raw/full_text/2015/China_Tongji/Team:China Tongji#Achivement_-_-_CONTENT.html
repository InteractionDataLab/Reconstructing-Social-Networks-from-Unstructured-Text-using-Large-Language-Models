Modeling</P><P class="titleTwo" id="third1">3.1 Real-time tracing and mathematical analysis</P><P class="contentP">We can analyze the reaction of the worms by watching the video we make when we test them. But the video is visual and dynamic. If we can get the track of those worms, it could benefit us a lot. Comparing to video results, the track is static and directly. So we decide to analyze the track of the worms. </P><P class="contentP">We draw up the trace of all these strains of worms by using real-time tracking technology. In our project, we keep tracking the head of the worm to draw up the trace. Due to the video we made, we generate a point at the location of the worm head at every 100ms. As a result, we can get a picture which stands for the trace of our worms.</P><P class="contentP">But the information is still not enough for us, so we try to give a coordinate system to each trace, which means that we can get the coordinate of each point. So we define the first point as the original point, and the first two points on the X axis or Y axis. Then we get the trace with coordinate system.</P><P class="contentP">Having the track of worms doesn’t mean we can get useful information from them. Only standardize the video can we make comparison to the different type of worms. To evaluate the reaction of these gene modified worms, we find some different aspects to observe  their trace, speed and analyse the turning angle when the C.elegans makes a turn. So standardizing the video is very important for us to analyze the speed and the trace.</P><P class="contentP">So we use 5-10-10 routine to make the video of the worms, so that it can benefit our analyzation later.The 5-10-10 routine means that the first 5 seconds leave the worm in white light, after that give it a 10 second of LED light, and at last leave it in white light for about 10 seconds or more. The 5-10-10 routine is better for us to analyze the speed of those worms. And the first 5 seconds' white light is use to observe the normal behavior of the worms which can make comparison to the following period. The third period is use to observe how long the worm can return to normal condition.</P><H3>Here are the tracks we build with coordinate system.</H3><CENTER><P class="modelingImgName">Figure 3-1: The trace of pmyo2-ChR2-YFP (with coordinate)</P><P class="modelingImgName">[ <SPAN style="color:#F00"><B>Red points</B></SPAN> represents the track under white light. ]</P><P class="modelingImgName">[ <SPAN style="color:#00F"><B>Blue points</B></SPAN> represents the track under blue light (470nm) ]</P></CENTER><P class="contentP">We test this kind of worms by using 5W LED blue light (470nm) with 1000mA LED driver.

Their reactions are always step back. Secondly if we focus on the movement of their heads, we can find the turning angles change a lot during this time. It means the blue light can stimulate the muscle of their heads and as a result the worm will change the direction.

By using these data, we find the curve which fit to the tracks. If the quantity of the samples is big enough, we can use these data to find the features hidden behand these images. We can even predict the movement of the C.elegens.</P><P class="titleTwo" id="third2">3.2 The relationship between light intensity and response index</P><P class="contentP">By using DC2100 we can achieve the goal that we could control the current of LED accurately. For our LEDs, there is a direct proportion relationship between light intensity and the current which move across it. To test which value is the best to stimulate the C.elegens, we design this part to help us. According to the limitation of DC2100, the largest current we can use is 1000mA. So we pick some worms of all strains which have obvious reactions as our experimental material (using 1000mA to test the reactions before). Using the worm which have reactions before is very important for this part. 0mA is needn’t to be tested, so we choose to start from 50mA. We pick up 10 worms from every strains to test whether it has response or not. After 50Ma has been tested, we test the 100mA and then 150mA and so on. Until we finish the test of 1000ma, we calculate the ratio of having reactions.
