Contribution
Our team improved the function and characterization of previously existing BioBrick Parts (created by one of our univerisity teams SCUT in 2014 of iGEM), and entered this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see the Registry Contribution below, and you can click on the name of parts to see more detailed information. (These parts do not come from our team's 2015 range of part numbers)
This experiment is designed to demonstrate the improvement of element's function. We use the fluorescence quantitative PCR method, add a pair of primers and a special fluorescent probe which is oligonucleotides with report fluorescent groups and fluorescence quenching groups at the ends. When the probe is complete, the fluorescence signal emitted by report fluorescent groups are absorbed by fluorescence quenching groups. When the PCR begin, the probe combine with a single chain of DNA. Then in the amplification, Taq enzyme, a the 5'-3'end excision enzyme degrade the probe, make the report fluorescence groups and the fluorescence quenching groups separate. Then the fluorescence monitoring system can detect the fluorescence signal. One DNA chain, one fluorescent molecular. We can identify the yield of PCR by detecting the fluorescence signal. We also draw a standard curve to quantify the experimental result.
