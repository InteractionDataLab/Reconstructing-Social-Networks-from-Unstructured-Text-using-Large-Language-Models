There are 15 student members, 5 instructors and 2 advisors in our team SCUT Champion Park. At first, we didn't think that our team would be so large, but with more and more talents join us, we are almost able to set up a company.
Our operating model is designed to deliver faster decisions. Each of us has clear duties and tasks. The 15 student members are divided into three big groups, and they are experimental group, social practice group, visual design group.
There are 6 members in the experimental group. Tao Deng is the group leader. The experimental group still divide into two smaller groups, core experimental group and biobrick group based on their experiments.
Social practice group has 3 students. Each member is a project manager for two to four projects. As the manager of these projects, they collect data, make plans and are primarily responsible for their own projects.
There are 5 members in the visual design group. Three are responsible for art and two are responsible for program design. Yuyu Tang is the leader of the visual design group. When other groups have accomplished some work, they summarize it and send it to Yuyu Tang. Then the designers will design these materials and the programmers will make them into web pages.
Jin Jia is the leader of SCUT Champion Park. He participates in all the parts of the total work and ensure them work well.
