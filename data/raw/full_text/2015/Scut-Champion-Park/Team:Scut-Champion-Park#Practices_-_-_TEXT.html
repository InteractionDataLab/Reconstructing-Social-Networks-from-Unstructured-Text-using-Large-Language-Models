In Human Practice, our team did a policy research, organized three meetings, did research on the present situation of antibiotic residues and tried to find its solutions and propagandized our project by Wechat and Super Brochure. Moreover, we mentored Shenzhen_SFLS team, visited Scient and interviewed experts.
After the policy research which we found the phenomenon that antibiotic residue in food of animal origin threatens people's health, then we organized the meetings with other teams to improve ourselves. We've done research on the present situation of antibiotic residues to make sure whether it's serious about antibiotic residues in Guangzhou, while improve people's recognition of this phenomenon by Wechat and Super Brochure. Then we mentored Shenzhen_SFLS team to help them do better, visited Scient to consummate our project in practical application and interviewed experts to look for some advises to control Antibiotic residues.
