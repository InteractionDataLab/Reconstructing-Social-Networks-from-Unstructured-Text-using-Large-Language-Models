I think IGEM is a very interesting game, and I am also an active person, so I found a lot of like-minded friends to participate in the competition together. And I plan to apply for a PHD in the United States this fall for further study. I think this Boston trip will give me a real understanding of American College.

IGEM is a competition of synthetic biology. The team needs to have the ability to control the input and output signal with technology of synthetic biology. In my mind, it is the best way to combine study with applying. How exciting it is to build the system for achieving the goal. In our team, I am a main experimenter, and I want to grow up with my team. I like challenge, and I think it will make life colorful. I believe in this competition, we will gain the friendship.team.

My duty is working on Human Practices by communicating with cooperators and other iGEM teams, conducting investigations online, and organizing regular community-based scientific activities with my teammates. Social work may spend much time for graduated students, but it gives more opportunities to get out of laboratory to contact different people, listening to their needs. This will help us to design better productions to improve their life. I believe iGEM will be a fantastic experience for me to receive precious friendship and social responsibility.
