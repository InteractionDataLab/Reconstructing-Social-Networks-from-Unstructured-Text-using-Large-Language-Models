All of the infant formula milk powder is made with reference to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) and Chinese National Standards (CNS). By using high quality raw materials, in strict accordance with the international advanced production process and using closed purification and automatic production, Scient has ensured the nutrition, health and safety of the product. Then we drove to Scient industrial park located in economic and technological development zone, Guangzhou, to understand their technological process and quality control departments.</P><P class="clear">According to introduction, Scient industrial park has set up eight advanced food production lines. The automatic continuous production lines imported from INDOSA (Switzerland) and ROVEMA (Germany) which are the most advanced equipments in the world. Industrial park provides high quality production environment, in line with the GMP production specification, International standard operating procedures and professional system process. Production equipment and technology have reached the domestic leading level. Scient has got a variety of certifications, such as ISO 9001 quality management system, ISO14001environmental management system, OHSAS18001 occupational health safety assessment series, HACCP food safety management system and CMS integrity management system.</P><P class="clear">The supervisor of quality management department, Miss Chen, has introduced the main conditions of the quality management department for us. The quality management department was established in 2002, including three sections: Raw materials division, Process division and Central lab. There are more than 30 workers here. All the members has got the inspection qualification certificate, and their detection ability have reached domestic advanced level. Now They are preparing to apply for the identification of CNAS. This department adopts perfect quality supervision management system and imports the world class testing equipments, including the ultra high performance liquid - series level 4 pole mass spectrometer which are used to test the melamine and choline in milk powder. Its sensitivity can reach ppb level. With the strict product testing system and the production quality control system, they can ensure scientific and accurate testing data. They have passed the tests of many testing institutions which are accredited by CNAS, ensuring the quality of the products.</P><P class="clear">In the process of visiting, we introduced IGEM and Antibiotics detection to Miss Chen and showed her our experimental results. We introduced the theory and the method of testing tetracycline of our program. She showed strong interest in this. Compared with the traditional testing method, our biosensor is faster and more sensitive. If Large-scale use, it will be much cheaper. Miss Chen said, “Scient is lack of the testing method of tetracycline, and we are very interested in your project. If there is a chance, we can collaborate in the future.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="team_info">
