1. Buffers/Medium
     LB medium
           Sodium Chloride 10 g/L
           Tryptone 10 g/L
           Yeast extract 5 g/L
     For agar
           BacAgar (1%) 15 g/L
2. Add Restriction Enzyme Cutting Site
In the process of standardization, we need connect the modified fragment to the Connection of EcoRI, XbaI , SpeI, PstpS and B1C3. So we add this four Restriction Enzyme cutting site at the both ends of the modified fragment. The sequence are gaattcgcggccgcttctaga（5'→3'）=ecori-xbai, actagtagcggccgctgcag（5'→3'）=spei-psti, It make standardization be possible. EcoRI and Xbal are located upstream, SpeI and PstI are located downstream.

4. Add Restriction Enzyme Cutting Site
Experimental Material:
 1.5ml centrifuge tube, competent cells, LB Medium without penicillin.
 
Steps:
I.  Prepare the ice, the competent cells and mark the 1.5ml centrifuge tube.
II.  When the competent cells  dissolve in the ice, inject 50-60μL competent cells and 10μL ligation product into every centrifuge tube, put them in the ice for 30min.
III.  Water bath at 42℃ for 90s, then in the ice for 3-5min.
IV.  Inject 500μL LB fluid medium(without antibiotics) into the tube, blending and cultivate in the table concentrator at 37℃,120-150rpm for 45-60min.(when the bacteria returned to normal growth condition and expression the antibiotic resistance genes encoded by plasmid)
5. Screening and Identification
Experimental Material:
Sterilization toothpick, Medium plate with AMP, sealing film, mark pen.
 
Steps:
I.  Prepare the medium plate: When the autoclaving LB medium cooling to 50℃（protect the  antibiotic from inactivation）, add 1/1000 antibiotic, blending, pour into the plate fast. When the medium freeze, seal it with sealing film.
II.  Centrifuge the tube taken out from table concentrator at 4000rpm for 3min. Take 500μL supernatant, put the residuum in the super clean bench. Make it well-distributed with the pipettor. inhale and coating it(50μL) on the plate with corresponding resistance. When the liquid is absorbed by the plate entirely, place upside down the petri dish. Cultivate at 37 ℃ for 12-16h. Save the residuum at 4℃ for later use.
III.  Put the sterilization toothpick in the super cle an bench, turn on the UV lamp, after 20min, turn off the UV lamp.
IV.  Light the alcohol lamp, put the LB medium plate and the petri dish after transformation into the super clean bench.
V.  Find some single colony on the plate and stick them with the toothpick. Then put the toothpicks into the centrifuge tubes which have added the system for PCR. Turn off the centrifuge tubes, place them for some minutes and take out the toothpicks.
VI.  Save the petri dish at 4℃. Clean the super clean bench and turn off the switch.

6. Cultivate the Bacterium and Get the Plasmid
I.  chose the bacterium in the plate to get the single colony. Streaking in the super clean bench. Don’t rotate the spear and toothpicks when streaking.
II.  inoculate. Need to use the super clean bench.
III.  Pour the fluid medium into Sterilization tube when the liquid level arrive to 1/4. Add single colony into tube and put the tube in the table concentrator at 37℃，220rpm for a night.
IV.  Save the bacterium. Pour 750ml bacterium suspension and 250ml sterilization glycerol into the tube. There are13-1 and 14-16. One is in refrigerator at -20℃ and the other is at -80℃.
V.  Take 1ml bacterium suspension to sequencing.
VI.  plasmid extraction: use the High purity plasmids small kits of TianGen
7. Detection
Detect the segment inside of Restriction Enzyme cutting site and identify the effectiveness of standardization.
