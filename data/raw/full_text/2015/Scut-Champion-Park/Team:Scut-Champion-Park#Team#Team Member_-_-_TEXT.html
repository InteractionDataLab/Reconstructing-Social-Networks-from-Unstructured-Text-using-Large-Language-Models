I got to know the IGEM game from my classmate, Junjie Zhang, who has attended the IGEM game last year and  also been our Instructor this year. I think IGEM is a very interesting game, and I am also an active person, so I found a lot of like-minded friends to participate in the competition together. And I plan to apply for a PHD in the United States this fall for further study. I think this Boston trip will give me a real understanding of American College. I believe this game will be a precious memory for me.

I was very regret that there was no IGEM team of graduate in our university last year. But now I have joined the SCUT Champion Park team. When I know I can attend the competition, I am very excited. From my childhood, I see many competition of many subjects, but biology competition is very rare. IGEM is a competition of synthetic biology. The team needs to have the ability to control the input and output signal with technology of synthetic biology. In my mind, it is the best way to combine study with applying. How exciting it is to build the system for achieving the goal. In our team, I am a main experimenter, and I want to grow up with my team. I like challenge, and I think it will make life colorful. I believe in this competition, we will gain the friendship.team. I like challenge, I think it will make life rich and colorful. In the competition we can study together and gain the friendship.

I feel so delightful to have the chance to participate in the IGEM Game this year. I mainly focus on the human practice part in this team. I like thinking and design, but what I like most is to put what I have been thought and designed into practice and IGEM just happens to give me the chance to do so. Life is supposed to do things what are worthy of doing and I think join the SCUT Champion Park is counted on the lists. This precious experience can enable us to learn more and think more about science and its application. Let’s hope a wonderful summer vocation with IGEM!

It is my first time to participate in iGEM as a practitioner. My duty is working on Human Practices by communicating with cooperators and other iGEM teams, conducting investigations online, and organizing regular community-based scientific activities with my teammates. Social work may spend much time for graduated students, but it gives more opportunities to get out of laboratory to contact different people, listening to their needs. This will help us to design better productions to improve their life. I believe iGEM will be a fantastic experience for me to receive precious friendship and social responsibility.
