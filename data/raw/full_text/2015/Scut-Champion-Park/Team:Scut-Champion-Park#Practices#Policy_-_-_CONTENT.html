								Antibiotics are a type of product with antiviral potential or other activities which is produced by microorganism (bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes), higher animals and plants, or chemical synthesis methods. It can be classified as the following 8 types: (1)the Î²-lactams, such as penicillin, cephalosporin, etc.; (2) the aminoglycosides, such as streptomycin, gentamicin, etc.; (3) the tetracyclines, such as tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, and etc.; (4) the large ring lactones, such as erythromycin, etc.; (5) the benzene hydrocarbon amines, such as chloramphenicol, etc.; (6) the sulfonamides, such as sulfamethoxazole, benzyl methyl oxygen organism; (7) the quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, norfloxacin and levofloxacin; (8) and the others, like polyene big ring, polypeptide, anthracycline-based, etc. 

								Antibiotics are widely used in in our daily life. In clinical, it is often used to treat the infections which are caused by bacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia and other pathogens. Besides, it is also used in the research of science of life, agriculture, farming, animal husbandry and food industry. However, the abuse of antibiotics brings certain harms to both human health and the environment. The long-time intake of antibiotic (including clinical intake or food originated antibiotics residues) will lead to antibiotic accumulation in human body. When the concentration reaches to a certain value, it will result side effects to our hearing, kidney and immune system, cause allergy, and what's more, it even has the carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects, it can also enhance the pathogens' drug resistance, and inhibit the growth rate of the intestinal flora. 

								In this assay, we did a policy research on antibiotic residues in animal origin food by analyzing the residue standards, banned substances and determine methods among CAC,EU, and American. Besides, we also made a comparison to the maximum residue limits of tetracycline between the standards in different countries and a prospect about food safety regulation system in China was also proposed.

Furthermore, it accelerated the issue process of the Food Safety Law. </P><H2> 2.1 Regulatory agency  </H2><P class="pol-main-content">
								Nowadays, China's food safety management system has been established and becomes to play more and more important roles. According to the Food Safety Law, the State Council established Food Safety Commission with the main responsibilities to analyze the situation of food in China, put forward important measures to food safety regulations and supervise the implementation of food safety regulatory.  Ministry of Agriculture, National Department of Health and Family Planning Commission, State Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine, State Food and Drug Administration, and Commerce Department are in charge of the central government level's food safety management. </P><H2> 2.2 Applicable laws and regulations </H2><P class="pol-main-content">

								EU standards focus on the restrictions of veterinary drug residues and ensuring of food safety. Under the joint participation of Member States, (EU) No 37/2010 of veterinary drugs in animal foods MRLs Regulations were published and all member states should take this as the basis for regulations and better monitor the level of veterinary drug residues in foods of animal origin. The maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by (EU) No 37/2010 are the standard valve of controlling drug residues in animal origin foods. So far, the limitation set by (EU) No 37/2010 regulations is the alternative means and measures to control veterinary drugs residues. </P><H2> 3.1 Maximum residue limits of veterinary drugs </H2><P class="pol-main-content">
								In January, 2010, EU published the Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 âmaximum residue limits and classification of pharmacologically active substance in animal origin food ', which collected the veterinary drug MRLs that EU has developed.  

								The regulations made a integration to the 4 appendix content in (EEC) No 2377/90 of. For easy use, all pharmacologically active substances are listed alphabetically in the same appendix, and the established two tables. The substances which are allowed to be used are in Table 1, with a total of 635 kinds; Table 2 includes banned substances with a total of 10 species.

								In order to reduce the mass sample analysis cost and improve efficiency of the analysis, the EU usually use both screening methods and confirmatory analysis method together to detect food safety which is the so called &quot;two-step&quot; strategy. At first, the large numbers of samples were rapidly analyzed by screening. If it was suspected as positive sample, then it will be confirmed by confirmation methods. 

								EU's main sample separation and purification techniques are solid phase extraction (SPE), supercritical fluid extraction, immune affinity chromatography (IAC) technology, matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) technology and so on. Veterinary drug residue detection methods are mainly divided into fast testing, routine quantitative detection and confirmation methods, including EIA, RIA, TLC, HPTLC, GC, HPLC, LC-MS, GC-MS and the like.

								Tetracycline is a widely used broad-spectrum antibiotic and it is also the earliest antimicrobial drugs that attracted our attention in the food safety field. All countries have made relevant standards for tetracyclines residues. 

								Take the maximum residue levels of tetracycline in pork tissues as an example, in accordance with China's &quot;veterinary drugs in animal foods MRLs&quot;, the maximum residue of single or composite tetracyclines in pork should not exceed 100mg / kg, namely 100000Î¼g / kg. While The Codex Alimentarius Commission shall not exceed 200Î¼g / kg, EU rules must not exceed 100Î¼g / kg, and the FDA shall not exceed 2000Î¼ / kg. The maximum residue limit of tetracycline on pork products in China is 50 times higher than the United States and is 500 times as CAC's requirement. what's more, it is 1,000 times higher as the EU countries limited. Then take the dairy oxytetracycline maximum residue levels as another example. In China, the maximum residue levels in dairy set by Ministry of  

								Agriculture was that a single or composite oxytetracycline drugs should not exceed 100mg / kg, namely 100000 Î¼g / kg, while the Codex Alimentarius Commission is defined as not exceeding 100Î¼g / l, EU rules should not exceed 100 Î¼g / kg, and the US FDA shall not exceed 300Î¼g / kg. In other words, the maximum dairy oxytetracycline residue limits in China is about 333 times the US FD regulations, and about 1000 times CAC and EU regulations.

								In China, the food safety management system is still bull management. When it needs to get to the certain place, there will be many other departments that will be involved in, even the business sector, public security, urban management and other regulatory authorities. The supervision department is not entitled to enforcement powers, the law enforcement is carried out by the police, urban management, business execution and the daily supervision and sample preparation is executed by the quality supervision department, the health sector which results in multiple prevarication. 

								Most of China's laws and regulations about veterinary drug residues are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture in the form of public announcement, instruction and the like. It is lack of unified planning and hard to conducive search. It suggested that unified management for veterinary drug residue limits should be executed as soon as possible, put all the files related in order and clean up all the old scattered regulations and standards to adapt to the China's existing laws and regulations, set the lateral MRLs of veterinary drugs in the form of national standards, so that the residue limits will be more unity, rationality and practicality. 

								The recent situation shows that parts of the standards' version are out of date with slower update time, less coverage and irrational maximum residue limits which differs from that of CAC and FDA to a great extent. So it proposed to speed up the standard scientific research, develop reasonable standards and improve the detection technology to catch up with the international standards as soon as possible. 

								The limited public profile is another problem. Nowadays, only the national compulsory standards are available for free download on the relevant state ministries and commissions' website and a large number of mandatory industry standards and local standards which are not covered by national standards can still not be obtained for free. It suggested that the related department shall refer to the data base of maximum residue limits of veterinary drugs which is established by Codex Alimentarius Commission, make it available to inquiries the substance by drug name, drug classes, animal species and target tissues and other to facilitate public use. 

								MRLs of veterinary drugs in different countries and international organizations have both similarities and its own characteristics. Companies or regulatory authorities should carry out comparative analysis based on the products situation and the requirements of the output or input country. For the veterinary that China has laxer limits, the regulation should be strengthened to ensure that export products meet the requirements of the importing countries and regions. For the veterinary drug that does not allow the use of, or the absence of residues in Chin's limited requirements which is striker than that of foreign country, we should focus on monitoring implementation in imported animal origin foods.
