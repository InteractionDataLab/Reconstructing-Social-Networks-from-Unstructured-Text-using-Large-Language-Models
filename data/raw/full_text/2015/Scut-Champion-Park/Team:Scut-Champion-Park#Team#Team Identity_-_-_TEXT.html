Team Identity
We are SCUT Champion Park. Our team spirit is efficient and happy. In order to show the spirit and personality of our team, our designers have designed our own Team Identity.
Team Flag
The middle is our team logo. Our logo is a distortion of tetracycline, and combined with the first letter of our school name’s    abbreviation.
The color of home flag is the same blue as South China University of Technology's school badge, on behalf of passion and brave. The color of away flag is white which represents the exploring spirit of academic research.
Team Uniform
Our team uniform is a white long sleeve. The front logo combines the tetracycline and school English initials S, not only showing the scientific nature of biochemical research, but also highlighting the school name. The color, the same as our school’s badge, reflects the characteristics of calm. The back pattern is made of fluorescent material, passing out the modern sense.
Bookmark
The front of the bookmark is the abbreviation of South China University of Technology as a design element. These four letters combined with biological chemical elements. The color, including red, yellow and blue, is lively, generous and full of vitality. The team logo is on the opposite side making the bookmarks highly conspicuous.
Visual Identity
Our logo is derived from the molecular formula of tetracycline which is the main element of our experiment.Draw it out to a single regular hexagon as a creative element. The structure of this arrangement of hexagon is called a honeycomb structure. This structure reflects the feasibility and effectiveness of our research.
