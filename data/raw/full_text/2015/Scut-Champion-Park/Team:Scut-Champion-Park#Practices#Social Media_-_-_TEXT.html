Social Media -Wechat
Nowadays, the world becomes smaller and smaller due to the booming development of internet. As time goes by, the number of internet users becomes larger and larger which makes social media the most convenient access for people to get the information they need. In China, the digital media landscape is dominated by local players, like Wechat, QQ, Sina, Youku, Tudou and so on, among which Wechat is the most prevailing one. So we applied one Wechat subscription account (SCUTChampionPark) and use it to promote iGEM, food safety, and synthetic biology related issues in public. Besides, we also introduced our team, idea and our project. It kept going as our project went on, in private, we also use it to write all the big affairs we had during the process, to some degree, it kind of likes a memo. It noted most of the important point of our project.
Picture one is the QR code and also the identity of our Wechat subscription account which can be can be scanned by users to follow us.And the rest pictures are parts of our promoted articles.
