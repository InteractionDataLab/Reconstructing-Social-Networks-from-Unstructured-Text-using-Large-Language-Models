This is the third year that our school (South China University of Technology) teams participate in the IGEM. Compared to the previous two years, this year there will be three teams to participate IGEM in the name of South China University of Technology. Now, IGEM are very influential in our school, and also trained many students'​​interest and ability. Through the first two years' experience, we have learned that this game is not only need to invest a lot of energy, but also a lot of money. This year because of the number of teams is increasing, the supports from College for each team has a certain reduction in funding. In the early preparation, funding becomes the team's biggest problem. In order to ensure adequate funding, we have made various efforts, and got the support from many parties. Finally, we can come to Boston to attend the 2015 Giant Jamboree, and to communicate with the teachers and students from all over the world.
At last, we would like to sincerely thank SCUT, graduate school of SCUT, our college, the organizations and individuals who helped us in the process.
