SAFETY
Safety
Currently, the overuse of antibiotics has not been effectively regulated in China. A survey from 4152 Internet users of 31 provinces and autonomous regions in China shows that 74% investigation families have been or have equipped with antibiotics. Moreover, the application rate of antibiotics in hospitalized patients is 80% in China, far more than the           international standards (30%).
In order to solve the problem of food safety caused by the abuse of antibiotics, our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with          tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can instructs the tetracycline class of antibiotics by fluorescence detection.
