These are what we have accomplished this year:
We successully constructed our CACCI, genetically modifed bacteria used to sense antibitoics.
We successfully achieved bacteria adhesing to film by treated with polylysine.
We successfully developed a device called SPRING with optical module and electric circuit.
We successfully proved adhesion dynamics would be stable after 100s.
We successfully established interference pattern by our SPRING.
We successfully proved that interference patterns have difference between each other when treating in different antibiotic concentration.
We successully calibrated our NDM for antibiotics determination.
We successfully developed a series of program used to process our interference pattern and data.
We successully demonstrated that our NDM is able to interact with bacteria, and distinguish different antibiotic concentration by delivering different interference pattern.
Bronze:
Your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 6 goals:
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete the Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and                   document the team's parts (if any) using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for                   more information.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your                   project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish                   it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors,                   professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Develop a working prototype of an open-source hardware tool that supports synthetic                   biologists working with BioBrick standard biological parts. Document your tool on                   the project page on your team wiki.
Silver:
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must                 convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
Provide a demonstration of your hardware using a video tutorial that explains all                   the features of the hardware operation. Make the video available on your wiki. You                   must also send the video file to iGEM HQ (email hq [at] igem [dot] org). See                     our tutorial video in Tutorial-Instructional Video
Document your device on your wiki with information and associated files sufficient                   for a future iGEM team to reproduce your work. You should include relevant design                   schematics, 3d print files (or other), software and a Bill of Materials (BOM). Want to reproduce our NDM? Please visit Tutorial-Make                     your own
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to                   (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and                   intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in                   iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or                   more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub                   for more information.) See our Practices in Policy&Practices
Gold:
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your                 team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices                   activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the                   design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human                   Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves                   educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human                   Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous                   teams).See our Integrated Practices Activities in Policy&Practices-Integrated                     Human Practice
Help any other iGEM team utilize the hardware developed by your team. You must                   clearly show how your hardware was used and the results that were obtained. Results                   should take the form of a written report from the team testing the hardware and be                   posted on both team's wikis.
Select a previous iGEM Hardware project from any track and demonstrate how you have                   continued to work on the project by improving the functionality, ease of use, or                   documentation of another facet of the work/device.
Demonstrate your hardware at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. If your equipment is too large                   to transport, create an installation to demonstrate functionality. Note: you may not                   bring live biological materials to the Jamboree.

What will our NDM look like in future?
This is the introduction of USTC's NDM future plan, we will briefly introduce our improvement on our system.
Transformation of CACCI
In the future, CACCI will not just CACCI(that is characterization of antibiotics concentration based on chemotaxis and interference). Because of any possible molecules response promoter with integrated improvement in both chemotaxis and permeability. CACCI is able to detect anything in water as you wish. May we should substitute 'A' in CACCI in to '#', Let's say it C#CCI, or more academically, SBI, Standardized Biological Interface. As long as you get the bacteria powder you need, you can carry out experiments based on it or engineer it directly on it. My dear friend, isn't it cool?
SBI contains several modules:
Integrated Improvement(IITwins). This is constructed by us, which is able to share after packaging SBI. See how to package bacteria: Protocol: Package our CACCI .
Editable Biological Circuit(EBC). We provided several possible signal sensing circuits with amplification or modification for you, accompanied with USTC-Software's project, you are able to generate your own genetic circuit used to response molecules you wanna detect. In the furture, NDM will be not just Nanomachines Detecting Microbiotics, but Nanomachines Detecting Materials. Everyone can edit them and operate them!
Adhesion Preparation in Wide Adaptability(APWA). Two adhesion strategy is very widely adaptable for every user to construct new bacteria. Strategy I is based on polylysine coating, which doesn't need any genetic engineering. Though, Strategy II demands strict genetic modification, we are still able to share the bacteria with IITwins and tRNA plasmid in powder.
In the future, SBI will be collected in a professional database. You could find your SBI in a more convenient and accurate way.
We could expect the day when SBI is finally established and widely used. Synthetic biology would not just share parts, those genetic modules packaged in plasmid, but share devices, different specific functional modules packaged in bacteria. We are looking forward to that moment.
More Convenient User Experience
In the future, our GUI, that is graphic user interface, will finally be packaged in python, and it is for everyone. You can download it and install it for free. And now, GUI version in Matlab has already uploaded to Github, you can get them at: Github-USTC . We are very glad to share our ideas and get better.
An integrated circuit will be implemented into SPRING, which is able to strongly cut down the size of SPRING, though it has already convenient enough for people to detect molecules in field.
A more beautiful NDM: our designer will innovate several design plan to decorate our NDM. You could also decorate NDM by yourself. Come and join us!
Real Assay
In the future, NDM will be used to detect microbiotics in river sample, which is the most severe situation now in China. As well, drinking water and milk may also be as detection object.
NDM will also be able to detect other contaminates in water samples, such as heavy metal ions, toxic organic compounds and other chemicals. With everyone's SBI, specific detection in 100s can be achieved.
We will then operate NDM in real sample, any suggestions on improvement of NDM, please contact us:)
