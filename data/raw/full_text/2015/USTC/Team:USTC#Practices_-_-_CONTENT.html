We iGEM team established a club in our university called Encoding Life Association (ELA), especially for science education for children in China. This year iGEM, along with ELA, delivered an integrated human practice (IHP) activities for the public. In our human practice section, we combined general biology, molecular engineering and synthetic biology with public health, policies, art, movies, education, environment and society. We hope our human practice would deliver the public fresh ideas on scientific researches as well as build a communication bridge between public need and the frontier of science.</P><P>Our IHP this year includes several sections. You can visit them by directly clicking on their titles:</P><H4>Bacteria &amp; DNA </H4><P>The first two things about biology coming up in people’s minds must be bacteria and DNA. We always talk about them in our daily life. However, hardly anyone has seen them in person. So, we provided the opportunities for people, especially kids, to get access to megascopic bacteria and DNA, which are usually invisible, just as they are called as microorganism and molecules. </P><UL><LI>Look at your Handprint! A way to introduce the model organism and microorganism. This time, children are able to see microorganisms in their hands by culturing them on LB Medium directly. </LI><LI>DNA necklace DIY: An interesting activity held for kids in May. They are not only curious about make their own genome necklace, but felt cool on the mechanism of DNA introduced by our members. We saw their perfect work in necklaces, and we also enjoyed their smiles during the activity.</LI></UL><H4>iGEM</H4><P>After people had saw the tiny bacteria and DNA in a large scale, it was time for them to know about a latest track of biology—synthetic biology, and iGEM, the most important platform for youths to know and develop syhbio. </P><UL><LI>Wow, iGEM! A brief introduction of iGEM: A general introduction of iGEM and synthetic biology lecture for high school students. With the explanations by the leader of our team, kids began to know the basic principles of synthetic biology. And we found those children quite imaginative on synbio, neural science and molecular biology. </LI><LI>Cross Talk: Now we are expanding our connection from the public to the professionals. This professional cross talk section was held between CineCom (movie community) and sNC (natural conservancy). Through this talk, biotechnology means not only application, but imagination!</LI></UL><H4>Antibiotic pollution</H4><P>So what are we iGEM team exactly doing? This year, we are working on antibiotic pollution solving. According to our project, we held a water saving activity and launch a questionnaire survey. </P><UL><LI>Saving water, a lecture for iGEM: An introduction of the situation of waste and contamination of water around the world nowadays to the public. General biotechnology and previous iGEM projects on water cleaning are included in the lecture, as well as our draft ideas about nanomachines detecting trace antibiotics in water. This is the beginning of our integrated human practice in April.</LI><LI>Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and governance of antibiotics in China: This is a main human practice activity closely related to our project. We gathered data about people’s awareness of the issues of antibiotics contamination in China. This survey is really important in the promotion of antibiotic pollution and antibiotic resistance. </LI></UL><H4>Project online:</H4><P>the progress of our project is always put online. The platforms include Sina Weibo, Facebook and Renren.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Bacteria-DNA" class="row"><DIV class="card hoverable"><DIV class="col s12 m9"><DIV class="card-content"><H4 id="Bacteria-Handprints" class="scrollspy">Bacteria Handprints</H4><P>Hey kids, how many bacteria are in your hand? When you ask them, they may answer several thousand, million, or billion. To meet their curiosity, we deliver a handprint exhibition. However, this is a quite special handprint, which prints your hand on LB MEDIUM! Isn't it fun and cool?</P><P>Let's see our vice-captain, he is now preparing a demonstration for these kids!</P><H4 id="come-and-extract-the-genome-of-strawberries-" class="scrollspy">Come and extract the genome of strawberries!</H4><P>Attempting to attract more contemporary and children on synthetic biology, we built an activity called <STRONG><EM>Come and extract the genome of strawberries with our kitchen materials</EM></STRONG>. This activity firstly sent fundamental knowledge and mechanism of DNA extraction for the attenders. Then they started extracting DNA from strawberries according to the protocol we had prepared. Finally, with the assistance of our professional lab guys, they all successfully extracted white, filamentous DNA. Putting it into tiny bottles as the pendants of the necklaces.</P><P>One of a sci-freak major in organic chemistry in USTC laughed in those following words,</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>That was incredibly amazing! It is the first time that I saw DNA by myself. I cannot believe that we could simply extract DNA using table salt, cleanser essence and alcohol. Maybe next time we could try on our epithelial cells!</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col hide-on-small-only m3"><DIV class="toc-wrapper pinned"><UL class="section table-of-contents"><LI><A href="#Bacteria-Handprints">Bacteria Handprints</A></LI><LI><A href="#come-and-extract-the-genome-of-strawberries-">DNA Necklace DIY</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="iGEM" class="row"><DIV class="card hoverable"><DIV class="col s12 m9"><DIV class="card-content"><H4 id="biology-to-high-school-students" class="scrollspy">Wow! iGem!--Biology to High School Students</H4><P>A lecture on general molecular biology, synthetic biology and iGEM was held in August. Leader of USTC, Juntao Yu introduced the basic molecular biology mechanism and iGEM to high school students who were deeply intrigued in biology.</P><P>The leader firstly introduced the daily laboratory apparatus to the kids and students such as centrifuge, vibrator, PCR Instrument, high pressure steam sterilization pot, incubator and etc. We explained the mechanism of some of them and we were glad to see some middle school students caring about the working mechanism of centrifuge. So we continued teaching them more about the physic theories in it. It is pretty good to share our gains and losses with them and enlighten the kids who are interested in science.</P><P>Then, the leader held a small class for the kids: we exquisitely prepared a presentation specifically for kids to introduce to them the basic knowledge of DNA and genetic engineering with simple words and lovely pictures. We are surprised to know that children are aware of the word DNA, while they hardly understand the essence of it. So we instructed them about the scale, location, function, discovery and shape of DNA based on history and researches. Besides, genetic engineering was also introduced using chocolate biscuits as example. We hope kids can possess a memory about the mechanism in biological world and the seed sowed by us can prosper in the future.</P><P>Finally, a panel session was beginning: This session is for students and adults to know iGEM, establishment and history of our team built in 2007 and the future of synthetic biology and biological technology. Since recently the public in China is concerned about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) severely, we want to directly and briefly introduce to them the genetic engineering technology and let them judge whether the GMO is safe for our daily requires with our guidance. We tried our best to eliminate the gap between the fast developing science and puzzled people even if we finally managed to influence few. We still believe few can influence many with their constructive suggestions and going into action so that one day people in China, even all over the world, will go forward with science shoulder by shoulder.</P><H4 id="cross-talks" class="scrollspy">Cross Talks</H4><H5>CineCom</H5><P>CineCom, movie community of University of Science and Technology of China, is interested in communication with our iGEM team. Here is the record with their leader, Mr. ChiKeng Hwang.</P><P>USTC: Recently, many biological films released…… </P><P>CineCom: <EM>Jurassic World. </EM></P><P>USTC: I just want to say that. There are also some excellent dramas. For example, Orphan Black by BBC America. They are related to genetic engineering, cloning, and other hot topics. Are these topics now very popular in science fiction dramas? </P><P>CineCom: I think nowadays science fiction superhero plays the main theme of the majority of these movies because such script does not need too deep excavation, but only gorgeous special effects, which can gain substantial box office. </P><P>USTC: Yes, but haven’t the superheroes started to tiring us? In fact, the superheroes are human beings with specific features, perhaps one day, synthetic biology can realize the superhero story. </P><P>CineCom: Their superpowers are innate. I do not know much about synthetic biology, I think it might undermine the law of natural evolution.</P><P>USTC: Probably, ethics is a very important issue, let’s take the X-Men for it, I think if there is a group of people with specific abilities in the world, maybe the order will be destroyed. </P><P>CineCom: From the perspective of evolution, the evolution of our abilities is to meet the real needs. For example, at paramecium stage, we can only engulf and divide; until the evolution of adult classes, we have the ability to build and engineer. If humans grant the paramecium human strength, it will only continue to devour and split, instead of construction and renovation. If a similar situation occurred to humans because of the synthetic biology, it will result in catastrophe. I think this is precisely the potential threat of the &quot;super heroes&quot;. </P><P>USTC: Cool! It seems that you are a superhero fan! So besides superheroes, do you think these dramas are in line with scientific principles? For example, the black hole in Interstellar and the theory of clone in Orphan Black? </P><P>USTC: What do you think can science and movies collaborate? </P><P>CineCom：The movie is actually a kind of media. So there are lots of collaborations in the progress of filming and screening. These are some applications of the techniques, but not science researches. </P><P>USTC: Thank you. </P><H5>sNC</H5><P>sNC, natural conservancy of USTC is a student organized association. Now, we invited their leader Mr. ChungKim Whang.</P><P>sNC: The main activities of natural conservancy of USTC are bird observing and cradling. Meanwhile, we are committed to promote ecological balance and popularize environmental protection knowledge on campus.</P><P>USTC: Sounds like we have a lot to communicate. How fast do the birds extinct around the world? </P><P>sNC: With the reduction of wetlands, and the destruction of the habitats of the migratory birds, the birds are facing unprecedented pressure to survive, not only birds, many other species’ extinction rate is higher than last century.</P><P>USTC: Certainly. Species conservation now becomes a hot topic. From your perspective, does molecular biology contribute to species protection? Can we preserve the genomes of the extinct species and use them to culture new ones? </P><P>sNC：Molecular biological researches on genes provide us with a better reference of classification and explanations of the reasons for extinction from the microscopic point of view. For the endangered species, if they cannot adapt to the natural changes, humans cannot help them, either. As for the species under the threats of human destruction, humans should not look for ways to protect them just to cover up their bad damage to them. Your proposed method can only save genomes, but to keep the species alive, suitable environments should be maintained, which cost lots of manpower and resources. </P><P>USTC: That is actually molecular biology did not play a significant role in animal protection?</P><P>sNC：I certainly believe that molecular biology and ecology are closely connected, but generally speaking, science develops focusing on the needs of society, for example, pharmaceuticals. We do not pay enough attention to the treatment of animals suffering from the disease, because generally it seems to follow the laws of nature, sick and old animals should be eaten by predators, so that evolution goes forward. However, the improvement in medical conditions extend humans life span and promote humans well-being. So this is not an individual can decide, but will reach a uniform height in the future.</P><P>USTC: Oh, I see. So what do you do to propagate ecological knowledge? </P><P>sNC：For eco-propaganda, public misunderstanding about it is just like the one about genetic engineering. People judge things based on subjective preferences of decision, and therefore does not comply with the laws of nature. Protection of nature is not to protect animals from being eaten, nor to raise endangered animals until prosperous progenies. We usually start from the child, giving lectures in primary schools. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col hide-on-small-only m3"><DIV class="toc-wrapper pinned"><UL class="section table-of-contents"><LI><A href="#biology-to-high-school-students">Wow! iGem! </A></LI><LI><A href="#cross-talks">Cross Talks</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Antibiotic-pollution" class="row"><DIV class="card hoverable"><DIV class="col s12 m9"><DIV class="card-content"><H4 id="water-cleaning-technology-lecture" class="scrollspy">Water Cleaning Technology Lecture</H4><P>In April 14th, we USTC iGEM along with our supervised Encoding Life Association (ELA) held a lecture on water cleaning technology based on common physical and chemical technology as well as some biological engineered technology. During this lecture, our team member introduced some intriguing methods that provided by previous iGEM teams, including genetically modified phytoremediation of TU-Munich 2013 iGEM team and biological replacement of heavy metal ion contamination in water. These illustrations met many children's curiosity on what amazing works synthetic biology had made. </P><P>Then, our team members briefly introduced iGEM and our projects to the audience. Our simple interpretation on our chemotaxis and interference approach is so fascinating that many adults strongly changed their perspective on genetically engineered bacteria and molecular biology. They all hoped these incredible jobs would make more contribution to our human being, environment and the earth.</P><H4 id="Saving-Earth-Saving-Water-Theme-Activity" class="scrollspy">Saving Earth, Saving Water, Theme Activity</H4><P>In April 27th to 28th, a theme activity called <STRONG><EM>Saving earth, saving water</EM></STRONG> was established in University of Science and Technology of China. We iGEM team, cooperating with Encoding Life Association (ELA), Natural Conservancy organized promotion and introduction to the public.</P><P>At the beginning, our host briefly introduced the situation we human-being encountering in China. Many solutions from different countries were put into discussion with them. And we exhibited dozens of posters that containing information on policies and laws related to environment, water contamination and so forth. </P><P>Demonstrably, biologically engineered technology implemented by previous iGEMers were introduced to our audience. Besides, our project was also mentioned during this activity. It was the first time that people had seen such incredible work done by <EM>E. coli</EM> and other engineered species. Many people said, taking part in this activity made them better and deeper understand the magnificent work that synthetic biology could achieve. Children wrote down their dreams on our broad, some of whom proudly promised that they would join in iGEM, were they admitted to university one day!</P><P>In order to make our audience better enjoy these galleries, activities, we designed dozens of questions. Individuals who answered them would receive a tiny but useful gift from us. The activity finally attracted hundreds of people joining us, which made such big contribution to evoke public cognition on water and other environmental issues.</P><H4 id="survey" class="scrollspy">Survey on the civic awareness of the use, pollution and administrating of antibiotics</H4><P>Antibiotics are widely used on both human and animal in order to defense the illness caused by bacteria. Since the discovery of penicillin, medical science in infectious diseases has made great progress. However, people do not totally overcome such illness, but face more complex and intractable ones. How come? The abuse of antibiotics is the ringleader because it causes antibiotic resistance. Nowadays, the unsupervised discharge of antibiotics arouses a big concern about their negative impacts on ecosystem and human health. So far there is a lack of information on emission inventory and environmental fate of antibiotics in China. </P><P>Consequently, there is great necessity to make the crowd acknowledge of the proper usage of antibiotics. </P><P><STRONG>Sample size &amp; distribution</STRONG>223 people, most of whom are students in their teens or early twenties, received our survey. </P><P><STRONG>1. Usage of antibiotics in daily life</STRONG>Nearly all of them used antibiotics when they are ill, but only 62% of them use them strictly following the doctor’s advice. It indicates that a number of people neglect the side effect that the abuse of antibiotics may cause.</P><P><STRONG>2. Knowledge of antibiotics resistance</STRONG>More than 95% of them know that antibiotics can cause antibiotics resistance. And among them, there are a few even have read some related news and researches. </P><P><STRONG>3. Attention to antibiotics pollution</STRONG>But only very few of them care and get to know about whether the pollution of antibiotics approaches to our environment and our daily life. Nearly half of the people hold an optimistic attitude on the antibiotics residue in food and drinking water.
              When asked about the source of the pollution, more than 80% believe that the major blame of the antibiotics residual should be hospitals, but in fact, the usage on human is only 16%, while on veterinary, 84%. As is often the case that the boss is out of sight, people can only notice the tiny part of the pollution while the primary is obscured—because people can never believe that certain antibiotics, sulfamonomethoxine, for example, used on the animals in their plates can be a hundred times more than that on themselves.
              The data show that only 1% of people know the concrete condition, and the rest 99% of people are only guessing or even totally unaware of the consumption of antibiotics of China. Actually, each year China consumes ten times more antibiotics than major developed countries even standardized by population. And in 2013, China even consumed half of the antibiotics in the world.
              So we can see that people know a little about the dangerous resistance via media, but their concept about this severe problem is still vague.
              <STRONG>4. Techniques and synthetic biology applied in solving antibiotics pollution</STRONG>In regard to the techniques to detect antibiotics in water, people seem to be blind, let alone the difficulties we meet in the specific detection of the types and the concentration of the antibiotics.
              Above all, people know little about what danger that antibiotics pollution brings. Thus, further publicity is needed.
              According to the last part of the questionnaire, although few of them have heard of synthetic biology, they are positive about biological techniques in detecting antibiotics. Synthetic biology, a new method, promising it is, we believe it will have wonderful application in solving antibiotics pollution.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col hide-on-small-only m3"><DIV class="toc-wrapper pinned"><UL class="section table-of-contents"><LI><A href="#water-cleaning-technology-lecture">Water Cleaning Technology Lecture</A></LI><LI><A href="#Saving-Earth-Saving-Water-Theme-Activity">Saving Earth, Saving Water, Theme Activity</A></LI><LI><A href="#survey">Survey</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Project-online" class="row"><DIV class="card hoverable"><DIV class="col s12 m9"><DIV class="card-content"><P>This year, we continued developing our online account in Facebook and Weibo.
