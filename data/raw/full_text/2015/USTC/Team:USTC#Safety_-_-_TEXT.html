Laboratory Safety
The biological materials involved in our project are microorganisms and modified plasmids.
For bacteria, this summer, our team worked mainly with nonpathogenic E.coli (strains: Top 10 & BL21) under BL1 standard. However, we extracted two parts (OprF & CheZ) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may cause Charrin's disease. P. aeruginosa is classified to BL2 so special attentions were paid to the relevant experiments. We strictly follow the BL2 standard, use the proper equipment and reach the level of protection.
Before the experiments started, we fully prepared for the biosafety in lab. Our team members designedly studied The Regulations of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms Safety as well as The Regulations of Pathogenic microbial laboratory biosafety, in order to check whether we meet relevant local and national safety standards and offer biosafety training to every member in the wet-lab. During all the experimental period, the regulations were obeyed.
Meanwhile, to keep us safe from hazardous chemicals and organisms, personal protective equipment, such as gloves, respirators and lab coats, were required during the experiment.
Safety Lecture
In August, our lab delivered a severe lecture on biosafety. Our presenter briefly introduced The Regulations of Agriculture Genetically Modified Organisms Safety as well as The Regulations of Pathogenic microbial laboratory biosafety to all members no matter who are conducting biological experiment or not.
This lecture is really important for a professional expert to conduct experiment not only following basic and regular rules but also protecting themselves.
Parts
This year, none of the new parts will raise safety issues for further applications in the current knowledge.
Applications
Microorganism auxiliary to the device (CACCI) is genetically engineered E.coli, carrying micF, SoxS, Cas9, CheZ and OprF. Even all the parts have been proved no harm to the public usage, we still take genetic safety into consideration.
Microorganism will be conglutinated to the film and then encapsulated. Conveyance before applying can be ensured convenient and secure. Our device detects the sample in a box without the need of contact and contagion. The real device will be made in bacteriostatic plastic, ulteriorly lower the risk of genetic contamination.
Besides, strains concerned are laboratory strains. Even leaked to the environment, they are not competitive enough to survive and threaten the environment and public health.
Protection Guide
This protection guide is especially for people who are interested in making NDM their own or who will use NDM for material detection. To prevent possible hurt, those safety methods are defined by ourselves.
When you are making NDM, many tools are needed, as well as touching bacteria solution. Consequently, we provided four recommended protective measures for everyone. Please pay attention to personal safety when doing experiment:
Class A: Fundamental protective measure when producing NDM and conducting experiment. You may wear lab coat. When conducting experiments and assemble NDM, level A should be satisfied always.
Class B: In level B, personnel should not only wear lab coat, but wear nitrile gloves or latex gloves, which are necessary when touching bacteria solution. This procedure is the first step for detection.
Class C: Level C is the standard protocol for personnels when drilling. In addtion to level A, you should wear goggles. Goggles would protect your eyes when you are drilling plexiglass. And please do remember ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES to prevent possible hurts and DO NOT WEAR GLOVES because it is not convenient when drilling.
Class D: This is the most complicated protective measure for spraing painting procedure. One should wear lab coats, along with goggles, masks and gloves to toally protect oneself considering extreme pungent odor volatilizing when painting.
