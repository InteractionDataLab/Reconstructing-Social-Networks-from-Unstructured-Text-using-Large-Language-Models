Growth Characterization
We firstly characterized the growth rate of genetically modified CACCI along with wild                                 type BL21 using optical density at 600 nm, which is called OD 600, in order to                                 demonstrate that the overexpression of porin(OprF with T7, BBa_K1593209 )                                 or viroporin(SCVE with T7, ( BBa_K1593667 )                                 won't severely affect the growth of bacteria, at least it won't significantly inhibit                                 bacteria growth and become a kill switch.
All bacteria are cultured previously in LB medium about 12 h. And then the measurement of                                 bacteria growth through time began at 8 A.M. the other day.
Figure 8: Bacteria growth characterization
As the images above illustrated, we found E. coli BL21 wild type has the best                                 growth characteristics with a maximal OD600=3.427. Whereas E. coli BL21 with                                 OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) has a                                 relatively low optical density as its OD600 after 12 h is 2.808 compared to the                                 wildtype. In the same way, characterization of E. coli BL21 with SCVE, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1593667 showed a slightly smaller OD600, as its finally turned to 2.835. E. coli BL21                                 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) and E. coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 )                                 are showing 19% decreased maximal cell density and 18.5% decreased maximal cell density                                 respectively in comparison with wild type.
Consequently, the result implies that the genetical modification on bacterial                                 permeability, at least the overexpression of OprF and SCVE with a strong promoter T7,                                 won't significantly influence the bacterial growth. Thus, genetically modified bacteria                                 can be used in the following experiments.
Later on, we will characterize the basic permeability capability of E. coli BL21                                 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) and E. coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 ).
ONPG Assay
Figure 9: ONPG reaction
ONPG, that is the abbreviation of ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-galactoside. ONPG is a colorimetric                                 and spectrophotometric substrate, previously used for detecting β-galactosidase                                 activity. ONPG is actually colorless at normal situation, however if it triggers the                                 degradation reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, we will get galactose and                                 ortho-nitrophenol. Surprisingly, the compound ortho-nitrophenol has a yellow color,                                 which means we are able to detect the chemical reaction through OD detection. Besides,                                 owing to the existence of β-galactosidase in bacteria, a more intense optical density we                                 detected, that means there are more ONPG uptaked by bacteria. Therefore, using ONPG we                                 are able to distinguish the permeability capability of different bacteria.
Here's our result.
Note: The wavelength for detecting the bacterial concentration and absortion of ONPG are                                 respectively 600nm and 406nm.
First, we detected the bacterial solutions to control the initial concentrations.
Figure 10: ONPG assay schematic show
The OD values for E.coli BL21, E.coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) , E.coli BL21 with T7-SCVE( BBa_K1593667 )                                 are respectively 2.856,1.806 and 1.889. Based on these, we know that the concentrations                                 of these three bacteria are close.
Then we add ONPG to the bacterial solutions and detect the OD.
Figure 11: ONPG assay, absorption OD406
From this figure, we can see a rising trend in all bacterial solutions. The OD values for E.coli BL21 with T7-OprF( BBa_K1593210 )                                 and E.coli BL21 with T7-SCVE( BBa_K1593667 )                                 are respectively 0.2520 and 0.2588,both are higher than E.coli BL21,the wild                                 type. We can infer that the absorbtion of modified bacteria is higher than the wild                                 type.
There is a more visual figure for comparing the absorbtions. We made a zero calibration                                 using the OD value of wild type as the zero level.
Figure 12: ONPG assay, absorption OD406 in average
In general, the OD values of both two modified bacteria are rising. For E.coli BL21 with T7-OprF( BBa_K1593210 ),                                 the rising is relatively smooth. For E.coli BL21 with T7-SCVE( BBa_K1593667 ),the value goes                                 down first, then goes up .And the E.coli BL21 with T7-SCVE( BBa_K1593667 ) has a higher                                 absorbtion than E.coli BL21 with T7-OprF( BBa_K1593210 ).
NPN Assay
Figure 13: Schematic Structure of N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine, NPN
N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine(NPN),C16H13N, CAS:90-30-2, FW: 219.29, is a nonpolar probe,                                 whose fluorescence signal is relatively strong in a phospholipid environment, but weak                                 in aqueous surroundings. Consequently, using this feature, we are able to characterize                                 bacteria permeability by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the bacteria solution. When NPN molecules are absorbed by bacteria, we will observe a significantly rising                                 fluorescence intensity. The more fluorescence intensity we got, the more permeable the                                 bacteria are. Here are what we got from NPN uptake assay and the conclusion on                                 genetically engineered bacteria permeability improvement.
Here's our results, the first picture illustrate the total fluorescence intensity                                 measurement by BMG Labtech                                     CLARIOstar® .
Note: The fluorescence intensity signal at excitation wavelength range is 305nm                                 to 335nm and emission wavelength range is 370nm to 410nm, which is recommended by                                 previous research.
Figure 14: NPN uptake result-1
The total fluorescence intensity of E. coli BL21 wild type is 126451. On the                                 other hand, the fluorescence intensity in E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) and E.                                     coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 )                                 are respectively 207322 and 151820, which are significantly larger than the wildtype                                 assay.
Though we have already got the exact data on NPN uptake, we still need to revise its                                 effectiveness because of the different bacteria concentration of E. coli BL21                                 wild type, E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) and E.                                     coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 ).                                 Here is the exact bacteria concentration data, based on OD600nm,
Strain
OD600nm
E. coli BL21 wild type

2.431
E. coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 )
2.441
After correcting these data, we are able to get bacteria absorption uptake capability in                                 average, which is a more accurate value to characterize bacterial permeability                                 property.
Figure 15: NPN uptake result in average
The fluorescence intensity in average of E. coli BL21 wild type is 34521.16. On                                 the contrary, the fluorescence intensity revised by bacterial concentration in E.                                     coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 )                                 and E. coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 ) are                                 respectively 85282.60 and 62195.8, which are relatively 2.5 folds and approximately 2                                 folds to E. coli wild type, that is a significantly improvement compared to                                 wild type.
Consequently, through NPN uptake assay, we are able to conclude that the small molecule                                 uptake capability of bacteria improved after our genetical modification. Thus E.                                     coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 )                                 and E. coli BL21 with T7-SCVE, ( BBa_K1593667 ) are both able                                 to use as the candidate bacteria strains for NDM measurement.

Growth characteristics
We detected OD600(nm) to identify the effect                                 of cheZ ( BBa_K1593997 ) expressed                                 on E. coli BL21 with time induced by IPTG or not.
Figure 5: Growth characteristics of BL21 WT with lac-cheZ [BBa_K1593997](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1593997) induced by IPTG or not
As the images above illustrated, we found E. coli BL21 wild type has the best                                 growth characteristics with a maximal OD600=2.6. Whereas E. coli BL21 with cheZ                                 ( BBa_K1593997 ) induced by ITPG has                                 a relatively low optical density as its OD600 after 9 h is 2.3 compared to the wildtype.                                 In the same way, characterization of E. coli BL21 with cheZ ( BBa_K1593997 ) not induced by                                 IPTG showed a slightly smaller OD600, as its finally turned to 2.1. The exogenous                                 protein expression affects the growth of bacteria, which was indicated by slight slower                                 grow-up in E. coli containing cheZ plasmid. In total, cheZ doesn't have obvious                                 negative impact on bacteria grown.
SDS-PAGE
After induced by IPTG in 1mM about 4 h, cheZ was found in                                 SDS-PAGE gel, compared to the wild type (Top10) and bacteria without IPTG induction.                                 Through this result, we concluded that cheZ has been successfully expressed with the                                 IPTG induction.

Characterization of Optimal Conditions on Polylysine(PLL) Coated Assay
To see the details on the mechanism of polylysine adhesion, please refer to Project-CACCI .
To get the final PLL-coated protocol, check Protocols for further information.
Our original characterization of optimal conditions on polylysine(PLL)-coated assay                             requires several factors to get, including:
Best bacterial developmental interval along with recommended dilution conditions.
Best PLL-Coated Concentration and Pre-treatment Time.
Best PLL-Coated Time, given full consideration to the completion of bacterial                                 adhesion time.
Best Measurement Interval, which illustrates the possible time for bacterial                                 response on antibiotics pressure.
Possible Determination Interval, which refers to antibiotics response interval.
Here we present all the optimistic conditions for users to get the effective results on                             antibiotics using our CACCI and SPRING.
Best Bacterial Developmental Interval Along with Recommended Dilution                             Conditions
According to experience on E. coli development based on OD detector. We                             concluded that bacteria exploding during Logarithmic Period(OD:535nm about                                 0.4~0.5) are at the most energetic moments with proper bacterial density.                             Consequently, we highly recommend user to culture bacteria at Logarithmic Period and                             then dilute bacterial solution about twenty times to fifty times.
Best PLL-Coated                             Concentration and Pre-treatment Time.
Best PLL-Coated Conditions, which include PLL-Pretreatment time, PLL-Coated concentration                             and PLL-Coated time are measured for best adhesive condictions for bacterial                             treatment.
As for PLL-Pretreatment time, we adopt traditional pretreatment time, incubating about                             12~16 h, for recommendation, which is originally used for neurons coated on neural                             science research. And when it comes to PLL-coated concentration, experience on neurons                             adhesion is also precious. According to previous research, PLL concentration in the                             interval of 20 ug/mL to 100 ug/mL is quite effective for bacterial adhesion.
Adhesion Assay with PLL                             treatment
Here we deliver the PLL treatment                             results comparing with no PLL treatment assay. During pre-experiment adhesion assay,                             PAO1, a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is used for adhesion effects.
The picture below showed the amount of bacteria(PAO1) under microscope without PLL                             treatment, which is abbreviated as PLL(-). To observe capability of bacterial adhesion,                             we wash observed place with PBS:

After elution, a significant decline in the number of bacteria is recorded. As a matter                             of fact, there is no bacteria in observed field after PBS washing.
To get the algorithm of bacterial counting, please refer to Modeling: Adhesion Dynamics .
Figure 2: Control Assay-Without PLL treatment2
As for treatment with PLL in 20 ug/mL, which is abbreviated as PLL(+,20), the impressive                             adhesion effect is observed. To ensure the exact effect, bacteria observing field is                             washed twice by PBS.
Figure 3: Adhesion Assay-With PLL treatment in 20 ug/mL
The number of bacteria doesn't decline, and on the contrary, we see slight increase of                             bacteria number. The possible reason is constant bacterial settlement during adhesion                             assay. After twice PBS wash, the number of bacteria is relatively stable as well.                             Consequently, we concluded PLL has significant adhesive ability on bacteria.

Best PLL-Coated Time
Then, we tried to figure out the cohesive effect of polylysine through time to get the best PLL-coated time. We gathered data just after                             PLL treatment(0s), after 1min and after 5min. And we also recorded bacteria number in                             the following 20 s. Here we provide the analysis of bacterial number variation after PLL                             treatment.We respectively use PAO1, a kind of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and HCB1,                             a kind of E. coli to handle the assay. PAO1 contains self-adhesive ability and                             HCB1 has strong mobile ability. Using these genetically natural bacteria, we would                             conclude with the effect of polylysine treatment.
As for PAO1, Without polylysine coated, bacteria have strong swimming ability.                             Because PAO1 is a kind of self-adhesive bacteria for experiment, thus we could see                             adhesive bacteria increasing during assay.
Figure 5: no antibiotics bacterial number variation through time without PLL
With 20 ug/mL polylysine treatement, bacterial adhesive effect due to strong                             electrostatic adhesion becomes stronger, and we, as well are able to observe the number                             of adherent bacteria gradually rising until reaching equilibrium.
Figure 6: no antibiotics bacterial number variation through time with PLL
After mathematical simulation we found that the adhesion rate of PAO1 by polylysine after                             treatment of PLL is increased, while for E. coli, the adhesion quantity rise, not                             fall.
As for HCB1, a kind of E. coli and the number of bacteria inside                             observed field is stable and relatively declined because of its lack of capability of                             adhesion.
After treated with 20ug/mL polylysine, adhesive bacteria number obviously                             increased:

This significant reverse of bacterial adhesion tendency stronly proved that polylysine                             has effective adhesive ability for SPRING.
After we confirmed the feasibility of PLL treatment for bacterial adhesion, then the                             treating time should be taken into consideration because only in the case of stable                             adhesion is effective for SPRING to gather effective and stable data.
As the plot illustrates, bacteria number is growing at the beginning of PLL treatment                             because of opening strong electrostatic adsorption derived from PLL. And after 1min, the                             number of bacteria become stable, and there is nearly no difference on bacteria number                             comparing after 1 min treatment to after 5 min treatment.
Consequently, we recommended that PLL treatment after 5 min would be a promising set for                             SPRING to output stable data.

According to chemotaxis, bacteria responsing to surrounding pressure or beneficits will                             be presented as change of bacteria movement. Here we analyzed bacterial movement data                             treating with different antibiotics concentration, specificly, chloromycetin                             concentration. And we gathered bacterial movement data just after antibiotics                             treatment(0s), after 1 min treatment and after 5 min treatment, and we again recorded                             all pictures in the following 18 s to get the dynamic data. Then, we concluded from the                             percentage of bacterial movement as an important data to intercept the effect of                             bacterial response on antibiotics.

When bacteria are treated with PLL, the movement of bacteria is been limited for strong                             adhesion, after 5 min treatment, the proportion of movement decreased through                             time.
However, when bacteria are not treated with PLL, incubated in 1ug/mL chloromycetin                             solution, we got the movement percentage of bacteria as following:
The amount of moving bacteria is relatively increasing after 5 min antibiotics treatment.                             Bacause of no PLL treatment, we could see the relative increase of bacteria movement                             percentage.
As for bacteria treated with 20 ug/mL PLL, different pattern is observed:
This is the bacterial movement percentage variation with time, treated with 0.1 ug/mL                             chloromycetin solution. Antibiotics pressure is not that strong, consequently, the                             movement of bacteria is not ignited significantly.
When it comes to 0.5 ug/mL chloromycetin solution, the proportion of the moving bacteria                             is increased. And as a matter of fact, the increase is quite corresponding through time,                             reflecting bacteria impressive response on antibiotics substance.
What if the concentration of chloromycetin solution up to 1 ug/mL?
A                             quite linear increase of the proportion of the moving bacteria with time is observed.
Consequently, according to our experiment, genetically naturally bacteria could respond                             to chloromycetin solution from 0.1 ug/mL to more than 1ug/mL, which is quite promising                             after genetic modification.

Let's do some crasy science this time! We'll show you how we test and select the most                             important part in our project, the special artificial original film!
Modeling guide us choose the                             candidates
In our modeling, we start with single bacteria force, analyse the interaction between                             bacteria and film, and propose the request of Young modulus (<1GPa) of film                             eventually.
And there are various film candidates come into the front.
Processing Film
The film must be kind of soft and one of the surface should have enough reflectance while                             another surface should have the ability to adhere to bacteria.
In fact, we don't hear any                             of this type of film. So we need to produce the film by our own.
Film I
Low Pressure Polyethylene
Figure 1: Film I, polyethylene
Low pressure polyethylene is soft enough, and is too soft.
We use aerosol paint cover one of the surface. That can make the other surface of the film                             will become a reflect surface. And we use 400ul 20ug/ml PLL coating the same surface at the                             temperature of 4℃ to make this surface has the ability to adhere to bacteria.
But we fail with film I in the end that we can't get interference fringes.                             Because the surface of low pressure polyethylene is not as smooth as we want, that will                             cause a diffuse reflection. Thus we can not get interference inescapably.
So we need the film becoem more smooth and more elastic, and then come out film                             II-Rubbers
Film II
Rubbers-Condom
Figure 2: Film II, condom
If you want the material smooth enough and thick enough and elastic enough, that is, of                             cause, condom!
When we plan to use paint cover, the truth give us a hard hit. Because the film shrink too                             much when we spray paint.
And we try silver mirror reaction as replacement. But still fail Because the ammonia erosion                             is too severe.
Finally we find the final film candidate that we missed-Glass
Film III
Cover slip
Figure 3: Film III, Cover slip
The Young modulus of Glass is about 50GPa. But according to our adhesion                             assay result and modeling, there will several numbers of fringes changes in the                             experiment.
So we spraying it, coating it, testing it, and we made it!
The glass have a great                             potential to reflect, so we can get interference very easy.
With modeling guidance, we                             can know the relation between fringes changes and antibiotics concentration.
\(A_{0}+\frac{B_{0}}{A}=\frac{1}{\Delta N}\)
Then we want to develop a calibration with three point.
Figure 5: Experimental results of calibration
The fitting result indicate that                             our modeling and normalization operation was exactly correct and effective. OUR                                 CRAZY MIND HIT OUR MODEL, AND OUR MODEL EXACYLY HIT OUR RESULT! WE LOVE                                 SCIENCE!
That means the Processed Glass worth the name of special artificial                             original film!

You can detect various of kinds of material in solution, as long as you follow our standard to make the engineered bacteria. See our future NDM improvement plan at Future NDM
There is one thing to be sure is that whatever bacteria you used, you need to build calibration ruler to measure the concentration quantificationally. According to our modeling in calibration we need to confirm three constants 'A0', 'B0', 'n'.
\(A_{0}+\frac{B_{0}}{A}=\frac{1}{\Delta N}\)
That means we need to test at least three point to confirm the formula.
Establishement of the Calibration Ruler
To build a calibration ruler between chloramphenicol concentration and
interference fringes pattern.
In this case we use our E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ), a type of bacteria in the best perfomance during genetically modification.(See our modification at Results-Permeability Improvement ). According to our experiment results, we found the E. coli BL21 with T7-OprF ( BBa_K1593210 ) was more sensitive to chloramphenicol.
And according to adhesion pre-experiment we chose the concentration range with 0.5ug/ml~5ug/ml in the experiment.
The changes of fringe number and test concentration shown below(take three pictures in a row with the time interval 20s),

Then we can fit this data with calibration formula, assume n=3(through trying different value of n get the best value of n) then get the simplified formula:
\(A_{0}+\frac{B_{0}}{A}=\frac{1}{\Delta N}\)
Then the fitting result illstruates as,
And we can get the value of unknown constants:

What an amazing result! The fitting result indicated that our modeling and normalization operation was exactly correct and effective. OUR CRAZY MIND HIT OUR MODEL, AND OUR MODEL EXACYLY HIT OUR RESULT! WE LOVE SCIENCE!
Reverification of Calibration
There may some arguement on our accuracy on calibration. So we need to conduct another experiment to reverficate our calibration ruler.
In order to test whether the calibration is correct and to confirm the coefficients, we choose two concentration as check point.
And use SPRING to measure its concentration. The real concentration and experiment results shown in table:
