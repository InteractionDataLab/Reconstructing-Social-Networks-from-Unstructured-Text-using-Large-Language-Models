This year, we choose several parts to conduct our projects. The main functions of the                             function we use are as follow:
Promoters.
Proteins to improve the bactial permeability.
Porins.
Proteins to improve the mobile of bacteria.
Sense system.

BBa_K1593207
micF
Promoter sensing sulfoamid
BBa_K1593208
SoxS
Promoter sensing tetracycline
BBa_K1593209
OprF
The major porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa allowing diffusion of polysaccharides in a                                     range of 2000 to 3000 Da.
BBa_K1593666
SCVE
SARS Coronavirus Envelope Protein, improving the bactial permeability.
BBa_K1593998
cheZ
Chemotactic protein. When it is overexpressed, the mobility of bacteria will be                                     improved.
BBa_K1593667
T7-RBS-SCVE
Circuit containing strong expression of SCVE regulated by T7, which will                                     significantly improve bacterial permeability.
BBa_K1593210
T7-RBS-OprF
Using T7 strong promoter to express OprF, derived from Pseudomonus areuginosa, would                                     strongly improve the bacterial permeability.
BBa_K1593997
R0010-RBS-cheZ
Used to coding a chemotactci protein, cheZ, downstream of lac promotor.
BBa_K1593211
micF-RBS-GFP
A basic part on antibiotic substance sensing-reporting system.
BBa_K1593001
COMPX
Express an outmembrane protein with a point mutation
A list of composit parts USTC iGEM 2015 have submitted to the Registry.The main functions of                             these composite parts are as following:
To improve the permeability of bacteria;
To modify the chemotaxis of bacteria;
To modify outmembrane protein;
To test the response of promtor.
