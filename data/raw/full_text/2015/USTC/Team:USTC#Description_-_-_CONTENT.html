                                bacteria or inhibiting their growth, which are implemented widespread around the
                                world. Patients who got bacterial or protozoan infection from surgical wound like war

                                so forth are able to cure treating with antibiotic substances. Since the discovery of
                                penicillin by British biologists Alexander Flaming in 1929, the antibiotic family has
                                been enlarged a lot. With properly administration of antibiotics, millions of people
                                were saved in evidently alleviated symptom. There was a time when antibiotics, along
                                with oil source for automobile, was indispensable for human beings.</P><P>Antibiotic substances containing several mechanism, rendering them to kill and inhibit

                                family of the probiotics, and this has been associated with chronic diseases.</P><P>The production of antibiotics in pharmaceutical companies explosively expanded these
                                years. Artificial synthesis of sulfonamides, quinolones and oxazolidinones enrich the

                                emergence of many antimicrobrial-resistent strains. For instance, tuberculosis(TB) in

                                owing to elevating level of antimicrobrial resistance, which raised great challenge on
                                Chinese public health. Besides, the discovery of NDM-1(New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase)

                                contribution of increasing antibiotic resistance comes from individuals' inappropriate

                                antibiotics in the river samples, its feature is also deficiency: that is such strong
                                specificity may hurt extensive measurement. Besides, using traditional genetically
                                modified circuits to express report is still time-consuming, comparing with general

                                make a larger level of antibiotic molecule detection, even a detection for other
                                chemical molecules. So, the mechanism and construction of CACCI can be divided into the

Consequently, CACCI is also established with systematic permeability reconstruction to increase its capability on molecules absoprtion.</LI><LI><STRONG>Adhesion</STRONG>: According to our modeling, we need to adhere bacteria to a surface. Theoretically, when elastic deformation--caused by the movement of the bacteria containing cheZ parts--occurred on the film, interference will be observed.
                                In order to make bacteria firmly adhere to the film, two strategies for strong adhesion are taken into consideration, which including <STRONG>electrostatic interaction using polylysine(PLL)</STRONG> and <STRONG>covalent interaction by modifying bacterial transmembrane protein</STRONG>, which is based on the principle of clickable chemistry. Polylysine containing positive charge binds to gram-negative bacteria owing to their negative outer membrane. Consequently, strong electrostatic interaction between polylysine and bacterial membrane will take place theoretically. Moreover, covalent ligation will be established between the bacteria and the film to ensure stable adhesion. In order to achieve covalently adhesion, modification on bacterial transmembrane protein is necessary.

                                Module</H4><P><STRONG>What is Chemotaxis?</STRONG></P><P>Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specific cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules. As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on the bacteria membrane, which enables the bacteria to 'sense' the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings. Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrates different behavior when the bacteria are exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to their metabolism and reproduction.</P><P>The chemotaxis mechanism in <EM>E. coli</EM> can be illustrated as following:</P><UL><LI><P>When absence of chemical, there is no molecules bind to the chemoreceptors, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP. Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagella motors making flagellum rotates clockwise. In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.</P></LI><LI><P>When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interaction, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY. Those dephosphorylated cheY cannot bind with flagella motors, and consequently, flagella rotate counter-clock which can be observed as bacteria swim smoothly. In some special situations, cheR will methylate chemoreceptors to remain the disassociation between cheA and cheW. Then, bacteria will still swim but not tumble.</P></LI></UL><P><STRONG>Genetically Engineered Chemotaxis Bacteria</STRONG></P><P>Because of lack of natural chemoreceptors for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sense antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorylation capability on cheY. The model is illustrated as following:</P><H4 id="integrative-modification-on-bacterial-permeability" class="scrollspy">Integrative Modification on Bacterial Permeability</H4><P>Our CACCI construction is systematically not only including chemotaxis modification, but containing some permeability improvement by inhibition of efflux system and overexpression of exogenous porin.

Natually, CRISPR/Cas9 system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRISPR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms. Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from <EM> Streptococcus pyogenes</EM> and other bacteria. It has been shown that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing, interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments which is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA. Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.</P><P>When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depended on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9.

Thus, polylysine would readily absorb to film we designed and gives a smooth coverage in a form of monolayer, containing tightly packed globule with average lateral dimension of 20 nm.

(Attention: the LB liquid medium should contain glycerol which is used for cryopreservation. When bacteria grow in exponential phase. Get CACCI and culture them in skim milk containing sodium chloride. And we preserve those CACCI in refrigerator at minus 80 degree celcius for about 8 hours.

He helps CACCI in three
                                aspects, which are the optical aspect, the hardware aspect and the software aspect.
                                Using Michelson Interferometer, the optical part, Spring transforms the shape change of
                                CACCI's membrane into the change of interference fringe. Spring's hardware, based on
                                Raspberry–Pi, allows spring to take photos or videos of the fringe. At last, the
                                software analyses them and transmits the results to PC. CACCI depends on Spring.</P><P>Actually, SPRING is a measurement system which is designed to detect antibiotics in

                                Hardware part and Software part. Optical part is actually Michelson Interferometer, which
                                can transform the shape change of a film into the change of interference fringe. Based
                                on a Raspberry-Pi, hardware part can take photos or videos of interference fringe, then
                                our software analyses them or transmits to your PC. Finally, we’ll see the results on

                                between mountains. Nowadays, contamination issue in river becomes more and more serious.
                                Not only excessive antibiotic emission in China, lots of other toxic heavy metal ion,
                                organic materials are found in river, which tremendously threaten public health and

                                that is related to the bacterial concentration in the system. Many gene expression is
                                naturally regulated by quorum sensing, which is also treated as social interaction in

                                other bacteria. It has been showed that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing,
                                interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to

                                complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes,

                                recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2
                                main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary
                                to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at
                                the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary
                                structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9. During engineered
                                section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to
                                take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.
