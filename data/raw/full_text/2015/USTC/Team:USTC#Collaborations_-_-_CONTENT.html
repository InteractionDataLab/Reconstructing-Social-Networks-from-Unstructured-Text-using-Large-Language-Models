In this meeting, we determined that we can cooperate in the aspects of experiment, hardware and modeling.

And they tested their softeware using Spring. After testing, their arithmetic turned out pretty quick, but they also found some disadvantages.

So the accuracy strongly depend on the lines you chose.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>

The conference included official presentations along with Q&amp;A and a poster session. This is the first time this year we got to know what other teams were doing. During the meeting, we introduced our project to all, received much valuable advice and gave much advice about other teams' work, especially the team BIT.
