                                Anhui Province in Eastern China. A prefecture-level city, it is the political, economic,
                                and cultural center of Anhui. Located in the central portion of the province.</P><P>From the 8th to the 6th century BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part
                                of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made.
                                The name Hefei was first given to the county set up in the area under the Han dynasty in
                                the 2nd century BC. During the 4th to the 6th century AD, this crucial border region
                                between northern and southern states was much fought over; its name and administrative
                                status were consequently often changed. During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907)
                                periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century,
                                when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.</P><P>Hefei plays an important role in scientific research in China. It has seven national
                                laboratories, second only to Beijing: The National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
                                (Chinese: 国家同步辐射实验室; pinyin: Guójiā tóngbù fúshè shíyàn shì), the Hefei National
