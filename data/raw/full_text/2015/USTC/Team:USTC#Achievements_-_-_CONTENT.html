                  the features of the hardware operation. Make the video available on your wiki. You
                  must also send the video file to iGEM HQ (email hq [at] igem [dot] org). <STRONG>See
                    our tutorial video in <A href="http://tower.im">Tutorial-Instructional Video</A></STRONG></LI><LI>Document your device on your wiki with information and associated files sufficient
                  for a future iGEM team to reproduce your work. You should include relevant design
                  schematics, 3d print files (or other), software and a Bill of Materials (BOM).

                  intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in
                  iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or
                  more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub
                  for more information.) <STRONG>See our Practices in <A href="http://tower.im">Policy&amp;Practices</A></STRONG></LI></UL><H4 id="Gold" class="scrollspy">Gold:</H4><P>In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your
                team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:</P><UL><LI>Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices
                  activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the
                  design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human
                  Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves
                  educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human
                  Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous
                  teams).<STRONG>See our Integrated Practices Activities in <A href="http://tower.im">Policy&amp;Practices-Integrated
                    Human Practice</A></STRONG></LI><LI>Help any other iGEM team utilize the hardware developed by your team. You must
                  clearly show how your hardware was used and the results that were obtained. Results
                  should take the form of a written report from the team testing the hardware and be
                  posted on both team's wikis.
                </LI><LI>Select a previous iGEM Hardware project from any track and demonstrate how you have
                  continued to work on the project by improving the functionality, ease of use, or
                  documentation of another facet of the work/device.
                </LI><LI>Demonstrate your hardware at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. If your equipment is too large
                  to transport, create an installation to demonstrate functionality. Note: you may not
                  bring live biological materials to the Jamboree.
