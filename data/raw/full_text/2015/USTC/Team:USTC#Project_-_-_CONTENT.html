                                Abusing antibiotics has caused severe antibiotics contamination and resistance issues worldwide. Therefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with OD detector and optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies.
                                
                                In NDM, there are two bacterial systems for measurement:

Because antibiotic substances contamination occurs in very low concentration, such as ~2000ng/L or 2ug/L that is much lower than normal contaminants concentration, accurate detection by bactiera using simple genetic circuit. Consequently, ROSE is established with both genetically amplified circuit and systematic permeability reconstruction.

                                In general, ROSE as a community, containing two kinds of bactiera, among which Bactiera I specfically receives antibiotic concentration information from <EM>antibiotic substance sensing promoters</EM>, which were previously selected by Shimshon Belkin and Sahar Melamed in 2012. Then Bacteria I output information with LuxI, part of genetic expression regulator by quorum sensing, whose information is provided with positive amplification for Bacteria II. Bacteria II itself will automatically produce another part of regulator LuxR triggered by IPTG. Besides Bacteria II has a logically amlification circuit regulated by LuxI-LuxR complex. In this circuit containing two promoter regulaing two protein. The former one is regulated by Lux complex and produces cI inhibition protein and the latter one will be inhibited by cI protein and EGFP will be expressed when lack of cI protein. Consequently, this genetic amplification circuit, compare with others, will not directly enhance the intensity of GFP expression but to increase the signal resolution of concentration variation.

                                The design intention on bactieral membrane permeability improvement is directly from part of mechanism of antibiotics resistance. Theoratically, bacteria won't receive antibiotic substance bacause of mutation of its transmembrane protein and efflux system. Thus, we are attempting to modify bactiera in reverse way, that is overexpression of transmembrane protein, or more specifically porin, and inhibition of efflux system production through CRISPR.

                                Previous research from Sahar Melamed and Shimshon Belkin has already selected dozens of promoters responding to antibiotic concentration specificallly through the fluorescence signal.

                                For instance, <EM>micF</EM> has relatively specific signal response when treated with sulfamethoxazole(255.2), sulfadimethoxine(44.9) and colistin(36.9), <EM>soxS</EM> is able to sense tetracycline(26.5) and oxytetracycline(26.1) at relative high intense. Besides, <EM>recA</EM> will effectively detect the existence of nalidixic acid and etc. These maximal induction of each promoter strain is tested in the course of 10h of exposure.

                                The mechanism of these promoters are different from each other. However, basically, mechanisms consist of: - micF, an antisense ncRNA targeting ompF RNA, main endogenous porin of <EM>Escherichia coli</EM>, participating in post-transcriptionally regulation of this outer membrane protein F(ompF). micF is also regarded as one of the promoter of soxRS-regulated gene.

                                </P><P>In the circuit, micF and SoxS won't directly reporter fluorescence signal, instead, information will deliver through quorum sensing for positive amplification.

                                Using community with different compartments would further improve the signal amplification, as known, quorum sensing is a system for stimulation(some signaling molecules called autoinducers) and response(receptor that will transcrpt certain genes) that is related to the bactieral concentration in the system. Many gene expression is naturally regualted by quorum sensing, which is also treated as social interation in bacterial community.
                                </P><P>
                                In some gram-negative bacteria, such as <EM>Vibro fischeri</EM>, biosynthesis of autoinducers is used for yield of bioluminescence through luciferase. The signaling molecule used by <EM>V. fischeri</EM> is an acylated homoserine lactone(AHL),called N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone, which can be engineered into <EM>E. coli</EM>. The signaling molecule will be produced in the cytoplasm using LuxI synthease enzyme and then secreted through the cell membrane to the extracelluar surroundings. When N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone begins diffusing back into cells or other bacteria, LuxR will recognize the existence of N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone with a threshold concentration, about 10ug/mL. Finally, target gene such as LuxlCDABE will be activated with LuxR and N-(3-oxohexanol)-homoserine lactone complex. 
                            </P><P>
                                It has been proved that LuxR has evolutionary conservation in many gram-negative bacteria, which enables <EM>E. coli</EM> to receive AHL from other bacteria. Thus we engineer Bacteria I to release quorum sensing molecules to Bacteria II for exponentailly amplified results.

                                To achieve antibiotic concentration corresponding to AHL production, AHL produced by Bacteria I will be regulated by antibiotic substance sensing promoters. And in Bacteria II, LuxR will be directly expressed regulated by lac operon, triggered by IPTG. With treatment of IPTG, LuxR will be consitutively expressed to ensure LuxR-AHL complex will intiate the expression of required genes.

                                In addition of signal amplification through quorum sensing, an artificial genetically engineered cascade magnification circuit is also implemented in ROSE construction.

                                In this cascade signal circuit, LuxR-AHL complex trigger the activation of promoter Lux, then express cI derived from λ phage. Since cI is a highly effcient repressor that is a low concentration of cI will completely repress the effiency of λ promoter. As a result, EGFP will be drastically and negatively regulated when treated with antibiotic substances.

                                It is notable that this second level amplication module won't directly expand the signal intensity, in another way, it will indirectly enlarge the resolution of different antibiotic concentration gradients. Our theoratical modeling also illustrate a higher resolution implementing this amplification circuit.

Nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to interact with the aqueous channel.

                                In <EM>E. coli</EM> different porins, for example OmpF and OmpC is expressed endogenously in different situations for different molecules. But these natural occurring porines are only permeable for molecules like sugars smaller than 600 Da. And more importantly, implement of micF, an antisense ncRNA may inhibit the material diffusion through OmpF. Therefore, it is necessary to import an exogenous porin with higher effiency of small molecular tranportation, such as OprF derived from <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</EM>.

The overexpression of OprF in <EM>E. coli</EM> will drastically improve the antibiotic absorption capability, like antibiotic condensation occured in <EM>E. coli</EM>.

SCVE is permeable for many small molecules, which is originately designed for apoptosis of cells triggered by virus.

                                According to previous research, efflux system contributes a lot for bacterial antibiotic resistance, or multidrug resistance(MDR). For example, in <EM>E. coli</EM>, AcrAB efflux system has a physiological role of pumping out many bile acids, fatty acids to lower their intracelluar toxicty. It would be an attemptation to go directly reverse to antibiotic resistance, that is to inhibit the function of efflux system. In order to completely inhibit the major efflux system of <EM>E. coli</EM> in genetic level, CRIPSR would be an impressive solution for totally deletion of the function of efflux system.

                                Clutersted reularly interspacaed short palindromic repeats, abbreviated as <EM>CRIPSR</EM>, are some fragements in prokayotic DNA with short repeats. Natually, CRISPR/Cas system is an important immune system that is able to resist the existence and reproduction of exogenous genetic materials, directly recognizing and then cut these genetic fragments, such as phages and plasmids, by CRIPSR spacers, which is quite similar to RNA interference(RNAi) discovered in eukaryotic organisms. Cas9, which is CRISPR Associated Protein 9 in brief, is an RNA-guding DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the CRISPR segments derived naturally from * Streptococcus pyogenes* and other bacteria. It has been showed that Cas9 plays an important role in memorizing, interrogating and ultimately cleaving these foreign DNA. Mechanism of cleavage is to unwind the foreign DNA and check whether there is a about 20 bp fragments that is complementary to guide RNA (gRNA, in brief). When the recognition result turns to yes, Cas9 will cleave the foreign DNA. Nowadays, with proper modification, CRIPSR/Cas9 has become a common gene editing tool, being able to cut the target gene with gRNA design.

                                When it comes to artificial design of CRISPR/Cas9 system, how to sucessfully achieve recruitment of Cas9 depends on the structure of gRNA. In general, gRNA consists of 2 main parts, the former part is about 20 bp RNA sequences, which is exactly complementary to target genes, and it will be more impressive if these complementary sequence is at the beginning of the transcrption sites of gene. And the latter part is a secondary structure part which finally forms as hairpin used to recruit Cas9. During engineered section, this structual part can directly import from iGEM parts and what we need to take care is the fragment complementary to efflux system gene.

                                Chemotaxis is a phenomenon of the movement of an organism, specifically cells or bacteria, stimulated by chemical molecules. As for bacteria, naturally, chemoreceptors were expressed on bacteria membrane, which enables bacteria to 'sense' the existence of chemical molecule concentration in the surroundings. Chemotaxis consists of two situation, including positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis, which respectively demonstrate different behaviour when exposed to surroundings with chemical molecules beneficial or harmful to bactiera metabolism and reproduction.
                            </P><P>The chemotaxis mechanism in <EM>E. coli</EM> can be illstustrated as following:</P><UL><LI><P>When absence of chemical, there is no molecule binds to chemorecptor, cheW, an intracellular protein, is associated with cheA and cheA will autophosphorylate itself and capture phosphate group from ATP. Later, phosphate will be transferred to cheY and the phosphorylated cheY associates with the flagellar motors making flagellum rotates clockwise. In general, bacteria tumble in the absence of chemical.</P></LI><LI><P>When presence of chemicals, cheA is free from cheW interation, and cheZ will efficiently remove phosphate group from cheY. Those dephosphorylated cheY cannot bind with flagellar motors, and consequently, flagellar rotats counter-clock which can be observed as bacteria swim directly. In some special situation, cheR will methylates chemoreceptors to remain the disasscoation between cheA and cheW. Then, bacteria will still swim without tumbles.</P></LI></UL><P><STRONG>Genetically Engineered Chemotaxis Bacteria</STRONG>Because of lack of natural chemoceptor for antibiotics, we need to construct a genetic circuit specifically to sensing antibiotics, and according to the mechanism of chemotaxis, we need to overexpress cheZ to improve its phosphorlation capability on cheY. The model is illstruated as following:

According to our modeling, see more in <A href="http://tower.im">Modeling-Determination of Polyer Membrane Candidate</A>, pressure caused by adhesive membrane is about 10^-4 Pa. Consequently, the wavelength of laser about 650nm is able to detect um-scale deformation and considering cm sqaured film, we need the Young's Modulus of membrane is smaller than 1GPa.

Besides, these proteins as well play an important role in the resistance against attack by human complement system.
                                 The modified COMPX structure is illustrated as below:
                                 As planned, OMPx will be mutated at residue 16, from glycine to p-Azido-L-Phenylalanine, zooming in the mutated site in orange:

                                As for optical interference, because of high frequency of light waves(about 10^14 HZ), is it impossible to detect using current detector. Instead, only the intensity of an optical interference patteren can be observed, which is proportional to the square of the average amplitude of the wave.
                                The requirements of light source should be monochromatic, which means waves have a single frequency. Generally, a laser beam, in reality, approximates more closely to a monochromatic source and its straightforward generates interference
