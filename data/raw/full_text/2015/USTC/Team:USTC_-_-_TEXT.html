Nanomachine Detecting Microbiotics
In the beginning, we extracted antibiotics, assuming it to be Perseus and it was so. Time going, we found antibiotics turned out to be Ares.
Continue
In natural environment, many antibiotic substances are emitted into river in their active state, which caused tremendously challenges on human health and environment. Thus, this year we USTC develop NDM, a hardware trying to detect those molecules and hold back this situation.  Advantages of NDM including:
Rapid
Detection won’t be based on fluorescence signal,  however a brand new way! Then, how much time does a detection assay cost? 1 day? 100 min? Answer is 100 SECONDS!
Convenient
NDM is portable for people to operate it, and we developed a friendly GUI for better experience. Moreover, we will package bacteria into powder for iGEMers!
Compatible
NDM is compatible for everyone to engineer. We hope genetic modification on device level would expand.  After all, ‘M’ in NDM means much more than microbiotics!
Constitutions of NDM
CACCI
Programmed bacteria to detect chemicals whatever you want
Film
Change the movement of bacterial to deformation of film.
SPRING
The main body NDM, platform provided for experiment.
Optical path
Detect the deformation by Michelson Interference.
GUI
Provide a better experience for users.
