All experiments, presentations, results and constructs in the project NDM is originally                                 and independently designed and conducted by students in USTC iGEM team in School of Life                                 Sciences of Univeristy of Science and Technology of China(USTC). Instructors of USTC                                 provided some advice and suggestion on project.
