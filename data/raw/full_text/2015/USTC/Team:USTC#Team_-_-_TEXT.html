A: Captain, that's enough!
Q: Where do you think the human's limit?
A: Perhaps the human limit is "out of control", it is an abstract? Think of the Turing                                 test, you can not know in the end is a man or a black box in artificial intelligence;                                 highly developed biotechnology lead to the natural order into the chaos; the man himself                                 does not destroy the environment already exist easiest technique to repair ......                                 speaking, the endless desire for expansion, It will squeeze the survival of mankind                                 until suffocation. If development is under control, I believe that human beings can go                                 all the way, but runaway start, mean the end of humanity.
Yang Han
Q:How do you feel about owning so many fans? What do they call you? Han Shen, right? I                                 suppose you must be very proud to be recgnized as a Shen, god in Chinese.
A:Well, the truth is, being a Shen sometimes is very tiring. You need to keep elegant                                 all the time. But yes, of course I feel so proud.
Q:Do you still often see the beautiful stars in sky?
A: Before myopia I often watched them, at present I can only see the moon.

Q: If science is in your front with numerous difficulties and obstacles, will you stick                                 to your dream and go on?
A: I still cannot forget the moment when I finally found my dream. How precious I found                                 that I won't give up easily! Moreover for me, compared to the numerous difficulties and                                 obstacles, the life without dream and filled with dark, despair is much more terrible.

Hefei City
Hefei formerly known as Hofei, Luzhou, or Luchow, is the capital and largest city of                                 Anhui Province in Eastern China. A prefecture-level city, it is the political, economic,                                 and cultural center of Anhui. Located in the central portion of the province.
From the 8th to the 6th century BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part                                 of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made.                                 The name Hefei was first given to the county set up in the area under the Han dynasty in                                 the 2nd century BC. During the 4th to the 6th century AD, this crucial border region                                 between northern and southern states was much fought over; its name and administrative                                 status were consequently often changed. During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907)                                 periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century,                                 when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.
Hefei plays an important role in scientific research in China. It has seven national                                 laboratories, second only to Beijing: The National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Chinese: 国家同步辐射实验室; pinyin: Guójiā tóngbù fúshè shíyàn shì), the Hefei National                                 Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale (Chinese: 微尺度物质科学国家实验室; pinyin: Wēi                                 chǐdù wùzhí kēxué guójiā shíyàn shì), both of which are under the University of Science                                 and Technology of China. It also has the Institute of Solid State Physics, Institute of                                 Plasma Physics, Institute of Intelligent Machines, High Magnetic Field Laboratory                                 (founded in 2008), Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, all of which are under                                 the Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences which belongs to the Chinese Academy of                                 Sciences.Hefei is the location of EAST, an experimental superconducting tokamak magnetic                                 fusion energy reactor.
