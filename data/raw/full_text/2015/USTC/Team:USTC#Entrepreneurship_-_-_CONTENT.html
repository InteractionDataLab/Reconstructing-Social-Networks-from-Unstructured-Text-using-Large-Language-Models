In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're removing the track and introducing an <B>award</B> for entrepreneurship.
</P><DIV class="highlightBox"><H4>Note</H4><P>In order to be considered for the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes">Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award</A>, you must fill out this page.</P></DIV><P>The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did. As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges! </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
