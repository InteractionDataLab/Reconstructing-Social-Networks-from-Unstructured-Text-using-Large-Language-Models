Project Description
    Phytophthora infestans is the causal agent of late blight disease of several members from the Solanaceae family. Potato, the third most important food crop in the world and one of the sources of major agricultural income in many countries, easily falls victim to P. infestans when temperature and moisture is suitable. Yet most existing biological control methods are ineffective and may even have further negative effects. This year, the NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates a new systematic way to fight against potato late blight. We have characterized a new defensin in order to block the nutrient absorption and further growth of the oomycete. Inspired by competitive inhibition in pharmacology, we designed and improved a ligand with higher affinity aiding the entrance of P. infestans avirulence protein. To detect whether the potato is susceptible to late blight, we devised a soil-based microbial fuel cell (MFC) detecting salicylic acid emission and producing oscillating current. In our project design, we strive to cover every aspect that can prevent, fight against, and detect potato late blight. Furthermore, we will provide a standard procedure that can easily be followed by anyone without advanced knowledge in biology.
