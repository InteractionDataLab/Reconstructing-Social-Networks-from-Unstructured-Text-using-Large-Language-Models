Acknowledgements
All the work, including experiments, team wiki construction, modeling, and human practice, were done by the students in our team. Instructors and our advisors helped us with brainstorming, checking and confirming part sequences and function, offering suggestions on modeling methods, providing support in policy and practices and public outreach, and so on. Yet we would also like to express special thanks to those who offered us assistance along the way: The background image of wiki was provided by a friend of one of our team members. The sponsors and other institutions that have helped us are listed on the footer of our wiki page. General support
Dr. Chuan-Hsiung Chang, Dr. Ching-Fen Chang and Mr. Jude Clapper are the mentors of our team. They guided us along the way throughout preparation, lecture learning and brainstorming and always encouraged us to think out of the box and to view things from different perspectives.
Dr. Ching-Fen Chang is in charge of wet lab training for iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we might cause her trouble sometimes, she is still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments in the lab. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care.
Dr. You-Yin Chen helped us construct the wireless sensor and gave us important advice about our functional prototype, the soil based microbial fuel cell
Jesse Wu taught us a lot, such as biobricking, creating Media wiki, paper research, etc during lecture. He is a really nice person, and has patience to help us solve different problems with machine and computer software. The knowledge he taught us is very useful. He is our great teacher and is always willing to answer our questions. With his help, our project is made much more special!
Chih-Hsien Yang also taught us modeling, and guide us to use Octave to present our experimental results. We are also very grateful to him!
