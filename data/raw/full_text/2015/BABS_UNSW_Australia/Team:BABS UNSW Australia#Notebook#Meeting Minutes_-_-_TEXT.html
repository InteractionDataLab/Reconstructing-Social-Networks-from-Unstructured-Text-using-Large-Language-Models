Meeting Minutes
Lets face it, to keep a project this big on track communication is key. From the lab to a sushi restaurant we met far and wide discussing everything from what we had for breakfast to the craziest of project ideas. Documented here are the summaries of these encounters, make of them what you will. At the very least we hope they give you an insight into the inner workings of our team.

Context
The meeting took place at the Japanese restaurant Mizuya on George St. The aim was to get everyone together before the boot camp in February to discuss potential projects, supervisors and group member’s areas of interest.
Lab/software Project
What professors could we target to assist us with the project? Marc Wilkins seems like the most likely candidate at the moment, Daniel will discuss with him where the project currently stands and what we might be looking for in a supervisor. In regards to choosing one it is important to first get a good idea of the actual project (still unknown). Belinda Ferrari and Andrew Brown were also suggested.
Revisited potential projects including;
Vesicles in E.coli, perhaps as means of capturing pure protein samples
PTM’s
A device for the Defence forces regarding a microbiome tracking + kill switch???
Incorporating logic gates
Protein-Protein interactions. Discussed a lot of different possibilities including things to do with the histone code and part-part enzyme assembly
“Everlab” seems to be promising, using Evernote API to link lab documentation to a simple software that allows you to design diagrams for biobricks, plasmids etc.
Outreach
Ideas included pop-up stalls, school visits, Youtube series (skits, what do real scientists do?, dramatisation?) and involving anthropology.
An important realisation was the discrepancy between what laypeople and we may think is funny or interesting. It is important we keep this in mind when we design our outreach program
Organisation/collaboration
The use of Google drive and face book has been sufficient for our needs to date. Evernote also seems to be the ideal program to use for our lab documentation; we will look to set this up soon.
To do list
Read, read and read some more. Daniel will put some more papers on Google drive regarding PPI and PTM’s
Everyone is to come up with an idea for a project and flesh out the key steps. This must be done before the boot camp.
