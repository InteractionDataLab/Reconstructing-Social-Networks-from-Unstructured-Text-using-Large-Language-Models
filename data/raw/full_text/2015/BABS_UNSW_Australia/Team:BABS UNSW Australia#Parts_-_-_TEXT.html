Lactoccocus Parts
BBa_K1677103: Invasin with LysM signal peptide (Lactococcus)
This protein-coding part encodes invasin tailored for use in Lactococcus species.The signal peptide region of Listeria monocytogenes was exchanged for a signal peptide from Lactobacillus plantarum. The aim of this is localise the invasin protein to the outer membrane when used in Lactococcus species. The LysM (lysine motif) protein domain embeds itself in the membrane, presenting the attached protein to the extracellular environment. The invasin gene was codon-optimised for expression in L. lactis
BBa_K1677101: Listeriolysin (Lactococcus)
This part is listeriolysin codon-optimised for expression in Lactococcus. By co-expressing with the above LysM-INV, Lactococcus species can enter into mammalian cells.
Pseudoknots
BBa_K1677391: IBV Pseudoknot
Sequence adapted from a pseudoknot sourced from the Infection Bronchitis Virus.
BBa_K1677369: MMTV Pseudoknot
Sequence adapted from a pseudoknot sourced from the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus.
BBa_K1677743: TGV Pseudoknot
Sequence adapted from a pseudoknot sourced from the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus.
The above pseudoknots were submitted individually, for future use as translational regulatory mechanisms.
IPTG-inducible promoter + Pseudoknots
BBa_K1677800: IPTG inducible promoter with IBV pseudoknot
BBa_K1677801: IPTG inducible promoter with TGV pseudoknot
BBa_K1677802: IPTG inducible promoter with MMTV pseudoknot
The above three parts are composite biobricks composed of a promoter inducible by IPTG (BBa_J04500) followed by one pseudoknot. This device allows expression of a gene with a translational delay post-induction.
pH promoters
BBa_K1677300: Lactococcus lactis p170 promoter
This promoter has enhanced activity under low pH.
