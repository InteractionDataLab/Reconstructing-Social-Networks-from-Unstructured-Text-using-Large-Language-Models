Meeting Minutes
Lets face it, to keep a project this big on track communication is key. From the lab to a sushi restaurant we met far and wide discussing everything from what we had for breakfast to the craziest of project ideas. Documented here are the summaries of these encounters, make of them what you will. At the very least we hope they give you an insight into the inner workings of our team.
