Biosafety has been one of the major paradigms of project endosynbio. Our use of virulence factors and RG2 organisms, as well as the pathogenic nature of our engineered bacteria and the fact that this is our university’s first time at iGEM, has meant our intrinsic project design, protocol design and wet lab have been managed with extra regard for safety. See below for our final Safety Forms.
Something which has struck our team on this journey, however, has been the lack of regulation and guidelines, especially in Australia, regarding unforeseen consequences in synthetic biology. We believe a shift in the philosophy of bacterial genetic engineering could really help to improve this and as such, have explored this as a human practices endeavour. Please see our detailed report under the human practices menu, “Transforming biosafety: a new philosophy in synthetic biology.”

How will your project work?
Our modified bacteria will be able to invade mammalian host cells using an IPTG and low pH driven invasin/listeriolysin O system (and in future work,     hopefully be maintained at a stable population using AHL signalling systems). Our plasmid design ensures the invasive genes are de-activated once this     invasion has occurred successfully, using delayed-timer pseudoknots and Cre recombination. A safety-switch system, maintained on two plasmids and     integrated with the invasion system, will ensure no bacteria which leave the lab remain invasive and prevents horizontal gene transfer. This system is     designed to pave the way for stable 'synthetic organelles' to be developed, with a medical application in mind.
Laboratory Risks
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our project raises significant biosafety risks, as we are essentially generating novel pathogenic bacterial strains. In recognition of this, we assessed     and managed our project laboratory risks using the Hierarchy of Hazard Control. The Hierarchy consists of five methods for hazard reduction beginning with     the most effective, elimination, to the least effective, personal protective equipment. By using this system, risks can be managed appropriately. Some key     examples of our risk management actions are illustrated below, as they were dealt with:
ELIMINATION
Many of our parts come from RG2 organisms, some of which are human pathogens. Instead of directly handling these organisms, we chose to order parts to be     shipped from the Registry of Standard Parts or to be synthesised in the form of gBLOCKs from IDT. Thus this potential hazard was eliminated.
SUBSTITUTION
When ordered from the registry, we received an agar stab wherein invasin and lysteriolysin O were being constitutively expressed. This was extremely concerning to our team. Thus, the constitutive promoter was removed and replaced in all of our invasive constructs by the inducible IPTG promoter.
ENGINEERING CONTROLS
Within a PC1 lab, a Class II biosafety cabinet was used for all bacterial work both to protect our work from contamination and to protect ourselves, and     other laboratory users, from the invasive bacteria. A timer was installed near the cabinet to ensure UV decontamination occurred for at least 20 minutes     following a wipe-down with 70% ethanol. Periodically, the efficacy of the hood was checked by resting an uncovered nutrient agar plate inside the cabinet,     before incubation overnight at 37 degrees.
All mammalian cell culture work occurred in a PC1 lab within a tissue culture hood.
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS
All team members completed Workplace Health and Safety, Ergonomics, Laboratory Safety and Green (environmental awareness) Laboratory courses to update     basic safety knowledge. We were inducted into all laboratories and common equipment rooms. All reagents were labelled appropriately as either HAZARDOUS or     NON-HAZARDOUS and briefed with safety information, the date and the owner. A computer was established within the laboratory with access to a copy of the     laboratory safety manual, chemical inventory lists, biological inventory lists, safe working practices (SWPs) and risk assessments. Materials safety data     sheets were also directly accessible.
We are also researching and composing a report into the efficacy of current biosafety regulations, given the rapidly changing field and the lack of     philosophical discussion regarding what it means to create a novel, persisting strain of bacteria. This work meant our team was in a safe, positive     headspace regarding project decisions.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Gloves and laboratory gowns were worn by all team members when in the lab.
Real World Applications
How would your project be used in the real world?
Our project is in the first instance foundational. Much more research is required to optimise and ensure the safety and durability of this system. However,     our long-term vision is to see these synthetic organelles be used in the human body. With the rise of organogenesis, this may be possible in the near     future.
Product Risks
What risks would your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce         those risks?
The main risk would be the organisms becoming uncontrolled and invading non-target cells. Future work would require adding invasion specificity and     extensive testing of how well the toxin/anti-toxin system functions. Another risk could be horizontal gene transfer of the toxin plasmid, causing damage to     normal cells. We recognise that this kind of technology would be very difficult to trial in vivo.
