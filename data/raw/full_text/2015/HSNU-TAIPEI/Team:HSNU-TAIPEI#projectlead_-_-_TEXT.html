Introduction
Why do we detect Lead?
There are two possible reasons that lead were found in recycled oil. One is that the animal feed oil is made from animal’s internal organs, and those organs are to conduct metabolism in animal’s bodies, so they may contain little lead. The other is that the oil container is made of metals like lead, and it may dissolve lead into the oil. There’s lead in recycled oil.[1] Human body can hardly merabolize and degrade lead. To the human body, lead is a chronic and cumulative poison; it may easily lead to poisoning or even carcinogenic. Therefore, we decided to detect lead.
The harm of Lead
Lead can cause several unwanted effects, such as:
Disruption of the biosynthesis of haemoglobin and anaemia
A rise in blood pressure
Kidney damage
Miscarriages and subtle abortions
Disruption of nervous systems
Brain damage
Declined fertility of men through sperm damage
Diminished learning abilities of children
Behavioural disruptions of children, such as aggression, impulsive behavior and hyperactivity
Lead can enter a foetus through the placenta of the mother. Because of this it can cause serious damage to the nervous system and the brains of unborn children.[2]
Taiwanese regulation
The maximum allowance of lead in edible oil is 0.1 ppm.[3]
Circuit Design
We mainly divide the whole experiment into 2 major parts.
▲Fig1-1:Circuit design of detecting Lead ion.
The former fragment can consistently produce PbRr.[4]
▲Fig1-2:Circuit design of detecting Lead ion.
If the oil contains lead ions, they can integrate with proteins PbRr to further activate proteins.
▲Fig1-3:Circuit design of detecting Lead ion.
As for the later fragment, the lead promoter can be controlled by activated protein PbRr to further trigger the GFP.
Result
Whether lead can enter e.coli or not
Method
Detection of the amount of toxins in the e.coli.
Add 100μl of DH5α and 900μl of LB broth into the tube and incubate for 1hr.
Centrifuge at 4000rpm for 3min and clicard 800μl of the supernatant
Plate each 100μl of the bacteria onto the dishes and spread.
Incubate the plates at 37℃ overnight
Prepare each concentration of the toxin.
Statutory standards *100 / *10 / *1 / *0.1 / *0.01
Next day
Prepare 16 microcentrifuge tubes.(5 kinds of concentration *3 timings+control)
Add 500μl of DH5α to each tube.
Centrifuge all tubes at 4000rpm for 3min.
Remove the supernatent.
Add 1000μl of the toxic solution each time.
Follow the concentration and 3 timings(0.5hr / 1hr / 1.5hr).
Add 0.5cc of ddH2O and mix with the bacterias
Centrifuge at 13000rpm for 30 sec
Remove the water
Repeat step1~step3 for three times
Add 1cc of ddH2O and mix with the bacterias
Centrifuge at 13000rpm for 30sec.
Remove 700μl of the supernatant
Kill the bacteria:
Put all the tubes in the Liquid nitrogen
When they freeze,heat them at 100℃
Repeat step1~step2 for 3 times
Result
We put all the result into fluorescent reader.
By using gold nanoparticles(AU-NPs), we measured the lead absorption of e.coli. The higher fluorescence intensity it shows, the less lead enters e.coli.
▲Fig.2:The Pb absorption of E.coli in 1 ppm Pb2+ in different timings.
With this figure, we can know that the longer e.coli put in 1 ppm Pb2+ , the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.3:The Pb absorption of E.coli in 0.1 ppm Pb2+ in different timings.
With this figure, we can know that the longer e.coli put in 0.1 ppm Pb2+ , the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.4: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 0.01 ppm Pb2+ in different timings.
With this figure, we can know that the longer e.coli put in 0.01 ppm Pb2+ , the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.5: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 0.001 ppm Pb2+ in different timings.
With this figure, we can know that the longer e.coli put in 0.001 ppm Pb2+ , the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig:6: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 0.0001 ppm Pb2+ in different timings.
With this figure, we can know that the longer e.coli put in 0.0001 ppm Pb2+ , the more lead entered the e.coli
▲Fig.7: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 0.5hr in different Pb2+ concentration.
With this figure, we can know that the higher Pb2+ concentration in 0.5 hr, the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.8: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 1hr in different Pb2+ concentration.
With this figure, we can know that the higher Pb2+ concentration in 1 hr, the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.9: The Pb absorption of E.coli in 1.5hr in different Pb2 concentration.
With this figure, we can know that the higher Pb2+ concentration in 1.5 hr, the more lead entered the e.coli.
▲Fig.10: Checking-measuring curve of Pb.
With this figure,we can know Pb concentration is in the solution.
