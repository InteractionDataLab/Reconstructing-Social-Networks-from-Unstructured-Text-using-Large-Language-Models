In “75 Restaurant”
We have always been eager to know the indeed feelings of food vendors, but what we receive is always a cold rejection. By chance we found an enthusiastic restaurant owner, who is willing to give interviews. During the interview, he shared his thoughts with us generously and also gave us many advices, expecting that we can improve more. The tiny success this time gave us more motive force to go forward, and we hope that we can arouse other vendors’ resonance by realizing our idea.
