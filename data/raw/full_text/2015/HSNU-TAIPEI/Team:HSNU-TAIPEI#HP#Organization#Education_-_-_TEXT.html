Overview
Synthetic biology is widely applied in every aspect of life, and this is why we think each age group should have some degree of understanding in this area. We consider to call for senior high students to form a senior high school league to solve the problem in the future. We also went to seven junior high schools even in Singapore to share the same ideas. More different is that we even been to elementary school and kindergarten. We produced two app games for them because we want them to use an easy way to know the synthetic biology is a amazing subject.
