Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
All members of HSNU-Taipei team completed the registration for iGEM,and we had a great summer. 17 of members will the 2015 Giant Jamboree. ( See our labnotes )
Complete the Judging form and all required consent forms.
We have complete our Judging form, and all of our members have sent the consent forms to the iGEM headquater. ( See our Judging Form )
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We create and share a Description of our project using the iGEM wiki.The description can be seen on the home page of our team wiki.We have documented all of the parts using the Registry of Standard Diological Parts. ( See our parts )
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have prepared a poster.  Seventeen of our members who will attend the iGEM Jamboree will be in charge of presenting the poster and deliver a talk at the gathering of iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We have created an attribution page . It illustrates our research work and distinguishes our work from the professional supports that we gained from other institutions.  We also clearly describe the contribution for each individual in these institutions.
Collaborate with another team or become a mentee for any iGEM team that has previously participated in the iGEM competition and is attending the 2015 Jamboree.
We collaborate with several schools.
1. We had meeting with NYMU-Taipei every Thursday night.
2. We consult with NYMU-Taipei and NCTU_Formosa for the information and technique.
3. NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan share experimental experience with us. Also, sharing plasmid BBa_B0015 and restriction enzymes.
4. We interflowed with Mingdao. We exchanged our ideas.
5. NJAU_China shared their experimental experience in part BBa_K1555000 with us.

Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We have documented 25 new standard BioBrick Parts and submitted 7 parts to the iGEM Registry. ( See our parts )
Document the characterization of an existing part in the 'Main Page' section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. This part can come from the 2015 Distribution, or you can order a part from the Registry.
All of our parts are documented on the Main page of our wiki pages "part". ( See our parts )
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
One of our advisor, Dr. Tsai at National Yang-Ming University(NYMU) work together with us.  She is a professor in the institute of health and welfare policy.  We had a few meetings in framing our human practice part.  Professor Chang at NYMU also gave us great suggestions on human practice part.  We think our project is involved with two parts: food safety and synthetic biology.  Thus, we think we should devote efforts on understanding the social justice, security and social impact related to the food safety part.  In terms of synthetic biology, we need to know related professional knowledge, such as intellectual property rights, safety and popularity of this new technique.  We first identified three dimensions of the human practice:
(1)technology/profession: to understand the technique that we design can be used and successfully applied by the public
(2)education/communication: to promote the synthetic biology in iGEM project, and also receive feedbacks and comments from the society
(3)social impact: to investigate relate issues in food safety in Taiwan.

Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities).
As we defined three dimension for our Human practice, we quickly list the work for each dimension:  (1)technology/profession: to understand the technique that we design can be used and successfully applied by the public.  We need to collect professional comments from professors, food suppliers, bio-tech industry and the public.   (2)education/communication: to promote the synthetic biology in iGEM project, and also receive feedbacks and comments from the society.  We decided that our human practice part should serve the role of education and communication.  Thus, we need to visit schools of different levels and the public.   (3)social impact: to investigate relate issues in food safety in Taiwan. We should  comprehend it from a macro view, not only being upset consumers and complaining about the government.  Dr. Tsai believed we should target understanding the policy design because many issues (ethics, social justice, safety, security, culture, budget constraints) have to be considered in policy development.  Thus, we decided to investigate related policies, how the government implements the policies, and the effectiveness of the policies.  Also she believed that we should approach and examining these issues from different sectors, not only listening to the governmental officers.
To make sure the system will work out well, we visited (1)executive departments, (2)legislative departments and lawyers, (3)non-governmental organization, (4)industry, and (5)vendors, (6) school.  We are very proud of work in education.  We visited many schools across every age group, teacher's inter-district communities, senior high schools, junior high, elementary schools and kindergarten. We produced two game apps which are free on Google Play Store, named Gene Check and Gene Maker. ( See our Human Practice )
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Silver medal criterion #1.
We have documented 25 new standard BioBrick Parts and submitted 7 parts to the iGEM Registry. ( See our parts )
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
We designed a product which contains E. coli with the gene fragments to detect toxins. We embed E.coli into microcapsules. We have a biological safety system. The embedding of E. coli saves cost and time and has high-efficiency detection mechanisms. Our experiment results indicated that immobilizing E. coli can successfully detect toxins. Besides, our work on biosafety issue is to reduce the risk that the E-coli will leak out and contaminate the environment. We have developed triple biosafety certificated mechanisms that will reduce the risk. We developed our product which has been successfully experimental test of feasibility. For example, 4ppm copper ion can induce the microcapsule glow within five minutes. ( See our product )
