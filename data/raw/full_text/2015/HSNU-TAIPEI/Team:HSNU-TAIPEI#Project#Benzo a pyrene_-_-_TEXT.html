 Benzo[a]pyrene
 ✡ Introduction
   (1)Why do we detect benzo[a]pyrene?
   Because when food,such as fried food ,which is heated above 300 degrees
   celcius,food will release benzo[a]pyrene recycled oil usually contain
   benzo[a]pyrene[1].
   (2)Harm?
   Pathway:from skin,breathing in,eating Carcinogenic,environmental
   pollution, Skin irritation,eye irritation[1].
   (3)Taiwanese regulation
[2]
   (4)National regulation
   Europe:The same to Taiwanese regulation[2]
   American:The MCL has been set at 0.2 ppb[3]
 ✡ Circuit Design
   So far,we don’t find the protein which can combine with the Benzo[a]pyrene,so first
   we must degradate it by Laccase. And its product is Bap-1,6-quinone which can
   combine with the protein,in order that we can detect Benzo[a]pyrene. [4]
   We put the gene fragment which can produce the Laccase in the E.coli
   Let it produce itself.
   QsrR is a protein which can combine with Bap-1,6-quinone.[5]As Laccase,we put the
   gene fragment in the E.coli.Let it produce itself.
   We design a gene part make QsrR repress sfRFP’s production.
   Usually,QsrR is on the Binding Site,and red fluorescent protein will not be produced.
   When QsrR combine with Bap-1,6-quinone, QsrR will be activated and go away.
   And the transcription will carry on,then it will produce red fluorescent protein
