Introduction
To truly solve the food scandal and even prevent it from happening again, besides create a revolutionary bio-sensor to popularize the toxic detection, we also meet up members from legislative yuan in taiwan. In the meeting, there are several main purposes:
To know the change of law after the food scandal happened and how it prevent the food scandal from happening again.
Knowing how those members from legislative yuan strike a balance between taiwan public and food industry.
Can law been adjusted to be more flexible on bio-sensor for toxic detection in order to make our product more convenient.
About our project: Feasibility, advantages, disadvantage, etc.
Meeting highlights
To the law we are using now are for punishing those profit oriented producer only if that was found out their product was made from inferior materials. In order to prevent food scandal from happening again, the fine for producing toxic-containing food is continuously raised by government and sharply increased in recent days, but, just like laws for preventing drunk driving, the lawmaker mentioned, no matter how high the fine is for doing so, drunk driving still happens all the time. Therefore, for situation now, raising fine really does not help much.
For taiwan, the thing we really need to prevent food scandals from happening is comprehensive detection. A detecting system that can be popularized into every homes so that people can also take part in food detection, meanwhile, every thing that people put in their mouth can be tested so the tainted products will be found before eaten.
Those lawmakers really appreciate our project.
