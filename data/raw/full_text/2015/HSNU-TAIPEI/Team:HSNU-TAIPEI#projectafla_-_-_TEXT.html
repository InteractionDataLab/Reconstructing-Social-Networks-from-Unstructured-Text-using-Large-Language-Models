ProjectAflatoxin
Introduction
Why do we detect Aflatoxin?
Gutter oil contains aflatoxin which is very toxic and will accumulate in people’s liver and kidney.
In Taiwan, there are many people who are the asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B, therefore if they be poisoned oil again, it will be easier for them to get liver disease or resulting in kidney dialysis.
In our experiment, we try to detect Afb1 because it is the most toxic of aflatoxin. Our experiment was to find out more convenient detection method, so that everyone can easily detect their own oil if it is safe to eat.
Taiwanese regulations
▼Table1: The regulation of Aflatoxin in Taiwan..
National regulations
groundnuts, nuts, dried fruit and processed products of such products or food additives: B1 aflatoxin not exceed 2ug / kg (ppb), and B1, B2, G1, G2 sum not exceeding 4ug / kg.
for the storage or not for direct human consumption's peanuts: B1 aflatoxin 8ug / kg, and B1, B2, G1, G2 sum shall not exceed 15ug / kg.
for the storage or not for direct human consumption's nuts and dried fruits: B1 aflatoxin 5ug / kg, and B1, B2, G1, G2 sum shall not exceed 10ug / kg.
Grains class for the direct human consumption: B1 aflatoxin 2ug / kg, or B1, B2, G1, G2 sum not exceeding 4ug / kg.
Dairy: M1 aflatoxin not exceed 0.05 ug / kg.[4]
Circuit Design
▲Fig.1-1: Circuit design of detecting Lead ion.
When aflatoxin goes into the cell, CYP1A2 will oxidize the Aflatoxin B1, and then it will turn into Aflatoxin oxidation AFBO[5].
▲Fig.1-2: Circuit design of detecting Lead ion.
Single-strand DNA(ssDNA) can activate protein RecA. Ecoli has a sos response system, and there is a repressor LexA which inhibits the next reaction, so the fluorescent gene won’t express.But when the activated protein RecA comes and hydrolysis the represser LexA, the next reaction can work.[7]
