Asian Conference
Introduction
We are a bunch of teenagers who have profound dreams. When facing the recent food safety issues in Taiwan, we will never allow such problems  from happening again. We will think of some biological engineering ways to ease all the unstableness. Cooperating with 6 univeristies and 11 laboratories, we wish to proclaim our philosophies and achievements while presenting and exchanging ideas during the Asian Confernece, letting people to eventually know our profound dreams and carefully listen to our inner voices.
