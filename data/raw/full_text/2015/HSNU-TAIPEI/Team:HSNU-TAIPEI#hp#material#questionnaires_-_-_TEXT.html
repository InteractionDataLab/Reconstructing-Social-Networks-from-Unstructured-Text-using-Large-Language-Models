 Introduction
                                          The topic of our project is to detect recycled oil by using synthetic biology. We made two kinds  
                                          of questionnaires
                                          and sent them out to elementry school, junior high school, senior high school students and the
                                          public. We hope that we can achieve three goals:
                                          ✔ To investigate how well people know about synthetic biology.
                                          ✔ To investigate how well people know about iGEM.
                                          ✔ To know what people think of our project and our idea.
                                          By reading the responses, we could know everyone’s thinking and improve on our project. We
                                          hope that our team can do better and better.

Conclusion
                                                               ✔ Elementary school
                                                               From the elementary school questionnaire responses, we can find out that the kids really like the way that we promote
                                                               our project which is acting and playing our app. They learned a lot of synthetic biology concepts by this activity. Many
                                                               people also drew pictures to show their gratitude. This means that our promotion is very success!
                                                               ✔ Junior high school, senior high school and the public
                                                               The three different types of participants gave out similar responses. After our promotion, most people are more
                                                               interested in iGEM competition and also know much more about synthetic biology than before. About our project, most
                                                               people approve of it and they think what we have done can do much contribute to Taiwan society. About the cost of the
                                                               recycled oil detector, junior high school students and the public think that lower cost (100-200 NT dollars) is better while
                                                              the high school students think that higher cost (more than 300 NT dollars) is better. Besides some suggestions and
                                                              questions to our project or our promoting way, many people wrote some blessings in the responses. After reading them,
                                                              we are really happy to know that many people support our idea and although we may have some problems when doing
                                                              this project, we will still complete our dream bravely.
