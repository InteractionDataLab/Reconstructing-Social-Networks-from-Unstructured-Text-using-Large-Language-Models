about our school
HSNU, located on the island of Taiwan, is the home of more than 3000 students. We claim to be the sons of the blue sky, because we have the city’s largest high school campus, also the largest slice of the blue sky. In such environment, students can do their favorite things, such as reading, club activities and sports. As we are now participating in IGEM, We collaborate, have discussing, and learn with each other. In addition to textbook knowledge, we are also able to develop our own expertise, which is what’s so special about HSNU.
