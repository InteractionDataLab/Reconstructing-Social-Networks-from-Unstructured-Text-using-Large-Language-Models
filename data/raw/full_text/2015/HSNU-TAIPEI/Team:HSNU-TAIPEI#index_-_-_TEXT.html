About the Project
Our goal is to detect recycled oil. There are several substances like Aflatoxin, Benzo[a]pyrene, heavy metals, which are exist in recycled oil. We want to make it easy, convenience for people to detect whether the food is safe. But not with large, heavy machines and wasting several days for detection.
