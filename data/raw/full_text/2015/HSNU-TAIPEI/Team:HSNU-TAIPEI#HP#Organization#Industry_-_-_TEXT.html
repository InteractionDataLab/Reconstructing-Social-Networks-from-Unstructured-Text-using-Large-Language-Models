Overview
We interviewed the basic of the society, the vendors. By interviewing them, we knew that the cost of testing oil is too high so that many vendors in Taiwan can't afford it. And we also visited some food companies to know the effect of the food scandals. We also visited some commercial companies to promote the philosophy of our project. Let more people know this subject. Last, in order to know whether the final product can be popularized to each person, we visited the biotech companies to look for some advices.
