Introduction
After visiting elementary schools, we started to visit senior high schools.  At senior high schools, we met the students with same or similar age and have the similar goals and targets.  In different senior schools, we planned to organize a senior school’s group to find and solve the problems occurred in our society with our enthusiasm.

Review of the hole promotions
We promoted and transformed our idea and concept with our passion that delivered our idea to solve the problems.  During the visit and discussion, we found senior high schools’ students have wider knowledge and experiences v.s. the students at elementary schools and junior high schools.  So we got more suggestions of product design and experiments from the collection of questionnaires.  This is the first senior high school we visited, we got support and recognition which gave us more confidence.
