Introduction
With the experienced visits of Tamshui Junior High School and Hua Xing High School, we have confidence to promote our concept to different age.  So we visit Xing Long Elementary school, to promote IGEM in elementary schools.  By means of the opportunity, we want to introduce the basic knowledge of synthetic biology to the little boys and girls.  We want to contribute to the society and make the society progress and influence more and more people to work together.

Review of the hole promotions
The activity is very successful.  First of all we want to thanks teachers of class 303 & 403.  And most important is the studentsâ€™ passion.  No matter from the opening, introduction of ssynthetic biology to APP game, the students are very open minded and reacted with us.  When we ask questions, students response aggressively.  The students also ask very cute questions and have fun, their sweet and innocent give us warming.  We find the students enjoy and interact with us happily.  We have more confidence to continue.
