We consider to call for senior high students to form a senior high school league to solve the problem in the future. We also went to seven junior high schools even in Singapore to share the same ideas. More different is that we even been to elementary school and kindergarten. We produced two app games for them because we want them to use an easy way to know the synthetic biology is a amazing subject.</P><P>The place we visited: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/education/teacher" style="color:#00DB00">Teacher</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/education/seniorhigh" style="color:#00DB00">Senior High</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/education/juniorhigh" style="color:#00DB00">Junior High</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/education/elementary" style="color:#00DB00">Elementary</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/education/kindergarten" style="color:#00DB00">Kindergarten</A></P></FIGURE><FIGURE><H4 class="article-subtitle">Government</H4><P>Current governmental procedures of inspecting edible oil are time, money, and labor consuming. Even raising fines and aggravating punishments cannot efficiently prevent tainted oil from producing. As a result, we think of devising low cost ecoli biosensors to establish a new way for delating such offences, making governments have concrete evidences to trace and also enhancing the overall efficiency. However, because the uses of Ecoli have specific regulations in Taiwan laws, we have to ask for advice from people who have different specializations in their own professions such as deputy director, alderman, legislator, lawyer and so on…When actually executing the job of inspecting, we find out that there are many things that are harder to solve than we think. Standards existed in human societies cannot be changed easily or else changing them will result in disastrous consequences. From those people’s pratical and professional perspectives, we have better understandings about how to change our project to make it better fit the social situation.</P><P>The place we visited: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/government/legislators" style="color:#00DB00">Legislators</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/government/mohaw" style="color:#00DB00">Ministry of Health and Welfare</A></P></FIGURE><FIGURE><H4 class="article-subtitle">NGO</H4><P>We visited John Tung Foundation which is famous in Taiwan. They contributed to food safety and tobacco hazards prevention very much. Through understanding their working process: striving for approval, lawmaking and promotion which resemble with our human practice, we exchanged our thoughts with them to help us grow up. They have a different opinion with us about our project. They thought we can not only give the consumers biosensors but also give them to the producers. If we check on oil in upstream companies, we can save time and money in investigating and seizing downstream. Non-government organizations are more considerable than government, but they met much challenges on their way to success. How to overcome the strait is what we learned in this time conference and it also is what we can use in iGEM.</P><P>The place we visited: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/ngo" style="color:#00DB00">The John Tung Foundation</A></P></FIGURE><FIGURE><H4 class="article-subtitle">Industry</H4><P>We interviewed the basic of the society, the vendors. By interviewing them, we knew that the cost of testing oil is too high so that many vendors in Taiwan can't afford it. And we also visited some food companies to know the effect of the food scandals. We also visited some commercial companies to promote the philosophy of our project. Let more people know this subject. Last, in order to know whether the final product can be popularized to each person, we visited the biotech companies to look for some advices.</P><P>The place we visited: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/industry/vendors" style="color:#00DB00">Vendors</A></P></FIGURE></ARTICLE></DIV><DIV class="section"><ARTICLE class="article"><H3 class="article-title">Material</H3><P class="article-p">We use four samples material to promote our project.</P><FIGURE><P>The material we used: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/material/app" style="color:#00DB00">APP</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/material/ppt" style="color:#00DB00">PPT</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/material/video" style="color:#00DB00">Video</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/material/poster" style="color:#00DB00">Poster</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/material/questionnaires" style="color:#00DB00">Questionnaires</A></P></FIGURE></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="article"><H3 class="article-title">Cooperation</H3><P class="article-p">In addition to telling other people our thought, exchange the ideas and information is also important, so we participated in two activities to obtain others' experience and learn from one another.</P><FIGURE><P>The two activities we took part in: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/cooperation/meetup" style="color:#00DB00">Meet Up</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/cooperation/asianconference" style="color:#00DB00">Asian Conference</A></P></FIGURE></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="article"><H3 class="article-title">Community</H3><P class="article-p">We used Fan Page to dialogue with the community.</P><FIGURE><P>Our Fan page: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/community" style="color:#00DB00">Fans Page</A></P></FIGURE></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="article"><H3 class="article-title">Lawyer</H3><FIGURE><P>Lawyer we visited: <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/hp/lawyer" style="color:#00DB00">Lawyer</A></P></FIGURE></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></MAIN><FOOTER><DIV class="footer-cell"><P><A href="http://www.hs.ntnu.edu.tw">HSNU | Taipei</A></P></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
