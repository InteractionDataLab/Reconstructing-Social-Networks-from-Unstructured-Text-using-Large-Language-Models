✡ Review of the hole promotions
Compare with those promotions we've done in those previous junior high, preparations for the promotion this time in Tam-shui junior high are more complete. Those respond we've got were really great. After working on the promotion for so long, to receive those worm response from children is the most invaluable thing ever. Some of the children even got many different opinions about our project and we are really willing to make some discussions with them to improve our project together.
✡ Improvement
During the promotion, we forgot to bring our poster with us, so we could only replace it by cardboard.Because of the equipment requirement, we should use paper forms instead of internet forms cause some of them even give up filling them because the lack of internet connection.
