					We collaborate with several schools.
					1. We had meeting with NYMU-Taipei every Thursday night.
					2. We consult with NYMU-Taipei and NCTU_Formosa for the information and technique.
					3. NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan share experimental experience with us. Also, sharing plasmid BBa_B0015 and restriction enzymes.
					4. We interflowed with Mingdao. We exchanged our ideas.
					5. NJAU_China shared their experimental experience in part BBa_K1555000 with us.

She is a professor in the institute of health and welfare policy.  We had a few meetings in framing our human practice part.  Professor Chang at NYMU also gave us great suggestions on human practice part.  We think our project is involved with two parts: food safety and synthetic biology.  Thus, we think we should devote efforts on understanding the social justice, security and social impact related to the food safety part.  In terms of synthetic biology, we need to know related professional knowledge, such as intellectual property rights, safety and popularity of this new technique. 
We first identified three dimensions of the human practice: 
(1)technology/profession: to understand the technique that we design can be used and successfully applied by the public
(2)education/communication: to promote the synthetic biology in iGEM project, and also receive feedbacks and comments from the society
(3)social impact: to investigate relate issues in food safety in Taiwan.

				<P class="description">As we defined three dimension for our Human practice, we quickly list the work for each dimension: 
(1)technology/profession: to understand the technique that we design can be used and successfully applied by the public.  We need to collect professional comments from professors, food suppliers, bio-tech industry and the public.  
(2)education/communication: to promote the synthetic biology in iGEM project, and also receive feedbacks and comments from the society.  We decided that our human practice part should serve the role of education and communication.  Thus, we need to visit schools of different levels and the public.  
(3)social impact: to investigate relate issues in food safety in Taiwan. We should  comprehend it from a macro view, not only being upset consumers and complaining about the government.  Dr. Tsai believed we should target understanding the policy design because many issues (ethics, social justice, safety, security, culture, budget constraints) have to be considered in policy development.  Thus, we decided to investigate related policies, how the government implements the policies, and the effectiveness of the policies.  Also she believed that we should approach and examining these issues from different sectors, not only listening to the governmental officers. To make sure the system will work out well, we visited (1)executive departments, (2)legislative departments and lawyers, (3)non-governmental organization, (4)industry, and (5)vendors, (6) school.  We are very proud of work in education.  We visited many schools across every age group, teacher's inter-district communities, senior high schools, junior high, elementary schools and kindergarten. We produced two game apps which are free on Google Play Store, named Gene Check and Gene Maker. (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:HSNU-TAIPEI/Practices">See our Human Practice</A>)

				<P class="description">We designed a product which contains E. coli with the gene fragments to detect toxins. We embed E.coli into microcapsules. We have a biological safety system. The embedding of E. coli saves cost and time and has high-efficiency detection mechanisms. Our experiment results indicated that immobilizing E. coli can successfully detect toxins. Besides, our work on biosafety issue is to reduce the risk that the E-coli will leak out and contaminate the environment. We have developed triple biosafety certificated mechanisms that will reduce the risk. We developed our product which has been successfully experimental test of feasibility. For example, 4ppm copper ion can induce the microcapsule glow within five minutes.
