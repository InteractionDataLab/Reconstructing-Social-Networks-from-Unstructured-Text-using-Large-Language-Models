Team Profile
Hello! We, the iGEM team of IIT Kharagpur, are a team of                   enthusiastic biotechnologists in training. A mixed group of students of all                   ages, we strive towards the common goal of competing with the most                   brilliant young minds in the field while evolving our own knowledge and                   helping out make the world a slightly better place in the process. All of us belong to the same discipline of biotechnology with diverse                   specializations, and we are from the Indian Institute of Technology                   Kharagpur, located in West Bengal, India. Though we share a common                   interest and discipline, the group itself is quite diverse and the contribution                   of each person is needed to make things happen. Our group is dedicated                   and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if                   that's what it takes. We have been fortunate in our guides who have been patient                   and extremely supporting. We may have started out late, but                   we have high expectations from our team both with regard to                   the competition and ourselves. It's a learning experience why                   we won't have fun all the same!

He is an enthusiastic                     guy who is always up for the challenge. Initially hesitant                     to venture into this field of synthetic biology, he says                     that after seeing its immense potential and the importance                     of its applications,  he has never looked back. He believes                     that synthetic biology is the platform through which                     genetic engineering, man's gift to the world of biology, is                     put to test.

Adarsh Mukesh
Undergraduate StudentTeam: Wet Lab Work
Adarsh, from the state of Jharkhand, is a cautiously curious person. When not involved in some                     work or the other, he likes to read or simply listen to his favorite tracks. Fascinated by the                     concept of evolution, he thinks that it is much more exciting to study the systems that are a                     result of millions of years of continuous and successful evolutions rather than those which have                     been around for the past few decades.

Preferring to take the road less travelled, Jugal is a self motivated team member. He comes                     from the state of Odisha. Apart from research, photography is of interest to him. He is fascinated                     by the creation of life in the form of microbes. He is convinced that these architects of life hold                     the solutions to all problems vexing life on earth.
Rhushikesh Phadke
Undergraduate StudentTeam: Wet Lab Work
Apparently too complex to try and explain, Rhushikesh has an admiration for the precise and                     breathtaking working of life systems. Hailing from the state of Maharashtra, he can be found on                     the badminton court when not working on anything else. He is attracted towards the field of                     research by the idea that there is enormous potential left untouched in every form of life, just                     waiting to be unleashed to take all of life to a whole new level.
