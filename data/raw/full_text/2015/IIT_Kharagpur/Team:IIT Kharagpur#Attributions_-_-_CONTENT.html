	The frontrunners of the wet lab work were <I>Roshan</I>, <I>Sriram</I>, <I>Harsheel</I> and <I>Yogesh</I>. Each step was discussed before and reviewed after it was done, within themselves and with our guide <B>Prof. Agneyo Ganguly</B>. Our research scholars <I>Ms Swagata</I> and <I>Ms Shikha</I> deserve special thanks for showing us the road and driving on track every time we lost our way. 
<B>Community:</B>
	The workshop presentation at the <B>Institute of Genetic Engineering (IGE), Kolkata</B> was delivered by three student members of our team - <I>Adarsh</I>, <I>Chetan</I> and <I>Pruthv</I>. We would like to thank <B>Professor Amit Chakravarty (Director, IGE)</B> and <B>Professor Sudipa Chakravarty (HOD, Microbiology Department, IGE)</B> for this opportunity to conduct a workshop at institute.

Two of our student team members - <I>Adarsh</I> and <I>Dipasha</I>, also visited West Medinipur, Kolkata to teach the students about food spoilage and its reasons. The students were, in a very simple and lucid way, explained about the concepts of Synthetic Biology and its applications.
<B>Guide Book:</B>

The content of our <B>“Guide Book on Food Spoilage”</B> was primarily curated and organized by <I>Jugal</I>  and <I>Karan</I>, two of our student team members. The final formatting, layout designing and structuring was done by <I>Roshan</I>, <I>Varshit</I> and <I>Harsheel</I>. We learnt a lot in the process of making this booklet and hope it benefits as many people as possible.

<B>Surveys:</B>

We launched two surveys – One essentially revolving around the theme of <B>“Food Spoilage”</B>, and the other targeting the experienced iGEM teams around the world, so as to gather useful and critical information to <B>“Guide the Beginner”</B> iGEM teams. We would like to thank <B>all the people</B> and <B>iGEM teams</B> across the world who participated in our surveys and helped us gather the data we needed 
for our analysis.
<B>Wiki Creation:</B>
	The style, theme and development of our iGEM wiki were responsibly handled by two of our student team members – Satyam (Web-Wizard) and Sanjay (Designing-Maestro)
<B>Wiki Content Development:</B>
Every student member of the team chipped in for this. The content of the pages was developed by the third year undergraduate student members of the team (<B>special mention</B>: <I>Jugal</I>, <I>Dipasha</I>, <I>Adarsh</I> and <I>Rhushikesh</I>) was supervised and guided by the fourth year members <I>Varshit</I>, <I>Roshan</I> and <I>Harsheel</I>. The video-making and editing was done by <I>Harsheel</I>, <I>Rhushikesh</I>, <I>Sanjay</I> and <I>Shaurya</I>.<B>Project Modeling:</B>
We would like to thank <B>Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek</B> of the Department of Electronics Electrical Communication Engineering, IIT Kharagpur for his help in explaining to us a bacterial system’s pathway modelling. We got to know about some platforms from where we can build our concepts on system engineering and mathematical modelling. The initial mathematical models were prepared by <I>Adarsh</I> and <I>Rhushikesh</I>.

<B>Guidance:</B>
We also would like to thank <B>Professor Agneyo Ganguly</B> (our Project Instructor), <B>Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek</B> and <B>Professor Hari Niwas Mishra</B> (Professor, Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur) for helping us get through our obstacles at each turn.
<B>Professor H.N.Mishra</B> helped us specifically with understanding more about the statistics of different types of grain spoilage in India, and gave a lot of useful suggestions for the potential “Food Contamination Detection” product kit that could result from the successful and complete implementation of our project idea.


For our two wonderful <B>Meet-ups</B> (over the summers), we would like to thank the <B>iGEM teams IISER_Pune</B> and <B>NCTU_Formosa</B>. The meetups definitely served as a great platform for us to practice and test our level of preparation before our actual presentation at the Giant Jamboree. 


We also had a great time collaborating with the iGEM teams – <B>iGEM UCSF Team, CU Boulder iGEM Team</B> and the <B>iGEM UI-Indonesia Team</B>. 


Additionally, we helped a lot of teams with the publicity of their surveys, such as the teams – <B>iGEM Paris Bettencourt, iGEM NEFU_China,  iGEM Korea_U_Seoul, iGEM Team Nankai.</B>
We have indeed have a great time interacting and collaborating with several iGEM teams across the world. This has been an experience that we will always cherish. And we look forward to meeting all the other iGEM teams in Boston next week! 

<B>Special Thanks:</B> For capturing great pictures of our team, we would like to thank <I>Nikesh Aryan (Undergraduate Student, Department of Biotechnology, IIT Kharagpur)</I>.
