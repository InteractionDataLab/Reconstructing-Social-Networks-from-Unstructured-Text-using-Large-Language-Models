				Food Spoilage ­ What your mom doesn’t know about!

Food spoilage is a common kitchen disaster hiding behind a closed shelf or buried deep within 

refrigerator which all of us have been frustrated with. It is one of the most important reasons a 

lot of quality edible food product go to waste. Spoilage is characterized by any change in a food 

product that renders it unacceptable to the consumer from a sensory point of view. (Lone Gram, 

2002)  In reality it is a vibrant problem though pictured individually this picture does not zoom 

out beyond minor negligence in kitchen – leaving yogurt out in open, cauliflowers pushed too far 

behind in the chill tray.  However these food spoilage incidents do happen at industrial and farm 

level  too  where  a  lot  of  quality  raw  product  can  go  to  waste  before  it  can  be  made  fit  for 

consumption. Expenses which would have to be taken into consideration because of it would 

include:  medical  care,  including  hospital  costs;  laboratory  investigations;  the  cost  to  the 

economy generally of production and wages lost through illness; loss of production and market 

share  for  food  manufacturers  implicated  in  outbreaks,  and  legal  expenses  in  the  event  of 

prosecution or claims for compensation (Eley, 1992). All of this accounts for a large economic 

loss.

There are two main reasons for food spoilage: ­ “Naturally occurring biochemical changes” and 

“Microbial Activity”. Similar to human’s digestion microbes – bacteria and fungi break down the 

food particles into simple derivatives acids and similar other waste products may be released 

changing the physical properties and chemical structure of our food. In severe cases they can 

cause food poisonings and in extreme experiences have also resulted in death!  Between 1980­

1989 Cases of food poisoning bacteria in England and Wales rose from 10856 to 25818. (Eley, 

1992).

When food gets  spoilt we generally tend to identify it by tasting or detecting  change in  color, 

texture or smell.  Simple and comfortable these tactics are, they elude us from identifying these 

issues beyond our daily context. One simple example of this would be biofilm formation in food 

processing  plants  where  they  cause  extensive  losses  due  to  equipment  failure  or  necessary 

extensive cleanup.

In past few decades detection of quorum sensing signals in spoiled food products has added a 

new dimension to study the process of food spoilage. The bacterial phenomenon of cell­to­cell 

communication using signaling molecules is known as quorum sensing. Bacteria takes decisive 

action  based  upon  assessing  local  cell  densities.  Cell­to­cell  communication  depends  on  the 

production  of,  secretion  of,  and  response  to  small,  diffusible  signal  molecules  called 

&quot;autoinducers&quot;.  The  signal  molecules  are  produced  and  secreted  at  a  basal  level  during 

bacterial growth. Their  concentration in the environmental medium or matrix increases as the 

bacterial population expands, and when it reaches a threshold level (quorum level).  It induces 

phenotypic  effects  by  regulating  quorum­sensing  dependent  target  gene  expression.  This 

phenomenon occurs without any external intervention and is also referred to as auto induction.

A  very  common  quorum  system  found  widely  in  gram  negative  bacteria  is  AHL  based 

communication.  AHL  or  N­Acyl  Homoserine  Lactone  is  an  autoinducer,  a  part  of  quorum 

sensing  network  in  multiple  bacteria  and  has  thus  confirmed  the  role  of  inter  cell  signaling 

pathway in food spoilage. They are found in milk and other dairy products which are the fastest 

among  the  perishable  items  to  get  spoilt.  A  systematic  study  has  discovered  spoilage  to  be 

caused by AHL producing bacteria.  This study and its results brought new perspective into how 

food  spoilage  can  be  prevented  by  selectively  targeting  this  signaling  pathway  and  thus 

preventing microbial action to take place despite their favorable number and conditions.

Quorum­sensing  signaling molecules  can be detected from  cell free  supernatants, extracts of 

food samples, and spent culture supernatants of bacteria isolated from food products (Ammor 

and others 2008).The use of bacterial biosensors has made the detection and quantification of 

different  types  of  these  signals  like AHLs  easier,  economical,  and  faster. An AHL  biosensors 

contain  a  functional  LuxR  family  protein  cloned  with  a  cognate  target  promoter  (usually  the 

promoter of the cognate luxI synthase), which up regulates the expression of a reporter gene 

encoding for a phenotypic response only in the presence of exogenous AHLs, as they do not 

produce the signaling molecules but only possess their cognate receptors.

Affirmative  action  using  quorum  sensing  inhibitors  can  be  taken  in  food  preservation  also. 

Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  are  typically  analogues  of  the  AHLs,  or  compounds  that  degrade 

AHLs. A promising group of quorum­sensing inhibitors is the halogenated furanones produced

by the Australian red alga, Delisea pulchra (Givskov and others 1996). The initial  cytotoxicity 

and  chemically  unstable  nature  of  these  inhibitors  has  prompted  the  screening  of  nontoxic 

quorum­sensing inhibitors from natural sources. Plants used in traditional medicine are one of 

the most promising areas in the  search for new biologically active  compounds. In a  study by 

Vattem  and  others  (2007),  dietary  phytochemicals  from  plants  known  to  have  several  health 

benefits  and  antimicrobial  activity,  exhibited  quorum­sensing  inhibitory  activity  at  sub  lethal 

concentrations. Vanilla,  a  widely  used  spice  and  flavor,  can  inhibit  bacterial  quorum  sensing. 

Quorum­sensing  inhibitors  may  prevent  colonization  of  food  surfaces,  toxin  formation,  and 

proliferation of food­related bacteria. The natural occurrence of quorum­sensing inhibitors is an 

important consideration for the assessment of their toxicological status and may facilitate their 

use in food as preservatives and hence pave way for the application of novel food preservation 

techniques. (Rai, 2011)

Recent  modern  applications  of  microbiology  in  food  spoilage  have  caused  much  buzz  in 

academic world. The discovery of novel biochemical pathways and subsequent development of 

their  applications  is  increasingly  bringing  up  new  perspective  to  combat  the  intimidating 

challenge  of  food  security.  Though  the  general  masses  at  large  is  still  oblivious  to  role  of 

microbiota  in  their  dietary  habits.  Fermentation  helps  in  making  bread  and  pasteurization  is 

enough to purify milk is the saturation of public’s knowledge about food spoilage. A systematic 

campaign to spread awareness at grass root level would boost public’s interest in food spoilage 

beyond their monthly budget into the spectrum of global challenge of food security. That would 

hopefully  lead  to  more  developed  industrial  base  providing  cheap  protection  against  food 

spoilage..

 As this is the first time we, the students of IIT Kharagpur are participating in iGEM, we did not

have a pre­existing team of seniors to guide us and make things streamlined for us. Had there 

been  an  existing  team,  we  would  have  had  regular  rounds  of  selections  into  the  team  and 

organised way of work right from the beginning. But this was not the case with us. The students 

in our department were not aware of iGEM and so it was not easy to straight­away build a team. 

Few of our seniors, Krishna, Madhur, Kaustav and Ayushman, students in the current fifth year 

batch, took the initiative. During their summer interns in various universities across the globe, 

they  had  come  across  iGEM  teams  operating  in  the  respective  institutions.  Gradually,  they 

came  to  know  about  iGEM  in  greater  detail  and  the  opportunity  we  had  as  a  commendable 

participant  in  the  competition.  On  their  return  to  Kharagpur,  they  called  in  all  the  interested 

students  from  the  third  and  fourth  year  batches  and  held  regular  meetings  to  discuss  about 

iGEM  and  explain  its  significance.  Students,  who  had  poor  background  on  synthetic  biology 

were given articles to read so that they cleared their funda. Finally, after a few weeks, towards 

the  end  of  January,  we  had  a  fairly  motivated  team  ready  to  brainstorm  ideas  for  the  much 

coveted competition.

<H3>Formulation &amp; finalization of idea:</H3>
 For facilitating the idea formulation process, the entire team of third years and fourth years was 

divided into five sub­teams, each composed of 1­2 fourth years and 2­3 third years. Each team 

was allotted the task of going through literature and coming up with new ideas that could act as 

potential bases for our iGEM project. Each team used to discuss independently, meet frequently 

in the library, and prepare presentations on the idea that they thought upon. As the exams were 

approaching and the deadlines were less than 2 weeks, the teams had to go through a really 

rough patch. Some members were not able to come regularly due to some urgent problems and 

the other members used to take up their job and do it religiously. It was real teamwork at display 

then.

On the day of the idea discussions, each team presented their idea before the fifth years and 

other teams. It was subjected to rigorous scrutiny and a torrent of questions basing on which the 

ideas were evaluated. Out of the five ideas, two ideas were eventually shortlisted and the entire 

team  was  now  re­grouped  into  two  sub­teams  working  independently  on  the  two  ideas.  The 

existing  knowledge  from  the  previous  level  was  augmented  with  in­depth  book­reading  and 

feasibility analysis. After a week, the two ideas were consolidated and extended presentations 

were made to be presented to the professors.

<H3>Pitching of idea in front of professors:</H3>
 The  shortlisted  ideas  were  presented  in  the  form  of  two  long  presentations,  followed  by  a

detailed  question­answer  session.  All  faculty  members  of  our  department  were  present  and 

were  actively  involved  in  it,  putting  forth  their  ideas  and  queries. After  a  2  hour­long  debate, 

finally one of the ideas was chosen to be feasible for the project. However, due to lack of any 

available prototype at that point of time, many of the professors rejected the idea of participation 

in this  year’s  competition,  stating that it would be unwise to give  consent to  something which 

had  no  proof  of  materialising  within  a  week’s  time.  As  the  deadlines  for  registration  were 

approaching,  we  had  serious  troubles  in  convincing  the  professors  that  we  would  be  able  to 

deliver the results in the right time.

This session was to be followed by a meeting with the dean and a panel of high­ranked officials 

of our institute. But that too got delayed due to the absence of the dean on some urgent matter. 

We had no option in hand but to request the iGEM office for an extension in the deadline on the 

plea of delay in arrangement of funds. To our luck, the iGEM office responded positively, and 

extended the deadline by a few weeks.

<H3>Registration, consolidation of idea and selection of guide:</H3>
 Not all the professors had opposed to the idea of our participation in this year’s iGEM. Prof. Dey 

and Prof. Ganguly were in strong favour of the idea. This prevented us from losing all hope and 

we kept on the struggle. With their help, we were able to rearrange the meet with the dean and 

after a lot of effort, the plan was approved. As a result, funds were sanctioned by the institute 

and we were able to register towards the end of April. All the registration formalities were carried 

out  and  Prof.  Ganguly  was  chosen  as  the  principal  guide  of  our  iGEM  team  because  of  his 

expertise  in  synthetic  biology  and  his  willingness  to  dedicate  time  and  resources  for  the 

consolidation and success of the project.

In the next few weeks, several meetings were held amongst the team members and with our 

guide.  Related  papers  were  presented  and  discussed  and  the  idea  was  consolidated. 

Accordingly, the work­flow for the project was chalked out. As many of the fourth year students 

were going abroad for summer internships, the ones staying back had to schedule their work in 

the  lab  and  distribute  the  work  to  the  many  third  years  who  were  staying  back  too.  Those 

members  who  were  going  for  interns  also  ensured  progress  of  the  wiki  content  development 

and other non lab­related assignments.

<H3>Lab work:</H3>
 Wet­Lab work regarding transformations and cloning had started before the arrival of the Kit of 

Parts. Sriram and few other third year students had stayed back in the summers and practised 

the  various methods of rDNA technology. Prof. Ganguly, along with few of his PhD  students, 

was himself present throughout the  summer to train our team members in these procedures. 

The Kit of Parts arrived in the summer vacation period itself. After that, experiments began with 

full force and as the  vacations ended, the rest of the team members, who had gone for their 

internships,  joined  in  one  after  the  other.  All  the  wet­lab  work  was  carried  out  in  the  fully 

equipped UG lab of our department which remains open 24X7.

Our  experiments  were  often  interrupted  by  setbacks  and  challenges.  When  we  first  tried  to 

transform  the  luxR  and  crtEBI,  we  did  not  get  the  colonies.  This  may  have  been  a result  of 

experimental errors like improper  spreading or  so. However, after  several attempts, we  could 

rectify  it  and  obtained  colonies.  We  checked  our  plasmids  by  using  appropriate  restriction 

enzymes and running gels. Another serious problem arose in case of ligation. The ligation was 

carried out for 16hrs with an insert:vector ratio of 3:1 but we did not get any colonies at all! We 

assumed that ligation was not occurring due to improper digestions of the insert. So we carried 

out sequential digestion and again tried the ligation in the same procedure. This time we got a 

single  colony  and  on  screening  it,  we  found  it  to  be  the  undigested  luxPR  transformant!  We 

were terribly disappointed.

Next, we tried checking whether there was any problem in the competent cells. For this, we took 

a positive control of 50ug/ml of luxPR DNA and tried the ligation procedure again but with no 

better result. After that, we started working on another way of cloning where we tried to get 55 

bps  of  luxPR  cut  with  restriction  enzymes.  On  performing  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and 

crtEBI, and running the product on 2% agarose gel, we were not able to get the 55 bps band 

(instead, we got a gradient of bands of  same length). Yet, we did not lose hope. We  started 

again  with  the  “3A  Assembly”  :  sequential  digestion  of  luxPR  and  crtEBI,  PCR  purification, 

double digestion ­ luxPR with ECoRI and crtEBI with XbaI followed by heat kill for 5 mins. This 

time we used 3:1:0.5 , 1:1:0.5 of luxPR:crtEBI:kanamycin backbone DNAs for ligation (16hrs) 

and finally succeeded in getting colonies.

Several other hurdles were also encountered by our wet­lab team. But our motivation boosted 

our patience and perseverance to keep on struggling till we achieve the result.

<H3>National Meet­up:</H3>
 The IISER Pune iGEM team organized an Indian iGEM meetup during July 16­17, 2015. This

meetup had three of the four Indian iGEM teams (for the year 2015) participate in it, namely IIT 

Delhi,  IISER Pune  and  IIT Kharagpur.  IIT Delhi  had  sent  three representatives  of  their  team, 

while two of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During 

the  first  day  (16th  July),  there  was  an  informal  discussion  session  amongst  all  the  teams, 

followed  by  IISER  Pune’s  project  presentation  in  the  afternoon.  While  the  second  day  (17th 

July)  had  the  presentations  of  our  team  (in  the  morning)  and  IIT  Delhi’s  presentation  in  the 

afternoon. 

IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in 

awe,  and  in  a  way  left  the  other  teams  with  no  choice  but  to  further  improvise  their 

presentations. All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive 

presentation, which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer 

simulation based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, 

and had it divided into three sub­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet­lab work. 

While  IISER  Pune  wishes  to  compete  in  the  Health  and  Medicine  track  of  iGEM,  IIT  Delhi 

wishes to compete in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation 

of  their  idea,  which  was  appreciated  by  the  audience.  After  each  of  the  team  presentations 

(which  typically  lasted  about  an  hour),  there  were  question­answer  sessions  held,  where  the 

clarity and idea of each of the teams’ projects were scrutinized. 

Very  useful  suggestions  and  points  were  raised  for  each  of  the  teams  post  their 

presentations,  and  all  the  discussions  (both  formal  and  informal)  were  very  productive  and 

propitious  for  the  teams,  in  general. We  learnt  a  lot  about  iGEM  through  this  meetup,  got  to 

meet  a  lot  of  people,  and  are  confident  that  the  advice  and  suggestions  given  during  this 

meetup would definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.

<H3>NCTU­Formosa regional meet up:</H3>
 The NCTU Formosa iGEM Meetup was held during July 19­23, 2015. This was the third time

NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the Asian iGEM teams. It 

was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like Taiwan, China, India, 

etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup were IISER Pune and 

IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the meetup in person, or 

to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our team went ahead with 

the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the evening (Taiwan Time) of 

the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). 

The  main  idea  behind  our  team’s  participation  in  this  meetup  was  to  get  advice  and 

suggestions  from  experienced  iGEM  teams  with  regard  to  our  project  ­  wet  lab,  policy  and 

practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format 

of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question 

and answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of 

our project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered 

at  the  seminar room  in  NCTU,  Taiwan)  were  tackled  by  some  of  the  senior  members  of  the 

team,  as  a  whole.  Very  valid  questions  were  raised  by  the  audience,  and  many  useful 

suggestions were given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant 

Jamboree, and tackle each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as to give 

our first time participation in iGEM the best we have. This meetup was indeed a great learning 

experience, and has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
 			

 			
 

<H3>8. Strategy discussions:</H3>
			
 After our institute re­opened post summer vacation, we have had a series of meetings amongst

the team members. They were mostly aimed at focusing on the design of wiki and all other stuff 

regarding  meeting  the  necessary  requirements  for  a  proper  website.  Apart  from  that, 

discussions on the design of poster, banner and video were also held. Proposals for community 

participation were also entertained.

On  the  3rd  of  August,  our  team  had  a  major  strategy  discussion  meeting  covering  all  the 

pressing issues with regard to the pending work for the grand competition finale at Boston.The 

entire  team  actively  participated  and  contributed  to  the  discussion,  several  beneficial 

suggestions were put forth, and updates on all the completed tasks were made. It was definitely 

a very productive session, and tasks were assigned hoping to execute our re­defined strategies 

in the best way possible!

On the 15th of August, some of our team members met for the iGEM project modelling related 

discussion.Equations hypothesizing the reaction rate kinetics of our system were put forth, and 

the required biochemical assays for each of the entities were discussed. The kinds of graphs to 

be made and associated modelling to be done were finalized.Post all the technical discussion, 

we ended the session on a lighter note by deciding a catchy tag­line for our project!

On  the  22nd  of  August,  we  had  a  meeting  regarding  sponsorship  and  media  outreach.  We 

discussed important methods to be undertaken to increase awareness of our project. An article 

was written by Jugal to be sent for media purposes and we also put forth ideas for the making of 

a brochure.
