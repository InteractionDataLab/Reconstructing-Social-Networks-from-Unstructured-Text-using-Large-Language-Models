			SAFETY IS NOT A GADGET BUT A STATE OF MIND
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="container safety-mid1"><H2>Safety</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6"><DIV class="safety-desc">
					The Department of Biotechnology, IIT Kharagpur focuses on safe working with biological materials - for

						both human beings and the environment. We at iGEM IIT Kharagpur take special pride in our disciplined 

						and regimented laboratory guidelines when it comes to safety from biohazard. Biological materials, in 

						general include genetically modified organisms (GMO), biological agents, plant pathogens/quarantine 

						material and animal by-products. The misuse or the spread of these materials without proper human 

						intervention is what can cause a potential biohazard or at a large scale, a bio-disaster. Therefore, strict 

						emphasis on restriction or limitation of these materials is required when they are directly hazardous to 

						humans, animals or plants. In all cases, the researcher, lecturer, student or third party is consciously 

						working with material that may have hazardous effects of which the person is not always aware in 

						advance. In such cases it is necessary to ask advice of the biosafety officer in order to be able to work 

						safely with the material and in order to meet applicable laws and regulations.

					Our laboratories are all under the keen supervision of expert personnel (Both professor and 

						maintenance staff) at IIT Kharagpur. All of our safety guidelines are as per norms of Department of 

						Biotechnology, India. Link to 

						<A target="_blank" href="http://dbtbiosafety.nic.in/Files/CD_IBSC/Files/Guidelines%20_Handbook_2011.pdf">General laboratory safety guidelines.</A>

						Accordingly our lab has been issued a biosafety level xxxx by Government of India.

								1. All eatables and beverages are strictly prohibited inside the laboratory.

								2. Regular drills in fire escape and use of fire extinguishers. Emergency first aid box kit is always kept at 

								   easily accessible to hand places and is equipped with treatment for small cuts, burns and chemical spills. 

								All members are trained in basic first aid skills.

								3. Reusable and non reusable equipments are kept distinguish from each other and all the lab members 

								   take regular turn in disposing of waste materials in a sound scientific manner.

								4. Wear laboratory coats and other appropriate protective clothing while performing laboratory 

								   activities. Feet and legs should be covered; sandals and open-toed shoes should not be worn in 

								laboratories. Wear appropriate gloves while handling infectious or toxic materials and animals. Do not 

								wear lab coats. Gloves or other personal protective equipment outside the laboratory.

								5. Use a biological safety cabinet for handling infectious materials or materials requiring protection from 

								contamination and a fume hood for toxic materials; mixed hazards need to be evaluated case by case.

								6. Fume hoods should be used for laboratory activities that could result in chemical explosions or fires, 

								for experiments involving toxic, hazardous or carcinogenic compounds and use of strong acids and 

								bases. Biological safety cabinets should not be used for this kind of work. 

								7. Chemical and radioactive waste must not be poured down the drain. Learn the proper handling of all 

								chemical substances before using them. In case of uncertainty ask a senior member to supervise your 

								activities.

								8. All materials should be kept at their proper positions after their use has been concluded. An alternate 

								facility is maintained in case of regular storage rooms, fridges etc. are repaired or moved.

								9. Never mouth pipettes anything. Use mechanical pipetting devices only!

								10. Decontaminate all work surfaces daily, and decontaminate all spills immediately.

								11. Decontaminate (by autoclaving or chemical disinfection) all biologically contaminated materials – 

								glassware, animal cages, laboratory equipment, etc. – before washing, reuse or disposal. Discard 

								materials via proper waste stream.

								12. Syringes, needles, pipettes, etc, should be placed in rigid, leak-proof containers (Sharps Safe) and 

								discarded following the waste rules.

								13. Broken glassware and disposable pipettes (after decontamination) should be placed in a “Disposable 

								Lab ware and Broken Glass Box” and discarded following the waste rules.

								14. Wash your hands after handling chemicals, infectious materials, animals, after removing gloves and 

								before leaving the laboratory.

								15. The Biological waste is divided into two categories and handled accordingly:

								    &gt;Liquid waste with biological factors is autoclaved and thereafter disposed of as hazardous waste in 

								accordance with &quot;Guideline for disposal of hazardous waste and problematic waste, ionizing sources of 

								radiation and explosive waste.

								    &gt;Solid waste is autoclaved and treated as residual waste if it does not contain chemical residues.

								Biosafety at the workplace i.e our laboratory, for the working staff, the general population and finally, 

								the environment is our top priority and is achieved by proper containment of biologically and chemically 

								hazardous agents. Containment is ensured at research stage, when modifications are made, 

								development work in the laboratory, greenhouse or growth room, The only risks involved are for those 

								working in the laboratory and containment parameters are devised to ensure that the organism would 

								not escape into the environment, or if it should, it would have been so designed not to survive in the 

								open. All the handling of cell culture, bacterial colonies are carried out under laminar hood. The work 

								bench, hood and hands of active members are washed both prior and after the laboratory work is done 

								with rectified ethanol spirit. All the cell culture colonies are tightly wrapped with parafilm and 

								maintained at 4 degree Celsius when not in use.
