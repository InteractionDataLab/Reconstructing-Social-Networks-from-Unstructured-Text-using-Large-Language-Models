Meetup Writeups:
True spirit of iGEM lies not in competition but in collaboration. With dawn of synthetic biology,  it became absolutely clear that future of biological sciences lies not in closed gate patenting but   in open source innovation. iGEM teams all over the world organize team meetups with other   teams where discussion, critique and feedback over the each team project is given by all. Such   discussions are extremely helpful as they provide a wide diversity of opinions and filter the   subtle nuisances before Giant Jamboree. Our team was invited for two iGEM meetups ­ one   Indian iGEM team meetup by IISER Pune and other an Asian regional meetup organized by   NCTU, Taiwan. Both of the experiences have been very informative as well as enlightening.   Details of individual meetups are described below.
IISER Pune Meetup July 16­17, 2015.
The IISER Pune iGEM team organized an Indian iGEM meetup during This meetup had  three of the four Indian iGEM teams (for the year 2015) participate in it, namely IIT Delhi,   IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. IIT Delhi had sent three representatives of their team, while two   of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During the first day   (16th July), there was an informal discussion session amongst all the teams, followed by IISER   Pune’s project presentation in the afternoon. While the second day (17th July) had the   presentations of our team (in the morning) and IIT Delhi’s presentation in the afternoon. IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in  awe, and in a way left the other teams with no choice but to further improvise their presentations.   All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive presentation,   which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer simulation   based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, and had it   divided into three sub­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet­lab work. While IISER   Pune wishes to compete in the Health and Medicine track of iGEM, IIT Delhi wishes to compete   in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation of their idea, which   was appreciated by the audience. After each of the team presentations (which typically lasted   about an hour), there were question­answer sessions held, where the clarity and idea of each of   the teams’ projects were scrutinized. Very useful suggestions and points were raised for each of the teams post their  presentations, and all the discussions (both formal and informal) were very productive and   propitious for the teams, in general. We learnt a lot about iGEM through this meetup, got to meet   a lot of people, and are confident that the advice and suggestions given during this meetup would   definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot.
NCTU Meetup:July 19­23, 2015
This was the third time NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the   Asian iGEM teams. It was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like   Taiwan, China, India, etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup   were IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the   meetup in person, or to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our   team went ahead with the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the   evening (Taiwan Time) of the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). The main idea behind our team’s participation in this meetup was to get advice and   suggestions from experienced iGEM teams with regard to our project ­ wet lab, policy and   practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format   of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question and   answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of our   project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered at the   seminar room in NCTU, Taiwan) were tackled by some of the senior members of the team, as a   whole. Very valid questions were raised by the audience, and many useful suggestions were   given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant Jamboree, and tackle   each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as to give our first time   participation in iGEM the best we have. This meetup was indeed a great learning experience, and   has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston!
Survey Responses:
iGEM mandates organizing of surveys as public outreach practice for all participating teams and  for a good reason. Advancements in Biotechnology in recent years have created a buzz in   blogger communities, newspaper reports and science and technology television shows. A lot of   ideas have faced severe opposition on grounds of ethics, religion and simply uninformed   knowledge. Rise of GMOs in agriculture and medical care brought forward debate on the table   where many raised rejection of these products because of unfamiliar nature and impact of   convoluted ideas presented in scientific fiction. Since all iGEM teams are tinkering with the   biological entities to manufacture artificial life forms which can perhaps be in future transferred   as a routinely used technological platform like smartphones, computers and internet. It is   important that public’s opinion be sought, their contributions considered and their information   gap improved. Inspired by a plethora of surveys conducted by previous iGEM teams we developed some ideas  of our own. Since our project is based upon development of a household level device capable of   detecting microbial food spoilage which itself functions upon a synthetic bacteria (an improved   strain of E.coli DH alpha). The improvement is attributed to introduction of a single plasmid   possessing a luxR­AHL quorum sensing detection system which upon presence of [AHL]   beyond threshold level initiated the transcription of reporter gene and thus determining if food   product in question is spoilt or not.
If we told you we can create artificial organism to detect food spoilage in dairy and meat  products by change of colour, would you like to use it?
If it were an easy, quick and trustworthy biological food spoilage detector, how much would you  spend to buy it?
TO SHOW HOW RELIABLE THE REVIEWS ARE BY THE BACKGROUND OF THE  SURVEY TAKERS
How would you rate your health awareness on a scale of 1­10 (1: lowest to 10: highest)
TO SHOW WHICH SPECIFIC PRODUCT SHOULD WE INITIALLY TARGET  Which is the most common dairy product you use?
Which product do you generally face the problem of food spoilage?
TO SHOW THE NEED IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCT  On an average, what percent of your food expenses do you lose each month due to food   spoilage?
How much food products you buy is easily perishable?
REVIEWS BY THE SURVEY TAKERS:
Great survey!would be very useful ,if installed in food stores like McDonald's and  kfcetc.good luck! It is a good concept Your intiative is good.it is very useful to all obviously. It is a great initiative. Let's hope it solves the problem of food spoilage. Good luck iGEM team for your upcoming short innovation Bio­strip to detect food spoilage! seems to be a great and innovative idea. Its very good idea. We should fund this. Keeping in mind it should be affordable to everyone. Well 1st of all great work u guys are doing. proud of u guys as an alum of Biotech, IIT Kgp. "
SUGGESTIONS:
I wouldn't buy a detector, as I never had problems with spoiled food not being identifiable as  spoiled. as a food technologist I haven't heard about this. If food processors can put expiry date then what   different can GMO do? why will consumers pay extra? Consumer acceptance can be a big   problem in India. Be specific in detecting fungal/bacterial spoilage. Because most of our food of acidic nature is   damaged by fungal partners and food with high water activity by bacterial members. So, target a   specific group that covers wide food products. First of all would you pack the spoilage detector in the food packages before being purchased by   consumers? Or would you have a spoilage detector for individual consumer's detection for   example after opening of the food package? Would it be safe to use? How about disposal? Regarding the iGEM Groningen design in 2012: How would you make an applicable, useful and   simple detector for food e.g. in the fridge? If you put your detector into the fridge at time 0, how   fast would you know if the food is spoiled or not, regarding the design of your detector. E.g.   bacteria based detector needs bacteria to grow and produce certain compound resulting in the   detectable colour. Would the lower temperature have an effect on the time of compound   production and therefore the spoilage detection? For the best results at the competition, rethink   and discuss your application strategy with as many people as possible. Take the critique of the   design and try to make it better. Be prepared to answer all of those questions and to defend your   application design at the Jamboree (judges are very straightforward with the questions). Good   luck with the project! Regards from Tjaša, Wageningen 2014 BananaGuard. Well 1st of all great work u guys are doing. proud of u guys as an alum of Biotech, IIT Kgp. "If   there was an easy, quick and trustworthy biological food spoilage detector how much will you   spend to buy it?" i am confused­ Are u talking about the machine r the replaceble strips. Please   mention. All the best and jeetkeana.... I wouldn't pay a cent to buy something that will let me know if something is spoiled or not. In   my experience (I cook), I have till date been able to detect if a food is gone bad or not pretty   effectively. A strip or any other innovation on this arena, I think will not do any good as it is in   fact, redundant. Nature has already done this for us. All you're doing is appealing to the eyes,   which I believe would not really serve the purpose.
Interviews:
On the 3rd of September, three of our team members interviewed an eminent faculty  member of IIT Kharagpur, Prof. Hari Niwas Mishra of the Department of Agriculture and   Food  Engineering,  who  is  an  expert  in  the  field  of  Health  Foods & Nutraceuticals,   Innovative Food Processing Technologies  and Food Safety & Quality Control. This  is   how it went: us: Sir  you  have  been  working  in  this  field  for  about  21  years...can  you  tell  us  about  the   statistics of food spoilage in the country...like how much wood gets wasted every year due to   spoilage? prof  mishra: You  see,  a  few  days  ago  i  was reading  in  the  news reports  that  ICAR (Indian   Council of Agricultural Research) conducted a recent study in association with CIPHET (Central   Institute  of  Post­Harvest  Engineering  and  Technology),  which  involved  a  survey  to  assess   spoilage  incurred  in  food  storage,  handling,etc. According  to  the report,  4­8%  of  food  grains,   and 15­18% of perishables get destroyed every year due to food spoilage. us: Can  you  tell  us  about  the  various  techniques  that  are  currently  available  for  detection  of   food spoilage? prof  mishra: there  are  old  traditional  techniques  which  include  various  types  of  plating   methods,  and  techniques  to  obtain  microbial  counts  which  have  been  in  use  since  decades.   Among the new methods, electronic sensor­based techniques are more prevalent. Nowadays,   biological  kits,  for  detecting  specific  pathogenic  microbes  like  salmonella  are  also  available.   HiMedia is one such company making biochemical test kits. us: The  acceptability  of  GMOs  by  the  public  is  often  seen  as  an  issue  when  a  genetically   engineered product is released in the market. What are your views regarding the acceptability of   our product, if commercialised? prof  mishra: There  has  always  been  a  big  divide  in  the  Indian  society  when  it  comes  to   acceptance of any genetically engineered product. Equal groups of people are willing to accept   and  equal  groups  are  against  it.  Most  are  concerned  regarding  the  safety  of  the  product,   whether it has any side effects or not, since that has never been established in a solid manner   in the past. If somehow we can establish that our product is absolutely SAFE for consumer use,   then we can surely think of a long­term capture of the market. us: How do  you propose we  can  solve these issues regarding acceptability of our product, if   released? prof  mishra: We first need to analyse what the consumers want from our product. As in most of   the  food  products,  it  is  the  economic  and  nutritional  benefits  that  they  look  for...and   simultaneously the product must be safe to use continuously. These days, due to high level of   adulteration in food products, consumers are always in an apprehending mode and try to avoid   new products. But the change has to come at some point. For that, they have to be convinced   aptly. us: Do  you  think  that  our  product  can  be  easily  incorporated  into  the  food  quality  control   industry, given the available practices in that field? what industries can we target? prof  mishra: yeah, concept­wise, it appears OK. But still those people need to know the exact   details of how it works, the pros and cons, disposal issues (if any), which are the substrates on   which it works best and several other factors. The stability and user­friendliness of the product   are of utmost importance while deciding its integration into the market. You can target the local   companies manufacturing analytical instruments at first...they are the ones which  can try and   introduce  your product at a  small level and then increase  your influence gradually. Eg. Alpha   moss, novozymes, Fox, etc.
