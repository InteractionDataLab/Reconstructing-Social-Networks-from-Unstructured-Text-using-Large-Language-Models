Result: 2% gel was prepared since the LuxPR insert was only 55 bp. The gel wasn’t prepared properly. The same bands were observed twice. This was probably because the concentration was not   uniform throughout the height of the gel. The bands ran faster at the upper surface and slower   at the lower surface.  The 55 bp was not observed at all. 3 A Assembly Restriction Digestion: FIRST DIGESTION Part A
