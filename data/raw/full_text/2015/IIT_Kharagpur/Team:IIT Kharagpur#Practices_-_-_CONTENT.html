				True spirit of iGEM lies not in competition but in collaboration. With dawn of synthetic biology,

it became absolutely clear that future of biological sciences lies not in closed gate patenting but 

in open source innovation. iGEM teams all over the world organize team meetups with other 

teams where discussion, critique and feedback over the each team project is given by all. Such 

discussions are extremely helpful as they provide a wide diversity of opinions and filter the 

subtle nuisances before Giant Jamboree. Our team was invited for two iGEM meetups ­ one 

Indian iGEM team meetup by IISER Pune and other an Asian regional meetup organized by 

NCTU, Taiwan. Both of the experiences have been very informative as well as enlightening. 

Details of individual meetups are described below.

 			</DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description"><H3>IISER Pune Meetup (July 16-­17, 2015)</H3>
The IISER Pune iGEM team organized an Indian iGEM meetup during This meetup had

three of the four Indian iGEM teams (for the year 2015) participate in it, namely IIT Delhi, 

IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. IIT Delhi had sent three representatives of their team, while two 

of our team members ­ Harsheel and Rhushikesh represented our team there. During the first day 

(16th July), there was an informal discussion session among all the teams, followed by IISER 

Pune’s project presentation in the afternoon. While the second day (17th July) had the 

presentations of our team (in the morning) and IIT Delhi’s presentation in the afternoon.

IISER Pune made a really comprehensive presentation, which left the entire audience in

awe, and in a way left the other teams with no choice but to further improvise their presentations. 

All the IISER Pune team members participated and contributed to their extensive presentation, 

which had a significant amount of their project modelling data as well (computer simulation 

based work). They had also covered good ground with regard to their wet lab work, and had it 

divided into three sub-­parts, each handling a particular aspect of the wet lab work. While IISER 

Pune wishes to compete in the Health and Medicine track of iGEM, IIT Delhi wishes to compete 

in the environment track. IIT Delhi also made a very descriptive presentation of their idea, which 

was appreciated by the audience. After each of the team presentations (which typically lasted 

about an hour), there were question-answer sessions held, where the clarity and idea of each of 

the teams’ projects were scrutinized.


Very useful suggestions and points were raised for each of the teams post their

presentations, and all the discussions (both formal and informal) were very productive and 

propitious for the teams, in general. We learnt a lot about iGEM through this meetup, got to meet 

a lot of people, and are confident that the advice and suggestions given during this meetup would 

definitely help us give this first attempt at iGEM our best shot. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description"><H3>NCTU Meetup (July 19-­23, 2015)</H3>   
This was the third time NCTU organized its own meetup, and this time, it kept it open for all the 

Asian iGEM teams. It was organized on a pretty grand scale with 30 teams (from countries like 

Taiwan, China, India, etc) participating in it. The two Indian teams participating in this meetup 

were IISER Pune and IIT Kharagpur. The option was given to teams to either go and attend the 

meetup in person, or to present their ideas via video conferencing (Skype). Accordingly, our 

team went ahead with the second option, and was allocated a video conference slot for the 

evening (Taiwan Time) of the third day of the NCTU Meetup (21st July). 

The main idea behind our team’s participation in this meetup was to get advice and 

suggestions from experienced iGEM teams with regard to our project ­ wet lab, policy and 

practices (social outreach, meetups, collaborations, lab visits), modelling and so on. The format 

of the online conference was 20 minutes for the presentation and 20 minutes for the question and 

answer session. Harsheel, one of the senior members of our team gave the presentation of our 

project idea, and the questions that followed (which were pitched by the audience gathered at the 

seminar room in NCTU, Taiwan) were tackled by some of the senior members of the team, as a 

whole. Very valid questions were raised by the audience, and many useful suggestions were 

given with regard to how we could improvise our presentation for the Giant Jamboree, and tackle 

each of the factors (taken into account by the iGEM judges), so as to give our first time 

participation in iGEM the best we have. This meetup was indeed a great learning experience, and 

has geared us up for the grand finale at Boston! 
 			</DIV></DIV><H2 id="surveys">Surveys</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description">
 iGEM mandates organizing of surveys as public outreach practice for all participating teams and

for a good reason. Advancements in Biotechnology in recent years have created a buzz in 

blogger communities, newspaper reports and science and technology television shows. A lot of 

ideas have faced severe opposition on grounds of ethics, religion and simply uninformed 

knowledge. Rise of GMOs in agriculture and medical care brought forward debate on the table 

where many raised rejection of these products because of unfamiliar nature and impact of 

convoluted ideas presented in scientific fiction. Since all iGEM teams are tinkering with the 

biological entities to manufacture artificial life forms which can perhaps be in future transferred 

as a routinely used technological platform like smartphones, computers and internet. It is 

important that public’s opinion be sought, their contributions considered and their information 

gap improved.
Inspired by a plethora of surveys conducted by previous iGEM teams we developed some ideas

of our own. Since our project is based upon development of a household level device capable of 

detecting microbial food spoilage which itself functions upon a synthetic bacteria (an improved 

strain of E.coli DH alpha). The improvement is attributed to introduction of a single plasmid 

possessing a luxR-­AHL quorum sensing detection system which upon presence of AHL (Acyl Homoserine Lactones) 

beyond threshold level initiated the transcription of reporter gene and thus determining if food 

product in question is spoilt or not.

We launched <B>two surveys</B>. One of them essentially focused on <B>Food Spoilage </B>, and the second survey was aimed at gathering data to <B>help newbie iGEM </B>teams get the necessary information to get ready for future participation in iGEM. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description"><H3> Food Spoilage Survey</H3>
                        
Our first survey was in the form of a questionnaire to know how often people face the problem of food spoilage and what solution they take to deal with that. This data will help us to modify and optimize our product accordingly. We received an overwhelming number of responses for this survey (&gt;450). Based on the information collected, we also performed the following series of statistical analyses to draw critical and relevant inferences from the point of view of a sustainable and efficient implementation of our project idea.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6 survey-div grid cs-style-4"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><SPAN>If we told you we can create artificial organism to detect food spoilage in dairy and meat

&quot;Great survey!would be very useful ,if installed in food stores like McDonald's and

kfc etc. Good luck!&quot;

&quot;It is a good concept&quot;

&quot;Your initiative is good.it is very useful to all obviously.&quot;

&quot;It is a great initiative. Let's hope it solves the problem of food spoilage.&quot;

&quot;Good luck iGEM team for your upcoming short innovation&quot;

&quot;Bio­strip to detect food spoilage! seems to be a great and innovative idea.&quot;

&quot;Its very good idea. We should fund this. Keeping in mind it should be affordable to everyone.&quot;

&quot;Well 1st of all great work you guys are doing. Proud of you guys as an alum of Biotech, IIT Kgp.&quot;</I></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description" style="margin-top:20px"><H3 style="margin-top:-10px;">Suggestions</H3><I>
&quot;I wouldn't buy a detector, as I never had problems with spoiled food not being identifiable as

spoiled.&quot;

&quot;As a food technologist I haven't heard about this. If food processors can put expiry date then what 

different can GMO do? why will consumers pay extra? Consumer acceptance can be a big 

problem in India.&quot;

&quot;Be specific in detecting fungal/bacterial spoilage. Because most of our food of acidic nature is 

damaged by fungal partners and food with high water activity by bacterial members. So, target a 

specific group that covers wide food products.&quot;

&quot;First of all would you pack the spoilage detector in the food packages before being purchased by 

consumers? Or would you have a spoilage detector for individual consumer's detection for 

example after opening of the food package? Would it be safe to use? How about disposal? 

Regarding the iGEM Groningen design in 2012: How would you make an applicable, useful and 

simple detector for food e.g. in the fridge? If you put your detector into the fridge at time 0, how 

fast would you know if the food is spoiled or not, regarding the design of your detector. E.g. 

bacteria based detector needs bacteria to grow and produce certain compound resulting in the 

detectable colour. Would the lower temperature have an effect on the time of compound 

production and therefore the spoilage detection? For the best results at the competition, rethink 

and discuss your application strategy with as many people as possible. Take the critique of the 

design and try to make it better. Be prepared to answer all of those questions and to defend your 

application design at the Jamboree (judges are very straightforward with the questions). Good 

luck with the project! Regards from Tjaša, Wageningen 2014 BananaGuard.&quot;

&quot;Well 1st of all great work u guys are doing. proud of u guys as an alum of Biotech, IIT Kgp. &quot;If 

there was an easy, quick and trustworthy biological food spoilage detector how much will you 

spend to buy it?&quot; I am confused­ Are u talking about the machine replaceable strips. Please 

mention. All the best and jeetkeana....&quot;

&quot;I wouldn't pay a cent to buy something that will let me know if something is spoiled or not. In 

my experience (I cook), I have till date been able to detect if a food is gone bad or not pretty 

effectively. A strip or any other innovation on this arena, I think will not do any good as it is in 

fact, redundant. Nature has already done this for us. All you're doing is appealing to the eyes, 

which I believe would not really serve the purpose.&quot; </I></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description" style="margin-top:20px"><H3>Guide the Beginners (Second Survey)</H3>
Participating in iGEM is always a challenge, especially if a team is doing it for the first time. There are a lot of logistical, financial and technical issues among many other grueling challenges that the teams face when they start out. Being beginners, we ourselves have faced many of these problems. 

Hence, our second survey was targeted at the experienced iGEM teams across the world. By means of this survey, we planned to reach out to, and help those iGEM teams which are first-time participants and those students who plan to participate in the coming editions of iGEM. The data collected from this survey will help these teams get an idea of the challenges involved and the solutions adopted by experienced teams to tackle them and successfully conquer them. The ultimate objective of this survey is to encourage even more participation for iGEM in its future editions! 

Based on the questions asked in the survey, some of the nice answers we received were as follows.<OL><LI><B>From your experience, what makes iGEM awesome?</B>
Brainstorming to come up with ideas using theoretical knowledge and converting it into a feasible product that serves to the community issues all without any prior experience gives a lot to learn. Furthermore reading about the ideas of other iGEM teams gives a whole new dimension to the thought process. </LI><LI><B>If you were a member of the organizing team of iGEM, what changes would you like to bring about in the competition structure and why?</B>

The competition is quite expensive; cost needs to be reduced in order for more teams to be able to participate and to increase budget for science as opposed to travel.</LI><LI><B>Has your participation in iGEM brought about any changes in your perspective? If yes, how?</B>

Yes! It helped me understand how Biotechnology can be applied to cater different needs and to explain certain phenomenon. Moreover I have started taking curriculum seriously and started liking the class.</LI><LI><B> In your opinion, how can synthetic biology be an effective tool in affecting our lives and our future?</B>

Synthetic biology can be used for production optimization in industries (like making ammonia though microbes which otherwise is a very harsh and energy consuming process-Haber's process ). Making low cost and highly effective products. Microbes can be viewed as miniature machines which are programmed by nature. Its ready-made and all we need to do is just provide the fuel (conditions and nutrients) and it will take care of the rest. So, employing them will surely affect our lives.</LI><LI><B>What are the problems you faced during your first-time participation and how did you solve them (in brief)?</B>

Finding a project was hard. In retrospect, I think we should have kept it a bit simpler than trying to find a project in literature. Thinking about a problem without thinking of possible limitations is something we probably should have done back when we started out with iGEM.</LI><LI><B>Does iGEM help in improving international collaboration?</B>

Yes, through various teams collaborating with one another and making their ideas open to everyone, it is improving international collaboration.</LI><LI><B>Do you believe that in your country the awareness about synthetic biology has improved enough to consider it as a mainstream science?</B> 

No, I think that synthetic biology and the creation of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) is still very confusing and scary for the general public in the United States.</LI><LI><B>How do you raise funds to participate in iGEM? How difficult is it to get funds from the sponsors?</B>
We raise funds mainly from the colleges at our university's discretionary funds; other funds come from life and biotechnology companies who support us with in kind supply donations or small monetary donations. It is relatively difficult for us to get sponsors, so each year we try to contact as many people as possible in order to increase our chances of finding willing sponsors.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV><H2 id="interviews">Interviews:</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 project-description"><H3>Prof. Hari Niwas Mishra</H3>
On the 3rd of September, three of our team members interviewed an eminent faculty

member of IIT Kharagpur, <B>Prof. Hari Niwas Mishra of the Department of Agriculture and 

Food  Engineering</B>,  who  is  an  expert  in  the  field  of  Health  Foods  &amp;  Nutraceuticals, 

Innovative Food Processing Technologies  and Food Safety &amp; Quality Control. This  is 

how it went:<B>Team:</B> Sir  you  have  been  working  in  this  field  for  about  21  years...can  you  tell  us  about  the 

statistics of food spoilage in the country...like how much wood gets wasted every year due to 

spoilage?<B>Professor Mishra:</B> You  see,  a  few  days  ago  i  was reading  in  the  news reports  that  ICAR (Indian 

Council of Agricultural Research) conducted a recent study in association with CIPHET (Central 

Institute  of  Post-­Harvest  Engineering  and  Technology),  which  involved  a  survey  to  assess 

spoilage  incurred  in  food  storage,  handling,etc. According  to  the report,  4­8%  of  food  grains, 

and 15­-18% of perishables get destroyed every year due to food spoilage.<B>Team:</B> Can  you  tell  us  about  the  various  techniques  that  are  currently  available  for  detection  of 

food spoilage?<B>Professor Mishra:</B> there  are  old  traditional  techniques  which  include  various  types  of  plating 

methods,  and  techniques  to  obtain  microbial  counts  which  have  been  in  use  since  decades. 

Among the new methods, electronic sensor­ based techniques are more prevalent. Nowadays, 

biological  kits,  for  detecting  specific  pathogenic  microbes  like  salmonella  are  also  available. 

HiMedia is one such company making biochemical test kits.<B>Team:</B> The  acceptability  of  GMOs  by  the  public  is  often  seen  as  an  issue  when  a  genetically 

engineered product is released in the market. What are your views regarding the acceptability of 

our product, if commercialized?<B>Professor Mishra:</B> There  has  always  been  a  big  divide  in  the  Indian  society  when  it  comes  to 

acceptance of any genetically engineered product. Equal groups of people are willing to accept 

and  equal  groups  are  against  it.  Most  are  concerned  regarding  the  safety  of  the  product, 

whether it has any side effects or not, since that has never been established in a solid manner 

in the past. If somehow we can establish that our product is absolutely SAFE for consumer use, 

then we can surely think of a long ­term capture of the market.<B>Team:</B> How do  you propose we  can  solve these issues regarding acceptability of our product, if 

released?<B>Professor Mishra::</B> We first need to analyse what the consumers want from our product. As in most of 

the  food  products,  it  is  the  economic  and  nutritional  benefits  that  they  look  for...and 

simultaneously the product must be safe to use continuously. These days, due to high level of 

adulteration in food products, consumers are always in an apprehending mode and try to avoid 

new products. But the change has to come at some point. For that, they have to be convinced 

aptly.<B>Team:</B> Do  you  think  that  our  product  can  be  easily  incorporated  into  the  food  quality  control 

industry, given the available practices in that field? what industries can we target?<B>Professor Mishra:</B> yeah, concept­wise, it appears OK. But still those people need to know the exact 

details of how it works, the pros and cons, disposal issues (if any), which are the substrates on 

which it works best and several other factors. The stability and user­friendliness of the product 

are of utmost importance while deciding its integration into the market. You can target the local 

companies manufacturing analytical instruments at first...they are the ones which  can try and 

introduce  your product at a  small level and then increase  your influence gradually. Eg. Alpha 

moss, Novozymes, Fox, etc.

Some of our team members had a discussion with Professor Ritwik Kumar Layek of the Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering Department of IIT Kharagpur. We concluded that there are some enzyme parameters and other enzyme reaction kinetics data which has to be searched from existing literature. 

We got to know about some platforms from where we can build our concepts on system engineering and mathematical modelling.

The workshop at IGE was aimed at spreading the concept of synthetic biology and awareness about 

iGEM. The students were quite enthusiastic and were eagerly interacting during and after the 

workshop. We also got a chance to visit their labs and see their work. Most of the students were 

new to the concept of synthetic biology and hence, were curious to know about its aspects and 

scope as a research field. Our workshop was followed by a presentation by an M.Sc student of that 

college, on the topic of synthetic biology only. After the two presentations, we had a fruitful 

discussion with the students and the professors. They were appreciating our project and were giving 

valuable suggestions. We told them that we wish to see an iGEM team from their college within the 

next few years. They were quite welcoming regarding the participation in iGEM. After the workshop, 

we had a discussion with one of the professors regarding the problem of food spoilage and it’s 

solutions. We also visited his lab to see his work. He was quite overwhelmed to see our participation 

in iGEM. He insisted us to keep in contact with their students, so that they can also participate in 

iGEM within the next few years. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 project-description" style="margin-top:20px"><H3>Balarampur High School</H3>
 Some of our team members went to Balarampur High school to spread awareness regarding food 

spoilage and synthetic biology among high school students. The students were already aware with 

the concept of Genetics and were fast in catching up. Our team members explained them about 

food spoilage and it’s causes. They were taught about synthetic biology and it’s uses in addressing 

food spoilage. The guide book designed by our team came in very handy to teach them and it also 

served the purpose to clear their doubts on various related topics. The students were quite 

enthusiastic regarding the whole concept of gene manipulation. Our members were following quite 

an interesting and fun-loving way to teach the students. The students were also taught about some 

ways to prevent food spoilage at their homes. The class lasted for about 1 hour and our members 

were very successful in converting a boring lecture class into an interactive session for the students.
