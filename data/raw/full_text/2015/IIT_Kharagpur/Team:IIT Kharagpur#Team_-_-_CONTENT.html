                  Hello! We, the iGEM team of IIT Kharagpur, are a team of
                  enthusiastic biotechnologists in training. A mixed group of students of all
                  ages, we strive towards the common goal of competing with the most
                  brilliant young minds in the field while evolving our own knowledge and
                  helping out make the world a slightly better place in the process.
                  All of us belong to the same discipline of biotechnology with diverse
                  specializations, and we are from the Indian Institute of Technology
                  Kharagpur, located in West Bengal, India. Though we share a common
                  interest and discipline, the group itself is quite diverse and the contribution
                  of each person is needed to make things happen. Our group is dedicated
                  and we don't mind burning the midnight oil or sidelining our vacations if
                  that's what it takes.

                  We have been fortunate in our guides who have been patient
                  and extremely supporting. We may have started out late, but
                  we have high expectations from our team both with regard to
                  the competition and ourselves. It's a learning experience why
                  we won't have fun all the same!

                    Hailing from one of the four metros, Mumbai, Harsheel is
                    our prime coordinator. Now a fourth year student, he says
                    that fate has got him to this field. He is an enthusiastic
                    guy who is always up for the challenge. Initially hesitant
                    to venture into this field of synthetic biology, he says
                    that after seeing its immense potential and the importance
                    of its applications,  he has never looked back. He believes
                    that synthetic biology is the platform through which
                    genetic engineering, man's gift to the world of biology, is
                    put to test.

                    of project - content development, media articles, and
                    literature research.

                    concept of evolution, he thinks that it is much more exciting to study the systems that are a
                    result of millions of years of continuous and successful evolutions rather than those which have
                    been around for the past few decades.

                    research by the idea that there is enormous potential left untouched in every form of life, just
