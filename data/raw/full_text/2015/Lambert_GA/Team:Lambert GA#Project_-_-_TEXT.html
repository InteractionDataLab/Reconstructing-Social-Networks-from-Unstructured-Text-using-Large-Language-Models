Project
OVERVIEW
The Lambert High School iGEM team from Suwanee, Georgia is a group of dedicated and self described nerds who love the challenges of doing science. We set out to further our work from our previous year’s project, as we never had the chance to express our protein, chitin deacetylase.
During the year 2013 we isolated the chitin deacetylase gene, CDA2 from Sacchromyces cerevesai. Studies have shown that this gene could be expressed in E.coli successfully. Martinou, A., D. Koutsioulis, and V. Bouriotis. 2003)  CDA breaks down chitin, a naturally occurring polysaccharide into chitosan. Chitosan is widely used in a multitude of industries; including agriculture, aquaculture, health, biofilm production and water treatment. Current methods of Chitosan production use strong acids and bases to deacetylate the chitin, these may be cost effective at the moment, but the waste is incredibly harsh on the environment and is not sustainable. Our idea was to engineer cells to accomplish this task. The cells could be grown and used in a bioreactor, producing acetic acid as a waste product, which also has useful industrial applications. Current industries that produce chitosan are often located near coastal areas due to the natural abundance of shrimp shells and other exoskeletons. Unfortunately the wastewater form production can be polluting to the fragile ecosystems.
Chitosan has antifungal and antibacterial properties. We needed to engineer a system where we could turn on and off CDA production in such a way as to not kill our host cells. To this end we designed several constructs that would direct expression to the periplasm using a pelB tag combined with a Tet repressible promoter. We added GFP to the construct so that we might be able to visualize the proper expression in the periplasm. We also wanted to engineer a kill switch by incorporating 2013 Carnegie-Mellon's Killer Red   BBa_K1184000.  This would enable an environmental safety switch in our cells.
After research and discussion with our mentoring team and Dr. Styczynski at the Georgia Institute of Technology, we chose a threefold approach to the design. Sometimes large engineered proteins have difficulty folding properly in the periplasm so we needed to address the issue using different placement of promoters.
The first design we call the bicistronic construct. We engineered the pelB tag and CDA under TetR promotion and the GFP under a lac inducible promoter. Having only the pelB tag and CDA in the periplasm would hopefully eliminate the difficulty with a 2000bp gene folding properly in the space. The GFP as a reporter would just let us know our transformations were successful and we could choose colonies for colony PCR using the color selection. The introduction of two independent genes however could have been a drain on the cell leading to early cell death.
The second design of the bidirectional is a way to use just a repressible promoter of TetR, but have the transcription of the two genes occur independently in opposite directions. There are several commercial plasmids that use bidirectional promoters to accomplish multi gene expression. This construct proved very problematic as we were ordering the gBlocks from IDT. Because the back to back promoter sequences were likely to form hairpin structures we had to order this in two parts using a multiple cloning site as a linker between the two TetR promoters.
The last construct of our project was a fusion protein consisting pf the pelB leader sequence, CDA and GFP all under the promotion of one TetR promoter. The benefit we aimed for with this sequence would be the ability to visualize the GFP in the periplasm of the cells. The large size though of the protein could lead to folding difficulties and then a complete loss of expression of either genes; CDA or GFP.
Our project, if successful, could lead to two significant advances, the first being a more environmentally friendly way to produce chitosan. Using engineered E.coli cells, we named Chitinite, to create to useful products of chitosan and acetic acid from waste shrimp shells would help save coastal ecosystems. A second significant contribution to science is our Biobricked bidirectional promoter system. This can help scientists with dual gene expression.
Another highlight of our efforts was a Discovery Dialogue held in partnership with the Atlanta Science Festival. We brought together on one stage, in an open forum; a legislator, ethicist, immunologist, FBI agent and scientist. The public was invited to ask questions and the concluding polls showed both an increase in the positive perception of synthetic biology, but also a request to hold another session this coming year.

RESULTS
Mature CDA2 gene that was inserted into the pSB1C3 plasmid was transformed into NEB 10 beta E. coli cells. They were placed onto chloramphenicol plates to grow but it yielded no results.
Tested transformation efficiency of NEB 10 beta E. coli cells with iGEM transformation efficiency kits. RFP was inserted into pSB1C3 and transformed into NEB 10 beta E. coli cells and grown on chloramphenicol plates. RFP was expressed in the colonies. RFP was subsequently used to test our foldscope.
Ligation of our constructs into pSB1C3 and pSB1T3 plasmids was carried out and they were transformed with NEB 10 beta E. coli and then placed on chloramphenicol and tetracycline plates respectively to grow. The chloramphenicol transformations were successful and the plates grew colonies. However, the tetracycline transformations did not yield growth. Transformations were carried out again for the pSB1T3 plasmids but again they yielded no results. The colonies on the chloramphenicol plates were taken and grown on liquid cultures, mini prepped and then ran on the gel to find the base pair length of the DNA. Due to the fact that the pSB1C3 plasmid had a similar base pair length with our constructs, the gel was inconclusive. (pSB1C3 has a base pair length of 2070 bp, Fusion construct is 1828 bp, Bidirectional construct is 2118 bp, and Bicistronic construct is 1929 bp and so the base pair length of the constructs could have been covered up by the plasmid base pair length.)
