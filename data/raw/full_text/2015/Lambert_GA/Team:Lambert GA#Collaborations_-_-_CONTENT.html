Over the summer, our Lambert iGEM team visited Georgia Tech and with the current Georgia Tech iGEM team. During our visit, we presented and explained our project and they, along with Dr.Styczynski and Dr. Liangjun Zhao, were able to give us advice.  We used these pointers to design our project.   In particular, they helped eliminate some projects that would have not worked at all in the scope of our timeframe, including a CRISPR cas reporter for Wheat Stripe rust.  They played a major role in assisting us with our initial construct ideas. We used the IDT offer of gBlocks to order several different constructs.  In turn, we had the privilege of listening to their project as well. We asked questions about their designs and discussed our experiences at the Collegiate Jamboree in 2013 and 2014.  This was valuable to them as members of their team had not been to a Jamboree before. Lastly, the team led us on a tour of the new Engineered Biosystems building and labs.  Without this type of collaboration, it would be impossible for our team to have as successful of a project. </P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>The whole group</TH><TH>Serious Discussion</TH></TR><TR><TH>Dr. Liangjun Zhao</TH><TH>Lambert iGEM gazes longingly at Georgia Tech's vastly superior lab equipment</TH></TR><TR><TH>Wondering how we can afford this kind of lab
