We are an after-school club that meets simply for the love of synthetic biology, serious swag, and with an initiative to save the environment one gene at a time. </P></CENTER><H2 style="text-align:center"> STUDENTS </H2><DIV class="student"><H3>NEHA BALACHANDRAN</H3><P>Hi, I'm Neha and I'm a junior at Lambert High School!

For fun I enjoy running, dancing, reading, and playing the guitar.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>LILY GE</H3><P>I'm a senior at Lambert who's been with iGEM since the dawn of time. A brief list of things I love: open source science, number theory proofs, ballet (and Maria Kotchekova), fencing, flowers, art and graphic design, the internet, roller coasters, libraries, late night conversations.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>LAUREN HONG</H3><P>My name is Lauren Hong, and I am currently a sophomore at Lambert High School. Through iGEM, I've been able to explore the power of biology to apply the concepts to our own ideas and designs. Outside of the lab, I'm a competitive soccer player and a passionate violinist.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>CHRIS JACKSON</H3><P>Hi, my name is Chris Jackson, and I'm a sophomore on the Lambert iGEM team. I have helped with the foldscope aspect of our project, and am a student athlete who plays baseball and tennis. I like animals more than people.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>JACK KWON </H3><P>Hi! My name is Jack Kwon and I am one of the members on the Lambert High School iGEM team. I am very interested in the field of biology and plan on pursuing it in college. iGEM has allowed me to experience labs in the high school setting which is very cool and hope to benefit more from being part of the iGEM team!</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>JULIA LEVEILLE</H3><P>I’m Julia Leveille, a sophomore, and this is my first year on iGEM.

My life belongs to the One who redeemed my soul, to my husband who stole my heart, to my parasitic offspring whom I adore and would sacrifice everything for, to my amazing students who keep me young. All I ask for is a small part of the day to release some endorphins in a thirty minute workout and a little bit of clean, iGEM green kale juice to keep me going!</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><H3>BRITTNEY CANTRELL</H3><P>If it involves coffee, campfires, tacos or dinosaurs, I'm in! A perfect day is one spent sharing my love for science with my freshmen who have affectionately been deemed my squirrels.

Free time is spent in the mountains hiking and backpacking with my sweet husband and two fur babies.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sponsors-bottom"><P>
