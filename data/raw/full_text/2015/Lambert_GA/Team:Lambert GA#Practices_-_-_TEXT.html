Human Practices
As a team, we strongly believe in the importance of giving back to our local community as a thanks for all that we have received. Here are some ways we have done so:
Foldscope

Microscopes are near-ubiquitous in science, especially in the field of synthetic biology. Unfortunately, microscopes are very costly and often inaccessible to labs with limited funding. Many labs, especially high school labs, are often greatly hindered in their pursuit of scientific knowledge by lack of this crucial instrument. Enter the Foldscope: an origami based microscope that can be mass produced at very low costs. These microscopes are capable to work as fluorescent, brightfield, and darkfield microscopes. The origami along with the brilliant optical design by Dr. Manu Prakash of Stanford University enables high volume fabrication of microscopes from a few lenses and a sheet of paper. The origami design creates flexure mechanisms that allows the final product to have a flat, compact design. Additionally, the preassembled Foldscope fits neatly on a standard sheet of paper so it can be easily handled. The Foldscope can survive harsh field conditions and still provide various imaging capabilities. This instrument has many applications for a low-cost, portable microscope. Lambert iGEM has incorporated the Foldscope into this year's project by engineering additional capabilities for the current Beta models.  We designed filters to turn the Foldscope into a Fluorescent microscope.  The ability to visualize GFP or other fluorescent proteins would incredibly helpful to other scientists who work in impoverished labs.  To transform the standard Foldscope into a fluorescent microscope, we layered Roscolux filters over a halogen lamp. Although the current magnification or the lens makes visualizing bacteria problematic, we feel this is an interesting to avenue to keep exploring
Atlanta Science Festival
Discovery Dialogue
The Panelists and iGEM team
Panelists in Discussion
Reception afterward
The Atlanta Science Festival is a three day celebration of science.  Lambert's iGEM team was proud to be chosen as a partner of the event.  We held a Discovery Dialogue entitled Synthetic Biology that was open to the public.  The panelists included a FBI agent, State Legislator, Immunologist from the CDC, Biologist who serves on the Ethics board at Emory University and Professor of Chemical Engineering.
The varying perspectives led to a lively discussion led by the students.  Topics ranged from genetic engineering in research labs, ethics of genetic engineering, biological weapons,  agriculture, bioterrorism and GMO labeling among others.  The public took part in a question and answer session as well.  The attendees were polled prior to and again when leaving about their attitudes towards synthetic biology.  More than 60% stated at the beginning that they were hesitant to approve the science of genetic engineering. After the panel discussion that dropped to just under 19%.  The Discovery Dialogue was such a success that Lambert's team has been asked to partner with the Atlanta Science Festival with a longer event.  Based on the feedback we received from the participants during this coming year, 2016, we are putting together a 1/2 day event that will include sessions: focused on agricultural use of synthetic biology, health and medicinal therapies and panel discussing the safety of synthetic biology.
Around 20 of our iGem members helped make the panel at Atlanta Science Festival go smoothly. The Atlanta Science Festival brings together people spanning multiple generations, from all walks of life. A stereotype exists that the older generation is ignorant to new technologies, but that does not necessarily equate to an unwillingness to learn. One of the more notable attendees of our Discovery Dialogue, an older woman approximately in her mid 60’s, was deeply concerned by the topic brought up regarding genetically modified apples that were altered to avoid browning. She vehemently debated against the modification of fruits because of the perceived notion that the taste of her beloved apples was greatly altered, along with all of the fruits since her childhood. With the panel of experts, as well as the LHS iGEM student’s input, we were able to help her come to the realization that the differences in agricultural production was not only the possible impact of GMOs, but also included modern transportation methods in the industry. This is just one example of how our panel at the Atlanta Science Festival helped to break down the misrepresentation of SynBio in the community.

Topics of Discission
General
How do genetically modified organisms (GMOs) pertain to the work or research that you do?
What are some government policies and/or regulations that you have encountered regarding GMOs?
What safety measures should be in place to regulate the proliferation of GMOs, if any?
Should GM foods be labeled?
What are the possible repercussions of mass production and distribution of GM foods?
Science
What are some potential benefits GMOs can have in science?
How has government interference hindered scientific development?
How widely used are GMOs today in the laboratory setting?
Government
The United States has proposed analyzing genetic information from more than 1 million American volunteers as part of a new initiative to understand human disease and develop medicines targeted to an individual's genetic make-up. What critical ethical boundaries may arise from such a program? Should a human's genome be subject to privacy regulation, adequately protected from person to person? If so, to what degree?
Public Safety
What is your opinion about the ever-increasing accessibility to manipulating biological organisms?
What safety measures should be in place to regulate the proliferation of GMOs, if any?
Society
How accurate is society’s perception of GMOs, and what should we do to correct any misunderstandings?
Next Generation Focus
Isolating DNA from Strawberries
This year, Lambert iGEM continued our partnership with the "Next Generation Focus" program (NGF). NGF promotes the importance of education and specifically targets underprivileged children in the community. Through our partnership, Lambert iGEM focuses on providing engaging scientific enrichment activities for children traditionally underrepresented in the STEM fields. By exposing kids to interesting hands-on activities not offered in their classrooms, we present science as more than a series of facts to memorize and strive to spark a lifelong love of science. We spend a few Saturdays per semester at NGF hosting their "Science Days" to teach the fundamentals. Kids participate in activities such as cell diagramming, anatomy games, and even chromatography. Many of these young students would not have had the additional enrichment and scientific education without NGF. The high achieving, passionate science students that volunteer and drive this program serve as role models for the kids.
Keep Charlie Moving
Sharing our fundraising efforts
Enjoying our friendship
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disease that affects 1 in 3,600 boys.  We raised $600 for a local charity, “Keep Charlie Moving”, which helps to raise funds for a fellow Lambert student who has this disease.  Because of this donation, he was able to travel to another state and receive treatment from a specialist.  It is our hope that, someday, through techniques of synthetic biology, we will be able to cure genetic diseases.
Operation Christmas Child
Our shopping efforts
Our team also raised money for another local charity, Operation Christmas Child.  We went out and gathered donations to give to a family that we sponsored at Christmas.  In the package of gifts, we included a small educational microscope set - hopefully we will inspire a future scientist!
Lab Hacks:
Lab Hacks are little things we have found to help us as a high school team that doesn't have easy access to many expensive lab materials. They are very small changes to everyday lab procedures that produce just as effective results. Here are some we have used over the years, and we hope they help you as well!
Water Bath
Rubber Bands, the Best
From the side
Problem:Our team does not have brackets for our shaking water bath. This is a problem because it did not all us to secure it well enough to be able to incubate overnight.
Solution: We noticed the holes at the bottom of the shaking water bath's tray that are meant for the wingnuts to be secured. Instead of purchasing the expensive brackets (that don't fit correctly, since we have one small set)- we found that a configuration of rubber bands works much better and is much more secure. All you need to do is secure them to the bottom using two holes and pulling each end of a single rubber band through two close holes. You then pull one end through the loop of the other to secure. Continue doing this until you have four points of contact to the base and can then work on securing the glassware to the base using more rubber bands.
Blue Ice
Visualizing the Tubes
Problem: When using clear microcentrifuge tubes or PCR tubes, the transparent plastic can get lost amongst the white ice/Styrofoam.
Solution: It is a simple solution to this frustrating problem- color the ice. One drop of blue food dye per 1L of water creates vibrant blue ice that can be easily differentiated from the tubes during wet lab work. It is also very helpful to have ice with a hole/dip in the middle to place tubes as opposed to strictly shaved ice (which runs the risk of diluting your solutions).
Keeping PCR Tubes Cold
Using an Ice shaver
PCR tube in shaved ice
Problem:As a high school lab, we don't have an ice block for our PCR tubes. This poses a problem because regular shaved ice could easily destroy the precise experiments by dripping melted chips into an open tube.
Solution: We fixed this by taking shaved ice, and packing it into a tray made for microcentrifuge tubes. We then used a single PCR tube to make indentations in the ice to use as a mold. This mold is then frozen for use in the next heat-sensitive lab. (Note: It is recommended that you use the centermost slots during your wet lab to avoid your ice channels from melting too quickly.)
