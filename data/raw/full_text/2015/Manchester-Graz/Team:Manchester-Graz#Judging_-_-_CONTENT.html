		1. Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree. 
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		2. Complete the Judging form. 
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		3. Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. <P style="color:green;">A short description about our project can be found at our  <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Description" target="_blank">Project Description</A> page.

		4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information. 
		</DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		5. Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
		<P style="color:green;">Work done by students can be found at our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Team" target="_blank">Team</A> page.
		Under <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Attributions" target="_blank">Attributions</A> we listed people we worked with to cover different aspects of iGEM.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion" style="margin-bottom:70px;"><DIV class="medaltext">
		6. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page. 
		<P style="color:green;">Our registered BioBricks can be reviewed at our  <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Parts" target="_blank">Parts</A> page.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="medal" style="height:670px;"><H2>Silver</H2><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		1.	Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry  for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. 
		<P style="color:green;">We further characterized all of our registered <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Parts" target="_blank">BioBricks</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		2. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.) 
		<P style="color:green;">From our registered and characterized BioBricks, we submitted 8 to the registry:<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670001" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670001</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670002" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670002</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670003" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670003</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670004" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670004</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670006" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670006</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670007" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670007</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670008" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670008</A><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1670009" target="_blank"> BBa_K1670009</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion" style="margin-bottom:70px;"><DIV class="medaltext">
		3.	iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. <B>Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.</B> (See the Human PracticesHub for more information.)
		<P style="color:green;">Questions beyond the bench were asked and answered in our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Practices" target="_blank">Human Practices</A> page.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="medal" style="height:600px;"><H2>Gold</H2><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		1.	Choose one of these two options: <B>(1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity</B> by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. <B>OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project</B> (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the <U>Human Practices Hub</U> for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams). 
		<P style="color:green;">We strongly believe that our work done on <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Practices" target="_blank">Human Practices</A>, having huge input in the project shaping, exceeds Silver Medal criteria and makes us eligible for Gold Medal.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		2.	Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
		<P style="color:green;">We participated in multiple <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Collaborations" target="_blank">Collaborations</A> in key areas such as modelling and human practices.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		3.	Improve the <B>function</B> OR characterization of a <B>previously existing</B> BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see the <U>Registry Contribution help page</U> for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your team's 2015 range of part numbers.
		<P style="color:green;">We improved and further characterized the function of BioBricks <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E0020" target="_blank">BBa_E0020</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part: BBa_K1362461" target="_blank">BBa_K1362461</A>, as seen on our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Description" target="_blank">Description</A> and <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Manchester-Graz/Project/Results" target="_blank">Results</A> page</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="criterion"><DIV class="medaltext">
		4.	Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember, <U>biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.</U>)
