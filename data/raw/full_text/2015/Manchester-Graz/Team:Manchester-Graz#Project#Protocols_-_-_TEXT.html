Remove the n-butanol (with filter papers) and prepare the stacking gel (4%) (can be prepared after pouring the separation gel; Attention: adding of persulfate and TEMED shortly before pouring the stacking gel)

5. Close the lid (mind the correct arrangement of the electrodes)
6. Run your gels at 125 V. Duration is about 50 min but depends on the size of your proteins.
Stain your gels with coomassie blue for 10 min, then wash with 10 % acetic acid over night.
