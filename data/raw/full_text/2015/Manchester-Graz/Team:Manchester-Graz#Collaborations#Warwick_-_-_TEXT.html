Following several Skype conversations with Warwick iGEM the idea was born to arrange and plan an event together. The Warwick team kindly arranged for all of us to spend a day at Newman College in Oldham where we were able to spark an interest in studying science at university and give the students an introduction to synthetic biology and both of our projects.
We collaborated extensively on planning and designing two presentations which we presented together in five lessons over the course of the day. These presentations not only gave us the chance to convey our passion for science and Synthetic Biology but also allowed us to get an insight into each others iGEM projects.
It was a great experience to speak to teenagers and show them how many things they learn at school are applied in the real world. The feedback we received from both teachers and the students themselves was very positive and confirmed the importance of outreach activites as part of our project. We found it to be especially valulable to plan this event together with Warwick iGEM as it allowed us to share both of our iGEM experiences with the students as well as with each other.
