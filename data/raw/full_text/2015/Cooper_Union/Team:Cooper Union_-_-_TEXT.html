Welcome to the Cooper Union iGEM 2015 Website!
This summer we worked on an exciting new way to synthesize DNA.  Continuing the work of last year's team, we focused on  building a device that could turn their theoretical DNA synthesis model into a reality.  Since this small device would weave together a strand of DNA, we named it Loomino!
Overview
In order to make this DNA synthesizer a reality, we would approach its construction from two angles.  The first would be building the physical device.  This device would need to transfer accurate amounts of fluids in a coordinated manner while also having a thermocycling function so the reactions could be carried out at the optimal temperatures.  We also sought to design and test better enzymes to be used by this device.  Finally, everything is joined together by binding DNA to a glass surface so that our device has a platform to build the DNA molecule
