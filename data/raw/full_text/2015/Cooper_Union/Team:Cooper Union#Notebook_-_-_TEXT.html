JUNE 2015
June 3rd - 8th
Tushar, Chris, Keith, Susung, John, Jean
We designed various truncated and modified TdT sequences using the SnapGene viewer. The sequences were derived from the results documented in a paper by Repasky et. all detailing the Mutational Analysis of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated N-Nucleotide Addition in V(D)J Recombination.
The following sequences were designed: TdT delta1-27 (BBa_K1746000) , TdT delta26-143 (BBa_K1746001) , and TdT GIP 213-215 subAAA (BBa_K1746002) .

We practiced making 1% agarose gels. We immobilized DNA to Dynabeads (following the Dynabead Prep Protocol) and then ran experiments with TdT using regular dATPs and Cleanamp dATPs (following the Dynabead Cleanamp Protocol). We ran a gel of the experiments but saw no results. It is proposed that DNA was lost when removing DNA from Dynabeads.
