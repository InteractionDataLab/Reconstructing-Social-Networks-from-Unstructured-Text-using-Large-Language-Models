Dac Anh
We'd like to thank Dac Anh, a graduate mentor who formerly worked at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, for his assistance on the design of the device. His input allowed us to properly plan for taking the project into the next step, and explained the possibility of using microfluidics to improve on the current model.
Hardware
This part of the project encompasses the physical device. It involves work with fluidics devices, thermocyclers, and circuitry.  Hardware team members closely collaborated to insure that all these different parts would work together
Software
This was the coding part of the project.  It involves coding the arduino to control the loomino device along with designing the team website.
Wetware
The wet work of this project encompassed all genetic engineering components.  TdT based experiments were carried out by these team members.  People who worked on this designed sequences, ran digests and ligations, and transformed bacteria.  All protocols involving preparation of glass slides were grouped with wetware because the skills needed for these protocols better matched the wetware team's specialties.
