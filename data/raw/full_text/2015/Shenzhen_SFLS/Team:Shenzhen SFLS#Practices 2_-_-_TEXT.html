As shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5, Surgical treatment and Chemothrapy are most frequently used methods in cancer therapy. The former is applied in early stage primarily and the latter is primarily applied in Middle Stage and Final Stage, while immunological treatment methods, which we take Monoclonal Antibody Drug as an example of, are mostly used as helpers to the two therapies mentioned above.
We interviewed Doctor Xianming Li who is the Chief of Tumor Radiotherapy Department in Shenzhen Renmin Hospital. Together, we discussed about the major factors which decide the current status of the application of immunological therapies and the view on cancer therapy development. Doctor Li suggested that the immunological therapies currently developed perform well in accuracy. But most of them kill tumor cells less directly compared with surgical treatment and sometimes less aggressive compared with chemotherapy. As a result, immunological methods are mostly used before or after surgical treatments or chemotherapy to enhance the effect. Talking about ADCs, he also shared with us the experience of applying ADCs like drugs to treating a kind of as clinical trails. The treatment turned out to be a failure however due to the uncontrolled high toxicity of the durgs conjugated. Accordingly, Doctor Li pointed out that how to control the toxicity of drugs during drug delivering process and how to reduce undesirable immune system reponses are the two cure problems remained to be solved. When asked about his view on the future prospects of biological cancer therapy, Doctor Li used "absolutely promising" to express his opinion and he also gave suggestions on us choosing effector molecule in our project.

Fig.10 Our Survey designed for Hospitals and the results we received
We finally ended up our investigation in hospitals in visiting the Biological treatment Building in Renmin Hospital which is devoting force in demonstrating the applying possibility of some newly invented cellular immunological therapy.

Further Improvement Blueprints ------Stage 3 The investigation gave us food of thoughts about our project design and project application. Basing on the results, we improved our application blueprints to solve problems we investigated well. The improvements can be viewed at Application. Popularization in public With the gains of knowledge and practical experience in our investigation, we feel like having the responsibility to share all we learned with the public. Therefore, we documented few articles about cancer and cancer therapy to help people learn more about the disease and how to defend it. The articles can be viewed after following our We-chat Public Platform. "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't." We genuinely hope that with our efforts, more people can be willing to face the disease, thus to fight against it together. Especially acknowledge to Shenzhen Renmin Hospital and Shenzhen Second Renmin Hospital for offering data in application survey. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Edited by B.
