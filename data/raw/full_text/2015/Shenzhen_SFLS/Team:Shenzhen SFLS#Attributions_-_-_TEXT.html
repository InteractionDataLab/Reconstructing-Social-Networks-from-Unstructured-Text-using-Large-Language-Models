[Theory Design of “Switchgen”] ———By Yuhe Wu, Yi Zhang, Qixin Lin and Zhaoheng Li
The four members, led by Yuhe Wu did brilliant job in the early stage of forming “Switchgen”, including designing the structure of protein , the design of Protein Engineering and the search for application directions--the ADCs and CAR-T. And the  people are keep working on improving “Switchgen” all the time.
[Experiment and Parts] ——— By Jiazheng Xing, Zhulin Chen,Jiafu Li and Zhengfeng Liu
The experiment for “Switchgen” turned out to be of great difficulties while being carried out. Members in Experiment group,led by Jiazheng Xing, shouldered a lot of pressure but still keep trying and didn’t give up.They designed our confirmatory experiment all-sidedly They managed to construct the”scFV” biobrick and”eGFP-scFV” birobrick.
[Modeling] ——— By Zheshen Gong and Yan Xu
Aiming at helping analyse the results and support the application blueprints, two members in Modeling Group solve out three equations basing on the analysis of the interactions between antigens and antibodies.
[Investigation On Project] ——— By Yilin Wang, Fanghui He
The two members,led by Zheshen Gong improved our project in the way of outreaching to real world and collecting the information of real application landscape. They also conducted survey to look into public cogniton on cancer and cancer therapy.
[Art  Designing] ——— By Wenjing Jiang
Wenjing Jiang is the chief designer of our team. She designed the team uniforms, the team banner and the template of our team’s wiki. She also contributed in designing our team logo and team slogan which will be shown on Giant Jamboree.
[Wiki  Editing] ———By Junhao Cui
Junhao Cui contributed in editing our wiki to show the achievements of our project.
[Sponsors contact] ——— By Chengxing Yang and Dayu Qin

----Boxiang Wang
Boxiang Wang has been our team's advisor for three years.Our members were trained for doing interlab research under his guidance. As for Project Design,he has provided several reference documents on CAR-T for us.Some advice on our ideas is also given by Mr.Wang.
----Zhongnan Yang
Mr.Yang is also an advisor from our school. He has supported us a lot in founding our team and making arrangements for our project.
----Yuying Zhang
As the team leader of Shenzhen_SFLS 2014,Katniss Zhang has inspired us a lot on how to arrange our team routine and human practice activities.The advice she brought to us is quite useful and constructive.
[Instructor] ---Peilin Li
As our instructor, Mr.Li contributed a lot in founding our team this year. He arranged our activity room and has shouldered the responsibility of talking to Experiment Department in order to put forward our project.
