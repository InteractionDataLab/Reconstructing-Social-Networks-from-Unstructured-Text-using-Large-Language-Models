Investigation on cancer and cancer therapy Written by Yilin Wang, survey conducted by Yilin Wang, popularization articles written by Fanghui He As we formed our project in the inspiration of cancer threrapy, we felt that further investigation on cancer and cancer therapy will help us improve our project. We developed our investigation in three stages. In the first stage, we collected some data on the Internet and conducted a survey about public cognition on cancer and cancer therapy. In the second stage, we visited some hospitals and deepened our investigation by doing survey focusing on real clinical application of cancer therapies and interviewed Doctor Xianming Li in Shenzhen Renmin hospital in addition. In the third stage, we improved our detailed application blueprints according to the results of hospital survey and the aim of solving the existing problems in applying ADCs. Additionally, we documented several articles on our We-chat Public Platform, aiming at popularizing the knowledge we gained about cancer and cancer therapy. About cancer ------Stage 1 Cancer has been one of the most formidable enemies human faces. 8 million deaths were related to cancer in 2012 worldwide, together with approximately 14 million new cases diagnosed.  Although China isn't the most affected country by cancer, according to the world incidence rates, its large population and developing public medical services still lead to considerable mortality. In China, cancer accounted for 23.92% of overall deaths in 2010.  And the incidence rate is still growing.

However, besides continuously developing treatment thechnology, peopleâ€™s well cognition on the disease is also required for fighting against the disease. To observe public cogniton on cancer and cancer therapy, we documented our survey on our Wechat Public Platform, an online public platform, and received feedback of an amount of over 600 . The results analyzed are printed below.

Fig.5 The feedback of public cognition on cancer therapy As the results shown, when asked about cancer, most people remain knowing "not so much" or "almost nothing at all". And only 19% of the people surveyed know about technologies beside the three main treatment methods(Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Surgical Treatment), such as targeted therapy and immunological therapy which may perform more promisingly in future application. P.S. Therefore, we developed Stage 3, introducing the frontier technologies in cancer treatment field to popularize knowledge of cancer and cancer to the public. Clinical Application of immunological cancer therapies ------Stage 2 Aiming at looking into the application landscape of cancer therapies, especially the immunological therapies which is related closely to our project, we conduct a survey in two hospitals. By conducting the survey, we collected information about the application frequency of different therapies in treating patients in different stages.
