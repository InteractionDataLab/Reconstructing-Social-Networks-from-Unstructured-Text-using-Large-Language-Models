Extending In July, the founder of BioCurious and inventor of open pcr, Tito Jankowski visited Shenzhen. Our Team is fortunate to have chance to communicate with him at his lecture given at an open lab in Shenzhen called Shenzhen Open Innovation Lab and presented our project. The concept of 'open resource' really stroke us. We started to form our idea of creating a collaborative platform among high school teams to share resource like training courses, lab rescourse and so on. We are still working on realizing the idea and hopefully will have results next year.

Gathering Thoughts To gather thoughts of different teams, we held a iGEM High School Meetup in Shenzhen on August 8th. We invited Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen College of International Education (SCIE,will participate in iGEM next year) and SKLBC-China to the meet up. Every team share their projects with other teams. Then, we discussed about the founding of iGEM teams, the difficulties we have or we are facing, and many other fascinating topics. The three teams also gave a lot of suggestions on working on iGEM to SCIE who will participate in as a new Shenzhen high school team next year.
