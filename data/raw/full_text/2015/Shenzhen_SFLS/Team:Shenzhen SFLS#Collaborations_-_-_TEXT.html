*This year we collaborated with another iGEM high school team in Shenzhen, the SZMS_15_Shenzhen. Besides communication on projects and team founding, we help and assist each other achieving experimental or Modeling goals. We helped them achieve an experimental goal in their experiment “Houyi shoots the sun”part. “Houyi Shoots the Sun” We constructed this system with two different kinds of E. coli bacteria, one representing the sun and  the other representing Houyi. The working mechanism is described in the following: first we transform a plasmid with the serial EC 1.7.7.2 to simulate the sun. EC 1.7.7.2 is a sequence of an enzyme that catalyses an exothermic reaction., causing the E. coli representing the sun to rise its temperature constantly. It should be noted that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 is regulated by LuxI through the QS system. Second, we transformed a plasmid containing LuxI into another kind of E. coli representing Houyi. Due to the fact that the expression of EC 1.7.7.2 can be repressed by the presence of LuxI, the E. coli representing Houyi can effectively lower the temperature of the previously described E. coli with EC 1.7.7.2.
