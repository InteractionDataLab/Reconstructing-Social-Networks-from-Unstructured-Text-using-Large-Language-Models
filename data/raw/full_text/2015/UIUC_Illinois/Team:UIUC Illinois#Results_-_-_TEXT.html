Results:
Despite encountering high levels of mutations throughout our various attempts to make a standardized version of the SCRIBE system, on the final day before our parts were due, we finally saw signs of successful recombination in response to IPTG!
Results that constitute a characterization of our part can be found on its registry page, located here.
Unsuccessful Results:
We were unable to obtain a functional construct of SCRIBE without the lac promoter
Because of this we were unable to carry out our original goal of examining SCRIBE's potential biosensing applications
Future plans:
Add other promoters upstream of the SCRIBE cassette to expand its possible applications, particularly in environmental biosensing applications, such as groundwater contamination.
Combine SCRIBE with the genome-editing tools to function in eukaryotic organisms
Further examine potential mutagenic effects related to the overproduction of msDNA and the impact it may have had on our project [1].
