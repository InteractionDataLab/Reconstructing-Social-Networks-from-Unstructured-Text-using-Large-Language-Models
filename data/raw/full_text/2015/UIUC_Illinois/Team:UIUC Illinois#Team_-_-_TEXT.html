Our Team!
Hi, my name is Caroline! I love doing web lab work and helping with the team's graphic design. Outside of iGEM, I spend my time playing board games and sewing biology-inspired quilts.
Hi, I’m James. I’m a chemical engineering major aspiring to become a synthetic biologist. When I first read about BioBricks, I wondered what it would be like to design some myself. This summer I found out, and it was worth the eleven year wait.
Hi my names Sameer! You can find me protesting against paternalistic paradigms of medicine or wearing patterned shirts scuttling around campus. This is my second year of iGEM and I still haven’t contracted enterocolitis…yet.
Hello, my name is Joshua. You can identify me as the shortest member on the team. I'm also an aspired mainstream hipster, who own a fixie bike, Chrome backpack, and some Levi's 511 jeans. (Definitely should've shaved for the picture.)
Hi, I am Linyang Ju (Andrew), an MCB junior. In addition to eating a hearty meal during a long PCR, I also love to feed those bacterium that cry the most piteously for food and generate electricity to push bands in gel to the correct site.
Hello, my name is Noah. I love long walks on the beach holding hands with the eternal love of my life and listening as the waves crash against sandy beaches tucked within the expanses of my imagination as I day dream through class.
Hello, I'm Miranda Dawson. I helped with wet lab work and organized our outreach project.  Outside of iGEM, I binge watch reality television and indulge in overpriced coffee drinks.
My name is Arudhir (Aru) Singh, I am a junior in Engineering Physics with a minor in running PCRs. iGEM has provided me invaluable experience and knowledge in the field of synthetic biology.
Hello, I’m Pierce! I am a sophomore in Bioengineering with a focus on tissue engineering and cancer research. I am a Daniel Radcliffe wannabe and I aspire to one day grow a real beard.
Hello, my name is Ashwin Pillai. I enjoy short walks on the beach and mango smoothies. I hope to work for the CDC one day. I've learned an immense amount from IGEM and I hope to use this knowledge in the field of immunology.
Our Advisors!
Yong-Su Jin is an Associate Professor in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition and a faculty member of the Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB). He is a principal investigator of the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI).
Hello, I am Todd Freestone. I'm a graduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering working on natural product gene clusters. I've been working with iGEM for the past few years and digging every minute of it.
Hello, my name is Tim.
Greetings, my name is Jessica Beaudoin.  I’m a laboratory manager for the Institute for Genomic Biology and an independent research associate.  When not wrangling undergraduates, I enjoy playing guitar and pursuing various art projects. PS- don’t let me catch you in the lab after dark.
Hello, my name is Eric Andersen. The idea of making bacteria produce any molecule you want has interested me since high school, and now I'm mentoring an iGEM team.
Hi, my name is Michelle Goettge. I am a graduate student in the Department of Microbiology and I work on characterizing the biosynthesis of  phosphonate natural products. I have been enjoying helping out with the iGEM team at UIUC for the past few years!
Hello, my name is Stephan Lane. I am a graduate student in Food Science and Human Nutrition.  I get to do quite a bit of genetic engineering in my research, but I was happy to be able to jump on board and help out Illinois iGEM.
Hello, my name is Zach.
Special Thanks!
