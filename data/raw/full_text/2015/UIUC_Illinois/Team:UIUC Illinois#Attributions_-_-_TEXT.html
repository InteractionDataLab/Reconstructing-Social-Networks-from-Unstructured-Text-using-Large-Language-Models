Attributions
The work on our project was primarily done by our team of ten undergraduates; however, it would never have been possible without our numerous sources of external help.
Advisors
We would like to thank all of our advisors for their endless support in not only scientific knowledge and logistic experience, but also in a great amount of personal time and effort. All of the graduate research student advisors provided direction in protocol design and supervised our lab technique.
Dr. Yong-Su Jin, Associate Professor (Dept. FSHN, UIUC)/ Affiliated Faculty (IGB), oversaw the entirety of the project and provided us precious resources to achieve success.
