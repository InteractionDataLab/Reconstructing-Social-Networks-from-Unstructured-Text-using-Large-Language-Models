Our lab is a WHO BSL1 Lab, a low risk lab. We use a range of equipment from open areas, to laminar flow hoods, as well as standard lab safety practices. Cells cultures are killed with bleach before disposal, and general solid waste is collected into biohazard bags and disposed of.
All team members received training on biosafety levels, requirements for laboratory practices and equipment, biohazard containment, recombinant DNA, bioethics, fire safety, and personal protective equipment. Our institution's safety training policies are available here .
At our institution, we are supervised by the University of Chicago Office of Environmental Health and Safety. They provide a form as a guide to safety here. We are also under US law, which provides other guidelines here .
All of the strains that we are using are in risk group 1, with the potential to cause irritation, or affect kidneys
Specific safety concerns and responses include:
E.      coli MG1655 and DH5a, which belong to risk group 1 and may pose the      following risks: irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may      affect kidneys. All plates and cultures are disinfected with bleach after      use, and the lab benches are wiped down in 70% EtOH and then dH2O to      prevent contamination.
Some      toxic or harmful chemicals such as ethidium bromide, chloroform and      bleach. Team members are required to wear rubber gloves at all times in      labs, and lab coats when handling harmful chemicals.
Other      flammable chemicals such as isopropyl ethanol, ethanol, DMSO will be      handled with care and jf spilled, the liquids will be soaked up and the      lab bench or any affected areas will be wiped down and cleaned.
Hazardous      waste such as chloroform waste are collected in special waste bins in the      lab that will be treated by the University's hazardous waste disposal contractor.
All      members are required to take the biosafety lecture and a lecture on fire      safety held by the University. All members have had experience in lab work      and have had online trainings on safe lab practices.
We      hold weekly meetings with faculty and graduate student advisors such that      experienced wet lab scientists can provide advice and feedback on safe lab      practices. Moreover, all of our team members have had lab experience      before so that we can reduce the risk of human error. We have also chosen a      harmless lab strain of E. coli to prevent the risk of introduction or      spreading of harmful organisms. On a day to day basis, Justin Chew, one of      our grad advisers who works in the lab bench next to us, is on hand to      help us with any difficult wet lab protocols or emergencies that might      arise.
All      our expressed proteins in this proof-of-concept project are relatively      harmless and nontoxic, and used well-known, safe lab protocols for our      assays. In our Human Practices page , we discuss the      possibility of having to add a kill switch much later down the road if a      functional system is created in future years.
We      sent our DNA submissions as dried down DNA in the mail, and didn’t      encounter any problems with trying to submit them.
