Modeling overview
We created mathematical models of three aspects of our project: a      pharmacokinetic model, RNA inference model and signaling network model.     The source code of the modeling work is available here or on our Github Page to help others      reproduce and improve our work.
The delivery module used experimental results to simulate the kinetics      of tissue-distribution of exosomes. The RNAi module modeled the      kinetics of downregualtion of MOR protein in response to anti-MOR      siRNA. The signaling module theoretically predicted the impacts of      downregulating MOR protein on the reward pathway and explained the      behavioral change of mice observed in our laratory work. We had a      better understanding of our device by integrating three modules.
