3 Signaling module
3.1 Introduction
In our laboratory work, we performed CPP tests to explore the impact of downregulating   MOR protein on mouse behavior after morphine administration, which is the ultimate goal   of our project. In this module, computational and systems biology approaches were   applied to examine the root of behavior changes quantitatively at the molecular level.   The most important brain reward circuit involves dopamine-containing neurons in the VTA   of the midbrain. Morphine can cause indirect excitation of VTA dopamine neurons by   reducing inhibitory synaptic transmission mediated by GABAergic neurons [1,2].
We modeled the signaling network to investigate the emergent properties of the reward   pathway. By comparing the activation degree of the reward pathway before and after   downregulating MOR protein levels, we could have a better mechanistic understanding of   drug effects. Although we did not perform any experiment to support this modeling   module, the methods and parameters we chose are grounded in literature reports.

3.2 Model methods
We used both deterministic and stochastic models to describe the activation of GPCR   and release of GABA. In biological systems, signal transmission occurs primarily through two mechanisms: (i)   mass-action laws governing protein synthesis, degradation and interactions; and (ii)   standard Michaelis-Menten formulation for reactions catalyzed by enzymes [3].
Broadly, mathematical models of biochemical reactions can be divided into two   categories: deterministic systems and stochastic systems [3]. In deterministic models,   the change in time of the components’ concentrations is completely determined by   specifying the initial and boundary conditions; by contrast, the changes in   concentrations of components with respect to time cannot be fully predicted in   stochastic models [3]. In the previous two modules, we modeled the delivery device and   RNA interference using deterministic models.
3.2.1 Modeling the activation of MOR
MOR belongs to the class A (Rhodopsin) family of heterotrimeric Gi/o protein-coupled   receptors [4]. The binding of opioids to MOR activates the G protein, upon which both   G-protein α and βγ subunits interact with multiple cellular effector systems. As the   first step of signal transmission, the degree of activation of MOR in response to   opioid has a direct and far-reaching influence on the behavior of mice.
Deterministic models were applied to describe the biochemical reactions occurring in   the diagram below. We used the Matlab Simbiology package to draw the diagram and to   design the equation, the details of which are accessible on the uploaded files. This   model was created on the basis of work by Bhalla and Iyengar on the activation of   glutamate receptor [5].

3.2.2 Modeling adenylate cyclase inhibtion
The concentration of second messenger is a significant indicator of excitability of   GABAergic neurons. Thus, we chose to simulate cAMP levels and adenylate cyclase (AC)   activity to determine the effect of downregulating MOR protein levels on morphine   reward signaling networks.
AC1/8 is a type of adenylate cyclases involved in the signaling of the acute morphine   reward pathway [6]. When MOR is activated, the disassociated Gα subunit reacts with   AC1/8 and subsequently inhibits its activity, leading to a decrease in cellular cAMP   levels. The parameters of this model were primarily derived from the literature [5]   with slight modifications to fit to the data presented in the literature [7].

3.2.3 Modeling GABA vesicle releases
A stochastic model was applied to describe the random behavior of neurotransmitter   vesicles release [8]. GABA is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, the level of   which directly determines the firing rate of dopamine neurons and other physiological   and behavioral statuses. The GABA synaptic vesicle cycle consists of three discrete   processes: synthesis of GABA vesicles, docking of GABA vesicles at the inner membrane   of presynapses and release of GABA vesicles reacting to a certain signal. The release   of GABA vesicles is strictly regulated by cellular signaling networks. When Gi/o is   activated and the cellular cAMP level drops, the release of GABA is inhibited. Many   complicated mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of GABA release due to activation   of Gi/o. Here, we simply studied the action potential-independent pathway of GABA   release, through which the release of GABA is directly inhibited by activated Gβγ   subunits [9].

3.2.4 Gillespie’s algorithm
When spatially restricted reactions, such as the release of neurotransmitter vesicles,   are studied, the traditional deterministic model is no longer effective for ignoring   the discrete nature of the problem [3]. Stochastic models convert reaction rates to   probability, which allows users to explore the noise and randomness of signaling   networks. A standard algorithm dealing with stochastic model is Gillespie’s algorithm.   This algorithm starts with the initial condition for each molecule type in the reaction   network. Then, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to generate some random variables and   to calculate the smallest time interval in which the reaction will occur [3,10].   Finally, the number of molecules in the reaction network is updated, and the process is   repeated.
3.3 Results The simulation results revealed the kinetics of MOR activation in case and control   studies. In the CPP test, the Western blot result demonstrated that the relative level   of MOR protein after MOR-siRNA injection was 0.5. Thus, the concentration of MOR protein was set at half of the level in the case   study.
The results indicated that almost all the MOR protein is activated in response to   morphine. The quantity and action of Gα and βγ subunits highly correlates with the   quantity of MOR protein. By downregulating the MOR protein to half of its initial   level, we also inhibit approximately half of activated Gα and βγ subunits.

B: Case study with the   concentration of MOR set at 0.5 mM due to downregulation by MOR-siRNA. Ga_GTP and Gbg   represents activated Gα and βγ subunit, respectively.
The primary effector of activated Gα subunit is AC. The activation degree of AC   influences its product cAMP—an important second messenger that indicates the   excitability of GABAergic neurons. We now theoretically predicted and compared the   inhibition of Gα subunit on AC and the subsequent decrease in cellular cAMP levels in   control (wild type) and case (MOR-siRNA injected) studies.
Figure 13. Effect of downregulating MOR protein on AC activity (A) and cellular cAMP   levels (B) in response to morphine. The input level of MOR protein is based on the   result shown in Figure 10.
Activation of wild type MOR protein inhibited over 25% of AC, and relative cellular   cAMP levels dropped below 70%, which is consistent with findings in the literature[7]. The injection of MOR-siRNA reduces the activation quantity of MOR and significantly   attenuates the inhibition of AC and decrease in cAMP levels. Maintaining the cellular   cAMP level induced by the drug plays a crucial role in blocking reward pathways.
Finally, we explored the relationship between MOR activation and GABA release. The wild   type study revealed significant inhibition of GABA vesicles due to activated G βγ   subunits. MOR-siRNA counteracted this trend by downregulating MOR protein and activated   G βγ subunit levels as depicted in the case study. Maintaining GABA release reduces   the excitability and firing rate of dopamine neurons, which is consistent with the   expected drug effect on blockage of the reward pathway and explain the behavioral   changes observed in the CPP tests.

3.4 Conclusion and remarks
In this module, we used deterministic and stochastic methods to model the cell   signaling network and to predict the blockage of the reward pathway by injecting MOR-  siRNA. The simulation results could somewhat explain the behavioral changes observed in   the CPP tests (function tests) mechanistically.
3.5 Model equations, variables and parameters
The modeling details of the activation of MOR protein and inhibition of AC are   truncated here because we use software to help us design the model and there are too   many parameters and equations. We have uploaded relevant source code and files for   those individuals interested in exploring the models. However, we want to emphasize   that our parameters are all derived from the literature. The modeling of GABA release   is inspired by the literature [8] and the parameters were estimated from literature   [2].  These parameters, as well as initial conditions, can be accessed in our uploaded files   and we selectively list part of them below.
