Collaboration
Since firstly taking part in iGEM, NJU-China has the tradition of communicating with   other teams in China. We do not only exchange our ideas and experiences with others, but   also spread the knowledge of synthetic biology as well as iGEM Competition in China.   This year we kept the tradition and took part in several activities. These activities strengthened our understanding of synthetic biology and deepened the   friendship with other teams. We benefit each other in a mutual way.
Collaboration with SYSU-Software
We cooperated with the Software team from Sun Yat-sen University to develop the   conditioned place preference (CPP) mice image recognition software, and utilize the   software into our CPP test to record the reflection of mice. The software is able to present the statistic results in the form of heat maps,   reflecting the movement of mice directly and vividly.  We thank our collaborator for receiving us with attention and for such strong   contribution to our work.
In this experiment, we have seven mice. Each mouse is placed in a pair of interconnected   cages, including a bright one and a dark one. Our experiment requires us to record the   mice movement in order to accomplish the following goals:
1.To tell which cage the mice prefer to stay, bright one or dark one
2.Record the mice coordinate precisely
It’s hard for us to finish such job in tradition way. So we decided to seek some   software to assist us. However, the software available to us can not meet our demands.   It is really tricky. Fortunately, in iGEM China Community, we contact SYSU-Software, a   well-known software team and ask them to produce a tool for us. With their tool, we   record and analyze the video. Finally we obtain the following results:
1.The data of the mice coordinate, 30 times per second
2.Based on the data, the tool can generate a Heat Maps, from which, we can know which   cage the mice prefer to stay
Once again, we would like to thank SYSU-Software.
Collaboration with NUDT_China
1.NUDT_China helped us to perform nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to have a more   precise determination of the quantity and size of secreted exosomes. They did a   supereminent experiment for us and we collected the perfect data we want.
2.We also helped NUDT_China to construct a TAL effector. The recognition sequence of TALE1 (provided by NUDT_CHINA): 5’-GGAGGCACCGGTGG -3’   (14bp)
The corresponding RVD: NN NN NI NN NN HD NI HD HD NN NN NG NN NN
Figure 1 Sequence of TALE1 cDNA and deduced amino acids.
The construction of this implemented with Golden Gate TALEN and TAL Effector Kit 2.0 by   Addgene.
We then reedited the vector pTAL1 provided by the kit to add EcoRI, SpeI and PstI   cutting cite to make the TALE we built using this vector can meet the RCF10 standard.
Conferences with NJAU_China
We held several project intercommunion meetings with Nanjing Agricultural University and   exchanged our ideas and experiences. During the meetings, we provided some suggestions   on their project. We also offered many plasmids to support their experiments   efficiently.
Mentoring FAFU-CHINA
We helped the iGEM team from Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in their topic   revision and provided them with some suggestions. We also provided a vigorous support   for their follow-on experiments.
Offering Parts
We communicated experiments and modeling with the iGEM team from Northeast Agricultural   University, and also offered RVG-Lamp 2b parts to help them finish their project.
