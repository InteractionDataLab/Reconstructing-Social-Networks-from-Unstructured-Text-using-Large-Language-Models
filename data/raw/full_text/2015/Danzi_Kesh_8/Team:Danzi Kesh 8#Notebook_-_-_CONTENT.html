After a long and thorough discussion of the pros and cons we decided to enter the contest as a team, despite the difficulty in managing a large group.
           One of the main difficulties was: lack of complete knowledge of genetic engineering, that's why we started to study with Maggie the subject of genetic engineering as part of classroom lessons.</P><P><STRONG>Crash course in genetic engineering</STRONG> Despite the enthusiasm and excitement of the experience before us we began to understand the knowledge gap we need to overcome before entering the laboratory. The topic itself is fascinating to us as students, we suddenly realized just how limitless the world and science has become an almost unlimited field.</P><P><STRONG>Activity beginning</STRONG>Meeting with Associate Professor Roy Amit (synthetic biology assistant professor, Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering and Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute) from the Technion.

          Excitement was in the air, a new product development that does not exist in the market and the flight abroad with the major of
           biotechnology would sound like a fantasy. In those moments we did not know and did not understand the meaning of the IGEM entry experience.</P><P><STRONG>Exposing the idea to the Team</STRONG>All members of the Team gathered to be exposed to the idea upon which we were going to work over the coming months, at the meeting we met the Advisor Dr. Yadid and we started to discuss the development of the product the best we could, students suggestions were accepted and we were able to combine our ideas with Dr. Yadid's.</P><P><STRONG>Meeting:</STRONG>    </P><OL class="ordererd-list"><LI class="list-item">Meeting at Migal (Upper Galilee Research Institute, Institute specializes in food biotechnology research) Professor Segula Mutzafi, Search Advisor for the project.

In fact, all five teams worked hard and were dependent on each other to get the complete product.
           Set up the team site and divided into organized work groups: writing, documentation, logistics, laboratory and presentation:</P><OL class="ordererd-list"><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Lab Team:</STRONG> This team worked on the scientific aspects in product development from the idea stage. Their work was great and they invested a lot of time and effort, without all their work the work of the other groups was useless. The lab team was responsible for lab work and the writing of work process into a daily notebook.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Documentation team:</STRONG> The team was responsible for documenting and marketing the team in any way possible. The documentation team was responsible for preserving significant and awkward moments to be able to describe the
             process from the beginning. The documentation team was responsible for producing the group's videos, short documentation and ongoing blogs, photos, videos, articles and more .. The documentation team has been active in all
             social networks: Google +, Facebook, Twitter and even Instagram. Their aim is to spread the idea and to maintain the process.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Site and writing team:</STRONG> in charge of the wiki site construction. Their work was very important for the transfer of information passed on to them from all the other groups, the translation from Hebrew into English, and looking at website design that attracts the eye. The writing team documented in words and images the events that took place in the classroom ever since the decision to participate in the competition was made.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Presentation Team:</STRONG> The face of our Team. Members of this team will represent us in any event related to the spreading of the project and the competition itself. Team members were interviewed by the local press and met with donors. They meet frequently with Dave and work on their English language accent and way of speaking, yet ultimately; they are the ones who are supposed to represent us in the competition in Boston and speak professionally and proficiently and to
             represent us with dignity.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Logistics Team:</STRONG> running and working overtime behind the scenes to take care and make sure everything is, that no group is not missing anything everyone is working consistently and nobody gets stuck in the back, they push the team forward and take care of all things great and small alike. This team has produced all the classroom activities, for example, coordinating meetings, writing and distributing surveys and more.</LI></OL><P>It is important to note that all groups are necessary to carry out the process and think equally, without the contribution of each
           member the entire project would have been in vain, and so each and every member has to give his 100%. Most students took part in two teams.
          After the exposure of the project to financers, scientists and academics from across the country the Team travelled to represent us at several conferences: The Annual Manufacturers Conference, International Science Day at Tel Hai College and the annual scientific meeting at Tel Hai College.</P><P><STRONG>LAB : </STRONG>No activity </P><H2 class="section-title subtitle">may</H2><P><STRONG>Synthetic Biology Conference – May 21</STRONG>When we started off we established, in cooperation with K-grade graduates in biotechnology, the synthetic biology conference in the country's first youth in the field of synthetic biology. The conference was held at the school.
          The conference was attended by approximately 400 students who study science and live in the northern periphery of the state of Israel. The Mayor of Kiryat Shmona, professors, journalists, members of the Knesset and scientists from Tel Hai College attended the conference as observers as well as a few lecturers.
          At first we started to expose our project and its objectives, we received a lot of compliments and the participants were impressed by our initiative and devotion towards the process.
