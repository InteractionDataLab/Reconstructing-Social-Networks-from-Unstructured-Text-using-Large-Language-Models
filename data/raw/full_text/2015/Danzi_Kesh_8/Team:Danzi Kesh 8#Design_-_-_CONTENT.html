Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease that damages the villi of the small intestine and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food. Celiac disease can affect men and women in all ages and races. It can lead to a number of other disorders including infertility, reduced bone density, neurological disorders, some cancers, and other autoimmune diseases. </P><P>The disease is due to sensitivity to the gliadin protein, components, with another protein named glutamine, which also contains components that are harmful for celiac sufferers. The gliadin protein is a proteoglycan; this is actually a protein that has sugar. The glutamine protein has a molecular structure of a three-dimensional network.</P><P>The gluten mainly found in cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye. In wheat for example, the gluten constitutes to 80 percent of the protein in the nucleus. </P><P>The celiac disease is an autoimmune disease. The immune system cells accidentally identify the gliadin protein as a strange object which absorbs in the inner wall cells of the small intestine. The sufferer's immune system attacks the cells in the intestine and causes problems with the absorbing of food.  Food hypersensitivity disorder caused by an. inflammatory response to wheat gluten and similar proteins of barley and rye. The resulting intestinal inflammation often causes symptoms related to malabsorption, but in many patients extra-intestinal symptoms dominate, and in others the disease is clinically silent. </P></DIV><DIV class="image-caption">Fig 1: The difference between the small intestine of celiac sufferer to  healthy small intestine </DIV><P>There are no pharmaceutical cures for the celiac disease, 100% gluten-free diets are the only existing treatment for celiac today.

Since there is no cure for the disease, they can just avoid eating foods containing gluten. They are forbidden to eat the most common and favorite foods: pasta, pizza, bread, cakes and biscuits, sweets and more....  </P><P>Many times you can find substitutes for the forbidden foods, but in some cases the gluten-free food will have an aftertaste and often very expensive.</P><P>Most of the Israeli food products labeled as &quot;may contain gluten &quot;, not necessarily the food products contain gluten.</P><H2 class="section-title subtitle">What does Alergln Provide?</H2><P>The Alergln kit allows for <STRONG>quick testing</STRONG> of food products. This quick test is very reliable and allows a <STRONG>professional analysis</STRONG> on the amount of gluten that a particular food product has. We assume that some foods labeled that &quot;may contain remnants of gluten&quot;, remnants of gluten will not be found, which would enable many buyers to eat food which should be forbidden, as well enjoy a lower product prices.</P><P><STRONG>The aim of our project</STRONG> is to create a personal kit, one that identifies gluten in food, reliably and in reasonable time. This kit will allow to ease the celiac patient's life and reduce their expenses to a great extent. </P><P><STRONG>The &quot;Alergln&quot; Kit</STRONG> is based on a fascinating innovative technology in the diagnostic world, just as the kit to identify pregnancy brought with it a series of scientific technology, equally, this kit brings innovation and a breakthrough in a way of thinking and designing the kit. In the future, we believe that the idea can be implemented and utilized as well in areas to identify other substances, not necessarily food materials.</P><P><STRONG>The &quot;Alergln Project&quot;</STRONG> was created after the realization that the number of people diagnosed in having gluten sensitivity (celiac disease) increases from year to year. The number of diagnosed celiac patients increases annually worldwide mostly due to awareness of this phenomenon. This awareness eases and enables many people real quality of life without the horrendous stomach pains. Celiac disease patients are not treated with drugs because the drug is not available, these patients simply avoid eating gluten. Therefore, they must verify whether the food they intend eating has gluten or not. The scales to check are often complicated and not necessarily accurate.</P><P><STRONG>The &quot;Alergln&quot; kit</STRONG> will serve the above population, prevent them from concern for the presence of gluten in food and can eat with peace of mind and <STRONG>without
worrying about their lives.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>The success of the project</STRONG> will allow patients to eat foods that &quot;may contain gluten,&quot; but there is no gluten, the difference in prices is very high and hence the kit cancels the presence of gluten in regular foods and allows the patient to eat without any concern, and at a lower cost.</P></DIV><H2 class="section-title subtitle">The feasibility of the
product
</H2><P>In recent years, the awareness of the of celiac disease has increased, and perhaps that is why the number of people diagnosed is increasing constantly. Allegedly we are talking about unexplained &quot;abdominal pains&quot;, however, many times it turns out that the pain stems from sensitivity to gluten and can be avoided by refraining from eating foods that contain gluten. After the survey we conducted interviews with family physicians and pediatricians, we decided that this kit is extremely necessary for celiac patients and therefore has economical potential.</P><H2 class="section-title subtitle">Why is it
worthwhile to buy the product ?</H2><OL><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Quality of life without pain:</STRONG> We are talking about abdominal pain, in reality, it disrupts the normal way of life, use of the product could prevent unnecessary pain due to a lack of knowledge about the contents of the product.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>A quick, accurate and inexpensive test:</STRONG> restaurant businesses are not obliged to marking gluten content in the food, sometimes the situation may be critical.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>There is no embarrassment:</STRONG> a school student would not have to stand embarrassed, wondering what to eat. This kit can help him choose the right food that has no gluten or avoid eating foods containing gluten.</LI><LI class="list-item"><STRONG>Cut expenses:</STRONG> Americans spend 5 billion dollars on gluten-free food every year, about $ 4,000 more than an ordinary person for the unmet medical need for celiac patients and therefore it is necessary to have a unique diet which is very expensive. Sometimes the nutritional information marking &quot;may contain gluten&quot; is not accurate, and in this case you can use our kit. The celiac disease is a hereditary disease, meaning that every family has a reasonable possibility of purchasing &quot;Alergln&quot; through other family members.</LI></OL><H2 class="section-title subtitle">References</H2><DIV class="w-clearfix link-to-pdf"><A class="link below-paragraph" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/b/bc/Danzi_References.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF with full References</A></DIV><H2 class="section-title" id="PROTOCOLS">protocols</H2><DIV class="w-clearfix link-to-pdf"><A class="link below-paragraph" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/f/f8/Danzi_Protocols.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF with full Protocols</A></DIV><H2 class="section-title advisors-title" id="PROJECT-ACHIEVENMENTS">Project Achievenments</H2><P>In the course of the work and preparations towards the big iGEM project, we feel that we have gone through a significant process as a group.
        The intensive and long work enriched our knowledge in scientific topics where we worked. Without a doubt we feel
         that we received a one-time opportunity to work in real scientific research where we would never have been able to acquire as students in our regular, standard curriculum in biotechnology. We enriched our knowledge in every aspect of biotechnology and around it, and even experimented on designing and implementing a big project, and work as part of a team where we learnt tocooperate and give space to each member of the team. All these things together led to creating new social relationships.
        In the course of the work we met businessman, parliament members, doctors in different fields of science, and we created connections and relationships with people who promoted us and can promote us in the future.</P><P>In addition to all of that, we feel that the work we did in our free time strengthened the work ethic of every one of us, the capability to plan time in the right way and to stick to the target.
        However, we encountered a number of difficulties where at the end of the day we overcame them.
        Each member of the team contributed to the team with his or her skills towards the project, meaning that we gave up our summer vacation, gave up family trips and most of the time we also gave up hanging out with friends.</P><P>This and more, at the beginning of the school year we did not stop working on the project and this meant missing lessons, and of course catching up on all the material in our free time</P><P>Another challenge we had, not all the students were fully committed to the hard work the project needed.
        At times there were a few students who were ready to perform any task, and even when there was a problem performing
        the task, there were not always students who came forward to give a hand in solving the problem.</P><P>Towards the end of this intensifying process, we can say that we went through a unique and one-time experience, where during the time we came across quite a few challenges, however, we learnt to jump over the hurdles and overcome every challenge that came our way, there is no doubt we received many values due to our being a team and we will reach our goal … Boston we are coming!</P><H2 class="section-title advisors-title" id="SYSTEM-DESIGN">system design</H2><H2 class="section-title subtitle">Project Goal: Design a
kit to identify gluten in food </H2><P>The kit will contain a biosensor that identifies gluten and will confirm the presence by creating a change in color. Designing the kit is on the use the Gln-H protein. This periplasmatic protein is made up from two lobes, one big and one small. The protein identifies the gluten through a connection to amino acid glutamine found in a relatively high concentrate. The connection to glutamine is done in the molecular center of the protein. </P><P>In order to implement the process we were required to divide it into a number of stages as described below:</P><DIV class="image-caption">Figure 1 – acitvity steps in Project Alergln H</DIV><H2 class="section-title subtitle">Designing 6 DNA segments
encoded to Gln-H protein</H2><P>Three bacterial sources served us as a source to express the Gln-H protein: TM1, GBS, E.coli.</P><P>To each one of the three a new gene encoded to the protein was reassembled. To each one of the genes we added a reporter. Because we used two types of reporters (GFP, HAD) on each the DNA sources two copies of the gene to the Gln-H protein, so in the end we created 6 biosensors. For example, from the DNA segment encoded to the Gln-H protein and its source in the GBS bacteria will be comprised once with the HAD reporter and once again through GFP. </P><P>Work design for the six mutant genes was done using APE software; the six mutants were created to increase the chances of success of the planned system.</P><P>Below are details of the structure of the 6 mutants: </P><DIV class="image-caption">TM- HAD</DIV><DIV class="image-caption">TM-GFP</DIV><DIV class="image-caption">GBS-HAD</DIV><DIV class="image-caption">GBS- GFP</DIV><DIV class="image-caption">EC-HAD</DIV><DIV class="image-caption">EC- GFP</DIV><P>In order to engineer the protein in which the ends will close when we link to gluten, we changed the protein's terminal ends position. This is by binding linkers to the edges of the N Terminal, the original C terminals of the small sub-unit and the big one respectively and opening the ends (C, N terminals) in other places.  Figure 2 describes the process of transferring C ends, N terminals; figure 2 shows the end position and the position of the linker in Gln at the end of the process. It is important to note that the linker includes 3 amino acids – serine, glycine that influence the amount of flexibility of the molecules at the time linking to glutamine.

The change in color will occur only when the connection is through gluten.</P><P>In fact we have created three mutant cycles in three genes encoded to the Gln-H protein. Each of the genes (when translated to protein) will act as follows: Without gluten - the protein will be in the open position and therefore the half enzyme will remain inactive and there will not be a color reaction.</P><P>The presence of gluten - the protein closes, following; the half enzyme will close and become an active enzyme with the result of a color reaction.</P><H2 class="section-title subtitle">The

</STRONG> Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formally Bacillus stearothermophilus) is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium and a member of the division Firmicutes. The bacteria is a thermophile and is widely distributed in soil, hot springs, ocean sediment, and is a cause of spoilage in food products. It will grow within a temperature range of 30-75 degrees Celsius. Some strains are capable of oxidizing carbon monoxide aerobically. It is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. </P><P>It was first described in 1920 as Bacillus stearothermophilus, but, together with Bacillus thermoglucosidasius, it was reclassified as a member of the genus Geobacillus in 2001.

This technology allows one-step purification of almost any His-tagged protein from any expression system under native or denaturing conditions.
