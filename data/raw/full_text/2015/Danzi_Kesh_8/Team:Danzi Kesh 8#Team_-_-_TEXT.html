background
We are from Israel, Kiryat Shmona, a small, quiet and beautiful town. Kiryat Shmona is the most northwestern town in Israel, and gets a lot of visitors and travelers due to the spectacular views. Kiryat Shmona is in the “Galilee region”. You can find nature, history, extreme activities, picnic sites and heritage, in short, a bit of everything in one beautiful region. 
Kiryat Shmona has one central comprehensive high school with 1350 students from seventh through twelfth grade. We are sophomore students studying Biotechnology as one of our major subjects. As part of this major, we learn and engage in synthetic biology. Last year we created a garment from the Kombucha fungus, and this year we are working diligently to produce the assessment to identify food allergens, which we are presenting here.
The biotechnology team includes 23 10th grade students. The students have been studying together since 7th grade until today. The school is characterized by a team of teachers who teach the students mostly on how to deal with challenges. The group of students intensifies their math and science studies exceptionally. We are all planning a science academic career. Alongside the studies, each member of the team is involved in volunteering for the community in their free time.
