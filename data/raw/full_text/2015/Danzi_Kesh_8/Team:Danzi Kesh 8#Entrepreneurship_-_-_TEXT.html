ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Public surveys
During the work we carried out two surveys. The initial survey was carried out randomly among the residents of Kiryat Shmona before entering the laboratory to examine the initial feasibility of the kit, the second survey was intended solely for celiac patients and was conducted through social networking. 
The first survey objectives were:
To check how common sensitivity to food substances are to those of the population who were tested.
To examine the need for a product that helps, like “Alergln” to identify the antigen for sensitive people .
Details of the survey:
The survey was conducted among 150 participants of which 52 were males and 98 were females.
66 participants aged 40-55, 84 participants aged 16-17.
The survey findings showed that 44% of survey respondents have some sensitivity to food (fig 1).
fig 1: breakdown of allergy according to age
According to Figure 1 - the percentage of sensitivity to food in young age groups who checked in the survey:
17% of respondents up to age 19, 18% up to age 49, and 9% of the survey participants were over 50.
The sensitivity to a component of any food, a fact that increases the chances of the sale of a product to older people who develop, with age varied food sensitivities. Participants in the survey "The Sensitives" reported that when they come in contact with the antigen it may disrupt their daily routine and even confine them to bed because of pain or unpleasant feelings like an itchy rash and suffocation. Everyone, without exception, are interested in being able to prevent the reaction because this action will save them discomfort, loss of days at school / work and certainly the use of drugs often containing steroids. 
All participants in the survey who have food allergies said they spend more than $ 50 a month during an attack, on drugs and tranquilizers.
When we asked if they had a product in the form of our kit if they would buy it? 83% answered positively (fig 2), suggesting the feasibility of manufacturing the product also for other nutrients that cause sensitivities.
fig 2: Percentage of people who are interested in purchasing our product
It is important to emphasize that the common treatment for food allergy is to avoid eating the same cause of allergenic; this fact requires no small expense for the purchase of supplements. If you could find suspected foods containing allergenic substances in food it may be easier to cope with avoiding and reduce the costs of food. 
The survey data showed that ten people (15%) of all survey participants are celiac patients.
100% of celiac patients who responded to the survey claimed that there is great difficulty not only in dealing with the prevention of eating but also in routine life. All patients without exception argued that the cost of gluten-free food is very high in relative to other foods. 
100% of patients claimed that the educational system does not address patients with celiac, food offered to all students is the same irrespective of celiac patients or students with other allergies.
Since the number of celiac patients in the first survey was quite small, we decided on a more extensive survey addressed solely for celiac patients. The survey was published on social networks and on the Israel Association of celiac patients.
The purpose of the second survey was to investigate the feasibility of the kit we are developing for celiac patients. The kit is intended for celiac patients and is supposed to detect the presence of gluten in food. The survey was conducted through the sharing and publishing on social networks and on the Israeli Celiac Association.
170 patients suffering from celiac participated in the survey, 142 females and 38 males.
The ages range from 2-76 years.
Most of the survey participants feel that celiac disease to some extent restricts them in their lives (fig 3).
fig 3: Does gluten sensitivity limit your daily routine
This data indicates the need to make celiac patients be less concerned and create a situation with minimal dealings with the disease. We believe lowering prices and providing an easy possibility to check for the presence of gluten in food will ease the life of celiac patients immensely. Further on in the survey we found strengthening of this speculation:
fig 4: How accessible is gluten-free food products to you
The survey dealt mainly on the attitude of businesses and the education system towards celiac patients. More than 50% said that the Ministry of Education treats the illness as a handicap and in actual fact ignores the presence of these students in the classroom.
More than 60% of respondents, celiac patients do not feel safe when they eat in restaurants for fear that the food contains gluten. 41% of them give up on dishes in a restaurant for fear that it contains gluten.
The final section of the survey examined the feasibility of developing the product. 93% of celiac patients testified that they would buy the kit if it were offered to the consumer. 42% said that the time it should take the kit to check should be half a minute. 
93% percent of the respondents said that they would purchase the kit if the prce would be affordable for a disposable kit.
The survey data encouraged us to continue working on the development of our kit out of understanding that celiac patients are interested in an available, inexpensive, accurate kit that will help them with their daily coping with the disease.
“Alergln” – Eat safely, BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE ALERGLN KIT
Using our product celiac patients can safely eat the food served to them in restaurants, food stalls, hotels and even at home without fear after the simple home test, as well as avoiding an outbreak of serious bowel inflammation.
Product description – Alergln Kit
The kit is easy to carry as jewelry or in a purse or small handbag.
The test kit consists of a filter with two small windows. All you need is to drip the tested material mixed with water into the filter in the appropriate place and wait.
After a few moments there will be a color marking on the control window in addition to another marking on the inspection window (assuming that the product contains gluten), or there won't be a marking If the product does not contain gluten.
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS
Celiac patients who want to find out if the food in front of them contains or does not contain gluten.
Young High School Students who suffer from celiac who are ashamed to ask if the food served to them in the classroom/cafeteria contain gluten.
Families with a celiac patient who wish to reduce the price of the family food costs significantly by confirming the presence or absence of gluten in food.
Consumer Benefits of the Alergln Kit 
Comfortable to carry in your purse or as a jewel in relation to other kits which are cumbersome and heavy.
Affordable for every pocket.
Safe to use: external and harmless check. 
Using the product is simple and easy.
Alergln will allow celiac patients to eat safely without worrying about the presence of gluten in food.
Reduces "gluten-free" food costs in cases where the manufacturer noted the possibility of gluten presence where there was no gluten to start with.
There is no such kit to the best of our knowledge, so in an investor's perspective there is substantial economic viability.
Alergln will reduce the embarrassment of young celiac patients, for example in school where there is a question whether food contains gluten or not.
Financing
Initial capital raising will be done by identifying a group of interested investors. The initial funding will include construction of a building, purchase of raw materials, recruitment, and writing work procedures. 
Since this is about writing a patent (apparently there is no such kit), there is a need to channel resources for patent registration.
Safety
The product does not contain chemicals.
Product is sensitive in detecting low and negligible concentrations of gluten, that do not cause abdominal pain (the exact value is still under review).
Alergln is an external test and is therefore safe to use. 
Key partners
Migal Institute in cooperation with the Tel Hai College - our partners in knowledge and how to give and execute our presentation. With their help we are able to produce and present the product in the best way possible.
There is a need to find a group of investors who would be willing to invest money in the idea and fund the initial cost of the product.
Moving Alergln to the consumer
Alergln will be distributed to all consumers and will be accessible wherever food is sold (supermarket, restaurants, shopping malls, etc.), Pharm stores, online, and pharmacies.
Competitors
There are gluten-free detection kits on the market, but they are cumbersome to carry and operate. According to a YouTube video, it takes a minimum of 8 minutes to identify gluten and we want to do it immediately.
There is (to the best of our knowledge,) at the moment no company in the world which is developing a similar product for identifying gluten in food. Other laboratories around the world, such as a group of researchers from the University of Alberta and a IGEM Team San Andres Chile, are developing an internal system to neutralize gluten in the body.
Statistics of Celiac in Israel and the United States
An estimated 1 in 133 Americans, or about 1% of the population, has celiac disease.
It is estimated that 83% of Americans who have celiac disease are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions.
6-10 years is the average time a person waits to be correctly diagnosed. (Source: Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, The Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center).
5-22% of celiac patients have an immediate family member (1st degree relative) who also has celiac.
Over a four-year period, people with undiagnosed celiac disease cost an average of $3,964 more than healthy individuals.  (Source: Long et al, 2010).
The celiac disease diagnosis rate may reach 50-60% by 2019, thanks to efforts to raise public awareness of celiac disease. (Source: Datamonitor Group, 2009).
The number of celiac patients in Israel is rising from year to year and now has several tens of thousands. Celiac disease awareness has also increased among the population of the State of Israel and, therefore, the potential customer base in the country and abroad is growing from year to year. 
in the future
The kit can be used by other people by changing the device who are sensitive to other foods containing lactose, peanuts etc... 
The technology can be used to identify other materials that are not necessarily related to any food sensitivity.
an expret opinion
One of the essential steps in a new product which has not yet entered the market is - checking with experts from various fields related to the particular product.
In order to test the feasibility of our product we approached three different experts who are involved in some way to the "Alergln" kit.
The first expert: Dr. Irina Barsleviski –pediatrician. Dr. Irina brought the medical aspect of the field.
The second expert: Dr. Maayan Gal –protein biochemistry expert. Dr. Maayan was interviewed in order to learn up front the scientific feasibility of the product.
The third expert: Dr. Erel Margalit. Erel Margalit is an active Member of Parliament in Israel. A businessman, founder and chairman of the international capital risk fund JVP, with it's HQ in Jerusalem, he also works in promoting the city of Jerusalem, the Southern periphery region (Beer Sheva), and the North (East Galilee).
Interview with an expert in biochemistry; Dr. Maayan Gal
 Dr. Maayan with Team members Or and Yuval
In order to evaluate the product from another scientific point of view and in a commercial eye we met with a scientist who works in the biochemistry field. Dr. Maayan manages a laboratory at the Migal Institute, the institute deals in a variety of topics including practices related to proteins in various fields of study.
Dr. Maayan (age-38) shared with us his life in high school. About the importance of basic knowledge he acquired at high school, which has helped him to progress in his life as a scientist. Dr. Maayan studied physics, computers and electronics.
Dekel: In which fields do you work as a scientist?
Dr. Maayan: In the past I dealt with fields concerning chemistry, physics, and biology. My doctorate dealt with nuclear magnetic resonance, most people know it as MRI machines in hospitals, based on a big magnet which enables us to look at the tissue and see if there is a tumor or any other problems. You can see this on the basis of the technology which is based on the fact that there is a magnetic field.
I use the same technology as the MRI in order to look at biological materials, for example, when I look at protein in a vial, I can learn with the help of the device how the protein looks, if when we put a substance into the protein such as medicine there is a structural change of the protein or its chemical characteristics and that is based on the reaction of the molecular structure with the presence of the magnet”.
At this moment of enthusiasm we followed Dr. Maayan to his laboratory and watched a number of examples to understand how they react to magnetic resonance, I must admit that it is awesome!
Later in the conversation we told Dr. Maayan about the IGEM competition in which we are participating in and our chosen "Alergln" project "." I asked him what he thought about the kit and whether there is room to improve the technology we chose.
“I think that the idea is very good for the project as well as for the competition. The biological process you have chosen is special and not common; the social thought after the biological idea is very interesting.  Along with this, the process is based on known fluorescent processes; however, I think it would be a lot more practical to find if possible to have an interaction with a simpler method to measure, like electrical conductivity. We are talking about a home check and I think it necessary to have a simpler method for measuring. As for today, it is not easy to measure fluorescence, together with this, in my opinion your genes that included enzyme activity could have a better chance to operate a home process in a more simple and successful way.
Dekel: “Do you know of any transmembrane protein that knows how to identify another protein?”
Dr. Maayan: “There are plenty of such proteins, for example, protein pd1 where the antibody of melanoma disease identifies it, and it detects another protein called pdl1. The idea of using proteins of this type as indicators is very unique idea and original, job well done.”
Dekel: “Are you familiar with a kit or methods based on the same idea?”
Dr. Maayan: I think that the idea of using transmembrane proteins is amazing. I fear that are quite a few obstacles that may appear on the way just like any scientific process. There is a large variety of fluorescence measurements which are based on the closeness of the two fluorescent substances where one triggers the other; it is called "FRET", and then a physical closeness is formed between two molecules, and then it is possible to measure the emission of light. The idea to split the reporter into two is special and can do a good job provided there is careful planning.
I would like to add that there are quite a few kits or processes performed on the basis of enzyme activity and they work relatively well and simpler than fluorescence. However, also in this way there will be expected problems you will have to deal with. In my opinion the genes you used in the enzymes have a better chance to succeed than fluorescence.”
Dekel: “what are the disadvantages with the kit in your opinion?”
Dr. Maayan: The way it is measured, that it will be easier for the end user. I have a few friends whose children are celiac patients and I find it difficult to see them measuring it. I think that fluorescent measuring devices are not yet developed enough for home users who understand nothing about it, someone at home needs to press the switch and get an answer yes or no. it is possible that there are kits I don’t know about and then there is no disadvantage, but I personally am not familiar developed enough for home use, if it would work on electrical conductivity or ph. It’s possible that your idea is ahead of time and in a few years when the measuring technology will make progress your kit will be able to be used to measure the presence of celiac. As far as the enzyme activity goes, in my opinion it has better chance of succeeding, it is possible that the thermophile proteins created an interesting and unexpected process for you, it may even work very well”.
Dekel: “do you think the product will be useful?”
Dr. Maayan: “If it will be good then yes, however, I have not performed an extensive market survey. In my opinion and to what I know from friends or parents of celiac patient children they would be very happy to have a reliable device to check gluten because they don’t trust foods labeled “gluten free” or something similar would make them extremely pleased to check themselves, of course in restaurants as well because it is a small device you can take with you everywhere. In my eyes the idea is fantastic, what’s more is that you can use the same technology to detect other substances other than celiac.”
Dekel: “What is your opinion on the fact that the Ministry of Education does not acknowledge children with celiac?”
Dr. Maayan: “First of all this is a topic I am not familiar enough with, however, at large, I think that the educational system as a line of guidance needs to allow children overcome any kind of disability in order to succeed in fitting in with the system, celiac is a kind of health disability that needs acknowledgment and things need to be done in order to help them fit in so they can eat like they should and go to school without fear that something may happen, I don’t know what needs to be done to make that happen and I also don’t know how easy it is to solve it, and how easy it will be for them not to be exposed to gluten.”
At the end of the conversation we spoke to Dr. Maayan openly about the scientific collaboration need as is with Igem. After the meeting with him we understood that collaboration does not characterize and basically known in the science world and that the world of science has less interest in sharing knowledge, unlike in the world of Igem.

Has the number of referrals in the field of allergies increased in recent years?
"It's difficult to say", it might have, there are always inquiries about allergies, sometimes more and sometimes less, it depends on the period."
What is the most common allergy?
“In food: nuts and milk”.
Our group is engaged in celiac disease (gluten sensitivity), have you faced in Celiac Disease sufferers lately? If so, what is the frequency?
"Lately, there has been an increase in incidences of celiac disease because we diagnose more, what once we did not check; now we are testing and are more insistent."
What are the light symptoms of the disease and what are the worst situations? Can you give an example?
“Now, the years have progressed and technology has evolved, celiac disease may be a disease without symptoms, and may have clinical signs, many years ago it was a disease with severe effects, for example children who did not develop because they did not gain weight, had swollen bellies, were weak, had anemia, but it was a long time ago. Now the situation has changed and sometimes children with signs like, thin children do not gain weight, just less than before, and not tall, abdominal pain, diarrhea. Today, it is not a disease that can lead to death, but there can be complications at a later age which can lead to intestinal tumors, then it can lead to death. "
Is there any treatment for celiac disease today? If so, what?
"The treatment for celiac disease is a special diet with a gluten-free menu, there is no real cure."
Background on the product. Do you think the product will contribute to celiac patients’ quality of life?
"Well done! Unequivocally, the product will contribute to celiac patients."
Are there differences in different age groups? Different environment? Genetics?
"Genetics affect, the disease is familial, usually if someone in your family is diagnosed with celiac, we examine all the children. For example, several years ago I diagnosed a child in Zefat with celiac disease, his father is very tall but very thin, and when I spoke to him he said he was eating well but he was always thin, he said he had always been weak and feels that he has no energy. I suggested that he do the test and at 43 we discovered that he was suffering celiac disease and lives with it, now he keeps a gluten-free diet and feels much better, the environment does not have any affect."
Does it accompany other diseases?
"Celiac can accompany other diseases involving the immune system, for example diabetes and thyroid problems."
Do you think it is necessary for schools to carry out publicity related to the disease (to raise awareness)?
"Yes it is always good; it can help children with the disease and build their confidence."
In conclusion:
Celiac disease according to the opinion of Dr. Irena can be diagnosed at a very young age and save the child and the family the suffering of biological thinness, swollen belly, weakness, and unexplained abdominal pain. If the family doctor is professional enough and knows the family's medical history, he can make an early detection of the disease. However, if not the disease will be discovered at a later age or will never be discovered. The product we are developing, in her opinion, may resolve celiac patients the dilemma whether to eat a certain product or not. Well done.
Meeting with MP and businessman Dr. Erel Margalit
Dr. Erel Margalit, MP of the 20th Knesset for the Labor Party, a businessman, founder and chairman of the international
capital risk fund JVP, based in Jerusalem, and works actively to promote the city, the Northern and Southern periphery of Israel.
Venture capital fund JVP (Jerusalem Venture Partners). The fund has become one of the largest and most successful in Israel. The fund manages more than 900 million dollars invested in more than 30 Israeli and international start-up companies.
Since its foundation, the Foundation had 26 exits, one of the top exits was the sale of Chromatis to Lucent, in exchange
for Lucent shares at a value of about $ 4.8 billion, the issuance of the business intelligence company QlikTech in 2010 on NASDAQ and using a value of approximately $ 2 billion.
In 2005, the business newspaper Forbes chose Margalit as one of the 50 best venture capitalists in the world, in the list "with the golden touch." In 2010, the newspaper "The Marker" chose him as director of the best venture capitalists in Israel.
Erel met with us several times to check the product,laboratory progress and marketing pace.
In his opinion there are two main reasons for investment: emotionally and mentally. One reason is education; the fact of the initiative coming from youth to help other youth is amazing in his personal opinion. As well as the scientific foundation the kit is based on, it is innovative thinking and exceptional in his opinion. Erel Margalit encouraged us because of us being high school students, and especially because we live in the periphery. In his eyes, the exceptional motivation he saw in us was moving and
gives hope to many other students from the periphery.
The second reason was the economic feasibility of the product - the real need for it in the market. The diagnosis of people
with celiac disease is becoming increasingly prevalent in Israel and around the world. The product's ability to accurately and rapidly identify food ingredients may be beneficial for Celiac Disease patients and save them "unnecessary abdominal pain".
As proof of faith in our product Erel Margalit put some of his precious time to meet with us close to the contest time in his home, he saw the presentation, and he even gave us tips and enlightened us on how to improve the presentation.
Dr. Erel Margalit has become an extremely important supporter of our project and we wish to thank sincerely him for that.
