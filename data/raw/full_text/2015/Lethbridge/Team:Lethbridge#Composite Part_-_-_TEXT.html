Part BBa_K1791001
Part BBa_K1791001 contains two modules, a standard ribosome binding site (RBS) expressing MS2 coat protein and a theophylline ribozyme with a MS2 aptamer at the 3’ end. To express MS2 coat  protein the part utilizes expression of c-terminal 6x His tagged MS2 coat protein under the regulation of  a T7 promoter and a standard Shine Dalgarno sequence followed by a double terminator (BBa_0015).  Downstream of the RBS is a T7 promoter followed by a theophylline ribozyme and a MS2 aptamer at the  3’ end. Coexpression of the two modules results in MS2 binding to the 3’ end of the theophylline ribozyme module which allows for MS2-RNA purification by nickel affinity chromatography, RNA can  then be eluted from the MS2-RNA complex by addition of theophylline.

Part BBa_K1791002
Part BBa_K17910012 contains two modules, a low efficiency ribosome binding site (RBS)  expressing MS2 coat protein and a theophylline ribozyme with a MS2 aptamer at the 3’ end. To express  MS2 coat protein the part utilizes expression of c-terminal 6x His tagged MS2 coat protein under a T7  promoter and a standard Shine Dalgarno sequence followed by a double terminator (BBa_0015).  Downstream of the RBS is a T7 promoter followed by a theophylline ribozyme and a MS2 aptamer at the  3’ end. Coexpression of the two modules results in MS2 binding to the 3’ end of the theophylline  ribozyme construct which allows for MS2-RNA purification by nickel affinity chromatography, RNA can  then be eluted from the MS2-RNA complex by addition of theophylline.
