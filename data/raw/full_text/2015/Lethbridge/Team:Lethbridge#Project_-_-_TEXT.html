Design
Take a look at our project design, including information on Fusarium graminearum, a brief introduction into the RNAi pathway and how we choose the RNA used to target Fusarium graminearum. More information about our project design can be seen here .
Results
How our research went in practice, including cleavage of our theophylline ribozyme, production of our dsRNA and the effects of dsRNA on Fusarium graminearum. Our results can be seen here .
Production
Our inexpensive method of generating dsRNA. More information on how we produced dsRNA can be seen here .
Judging
How we accomplished the bronze, silver and gold medal requirements. More information regarding regarding fulfillment of medal criteria can be seen here .
