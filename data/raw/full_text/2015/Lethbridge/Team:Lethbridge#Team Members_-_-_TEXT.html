Adam Christiansen
3rd Year Computer Engineering Software
2nd Year iGEM
I've competed in iGEM at the high school level, and this is my first year competing in the collegiate level competition.
Currently my interests lay in compiler and language design, however in my spare time I like to play badminton and tennis. After completing my schooling I'd like to find myself working in the automotive industry, particularly with high performance and electric cars.
Angela Micovic
3rd Year Biology
1st Year iGEM
My name is Angela Micovic, and I’m a third year undergraduate student finishing up my Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences. My hope is to eventually go on to study pharmaceutical sciences or some other form of health science.
I joined the team because I was interested in discovering the real-life applications of science that we learn about in lectures and labs at university. I’ve already gained so much experience in my short time of being a member of the 2015 Lethbridge iGEM team and look forward to seeing our final result when we present at the Jamboree!
Chris Isaac
3rd year Biochemistry
4th year iGEM
Hi there. I’ve done iGEM since 2012 and have participated at both the High School and Collegiate levels. In my spare time, I am involved with the AGILITY program at the University of Lethbridge, as well as the Chem/Biochem Club serving as Student Union Representative.
I’m particularly excited by the research coming out of DARPA and Boston Dynamics. Using carefully designed microorganisms, intelligent robots, and a little ingenuity, I think that we can improve things for us down here on Earth, and out in space as well.
In the future I would like to study engineering or innovation law and ethics.
Chris Sehn
4th year General Science
1st year iGEM
Hi, I'm Chris. I'm finishing up my last year of a B.Sc. in general sciences and have enjoyed my first iGEM experience greatly. Biology has become a large interest of mine and I've been developing that interest with experience in various laboratories and projects including iGEM. In my free time I have been teaching myself to program in Python, watching too much Netflix, and praying that snow hits the mountains and sticks this year.

Graeme Glaister
4th year Neuroscience
3rd year iGEM
I enjoy studying protein biosynthesis and my favorite biomolecule is RNA. As with every year in iGEM I look forward to the Jamboree, as it is an opportunity to meet people from around the world and learn about their unique projects. I am also the vice president of the Synthetic Biology club and enjoy playing Starcraft in my spare time (Masters League). I am an expert at creating "Rhys" puns and think of them whenever I can find time (Rhycently, Rhyspect, Rhysist, Rhysese pieces, Rhysults, Rhysearch station).
Jeff Tingley
4th Year Biology
1st Year iGEM
I am a fourth year BSc student majoring in Biological Sciences. This is my first year participating in IGEM; joining to gain experience in the lab and to become more involved in university activities. Working with the team has been a blast, I not only gained wet-lab experience but human practice and business management experience as well. I look forward to the Jamboree and the following IGEM season.
Karin Otero
4th Year Neuroscience
1st Year iGEM
My name is Karin Otero and I'm a fourth year Neuroscience student. This is my first year with the iGEM team and it's been a great experience so far. I particularly enjoyed learning more about RNA biology and its different applications in the agricultural field.
Michelle Kwan
3rd year Biochemistry
1st year iGEM
I jumped at the opportunity to join the Lethbridge iGEM team when I found out that I already had a little experience with what the project is centered around: the fungus Fusarium. I am excited to see how much we can accomplish this year! When I am not at the school I am probably running, cycling, or spending my time with dogs.
Rhys Hakstol
M.Sc. Student, Biochemistry
2nd Year iGEM
A proponent of the Canadian Tuxedo since 2008, I am eagerly awaiting a second Edmonton Oilers dynasty. I’m the proud owner of over a dozen nicknames. When I’m not in the lab I can be found on the basketball court, volunteering with Let’s Talk Science, eating beef jerky, watching Space Jam or having debates about superheroes.

Seme Mate
4th year, General Sciences
1st year iGEM
I’m a general science major in my rookie year of iGEM. I was drawn to the competition through a presentation delivered to my biochemistry class and a desire to become an active member of the scientific community. Some of my current interests outside of iGEM include animal models and artificial intelligence. I look forward to an illuminating experience at this year’s jamboree.
Suneet Kharey
4th year Biology
3rd year iGEM
My name is Suneet and I come from simple beginnings. I am in my last year of studies at the University of Lethbridge. I enjoy everything related to policies and practices, and I’m excited to be involved with this year’s project! When I’m not busy with iGEM, I work with Destination Exploration at the University as a science leader doing science outreach and education. I am also the president of the Univeristy of Lethbridge Synthetic Biology Club.
Taylor Luchanski
3rd year Biology
1st year iGEM
Hey, I'm Taylor Luchanski and I'm in the third year of my undergraduate degree in biological sciences at the U of L. I heard about iGEM in high school and was interested in joining, but this is the first year that I had an opportunity to participate. Outside of my life as a student I am a lifeguard and love swimming and baseball. I am looking forward to being a part of the Jamboree!
Dr. Andy Hudson
Post Doctorol Fellow
1st year iGEM
Greetings! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Lethbridge and my current work focuses on engineering RNA regulators of gene expression. Although this is my first year on an iGEM team, once the words “RNAi pesticides” were spoken, I was eager to jump on board as an advisor! Besides my interest in RNA and synthetic biology, I enjoy playing music, reading, golfing and spending time with family.
Dr. Cesar Rodriguez
Research Faculty, Florida State University
I'm a member of the research faculty in the Biomedical Sciences Department at the Florida State University College of Medicine.  I have the great fortune of intersecting medicine and synthetic biology.  I use an imagine, design, create workflow for developing cell-based therapeutics.
Prior to joining FSU, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Autodesk. I am a co-founder and former co-editor of the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL).  I was an iGEM judge in 2009 through 2013. Beyond pursuing exciting ideas and projects in Synthetic Biology, I enjoy raising two rambunctious daughters, snowboarding, football, computer animation (especially Pixar), electric cars, and travelling.
Dustin Smith
M.Sc. Student, Biochemistry
Hello, my name is Dustin Smith. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and I am a Master’s student majoring in Biochemistry. I’m happy to be back with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team for a fifth year, and as always it has been a great experience. Outside of school my favorite activities are ice hockey, snowboarding, lifting, and recycling the same iGEM bio for multiple years.
Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden
Associate Professor of Physical Biochemistry, University of Lethbridge
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
