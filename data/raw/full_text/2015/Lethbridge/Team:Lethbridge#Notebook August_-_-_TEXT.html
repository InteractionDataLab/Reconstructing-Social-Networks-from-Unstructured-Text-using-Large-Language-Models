E. coli Cell Extract
Preparation of E. coli Cell Extract by Lysozyme
Buffers and solutions: binding/opening buffer DNAse lysozyme sodium deoxycholat
Method
Resuspend the cell pellet in 3.5mL of binding/opening buffer by stirring the mixture slowly on ice.
Add 350μL of lysozyme and incubate the cell suspension on ice for 30 minutes
Add sodium deoxycholat (12.5mg/g)
Stir the mixture slowly on ice
Add few crystals of DNAse while stirring
Remove debris by centrifugation at 3000g for 30 minutes at 4°C
Collect the supernatant (cell lysate) in fresh tube
Centrifugation for 45 minutes at 30,000g will result in the S-30 extract
0.5g of cells per tube
