I am excited to see how much we can accomplish this year! When I am not at the school I am probably running, cycling, or spending my time with dogs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="member_rh" class="team_member"><DIV><H2>Rhys Hakstol</H2><P>M.Sc. Student, Biochemistry</P><P>2nd Year iGEM</P><P>A proponent of the Canadian Tuxedo since 2008, I am eagerly awaiting a second Edmonton Oilers dynasty. I’m the proud owner of over a dozen nicknames. When I’m not in the lab I can be found on the basketball court, volunteering with Let’s Talk Science, eating beef jerky, watching Space Jam or having debates about superheroes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="member_sw" class="team_member"><DIV><H2>Scott Wong</H2><P>M.Sc Student, Neuroscience</P><P>3rd year iGEM</P><P>I kill an ant</P><P>and realize my three children</P><P>have been watching.</P><P> - Kato Shuson</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="member_sm" class="team_member"><DIV><H2>Seme Mate</H2><P>4th year, General Sciences</P><P>1st year iGEM</P><P>I’m a general science major in my rookie year of iGEM. I was drawn to the competition through a presentation delivered to my biochemistry class and a desire to become an active member of the scientific community. Some of my current interests outside of iGEM include animal models and artificial intelligence. I look forward to an illuminating experience at this year’s jamboree.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="member_sk" class="team_member"><DIV><H2>Suneet Kharey</H2><P>4th year Biology</P><P>3rd year iGEM</P><P>My name is Suneet and I come from simple beginnings.

Student, Biochemistry</P><P>Hello, my name is Dustin Smith. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and I am a Master’s student majoring in Biochemistry. I’m happy to be back with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team for a fifth year, and as always it has been a great experience. Outside of school my favorite activities are ice hockey, snowboarding, lifting, and recycling the same iGEM bio for multiple years.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="member_hj" class="team_member"><DIV><H2>Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden</H2><P>Associate Professor of Physical Biochemistry, University of Lethbridge</P><P>Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
