Judging Criteria
Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We registered, had a great summer, and are looking forward to the Jamboree!
Complete the Judging form.
Complete!
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Created an iGEM wiki and registered parts: BBa_K1791000 , BBa_K1791001 and BBa_K17910002
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
Poster complete!
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Attributions page complete! Check it out here!
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
BBa_K17910001 is a standard RBS expressing MS2 Coat protein ribozyme affinity purification (RAP).
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
BBa_K17910002 is a low RBS expressing MS2 Coat protein ribozyme affinity purification (RAP).
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.)
Part successfully added to the parts registry!
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
RNAiCare has huge implications for our environment and we've taken great care to address these issues. Please check out our Practices page!
Gold
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
Design of our RNA sequences were ran through BLAST in order to limit off-target effects of our design. Our design was ran by researchers and farmers to discuss the safety and concerns of our project. Please check out our risk assessment here!
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Collaboration with the Lethbridge High School iGEM team can be seen on our Collaborations page. Please give it a look here!
