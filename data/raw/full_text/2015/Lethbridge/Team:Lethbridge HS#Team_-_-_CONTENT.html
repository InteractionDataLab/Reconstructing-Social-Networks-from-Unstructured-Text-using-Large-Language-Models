I joined iGEM because I find the field of synthetic biology very fascinating. I also want to gain more experience in lab work, which is my favourite aspect of iGEM. However, the Human Practices component of iGEM interests me very much as well. In the future I would like to continue to perform experiments and venture out into the biomedical field. In addition to iGEM, I also enjoy playing the clarinet and going camping with my fellow Girl Guides.

I joined the Lethbridge iGEM team because of the unique experience it offers. The opportunity came up a short while after I discovered what synthetic biology is and I was psyched to learn more. It is incredible that a team of high school students and a few advisors can create innovative solutions to world problems. I love getting involved in various activities, including sports, volunteering, and visual arts. A belief I hold close is that learning is the best part of any activity, which makes IGEM all the better.

Hi! My name is Arashk Ghasroddashti and I'm currently in my grade 11 year at the Lethbridge Collegiate Institute. I joined iGEM so that I could experience the amazing opportunities that synthetic biology has to offer, first hand. In addition, getting a chance to work with a team in all sorts of different environments (lab, planning meets, work groups, etc.) has been absolutely invaluable! I plan to eventually move onto university where I will study a field with a strong focus in biology and (hopefully), in the end become some sort of surgeon. Things I enjoy include Judo, computer work, business, movies and of course, learning about the sciences.

I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
