The Lethbridge High School iGEM has helped our team immensely with design and coding of the Collegiate wiki. Constructive feedback was given during meetings, to which coding help was given by a member of the High School team. The Lethbridge collegiate iGEM team also assisted the Lethbridge High School team with their hosting of a wet-lab workshop designed to teach basic wet lab protocols to High School iGEM teams all across Alberta. Five high school iGEM teams (Consort, Our Lady of the Snows, Ted Harrison, Central Memorial High School, Lethbridge) were in attendance for the two day event.  Protocols of ligations, making competent cells, transformations, minipreps, and gel electrophoresis were taught to name a few.
In addition to our collaboration with the U of L High School team, we organized and hosted an Alberta-wide workshop designed to provide iGEM teams with experience presenting and give feedback on project ideas and techniques. The collegiate team from NAIT participated and offered assistance and feedback during the two day event. Experts from across North America were present, and the experience was beneficial for all parties involved. In concert with our High School collaboration, we forged an important link between our team and the Government of Canada agency for Agriculture and Agri-Food. As our project deals directly with crop protection, we have been fortunate to gain access to a pest species of Fusarium on which to test our constructs. As part of this collaboration we have had an opportunity to engage a wide network of faculty and support staff at the Lethbridge Research Centre and receive feedback and suggestions from individuals with decades of relevant experience.
In addition to these collaborations, our team has participated in several surveys that were conducted by other iGEM teams from around the world. In total, we participated in five surveys that were created by the following teams: Paris-Saclay, Nankai, NEFU China, BNU China, and Korea U Seoul. The BNU China survey related most closely to our own project in that questions were posed about agricultural disasters, pesticides, and our government’s policies on biosafety and farmer’s rights to use pesticides. NEFU China, Korea U Seoul, and Nankai teams posed more general questions about our overall knowledge and experience with synthetic biology, and Wiki building. The Paris-Saclay survey posed questions regarding chassis organisms and safety concerns that arise from working with such organisms.
