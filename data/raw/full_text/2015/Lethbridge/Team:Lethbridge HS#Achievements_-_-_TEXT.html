Achievements
Bronze:
Our team successfully registered for iGEM.
We had a great deal of fun during the summer and can’t wait to attend the Jamboree!
All of the required forms, including the judging and consent forms, were completed and sent in.
We completed a description of our project, which can be viewed on our team wiki. Our parts were submitted to the iGEM registry.
We included an attributions page on our wiki.
We created a poster for our project and it will be presented during the poster session at the Jamboree.
Our iGEM team was mentored by the Collegiate Team at the University of Lethbridge. They helped us with procedures and in designing our constructs.In addition to the Collegiate team, we hosted a high school iGEM workshop in February to help other iGEM teams in Alberta learn laboratory skills that they would need.
Silver:
We submitted the following parts to the iGEM Registry:BBa_K1792002 (Dextranase), and BBa_K1792004 (Nuclease).
We characterized our BBa_K1792000 (PDP) part.
We completed many human practice endeavors for our projects.
Gold:
We created an innovative human practices activity by creating a petition about amending the urban beekeeping bylaw in our community and distributing “seed bombs” to the public to encourage the growth of bee-friendly places within our city.
We hosted a workshop at the University of Lethbridge where the Central Calgary High School team, Consort Alberta High School team, and the OLS Canmore High School team were taught basic laboratory techniques, such as pipetting, miniprepping, and ligating that are essential to the lab component of iGEM.
