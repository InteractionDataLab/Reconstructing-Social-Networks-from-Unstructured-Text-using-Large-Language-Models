Overview
All wet lab experiments are hosted at the University of Lethbridge Chemistry and Biochemistry department. The lab itself is a Containment Level One which “requires no special design features beyond those suitable for a well-designed and functional laboratory. Containment is achieved through the use of practices normally employed in a basic microbiology laboratory.” - Public Health Agency of Canada

Other precautions are taken to further provide a safe work environment for team members. Prior to any lab work students are required to come in lab-appropriate attire meaning long pants and closed toed shoes and tied-back long hair. Further equipment is given to the student for extra protection such as lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves. All labs at the University of Lethbridge is equip with fire extinguishers, emergency showers, eye wash stations, and first aid kits in case of dire situations. WHMIS training is provided to all students before any wet lab experiments, and advisor supervision is provided at all times to further ensure safety.
To address biosafety, the University of Lethbridge has a Risk and Safety Services committee tasked with ensuring a safe work environment is upheld by all labs within the institution. The goal of the committee is to “... educate, mentor, foster and grow an environment to all members of the University of Lethbridge community where each accepts an individual and shared responsibility in growing a culture that is rich in the assessment , management and control of risk and safety.” - U of L Risk and Safety Services.

The Risk and Safety committee is aware of Lethbridge High School iGEM and of our project. They support our work as long as we follow the Laboratory Safety Guidelines outlined by Health Canada: Public Health Agency of Canada.

In terms of organisms, we worked with Bees (Apis mellifera) and Mites (Varroa destructor), and a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli known as DH5alpha. According to the World Health organization this strain is rated as a Risk level One - a microorganism unlikely to cause human or animal disease.
For bees, once removed from the colony the bees (contaminated with mites) are then placed in hard-walled tubes in the field and sealed before being transported from the hive to the University. The bees remain in these sealed tubes for the duration of all testing. Bees are fed sugar water laced with E. coli containing our Oxalic acid producing part. The Bees will then be visually inspected for mite infections. Mites are obligate parasites of Bees and all colonies have some level of mite infection. Removed mites due within 24 hrs of removal from a Bee host.
It should be noted that the Nuclease (BBa_K1792004) and Dextranase (BBa_K1792002) protein origin come from level 2 organisms (Canadian rating) but the proteins themselves when isolated are nonpathogenic.  The Petal Death Protein (BBa_K1792000) is produced in small quantities in E. coli so there is no risk of acid burns while working with the construct.
