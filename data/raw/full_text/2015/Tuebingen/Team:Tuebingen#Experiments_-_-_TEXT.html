Cells were measured undiluted or in 1:2 dilution in 96 well plates (black, flat bottom)
Following excitation and emission wavelengths were used for the different fluorescent proteins:
GFP
Exc: 488 nm
Em: 520 nm
Dronpa
Exc: 503 nm
Em: 535 nm
RFP
Exc: 584 nm
Em: 616 nm
Fluorescence was measured with Tecan plate reader (Infinite M200) and analysed with Tecan i-control v1.10
> Fluorescence Microscopy
Sample preparation
A thin layer of low melting agarose was supplied on glass slides
10 µl Yeast cells grown overnight were inoculated in the solidified agarose
samples were used for microscopy after at least 30min incubation at 30° in a humid environment
Microscopy Setup
We used a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective. All pictures were taken   with one active fluorescent channel and brightfield channel. Dronpa was observed by using a 514 nm laser (2% power) for   excitation, and RFP was observed by using a 633 nm laser (2% power) for excitation
Dronpa Illumination
Illumination of dronpa was performed in vivo using a 488 nm argon laser at 50% power for off switching and a 405 nm   for on switching of fluorescence. The illumination of cells was either performed using continuous illumination for 10 to   20 seconds or by performing a line scan with the illumination laser.
