Adrian
During the day, Msc Bioinformatics student with an interest in statistics; at night a pen&paper master.
Cellfie
Professor Dr. Cell F.IE. for Biochemistry, Biology and Bioinformatics. Works in lab.
Daniela
I am a 4th semester bachelor student, Biochemistry, and love especially ballroom dancing but also reading books, playing games, making music, learning languages and lots of other things. Unfortunately a day is short.
Jens
I'm a 4th semester bachelor student of Biology. My main interest lies in genetics/genetic engineering. I enjoy meeting friends, spending time in nature and doing sports.
Katerina
I'm a BSc student of biology in my fourth semester and hope to continue to an MSc degree when I'm done. I enjoy learning more about nature and languages, as well as painting and crafting in my free time.
Katharina
I am doing my master's degree in Biochemistry, currently finishing the second semester. When I am not studying, I like to read books and listen to music, playing games (both digitalÂ and analogue) or cook/bake.
Kevin
I am in the third semester of my biochemistry master. In my free time I love to play and watch soccer, enjoy various sports and like to play different games.
Laura
At the moment I am doing the research for my master's thesis in developmental biology. When I am not in the lab, I love to read (if I find time somewhere), I like to play card games & meet up with friends and enjoy life at the barn with my horse.
Lisa
I am a MSc student in Biochemistry currently finishing the second semester. In my freetime, I enjoy doing different sports, photography and travelling.
Milena
I'm a bachelor student of biochemistry. I've almost finished my fourth semester. Next semester I would like to concentrate on neurological issues. In my free time I like horse riding and doing sports outside.
Nicolai
I am a master's student in Biochemistry currently in my fourth year in University. I like reading an playing games - each digital and offline, furthermore I like rowing and ballroom dancing.
Nikolas
I just finished my bachelor degree in biochemistry, starting a master program in pharmaceutical scienes and technology this fall. Outside of university I enjoy skiing, soccer, caking and ballroom dancing.
Philipp
I'm currently finishing up my second year of iGEM and the sixth semester of my biochemistry bachelors program. Aside from that I make time to enjoy any combination of food, hikes and movies with friends, my girlfriend and family.
Sarah
I'm a 4th semester bachelor student of Biology and it's my fist time at iGEM. In my freetime I love meeting friends, playing handball and travelling.
Simon
I am currently finishing my bachelor's degree in biochemistry, starting a master's program in Marburg. Outside the lab, I like playing the piano, cooking or meet up with friends.
Stefanie
I am a 4th semester bachelor student of Biochemistry and this is my first year of iGEM. I like to spend my free time with reading books, swimming and playing digital and offline games.
Tim
Hi, Tim here. I joined the iGEM team due to my interest in synthetic biology and in general understanding how systems work. This interest spawned from my coding hobby, since I was searching for new challenges. Besides this, I enjoy cooking, tinkering and having a good talk.
Viktor
I am a bachelor student in Biochemistry, currently finishing my fourth semester. Besides studying I like taking pictures, playing drums, cycling, cooking and last but not least reading and writing Wikipedia articles.
Vivien
I'm currently finishing the second semester of my master's degree in Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology and working as a student assistant in an immunology research group. Besides, I also love playing strategy games with my friends, ballroom dancing, reading books and playing video games.
Yvonne
I'm a bachelor student of biology, currently finishing my 4th semester. I joined the iGEM Team for the first time this year to learn more about synthetic biology and working in a lab.In my freetime I enjoy reading books, drawing, and meeting friends.
