Thank you to everyone who helped us and Cellfie to our goal!
Thanks to Prof. Dr. Alfred Nordheim of the Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, Prof. Dr. Oliver Kohlbacher of the Center for Bioinformatics and Prof. Dr. Ralf-Peter Jansen of the Interfaculty Institute for Biochemistry at the University Tuebingen for making the participation in iGEM possible and giving us advice on our project idea.
There were many other people and research groups that helped us, so we also thank
AG Feil (special thanks to Barbara) for everything
AG Jansen for their yeast
AG García-Sáez, especially Aida, for microscopy
AG Schwarzer for lab materials
PD Dr. Elisabeth Fuss for materials and several other things
PD Dr. Frank Essmann from AG Schulze-Osthoff for primer and gel documentation
Dr. Christoph Schall from AG Stehle
Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rothbauer for the GFP-trap
Prof. Dr. Ulrike Zentgraf for lab materials
Prof. Dr. Frank Edenhofer for the use of his cell-penetrating Cre recombinase
Dr. Kai Braun from AG Meixner for providing equipment and expertise to build the monochromator device
Organisation
Daniela Nguyen, Nikolas Layer, Philipp Mayer did our general organisation, from organizing weekly meetings to coordination groups to communicating with the university and other institutions.
Project idea
Even though the whole team was involved in the development of the project idea, special thanks to Katharina Sporbeck and Nicolai von Kuegelgen of the team for developing our project idea with special efforts.
Lab work and summercamp
Without our lab team, Kevin Sabath, Katharina Sporbeck, Nicolai von Kuegelgen and Lisa Wellinger we would not have the results we have and also our summercamp would have not existed - from organizing the camp to instructing and showing the bachelor students how to work in a lab everything was done by them.
Fundraising
Nicolas Layer, Daniela Nguyen, Edwin Schmierer (GoCoTe e.V.) were responsible for fundraising, prepared and wrote e-mails to many companies as well as organizing "Kleinkampftage".
Wiki and homepage
Tim Kucera and Daniela Nguyen build wiki and homepage and fed them with contents.
Design and drawings
In times of waiting and boredom we had so much fun because of Cellfie and his colleagues. Without Katerina Romanova and Yvonne Thoma Cellfie and his Cellvengers would not exist as well as our wiki graphics.
Human Practices
Jens Reich organized our SynBio Day in the historic center of Tuebingen and with Sarah Roffeis the participation in a scientific speed dating in Freiburg. Also Sarah managed the programm during our summercamp and saw to it that we had a lot of fun. They both put much effort in inviting a school class to our lab and delivering them an insight into the world of synthetic biology. In addition they organized our School class@lab project day together with Vivien Weber and Philipp Mayer who communicated with the iGEM Team and the school class teacher.
Modeling
Adrian Geissler wrote and implemented all our modeling codes and helped with general data analysis.
Cooperation
Vivien Weber communicated with our cooperation partners.
We definitely want to mention those who did us an incredible favour by supporting us financially - without you we would not have been able to do any of the work we did:
Deanery of the Mathematics and Science Faculty of the University Tuebingen
Prorektor Forschung of the University Tuebingen
Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, University Tuebingen
SFB685 Immunology, University Tuebingen
PROMOS foundation
Boehringer Ingelheim
Kreissparkasse Tuebingen
Same goes for those who supported us with lab materials - thank you very much!
