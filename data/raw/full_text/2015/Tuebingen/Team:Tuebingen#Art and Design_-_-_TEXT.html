In hours of waiting and creativity Yvonne and Katerina created our Cellvengers. They accompanied us in times of hardship and in times of joy and became our dear friends. Let us introduce... the Cellvengers!

Achievements
We were able to design a fully functional cre reporter cassette and transformed a functional Cre recombinase, which we could show by Luciferase assays. We could show that Dronpa is photoswitchable and built a device which could theoretically photoactivate Dronpa, if using higher light intensities. We could show this using fluorescence microscopy.
We constructed a caged Cre recombinase, which is inactivated by dimerizing Dronpa proteins, attached at N- and C-terminus by linkers with varying length.
We improved the already in the registry existing pRS315 ( BBa_K106006 ) part by removing all RFC10 restriction sites in the plasmid backbone and replacing the MCS. Furthermore, we modified the pRS313 and pRS316 plasmid in the same way
We improved the characterization of the Split-Intein( K1483003 )-NAGA ( BBa_K1483000 ) construct by expressing the construct and showing that the Split-Intein is working.
We improved the characterization of the pSUC promotor ( BBa_K950003 ) part by using different sugars and concentrations
We improved the characterization of the pFET3 promoter ( BBa_K950000 ) and the mPRs ( BBa_K950006 and BBa_K950007 ) by co-transfecting yeast cells with these constructs and observe the effect of the mPRs on the pFET3 promoter
We shipped a total of 27 parts to the registry (part numbers BBa_K1680000 to BBa_K1680027 )
We collaborated with Team Freiburg, Team TU_Darmstadt and Team Valencia_UPV. Team Freiburg received the Spy-peptide from us to use in their experiments, while we helped TU Darmstadt with their LabSurfing study. Team Valencia_UPV and we collaborated on the modelling part.
