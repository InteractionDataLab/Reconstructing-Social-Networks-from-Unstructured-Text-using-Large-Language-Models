Economic Potential Analysis
An economic rationale analysis for investing in the use of micro-organisms for                 the production of artificial bone implants
Because our research contributes to the base of fundamental knowledge, it could                 be used as preliminary research for many applications. A brief look into the                 future potential, from an economic perspective, could possibly offer the                 rationale for a deeper research into the application. As we will see, there are                 many opportunities and challenges that pop up and need to be addressed, even in                 this early stage of the project. The main goal of this potential analysis is to construct a                 bridge between the pure scientific research and the commercial environment,                 resulting in a marketable product. In this analysis, we mainly focus on the use                 of Spot E.Shape principles to discover novel ways of producing artificial bone                 replacements . A similar analysis can be made for each of the other                 applications of the project. For more details on the other applications, please go to the application page.

A deeper understanding of the market and industry dynamics in the bone-implant                 industry
Nowadays, elderly people are more active than ever before. They cycle, play                         tennis, go swimming, travel, etc. Besides, they do not want to give up on those                         activities because of their age. Nevertheless, the risk of accidents with                         possibly serious health consequences and broken limbs grows with age.                         Approximately 1% of all falls of elderly people result in a hip fracture with an                         acute mortality of 3%-5%. (2)
The ageing population and active life-style trends are two major driving forces                 for the demand of orthopaedic devices. Apart from that, the medical world is                 confronted with an increasing number of obesity and osteoporosis patients. These                 factors result in an enhanced growth of the orthopaedic industry. Medical device                 companies respond by continuously looking for new ways of treating fractured                 bones in order to reduce the curing time and to obtain a more performant device.
A closer look into the industry dynamics reveals that the industry is highly                 regulated and very dynamic where most of the industry players are                 well-established small and medium-size enterprises (SME’s). A start-up company                 often needs a significant better product to gain some market share in the                 medical device industry. Many of them choose to first enter a niche market to                 establish some early market share. Once they obtained a solid position in the                 industry, they can broaden their horizon by reaching out to new, unexplored                 markets.
Relevance of using traditional materials for bone implants
Traditionally orthopaedic devices have titanium alloys as the dominant material                 used in most artificial bone implants. However alternatives with new and better                 functions, lower failure rates and less resource demanding are finding their way to the industry. One                 of the most promising examples is tissue engineering where the cells from a                 patient or a donor are isolated. Thereafter, they are combined with                 biomaterials, grown in laboratories and then implanted into the patient. This approach is becoming more and more               a reality due to technological advancements. However there are some major concerns and drawbacks that prevent this technology to  really break through in the market for medical devices. The limited viable window from the point of extraction                 of cells to the reintroduction makes this technology less flexible. (9) The transportation of these cells to and from the laboratory is also a huge                 challenge. Besides, the storage of tissue engineered products (TEP) at a                 constant temperature of -32°C puts pressure on the cost-efficiency. (9) On top of that, TEP's in Europe suffered a lot under the                  the lack of regulation. They are beyond the medical device regulation and the                 pharmaceutical regulation. (9) This ambiguity concerning the regulation               in Europe leads to a strong delay in market introduction. At the moment there is no                 dominant supply model based on mass production due to capacity limitations. This                 prevents TEP’s from really breaking through and becoming the industrially                 standard technology. (9)
In the last decade, composite materials, polymers and ceramics steadily found                 their way to the medical device industry. This is mainly due to the lower                 failures rates, recalls and weight. Most materials also suffer from substantial wear effects.The particles that come loose during the process could possibly have a negative effect on the human health.    The trend to use more eco-friendly and less scarce materials which are produced in a sustainable way is pushing the need for new materials. With our Spot E.Shape project,                 we would like to take this to the next level by imitating the natural bone                 structure as much as possible through the use of micro-organisms.
The positive consequences of using micro-organisms for bone engineering
Spot E.Shape can be used for the construction of a wide range of bone prosthesis. Here we focus on                 hip prosthesis. These are of particular interest because they still result in a high acute mortality rate and the risk of complications serious shortens the life expectancy of the patient. Thus it is useful to look for new ways to produce hip implants.
Recently, surgeons are using a 3D printed implants made of titanium, polymers or                 ceramics for hip transplantations. Here the patient’s CT scan is used to design                 an exact replica of the femoral head. Our project could optimize this design by                 using bacteria that form and precipitate calcium phosphate in a controlled way.                 From there a porous, spongy structure similar to the bone can be formed. It's possible that these bacteria have to be supported by some structure (e.g. titanium frame) to receive the necessary characteristics for the hip implant.                  Thereafter, this technique can also be used as a surface coating for the titanium alloy, so that the wear effects will be far less.
In order to identify and deal with the competitive implications of the so called                 salient attributes, we used the ACE Matrix (Attribute Categorization and                 Evaluation) by Ian C. MacMillan and Rita Gunther McGrath (7) applied to our                 orthopaedic device. The columns refer to the level of energy the attribute                 generate for the customer while the rows refer to the sentiment it provokes. (7) This analytic tool serves to identify the right mix and dynamic fit between                 the customer needs and the attributes of the product. (7) Particularly                 interesting are the powerful energizers that often become the determining factor                 for the purchase decision. The layer of calcium deposited by the bacteria can be                 seen as a coating for the titanium structure which reduces substantially the                 amount of constraint and wear of the prosthesis (Energizer). Wear is something that more                 traditional metallic and polyethylene prosthesis have to deal with. Other reasons why customers would be willing to buy our product (compared to the competitor's one), are its eco-friendliness and low material cost (possibly lower price).

An important issue is that dissatisfiers can encourage the customers (mostly                 surgeons) to opt for a competitor which reduces customer loyalty. (7) In the                 case of our medical device, it is crucial to conduct long-term experiments to                 test possible health effects. The process of bacteria removal could also evoke serious customer concerns which could lead customers to choose for a competitor. An effective method in combination with lots of customer information campaigns are two ways to deal with this dissatisfier. Additionally already in the prototyping phase, we                 need to start thinking about possible ways to automate and fasten the production                 process. This could reduce the price of the product and at the same time the wait-to-delivery time.                  On the other hand, a competitor’s action can turn a                 tolerable into a dissatisfier, e.g. the competitor eliminates a negative                 characteristic. To be one step ahead of competition, we need to monitor continuously our product quality.
We have to remark that the validation phase concerning the customer perceptions                 of attributes still needs to be performed. Keep also in mind that this analysis                 is a foresight for a medical device application, which implies that at this                 stage, not every attribute can be proved scientifically.
Barriers for the market introduction of orthopaedic materials based on                 micro-organisms
Introducing a brand new technology often comes with some major challenges to                 overcome. In this section, we are focusing on the different potential issues                 that need to be addressed in further stages of the project. We identify three of                 them, namely the financial gap, regulation gap and human capital gap.
Financial gap
Orthopaedic research is often time-consuming and requires a substantial                 investment during the development, production and distribution phase before it                 can be translated into a final product for patient care. (1) During the current                 proof-of-concept phase of the project, we already experienced a clear need for                 financials. Radical innovations typically need large investments in further                 technological development before a first working prototype can be constructed                 and tested. (4) From the perspective of potential investors, there is a lot of                 uncertainty about the outcome which will probably lead to a long payback time                 and thus few economic incentives to invest in this early stage of the project. (12) The phenomenon of investor reluctance is often described as ‘the financial                 barrier’ which plays a role on the level of private financiers, such as banks                 and venture capital firms. (6) The need for government stimulants through                 specialised funding programs is clearly present. (10) This is underlined by the                 fact that publicly funded venture capital firms are more willing to consider                 investing in early-stage university spin-outs than private ones. (5)
Next is the pre-seed funding phase that further explores                 managerial and organisational aspects of the project in order to make it more                 attractive for potential investors. (10) In the proof-of-concept phase,                 government funding mainly serves the role of reducing the technological                 uncertainty while the reduction of the organisational uncertainty is mainly the                 purpose of pre-seed funding. For this phase we are currently fully relying on                 sponsorship from the industry and university organisations. The option of applying for a governmental grant remains possible for further stages.
The third major phase or seed phase takes place when the company is established,                 but basically it does not generate enough cash flow to survive on its own. For                 their early investments, investors are often given an equity stake in return.                 Attracting venture capital investors remains difficult because they prefer to                 invest in university spin-outs after the seed phase, when the research and                 following application proved to be robust. (14) Possible investors should be                 found in the industry, angel investors, crowd funding, government, etc.
When a company grows, at some point in time there will be an immediate financial                 need that is too high to bear for traditional investors. Often regional and                 national venture capital firms are then the only option to turn at. However                 involving venture capital firms should be a well-considered decision. They bring along a                 new working culture, make demands (e.g. hiring professional managers and                 administrators) and put pressure on the firm to get the necessary in-house                 competences. All of this is done with respect to the return-on-investment they                 need so desperately regarding their 10-year horizon. (13) This could lead to tremendous progress for the company or they can break up with the                 company in the long term if they don't receive a high enough return-on-investment. (13)
Regulation gap
A lack of regulation can be considered as double-edged, where it shortens the                 product innovation cycle but at the same time makes marketing your product more                 complicated. Orthopaedic devices are normally classified as a medical device                 and fall within the European medical device regulation. To be issued with a CE                 mark, medical devices must achieve high quality, safety and performance                 standards. (9) However the specificity of our device, which is based on the                 precipitation by bacteria, could possibly be subject to the regulation of                 genetically modified organisms. The narrow legal framework concerning GMO's in                 Europe could affect and delay the innovation process of our orthopaedic device.                 The ambiguity and lack of clarity to which regulation our application can be                 applied, shows the need for the realignment of regulation with practice and                 current state-of-technology. (3)
Human capital gap
Knockaert et al. suggested that “One of the principal challenges facing                 university spin-outs is academic entrepreneurs tending to possess little                 commercial human capital.” (5) The fact that they are experts in their domain                 does not make them the perfect marketers for their product. As showed above, the                 orthopaedic industry is characterised by a certain set of aspects. Appropriate                 managers will more likely find more adapted ways of dealing with these                 differences. Besides there are possible conflicts of interest with the                 traditional roles of research and teaching that might pop up when academic                 entrepreneurs need to run a business. (10) Raising venture capital should also                 be done by an entrepreneur who possesses lots of commercial human capital. This                 shows clearly that the different challenges are interrelated. (5)
Desired approach for the market introduction
The orthopaedic device industry is currently confronted with a rising demand for                 new orthopaedic hip prosthesis. To deal with this, we came up with a brand                 new device based on the use of bacteria. However we described three major                 barriers that can potentially disturb the realization of its economic potential.                 The purpose of this section is not to provide an exhaustive description of a                 go-to-market-strategy or business plan, but rather briefly offering some                 guidelines that need to be kept in mind to secure a bright future perspective.
Parallel to tissue engineered products, where they also work with cells (10) , the                 end product is highly customized and falls under the ‘Make to Order’ approach.                 In view of the high demand of orthopaedic products, this will not be sufficient                 to establish a competitive supply model that is capable of gathering a                 significant part of the market. The way to deal with this obstacle should be to                 identify all the parts that can be automated and scaled-up already in an early                 stage of the development process in order to satisfy a mass market. (10) In order to commercialize the device, there should also be thought off patenting                 the invention. The Bayh–Dole-inspired legislation made this possible for                 universities and was adopted by many countries in their national regulation. (9)
There comes a time when you can not do everything on your own anymore,                 especially in an industry where multiple disciplines overlap and different                 competences are needed. The interdisciplinary aspect is one way                 to explain the search for the right strategic partner to forge an alliance with.                 The reduction of technological uncertainty in the early phases of a project                 could be a second reason for collaboration with a partner from industry. (10) This will make the search for potential investors a lot easier and reduce the                 time-to-market for the application. This is also often the phase where a                 university spin-off is created, which acts like an independent business.

Anecdotal evidence states that it is very hard to become profitable as a company                 from the start. However the goal of taking market share by aiming at a niche market is                 a much more realistic objective than reaching a positive cash flow. Once this is                 obtained, the company will be considered as an interesting investment for the                 big medical device companies which will be eager to take over the company.                 However if the ultimate goal of market share is not reached, the company will                 not generate a breakthrough and succumb rapidly. (13)
