Creating an iGEM project requires hard work in many fields. Obviously research in literature, simulations executed by the modeling team and practical work in the wet lab are necessary. We also want to pass our knowledge to future generations and iGEM teams. Therefore we develop a wiki, communicate our project in the media and teach primary and highschool students more about our project and synthetic biology in general. Above all, we want to organize an ethical debate because by discussion, you get a deeper insight in different opinions. To realise all this in a structured manner, we need a cooperation between all team members and subteams. We want to keep you up to date by sharing our journal and timeline.
