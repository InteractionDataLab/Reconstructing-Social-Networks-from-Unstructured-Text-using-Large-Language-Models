We designed a circuit capable of forming patterns in a controlled way. Using a modified and temperature-sensitive lambda repressor (cI), we can trigger formation at desired points in time. This time-dependent controllability, together with the possibility to change many different parameters and output signals, leads to an enormous tunability in the creation of the patterns. Our mechanism will stimulate advancements in a variety of industrial processes like the creation of novel bio-materials. This fundamental project could also speed up medical research projects like tumor formation.
Idea
A detailed description about the interaction between our two cells and the genetic circuit can be found here.
Methods
Besides an overview of the performed steps to create two different cell types, you can also find a description of the detailed protein quantification methods to determine interesting parameters.
Basic Parts
Our new, self-designed basic parts necessary to control cell-cell interactions and E. Coli motility.
Composite Parts
Our basic parts were combined with each other and with existing iGEM promotors, RBS and terminators.
Results
The results of our experiments will appear here.
