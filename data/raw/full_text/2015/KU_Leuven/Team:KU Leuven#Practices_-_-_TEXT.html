Our work is worth little if our results are not accepted or wanted by the                     public. Therefore learning about the perception of synthetic biology is crucial.                     Additionally, to gain the trust of the public a sound ethical foundation as a                     base for our work is necessary. In our survey we learned, that most people only                     accept synthetic biology if they feel educated about the subject. Therefore we                     went to schools to teach students some synthetic biology fundamentals. Finally                     we collaborated with other iGEM teams which is beneficial for both sides and boosts the impact of our        project.
Survey
We conducted a survey to shed light on the perception of synthetic biology in                                 Belgium.
Public Engagement
How we engaged generally and intra university-wise.
Ethics
What we learned from a panel of experts we invited to discuss ethical and legal                                 questions.
Education
We went teaching and devised an educational card game, which is fun to play.
Collaborations
We collaborated with other teams to improve both projects.
Symposium
We hosted a symposium with other iGEM teams attended and got interesting                                 speakers to broaden our horizons.
