                    Perception of synthetic biology</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="summarytext1"><DIV class="part"><H2>
                Introduction
            </H2><P>
                Can synthetic biology have a positive influence on the environment? Can DNA be
                patented? What kind of applications are socially acceptable? These are the kind
                of questions which often characterize a social debate. The social debate about
                synthetic biology is in a much further stage in the USA than in Europe
                <SUP><A href="#Raeymaekers">[5]</A></SUP>. On top of that, there are numerous important social organisations and
                public groups who didn’t formulate a clear opinion about synthetic biology
                <SUP><A href="#Raeymaekers">[5]</A></SUP>. This implicates that the current debate didn’t evolve in a particular
                direction which makes it even more interesting to carry out a survey on the
                current perception of synthetic biology. This survey was conducted among Belgian
                citizens, older than 18 (focus group) and led to 352 responses.  Download the pdf-survey files in <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/d/d2/KU_Leuven_NED.pdf">Dutch</A>,
      <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/4/43/KU_Leuven_Survey_FRENCH.pdf">French</A>,
      <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/7/71/KU_Leuven_Survey_ENG.pdf">English</A> or <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/2/27/KU_Leuven_GER.pdf">German</A>. In the sample,
                only 2 out of 10 respondents say that they know what synthetic biology stands
                for while 4 in 10 only heard of it. The other respondents have no clue about the
                meaning of synthetic biology. Considering the people who have some sense of what
                synthetic biology means, 46% associate synthetic biology with genetical
                engineering and modification. 32% of the respondents see it as something
                artificial and unnatural. 25% characterise synthetic biology by its applications
                where health care is mentioned in 44% of the cases while agriculture counts for
                24%. A short collection of associations with synthetic biology from the
                respondents can be found in
                <A href="#image1">Figure 1</A></P><DIV class="center"><DIV id="image1"><H4><DIV id="figure1">Figure 1</DIV>

                    </H4></DIV></DIV><P>
                A remarkable fact is that respondents who are not professionally involved in
                synthetic biology, often cite elements of synthetic biology, but they are unable
                to give a comprehensive and clear description. Moreover, there are numerous
                fallacies about synthetic biology which can influence the opinion
                of the general public dramatically. Synthetic biologists often counter the hesitant and
                sometimes negative attitude of individuals with the existence of an information
                gap. This vision is supported by the research of McHughen, indicating the
                fact that people do not possess the necessary knowledge and information to
                formulate a relevant opinion on biotechnology
                <SUP><A href="#McHughen2007">[3]</A></SUP>. But does supplementary information lead to a change in the acceptance
                rate of synthetic biology? After asking the respondents about their opinion on
                synthetic biology, they were given a well-balanced description of synthetic
                biology, including opportunities and threats. There is strong evidence that the
                acceptance level of synthetic biology is significantly different when the
                respondents are given a definition of synthetic biology. <A href="#image2">Figure 2</A> clearly
                shows an increase of 13.5% in the approval rate of synthetic biology which is
                mainly due to the decrease in neutral answers. The decrease in the number of
                neutral answers is most likely due to the fact that informed people make up
                their mind more easily.

            </H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="part"><H2>Not “just” an application</H2><P>A common saying about synthetic biology is that it paves the way for the
            development of a whole range of novel industrial applications in health care,
            biofuels, crop management, etc. However not every application can be valued in
            the same way. Previous research
            <SUP><A href="#Felt2007">[1]</A></SUP><SUP><A href="#Hill1998">[2]</A></SUP>
            showed that the perceived usefulness of knowledge for the individual is crucial
            in his grasps of science and technology. This clearly shows the importance of
            the direct benefits of biotechnological applications to the individual
            <SUP><A href="#Pauwels2013">[4]</A></SUP>. This survey analyses how people evaluate various applications of
            synthetic biology. Although the use of synthetic biology in the human body often
            comes with ethical concerns, we see that 70% of the respondents have no problem
            with the use of synthetic biology to produce medicines, in this case insulin.
            The same can be said about biofuels as an alternative energy source, where
            nearly 50% evaluate it as very positive. The results about the environmental
            technology (reduction of pollutants) and agricultural applications (modified
            crops) show less transparent results, but there seems to be a tendency to
            consider it as a positive development.

                Respondents defining synthetic biology
            </H2><P>
                &quot;I think of producing biological tissues and cells to replace natural and
                depleted resources.&quot;
                &quot;Synthetic biology sounds related to GMO’s where organisms are genetically
                manipulated.&quot;
                &quot;Tweaking the building blocks of life.&quot;
                &quot;It sounds like normal biology, but with adjustments made by human involvement.&quot;
                &quot;I see it as growing things from nothing.&quot;
                &quot;Fine-tuning organisms to combat diseases more efficiently.&quot;
                
                &quot;Artificially producing organs and human body parts.&quot;
                &quot;Synthetic biology makes me think of producing biological components in order to
                mimic and improve biological phenomena, for example tissue regeneration.&quot;
                &quot;Cloning and genetically engineering come to my mind, things that are
                lab-grown.&quot;</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="part"><H2>
            Ethical concerns</H2><P>Synthetic biology often brings along ethical and social issues. At the KU
            Leuven iGEM symposium, a panel of experts in synthetic biology gave already
            their opinion about some ethical and moral questions. But this does not
            necessarily match with the opinion of the general public. Over 70% of the
            respondents see the potential of synthetic biology for the human well-being and
            environment. It is also clear that the patent debate is far from over. There is
            no public consensus about the desirability of patents in synthetic biology, but
            there is a slight tendency towards disapproval.</P></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV id="image3"><H4><DIV id="figure2">Figure 3</DIV>
            Left: Synthetic biology can have a positive impact on the environment., Middle:
            Synthetic biology can have a positive impact on your life.  Right: DNA can be
            patented.
        </H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="part"><P>Even though synthetic biology is a promising field, that doesn’t mean that it
        is everywhere a “hot” topic. As the survey showed, almost 4 in 10 persons do not
        have any idea of its meaning. People that are unfamiliar with synthetic biology
        are often confronted with a lot of personal doubts and concerns. Each respondent
        was therefore asked about the aspect of synthetic biology that he or she wants
        to know more about. 28% of the respondents want to know more about the potential
        risks that come with synthetic biology, especially how the spread and survival
        of genetic modified organisms in nature can be controlled. Besides, 10% of the
        respondents is concerned about the adequacy of the current regulations around
        synthetic biology. 30% would like to know more about the applications and
        possible benefits which can be obtained. A minor 5% would like to know more
        about the scientific and technical aspects of synthetic biology. The doubts
        people have concerning synthetic biology are often considered as a consequence
        of the lack of knowledge and communication which is a popular statement between
        scientists. But what kind of methods are considered as a good way of building
        trust in the view of the respondent? 40% suggest to better communicate and
        inform the general public on what synthetic biology stands for in general. 28%
        specify that the benefits should be showed using applications. Many people
        suggest to use applications that are close to the individual’s every day
        environment where the possible disadvantages should not be neglected but rather
        explained and investigated. 14% of the respondents remarked that more positive
        publicity about synthetic biology is necessary to change the public perception.
        
        There can be concluded that the work is far from done. A large number of people
        do not know anything about synthetic biology while there are still many
        fallacies circulating. Given this observation, we can not just sit back and
        watch the situation from a distance. If we want to make a change, even though it
        is probably a small one, then the only thing we can do is communicating and
        informing people. Or as a respondent puts it: “Unknown equals unloved.”
        Therefore we are visiting schools to educate and introduce children to the world
        of science (see <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Practices/Education">education</A>
        section). On top of that, we created an educative game
        and organised a symposium about synthetic biology (see symposium section),
        complemented by an ethical debate between current leaders, academics as well as
        entrepreneurs, in the field of synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="summaryheader"><DIV class="summaryimg"><DIV class="head"><H2>
