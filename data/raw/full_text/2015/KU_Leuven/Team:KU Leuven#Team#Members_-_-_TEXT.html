Team
This year, our team consists of 13 students who are dedicating their summer to work on the iGEM project. The numerous late night meetings organised from the beginning of the year 2015 were the perfect opportunity to create an optimal atmosphere to discuss the possible iGEM projects and to boost the team spirit. The team consist of students from 5 different faculties with different backgrounds, perspectives, nationalities and languages. The diversity of the team gives us strength and widens our horizons. We are all bounded by our enthusiasm for science and research and each of us possesses the courage to face big challenges. Additionally, we will be supported by previous iGEM’mers and employees from all levels of the KU Leuven University. The previous KU Leuven teams have set high standards to benchmark ourselves against. We will do our best to carry on this trend in the 2015 iGEM competition!

Mentors and Advisors
Johan Robben
Promoter
Professor, Faculty of Science at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
From the very beginning of our project, Johan has always been ready and willing to help us when problems arise. He provided us with work space in the lab and is always ready to share his scientific expertise.
Katarzyna Malczewska
Supervisor
Drs at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
We couldn’t imagine a better supervisor! Be it a scientific question or a silly doubt, an advice or some administration, a hot cup of coffee or just handy tips, she will always know what to do.
Oscar Torres
Advisor
Drs at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Oscar is our knock-out specialist. He helped us with the P1 phage transduction and showed how to confirm our double knock-out. We can always ask him questions during our experiments.
Yves Peeters
Advisor
Drs at the  laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Yves is always willing to provide us with his crystal violet and electrocompetent cells. Above all he is interested in our project and likes to share advice.
Iris Govaerts
Advisor
Technician at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Iris is always there to help us ordering products, searching for sponsors and giving safety advice. She will give us handy hints wrapped up in funny stories.
Veerle De Wever
Advisor
Postdoctoral researcher at Laboratorium voor Biosignalering & Therapeutica
Veerle helped us to choose the right topic. She also guided the previous KU Leuven iGEM team and is happy to pass on her experience by giving practical advice on how to prepare for the Giant Jamboree.
Others
Advisors
We would like to extend our gratitude to our advisors who have been very helpful during various stages of our project. We thank the ex-iGEMmers, the PhD students, professors and laboratory assistants, who participated in our pizza meetings and opening event, for giving their opinion. A special thank to our friends and significant others for their support and help during the opening event.
