Students designed biological systems to make cells blink. The course grew into a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition spread internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, 130 teams in 2010, and 165 teams in 2011. Designs range from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, arsenic biosensors, Bactoblood, buoyant bacteria, etc. </P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>October</H2><P>The search for a new KU Leuven team has started. Ex-iGEM’mers introduced the iGEM competition showing a movie in auditoria.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>November</H2><P>The ex-iGEM’mers and advisors organised information sessions on the 4th, 5th, 13th and 20th of November at different faculties. Candidates could apply untill the 23rd of November by sending their CV and motivation letter.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>December</H2><P>The interviews took place on the 10th and 11th of December and the ‘lucky 13’ team was formed. The first get-to-know-eachother meeting was organized on the 19th of December.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>January</H2><P>‘Exams, Exams, Exams’. January was a quiet month for iGEM, but we had a lovely team and a crazy summer to look forward too.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>February</H2><P>Unleashing the bundled enthusiasm during our first brainstorm session on the 11th of February generated seventeen primary ideas for an unforgettable project. Eventually, we chose eight topics to further research.
</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>March</H2><P>Researching and discussing those eight ideas enabled us to select three top notch projects. After working out these and with the hints of the advisors in our heads, the final topic was chosen. On the 31st of March, all our excitement converged into that one idea; Pattern formation.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>April</H2><P>On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisors. We also organised ourselves into 11 subteams ranging from &quot;Wet lab&quot; and &quot;Modelling&quot; to &quot;Design, photos and arts&quot;.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>May</H2><P>The ’Opening Event’ took place on the 20th of May. Here we introduced ourselves and our topic to the broad public, advisors and potential sponsors.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>June</H2><P>In June, the second exam period required our full attention. Nevertheless, some team members with few exams already explored literature and started looking for sponsors.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION><DIV><H2>July</H2><P>In July, the 'real' work began and the whole team reviewed literature. We theoretically constructed the plasmids and searched quantification methods for specific proteins. The wet lab team started generating double knockout strains and the first mathematical models were made. By developing the wiki and using social media, we kept everybody updated about our latest progress. The Education and outreach team started planning possible collaborations with other teams and was sitting on a bigger plan. On the 21st of July, we met the iGEM-team of Toulouse to discuss our projects. Also practical arrangements for the stay during the Giant Jamboree were made.
