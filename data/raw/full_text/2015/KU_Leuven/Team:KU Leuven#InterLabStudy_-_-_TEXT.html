Interlab Study
This year the KU Leuven iGEM team decided to share its enthusiasm with the other teams to participate in the Interlab Measurement Study. The aim of this study was to construct specific devices combining a promoter with GFP and subsequently measure and analyse the fluorescence. By carrying out this study we want to contribute to the worldwide fluorescence database.
