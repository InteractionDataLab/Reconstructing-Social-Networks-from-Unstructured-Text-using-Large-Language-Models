Symposium
Event summary
On September the 7th, 2015 we organized the KU Leuven iGEM 2015 Symposium on Synthetic Biology, Cell Systems and Ethics in Biochemistry. Hosted guests included 4 neighbouring iGEM teams, academic staff, students, sponsors, and iGEM supporters from 6 different European countries. During this full-day event, the participants had a chance to attend the lectures by home speakers as well as by invited international keynote speakers from both the academia and the industry. The iGEM teams presented their research, and probably the most awaited part - the debate on ethics in biochemistry with panel of well selected experts lead by an experienced professional moderator - took place in the afternoon. To fulfil all the needs, goodie-bags, drinks, lunch, and dinner were provided to our guests. The day finished with a sightseeing walk around Leuven centre. Participation was free of charge. We hosted almost a hundred guests and received a very positive feedback.

Home speaker Vera van Noort talked about lessons from systems biology of a                 minimal organism for synthetic biology. In the EMBL, where she worked, they                 wanted to completely describe one organism, namely Mycoplasma                 pneumoniae. For complete understanding, three different levels were studied:
The metabolism, transcription (regulation) and protein complexes. The take-home                 messages for synthetic biology in short: transcription regulation is more than                 operons and transcription factors; enzymes can catalyse multiple reactions and                 are organized in multi-subunit complexes; proteins can be part of multiple                 complexes and can be regulated by post-translational modifications and small                 peptides are essential.
Victor Dillard, the first keynote speaker, is the                 founder of Desktop Genetics. The company is building software for biologists,                 with a focus on synthetic biology. The software helps to improve the efficiency                 and to lower the costs. He explained that genome editing remains hard and became                 a design and software challenge, and not purely biological challenge. This is                 because genome editing needs to be accurate, precise, effective and rapid.
Sebastian Maerkl, the second keynote speaker, discussed the topic cell-free                 synthetic biology. He explained that microfluidics with cell-free lysate can be                 used for rapid prototyping of biological systems. One of the advantages is that                 it has defined and controllable reaction conditions. In vitro prototyping is                 used to speed up research in synthetic biology. The pipeline of cell-free                 synthetic biology: design a biological circuit, build the circuit, test parts                 and circuits, characterize working circuits, clone and implement in vivo.
The second home speaker, Yves Peeters, gave a talk about directed evolution of                 polymerases using synthetic biology methods. The research of Yves Peeters is                 part of the research domain Xenobiology, creating alternative life, one of the                 approaches of synthetic biology. XNA, also called orthogonal DNA, is designed by                 several labs using different strategies. Making organisms with XNA will be an                 ultimate biosafety tool for synthetic biology. Before being able to have a                 liveable organism that uses XNA, there is a need for polymerases recognizing the                 specific XNA. To create the wanted polymerases, Yves uses directed evolution,                 including mutagenesis, screening, amplification and iteration of the most active                 enzymes.

Speakers
Sebastian Maerkl, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, The                     Laboratory of Biological Network Characterization (LBNC)
Sebastian Maerkl's lab conducts research at the interface of engineering and                 biology and is active in the areas of systems biology, synthetic biology and                 molecular diagnostics. They are driven by the desire to learn how to rationally                 design and engineer biological systems. Sebastian Maerkl’s research aims to                 develop new microfluidic technologies and apply them to solve biological                 problems. His rare expertise allows him to combine the design of new tools with                 advanced research in biology. Sebastian Maerkl is internationally recognized for                 his many outstanding contributions. Particularly in combining synthetic biology                 and computational systems with microfluidics, he demonstrated that the                 expression of genes in vivo can be provided based on the binding energy profiles                 in vitro. His studies will focus on five areas: the bioengineering of                 biosystems, the engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, the                 engineering of genes and genomes, the engineering of biological systems de novo                 and the development of a new generation of diagnostic devices.
Victor Dillard, Chief Operating Officer & Founder, Desktop Genetics
Victor obtained his masters in chemical engineering with honours at Imperial                 College London before completing a specialist biotechnology and business masters                 with distinction at the University of Cambridge. Since graduating, Victor                 founded Desktop Genetics with a vision to change modern biotech R&D and enable                 rapid and accurate end-to-end genome engineering experiments through their                 proprietary software platform. Within two years of founding Desktop Genetics,                 Victor has raised over $600,000 of private equity and grant financing, and                 delivered over $400,000 of revenue. Today, Victor heads the company's business                 development and operations and is leading the product and technology expansion                 into CRISPR and genome editing.
Vera van Noort, Center for Microbial and Plant Genetics
The research group led by Vera van Noort is interested in understanding                 biological systems as a whole. They try to achieve this through computational                 analysis of large-scale data generated by the ever growing number of new                 technologies that can systematically measure the behaviour of multiple cellular                 components, such as biochemical activities, biophysical properties, subcellular                 localization and interaction. They use and develop new methods to integrate,                 visualize and query the large amounts of information available and in such a way                 come to new biological discoveries. A particular focus of the group is                 proteomics and post-translational modifications.
Yves Peeters, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology
After completing his master thesis at KU Leuven, Yves obtained an IWT fellowship                 for his PhD work in the field of synthetic biology. His primary interest goes to                 DNA polymerases and their modifications towards creation of artificial nucleic                 acids.
