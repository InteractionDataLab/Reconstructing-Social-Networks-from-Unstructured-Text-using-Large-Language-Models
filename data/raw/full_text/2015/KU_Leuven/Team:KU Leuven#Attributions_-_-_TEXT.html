Hailing from different backgrounds, the unique capabilities of each of our team members laid a strong foundation for the team to carry out most of the tasks ourselves. We conceived the idea, consulting it with our promoter, supervisor and the other advisers, seeking their valuable feedback. After receiving proper trainings, we proceeded with the experiments on our own.
The implication of the saying 'Rome was not built in a day' can be applicable to our project as well in such a manner, that a project like this takes time and effort and requires a strong and tuned team play. We are proud to communicate that together as a team, we were able to conduct every part of this challenge on our own. Be it a design of the wiki or the scientific illustrations, hours spent in the wet or dry labs, sponsor campaigns or symposium organization, we completed everything ourselves, without the need for any commercial or external assistance, and with only limited supervision.
We extend our gratitude to our sponsors for granting us the required laboratory materials, equipment and, above all, for their financial support throughout the course of our project.
On this page, we would like to thank everyone who contributed to our project.
Wet Lab
Prof. Hideaki Mizuno
Prof. Mizuno shared his knowledge on fluorescent proteins and visualization with us. Thanks a lot!
Vincent Gielen and Sam Duwé
Vincent Gielen and Sam Duwé from Prof. Hofkens' group generously provided us with fluorescein, to generate a standard curve for the interlab measurements.
Centre of Microbial and Plant Genetics (CMPG)
We would like to thank the CMPG lab for their help. Prof. Jan Michiels and Valerie Defraine gave us advice with respect to the AHL detection. Prof. Christine Peeters and Stefanie Roberfroid provided us with the Chromobacterium violaceum (CV026). We received the three knock-out mutants: Δtar, ΔcheZ and Δtsr from Natalie Verstraeten. Thanks to Prof. Jos Desair and Ami De Weerdt we were able to do our leucine detection assay using their microplate reader.
Matthijs Cottignie
Our gratitude goes to Matthijs Cottignie for loaning us his self-made time-lapse photo device to visualise the motility of our cells.
Dry Lab
Prof. Dirk Roose
Prof. Roose from the Department of Computer Science gave us valuable advice on coding and mathematics.
Tim Odenthal
We would like to thank Prof. Herman Ramon and Tim Odenthal for their opinion and suggestions on the hybrid model.
Prof. Marc De Maeyer
Prof. Marc De Maeyer helped us to get the access to the supercomputer center.
VSCentrum
