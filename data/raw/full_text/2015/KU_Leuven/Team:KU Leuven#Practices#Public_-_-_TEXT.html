Our interview with Jo De Wachter!        Their rationale for interviewing us was:
"In order to increase the visibility of our international research projects and the connection with our Master programs         on the website of the Faculty of Science, we have created a new communication and outreach plan. In this plan, designed        by vice-Dean Conny Aerts, several new actions and activities are being developed.         One of the important aspects of this plan is the international reach of our educational programs and research projects,         as displayed on our websites. We have concluded that narratives (attractive personal stories) of         students, researchers and principal investigators of a research team, are the best way to attract more attention to our        websites in order to boost international recruitment of motivated and talented international Master students."

Bringing science closer to the people
One of our main goals was to bring science closer to the people. For this purpose, we have written a text for family, friends and people on Facebook and Twitter in their mother language (NL or EN) to spread the word. You can find this text here .
