Random Data
Hybrid
Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells.
Internal
Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.
FBA (Toulouse)
As a part of our modeling cooperation we exchanged models with the Toulouse                                         team. This is the flux balance analysis they performed for us.
