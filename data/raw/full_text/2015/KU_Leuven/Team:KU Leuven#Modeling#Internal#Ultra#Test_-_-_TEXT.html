Our project
Test test ultra test Patterns are fascinating, from the veins of a leaf to the stripes of a zebra. Patterns are found everywhere in nature, but how they are formed is not entirely clear. We, the KU Leuven iGEM 2015 team, decided to work on the fundamental mechanisms behind pattern formation. The way cells of multicellular organisms interact to generate a specific pattern has triggered our curiosity. Our mission is to create astonishing biological patterns with engineered bacteria on a petri dish to unravel the secrets of nature. We will design a ‘proof of principle’ which can form the basis for fundamental research.
A last message of the team
We are back from the Jamboree!!
We were very happy to present our results to the jury and we got a positive feedback:
First we won a gold medal!!
And we were even nominated for 4 prices in the overgrad section: Best Poster, Best Education and Public Engagement, Best Modeling and Best New Application Project in which we were the runner-up!
We were very happy with these results and want to thank everybody involved who helped us to achieve this! Thank you very much!!
Project
We decided to work on the fundamental mechanisms behind pattern formation. To achieve our goal, the link between wet lab and modeling will be crucial to the successful design of our experiments.
Research
Each experimental step requires a theoretical background.  This background, the protocols and the results of our experiments can be found in this subsection.
Modeling
The modeling team fits models to the data obtained by the wet lab. Synergically, simulations from the cyber lab will aid tuning the experimental conditions that lead to the desirable patterns.
Team
Diverse with respect to thoughts, perspectives, nationalities and languages, yet bound together by our enthusiasm for science and research. Would you like to know more about us?
Notebook
Many small steps need to be taken to achieve our goal. We like to keep you informed and welcome you to discover our newsfeed and history!
