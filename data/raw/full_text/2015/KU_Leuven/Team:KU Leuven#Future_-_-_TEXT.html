Future potential of Spot E.Shape
The knowledge transfer from pure scientific research to the commercial environment is a major challenge to tackle for both academia and industry. By analyzing the future potential of our project, we explore how its scientific contribution could be useful for different industries. The focus lies mainly on the development of artificial bone implants, where the economic rationale for further investments is analyzed combined with a brief description of possible barriers for its future. Other applications for the biomaterial and medical industry are described as well. On top of that, we explain how a future collaboration with the TU Delft iGEM team could be beneficial for the both of us.
