July
During July, the whole team reviewed the literature. We constructed the plasmid and searched quantification methods for specific proteins. The wet lab started with the knock-out of genes for the development of the right strains and the first mathematical models were made. We want to keep everybody updated about our work by using social media and developing the wiki. Education and events for collaboration between different iGEM-teams were planned. Also practical arrangements for the stay during the Giant Jamboree were made. At the 21st of July, we held a meet-up with the iGEM team of Toulouse to discuss our projects.
June
In June, the new exam period arrived. Members with few examens reviewed the literature and start searching sponsors.
May
The ’Opening Event’ took place on the 20th of May. Here we introduced our topic to the advisors and potential sponsors.
April
On the 21st of April, we shared our topic with the advisors. We started organising  ourselves, by  dividing the team in subteams.
March
"March is a month of considerable frustration - it is so near spring and yet across a great deal of the country the weather is still so violent and changeable that outdoor activity in our yards seems light years away." -  Thalassa Cruso  We chose three topics to work in detail from the list of several topics and we are grateful to our advisors who helped us in making our choice.The final topic was chosen on the 31st of March and all our excitements converged to that one idea.
February
"Every gardener knows that under the cloak of winter lies a miracle ... a seed waiting to sprout, a bulb opening to the light, a bud straining to unfurl.  And the anticipation nurtures our dream." -  Barbara Winkler Unleashing the bundled enthusiasm on our first brainstorming session on the 11th of February, to generate ideas for the project. Eventually we chose eight out of the seventeen proposed ideas to work further on.
January
‘Exams, Exams, Exams’. Not much involvement but we had a nice iGEM team and a summer project to look forward too.
December
The candidates’ interviews took place on the 10th and 11th of December and our ‘lucky 13’ team was formed. The first get together meeting was organized on the 19th of December.
November
The ex-iGEM’mers and the previous advisors organised at the 4th, 5th, 13th and 20th of November information sessions in different faculties. Candidates could apply till the 23rd of November by sending a CV and motivation letter.
October
The search for the team has started, ex-iGEM’mers introduced the iGEM competition by a movie in auditoria.
iGEM Competition
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course at MIT during their Independent Activities Period (IAP). The students designed biological systems to make cells blink. This design course grew to a summer competition with 5 teams in 2004, 13 teams in 2005 - the first year that the competition grew internationally - 32 teams in 2006, 54 teams in 2007, 84 teams in 2008, 112 teams in 2009, 130 teams in 2010, and 165 teams in 2011. Projects range from a rainbow of pigmented bacteria, to banana and wintergreen smelling bacteria, an arsenic biosensor, Bactoblood, and buoyant bacteria.
