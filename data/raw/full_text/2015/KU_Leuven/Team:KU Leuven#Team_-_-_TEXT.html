Team
Our team consists of 13 students who have dedicated their summer to work on the iGEM project. The numerous late night meetings organised from the beginning of the year 2015 were the perfect opportunity to create an optimal atmosphere to discuss the possible iGEM projects and to boost the team spirit. The team consists of students from 5 different faculties with different backgrounds, perspectives, nationalities, and languages. The diversity of the team gives us the strength and widens our horizons. We are all bound by our enthusiasm for science and research, and each of us possesses the courage to face big challenges. Additionally, we are supported by previous iGEMâ€™mers and employees from various levels of the KU Leuven University. The previous KU Leuven teams have set high standards to benchmark ourselves against. We will do our best to carry on this trend in the 2015 iGEM competition!

First on the screen, now in real life
Astrid does many things, she started as a bookworm who shaped our plasmid, worked in the lab, made plans for the symposium and visited schools to explain children about synthetic biology.
Eline started working on gaining sponsors for our project. Then she made the collaboration with Toulouse possible by creating a diffusion model in COMSOL. In the end she helped with the wiki.
Frederik's background in economics made him the perfect guy to acquire sponsors for our project. He created the survey. He explored several applications and wrote an economical report about it.
Ines discovered the world of social media to inform people about our project. When she isn't updating the public she can be found in the lab or behind her books.
Jasper is the brains behind our internal model. Apart from modeling he found time to invent, create and adjust our card game.
Laetitia delegated the lab work, planned frequent meetings, wrote new protocols and filled in our lab safety form. Additionally she provided general texts for the wiki.
Convincing people and companies to invest in our project became Laura's personal challenge, this included making the sponsor brochure and folder. Beside you can also find her in the lab.
Laurens started as our personal Photoshop hero who somehow still found time to 'GO TO THE LAB'. So he became our part-time Photoshop hero and part-time lab buddy.
With her background in web design, Leen was the ideal member to create our wiki. The whole summer she spent time on creating new pages, fixing mistakes and expanding our wiki.
Moritz was the first of our model team to finish his colony level model. He also contributed PDE-solvers and helped getting the wiki ready in time, the Outreach section in particular.
Ovia had the difficult task to ensure communication within the team. When she isn't working in the lab she provides us with beautiful images for the stickers and our wiki.
Thomas is our hybrid model specialist. He was the connection between lab and modeling so all the necessary information was passed trough.
In the beginning Vincent was the designated bookworm who browsed trough literature at full speed. When enough information was gathered he used this knowledge in the lab.
