-Writing and constructing wiki pages. -Our sweaters and T-shirts arrived!
hide
-Cloning our biobricks by use of the plasmid backbone originating from the InterLab Measurement Study. As a result,the biobricks CheZ-GFP, LuxI-His, LuxR-E and Ag43-YFP were obtained!
-Assembling the biobrick CheZ-GFP behind a strong promoter and RBS in order to characterize this biobrick.
-Assembling a strong promoter with GFP in order to compare the fluorescence to our library of promoters generated during the InterLab Measurement Study. Unfortunately the strong promoter was not green which indicates that the ligation did not work.
-Performing the OHHL quantification method and the leucine quantification method.

Week 11: the 7th-11th of September
hide
- On Monday, we had our ‘iGEM Symposium Day on Synthetic Biology, Cell Systems and Ethics in Biochemistry’
hide
- Constructing the BioBricks LuxI-His, RBS-LuxI-His and CheZ-GFP, RBS-CheZ-GFP by high fidelity tail-PCR, digestion and ligation in pSB1C3
- Transforming these BioBricks in E. cloni, testing colonies by PCR and preparing for sequencing. The high fidelity PCR and cloning of other potential BioBricks was repeated.
- Making our strains ΔtarΔtsr and ΔtarΔcheZ electrocompetent
- Checking our colonies containing the assembled gBlocks by restriction mapping showed the presence of the original pUC19 vector in our samples. Treating the assembled gBlocks with DpnI should circumvent this since DpnI only cuts the methylated DNA.
- Digesting with DpnI eliminated the original pUC19 and not a single colony grew on the control plate transformed with plasmid only. Analysing the positive colonies showed presence of pUC19.

- Miniprepping and analyzing the assembled gBlocks is showing the assembled plasmid, but also the presence of pUC19 used as template. Transformation of the gel-purified correct plasmid was done in E. Cloni
- In parallel, assembling LuxI with gBlocks 1+2+3 and gBlocks 5+6 with gBlocks 1+2+3 was conducted with colonies that did not contain any pUC. Analysis of the gel was not showing any sign of digestion.
