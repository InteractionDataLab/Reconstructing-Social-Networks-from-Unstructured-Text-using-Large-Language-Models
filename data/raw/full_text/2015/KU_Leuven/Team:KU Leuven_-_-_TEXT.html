Our Project
Patterns are fascinating, from the veins of a leaf to the stripes of a zebra. They are everywhere in nature, but why and how they are formed is not entirely understood. The way cells of multicellular organisms interact to generate a specific pattern has triggered our curiosity. We, the KU Leuven 2015 iGEM team, engaged in a project on the regulatory mechanisms of motif formation. Our mission is to engineer bacteria able to communicate and influence each other’s behaviour resulting in the assembly of predictable visible patterns.
We designed a system in which two different E. coli cell types A and B, when mixed on an agar plate, organize themselves in a complex pattern. The regulatory circuit controls and steers two bacterial properties: cell-cell interaction and motility. This circuit makes bacterial cells of type A to produce an adherent protein and at the same time repel B-type cells. We expect the development of a pattern, where A-cells are clumping together and B-cells form circles around A-cells. This synthetic bacterial system will provide us with a platform to study the fundamentals of pattern formation. Such synthetic circuits will be useful, e.g., for engineering complex tissues consisting of different cell types.
A big part of our project is its three layer structure modeling. The colony level considers the bacteria a large group of cells, described by partial differential equations. On the other hand, the internal level describes the interactions within the single cells. Finally, our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell interactions of our pattern forming cells. Those models give us even more potential to explain, plan and explore the fascinating, fundamental research of patterns.
A last message of the team
We are back from the Jamboree!!!
We were very eager to present our hard work to the jury and we received positive feedback:
First of all, we won a gold medal!!!
And we were nominated for 4 prizes in the Overgrad section: Best Poster, Best Education and Public Engagement, Best Model, and Best New Application Project, for which we were the runner-up! On top of that, we received the Interlab Study Award!
We are very happy with these results and we want to thank everybody who helped us achieve this! Thank you very much for giving us the summer of a lifetime!!!
To view all our achievements press the medal!
Wiki Game
Browsing through iGEM team wiki’s can be a time consuming job. To make this easier and fun we invented a wiki game to help you discover the nook and corner of our wiki. It allows you to get a simple overview of our wiki. Play our wiki game!

Research
Swift and smart in constructing our gene interaction scheme, plasmids and protein quantification methods. All of this to obtain and understand pattern formation.
Interlab
We decided to contribute to the worldwide fluorescence database. Click here to find more information about the InterLab Study.
Modeling
The modeling team will fit models to the data obtained by the wet lab. Continuous and hybrid models will be used. Hybrid models are models which have a discrete and continuous part.
Outreach
We informed students, other iGEM teams and the Belgian public more about synthetic biology and our project.
Future
Does Spot E.Shape only impact the academic environment, or is it likely to be picked up by industry? Click here to find out more about its future potential and applications.
Team
Diverse with respect to thoughts, perspectives, nationalities and languages, yet bound together by our enthusiasm for science and research. Would you like to know more about us?
Notebook
Many small steps need to be taken to achieve our goal. We like to keep you informed and welcome you to discover our newsfeed and history.

Modeling
The modeling team fits models to the data obtained by the wet lab. Synergically, simulations from the cyber lab will aid tuning the experimental conditions that lead to the desirable patterns.
