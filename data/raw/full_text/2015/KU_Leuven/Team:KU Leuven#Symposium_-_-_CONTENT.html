                Event summary
            </H2><P>
                On September the 7th, 2015 we organized the <B>KU Leuven iGEM 2015 Symposium on Synthetic Biology, Cell Systems and Ethics in Biochemistry</B>. Hosted guests included 4 neighbouring iGEM teams, academic staff, students, sponsors, and iGEM supporters from 6 different European countries. During this full-day event, the participants had a chance to attend the lectures by home speakers as well as by invited international keynote speakers from both the academia and the industry. The iGEM teams presented their research, and probably the most awaited part - the debate on ethics in biochemistry with panel of well selected experts lead by an experienced professional moderator - took place in the afternoon. To fulfil all the needs, goodie-bags, drinks, lunch, and dinner were provided to our guests. The day finished with a sightseeing walk around Leuven centre. Participation was free of charge. We hosted almost a hundred guests and received a very positive feedback. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="quote"><H2>

                    &quot;Food was very good!&quot; 
                    &quot;It was the best symposium I have ever attended!!! Outstanding organization!!!&quot; 
                    &quot;Very good symposium. The keynote speakers were marvellous, the debate was interesting, with panel members who were very well selected!&quot; </P></DIV></DIV><P>
                Home speaker <B>Vera van Noort</B> talked about lessons from systems biology of a
                minimal organism for synthetic biology. In the EMBL, where she worked, they
                wanted to completely describe one organism, namely <I>Mycoplasma
                pneumoniae</I>. For complete understanding, three different levels were studied: 
                The metabolism, transcription (regulation) and protein complexes. The take-home
                messages for synthetic biology in short: transcription regulation is more than
                operons and transcription factors; enzymes can catalyse multiple reactions and
                are organized in multi-subunit complexes; proteins can be part of multiple
                complexes and can be regulated by post-translational modifications and small
                peptides are essential. <B>Victor Dillard</B>, the first keynote speaker, is the
                founder of Desktop Genetics. The company is building software for biologists,
                with a focus on synthetic biology. The software helps to improve the efficiency
                and to lower the costs. He explained that genome editing remains hard and became
                a design and software challenge, and not purely biological challenge. This is
                because genome editing needs to be accurate, precise, effective and rapid.<B>Sebastian Maerkl</B>, the second keynote speaker, discussed the topic cell-free
                synthetic biology. He explained that microfluidics with cell-free lysate can be
                used for rapid prototyping of biological systems. One of the advantages is that
                it has defined and controllable reaction conditions. <I>In vitro</I> prototyping is
                used to speed up research in synthetic biology. The pipeline of cell-free
                synthetic biology: design a biological circuit, build the circuit, test parts
                and circuits, characterize working circuits, clone and implement <I>in vivo</I>.
                The second home speaker, <B>Yves Peeters</B>, gave a talk about directed evolution of
                polymerases using synthetic biology methods. The research of Yves Peeters is
                part of the research domain Xenobiology, creating alternative life, one of the
                approaches of synthetic biology. XNA, also called orthogonal DNA, is designed by
                several labs using different strategies. Making organisms with XNA will be an
                ultimate biosafety tool for synthetic biology. Before being able to have a
                liveable organism that uses XNA, there is a need for polymerases recognizing the
                specific XNA. To create the wanted polymerases, Yves uses directed evolution,
                including mutagenesis, screening, amplification and iteration of the most active
                enzymes.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV id="image1"><H4> Photo of the

                Sebastian Maerkl's lab conducts research at the interface of engineering and
                biology and is active in the areas of systems biology, synthetic biology and
                molecular diagnostics. They are driven by the desire to learn how to rationally
                design and engineer biological systems. Sebastian Maerkl’s research aims to
                develop new microfluidic technologies and apply them to solve biological
                problems. His rare expertise allows him to combine the design of new tools with
                advanced research in biology. Sebastian Maerkl is internationally recognized for
                his many outstanding contributions. Particularly in combining synthetic biology
                and computational systems with microfluidics, he demonstrated that the
                expression of genes in vivo can be provided based on the binding energy profiles
                in vitro. His studies will focus on five areas: the bioengineering of
                biosystems, the engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks, the
                engineering of genes and genomes, the engineering of biological systems de novo
                and the development of a new generation of diagnostic devices.

                The research group led by Vera van Noort is interested in understanding
                biological systems as a whole. They try to achieve this through computational
                analysis of large-scale data generated by the ever growing number of new
                technologies that can systematically measure the behaviour of multiple cellular
                components, such as biochemical activities, biophysical properties, subcellular
                localization and interaction. They use and develop new methods to integrate,
                visualize and query the large amounts of information available and in such a way
                come to new biological discoveries. A particular focus of the group is
                proteomics and post-translational modifications.
