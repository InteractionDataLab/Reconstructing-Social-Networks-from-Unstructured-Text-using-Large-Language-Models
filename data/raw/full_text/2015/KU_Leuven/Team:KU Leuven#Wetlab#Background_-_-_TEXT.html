Temperature sensitive cI_857= Mutated variant of the phage lambda repressor protein. It can bind firmly to the lambda promotor and represses transcription at low temperatures, but is unstable at elevated temperatures. LuxI =  enzyme for production an AHL called oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone. This highly diffusible molecule is used as a communication molecule between cells, and is able to bind with LuxR at the lux promotor to initiate transcription. LuxR = cytoplasmic receptor for AHL Ag43 = membrane protein, causes autoaggregation of cells IlvE = last enzyme in the biosynthesis of leucine. In order for it to work, we need to provide the right substrate:4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate to the medium. Leucine = amino acid, but also a repellent if tar is knocked out GFP = green fluorescent protein YFP = yellow fluorescent protein RFP  = red fluorescent protein PenI = Repressor protein, binds to the PenI regulated promotor LVA = degradation tag, signals the linked protein for intracellular degradation His-tag: repeat of six histidines, in order to purify it with nickelbeads E-tag: links the tagged protein  with an anti-E antibody
