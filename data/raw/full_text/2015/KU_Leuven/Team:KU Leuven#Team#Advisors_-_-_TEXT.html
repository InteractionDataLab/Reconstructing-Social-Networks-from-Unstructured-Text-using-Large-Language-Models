Mentors and Advisors
Johan Robben
Promoter
Professor, Faculty of Science at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
From the very beginning of our project, Johan has been ready to give advice when problems arose. He provided us with work space in the lab and is always willing to share his scientific expertise with us.
Katarzyna Malczewska
Supervisor

We couldnâ€™t imagine a better supervisor! Be it a scientific question or a silly doubt, an advice or some administration, a hot cup of coffee or just handy tips, she always knows what to do.
Oscar Torres
Advisor
Drs at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Oscar is our knock-out specialist. He helped us with the P1 phage transduction and demonstrated how to confirm our double knock-out. We can always ask him questions during our experiments.
Yves Peeters
Advisor
Drs at the  laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Yves is always willing to provide us with his crystal violet and electrocompetent cells. Above all he is interested in our project and likes to share advice.
Iris Govaerts
Advisor
Technician at the laboratory of Biochemistry, Molecular and Structural Biology Section
Iris is always there to help us order products, search for sponsors, give safety advice and help in the lab. She will provide us with handy hints wrapped up in funny stories.
Veerle De Wever
Advisor
Postdoctoral researcher at Laboratorium voor Biosignalering & Therapeutica
Veerle helped us choose the right topic. Besides, she guided the previous KU Leuven iGEM team and is happy to pass on her experience by giving practical advice on how to prepare for the Giant Jamboree.
Others
Advisors
We would like to extend our gratitude to all our advisors who have been very helpful during various stages of our project. We thank the ex-iGEMmers, the PhD students, professors and laboratory assistants, who participated in our pizza meetings and opening event, for giving their opinion. A special thank to our friends and significant others for their support and help during the opening event.
Sponsors
We also like to thank our sponsors, without their help an iGEM project could never succeed.
