                An economic rationale analysis for investing in the use of micro-organisms for
                the production of artificial bone implants
            </H2><P>
                Because our research contributes to the base of fundamental knowledge, it could
                be used as preliminary research for many applications. A brief look into the
                future potential, from an economic perspective, could possibly offer the
                rationale for a deeper research into the application. As we will see, there are
                many opportunities and challenges that pop up and need to be addressed, even in
                this early stage of the project. The main goal of this potential analysis is to construct a
                bridge between the pure scientific research and the commercial environment,
                resulting in a marketable product. In this analysis, we mainly focus on the use
                of Spot E.Shape principles to discover novel ways of producing artificial bone
                replacements . A similar analysis can be made for each of the other
                applications of the project. For more details on the other applications, please go to the

                        Nowadays, elderly people are more active than ever before. They cycle, play
                        tennis, go swimming, travel, etc. Besides, they do not want to give up on those
                        activities because of their age. Nevertheless, the risk of accidents with
                        possibly serious health consequences and broken limbs grows with age.
                        Approximately 1% of all falls of elderly people result in a hip fracture with an
                        acute mortality of 3%-5%. <SUP><A href="#Christmas2011">(2)</A></SUP></P></DIV></DIV><P>
                The ageing population and active life-style trends are two major driving forces
                for the demand of orthopaedic devices. Apart from that, the medical world is
                confronted with an increasing number of obesity and osteoporosis patients. These
                factors result in an enhanced growth of the orthopaedic industry. Medical device
                companies respond by continuously looking for new ways of treating fractured
                bones in order to reduce the curing time and to obtain a more performant device.
            </P><P>
                A closer look into the industry dynamics reveals that the industry is highly
                regulated and very dynamic where most of the industry players are
                well-established small and medium-size enterprises (SME’s). A start-up company
                often needs a significant better product to gain some market share in the
                medical device industry. Many of them choose to first enter a niche market to
                establish some early market share. Once they obtained a solid position in the
                industry, they can broaden their horizon by reaching out to new, unexplored
                markets.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="part"><H2>
                Relevance of using traditional materials for bone implants
            </H2><P>
                Traditionally orthopaedic devices have titanium alloys as the dominant material
                used in most artificial bone implants. However alternatives with new and better
                functions, lower failure rates and less resource demanding are finding their way to the industry. One
                of the most promising examples is tissue engineering where the cells from a
                patient or a donor are isolated. Thereafter, they are combined with
                biomaterials, grown in laboratories and then implanted into the patient. This approach is becoming more and more               a reality due to technological advancements. However there are some major concerns and drawbacks that prevent this technology to  really break through in the market for medical devices. The limited viable window from the point of extraction
                of cells to the reintroduction makes this technology less flexible.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(9)</A></SUP> 
                The transportation of these cells to and from the laboratory is also a huge
                challenge. Besides, the storage of tissue engineered products (TEP) at a
                constant temperature of -32°C puts pressure on the cost-efficiency.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(9)</A></SUP> 
                On top of that, TEP's in Europe suffered a lot under the 
                the lack of regulation. They are beyond the medical device regulation and the
                pharmaceutical regulation.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(9)</A></SUP> This ambiguity concerning the regulation               in Europe leads to a strong delay in market introduction. At the moment there is no
                dominant supply model based on mass production due to capacity limitations. This
                prevents TEP’s from really breaking through and becoming the industrially
                standard technology.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(9)</A></SUP></P><P>
                In the last decade, composite materials, polymers and ceramics steadily found
                their way to the medical device industry. This is mainly due to the lower
                failures rates, recalls and weight. Most materials also suffer from substantial wear effects.The particles that come loose during the process could possibly have a negative effect on the human health.   
The trend to use more eco-friendly and less scarce materials which are produced in a sustainable way is pushing the need for new materials. With our Spot E.Shape project,
                we would like to take this to the next level by imitating the natural bone
                structure as much as possible through the use of micro-organisms. 
            </P></DIV><DIV class="part"><H2>
                The positive consequences of using micro-organisms for bone engineering
            </H2><P>
                Spot E.Shape can be used for the construction of a wide range of bone prosthesis. Here we focus on
                hip prosthesis. These are of particular interest because they still result in a high acute mortality rate and the risk of complications serious shortens the life expectancy of the patient. Thus it is useful to look for new ways to produce hip implants.
            </P><P>
                Recently, surgeons are using a 3D printed implants made of titanium, polymers or
                ceramics for hip transplantations. Here the patient’s CT scan is used to design
                an exact replica of the femoral head. Our project could optimize this design by
                using bacteria that form and precipitate calcium phosphate in a controlled way.
                From there a porous, spongy structure similar to the bone can be formed. It's possible that these bacteria have to be supported by some structure (e.g. titanium frame) to receive the necessary characteristics for the hip implant. 
                Thereafter, this technique can also be used as a surface coating for the titanium alloy, so that the wear effects will be far less.
            </P><P>
                In order to identify and deal with the competitive implications of the so called
                salient attributes, we used the ACE Matrix (Attribute Categorization and
                Evaluation) by Ian C. MacMillan and Rita Gunther McGrath <SUP><A href="#MacMillan1996">(7)</A></SUP> applied to our
                orthopaedic device. The columns refer to the level of energy the attribute
                generate for the customer while the rows refer to the sentiment it provokes.
                <SUP><A href="#MacMillan1996">(7)</A></SUP>  This analytic tool serves to identify the right mix and dynamic fit between
                the customer needs and the attributes of the product.<SUP><A href="#MacMillan1996">(7)</A></SUP>  Particularly
                interesting are the powerful energizers that often become the determining factor
                for the purchase decision. The layer of calcium deposited by the bacteria can be
                seen as a coating for the titanium structure which reduces substantially the
                amount of constraint and wear of the prosthesis (Energizer). Wear is something that more
                traditional metallic and polyethylene prosthesis have to deal with. Other reasons why customers would be willing to buy our product (compared to the competitor's one), are its eco-friendliness and low material cost (possibly lower price).

                    </H4></DIV></DIV><P>
                An important issue is that dissatisfiers can encourage the customers (mostly
                surgeons) to opt for a competitor which reduces customer loyalty.<SUP><A href="#MacMillan1996">(7)</A></SUP>  In the
                case of our medical device, it is crucial to conduct long-term experiments to
                test possible health effects. The process of bacteria removal could also evoke serious customer concerns which could lead customers to choose for a competitor. An effective method in combination with lots of customer information campaigns are two ways to deal with this dissatisfier. Additionally already in the prototyping phase, we
                need to start thinking about possible ways to automate and fasten the production
                process. This could reduce the price of the product and at the same time the wait-to-delivery time. 
                On the other hand, a competitor’s action can turn a
                tolerable into a dissatisfier, e.g. the competitor eliminates a negative
                characteristic. To be one step ahead of competition, we need to monitor continuously our product quality.
            </P><P>
                We have to remark that the validation phase concerning the customer perceptions
                of attributes still needs to be performed. Keep also in mind that this analysis
                is a foresight for a medical device application, which implies that at this
                stage, not every attribute can be proved scientifically.

                Barriers for the market introduction of orthopaedic materials based on
                micro-organisms
            </H2><P>
                Introducing a brand new technology often comes with some major challenges to
                overcome. In this section, we are focusing on the different potential issues
                that need to be addressed in further stages of the project. We identify three of
                them, namely the financial gap, regulation gap and human capital gap.
            </P><P><B>
                Financial gap
            </B>
                Orthopaedic research is often time-consuming and requires a substantial
                investment during the development, production and distribution phase before it
                can be translated into a final product for patient care.<SUP><A href="#Buckwalter2008At">(1)</A></SUP> During the current
                proof-of-concept phase of the project, we already experienced a clear need for
                financials. Radical innovations typically need large investments in further
                technological development before a first working prototype can be constructed
                and tested. <SUP><A href="#Jensen2001">(4)</A></SUP> From the perspective of potential investors, there is a lot of
                uncertainty about the outcome which will probably lead to a long payback time
                and thus few economic incentives to invest in this early stage of the project.
                <SUP><A href="#Shane2004">(12)</A></SUP> The phenomenon of investor reluctance is often described as ‘the financial
                barrier’ which plays a role on the level of private financiers, such as banks
                and venture capital firms.<SUP><A href="#Lockett2002">(6)</A></SUP> The need for government stimulants through
                specialised funding programs is clearly present.<SUP><A href="#Rasmussen2011">(10)</A></SUP> This is underlined by the
                fact that publicly funded venture capital firms are more willing to consider
                investing in early-stage university spin-outs than private ones.<SUP><A href="#Knockaert2010">(5)</A></SUP></P><P>
                Next is the pre-seed funding phase that further explores
                managerial and organisational aspects of the project in order to make it more
                attractive for potential investors.<SUP><A href="#Rasmussen2011">(10)</A></SUP> In the proof-of-concept phase,
                government funding mainly serves the role of reducing the technological
                uncertainty while the reduction of the organisational uncertainty is mainly the
                purpose of pre-seed funding. For this phase we are currently fully relying on
                sponsorship from the industry and university organisations. The option of applying for a governmental grant remains possible for further stages.
            </P><P>
                The third major phase or seed phase takes place when the company is established,
                but basically it does not generate enough cash flow to survive on its own. For
                their early investments, investors are often given an equity stake in return.
                Attracting venture capital investors remains difficult because they prefer to
                invest in university spin-outs after the seed phase, when the research and
                following application proved to be robust.<SUP><A href="#Wright2006">(14)</A></SUP> Possible investors should be
                found in the industry, angel investors, crowd funding, government, etc.
            </P><P>
                When a company grows, at some point in time there will be an immediate financial
                need that is too high to bear for traditional investors. Often regional and
                national venture capital firms are then the only option to turn at. However
                involving venture capital firms should be a well-considered decision. They bring along a
                new working culture, make demands (e.g. hiring professional managers and
                administrators) and put pressure on the firm to get the necessary in-house
                competences. All of this is done with respect to the return-on-investment they
                need so desperately regarding their 10-year horizon.<SUP><A href="#Styhre2014">(13)</A></SUP> 
                This could lead to tremendous progress for the company or they can break up with the
                company in the long term if they don't receive a high enough return-on-investment.<SUP><A href="#Styhre2014">(13)</A></SUP></P><P><B>
                Regulation gap
            </B>

                A lack of regulation can be considered as double-edged, where it shortens the
                product innovation cycle but at the same time makes marketing your product more
                complicated. Orthopaedic devices are normally classified as a medical device
                and fall within the European medical device regulation. To be issued with a CE
                mark, medical devices must achieve high quality, safety and performance
                standards.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(9)</A></SUP> However the specificity of our device, which is based on the
                precipitation by bacteria, could possibly be subject to the regulation of
                genetically modified organisms. The narrow legal framework concerning GMO's in
                Europe could affect and delay the innovation process of our orthopaedic device.
                The ambiguity and lack of clarity to which regulation our application can be
                applied, shows the need for the realignment of regulation with practice and
                current state-of-technology.<SUP><A href="#Freeman1988">(3)</A></SUP></P><P><B>
                Human capital gap
            </B>

                Knockaert et al. suggested that “One of the principal challenges facing
                university spin-outs is academic entrepreneurs tending to possess little
                commercial human capital.”<SUP><A href="#Knockaert2010">(5)</A></SUP> The fact that they are experts in their domain
                does not make them the perfect marketers for their product. As showed above, the
                orthopaedic industry is characterised by a certain set of aspects. Appropriate
                managers will more likely find more adapted ways of dealing with these
                differences. Besides there are possible conflicts of interest with the
                traditional roles of research and teaching that might pop up when academic
                entrepreneurs need to run a business.<SUP><A href="#Rasmussen2011">(10)</A></SUP> Raising venture capital should also
                be done by an entrepreneur who possesses lots of commercial human capital. This
                shows clearly that the different challenges are interrelated.<SUP><A href="#Knockaert2010">(5)</A></SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="part"><H2>
                Desired approach for the market introduction
            </H2><P>
                The orthopaedic device industry is currently confronted with a rising demand for
                new orthopaedic hip prosthesis. To deal with this, we came up with a brand
                new device based on the use of bacteria. However we described three major
                barriers that can potentially disturb the realization of its economic potential.
                The purpose of this section is not to provide an exhaustive description of a
                go-to-market-strategy or business plan, but rather briefly offering some
                guidelines that need to be kept in mind to secure a bright future perspective.
            </P><P>
                Parallel to tissue engineered products, where they also work with cells<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(10)</A></SUP>, the
                end product is highly customized and falls under the ‘Make to Order’ approach.
                In view of the high demand of orthopaedic products, this will not be sufficient
                to establish a competitive supply model that is capable of gathering a
                significant part of the market. The way to deal with this obstacle should be to
                identify all the parts that can be automated and scaled-up already in an early
                stage of the development process in order to satisfy a mass market.<SUP><A href="#Phillips2011">(10)</A></SUP>
                In order to commercialize the device, there should also be thought off patenting
                the invention. The Bayh–Dole-inspired legislation made this possible for
                universities and was adopted by many countries in their national regulation.

                There comes a time when you can not do everything on your own anymore,
                especially in an industry where multiple disciplines overlap and different
                competences are needed. The interdisciplinary aspect is one way
                to explain the search for the right strategic partner to forge an alliance with.
                The reduction of technological uncertainty in the early phases of a project
                could be a second reason for collaboration with a partner from industry. <SUP><A href="#Pangarkar2003">(10)</A></SUP>
                This will make the search for potential investors a lot easier and reduce the
                time-to-market for the application. This is also often the phase where a
                university spin-off is created, which acts like an independent business.

                Anecdotal evidence states that it is very hard to become profitable as a company
                from the start. However the goal of taking market share by aiming at a niche market is
                a much more realistic objective than reaching a positive cash flow. Once this is
                obtained, the company will be considered as an interesting investment for the
                big medical device companies which will be eager to take over the company.
                However if the ultimate goal of market share is not reached, the company will
                not generate a breakthrough and succumb rapidly.<SUP><A href="#Styhre2014">(13)</A></SUP></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="summaryheader"><DIV class="summaryimg"><DIV class="head"><H2> References </H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="reference"><DIV class="part"><TABLE><TBODY><TR valign="top"><TD align="right" class="bibtexnumber">
