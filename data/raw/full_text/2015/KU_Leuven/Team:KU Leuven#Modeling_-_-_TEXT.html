Modeling
The fascinating properties of pattern creating bacteria can be translated into                         the language of mathematics. In this subsection we investigate the                         equations behind the behavior of the genetically modified organisms created in                         the wetlab. For this purpose, a layered approach seems appropriate. Colony level modeling employs                         partial differential equations to describe large cell groups which are treated                         as a continuum. Internal level models describe the interactions that happen                         within single cells. Finally the hybrid model merges the two approaches into a                         final description of our pattern forming cells.
Colony
Our colony layer model relies on a Keller-Segel type system of partial differential                                         equations. These equations are simulated using finite differences.
Hybrid
The hybrid model represents an intermediate level of detail in between the colony level model and the internal model. Bacteria are treated as individual agents, while chemical species are modeled using partial differential equations.
Internal
Our internal model aims to simulate the internal dynamics of every cell with a system of ordinary differential equations.
FBA (Toulouse)
As a part of our modeling cooperation we exchanged models with the Toulouse                                         team. This is the flux balance analysis they performed for us.

Hybrid
Our hybrid model merges both colony and internal level to define the cell-cell                                     interactions of our pattern forming cells.
