Creating an iGEM project requires hard work in many fields. Obviously, research in literature, simulations executed by the modeling team and practical work in the wet lab are necessary. We also want to pass our knowledge to future generations and iGEM teams. Therefore we develop a wiki, communicate our project in the media and teach primary school students more about our project and synthetic biology in general. Above all, organized an ethical debate because by discussion, you get a deeper insight in different opinions. To realize all this in a structured manner, close interaction between all team members and subteams is mandatory. To keep you up to date, check our newsfeed and history.
