Perception of synthetic biology
Introduction
Can synthetic biology have a positive influence on the environment? Can DNA be                 patented? What kind of applications are socially acceptable? These are the kind                 of questions which often characterize a social debate. The social debate about                 synthetic biology is in a much further stage in the USA than in Europe [5] . On top of that, there are numerous important social organisations and                 public groups who didn’t formulate a clear opinion about synthetic biology [5] . This implicates that the current debate didn’t evolve in a particular                 direction which makes it even more interesting to carry out a survey on the                 current perception of synthetic biology. This survey was conducted among Belgian                 citizens, older than 18 (focus group) and led to 352 responses.  Download the pdf-survey files in Dutch , French , English or German . In the sample,                 only 2 out of 10 respondents say that they know what synthetic biology stands                 for while 4 in 10 only heard of it. The other respondents have no clue about the                 meaning of synthetic biology. Considering the people who have some sense of what                 synthetic biology means, 46% associate synthetic biology with genetical                 engineering and modification. 32% of the respondents see it as something                 artificial and unnatural. 25% characterise synthetic biology by its applications                 where health care is mentioned in 44% of the cases while agriculture counts for                 24%. A short collection of associations with synthetic biology from the                 respondents can be found in Figure 1

A remarkable fact is that respondents who are not professionally involved in                 synthetic biology, often cite elements of synthetic biology, but they are unable                 to give a comprehensive and clear description. Moreover, there are numerous                 fallacies about synthetic biology which can influence the opinion                 of the general public dramatically. Synthetic biologists often counter the hesitant and                 sometimes negative attitude of individuals with the existence of an information                 gap. This vision is supported by the research of McHughen, indicating the                 fact that people do not possess the necessary knowledge and information to                 formulate a relevant opinion on biotechnology [3] . But does supplementary information lead to a change in the acceptance                 rate of synthetic biology? After asking the respondents about their opinion on                 synthetic biology, they were given a well-balanced description of synthetic                 biology, including opportunities and threats. There is strong evidence that the                 acceptance level of synthetic biology is significantly different when the                 respondents are given a definition of synthetic biology. Figure 2 clearly                 shows an increase of 13.5% in the approval rate of synthetic biology which is                 mainly due to the decrease in neutral answers. The decrease in the number of                 neutral answers is most likely due to the fact that informed people make up                 their mind more easily.

Not “just” an application
A common saying about synthetic biology is that it paves the way for the             development of a whole range of novel industrial applications in health care,             biofuels, crop management, etc. However not every application can be valued in             the same way. Previous research [1] [2] showed that the perceived usefulness of knowledge for the individual is crucial             in his grasps of science and technology. This clearly shows the importance of             the direct benefits of biotechnological applications to the individual [4] . This survey analyses how people evaluate various applications of             synthetic biology. Although the use of synthetic biology in the human body often             comes with ethical concerns, we see that 70% of the respondents have no problem             with the use of synthetic biology to produce medicines, in this case insulin.             The same can be said about biofuels as an alternative energy source, where             nearly 50% evaluate it as very positive. The results about the environmental             technology (reduction of pollutants) and agricultural applications (modified             crops) show less transparent results, but there seems to be a tendency to             consider it as a positive development.
Respondents defining synthetic biology
"I think of producing biological tissues and cells to replace natural and                 depleted resources."
"Synthetic biology sounds related to GMO’s where organisms are genetically                 manipulated."
"Tweaking the building blocks of life."
"It sounds like normal biology, but with adjustments made by human involvement."
"I see it as growing things from nothing."
"Fine-tuning organisms to combat diseases more efficiently."
"Artificially producing organs and human body parts."
"Synthetic biology makes me think of producing biological components in order to                 mimic and improve biological phenomena, for example tissue regeneration."
"Cloning and genetically engineering come to my mind, things that are                 lab-grown."
Ethical concerns
Synthetic biology often brings along ethical and social issues. At the KU             Leuven iGEM symposium, a panel of experts in synthetic biology gave already             their opinion about some ethical and moral questions. But this does not             necessarily match with the opinion of the general public. Over 70% of the             respondents see the potential of synthetic biology for the human well-being and             environment. It is also clear that the patent debate is far from over. There is             no public consensus about the desirability of patents in synthetic biology, but             there is a slight tendency towards disapproval.

Even though synthetic biology is a promising field, that doesn’t mean that it         is everywhere a “hot” topic. As the survey showed, almost 4 in 10 persons do not         have any idea of its meaning. People that are unfamiliar with synthetic biology         are often confronted with a lot of personal doubts and concerns. Each respondent         was therefore asked about the aspect of synthetic biology that he or she wants         to know more about. 28% of the respondents want to know more about the potential         risks that come with synthetic biology, especially how the spread and survival         of genetic modified organisms in nature can be controlled. Besides, 10% of the         respondents is concerned about the adequacy of the current regulations around         synthetic biology. 30% would like to know more about the applications and         possible benefits which can be obtained. A minor 5% would like to know more         about the scientific and technical aspects of synthetic biology. The doubts         people have concerning synthetic biology are often considered as a consequence         of the lack of knowledge and communication which is a popular statement between         scientists. But what kind of methods are considered as a good way of building         trust in the view of the respondent? 40% suggest to better communicate and         inform the general public on what synthetic biology stands for in general. 28%         specify that the benefits should be showed using applications. Many people         suggest to use applications that are close to the individual’s every day         environment where the possible disadvantages should not be neglected but rather         explained and investigated. 14% of the respondents remarked that more positive         publicity about synthetic biology is necessary to change the public perception.
There can be concluded that the work is far from done. A large number of people         do not know anything about synthetic biology while there are still many         fallacies circulating. Given this observation, we can not just sit back and         watch the situation from a distance. If we want to make a change, even though it         is probably a small one, then the only thing we can do is communicating and         informing people. Or as a respondent puts it: “Unknown equals unloved.”         Therefore we are visiting schools to educate and introduce children to the world         of science (see education section). On top of that, we created an educative game         and organised a symposium about synthetic biology (see symposium section),         complemented by an ethical debate between current leaders, academics as well as         entrepreneurs, in the field of synthetic biology.
