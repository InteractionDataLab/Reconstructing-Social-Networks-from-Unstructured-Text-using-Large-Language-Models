Transformation
		</DIV><DIV class="text" align="left"><OL><LI> Make sure that the incubator (30/37C) and heat block (42C) are ON.
</LI><LI> Put water in the wells of the 42°C heat block.</LI></OL><LI> Make sure required antibiotic plates are present.  Make sure you're using the right antibiotic plates for your plasmid's resistance!
</LI><LI> Warm plates to 37°C.  Cold plates reduce transformation efficiency by an order of magnitude.</LI><LI> Also warm 500 µl SOC per transformation to room temperature (if it was in the refrigerator.)</LI><LI> Take the DNA out of --20 freezer, let it thaw.
</LI><LI> Vortex DNA to mix, then spin down.  Make sure it is completely thawed out!</LI><LI> Make sure that all of the required reagents/DNA etc are present at the site of transformation before you take the cells out of the -80.</LI><LI> Thaw the competent cells on ice for 3-4 min.
</LI><LI> You want to add your DNA right as the last bit of cells' ice melts.  Even if it's still a little slushy, that's okay.</LI><LI> Add 1-2 µl of DNA into the comp cells.  Stir with a pipette tip a few times, then put right back on ice.
</LI><LI> If you're transforming the result of a reaction (GG, LR, etc) add 1-2 µl of the reaction.  Don't add more: many of these reactions have additives that screws up transformation.</LI><LI> If you're transforming plasmid DNA (from a miniprep), either (a) dilute it out so you add only ~10 ng of DNA, or (b) plate only 10 µl of the outgrowth – else you'll get a lawn!  Super-coiled DNA transforms super-efficiently.  As an alternative, transform 1 ul of miniprep DNA and then <I>streak</I> the outgrowth instead of plating with beads.</LI><LI> You can rescue DNA from an empty mini prep tube by gently pipetting the cells into the empty DNA tube, enough DNA will be stuck to the walls.</LI><LI> Incubate the cells on ice for 30-40 min.</LI><LI> Heat shock the cells for EXACTLY 30 sec at 42 C water bath.</LI><LI> Place back on ice for 90 seconds.</LI><LI> Add 250 ul of SOC (37° to RT) medium to each tube (S.O.C is made by dissolving 0.5 ml of 20% glucose in 25 ml of SOB. Make sure that the SOC is clear and not cloudy/ contaminated.)</LI><LI> Shake the tubes at 37 C, 280 rpm for 60 min.</LI><LI> Plate 100 µl for a reaction product, or 10 µl in a 100 µl puddle of water for a supercoiled plasmid.</LI><LI> Incubate plates upside down overnight at 37 C or 16-18h at 30C.Can leave the cells in the incubator for up to 18 hours but no more.</LI></DIV><DIV class="text"><A name="GelPrepRunExtract"> </A></DIV><DIV class="subtitle">

and other enzymatic reactions (see page 8). For cleanup of other enzymatic reactions,
follow the protocol as described for PCR samples or use the MinElute Reaction Cleanup
Kit. Fragments ranging from 100 bp to 10 kb are purified from primers, nucleotides, polymerases,
and salts using QIAquick spin columns in a microcentrifuge.
</P><H3>Important points before starting</H3><UL><LI>Add ethanol (96–100%) to Buffer PE before use (see bottle label for volume).</LI><LI>All centrifugation steps are carried out at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) in a
conventional tabletop microcentrifuge at room temperature.</LI><LI>Add 1:250 volume pH indicator I to Buffer PB (i.e., add 120 µl pH indicator I to
30 ml Buffer PB or add 600 µl pH indicator I to 150 ml Buffer PB). The yellow color
of Buffer PB with pH indicator I indicates a pH of ≤ 7.5.</LI><LI>Add pH indicator I to entire buffer contents. Do not add pH indicator I to buffer
aliquots.</LI><LI>If the purified PCR product is to be used in sensitive microarray applications, it may
be beneficial to use Buffer PB without the addition of pH indicator I.</LI></UL><H3>Procedure</H3><OL><LI><P><STRONG>Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix. It is not necessary
to remove mineral oil or kerosene.</STRONG></P><P>For example, add 500 µl of Buffer PB to 100 µl PCR sample (not including oil). </P></LI><LI><P><STRONG>If pH indicator I has beein added to Buffer PB, check that the color of the mixture is
yellow.</STRONG></P><P>If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH
5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.</P></LI><LI><STRONG> Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.</STRONG></LI><LI><STRONG> To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.</STRONG></LI><LI><P><STRONG> Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.</STRONG></P><P>Collection tubes are re-used to reduce plastic waste.</P></LI><LI><STRONG> To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.</STRONG></LI><LI><P><STRONG>Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min. </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless
the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.</P></LI><LI><STRONG>Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.</STRONG></LI><LI><P><STRONG>To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to
the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. Alternatively,
for increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick
membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>IMPORTANT:</STRONG> Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick
membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volume is 48 µl
from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl elution buffer. </P><P>Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. The maximum elution efficiency is achieved
between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this
range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering
agent. The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH
8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.</P></LI><LI><P><STRONG>If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to
5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before
loading the gel. </STRONG></P><P>Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and
orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization
of agarose gel run time. Refer to Table 2 (page 15) to identify the dyes according
to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.</P></LI></OL></DIV><DIV class="text"><A name="DesignAndOrderPrimers"> </A></DIV><DIV class="subtitle">

Some primers are standard, they normally read from the ends of the insert.  Check the backbone to see what sequencing primers are in place.  These may be available from the sequencing shop, or they should at least be in the fridge.</LI><LI> If your gene is less than whatever length you can sequence it using back bone primers and do not need to design your own</LI><LI> If your gene is larger then what can be read by the back bone primers, you will need to sequence part way through with custom primers.</LI><LI> Highlight a 50-100 bp region that you want the primer to bind in</LI><LI> Select &quot;Primers&quot; from the top banner and &quot;design new primers&quot; from the drop down tab</LI><LI> Set task to &quot;Generic&quot;</LI><LI> Check forward primer and DO NOT check reverse primer</LI><LI> Check &quot;Included Region&quot;</LI><LI> Set &quot;Tm Min&quot; to 50 optimal to 55 and &quot;Tm Max&quot; to 60</LI><LI> Set &quot;GC Min&quot; to 45 optimal to 50 and &quot;GC Max to 55</LI><LI> Set &quot;GC Clamp&quot; to 1</LI><LI> Hit OK and pick the best primer generated - hovering your mouse over the primer will give you Tm and GC content</LI></UL><P>General tips for sequencing:
</P><P>Reads are only clear about 30 bp after the primer to 600 bp after the primer.
</P><P>The easiest way to pick primers is to start with one in a 50 bp region in front of the gene and then measure out 500 bp from that primer then place the next one in the following 100 bp region then measure out 500 bp and place one in the next 100 bp region and so on.

NEB recommends a total of 0.02–0.5 pmols of DNA fragments when 1 or 2 fragments are being assembled into a vector and 0.2–1.0 pmoles of DNA fragments when 4–6 fragments are being assembled. Efficiency of assembly decreases as the number or length of fragments increases. To calculate the number of pmols of each fragment for optimal assembly, based on fragment length and weight, we recommend using NEB's online tool, <A href="/external-links/nebiocalculator">NEBioCalculator</A> , or using the following formula:
pmols = (weight in ng) x 1,000 / (base pairs x 650 daltons)
50 ng of 5000 bp dsDNA is about 0.015 pmols.
50 ng of 500 bp dsDNA is about 0.15 pmols.
The mass of each fragment can be measured using the NanoDrop instrument,
absorbance at 260 nm or estimated from agarose gel electrophoresis followed
by ethidium bromide staining.

</P><P>Crude oil of <EM>R. opacus</EM> PD630 was obtained from lyophilized cell material (15 g), which was stirred twice each with 500 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) at room temperature for 3 h. The solvents were evaporated from the combined extracts, and the residual material, 5·2 g, was dissolved in light petroleum (b.p. 30–40 °C) and applied to a column packed with 20 g silica gel 60 (mesh 50–200 μm, Merck) equilibrated with light petroleum. The column was eluted with 500 ml light petroleum; the total eluate was collected and evaporated to dryness to obtain 4·4 g of a yellowish crude oil fraction, which consisted of 90% fatty acids in total.
</P><P>To determine the identity of the lipids, TLC was carried out on silica gel 60 F<SUB>254</SUB> plates (0·2 mm, Merck). For this, samples of lyophilized cell material were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and light petroleum (b.p. 30–40 °C)/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1) was used as solvent. In some experiments, a double solvent system, benzene/acetic acid (85:15, v/v) followed by light petroleum (b.p. 30–40 °C) applied in the same direction, was used. Preparative TLC was carried out on silica gel plates of 2 mm thickness (Merck). Plates impregnated with methanolic silver nitrate or boric acid (each 5%, w/v) were also used. Lipid fractions were visualized by heating the plates over a Bunsen flame after spraying with 40% sulfuric acid. Components on preparative plates were visualized after brief exposure to iodine vapour. Quinone compounds were detected on silica gel TLC plates by specific staining with a leukomethylene blue spray reagent (Krebs <EM>et al.</EM>, 1967⇓ ). Quinones appeared immediately as dark blue spots on a faint blue background. Osmium tetroxide vapour was used to visualize unsaturated compounds. 2-Monopalmitoylglycerol, tripalmitoylglycerol, 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, 1,3-dipalmitoylglycerol, cetylpalmitate, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-myristoyl-<EM>rac</EM>-glycerol, hexadecanol, tetradecene and oleic acid obtained from Sigma were used as reference substances.
</P><P>Analysis of fatty acids.
</P><P>To determine the fatty acid content of the cells and the composition of the lipids, these compounds were treated to yield fatty acid methyl esters (Brandl <EM>et al.</EM>, 1988⇓ ; Timm <EM>et al.</EM>, 1990⇓ ), which were analysed by GC with a Perkin Elmer model 8420 gas chromatograph equipped with a Permaphase PEG 25Mx capillary column (25 m × 0·32 mm) and a flame ionization detector. A 2 μl portion of the organic phase was analysed after split injection (split ratio, 1:40); helium (32 ml min–1) was used as carrier gas. The temperatures of the injector and detector were 230 °C and 275 °C, respectively, and a temperature programme was used for the separation of methyl esters (120 °C for 5 min; temperature increase of 8 °C min−1; 180 °C for 37 min) on the column. The fatty acids were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of standard fatty acid methyl esters.
</P><P>Reversed-phase HPLC.
</P><P>Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on an RP-18 Merck LiChroSphere 100 column (5 μm, 250 × 4·6 mm i.d.) using a Kontron HPLC apparatus equipped with a series 522 chromatographic pump. Elution of the compounds was monitored at 210 nm using a Kontron DAD 540 diode array detector (DAD) or an Alltech ELSD 500 evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD) connected to a KromaSystem 2000 integrator system. The ELSD temperature was set to 55 °C. Acetonitrile/acetone (38:62, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 was used as solvent system. To characterize TAG mixtures further, a partition number (<EM>PN</EM>) variable was used: <EM>PN=CN</EM>−<EM>2ND</EM>, where <EM>CN</EM> and <EM>ND</EM> represent the total carbon number and the total number of double bonds in the fatty acids in the TAG molecule, respectively (Ruiz-Gutiérrez &amp; Barron, 1995⇓ ).&quot;

Folch Method
                </DIV><DIV class="text" align="left"><P>
The most popular extraction procedure is that of Folch (<I>Folch et al., J Biol Chem 1957, 226,
497</I>): </P><OL><LI><P>The tissue is homogenized with
chloroform/methanol (2/1) to a final volume 20 times the volume of the tissue sample (1 g
in 20 ml of solvent mixture). After dispersion, the whole mixture is agitated during
15-20 min in an orbital shaker at room temperature.</P></LI><LI><P>The homogenate is either filtrated (funnel with a folded filter paper) or centrifuged to
recover the liquid phase. </P></LI><LI><P> The solvent is washed with 0.2 volume (4 ml for 20 ml) of water
or better 0.9% NaCl solution. After vortexing some seconds, the mixture is centrifuged at
low speed (2000 rpm) to separate the two phases. Remove the upper phase by siphoning and
kept it to analyze gangliosides or small organic polar molecules. If necessary (need of
removing labelled molecules...), rinse the interface one or two times with methanol/water
(1/1) without mixing the whole preparation.</P></LI><LI><P> After centrifugation and siphoning of the
upper phase, the lower chloroform phase containing lipids is evaporated under vacuum in a
rotary evaporator or under a nitrogen stream if the volume is under 2-3 ml.</P></LI></OL><P align="center"> </P><P>COMMENTS :It must be emphasized that the method of tissue disruption affects 
  the concentrations of extracted lipids. Therefore, for poorly explored tissues, 
  the analyst must be careful in comparing various methods of tissue disruption. 
  
  As an example, it was demonstrated that better recoveries of liver lipids are 
  obtained extracting 150 mg of liver tissue with 30 second sonication (or a 2 
  min homogenization), followed by a 2h shaking in chloroform/methanol reagent 
  and a 12h incubation in chloroform. A drying time of 6h must be observed before 
  weighing to get reliable lipid amounts (<I>Ametaj BN et al. J Agric Food Chem 
  2003, 51, 2105</I>).
  The use of dichloromethane instead of chloroform has been evaluated in extracting 
  lipids from samples of different natures (<I>Cequiez-Sanchez E et al., J Agric 
  Food Chem 2008, 56, 4297</I>). The results indicate that dichloromethane/methanol 
  can replace the commonly employed chloroform/methanol, thus avoiding the major 
  health, security, and regulatory problems associated with the use of chloroform.
  It has been determined that the Folch method is most effective for the extraction 
  of a broad range of lipid classes in human lipoproteins (<I><A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23670529" target="_blank">Reis 
  A et al.</A>, J Lipid Res 2013, 54, 1824</I>). Furthremore, their results revealed 
  that while for major lipid classes there are negligible differences in the solvent 
  system chosen, the same is not true for minor lipid classes. </P></DIV><DIV class="text"><A name="TLCProtocol"> </A></DIV><DIV class="subtitle">

Pipette 0.5 ml out of each flask into 2 ml centrifuge tubes. When there is a lot of filter paper gunk, use the cut pipette tips. Do this twice for each flask. You should now have 18 tubes (labeled 1.1a, 1.1b, 2.1a, 2.1b, etc). Shake the flasks well immediately before pipetting and pipette up and down when drawing your sample. Immediately put the flasks back into the shaker.  
2. Use scissors and cut off the lids of the labeled 2ml centrifuge tubes. Save the lids. Take the mesh caps off the 5 mL Falcon polysterene round bottom tube with cell-strainer cap cytometer tubes and cap them on the lidless centrifuge tubes. Throw away capless cytometer tubes. Vortex the centrifuge tubes and then immediately pipette the 0.5ml of liquid through the mesh caps directly into the centrifuge tubes. Press tip of pipette pretty firmly down on the mesh and pipette up and down in quick short movements. The goal is to get all of the fluid on the inside of the tube, if any ends up on top of the mesh, especially in the form of bubbles, aspirate it up and try again. 
</P><P>3. When done pipetting, throw out mesh caps and re-cap the centrifuge tubes with the saved, cut-off lids.  
</P><P>4. Centrifuge with the 18-slot centrifuge 10 min at 8800 rpm. 
</P><P>5. Label two sets of 18 cryotubes each with numbers 1.1a-5.2b, 1 set with &quot;s&quot; for supernatant and 1 set with &quot;c&quot; for cells, the time (hour of day), and &quot;a&quot; or &quot;p&quot; for am or pm, and the day of the month for the 4 pm samples with your initials beneath. Label the lid the same way except without your initials.
