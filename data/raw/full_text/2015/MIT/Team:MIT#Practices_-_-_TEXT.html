Human Practices Overview
State of the Art in Consolidated Bioprocessing
We have researched the current state of the art in consolidated bioprocessing and the production of biofuels in order to best design our project for practical applications.
Economics and Environmental Impact
We have analyzed the economic advantage and environmental impact of our project.
Reaching Out to the Experts
We reached out to experts in the field of bioprocessing. We interviewed them and incorporated the information from those interviews into our project.
