Parameters for Growing at 30 C
Because we ran our Co-Culture Experiments at 30 C, we had to fit parameters for substrate and xylose uptake at 30 C, since only values at 37 C are reported in the literature
Biodiesel Model
We added reactions for biodiesel production to the iJO1366 whole-genome FBA model using COBRA functions. In order to produce positive fluxes through these non-native reactions, simulating constitutive expression, we used Proportional Flux Forcing (PFF) .
