Additionally, we would like to acknowledge Professor Kristala Jones Prather, Ben Woolston, and Jose Gomez for making time to give us feedback on specific aspects of the project.
We would like to thank the Monsanto Company and Ginkgo Bioworks for graciously allowing us to tour their facilities and giving us constructive criticism on our project. The Monsanto Company also helped sponsor our project.
We are grateful to the Keasling Lab at UC Berkeley for the A2A strain E. coli.
We were financially supported by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the MIT Department of Bioengineering, and the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
