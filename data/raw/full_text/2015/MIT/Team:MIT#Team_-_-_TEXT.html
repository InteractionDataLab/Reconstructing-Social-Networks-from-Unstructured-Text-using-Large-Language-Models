Alyssa Dayan
Alyssa is a freshman studying Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics (she doesn't really know what she's doing with her life). She had minimal biology experience in high school but has been excited about synthetic biology ever since she was given a tour around a biohack-space in London and learnt about the possibilities for "hacking" real living organisms, such as growing human chins on the backs of mice or maybe even mouse chins on the backs of humans. She is looking forward to applying mathematical computery techniques to the project and maybe picking up a few squishy lab skills too. Outside of iGEM Alyssa enjoys bobbing her head to electronic music and scavenging for free food.
Jesse Gibson
Jesse Gibson is a rising sophomore in course 6-7: computer science and molecular biology. He became interested in engineering after participating on his high school robotics team and decided to explore synthetic biology as an interesting application of engineering to complex, micro-scale systems.  He is particularly interested in the intersection of technology and biology as well as the design of genetic circuitry to emulate logical input-output systems.  In his free time, he enjoys reading, biking, and playing Super Smash Bros. (Melee, of course).
Wendi Guraziu
Wendi Guraziu is a rising sophomore in the Biology department at MIT. She got hooked on bio in high school and learned about iGEM and synthetic biology in her high school bio and biotechnology classes. She is very excited about the potential of synthetic biology to improve quality and efficiency for the huge number of possible applications in both home and industrial settings. Wendi loves to travel and go on long walks, try tasty foods from every country Italy to Iraq, cheer on her Chicago Blackhawks, and dance like nobody's watching even when everybody's watching. Outside of iGEM, she is involved in Society of Women Engineers and her sorority, Alpha Chi Omega.
Nathan Hunt
Nathan is a junior at MIT studying molecular biology and computer science. He came to MIT to study biology and is often asked how the two fields of his major work together. There are all sorts of great reasons to study biology and computer science, but he really just added it to his major for fun (he’s a believer that one ought to enjoy life, even work). He finds great joy in creating, whether it’s building a complex program up from simple keywords or an interesting biological system. His interest in these two fields led him to be captured by iGEM’s clever poster about programming life. Despite being interested in learning very many things, he’s focusing on biology because he hopes to use his biology and computer and any other sort of knowledge to heal people. On top of MIT and research, Nathan is very involved in his church; he served a two year church mission in Germany and would love it if you would speak German with him. He also enjoys sailing, hiking, learning everything, and wishes he knew robotics.

ADVISORS
Lyla Atta
Lyla Atta is a rising junior in Biological Engineering. She is very interested in cellular biology and biochemistry, and especially interested in applications of these areas to neurobiology. At some point in the far (or near?) future she wishes to find science-based answers to questions that were previously thought to be philosophical: what is thinking, understanding and learning? How do all these processes occur in systems that are made up of mere chemicals. Lyla was part of the 2014 MIT iGEM team. It was the first time she had the opportunity to get some laboratory experience (which she was in dire need of, having never worked in a lab before). She is now working with some of her fellow 2014 iGEM team members on a spin-off project while mentoring this year's iGEM. Outside science-related things, Lyla is very interested in education policy and enjoys outdoor activities.
