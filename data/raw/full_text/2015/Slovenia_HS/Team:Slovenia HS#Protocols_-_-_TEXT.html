Heat shock protocol (transformation)
o Thaw competent cells on ice. Pipet 2 µl of DNA per 100 µl of competent cells.
o Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
o Heat shock the mixture of competent bacteria cells and DNA by placing on  thermoblock or waterbath at 42°C for 45 seconds and then immediately place back  on ice for 5 minutes.
o Add 800 µL LB media to transformed cells. Incubate on 37°C for 30 min with  agitation.
Plasmid DNA purification using centrifuges
o Harvest your bacterial culture (3-10 ml) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes  at room temperature. Decant the supernatant and remove remaining medium. All  other centrifugations should be carried out at 14 000 rpm at room temperature.
o Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of Resuspension Solution. The bacteria should  be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cells  clumps remain.
o Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times  until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
o Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by  inverting the tube 4-6 times.
o Centrifugate the mixture for 5 min.
o Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting ot  pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transfering the white precipitate. Bag with Gene JET  Spin Columns must be closed tightly after each use.
o  Centrifuge the supernatant for 1 min. The flow-through should be discarded and the  column should be placed back into the same collection tube.
o Add 500 µL of the Wash Solution to the GeneJET spin column, centrifuge for 1  minute and discard the flow through, placing the column back into the same  collection tube. Repeat.
o Centrifugate the columns for additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Soulution.  This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
o Transfer the GeneJET spin column should into a fresh 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.  Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to  elute the plasmid DNA. The membrane must not be contacted with the pipette tip.  Incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature and centrifugate for 2 minutes.  Repeat.
o Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.
Making Gel for gel electrophoresis
o Choose the concentration of gel you want to use (e.g. 0.7%, 1%, 2%...)
o Measure out the relevant percentage of agarose powder (e.g. 2g of agarose for  100ml of 2% gel).
o Add the relevant volume of 1xTAE buffer (e.g. 100ml of 1xTAE for 2g of agarose for  2% gel)
o Microwave on low for 1-3 minutes, constantly taking it out every so often to swirl  and mix it. Keep microwaving until clear. Make sure it is completely clear.
o Cool to a temperature that is still hot but still can be held in your hand. If the gel gets  too cold and starts to harden, start microwaving again until clear.
o Add 3µl of ethidium bromide for every 100ml of gel after cooled to the correct  temperature. Mix it well by swirling.
o Pour it onto the gel tray with the combs in place.
o Wait 20-30 minutes until the gel completely solidifies.

o Add 500 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the mixure.
o Mix the suspension by vortexing for 1 minute and incubate on ice for 1 minute  (keeping on ice prevents cells from degradation).. Repeat this step three times.

o Precipitate the DNA with 0,1 volume of 3M NaOAc (sodium acetate) pH 5.5 and 0.6  volume of isopropanol at -20°C for 30 minutes.
o Wash the DNA pellet with 70% ice cold ethanol. Air dry and resuspend in 30 µL of TE  buffer containing 0.002% RNase.

Protocol for expression of CtfA, CtfB and BdhB
Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria were transformed with the expression plasmids and grown in shaker flasks at 37 °C in LBC medium overnight. 1 ml samples were taken for analysis. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 µl of H20. 10 µl samples were taken and 5 µl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added. Samples were cooked at 100 °C for 10 min and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel.
Protocol for isolation of laccases
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) bacteria were transformed with the expression plasmids (BBa_K863005 and BBa_K863010) and grown in 10 ml at 37 °C in LBC medium overnight. To express both recombinant proteins, 10 ml of overnight cultures shaker cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol and shaking with 225 rpm. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM, when the cell density reached an OD600 of 0.8. After induction, cells were grown for 5 h and then collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min. The cell pellet collected from 400 ml of bacterial culture was resuspended in 20 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and sonified 3 × 6 min on ice. Following centrifugation at 30 000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris, the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA Superflow Cartridge (Qiagen) connected to ÄKTA FPLC system, washed with the resuspension buffer and eluted in the same buffer, but containing 250 mM imidazole. The peak fractions were collected and 15 µl of each fraction was collected and resolved on 12 % SDS-PAGE.
