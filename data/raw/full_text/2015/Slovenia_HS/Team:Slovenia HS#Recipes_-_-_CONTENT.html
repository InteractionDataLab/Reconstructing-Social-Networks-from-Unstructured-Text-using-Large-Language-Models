In the beaker, 300 g of inoculum and 100 g of deionized water are precisely weighted for each bioreactor, to allow for a simultaneous preparation of 12 bioreactors. At that point, pH of the solution in each bioreactor is adjusted to 5.7 by means of  2 molar hydrogen chloride. When setting the appropriate pH, the solution is intensely mixed in order to obtain a homogenous solution. The prepared solution is then transferred to each bioreactor (400 g) and the liquid content is purged with Argon for 10 minutes. The reactor contents are sampled and frozen at -20 °C until further analysis. After sampling, the bioreactors are sealed and the integrated mixing devices are activated (200 RPM). The bioreactor is fitted with two sampling ports (one for liquid sampling - we analysed these samples later on a HPLC device, the other for online analysis of the produced gas by GC apparatus) and connected to the gas-measuring flow-through cells. After full assembly of the bioreactors, the headspace (gas space above the liquid broth) of the bioreactor is purged, for 5 minutes. Argon is used because it ensures anaerobic environment, is not produced during our fermentation process (unlike e.g. N2) and does not form compounds with the substances in the reactor or represent a source of food for the inoculum (unlike e.g. CO2). Simultaneously with the test-run, two bioreactors are incubated without any added glucose. These 'blind’ runs serve as a control of inoculum activity. </P><B>Preparation of samples for HLPC measurements</B><P align="justify">Approximately 2 ml of bioreactor contents is sampled through an integrated sampling valve. The precise volume is recorded and exchanged with the same amount of argon, to maintain anaerobic conditions. The samples are marked, weighted and centrifuged (10000 RPM, 20 min). The supernatant is then diluted with ultrapure water and filtered through a 22 µm syringe filter into marked HPLC vials, which are then transferred to HPLC auto sampler for analysis.</P><B>HPLC analysis (Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC, Agilent Technologies) </B>
