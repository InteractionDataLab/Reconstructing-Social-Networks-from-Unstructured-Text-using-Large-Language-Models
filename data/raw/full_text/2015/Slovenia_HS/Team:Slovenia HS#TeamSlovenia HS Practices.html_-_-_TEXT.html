Human practices
When deciding what our human practices would entail, we faced the dilemma of what issues  concerning the society are most urgent to address and by which criteria they should be chosen. At  the end, we settled on focusing on four main goals: connecting to the professionals, reaching out to  public, engaging the youth, and addressing the ethics of both synthetic biology in general and our  project specifically.
CONNECING TO THE PROFESSIONALS
We decided to present our people to the professionals with experience in research and the industry  of biofuel and waste elimination, as well as to the other teams who are competing in iGEM in 2015.  With this spirit we have written several articles about ourselves, our project and the status of  synthetic biology in our country for the Newsletter of iGEM Amoy University team.  We held a video conference with Aalto Helsinki iGEM team, which is also working on the biofuel  problematic. We discussed our respective approaches to the problem and the mechanism of our  solutions. We also presented the project to researchers at the National Chemistry Institute in Ljubljana.
CONNECTING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY
Our project concerning turning organic waste into biofuel is one with a great potential for  development and for eventual industrial stage. With that in mind we have realized that we would  have to visit a real life company that already does something similar, so that we can better imagine  the scale and equipment with which our project would eventually work. There are no cleaning plants  using bacteria yet in Slovenia and our project is unique in that respect, so we have decided to visit a  somewhat similar company. We  went to an algae water cleaning plant AlgEn, built within the  European project AlgaeBioGas, which aims to clean the liquid part of the digestate sediment from  nearby gasworks (dealing with processing slaughterhouse waste) to such extent that the water will  be able to flow directly to local communal water distribution system. This is the only outside  installation of this size in Europe.  They explained their work and research to us and showed us around the plant, carefully explaining  the purpose of equipment on each stage of water purification, as well as showing us their control  room and the systems they use to monitor the process.  Having thus far only worked on a much smaller scale in the laboratory we were fascinated to see the  size of the pool the algae grow in and the main computer monitoring and adjusting the parameters,  which helped us imagine how our project could eventually turned out.  We explained our own work and what we hoped to accomplish and were given some pointers by the  experienced researchers who deal with similar projects every day.

REACHING OUT TO GENERAL PUBLIC
Reaching out to general public, we were faced with two greater problems: public ignorance  concerning synthetic biology and the negative attitude about GMOs.  Explaining our project to friends and family, we realized that people are mostly completely unaware  of what synthetic biology even is, let alone anything more specific, which is understandable.  Humanities and social sciences relate closely and noticeably to our everyday life, and are therefore  more integrated into the general education of citizens of Slovenia. Understanding science, however,  especially something as peculiar to the general public as synthetic biology is, often requires very  specific knowledge that is thought at universities but is less easily accessible otherwise. For instance,  the news on national television covers topics such as politics, international relations and culture  every evening, but science is not often mentioned. Besides just the problem of being unaware, this  minimal representation of science also means it is often not founded well, which affects the future of  our nation more than we might realize.  Moreover, people who are more aware of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, often have a  rather unfavorable attitude towards it, mostly focusing on the potentially negative sides of it, but are  usually unaware of the positive sides, such as production of insulin, artemisinin and other drugs that  were made much more affordable and safe precisely by the use of genetic engineering.  For these two reasons we have decided one of our main priorities would be firstly introducing  synthetic biology to society and secondly addressing the public concerns regarding it.
TRADITIONAL MEDIA
We realized that the way to reach the most people would be by traditional media: newspapers,  television, radio and internet platforms. Therefore, we have contacted and invited reporters and  journalists to both our labs, showed them our work and results and talked about our project. More  importantly we talked about the importance of natural sciences and synthetic biology in particular to  the society, especially when dealing with issues like health, nutrition and the environment.  Our efforts proved fruitful, as we have managed to be featured and seen many times.  We had an interview for Radio Študent, where our team member talked about the iGEM competition  and importance of biofuel. You can hear the full recording (in Slovene) here.  We had two interviews for evening news programs, talking about engagement of youth in sciences,  biobutanol and going from idea to a publicly available functioning product in synthetic biology.

You can see us on evening news Planet Danes on PLANET TV, which is viewed by 65200 people, here.  You can see us on evening news 24ur on POP TV, which is viewed by 194000 people, here.  There was an article about us in the daily newspaper Dnevnik, as well as the Sunday Nedeljski  Dnevnik, read by approximately 319000 people. We talked about the upcoming Giant Jamboree, our  progress on the project and our motivation for choosing natural science as a career path and  applying to iGEM. You can see the contributions here.  In an effort to connect with as many people as possible, we also published a piece about our work  and techniques of synthetic biology on a popular internet platform Metina lista, which you can see  here.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Traditional media is mostly aimed to audiences between 18 and 60 years of age, but we decided not  to be bound by the limitations of traditional media, and expanded our campaign to social media as  well, which is read mostly by our peers, but more and more by the rest of the public as well.  Most read was our facebook page (iGEM HS Slovenia), where we published weekly updates on our  project and interesting articles about advancements in synthetic biology we found as well as pictures  and anecdotes from the lab.  We also created a twitter account (iGEM HS Slovenia) and a web site for sponsors and other people  interested in the details of our work.
PRESENTING TO POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS
While presenting our project to the public is indeed very rewarding, we also found it important to  explain the benefits of synthetic biology to the people who hold the most power in our country, and  are therefore most able to make a difference quickly. We were fortunate enough to be able to  present our project to the highest officials in Slovenia.  Our team representatives attended the 2nd Conference of Young Researchers of Slovenia and  Students from Abroad and Slovenia, the honorary sponsor of which is the president of Slovenia,  Borut Pahor. Slika 3: Attending the conference at the presidential palace We were even prouder to be able to personally present the aim of our research to the prime minister  of Slovenia, Dr. Miro Cerar and to be able to talk to him about the future of science in Slovenia, the  involvement of students in research and about the importance of supporting the inspiring youth for  every country. We were overjoyed to see that the prime minister takes such sincere interest in areas  we are also passionate about and that he understands the importance support for the youth in  science can make. While it is certainly very satisfying to work in a laboratory, such interactions where  you can see what a difference you can make are very rewarding as well. Being able to open  someone's mind, but even more so when is the prime minister's mind, to the important issues of  science and of support for the young scientists is certainly a memorable experience.

ENGAGING THE YOUTH
As young people with great passion for science we found it very important to engage with other  young people.  Presenting synthetic biology to the young has the advantage that they were usually  not already influenced by the negative connotations the words genetic engineering bring with them  and are thus able to listen to us with open minds. It goes without saying that we found it important,  but also very fulfilling to present our project to our peers and connect with them trough common  interests in science.  (There is more to our efforts in presenting synthetic biology to the young, thought. Worrisome  statistics already show, that the young have become less interested in natural science in the recent  years, instead choosing to focus on social sciences, which provide a broad base for acquisition and  processing of experiences and knowledge in real life. High school students are choosing to take final  exams (Slovenian Matura) in natural sciences less, in favor of more socially engaged disciplines, like  history and psychology. Given our own passion for science we are afraid that the students were not  shown the beauty and usefulness of science.-če bi našla kakšne dejanske podatke, da tole tudi  podprem)   We took the saying Children are our future to the heart and made sure to present our project to  children and teenagers as well as adults. We made sure to not only talk about synthetic biology and  our project, but also why science is so important, what had drawn us to it and our experience with it.
PRESENTATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOLS
We had presentations in many secondary school institutions across the country, talking about our  experience and how exciting our project is to our peers. We mostly presented this to students in 3rd  and 4th year of high school, who are just choosing what subjects they should take their exams in and  what university they should apply to. We were hoping to show them that natural sciences are an  exciting and rewarding career path and to inspire and encourage them to pursue science, if that was  their wish. We were glad to see that the students were indeed interested and engaged with us during  and after presentations, asking us questions about the project, synthetic biology, the iGEM  competition and our experience with research.

Some of the presentations were in Slovene, but some, intended to the students pursuing the  International Baccalaureate, were in English.  We had presentations in the following high schools and secondary educational institutions:  - Bežigrad Grammar School  - Diocesan Classical Gymnasium  - Gymnasium Kranj  - Gymmasium Trbovlje  -Jurij Vega Grammar School  -First Grammar School Celje  -Novo Mesto Grammar School  Slika 6: The high school where we presented iGEM
PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENCE FESTIVALS
We made presentations for the wider public as well. Wanting to interact with youth interested in  science, we arranged to present ourselves and iGEM at science festivals.  We spend a day at a booth at ZOTKA's talents science festival. ZOTKS (Association for Technical  Culture of Slovenia) is a society that organizes a research competition for high school and elementary  school children every year. After submitting their research, the finalists are honored and given their  awards at ZOTKA's talents, where they also present their research. Other societies and people with  interesting research to show are invited as well, and the event attracts many visitors: finalists, other  competitors, their families, important researchers, members of Association for Technical Culture and  politicians. We were glad to be able to present our work and the whole field of synthetic biology to  many aspiring young scientists.

We decided to present our project to children as well, and were fortunate enough to be able to make  a presentation at another science festival aimed at younger children and their parents. Hiša  eksperimentov (The House of Experiments) is a museum trying to appeal science to kids. The  museum is full of fun experiments (giant bubbles, a bed of nails, dancing non-Newtonian fluid, visual  tricks etc.) that explain the basic concepts of natural sciences (such as surface tension, the  distribution of forces, electricity, friction…) to young children in an entertaining way. The museum  also has exciting curses, such as ''Eggology'', ''Bubblelogy'' and ''Ice creamology'' to interest children  in science. Every year the museum organizes Znanstival (Sciencetival), a festival of sciences for  families with children, where we presented iGEM and our project as well. We found this presentation  particularly challenging, as the children do not understand more technical concepts of synthetic  biology, but we were able to explain it to them by using metaphors like building a world with legos  and cutting and pasting collages.

Ethics & synthetic biology
Synthetic biology strives towards using engineering principles to the practice of biology and  makes the development of biological systems possible, including development of entire  organisms, which don’t exist in nature and serve solely specified human purposes. Synthetic  biology relies on genetic engineering techniques of recombinant DNA that were first  developed in the 1970s, but synthetic biology hopes to bring these techniques many steps  forward. It aims at the development of genetic sequences that can serve as standardized  modules and be used in standardized platform organisms to cause those organisms to  exhibit predictable behaviours.
This rapidly advancing technology raises ethical questions about benefits and harms that  have not been thoroughly addressed and are subject to a worldwide debate. For example,  many countries of the EU are attempting to completely ban the use of GMOs in agriculture  and food, but on the other hand, many other countries such as the USA are growing more  and more genetically modified crops. Synthetic organisms raise questions about public  health, environmental contamination, and even abuse. This technology could be very  dangerous, if it ever falls into the wrong hands, since it could be used for bioterrorism. Other  concerns that have a more religious nature are about the very idea of creating synthetic  organisms. These tap into our instincts about what is natural and what is our relationship to  the natural world, but also about the intrinsic value of human creativity and industry.
But like most things, not even synthetic biology is purely black and white. It also opens door  to numerous practical applications of living organisms, especially bacteria. It could make our  lives easier, safer and better and could even help us to do more to preserve the  environment. Medicine, agriculture, waste treatment, fuel production and pharmaceutics  are just some of the possible are where synthetic biology could mean an enormous  breakthrough and a solution to many of our problems. One possible invention it could bring  is personalized medicine tailored to each individual. These would be more efficient than  normal medicines and would also cause fewer side effects. Also, in most cases these  applications would require GMOs, safely trapped in bioreactors; therefore the fear of these  organisms being released into naturel is redundant.

At the end, both the risks and benefits have to be taken into consideration when deciding on  ethical questions of this kind and the decision should be made simply by determining which prevail.
