undoubtedly be your main concern.  Work safety includes everything from proper

equipment such as protective gloves, glasses, lab coat etc., to adequate preparations and

proper disposal of chemicals and organisms.</P><H3>Our experience with lab safety</H3><P align="justify">Prior to this project we had already worked in a laboratory, either at school, in a research

facility or in some other way. This way we had acquired a lot of experience in this field and

were fully aware the importance of lab safety. It is a responsibility you have towards yourself

and others working with you. </P><P align="justify"> That is why before even stepping into a laboratory we had a mandatory work and laboratory

safety lecture at the National Institute of Chemistry. We revised and upgraded our previous

knowledge on this topic and after passing the exam we were fully prepared and educated on

the topic of safe laboratory work. Prof. dr. Marko Dolinar, a member of the Slovene Scientific

committee for work with GMOs in contained use, gave us a lecture on genetically modified

organism and concerns regarding their use and safety. Additionally, we also watched two

educational videos, which were provided to us by iGEM and gave us further information on

how to work with living microorganism and how to handle GMOs.

but in case of chemicals such as butyric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and

ethidium bromide, special caution was required. When handling with ethidium bromide,

which is considered mutagen, carcinogen and teratogen, we were especially careful. We

consistently used the stronger (purple) nitrile gloves and were cautious not to touch

unnecessary objects when using them to prevent contamination of surfaces and equipment

with ethidium bromide and maintain the required level of safety. In any case, ethidium

bromide can only be used in the so-called 'electrophoresis lab'. No equipement or

consumables used for work with ethidium bromide is allowed to leave this lab (except for

waste sealed in a bag).</P><I>Left photo: We always used protective gear. Right photo: Zala using fume hood.</I><H3>Organisms</H3><P align="justify">We worked in a Level 1 laboratory, because all the organism (Escherichia coli and Clostridium

acetobutylicum) and parts we were using fall into this biosafety category. Both bacteria are

safe to use since they pose a minimal potential threat to people in the laboratory and do not

consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Nevertheless, we were precautious and used

proper disinfectant to clean the laminar flow cabinet and other working areas as some of the

E. coli we were using during our research was of course genetically modified.

Working in a dedicated molecular biology lab our working space is separate from the rest of

the facility. Our lab is a part of a department which again is separated from the rest of the

building by a door that locks automatically, so that the access to the department is

controlled. Work was preformed on an open lab table. Personal protective gear (lab coat and

gloves) was worn at all times and was supplemented with eye and ear protection as needed

(for example for work with UV light or sonication).  All liquid waste was autoclaved before

being discharged. Solid waste was collected separately and disposed by inicineration by an

independent  contractor. A sink for hand washing and 70% ethanol was available for

sterilisation at all times if needed.</P><H3>Butanol</H3><P align="justify">Butanol as our main product, when produced in adequate quantities, would be used in

standard Otto gasoline engines as a propellant. Since this engine is one of two most common

engines, the other one being the diesel engine, we had to consider several aspects of

butanol`s broad use, including safety and possible impact it would have on the environment.</P><P align="justify">Butanol is according to the <A href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0111.html"> CDC</A> harmful to health.  It causes

damage if inhaled, ingested or if it comes in contact with skin or eyes. Inhalation of vapours

may cause headache, nausea, drowsiness and dizziness and irritation of the respiratory tract.

Ingestion may result in vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dizziness and

drowsiness. Exposure to the eyes and skin causes irritation, redness and pain. </P><P align="justify">1-Butanol has low water solubility, is biodegradable and therefore not expected to

significantly accumulate in nature. In open spaces, at normal temperature, 1-butanol

decomposes due to photolysis. It is a combustible and flammable liquid, sensible to static

discharges. Flash point of butanol is 29°C so spontaneous ignition is possible on hot days. </P><P align="justify">But compared to gasoline butanol is much safer to use. Gasoline is more hazardous to health

as butanol, because in addition to skin, eye and respiratory irritation, dizziness and

drowsiness, it is also mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction, causes damage to

organs (liver, kidneys, bladder, blood, bone marrow, nervous system) through prolonged or

repeated exposure and may be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. Gasoline`s flash point is -43°C

and as such significantly lower than the flash point of butanol. In addition gasoline poses a

greater threat to the environment than butanol, because it is poisonous to aquatic life.

during production, transportation and storage. Possible dangers of its use could be

eliminated with the same preventive measures that are already implemented for other

flammable liquid car fuels.</P><H3>Butyric acid</H3><P align="justify">Butyric acid is a medium-strong carboxylic acid. Because it is the first and most important

substrate of our engineered metabolic path, its dangers should be taken into consideration

before any large-scale production of butanol is established. Butyric acid is corrosive and can

cause pain, redness and severe deep burns on skin and loss of vision. If ingested, it can cause

abdominal pain, shock or collapse. Inhalation may result in sore throat, cough, burning

sensation, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. <A href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng1334.html">Butyric acid safety sheet</A> It is

also combustible and forms explosive vapours above 72°C. With proper action these dangers

should be eliminated.</P></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
