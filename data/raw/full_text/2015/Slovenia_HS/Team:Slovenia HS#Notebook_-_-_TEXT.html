Our Journey
 
''If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go  together.''
- African proverb -
  The beginning of our journey
 
When we first saw that The National Institute of Chemistry was looking for team members  to present the colours of Slovenia iGEM HS Division, we thought it would be a great  opportunity to do what something we were interested in and learn something new. We  applied to the call for applications and hoped for the best. Parts of the application  procedure were writing a motivational letter, attending an interview, taking part in a  personality test and, the toughest of them all, solve a scientific problem.
 14 months ago, we knew nothing about synthetic biology because we only learned the  basics in our biology and chemistry classes. We had no clue how demanding the project is  going to be at the time.
Building a knowledge basis
 
When we started with our team meetings in September and October 2014,  we first had to  learn the basics of biochemistry and biotechnology.  Through autumn and winter we have  had having lessons two afternoons per week after school. We learned about cloning,  plasmids, PCR and biobricks. Moreover, we learned how to edit wiki pages, use  bioinformatics programs and data bases. At the same time we were also studying the  additional literature and developing our ideas. We learned about E. coli, conditions for its  optimal growth and bioreactors. Finally, we got to enter the labs where we practiced basic  lab techniques and protocols, such as pipetting with micropipettes. We also cut the vectors  with restriction enzymes for the first time and tested our samples using agarose gel  electrophoresis.  It needless to say how fascinated we were when we were actually able to  see several pieces of DNA of different lengths.  It was a great experience because we were tutored by university professors and scientists  who were really able to explain to us everything thoroughly.
So Let’s get to work!
 
We visited the the company AlgEn, which was a unique exprence which helped us shape our ideas for our project and design the experiments better. Afterwards, we started regularly working in labs of the National Institute of Chemistry and the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology.
   When we first actually started working in the lab we wanted to obtain the genes needed for  building our construct from a mixed culture which we knew also contained Clostridium. We  wanted to do so because The Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering  already used this culture for their own experiments and we wanted to make use of it as  well. As our DNA purification from mixed culture was unsuccessful we decided to go a step  further and order pure culture and purify the DNA out of it. However, this was also  unsuccessful and we decided to order synthetic DNA segments from IDT Technologies.  These arrived in late June and since then we spent more or less every day in the lab.
  Summer of tears and sweat (and empty AGE gels)
We spent the following months sweating in the lab. Our days consisted of cloning, doing  colony PCRs, testing our samples, hoping for positive results of agarose gel electrophoresis  and crying as this was rarely the case. At the same time we prepared different media to  see what best suits for E. coli's growth, measured absorbance, worked in both aerobic and  anaerobic conditions (the following were especially fun), carried out the ecotoxicological  tests, isolated n-butanol, prepared different media again and analysed tons of results.
There is life outside the lab too…
 
Besides the lab work we also filmed a short clip about our project and presented our project  and principles of synthetic biology to a wider audience. We met the Slovenian prime  minister while doing so and made sure he understood what we were trying to accomplish. We established our very first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, wrote articles,  collaborated with other iGEM teams, searched for sponsors and designed our wiki.
The lessons we learned
To be honest, we have never imagined how demanding it would be to manage such a  project. In fact, it turned out to be much more than just a scientific research. Being a part of  this project was a great opportunity to experience real-life scientific teamwork, develop  organisational and leadership skills. On the other hand we had to overcome a lot of obstacles, from having troubles with  bureaucracy to not being able to get our vectors into bacteriae. It was then when we  realized only we are the ones responsible for the project and that it is on us to reach out for  help. We learned that in the end you always have to do what you have to do, no matter how  hard it may seem. Perhaps the crucial lesson of this summer was about the importance of  collaboration with others or, to put it another way, to stick together through thick and  thin.

we set restrictions and AGE of:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt as BI
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt as BV
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt as BI
R: restrictions are succeful
we isolate the samples from the gel and set ligation over night:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with prom+RBS+ctfB+dt (BI)
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with
•prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt (BI)
SDS-page, we make two gels, one to be coloured, the other for bloting: •pSB1c3+prom+RBS+GFP+ctfB+dt
R: some bands of appropriate size appear
western blot and colouring of pSB1c3+prom+RBS+GFP+ctfB+dt
R: nothing shows on the membrane
we set restrictions over night:
•pSB1c3+GFP as BI
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt as BV
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt as BI
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt as BI
10. 9. 2015
we do the AGE of yesterday's restrictions, isolate them from the gel and set ligations for two hours:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS (BV) ligated with GFP (BI)
•pSB1c3+prom+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with prom+RBS+ctfB+dt (BI)
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt (BI)
we transform the cells with today's and yesterday's ligations:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS (BV) ligated with GFP (BI)
•pSB1c3+prom+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with prom+RBS+ctfB+dt (BI)
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt (BV) ligated with prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt (BI)

•colony PCR and AGE of pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
R: some samples seem to be succesful
11. 9.2015
SDS-page, we make two gels, one for colouring, other for bloting:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
R: all samples seem to show the same results
we do western blot on one of the gels and colour the memebrane
R: the membrane shows nothing of note
we set restrictions and AGE, we cut all samples with EcoRl and Pstl to check the size of fragments:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
R: they all cut the same, which means the colony PCR were false pfitives and we have not managed to ligate anything togheter
colony PCR and AGE:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+GFP
•pSB1c3+prom+ctfA+dt+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt
R: some samples seem to be succesful
expression and SDS-page of BBa_K733012 and BBa_K863010
R: unsuccesful

R: bands appear
we set restriction and AGE:
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfA+dt as BV
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+ctfB+dt as BI, BV
•pSB1c3+prom+RBS+bdhB+dt as BI
