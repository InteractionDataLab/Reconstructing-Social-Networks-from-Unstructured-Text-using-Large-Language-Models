o Thaw competent cells on ice. Pipet 2 µl of DNA per 100 µl of competent cells.

o Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.

o Heat shock the mixture of competent bacteria cells and DNA by placing on

thermoblock or waterbath at 42°C for 45 seconds and then immediately place back

on ice for 5 minutes.

o Add 800 µL LB media to transformed cells. Incubate on 37°C for 30 min with

agitation.<B>Plasmid DNA purification using centrifuges</B>

o Harvest your bacterial culture (3-10 ml) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes

at room temperature. Decant the supernatant and remove remaining medium. All

other centrifugations should be carried out at 14 000 rpm at room temperature.

o Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 µL of Resuspension Solution. The bacteria should

be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cells

clumps remain.

o Add 250 µL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times

until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.

o Add 350 µL of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by

inverting the tube 4-6 times.

o Centrifugate the mixture for 5 min.

o Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by decanting ot

pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transfering the white precipitate. Bag with Gene JET

Spin Columns must be closed tightly after each use.

o  Centrifuge the supernatant for 1 min. The flow-through should be discarded and the

column should be placed back into the same collection tube.

o Add 500 µL of the Wash Solution to the GeneJET spin column, centrifuge for 1

minute and discard the flow through, placing the column back into the same

collection tube. Repeat.

o Centrifugate the columns for additional 1 min to remove residual Wash Soulution.

This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.

o Transfer the GeneJET spin column should into a fresh 1,5 ml microcentrifuge tube.

Add 50 µL of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET spin column membrane to

elute the plasmid DNA. The membrane must not be contacted with the pipette tip.

Incubated for 2 minutes at room temperature and centrifugate for 2 minutes.

Repeat.

o Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.<B>Making Gel for gel electrophoresis</B>

o Choose the concentration of gel you want to use (e.g. 0.7%, 1%, 2%...)

o Measure out the relevant percentage of agarose powder (e.g. 2g of agarose for

100ml of 2% gel).

o Add the relevant volume of 1xTAE buffer (e.g. 100ml of 1xTAE for 2g of agarose for

2% gel)

o Microwave on low for 1-3 minutes, constantly taking it out every so often to swirl

and mix it. Keep microwaving until clear. Make sure it is completely clear.

o Cool to a temperature that is still hot but still can be held in your hand. If the gel gets

too cold and starts to harden, start microwaving again until clear.

o Add 3µl of ethidium bromide for every 100ml of gel after cooled to the correct

temperature. Mix it well by swirling.

o Pour it onto the gel tray with the combs in place.

o Wait 20-30 minutes until the gel completely solidifies.

o Place the agarose gel into electrophoresis unit.

o Add loading buffer to each of your samples.

o Fill the electophoresis unit with 1xTAE until the gel is completely covered.

o Load 7 µl of molecular weight ladder into the first well and load your samples in

additional wells.

o Run the gel at 90V-120V and 400 mA until the dye line is half the way down the gel

(30-45 minutes).

o View the gel in a device with UV light.<B>DNA extraction from sludge</B>

o Add 500 µL (0,2g) of sludge to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifugate at 14,000 rpm

10 minutes.

o Lyse the sludge pellet by adding equal volume of sterile glass beads and 500µL of

extraction buffer hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).

o Mix the suspension by vortexing  for 1minute.

o Add 500 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the mixure.

o Mix the suspension by vortexing for 1 minute and incubate on ice for 1 minute

(keeping on ice prevents cells from degradation).. Repeat this step three times. 

o Centrifugate the mixture at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant

to a new microcentrifuge tube.

o Repeated the phenol extraction with 500 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol

(24:1) and centrifugate at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.

o Precipitate the DNA with 0,1 volume of 3M NaOAc (sodium acetate) pH 5.5 and 0.6

volume of isopropanol at -20°C for 30 minutes.

o Wash the DNA pellet with 70% ice cold ethanol. Air dry and resuspend in 30 µL of TE

buffer containing 0.002% RNase.

o The extracted DNA is used for following PCR amplification.<B>DNA gel extraction</B>

o Excise gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade and

place  into a clean 1,5 mL tube.

o Add 500 µL of Binding Buffer.

o Incubate the mixture on 60 °C for 10 minutes until the gel slice is completely

dissolved. Vortex the gel mixture briefly before loading on the column.

o Transfer up to 800 µL of the solubilized gel solution to the GeneJET purification

column. Centrifugate for 1 minute. Discard the flow through and place the column

back in the same collection tube.

o Add 700 µL of Wash Buffer. Centrifugate for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and

place the column back into the same collection tube .

o Centrifugate the empty GeneJET purification column for 1 minute to remove residual

Wah Buffer. 

o Transfer the GeneJET purification column into fresh 1,5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

Add 10 µL of Elution Buffer to the centre of purification column membrane. 

Centrifugate the mixture for 1 minute.<B>Isolation of proteins:</B><U>Sample preparation:</U>
