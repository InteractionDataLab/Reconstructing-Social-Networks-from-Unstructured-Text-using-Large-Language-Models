The genes were ordered from <A href="https://eu.idtdna.com/site">IDT.</A>
The genes needed for our project were CtfA, CtfB and BdhB. <P>The pathway of conversion</P><P align="justify">CtfA and CtfB are the genes coding the  two polipeptide chains forming CtfAB (CoA-transferase) enzyme, that is in Clostridium acetobutylicum responsible for conversion of butyrate to butyryl-CoA. BdhB is the gene coding the butanol dehydrogenase enzyme, that is in Clostridium acetobutylicum responsible for conversion of butyryl-CoA to butanol.</P><P align="justify">All the DNA fragments ordered includes the CtfA, CtfB or BdhB gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum (NCBI: CAP0163) with a C-terminal His-tag, which has been codon optimized for expression in E. coli.</P><P>The sequences we ordered</P><H3>1.

PROTEIN EXPRESSION</H3><P align="justify">Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria were transformed with the expression plasmids and grown in shaker flasks at 37 °C in LBC medium overnight. 1 ml samples were taken for analysis. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 µl of H20. 10 µl samples were taken and 5 µl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added. Samples were cooked at 100 °C for 10 min and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. </P><P>SDS-PAGE of construct containing CtfA.

A dilute solution of primary antibody was incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for an hour. Then a dilute solution was incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for an hour as well. The hydrogen peroxide method was for visualisation. </P><P>Membrane after Western blot of the construct containing CtfA.
