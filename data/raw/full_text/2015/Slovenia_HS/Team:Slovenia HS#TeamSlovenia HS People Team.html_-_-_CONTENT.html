enthusiasts. As we attend 7 different secondary educational institutions across all

Slovenia we are a very diverse team. We are all honoured to be the first Slovenian

high school team to take part in the iGEM HS competition and face the challenges

the synthetic biology poses.</P></DIV><CENTER><HEADER><P><I>''Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much''</I></P><H3>-Helen Keller</H3></HEADER></CENTER><DIV align="justify">We joined our knowledge and experience under the supervision of the National

Institute of Chemistry Slovenia and the Chair of Biochemistry of the Faculty of

Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the University Ljubljana, who also selected

the team members among 32 applicants. For the application procedure we had to

write a personal statement about our passion for this area of research, attend an

interview and work out a thorough project design challenge.

As we are still only high school students with very little experience in synthetic

biology we could not start working on our project straight away (even though we

wanted to). Instead, we had to sit a few lessons first.

Throughout these we extended our knowledge on our field of work by learning the

basics of biotechnology, synthetic biology, lab safety and by practicing basic lab

protocols.
</DIV>

Because of the complexity of our project we formulated 2 working groups afterwards:<B>Synthetic biologists</B>, who were responsible for building our construct by using principles of synthetic biology.<B>Biotechnologists</B>, who aimed to find the optimal conditions under which our construct would produce the highest possible yield of biobutanol within our genetically modified and optimized bioreactor system
<DIV align="justify">The synthetic biologists carried out their wet-lab research at the Faculty of Chemistry

and Chemical Technology while the biotechnologists preformed their research at the

National Institute of Chemistry. At the same tame we held all-group meetings to

share our results and experience and work on our project thoroughly.

Kranj Grammar School<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">I am interested in synthetic biology because of the promising improvements and facilitation of daily life situations. In synthetic biology there is still so much unknown and undiscovered and I wish to narrow that gap. The favorite part of our project was learning about genetic modification and when the first electrophoresis was done. It fascinates me that we can basically modify them in almost any way imaginable, change and cut DNA sequences. I found great passion, happiness and inspiration in chemistry and biology and synthetic biology partially combines both of the above mentioned sciences. But the crucial and the key thing is that besides all the research we do, we widen our knowledge and our horizons, search for new, alternative, better and more effective solutions for the problems, which pest the society nowadays.<DIV><B>Responsibilities:</B>lab work, fundraising campaign organisation, project clip, collaboration

Synthetic biologist<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">Because by taking parts of many different natural biological systems and standardising them, we can

make complicated processes relatively simple and efficient in solving many of the world's problems,

such as disease, pollution, and energetics.

Furthermore, it is a novel approach to learning about and understanding the natural world around

us, and what is cooler than that?<B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B>

For me the absolute favorite part is the rush after looking at your results and realizing  they were

finally succesful and that the biological systems you designed are working like you want them to.

There is nothing else like it.</DIV><B>Responsibilities:</B> leader of synthetic biologists, lab work, planning, collaboration, reaching out to public, project clip
