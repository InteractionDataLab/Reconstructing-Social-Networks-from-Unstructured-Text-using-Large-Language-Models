Attributions & acknowledgements
We did most of our work by ourselves. This stands for project organisation, planning, carrying out the experimental work, fund raising, social media, reaching out to public, photographing, documenting our work and writing the wiki content.
However, we thank dr. Marina Klemenčič and prof. dr. Marko Dolinar for their lectures on basics of synthetic biology, gene expression, cloning, wiki editing and biosafety as well as for their assistance at all stages of our work when facing troubles.
We thank dr. Marina Klemenčič for her basic lab protocols trainings in which we learned the basic lab techniques in synthetic biology. Besides that, we thank her for her extensive help and assistance with our lab work in synthetic biology lab at all stages of work.
We thank dr. Ilja Gasan Osojnik Črnivec for his lectures on basics of biotechnology, bioreactors and E. coli metabolism as well as for his help in searching for sponsors. We thank him as well as all members of L05 Laboratory for Environmental Sciences and Engineering for their assistance and support of biotechnology work  when we needed to work out problems at work in the lab.
We thank dr. Albin Pintar for helping to coordinate our project and our journey to USA.
We thank Adrejaana Andova for designing our wiki template and support with uploading the content on our wiki.
We thank Simon Hočevar for his help with setting up our wiki page.
We thank Rok Štupar and Pingpong produkcija d.o.o. for filming our project clip for our fundraising campaign and taking some of our portraits.
We thank the staff of National Institute of Chemistry Slovenia for their assistance with the administrative part of our project, regarding the registration, trip organisation, etc.
We thank chemistry and biology teachers at our schools who helped us to organize work on the project and our work in school.
We thank Jože Ocepek and Celk for his willingness to help by fundraising campaign on Indiegogo.
We thank Hiša eksperimentov Ljubljana, Zotkini talenti, Debate club of Bežigrad Grammar School, Jurij Vega Grammar School, Gymmasium Trbovlje and Novo mesto Grammar School for their support by our projects for Human practice.
Lastly, we would like to thank our donors who contributed to make our dream of attending the iGEM HS competition come true.
