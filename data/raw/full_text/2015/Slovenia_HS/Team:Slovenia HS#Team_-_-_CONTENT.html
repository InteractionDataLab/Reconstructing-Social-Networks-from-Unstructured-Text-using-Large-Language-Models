enthusiasts. As we attend 7 different secondary educational institutions across all

Slovenia we are a very diverse team. We are all honoured to be the first Slovenian

high school team to take part in the iGEM HS competition and face the challenges

the synthetic biology poses.</P></DIV><CENTER><HEADER><P><I>''Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much''</I></P><H3>- Helen Keller -</H3></HEADER></CENTER><DIV align="justify">We joined our knowledge and experience under the supervision of the National

Institute of Chemistry Slovenia and the Chair of Biochemistry of the Faculty of

Chemistry and Chemical Technology of the University Ljubljana, who also selected

the team members among 32 applicants. For the application procedure we had to

write a personal statement about our passion for this area of research, attend an

interview and work out a thorough project design challenge.

As we are still only high school students with very little experience in synthetic

biology we could not start working on our project straight away (even though we

wanted to). Instead, we had to sit a few lessons first.

Throughout these we extended our knowledge on our field of work by learning the

basics of biotechnology, synthetic biology, lab safety and by practicing basic lab

protocols.
</DIV><DIV align="justify">We carried out their wet-lab research at the Faculty of Chemistry

and Chemical Technology while the biotechnologists preformed their research at the

National Institute of Chemistry. At the same tame we held all-group meetings to

share our results and experience and work on our project thoroughly.

In synthetic biology there is still so much unknown and undiscovered and I wish to narrow that gap. The favorite part of our project was learning about genetic modification and when the first electrophoresis was done. It fascinates me that we can basically modify them in almost any way imaginable, change and cut DNA sequences. I found great passion, happiness and inspiration in chemistry and biology and synthetic biology partially combines both of the above mentioned sciences. But the crucial and the key thing is that besides all the research we do, we widen our knowledge and our horizons, search for new, alternative, better and more effective solutions for the problems, which pest the society nowadays.<DIV><B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B><DIV align="justify">The favorite part of our project was learning about genetic modification and when the first

Gymnasium Trbovlje<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">Synthetic biology really offers countless opportunities for creating new, important

solutions.There was dramatic development of synthetic biology in last few years and therefore I can

not imagine how much can synthetic biology still give to us to improve our lives in the next years. It

is quite amazing how we can, by using synthetic biologic methods, create extensive  biologic

systems.</DIV><B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B><DIV align="justify"> Our work was focused on genetic modification of

bacteria. I spent most of time in laboratory working with microorganisms. I enjoyed working with

bacteria, which are really very unpredictable. You simply can’t imagine how many factors have to be

satisfied for successful results. That is really the “mistery” of science work and it makes it attractive.

First Grammar School Celje<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify"> Synthetic biology brings basic science to a whole new - applicative level. It's a field of science that,

one one hand, opens up a new perspective on the world, and on the other, serves as a source for solutions to 

global problems of the modern world. The thing that sparks my interest the most with synthetic biology is, that it ranges in all aspects

of life; from health to environment.</DIV><B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B><DIV align="justify">Maybe it sounds cliché, but what I was truly charmed by, in science and research, is that you

never know what is going to happen with your experiment if you change a parameter and what the

output is going to be. Bacteria are living creatures that act completely different from, for instance,

anorganic compounds, which are very predictable. It's the intricacy of living organisms that makes

research truly interesting and exciting!</DIV><B>Responsibilities:</B> lab work, graphical design, wiki design, project clip, poster, tracking protocols </TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>Domen Kulovec</H3>

That’s why I was more than happy when I was told that I'll be part of this story. This was great opportunity for me to work in more than well equipped, gain new knowledges, experiences and friendships.

Bežigrad Grammar School<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">Synthetic biology absolutely fascinates me because there is so much that could be done

using its methods! I think the whole field of synthetic biology is unbelievably promising: from

applications in medicine, pharmacy, to industry and even fuel production. Every time I think of what

else could be created my imagination blooms with ideas and this is what really makes me feel

inspired and motivates me.</DIV><B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B><DIV align="justify">I would say the best part of our project was the fact that we were given the opportunity to

work under the surveillance of such amazing mentors. I enjoyed every single day in the lab

Novo mesto Grammar School<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">If I had been asked about synthetic biology at the beginning of my high school career, I would have

probably tried to overcome the »words failed me« moment and do absolutely everything to hide the

fact that I don't have a single clue about it. Through years, I have come across this new, modern, and

vital science that showed me that rather than learn about biological concepts on their own trying to

apply them to a bunch of random unrealistic problems; it came like an unexpected solution that can

be directly applied to &quot;real life&quot; problems and situations.</DIV><B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B><DIV align="justify">Working in laboratory, I have soon realized that the key for successful research is combining various

sciences and knowledge of scientists from several areas of expertise to create a

multidisciplinary research. Although our project is primary focused on synthetic biology, it

combines elements from chemistry, ecology, and chemical engineering. Only when combined

together, they can form a project that can offer a possible solution to one of the future

world's most important problems.</DIV><B>Responsibilities:</B> planning, lab work</TD></TR><TR><TD><H3>Nina Jerala</H3>
Diocesan Classical Gymnasium<B>Why are you interested in synthetic biology?</B><DIV align="justify">Because by taking parts of many different natural biological systems and standardising them, we can

make complicated processes relatively simple and efficient in solving many of the world's problems,

such as disease, pollution, and energetics.

Furthermore, it is a novel approach to learning about and understanding the natural world around

us, and what is cooler than that?<B>What was your favorite part of the project?</B>

For me the absolute favorite part is the rush after looking at your results and realizing  they were

finally succesful and that the biological systems you designed are working like you want them to.

There is nothing else like it.</DIV><B>Responsibilities:</B> lab work, planning, collaboration, reaching out to public, project clip</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><H2>Mentors and advisors</H2><TBODY><TR><TD><H3>Dr. Ilja Gasan Osojnik Črnivec</H3>
