Step 2. - Incubation
We incubated our samples in a heat block at 50°C for 15 minutes when 2 or 3 fragments are being assembled or 60 minutes when 4-6 fragments are being assembled. Samples were kept on ice or at –20°C for subsequent transformation. If an assembly did not show good results, we repeated the protocol with extended incubation times as suggested on the NEB website.
Step 3. - Transformation
Samples were then used in 2ul aliquots to transform competent cells.

Pipette 200ul of each curve sample into a well.
Add 30ul of Phosphate Reagent to each well
Leave to equilibrate for 30 mins at room temperature. N.B the reagent is light sensitive so store in a dark room while equilbrating
Sample preparation
N.B. Make sure our sample is diluted to ensure the readings are within the standard value range.
Steps for cell (adherent or suspension) samples:
Harvest the amount of cells necessary for each assay (initial recommendation = 2 x 10^6 cells).
Wash cells with cold TBS (kept in 4oC fridge, stable for 3 months).
Resuspend the cell pellet in 150 µL of Assay Buffer (TBS) on ice.
Homogenize cells quickly by pipetting up and down a few times.
Sonicate cells for 50 seconds 3X at high setup (one cycle = 30 s sonication – 10 s break – 10 s sonication – 10 s break).
Centrifuge sample for 15 minutes at 4°C at top speed using a cold microcentrifuge to remove any insoluble material.
Collect supernatant and transfer to a clean tube.
Keep on ice
Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) Recipe
50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5
150 mM NaCl
To prepare, dissolve 6.05 g and 8.76 g NaCl in 800 mL of H2O.
Adjust pH to 7.5 with 1 M HCl
Tris Make volume up to 1 L with H2O.
N.B. TBS is stable at 4°C for 3 mo.
Phosphate assay using media
Phosphate assay will work with media, however LB is not recommended due to high phosphate amount cause precipitation when tested.  Instead 1x MOPS media, 4 mg/ml glucose and a known concentration of phosphate can be used. A recommend of 1mM phosphate can be used to get adequate cell growth without causing precipitation providing media is diluted by a 1in 20 dilution. Alternatively lower concentration can be used however growth will be affected. To see difference between samples, cells in exponential phase need to be captured and OD600 can be used to standardize against cell count. With MOPS 1mM phosphate an average time of 6 hours is recommend.
Assay procedure and detection
Equilibrate all materials and prepared reagents to room temperature prior to use. It is recommended to assay all standards, controls and samples in duplicate.
Set up Reaction wells:
Standard wells = 200 µL standard dilution.
Sample wells = 1 – 100 µL samples (adjust volume to 200 µL/well with ddH2O).
Background control sample wells = 1 – 100 samples (adjust volume to 200 µL/well with ddH2O).
Add 30 µL of Phosphate Reagent to standard, sample and background control wells.
Mix and incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes protected from light.
Measure output at OD = 650 nm on a microplate reader.

Growth Assay - Plate Reader
Materials
96 well plate
10x MOPS Media (dilute to 1X)
K2HPO4 (dipotassium phosphate)
@0.1 mM for low P
@1.32 mM for high P - suggested by MOPS media recipe
4 mg/mL glucose
Strains of bacteria
Purpose
Used to measure bacterial density by tracking absorbance at intervals of 30 minutes for 24 or 48 hours (220 rpm, 37°C)
Procedure
Day 1
Prepare the phosophate concentrations and filter sterilize them
Prepare the glucose solution and filter sterilize them
Prepare 1X MOPS (from 10X solution) filter sterilize them
Prepare overnights
5ml of LB in a BD falcon tube
Take a colony off the plate with a sterile toothpick and put in falcon tube
Leave overnight at 37°C in a shaker
Day 2
Transfer overnight culture into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes
Spin down overnights - 3 min at 4K
Wash out with MOPS and resuspend with 1 mL MOPS
Repeat spin step and resuspend again
Measure OD650 of a 10 fold dilution of cells with a spectrophotometer blanked with MOPS
Calculate the amount of inocula required  for a final OD650 of 0.4 in 500 uL
Set up wells - 2 uL phosphate, 5 uL cells, 193 uL MOPS
Manual growth assay
A manual growth assay can be conducted using a spectrometer at OD650. Samples are prepared in 50ml LB as (> 12hrs) in a 250ml conical flask, as MOPS media can be too slow. An initial start OD650 of 0.1 is used and then 1ml of sample can be removed from the conical flask hourly and optical density taken. These can then be plotted onto a growth curve and if desired sample can be detect from phosphate assay though for reliable media testing results MOPS would be recommended.
