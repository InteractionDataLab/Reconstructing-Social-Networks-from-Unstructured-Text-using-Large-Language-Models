University of York
The University of York is a member of the elite Russell Group of universities and is a dynamic, research-intensive university committed to the development of life-saving discoveries and new technologies to tackle some of the most pressing global challenges. The University opened in 1963 with just 230 students. Since then it has become one of the world's leading universities, carving out a reputation as an academic powerhouse where a clear focus on excellence has secured national and international recognition alongside longer established institutions. We would particularly like to thank Professor Brian Fulton, Dean of the Faculty for the Sciences, for the allocation of funds towards our project.
Department of Biology, University of York
One of the UK’s elite university biological sciences departments.  The Research Excellence assessment (2014) has again placed Biology at York in the Top 10 in the UK and in 1st place for impact outside academia with its research having major influence on environmental policy, industry and health.  In teaching, it retains a position in the top five biological sciences programmes in the UK, according to the most widely-used indicators published by The Times and The Guardian and the department scores highly for student satisfaction in the National Students Survey. We would like to thank the department for the generous financial support given towards our project, including the Giant Jamboree registration, travel and co-funding our student stipends through the joint iGEM funding scheme.
Department of Computer Science, University of York
A leading department for Computer Science in the UK, and is consistently highly ranked in UK league tables and for student satisfaction.
