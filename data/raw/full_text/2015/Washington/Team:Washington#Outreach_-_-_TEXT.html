Auxin Background
Insert text
For commercial shellfish farmers and recreational hunters alike, marine biotoxins pose a significant threat to health and welfare. With this project, we aim to create an inexpensive and easy-to-use test kit for the detection of the shellfish toxin okadaic acid using engineered yeast strains and DNA aptamers on a paper device. We also hope that this project paves the way for a new class of biosensors capable of detecting a wide range of small molecules.
