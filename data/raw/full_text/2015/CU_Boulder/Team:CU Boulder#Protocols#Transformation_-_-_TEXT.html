Chemical Transformation
Before starting
Heat hot plate or water bath to 42°C
Optional: Warm selection plates to 37°C
Transformation
Thaw chemically competent cells on ice for 10-15 minutes
Add 40ul cells to fresh 1.7mL tube
Strongly recommended: set up an extra sample as a negative control. Do not add DNA to this sample
Add DNA
If using a ligation product add up to 10ul of sample
If using supercoiled plasmid add 100ng
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock cells on hot plate (or water bath) for 30-45s* @ 42°C
Incubate on ice for 2-5 minutes
Recovery:
Option 1: Recover in 200ul
 Add 200 μL SOC and shake gently for 1-2 hours @ 37°C
Option 2: Recover in 960ul
Add 960ul of SOC and shake gently for 1-2 hours @ 37°C
Gently spin and remove supernatant
Resuspend pellet in 200ul LB
Plate 100-200ul cells onto selection plates
If high efficiency is expected, we suggest plating a lower volume
If the expected efficiency is unknown, we suggest also plating a 1:10 dilution
Once dry, turn upside down (agar on top) and incubate overnight @ 37°C
* The optimal time depends on the cells
