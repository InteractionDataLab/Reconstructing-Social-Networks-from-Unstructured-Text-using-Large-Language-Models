Notes:
Keep reaction tubes and Ligase on ice at all times
ng of DNA will vary depending on length ratios
Ligation set-up
Mix the following
Add Ligase last
For help calculating DNA ratios, use the NEBioCalculator
Reagent
Amount
10x Ligase Buffer
2 ul
Vector DNA (4kb)
50 ng
Insert DNA (1kb)
37.5 ng
Water
to 20 ul
T4 Ligase
1 ul
Mix gently by pipetting. Spin briefly
Incubate (options are for sticky ends)
Option 1: incubate at 16C overnight (8-12 hours)
Option 2: incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
