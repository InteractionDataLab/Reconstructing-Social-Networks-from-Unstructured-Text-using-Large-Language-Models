Tricks on making plates
Do not autoclave antibiotics or other heat sensitive ingredients
Let autoclaved media cool first
For variety of selection plates, divide media into 50 mL conicals
Add antibiotics to conicals, mix, then pour
Amounts
500 mL makes slightly less than 1 sleeve
50 mL makes 2 thick plates
Media can be autoclaved then let sit to harden for latter use
Microwave (on low) until completely melted
Recommended to use conical method
Otherwise, pour ONLY into sterile containers
Adding antibiotics
Do not autoclave antibiotics
If making liquid media, antibiotics can be added at any point after the media cools.
If making plates, let media cool on a stir plate. Once cool enough add antibiotic, let mix for 30-60 seconds then pour.
Informal trick: It is about cool enough when you can hold your hand to the flask for 5 seconds (but obviously, donâ€™t burn yourself)
