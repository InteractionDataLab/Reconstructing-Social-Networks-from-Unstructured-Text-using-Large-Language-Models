Composite Parts
BBa_K1718001:
RFP under arabinose inducible pBad
This part has a Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) downstream of the pBad promoter. Expression is stimulated by L-arabinose. We used this part to test the leakiness of this promoter.
BBa_K1718003:
RFP under the LuxPr promoter
In the presence of AHL, the LuxR transcription factor will bind AHL and activate the LuxPr promoter. RFP is downstream and will be expressed.
BBa_K1718004:
LuxI and GFP
LuxI leads to the production of AHL which, when in the presence of AHL, activates the LuxPr promoter. Downstream of the LuxI coding region is GFP, a reporter
BBa_K1718006:
Genetic switch for Bxb1 with LuxI and GFP
This part consists of the genetic switch described in BBa_K1718002 and the LuxI and GFP coding regions described in BBa_K1718004
