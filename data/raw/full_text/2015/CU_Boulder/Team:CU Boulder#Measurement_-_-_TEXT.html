Transform BioBrick parts using Transformation Protocol.
Confirm transformation
Fill culture tubes with 5 mL of LB and appropriate amount and type of antibiotic.
Pluck colonies from plates using 200 μL pipette tip and place in tubes, leave tubes in 37.5 ° shaking incubator on 250 rpm for 12-18 hours.
Retrieve overnight cultures from incubator and miniprep using Qiagen Miniprep Protocol
Digest miniprepped DNA using Spe1 and Pst1 restriction enzymes
Run a gel and image to validate construct.
Create construct.
Digest BBa_J232101 with SpeI and PstI at 37 °C for 60 minutes.
PCR I13504 with appropriate primers and digest using Xba1 and Pst1.
