Human Practices
Running a gel
Making the gel
Add 100mL of 1x TAE to a flask
Add 1g Agarose for a 1% gel
Add 2g for a 2% gel, etc.
A higher percent gel runs slower but has better resolution
Microwave for 60 s
Swirl
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until agarose is completely dissolved
Let cool
Add 5ul Ethidium Bromide
Preparing the gel
Check that open ends of tray are facing the sides of the gel box
Alternatively, tape the open ends
Put the comb(s) in place
Pour
If using a larger gel box, pour entire 100mL
If using a smaller gel box, pour 75mL or scale down the above amounts
Let gel solidify
Turn the gel so the comb is at the negative terminal
Remove comb
Fill gel box with 1X TAE. It should barely cover the gel
Running the gel
Mix loading dye and water with DNA as needed
Vortex and spin briefly
Load wells, careful to not let samples out of the well
Don't forget the ladder!
Plug in and run
Smaller gels don't need as high of dosage
At a lower voltage, the samples move slower but the separation is more clear
