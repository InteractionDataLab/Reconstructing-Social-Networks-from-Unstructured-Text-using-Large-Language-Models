Making chemically competent cells
Day 1
Grow cells overnight (8-12 hours)
Day 2
Before starting
Set centrifuge to 4C
MgCl2 and CaCl2 solutions
Take DMSO out of freezer to thaw
Chill microtubes
Prepare cells
Add 0.5mL of the overnight to 50mL LB
Grow until culture is between an OD of 0.2 and 0.4 (check after 1.5hr)
Ice for 30 minutes
Centrifuge 2700g for 10 minutes at 4C
Decant. Dry on paper towel for 1 minute
Completely resuspend in 30mL 0.8M MgCl2, 0.2M CaCl2
Gently vortex
Centrifuge
Decant. Dry on paper towel for 1 minute
Fully resuspend in 2mL of 0.1M CaCl2
Â Add 70ul DMSO while tube is on ice
Swirl to mix
Ice for 15 minutes
Add 70ul DMSO, swirl to mix
Dispense 200ul of cells into prechilled microtubes
Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen
Store at -80c
Recommended: Test for efficiency and test for contaminants
