Students
Michael Donovan
Major/minor: Biochemistry and Neuroscience
I worked on the Interlab Measurement project as well as constructs involving luxI, GFP, and the genetic logic gate.
Josephina Hendrix
Major/minor: Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, with minors in Biochem and Computer Science
At the computer I coded the wiki. In the lab, I provided advice and occasional cloning assistance.
Naomi Iverson
Major/minor: Chemical and Biological Engineering with a minor in Computer Science
Involved with pBad+RFP assembly to test pBad promoter, LuxI biobricking and LuxI + RFP assembly.
Daren Kraft
Major/minor: Biochem and Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology
I worked on project design, refinement of integrase and target promoter, along with various aspects of the cloning process.
Cameron Whiteside
Major/minor: I'm a senior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering.
For this project, l contributed to the outreach portion by investigating practical applications of the product and conducting interviews with potential users.
Hannah Young
Major/minor: Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology & Neuroscience
I worked with constructs involving LuxR and with testing the LuxPr promoter.
Advisers
Robin Dowell
Previous involvement: I founded the CU team in 2012.  Attended iGEM as a spectator at MIT from 2006-2008.
I've got degrees in computer engineering, genetics, computer science, and biomedical engineering.  So the teamwork, design, and innovation of iGEM is always fun.   I also enjoy working with undergraduates.
Marcelo Bassalo
Previous involvement: I was part of iGEM in 2009 as an undergrad student, being part of the first brazilian team to participate in this competition.
iGEM is a perfect introduction to the promising field of synthetic biology, with hundreds of creative ideas being exchanged in this fun competition.
Michael Brasino
Previous involvement: I have been an adviser to iGEM for the last two years and a iGEM student in the past at University of Washington.
I like iGEM because it allows students to move research in completely new directions.
Peter Otoupal
Previous involvement: In 2012 I helped revive iGEM at The University of Texas, Austin, where we engineered E. coli to be "addicted" to caffeine for survival.
iGEM is one of the best programs to introduce the next-generation of scientists to Synthetic Biology. By creating and pursuing their own projects, students in iGEM get a glimpse into what it research really entails.
