This is a method to determine relative fluorescence by eye
We recommend arabinose concentrations of 0% to 0.2%, increasing in 0.04% increments
Day 1
Set up overnights
Add appropriate antibiotics
Add arabinose in increasing amounts
Let cells grow for at least 12 hours
Day 2
Spin cells down for 3 minutes at 8,000x g
Decant
Order tubes in order of arabinose concentration
Compare the fluorescence by eye
