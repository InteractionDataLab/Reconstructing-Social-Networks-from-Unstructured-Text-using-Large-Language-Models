BBa_K1718002:
Genetic Switch for Bxb1 invertase
The Bxb1 invertase will invert the segment of DNA between the two recognition sites. In this case, Bxb1 will invert a terminator allowing for expression of a strong Anderson promoter.
Second Genetic Switch for Bxb1 invertase
We started work on a second switch. This switch contained a strong Anderson promoter in between the two Bxb1 recognition sites (attB and attP). We were unable to finish this part.
