Requirements for Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Partâ€™s Registry entry.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Your part must be different to the submission for Bronze medal criteria #6.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement , public policy issues, public perception or other activities.
