Abstract
Fracking is a common method for extracting natural gas and other fossil fuels from the ground, but it requires the use of many hazardous and carcinogenic compounds.  In Colorado, ground water contamination from fracking has endangered many communitiesâ€™ safe drinking water.  To address this environmental health issue, we developed a biosensor to detect naphthalene, a common reagent in fracking.  Naphthalene detection and output signal amplification can be achieved using the Lux promoter and the Bxb1 integrase. Our biosensor uses a naphthalene induced promoter located upstream of the BxB1 integrase.  Once expressed, Bxb1 acts on a logic gate to express RFP. A Lux cell-cell signaling system from V. fischeri will enable our system to be more sensitive at low concentrations. Our biosensor could be housed within a stake-shaped device, containing a pump to obtain ground water and a live culture box kept at homeostatic conditions.
