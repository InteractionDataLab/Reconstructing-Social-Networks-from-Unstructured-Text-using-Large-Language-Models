iGEM Academy
Nowadays, iGEM has a very strong and growing presence on YouTube with many videos being created and uploaded by teams each year.  iGEM Academy aims to bring together and unify the iGEM community on YouTube. We encourage fellow teams to either put together videos or contribute already existing videos that fall into the following categories:
Project Introductions: a platform for teams to share their project ideas, work done so far and goals for the future.
iGEM Tutorials: videos that provide visitors with up to date tutorials on synthetic biology and lab techniques that are relevant to synthetic biology. Our set of lab tutorials ‘A Beginner’s Guide’ has already been uploaded, make sure to check it out!
Lab Art: a showcase of the colourful and creative world of synthetic biology.
Musical iGEM: a celebration of song and dance in the lab.
Outside the Lab: videos outlining synthetic biology work being done outside of the competition.
iGEM HQ: videos about the iGEM competition and the Giant Jamboree.
Let’s Talk: video interviews with members of the public talking about synthetic biology.
WikiFlicks in collaboration with UCSF iGEM.
Taking part is easy and straightforward. The teams that already have an official YouTube channel can contribute videos that are already uploaded onto their own channel. With the teams’ permission, iGEM Academy will feature links that will send users directly to these videos.
However, if these teams would like to contribute videos that are not uploaded to their own channel or if an iGEM team doesn’t have an official YouTube channel but would still like to take part, these teams can be made managers of iGEM Academy. This will allow them to upload their videos directly to the channel.
It is important to point out that this is a joint effort. We hope that as many teams as possible take part in helping to make iGEM Academy a base which connects viewers with the YouTube channels and videos of all iGEM teams. So far we have had a very positive response from teams and some videos have already been uploaded to the iGEM Academy channel.
