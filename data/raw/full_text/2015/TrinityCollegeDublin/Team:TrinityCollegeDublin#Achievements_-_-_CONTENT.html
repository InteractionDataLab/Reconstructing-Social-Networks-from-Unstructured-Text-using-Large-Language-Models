These new parts have been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry.</LI><LI>We  have  carried  out  extensive  research  on  the  problem  of  malaria  in the developing world, that has constituted the whole of our Human Practices. It involved investigating various aspects of malaria starting with global health issues to artemisinin resistance and supply logistics of the drug. The outcomes of our research can be found on our Human Practices page. </LI><B>GOLD</B><UL><LI>With  malaria being such an enormous  problem  in  modern society,  new ideas  on how to eliminate  it  are  desired.  Our  project  proposes  a  different,  innovative  way  of  producing artemisinin that can be further enhanced in the future in order to identify the most efficient strategy to deal with malaria.</LI><LI>We have helped validate Basehunter System created by Cork iGEM Team 2015. The details can be found on our Collaboration-iGEM Cork page.</LI></UL><H2>Accomplishments</H2><LI>First iGEM team from Trinity College Dublin</LI><LI>Successful participation in Interlab Study</LI><LI>Launched our YouTube channel iGEM Academy which consisted of our own tutorials for general protocols. In addition, it also proved to be a great collaboration platform with over 20 different iGEM teams participating by uploading or linking their various videos to the channel.</LI><LI>Collaborated with Team Cork by testing out their Basehunter system and helped in validating it.</LI><LI>Designed and constructed a part to make dihydroartemisinic acid by using the DBR2 pathway in E.coli; a method that had never been investigated before.</LI><LI>Designed and constructed 17 parts and successfully submitted them to iGEM HQ.</LI><LI>Researched on various literature reviews to document information on Global Health, Malaria, artemisinin logistics, and the future of semi synthetic artemisinin, malaria control and synthetic biology.</LI><LI>Conducted in-depth interviews with notable people in the field of synthetic biology and Malaria treatment, such as Chris Paddon and Kathleen Monroe from Zagaya and Ingrid Chen from Malaria Elimination Initiative.</LI><LI>Did a qualitative analysis of possible relations between Gender inequality and Malaria. In  light  of  this  research,  we  gathered  quantitative  data  from  our  own  college  to investigate gender inequality issues in Science and Technology.</LI><LI>Ran a Synthetic Biology tutorial for children aged 8 to 12, where we shed light on DNA, genes, experimental genetics, and synthetic biology.</LI><LI>Carried out a survey amongst a diverse group of people across a wide age range to analyse their opinions on the ethics of synthetic biology and the issue of Malaria. </LI><LI>Created an innovative triangular design for our website.</LI><LI>Made a poster.</LI><LI>Created a presentation.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
