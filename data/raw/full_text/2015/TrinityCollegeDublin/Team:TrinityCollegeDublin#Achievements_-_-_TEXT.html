BRONZE
Our team has successfully registered for the Giant Jamboree, completed the Judging Form, wrote a short Project Description that was available on our front page and documented our parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Made a poster and will give a presentation at the Giant Jamboree.
Our attribution page contains all the required information on work  division  throughout  the summer, including  students,  supervisors, advisors and collaborators.
A full list of new Biobrick parts and devices submitted to the iGEM Registry by our team this year can be found on our Parts page .
SILVER
Our  Biobrick  Parts  ALDH1  and  ALDH1-His  have  been  experimentally  validated  using GC-MS and they work as expected. These new parts have been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We  have  carried  out  extensive  research  on  the  problem  of  malaria  in the developing world, that has constituted the whole of our Human Practices. It involved investigating various aspects of malaria starting with global health issues to artemisinin resistance and supply logistics of the drug. The outcomes of our research can be found on our Human Practices page.
GOLD
With  malaria being such an enormous  problem  in  modern society,  new ideas  on how to eliminate  it  are  desired.  Our  project  proposes  a  different,  innovative  way  of  producing artemisinin that can be further enhanced in the future in order to identify the most efficient strategy to deal with malaria.
We have helped validate Basehunter System created by Cork iGEM Team 2015. The details can be found on our Collaboration-iGEM Cork page.
Accomplishments
First iGEM team from Trinity College Dublin
Successful participation in Interlab Study
Launched our YouTube channel iGEM Academy which consisted of our own tutorials for general protocols. In addition, it also proved to be a great collaboration platform with over 20 different iGEM teams participating by uploading or linking their various videos to the channel.
Collaborated with Team Cork by testing out their Basehunter system and helped in validating it.
Designed and constructed a part to make dihydroartemisinic acid by using the DBR2 pathway in E.coli; a method that had never been investigated before.
Designed and constructed 17 parts and successfully submitted them to iGEM HQ.
Researched on various literature reviews to document information on Global Health, Malaria, artemisinin logistics, and the future of semi synthetic artemisinin, malaria control and synthetic biology.
Conducted in-depth interviews with notable people in the field of synthetic biology and Malaria treatment, such as Chris Paddon and Kathleen Monroe from Zagaya and Ingrid Chen from Malaria Elimination Initiative.
Did a qualitative analysis of possible relations between Gender inequality and Malaria. In  light  of  this  research,  we  gathered  quantitative  data  from  our  own  college  to investigate gender inequality issues in Science and Technology.
Ran a Synthetic Biology tutorial for children aged 8 to 12, where we shed light on DNA, genes, experimental genetics, and synthetic biology.
Carried out a survey amongst a diverse group of people across a wide age range to analyse their opinions on the ethics of synthetic biology and the issue of Malaria.
Created an innovative triangular design for our website.
Made a poster.
Created a presentation.
