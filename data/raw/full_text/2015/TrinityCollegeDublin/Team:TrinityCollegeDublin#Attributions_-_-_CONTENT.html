Trinity College Dublin iGEM 2015 team would like to thank everyone involved in our project. Contributions might have been bigger or smaller, nonetheless without your help none of what we have achieved would have been possible. 

Loud applause for our supervisors <B>Matthew Carrigan</B> and <B>Killian Hanlon</B> who despite their own work on the 3rd floor of Smurfit Institute found time to teach us basic and more advanced laboratory techniques, advised us on safety procedures, and assisted us in designing our DNA constructs throughout the course of summer. Your sharing of experience proved to be extremely helpful and provided us with the necessary knowledge that enabled us to start off work on our own in a separate laboratory.   
 
Our Academic Supervisor, <B>Prof. Mani Ramaswami</B>, Research Professor of Neuroscience in Genetics Department at Trinity College Dublin for help in administrative aspects of our project. <B>Mr. Barry Moran</B>, the Manager of the <A href="https://www.tcd.ie/Biochemistry/research/resources/flow/">Flow Cytometry Facility</A>in the School of Biochemistry and Immunology who provided us with useful background information on flow cytometry technique as well as helped process data for Interlab Study.<B>Amyris</B> for providing us with the artemisinic acid producing cell lines B569 to conduct our research. <B>Integrated DNA Technologies</B> for sponsored synthesis of the biobrick parts. <B>Vanya Eccles</B> for narrating the tutorial videos on the iGEM Academy Youtube channel. 
 

Special thanks to the people who agreed and found time to talk to us about the problem of malaria in the developing world. Their insight contributed greatly to our Human Practices work: 

Interviewees <B>Chris Paddon</B> from Amyris, <B>Kathleen Monroe</B> from <B>Zagaya</B>, <B>Ingrid Chen</B> from <B>Malaria Elimination Initiative</B>
 
Lab technicians, <B>Lorraine and Tracy</B>, for providing basic materials and equipment necessary to conduct our wet lab work <B>Leona and Clodagh</B> from the <A href="https://www.tcd.ie/Biochemistry/research/resources/flow/">CMA</A>for helping with GC/MS. <H3>Thank you all for making this summer an enjoyable learning experience!</H3><H2>STUDENTS CONTRIBUTIONS</H2><B>Anya Aleshko</B><UL><LI>Involved in making the videos for iGEM Academy.</LI><LI>Editing of Human Practices and writing on the ‘future’.</LI><LI>General help around the wet lab.   </LI><LI>Writing up on iGEM Academy for the wiki as well as for the newsletter.  </LI><LI>Writing up about the Cork Meet up.</LI><LI>Contributed to designing the poster and preparing presentation. </LI></UL><B>Arnas Petrauskas</B><UL><LI>Involved in making T7 Polymerase positive XL1-Blue cell line.  </LI><LI>Aldh1 expression and &quot;Alpha&quot;
