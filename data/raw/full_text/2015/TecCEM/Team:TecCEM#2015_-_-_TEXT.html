January
Week 1 and 2: the team selected five Project proposals to further develop. The team was subdivided in teams to do research and presentations.
Week 3: The team discarded two projects and analised the feasability and impact of three project proposals.
28th: The team finally selected a the DNAbot as the Project to be developed for the competition.
31st: The team presented the Project objectives to the Faculty College of the Biotechnology and Chemical Engineering Faculty of ITESM CEM.
