As a part of the Interlab Measurement Study held by iGEM during 2015 competition, the TecCEM team worked throughout the summer with three different constructs that used a GFP reporter gene. The analysis intended to make a comparison of gene expression involving three different promoters, and the strength of expression of each one was measured using a fluorescence study.

Each device, comprised by a variable promoter,  and a mutant GFP biobrick, was cloned in the pSC1B3 high-copy number plasmid backbone. The three promoters were submitted by the iGEM Berkley Team in 2006 as part of a family of constitutive promoters under the part numbers through J23100 to J23119 (1); J23101, J23106, and J23117 were made biobrick compatible for this year’s competition. The GFP briobrick, named I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015 ), is formed of a ribosomal binding site (RBS), the gene coding for mutant GFP, and a double terminator. The devices were assembled as follows: 

1)	J23101 + I13504, in pSB1C3 backbone. 

2)	J23106 + I13504, in pSB1C3 backbone.

3)	J23117 + I13504, in pSB1C3 backbone.

In order to measure the relative efficiency of the promoters, the study required a protocol based upon the fluorescence properties of GFP. The relative fluorescence was measured and compared in order to conclude upon efficiency of the devices. Each device’s data was measured in triplicate, both biological and technical. It is also important to mention that this study was carried out using E. coli DH5α.
