Central  Memorial,  is  a  senior  high  school  located  in  Southwest  Calgary,  Alberta,   Canada with a vast array of personality in it’s 1,120 students. Known for the Performing   and  Visual  Arts  (PVA)  program,  it  is  a  central  hub  where  students  come  from  all   quadrants of the city to share their talents, and work to pursue their passions. PVA, an   auditioned  program,  has  four  disciplines.  PVA  Music  is  the  largest  disciple,  and   encompasses  a  large  symphonic  band,  an  award  winning  chamber  choir,  and  a   stunning strings ensemble, a program unique to Central. PVA Theatre Arts provides a   professional  experience  to  students  interested  in  theatrical  performance,  working   frequently  with  professionals  in  the  field  who  share  knowledge  in  genres  such  as   improvisation,  film  acting,  and  everything  in  between.  PVA  Theatre  Arts  also  has  a   phenomenal technical theatre program, for students wishing to specialize in the behind   the scenes aspects of theatre. PVA Dance provides instruction in a wide array of dance   styles, ranging from  classical ballet to  contemporary hip­hop. Lastly, PVA Art teaches   young artists to work with a variety of mediums, providing a robust artistic education in   both ceramic and visual art.   Although  generally well  known  for  the  arts, Central  Memorial  is also one of  the  three   homes  to  the  National  Sports  Academy  (NSA),  with  specification  in  Baseball,   FlexSports  (individual  sports),  Golf,  Hockey,  Lacrosse,  and  Soccer.  To  match  their   highly  academic  students,  Central  has  a  strong  core  academic  program,  offering   advanced  placement  in  many  of  the  courses  offered,  as  well  as  a  wide  array  of   extracurricular clubs. This is the second year that Central Memorial has an iGEM team.   We are out to prove that artists can make great scientists too.
Meet The Team
Vladimir has been living in Calgary since day one. Growing up, he has experienced and  explored everything from the bike paths in Fish Creek to the top of the Bow. At the age of  eight, Vladimir developed a passion of photography and film­making, and carries it with him  to this day. If he is not capturing photos, or studying, you can most likely find him zipping  around from city to city on his bike. His passion for iGEM developed within the first weeks of  grade ten, and carries into many aspects of his life. From lab work to media, Vladimir does it  all.
Natalie is a grade twelve student in Central's Performing and Visual Arts program in the dramatic arts discipline. She has always had  a passion for the arts, having done private voice lessons from ages 8-16 as well as being involved in several choirs including Central Memorial's concert choir. Natalie, although always very academic, became extremely fascinated with human biology throughout high school. She worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Marie Fraser at the University of Calgary during summer of 2015, work in on a biomedical research project with future application in dislipodemia and cancer treatment.  Her future aspirations are to study Life Sciences or Health Sciences and one day become a perfusionist.
Kevin Klemmer is the supervisor of the Central iGEM Team. He has taught at Central Memorial Highschool for 15 years.
Jared was once a no life, that is, until he joined IGEM -- of which then, he became a no life that does science. If he isn't in the lab, then in all likelihood, he would be attempting to learn idioms, reading papers, doing math, memorizing the quadratic formula, and devouring ice cream.
Francis Routledge is a grade twelve student who is a hard­working academic student that is  passionate about the sciences. She was initially interested in iGEM because of the amounts  of opportunity that iGEM presented. Francis is actively involved in her school community and  is a leader in many clubs and activities within her school. Outside and inside school, she  plays badminton and is on her schools’ cross country, track, badminton, field hockey, and  basketball teams. Francis is passionate about athletics, academics, and music. In the future, she would like to pursue a career in medicine.
Alexia Gendron is a simple 12th grader who spends her spare time perfecting recipes and playing piano. She enjoys reading, volunteering, good soup, Italian, and having insightful conversations. Although born in Calgary, Alberta, she was brought up in French, and attended a francophone school until her 10th grade. This has given her exposure to French-Canadian culture and taught her where to find it even if she finds herself a few provinces away from its origin. For five years she took karate and developed quite a fondness for martial arts. Despite having had to stop karate this year, she plans on starting to practice judo as soon as possible. After discovering Ronda Rousey, she found the very first person ever to move her so strongly, and she considers Rousey to be an inspiration. Right now, Alexia is focusing on the present, and is trying to enjoy her final year of high school before she graduates. Although she plans on attending university next year, she has yet to figure out exactly what she wants to study. She has always loved to learn all there is to learn and do all there is to do; she hopes to travel the world someday, meet fantastical people, and have a great collection of jaw-dropping stories to tell.
Jessica Skall is a grade 12 student at Central Memorial Highschool. She recently moved to Calgary from Toronto, and she felt that iGem would be a good place to make friends with common interests in science. Long team plans of hers include becoming an international ESL teacher. That is all
My name is Danielle and I am currently a grade 12 student at Central Memorial High School. At central, I am a part of the Performing Visual Arts program for dance. I do many genres of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet, lyrical, hip hop, and more. It takes up most of my free time. I am also a co-captain of the cheerleading team, and a member of the iGem team. Being a part of iGem is a great experience! In the future, I aspire to be a doctor, and this is why I am a member of the iGem team. IGem has broadened my knowledge and will potentially help me in fulfilling my career goals.
