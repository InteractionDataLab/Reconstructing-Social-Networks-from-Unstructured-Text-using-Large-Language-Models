Part Documentation
We submitted a part, Angiostatin, BBa_K1821000, to the registry.
The DNA for this protein was modified to only use the first three Kringles of the human plasminogen. because the most effective inhibition of endothelial cell growth occurs in  these Kringles.  It was also modified it to prevent glycosylation so that the protein would not be destroyed when secreted into a mammal.

The entire angiostatin protein is from amino acid 79-466:

Characterization of a Part
We worked really hard at characterizing pLac, BBa_K822000.  Our team ran several assays with our pLac -Angiostatin construct.  We altered our media and tried several different concentrations of lactic acid.  We also enlisted the assistance of our mentors, David Lloyd and Iain George.  They came up with several different suggestions as to what might be stopping our assays from working.  We worked on implementing them but still could not get our assays to work.
