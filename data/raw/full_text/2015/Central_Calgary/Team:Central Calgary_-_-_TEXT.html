Central iGEM
Central Memorial, is a senior high school located in Southwest Calgary, Alberta, Canada with a vast array of personality in itâ€™s 1,120 students. Known for the Performing and Visual Arts (PVA) program, it is a central hub where students come from all quadrants of the city to share their talents, and work to pursue their passions. PVA, an auditioned program, has four disciplines. PVA Music is the largest discipline, and encompasses a large symphonic band, an award winning chamber choir, and a stunning strings ensemble, a program unique to Central. PVA Theatre Arts provides a professional experience to students interested in theatrical performance, working frequently with professionals in the field who share knowledge in genres such as improvisation, film acting, and everything in between. PVA Theatre Arts also has a phenomenal technical theatre program, for students wishing to specialize in the behind the scenes aspects of theatre. PVA Dance provides instruction in a wide array of dance styles, ranging from classical ballet to contemporary hip-hop. Lastly, PVA Art teaches young artists to work with a variety of mediums, providing a robust artistic education in both ceramic and visual art.
Although generally well known for the arts, Central Memorial is also one of the three homes to the National Sports Academy (NSA), with specification in  Baseball, FlexSports (individual sports), Golf, Hockey, Lacrosse, and Soccer.  To match their highly academic students, Central has a strong core academic program, offering advanced placement in many of the courses offered, as well as a wide array of extracurricular clubs. This is the second year that Central Memorial has an iGEM team. We are out to prove that artists can make great scientists too.
