Collaborations
At the end of February, in 2015, we participated in a mentorship weekend with the University of Lethbridge and several other high school teams from Alberta.  We travelled down to the University of Lethbridge in order to improve our laboratory techniques and procedures.  Several of the University of Lethbridge team members worked with all of our team members, teaching us basic lab techniques, and advanced lab techniques.  Our team came away from the weekend much better equipped to use proper methods in our lab.
We also collaborated with the Ted Harrison middle school team during their first year as an iGEM team.
