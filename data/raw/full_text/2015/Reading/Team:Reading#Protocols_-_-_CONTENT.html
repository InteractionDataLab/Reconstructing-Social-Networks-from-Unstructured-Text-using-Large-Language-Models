The references at the bottom of the page provide the sources for the protocols, however we have modified several of them to our needs.</P><P><TITLE2>Growth of <I>Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</I></TITLE2><OL><LI>Thaw stock of 6803 on ice</LI><LI>100ml of BG-11 medium added to sterile conical flask aseptically</LI><LI>Add 10µl or 5 loopfuls of 6803 to flask</LI><LI>Incubate at ~30°C and on shaker at ~58rpm, under constant illumination</LI><LI>Check growth each day by measuring OD<SUB>750</SUB></LI></OL></P><P><TITLE2>Taking optical density of culture to measure growth</TITLE2>
We measured the OD<SUB>750</SUB> to match that used in research papers on <I>Synechocystis</I><SUP>1</SUP>.
<OL><LI>Set spectrophotometer to measure at OD<SUB>750</SUB></LI><LI>Blank with 1ml of BG-11</LI><LI>Take OD<SUB>750</SUB> of 1ml of culture</LI><LI>If OD<SUB>750</SUB> over 1 a.u, dilute 250µl of culture in 750µl of BG-11 (1/4 dilution)</LI></OL>
To calculate cell density, we used the equation,
1 a.u = 1.6x10<SUP>8</SUP> cells per ml of culture<SUP>2</SUP>.
</P><P><TITLE2>Solar water disinfection (SODIS)</TITLE2>
SODIS is an extremely cheap and simple method of sterilising water, requiring only sunlight, and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles<SUP>3</SUP>. We used water from <A href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Whiteknights+Lake,+University+of+Reading,+Earley,+Reading,+Wokingham/@51.4416726,-0.9404284,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487684b3ea7ada4f:0x487684b3f9714909">Whiteknights lake</A>on the University of Reading campus.
<OL><LI>Pass water through a filter into a PET bottle to remove particulates</LI><LI>Seal bottle and place in sunlight. Leave bottle exposed to intense sunlight for a minimum of 6 hours</LI></OL></P><P><TITLE2>Miniprep: Isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria</TITLE2>
We used the Thermo Scientific GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit<SUP>4</SUP> for our miniprep. This protocol closely follows protocol A, which is detailed in the booklet included in the kit.
<OL><LI>Pellet cells from 1.5ml of culture by centrifugation at 4000rpm for 2 minutes, and remove as much supernatant as possible and discard, leaving only the pellet.</LI><LI>Resuspend pellet in 250µl of Resuspension Solution by vortexing breifly until pellet no longer visable.</LI><LI>Lyse cells by adding 250µl of Lysis Solution and mixing thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until solution becomes viscous and clear</LI><LI>Add 350µl of Neutralisation Solution and mix immediately and gently until solution becomes cloudy.</LI><LI>Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 12,000rpm</LI><LI>Transfer supernatant to a GeneJET spin column. Avoid disturbing white precipitate.</LI><LI>Centrifuge for 1 minute at 12,000rpm and discard the flow-through.</LI><LI>Add 500µl of Wash Solution to GeneJET spin column, centrifuge for 1 minute at 12,000rpm, and discard flow-through.</LI><LI>Repeat step 8.</LI><LI>Discard flow-through and centrifuge for 1 minute at 12,000rpm to remove residual Wash Solution.</LI><LI>Transfer GeneJET spin column to a fresh 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 50µl of Elution Buffer, being careful not to touch the membrane with the pipette.</LI><LI>Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes and then centrifuge for 2 minutes at 12,000rpm</LI><LI>Discard GeneJET spin column and store purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.</LI></OL></P><P><TITLE2>BG-11 Agar plates</TITLE2></P><P>BG-11 plates are used to grow <I>Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</I> strains.

Wrap this in aluminium foil to block out light.</LI><LI>The cells are then pelleted at 14000g for 5 minutes. The cells are then resuspended in 2.4ml of BG-11 and then filled to 3ml without adding the Potassium Ferricyanide. </LI></OL><OL><LI>Resuspend in 2.4ml of BG-11 and add 3µl of Potassium Ferricyanide and fill to 3ml of BG-11.</LI><LI>To a fresh cuvette 1ml of sample is added and then placed in the spectrophotometer and the value is recorded at a wavelength of 420nm</LI><LI>This is repeated at 680nm and 750nm using a fresh sample each time and zeroing the sample prior to use.</LI><LI>The data is measured four times over 9.30am, 1230pm, 2.30pm and 5.30pm.</LI><LI>Ferricyanide concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 420 nm of the supernatant (1 Au = 1 mM).</LI><LI>Used to determine rate of ferricyanide reduction in pmol [Fe(CN)6]3− min−1.</LI></OL><TITLE2>Revised Ferricyanide protocol- TW-L</TITLE2><OL><LI>Harvest cells from log phase (0.4 - 0.6 a.u)</LI><LI>Centrifuge the cells to produce supernatant by centrifugation at 1800g/4725rpm using a low speed centrifuge for a few seconds.</LI><LI>Dispose of supernatant, leaving behind a dark green pellet</LI><LI>Add 2ml of potassium ferricyanide </LI><LI>4 measurements every 2 hours at least</LI><LI>Ferricyanide concentrations calculated from abs of 420nm of the supernatent (1abs = 1 mM)</LI>
