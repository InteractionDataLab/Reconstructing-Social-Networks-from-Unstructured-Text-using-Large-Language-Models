Data
Here we display our raw data and any graphs from experiments and lab work. Dates are in the format DD/MM/YY. 6803 refers to the cyanobacterium used - Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

This table displays absorbance data used to measure the growth of wild type 6803 in flask 5, cultured on 07/07/15. Flask incubated at 30Â°C at 58rpm on a shaker. note: the reading on the 14/07 is considered anomalous, as it does not fit the trend of the rest of the data, and will subsequently be left out of graphs drawn from this data.
Cell count per ml estimated by using the relationship, 1 a.u. = 1.6x108cells per ml.

SODIS Table. This was discontinued after it was shown that the cells were not growing, consequently was assumed to be contaminated.
