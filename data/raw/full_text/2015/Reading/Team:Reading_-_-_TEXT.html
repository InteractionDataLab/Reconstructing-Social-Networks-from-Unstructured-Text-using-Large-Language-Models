University of Reading - iGEM 2015
This year, the Reading team plans to expand on last year's work and produce a more efficient, safe, and easy to maintain biological photovoltaic (BPV). We will be using and modifying the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a renewable source of cheap electricity in a photovoltaic cell.
We aim to redirect electron flow by removing electron sinks in the metabolism of Synechocystis, and to increase the  output of electrons from the cell to the electrodes by inducing hyperpilation in the bacteria.
