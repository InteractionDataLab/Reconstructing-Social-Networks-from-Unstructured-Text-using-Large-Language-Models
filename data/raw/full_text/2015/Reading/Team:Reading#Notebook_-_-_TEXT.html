Lab notes
This page is an account of the daily events in our lab and project. Dates are in the UK format DD/MM/YY. 6803 refers to the cyanobacterium used - Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
29/06/15
Cultured a sterile 500ml conical flask using 100 ml BG-11 and 5 loopfuls of 6803 Wild Type (WT). (Flask 1)
Cultured 5 streak plates of 6803 WT on BG-11 Agar
All placed on the windowsill in our lab under natural light and at room temperature (~25°C)
02/07/15
Three new sterile 500ml conical flasks set up on the shaker at 58rpm and 30°C. Each contains 5 loopfuls of 6803 WT and 100ml of BG-11. They are exposed to the overhead lights in the lab 24/7. (Flasks 2, 3, 4)
07/07/15
Flask 5 cultured containing 10ul 6803 WT in 100ml BG-11. This flask will be used for preliminary growth curve measurements. The flask was placed on the shaker with flasks 2,3 and 4 all at 58rpm and 30°C under lab overhead lights.
10/07/15
2 Litres of water collected from Whiteknights Lake on campus for SODIS, method outlines in protocols.
13/07/15
Estimating the Cells per ml for the flask from 29/06 1 a.u at 750nm = 1.6x108
OD750 = 0.028
Therefore
0.028x1.6x108 = 4.48x106 cells per ml
OD750 measurement and cells per ml estimated for flasks cultured on 02/07
14/07/15
The lamp safety testing completed so flasks placed under the bright white light bulb
21/07/15
Flasks are getting very green, definitely a good sign!
23/07/15
Flask 2 discarded as it is not showing growth, and has signs of contamination. We received most of the lab equipment we have ordered.
27/07/15
BG-11 order arrived finally!
Miniprep of plasmid DNA: We carried out extraction of biobrick construct plasmids from E.coli NEB-5α glycerol stocks.
We extracted pSB1K3 plasmid backbones combined with biobricks containing the following genes:
PilA1
PsaD
PetF
PilT
This gave us 4 samples of plasmid DNA, which were placed in the freezer at -20°C.
BG-11 cultures: We added ~200ml of BG-11 to two sterile 500ml conical flasks. We inoculated them as follows;
Flask 5 - 1ml of Wild type 6803 from flask 3 as this flask had the best growth.
Flask 6 - 10µl of stock Howe Lab triple mutant 6803.
SODIS lakewater cultures: We added ~200ml of SODIS lakewater to three sterile 500ml conical flasks. We inoculated them as follows;
SODIS 1 and 2 - 1ml of Wild type 6803 from flask 3 as this flask had the best growth.
SODIS 3 - 1ml of stock Howe Lab triple mutant 6803.
All flasks cultured today were placed in the incubator, being shaken at 58rpm, 30°C, and under bright white light
05/08/15
200ml of BG-11 was added to flasks 3 and 4 which already contained ~100ml of ~2 a.u density 6803 WT.
Competition Assay
200ml of BG-11 added to a new sterile conical flask
added 10ul of WT 6803 and 10ul of MT3 6803
Flask was placed in the incubator, being shaken at 58rpm, 30°C, and under bright white light
06/08/15
DNA concentration from miniprep
PilA1 = 11.16ns/ul
PsaD = 13.01ns/ul
PetF = 0.38ns/ul
PilT = 8.58ns/ul
*no DNA due to miniprep from Glycerol Stock
07/08/15
Made LB Agar tranplates for culturing
PilA1
PsaD
PetF
PilT
10/08/15
No growth on plates from 07/08
Cultured plates of LB Agar from all stocks (glycerol stocks)
11/08/15
Growth on many the stocks from 10/08, replated onto LB kan 50 plates
12/08/15
Competition Assay had begun to turn a light green colour.
13/08/15
Stock growth onto LB kan 50 plates unsuccessful.
21/08/15
Potassium ferricyanide reagent arrives, protocols start being drawn up
22/08/15
Nanowires concluded to be a non-fruitful venture
24/08/15
Reculturing flasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 into repeat flasks respectively
26/08/15
Our lab becomes engulfed in the tides of cuvettes arriving
27/08/15
Unsuccessful ferricyanide assay, protocol will be revised
28/08/15
Competition assay starting to reach log phase
31/08/15
LB BG-11 Kan plates and LB BG-11 plates made up to plate the competition assay on
01/09/15
Competition assay plated and growth will be monitored
02/09/15
Starting to prepare poster and presentation for the UK iGEM meet up hosted by Westminster
04/09/15
Enjoyed a fun day presenting in Westminster and talking to the other teams
07/09/15
Another ferricyanide ran with a mildly improved protocol but still yielded inconclusive results
11/09/15
Ran a ferricyanide assay not to give comparable data but data which can be interpreted to give the correct concentrations of Potassium Ferricyanide used
14/09/15
A successful ferricyanide assay was run using a new and improved protocol #Winning
18/09/15
The fuel cell was assembled and we put in the Cyanobacteria to measure the voltage given seeing a vast improvement over last years project, and we lived happily ever after without iGEM.
