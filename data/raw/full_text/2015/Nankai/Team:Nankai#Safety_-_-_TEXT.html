GENERAL SAFETY
DEALING with bacteria is never a work without risk, and all our members are fully aware of this. We have done a lot of work on safety. These work mainly contain: 1)adequate training for every member who is going to participate in laboratory work; 2)consulting with directors to make sure our job is safe; 3)communication with local safety affair office; 4)All the organisms we use in our lab are safety level 1 organisms. We only operate on those bacteria in clean benches and all the waste contains microorganisms are sterilized before further dispose. During experiments we  rubber gloves, disposable masks and goggles if it is necessary.
SAFE TEAM MEMBERS ^-^
WE'RE highly aware that we ourselves are the most important forces to avoid all the possible risks, as well as the most possible devils to cause all the disasters. So we pay much much attention on relative training to ensure that our members know clearly what should do and what should not in laboratory.
SAFE DESIGN
PROJECT design is one of the most well-thought factors in our work. We have some members in our team whose work is specifically investigate the design made by those members who undertake laboratory works to make sure there is no obviously risky items. All those investigated design will be later sent to our instructor to be double checked.
SAFE LAB WORK
LAB WORK is the most most important part of safety, and we are strictly careful on this. Usually when we carry out our lab work, we will choose some members to inspect those carriers to make sure their work is safe.And all our waste are discarded safely, strictly followed stipulations of our school.
SAFE MATERIALS
THE BACTERIA we choose is a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain we isolated from fermented food. It's hard to directly operate on this Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain genetically. So first we constructed expression vectors in E. coli DH5alpha, demethylated the plasmids in E. coli GM110, and then used methylase extracted from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to methylated the plasmids. At last we transformed those functional plasmids into Bacillus. ALL THE ORGANISM we use in our lab are safety level 1 organisms. We only operate on those bacteria in clean benches and all the waste contains microorganisms are sterilized before further dispose. During experiments we  rubber gloves, disposable masks and goggles if it is necessary.
SAFETY is highly taken care of HERE!
We ONLY work in a tidy lab!
We are STRICT with our products!.
When working,we ALWAYS have someone to INSPECT!
