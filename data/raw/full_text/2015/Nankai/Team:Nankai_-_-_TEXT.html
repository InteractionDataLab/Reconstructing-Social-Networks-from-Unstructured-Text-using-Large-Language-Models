Welcome to Nankai IGEM Team!
From College of Life Sciences, Nankai University.
This autumn, we're coming!

This is our team!
Team Nankai 2015 is consist of 9 junior students, 11 senior students and 5 instructors. With our team established in March 2015, we are more than excited to join the big community of iGEM.
The idea of synthetic biology attracted us in a way that other fields of study never could, and our passion about science is the engine that has led us all the way through obstacles and setbacks. We are persevering and capable as a research team. However, at spare times, we are just a group of fun-loving young college students. There is always an atmosphere of anticipation that we could blend into iGEM community. So we are looking forward to seeing you at the Giant Jamboree! Want to know more about us? click here……
Do you know……?
What is “Pudding Health kit”? Pudding Health kit is actually a jelly-like unguent made of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) and wound healing medicines. It aims at mitigating prolonged inflammations during the process of tissue regeneration, and speeding up the healing process of chronic wounds like diabetic wounds.
What is Poly-γ-glutamic acid? Poly-γ-glutamic acid, i.e. γ-PGA, is an important, naturally occurring polyamide which exhibits excellent peculiarity in water retention and sustained drug release.  How is γ-PGA produced? We used engineered Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 for mass production of γ-PGA, yet the original B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 strain that we isolated from fermented food could only produce γ-PGA at a very low yield.

We use modeling in our project.
Although our project is promising and exciting, there are many difficulties when it comes to the practical fermentation. We need to consider lots of things before we can get our precious health pudding kit. For example, what culture medium should we use? How much carbon source should we add? How long should the fermentation process be? Well, we can hardly get what we want if it’s too short. On the other hand, a too long process is a waste of source and time, and you know, time means money in the industrial production. Most importantly, will our operation be harmful to the bacteria so that they can’t even survive? These are all we should take care of.
These practical questions are to be solved by our modeling. For details, click here.
Outside the lab……
As Peter Carr puts it, "Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work." This year, our team communicated with lots of teams and exchange our ideas.We also bravely showed our ideads on national confenrence.  We were in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang Provicnce and so on. Through communications, our team are growing and our ideas are spreading! Here for more information.
Our feature: iShare!
As we all know iGEM has already established a functional platform for participators to share Bio-bricks. However materials related to those Bio-bricks are still missing, like bacterial strains and expression vectors. It’s difficult to repeat previous iGEM projects and we want to make a difference by introducing iShare to all the iGEMers.
iShare as we pictured is the first step to all-round resource sharing platform. We suggest iGEM teams put information of materials used in their project on iShare and label those they are willing to share. In this way, future teams could have more resources for similar work and may come up with more improvement.Please see more information on iShare .
