Substrate scale
Substrate seems less important to the other two parts, since we provide abundant source. However, we can inspect the utility ratio of the sucrose, so that we can detect whether the substrate is well used. If not, there would be some problems in our operation. Besides, this can help to turn down the cost, which is really important in the industrial production.
