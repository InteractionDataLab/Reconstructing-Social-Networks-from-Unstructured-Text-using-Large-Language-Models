Nankai iShare
A brand new idea raised up by Nankai Team in 2014, iShare is an information-sharing platform aiming to converge all information of iGEM China teams involved in our experiment such as Topic, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Progression, Parts
PLASMID
All the information are as follows.

Can other teams get it from you
Ways to obtain it besides getting it from you
1
pHT01
A expression vector we used in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3
We purchased it from Mo Bi Tec(molecular biotechnology)
NCBI
Yes
Mo Bi Tec
2
pKSU
A temperature-sensitive vector used for gene deletion or insertion
We got this plasmid by adding upp expression cassette to plasmid pKSV7
The information of pKSV7 could be found on NCBI
Yes
