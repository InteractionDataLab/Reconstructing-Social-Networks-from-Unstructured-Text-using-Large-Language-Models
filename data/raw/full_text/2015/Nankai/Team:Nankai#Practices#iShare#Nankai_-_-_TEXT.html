Nankai Team Introduction
Nankai team was founded in Nankai University, March, 2015. We have expertise in many different fields ranging from genetics to product development and from physics to computer science. Throughout the project, we basically needed all of the special skills of each member to make our visions come true. The diverse set of skills made it possible to have a broad view on any problems.
Good attributions and collaborations make our team a skillful and hard-working group. Even while the team was divided to different subgroups who would focus on a certain part of the project, everyone got the chance to experience and learn something that they had never done before.
