Nankai iShare
A brand new idea raised up by Nankai Team in 2014, iShare is an information-sharing platform aiming to converge all information of iGEM China teams involved in our experiment such as Topic, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Progression, Parts
BACTERIA STRAIN
All the information are as follows.
