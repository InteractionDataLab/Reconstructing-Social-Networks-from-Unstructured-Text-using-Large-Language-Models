P1-GFP
Device
P3-GFP is a composite part used for the Measurement track of this year. This part consists of the promoter part of BBa_J23117, the official GFP device (with an RBS, GFP coding sequence and a set of double terminators) and a pSB1C3 backbone. We transformed this plasmid into E. coli cells and the fluorescence intensity of the GFP protein that was expressed by the bacteria was measured afterwards by a flow cytometry.

P2-GFP
Device
P2-GFP is a composite part used for the Measurement track of this year. This part consists of the promoter part of BBa_J23106, the official GFP device (with an RBS, GFP coding sequence and a set of double terminators) and a pSB1C3 backbone. We transformed this plasmid into E. coli cells and the fluorescence intensity of the GFP protein that was expressed by the bacteria was measured afterwards by a flow cytometry.
