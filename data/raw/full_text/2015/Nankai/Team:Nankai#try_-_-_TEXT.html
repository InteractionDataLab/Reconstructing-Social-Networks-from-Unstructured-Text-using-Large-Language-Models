Thank you for all your good work in creating theme. They have a ‘presence’ which feels right.
Thomas Teddy - Design Writer
I love the logo. Particularly how the mark can stand on its own. Nice work! It feels tall and proud and powerful — and I love that. That’s what I was after.
John Willy - Developer
You’re pretty awesome to work with. Incredibly organized, easy to communicate with, responsive with next iterations, and beautiful work.
