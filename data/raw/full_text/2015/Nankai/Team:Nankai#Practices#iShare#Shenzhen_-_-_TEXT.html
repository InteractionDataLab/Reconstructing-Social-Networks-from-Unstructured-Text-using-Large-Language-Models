SZU-iGEM  Team Introduction
Nowadays,Bladder cancer is one of the most urologic tumours in the world. However, the conventional therapy of cancer such as chemotherapy and radiation,have focused on mass cell killing without specific targeting and often cause side effects and frequent failures. Therefore,targeted and specific therapeutic strategy based on human cancer gene therapy turns out to be a promising approach to the treatment of bladder cancer.
Here we present the Synthesizing AND GATE genetic circuit based on UAA (Unnatural Amino Acid) and Orthogonal system that will detect and induce  the apoptosis of bladder cancer cell. The system encompasses two parts. One is the synthesizing gene circuit which only operates in bladder cancer cells that behaves as a logical AND gate on two input promoters.The AND gate activates an output that produces a cellular phenotype only when both promoters are capable of driving gene expression in the tested cell lines. Another part is to insert the synthesized unnatural amino acids in the bladder cancer cell to continue the protein translation at TAG(amber mutation) in order to activate the effectors. This methodology is based on the orthogonal system which enable the unnatural amino acids to generate protein without affecting other parts’ work. As a result, the output gene will hinder the tumour growth and induce apoptosis.
