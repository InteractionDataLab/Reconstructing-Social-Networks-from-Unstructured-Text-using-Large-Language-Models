Cunjiang Song
Prof. Cunjiang Song got B.S. Degree in 1983, from the Department of Biology, Northwest University in China, majoring in Microbiology. His Doctor of Engineering Degree was obtained in 2002, from the Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Toyama University, Japan, majoring in Life and Environmental Sciences. He established the Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Synthesis Laboratory in the College of Life Sciences, Nankai University. More than 80 papers were published in academic journals such as Scientific Reports, Metabolic Engineering, Applied Microl. Biotech., etc. 15 patents were granted. He is now a director of Chinese Society of Microbiology, as well as the general director of Tianjin Society of Microbiology.

The goal of our research is to understand the transcriptional program upon differentiation and reprogramming. A single cell, the zygote, can divide and differentiate into all types of cells in an organism. Even though the genetic information encoded in the genomic DNA is identical in the cells of the same organism, the readouts of the genetic information, namely transcriptional program, vary from cell to cell. Differential transcriptional programs lead to differential gene expression profiles, hence, different phenotypes and different cell fates. Transcription factors, epigenetic modification, microRNAs and signaling transduction pathways all contribute to the regulation of transcriptional program. We are interested in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotent cell differentiation, e.g. from ES cells to differentiated cells, or from the zygote to the blastocyst, and then to the cells of three germ layers. Recent studies showed that ectopic expression of few transcription factors can reverse differentiated somatic cells to an embryonic stage, namely induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). Due to their pluripotency and easy derivation without requirement for developing embryos, iPS cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine. We are eager to explore the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming. Meanwhile, we are developing new methods to derive iPS cells, which are suitable for clinical application.

Haosheng Shen
Hi there, my name is Haosheng Shen. Fun-loving, easy-going and smart is what my friends say about me. I love comic characters Green Arrow and Daredevil, and my favorite music band is Maroon 5. Besides, I am a crazy basketball fun of Chicago Bulls. Looking forward to meeting you on Giant Jamboree!
Fenghong Liu
Hi, my name is Fenghong Liu. Outgoing, lovely and confident is what my friends say about me. I have a fondness for travel, and I think travel means different experiences of pursuing of beauty. What’s more, whenever I see the beautiful scenery, I will take a photo as a memory. Looking forward to meeting you on Giant Jamboree!
Shuo Zhou
Shuo Zhou, an energetic and lusty member in Nankai iGEM team, concentrates on wiki page construction. What’s more, he is willing to introduce the latest information about Nankai. In his dictionary, nothing would become frustration forever. I believe you are abound to get along well with this optimistic and talkative friend!
Xiao Liu
Hello, everyone! I am Xiao Liu, a junior student from college of life sciences, Nankai University. This is my first time attending IGEM. I'm very glad to have this chance and meet you all there. This year, I'm in charge of the construction of wiki, and hope you like it. Though I major in life science, I'm also good at dealing with computer. I've gone to Japan and studied there for 5 months. It's the second time for me to go abroad, and that always makes me excited. Looking forward to the Giant Jamboree!
Xinhao Song
I am a member of the experiment division of the Nankai iGem Team 2015. I am mainly responsible for the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of plasmid parts. I love biology because I believe that every organism is literally a miniature of the universe for the fact that we all possess the heavy atoms produced by the ancient stars and the magnificent complexity of the whole cosmos.
Fankang Meng
Hi, I’m Fankang Meng, always a positive and optimistic guy. Sometimes I like to think about the basic questions such as the original of the universe, yep, really a crazy guy in philosophy and science. This year I mainly focus on Human Practice and Wiki construction. Looking forward to the Giant Jamboree! See you guys in Boston!
Fuhai Liu
Fuhai Liu, a sophomore student from life sciences college, Nankai University. He is in charge of the modeling part of this project. Besides, he also participates in the fermentation experiment to get what he needs for his modeling. Fuhai Liu is a responsible person who holds a positive attitude towards all difficulties in the life.
Xiaozhong Huang
I am Xiaozhong Huang, a junior student of Nankai University and iGEM 2015 Team, taking on experimental responsibility. Independence characterizes me and I like jogging so much that I squeeze time to practice even my summer schedule is full of labors. By the way, I am looking forward to opponents of iGEM as well as companions on running. It sounds fantastic that exploring Boston with our feet, isn’t it?
Mengxian Zhang
Hello everyone, my name is Mengxian Zhang. I am a positive and optimistic boy from Anhui province. Now I am in my sophomore year and my major is bioscience. I am very interested in synthetic biology. And I undertake the work of structuring the Wiki work. In daily life I have lots of hobbies like watching movies and playing billiards. Do you want to make a friend with me?
Yibing Wei
Hi, I'm Yibing Wei, 5'8 badminton fan, die-hard Gym rat who loves running and weight lifting. Music, physics and philosophy are the sparks of my life. A little kinky, but always friendly.
Yujie Zhao
Hi ,everyone !my name is Yujie Zhao ,the designer in Nankai iGEM Team 2015.In our team ,I’m responsible for the design of poster ,mascot , emblem ,wiki and so on .In leisure time ,reading and drawing are my favorite things ,because I can calm my mind .Besides I like  challenging myself and mastering something new ,like handwork ,doing experiment and subtitle movie l .The word 'impossible' is not in my dictionary.
Tianyi Huang
You’ll find me quite when I’m listening, excited when I find something funny. I like books, movies, and music, everything that can tell a good story. But the story I like best is the one I’ve been through with my lovely friends, so wish us good luck.  -- Tianyi Huang.
Zhaoran Zhang
I am a girl of various of interests and among them my favourites are music and travelling. I grew up in countryside and I liked to play around in the fields and observe all kinds of creatures especially plants. My love for botany built up in my childhood and now I have become an expert in plant taxonomy. It will be my lifelong career to explore the secret and beauty of life.
