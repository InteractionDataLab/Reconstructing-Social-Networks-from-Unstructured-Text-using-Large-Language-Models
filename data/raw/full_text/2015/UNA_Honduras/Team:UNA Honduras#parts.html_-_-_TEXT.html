Using the PDB data base (Protein Data Bank), we did search and analized our model protein, the best candidate for our design was Chitin Oligasaccharide Binding Protein, its characteristics are: It posses a firm structure, its a protein with only one polypepetide chain, therefore only requires one gene to be synthesized, it posses big exposed loops to insert epitopes (antigenic determinants) in from the Dengue virus, it is also a protein that E. coli bacteria exports from its cells, that would save us time and efforts in the laboratory tests, avoiding the destruction of the organism to recover it
 Model Protein (Chitin Oligasaccharide Binding Protein)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using this protein as a model  base and using software as : Pymol (To visualize the 3D structure of the protein and select the areas of interest), Serial Cloner (To insert the epitopes on the protein loops) and Swiss Model (To recreate the 3D model aproximately as how the protein would be folded when modified) We manage to create the 5 Proteins.
 One of the 5 Proteins created contains the epitopes (antigenic determinants) of the 4 serotypes of Dengue virus, to generate an immune response in the organism against the 4 Dengue types.
 Protein with the 4 Serotypes
 
  The other 4 proteins have each a different epitope, one for each of the 4 serotypes of the virus, making each one produces an immune response for only one serotype, that would be the epitopes of the serotype it contains.
 Protein with epitopes of Serotype 1
 
Protein with epitopes of Serotype 2
 
Protein with epitopes of Serotype 3
 
 
Protein with epitopes of Serotype 4
