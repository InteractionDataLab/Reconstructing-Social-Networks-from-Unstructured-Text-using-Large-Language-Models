MEDIA COVERAGE
An important part of IGEM UNAH´s project was          the support we had from the media. One of the group´s objectives was to spread          knowledge to people about Synthetic Biology and to let them know that Biology          students care about solving big scale problems that are affecting society,          through science. The media was an important part for this activity to take place and the team is very grateful.
Our first interactions with the public were          consequence of the search for funding for the project. In order to get this          funds the team decided to participate in the international contest “Global          Innovation through Science and Technology” (GIST) because in case of winning,          the team would have had training and funding for our project to take place. An          important part of this contest was to obtain the largest amount of votes          possible, so the team started spreading our participation throughout mass          media. The previously mentioned activity made us reach to different media in          the country and many of them had the will to collaborate with us.
The impulse obtained from our participation in          the contest was harnessed to keep spreading our project throughout mass media,          but with the intention of disseminate information and knowledge about Synthetic          Biology and the way our project was developing. Many media collaborated with          our team, some of them are well recognized nationally, and by this we can say          that our objective of disseminating was accomplished.
