Sobeida Nazaret Nuñez
I’m an undergraduate student          in Biology in the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). I love the          science and the nature; my principal attraction are the insects. But I’m          interesting in the Synthetic Biology because for me it is a field to solve          social and economic problems, that's why I like so much iGEM. And my free time,          I like reading, watching romantic movies, swimming and dancing.
Armando Romero
My name is Armando Romero, I`m 26          years old. I was born in Honduras, a country located in the heart of Central          America. I am a medicine student. Actually I am an intern in the last year of          my career. I love Medicine, Philosophy and Science.
 I love science because it is a way to          get near to the truth. It is one of the ways to discover the world and how it          works. The opportunity to participate in this investigation represents for me a          space to learn, learn about synthetic biology, the scientific method and how          others are walking in the same  path to help their comunities. 
Johan David Reyes
 I’m a student in Biology and          in the future I would like to study a Master degree in Botany and a Ph.D. on          Ficology. I like to play tenis,and guitar, Field colections, and watch a lot of          YouTube. My areas of interest are the Anatomic, Genetic and Fisiologic Research          on the Plantae Kingdom. Also, I am a Medical Biology Instructor at UNAH college          and like to talk in front of people just like my heroes, David Attenborough,          Carl Sagan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, George Carlin and others.
Currently I develop various          extracurricular proyects between them are Botanical taxonomic identificacions,          Floristic inventories and future research proyects, my birthday is Septembre 25th.
Juan          Jose Diaz
I'm studying the last year          of Microbiology in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras. This moment          I'm doing my thesis about artisanal cheeses in Honduras. I can't say more about          my investigation but If you want to know more about my thesis, you can write me          an e-mail.
I love everything about          Genetics and for that reason I'm a team member of iGEM UNA_Honduras. And my          hobbies are: going to cinema, listening to music and hanging out with my          friends.
Ricardo          Zavala
My name is Ricardo, I am a biology student at UNAH and          a proud member of the IGEM UNAH team. During my leisure time, I enjoy          practicing many kinds of sports, like football, basketball, and tennis. I am          also passionate about dancing, especially latin rythms like salsa and bachata,          and of course, I also have a geek side obsessed with videogames. I joined iGEM          unah as a way to acquire a new vision towards a brighter future, both for          myself and my country.
Juan David Sifontes
I’m studying Biology in the          UNAH. In a future I would like to study Molecular Biology or Genetics. I hope          to continue this project next year because I see future to help my country with          Synthetic Biology to resolve real problems what affect the population of my          country.
My hobbies are: playing the          guitar, listening to music and hanging out with my friends. My interesting          areas are: Zoology, Genetics and Biotechnology.
Eduin Castellanos
My name is Eduin Jose          Castellano Davila, I born 1994 in Tegucigalpa. I have many hobbies, for          example: Reading, listen to music, watch movies and TV programs (NCIS and CIS).          Now, I’m a student in Biology (3rd year) and I’m an iGEMer because I like to          investigate. Hope one day I will study a Master in Entomology.
