Synthetic Biology          is the branch of modern science in charge of creating molecules and organisms          that cannot be found in nature. This definition alone, implies a wide variety          of ethical issues when using synthetic biology. One of the biggest issues is          the uncertainty of risks and benefits derived from synthetic biology, since it          is a fairly new field of study. Synthetic biology is usually defined as          “Biological Engineering” achieving different objectives through various          techniques, including the induction of new therapies, currently in use to treat          incurable illnesses, new biological systems, and even genetic engineering          techniques.  A second ethical issue,          concerning almost every innovative new technology, takes place given the way          information is passed along and how people become aware (Murray, 2012).
Because          synthetic biology is such a fresh and new area of research, ethical issues grow          more and more every day. A wide range of positive and negative thoughts and          opinions are given about synthetic biology. According to Murray (2012),          synthetic biology has lots of advantages, it drives the development of many          other fields and inspires the participation of young adults in new research. An          example of the previous is the iGEM competition, inspiring teens around the          world and encouraging the development of new scientists. On the other hand,          synthetic biology critics, argue that it is impossible to assess the risks carried          by it, saying no strategy can be designed to soften the unknown consequences.
According to the Biosafety Committee in Spain          (2011), synthetic biology faces four large ethical aspects:
-       - The development of synthetic or          artificial life
-        -The scientist’s responsibility
-        -Biosafety norms within          Synthetic Biology
-        -Copyrights
First is the          development of artificial life. How will this affect society and its members?          How people will react according to their beliefs, traditions, and cultural          upbringing? In a world were synthetic organisms and natural organisms coexist,          biodiversity would no longer be preserved?. Instead, it would be limited in a          way that synthetic biology would participate and guarantee the species’          identity. By doing this, ideas would be reorganized, cons and pros would be          compared and boundaries would be set. To be necessary, prohibitions against the          development of these artificial organisms would also come into light (Biosafety          Committee of Spain, 2011).
A very important          universal human right is the right to freely begin a scientific investigation.          It is this same right which sets the boundaries to research. It is under the          scientist’s responsibility to stay within the morals and ethics established by          society.  This responsibility is rather          uncertain because it depends on the scientist’s environment, the time being, and          the circumstances taking place. It becomes especially sensitive when referring          to synthetic biology because it is a new field with future outcomes not yet          known. Telling between right and wrong will not always clear.
Synthetic Biology represents a new set of          potential risk factors for biosafety. Some of them include the use of it for          destructive goals like biological weapons, or any other synthetic creation with          destructive potential. Even though most of the work on synthetic biology is          done under laboratory safety conditions, the behavior of these synthetic          entities outside of the laboratory is uncertain.
The final ethical issue has to do with copyrights. There have always existed ethical issues due to copyrights and patents. These problems are predicted to be even bigger for synthetic biology. They are also, slightly, more complicated than the general structure of a copyright. Problems, concerning how to recognize a patent on a technological environment that blends various products and procedures already patentable as well as their interdisciplinary and interdependence, stand out (Biosafety Committee of Spain, 2011).
Synthetic          biology proves to possess a positive approach towards many areas of importance          in our society. Nevertheless, it deals with a wide range of ethical factors          that scientists focusing on these studies must be familiar with. No results can          be obtained without responsibility.
In Honduras, all          these issues are taken into consideration. Since Honduras has been through this          before, when introducing transgenic plants for crops, as a country, we know it          is important to incorporate an equal plan of activity for synthetic biology,          biotechnology and the traditional activity that has been going on for all these          years. The introduction of a new science takes a long time, especially in          developing countries. You first have to introduce the idea in society and into          the legal system of the country. This will allow new sciences and society coexist          in peace.
