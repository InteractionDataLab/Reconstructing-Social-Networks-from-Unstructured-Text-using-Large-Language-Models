Decoding Dengue Dynamics
Dengue fever is caused by the defensive reaction of          the body to the invasion of a virus transmmited by mosquito bite. Is a big          problem in developing countries and for over 70 years several attempts to          create an effective vaccines have failed; the way to prevent disease is to          control vectors: Aedes aegypti. There are at least 4 different virus serotypes          which prevalence shifts every year, patients who suffered one particular          serotype become immune for life, but getting another serotype, reaction is so          severe that dengue becomes hemorrhagic and lethal most of the times. We          designed synthetic proteins aimed to produce immunological response against          dengue. Using databases and for proteins, epitopes and 3D structures programs          we found epitopes for L and T white cells. Then selected a protein and inserted          on its chain these epitopes from all serotypes, and 4 proteins containing just          one serotype
