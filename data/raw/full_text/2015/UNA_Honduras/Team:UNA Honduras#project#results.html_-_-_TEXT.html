RESULTS
We expect as a succesful transformation, bacterial colonies showing the color put on the construction of the plasmid along with our designed protein, in this case RFP. We expect at least one of our designed proteins to be expressed by bacteria and then isolate some of it by electrophoresis means and test it against several sera from patients who have had dengue, this sera will include all 4 serotypes of the virus, we expect to see an aglutination reaction with the kind of serum from patients who had the serotype corresponding of the kind of proteins that could be expressed by the culture transformed with the correspondent designed gene.
Our Project is expected to cr√©ate 5 new species on the genus Escherichia, these are
E. carraccoi the species expressing the tetravalent protein; E. alduviniae, E. fontechae, E.sifontesii y E. espinozae, for the proteins against serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
