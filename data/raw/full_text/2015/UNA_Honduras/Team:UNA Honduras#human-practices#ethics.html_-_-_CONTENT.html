         is the branch of modern science in charge of creating molecules and organisms
         that cannot be found in nature. This definition alone, implies a wide variety
         of ethical issues when using synthetic biology. One of the biggest issues is
         the uncertainty of risks and benefits derived from synthetic biology, since it
         is a fairly new field of study. Synthetic biology is usually defined as
         “Biological Engineering” achieving different objectives through various
         techniques, including the induction of new therapies, currently in use to treat
         incurable illnesses, new biological systems, and even genetic engineering
         techniques.  A second ethical issue,
         concerning almost every innovative new technology, takes place given the way
         information is passed along and how people become aware (Murray, 2012).</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">Because
         synthetic biology is such a fresh and new area of research, ethical issues grow
         more and more every day. A wide range of positive and negative thoughts and
         opinions are given about synthetic biology. According to Murray (2012),
         synthetic biology has lots of advantages, it drives the development of many
         other fields and inspires the participation of young adults in new research. An
         example of the previous is the iGEM competition, inspiring teens around the
         world and encouraging the development of new scientists. On the other hand,
         synthetic biology critics, argue that it is impossible to assess the risks carried
         by it, saying no strategy can be designed to soften the unknown consequences.</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">According to the Biosafety Committee in Spain
         (2011), synthetic biology faces four large ethical aspects:</SPAN></P><UL><LI style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">-     -</SPAN><SPAN lang="EN-US">The development of synthetic or
         artificial life</SPAN></LI><LI style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">-     -</SPAN><SPAN lang="EN-US">The scientist’s responsibility</SPAN></LI><LI style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">-     -</SPAN><SPAN lang="EN-US">Biosafety norms within
         Synthetic Biology</SPAN></LI><LI style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">-     -</SPAN><SPAN lang="EN-US">Copyrights</SPAN></LI></UL><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">First is the
         development of artificial life. How will this affect society and its members?
         How people will react according to their beliefs, traditions, and cultural
         upbringing? In a world were synthetic organisms and natural organisms coexist,
         biodiversity would no longer be preserved?. Instead, it would be limited in a
         way that synthetic biology would participate and guarantee the species’
         identity. By doing this, ideas would be reorganized, cons and pros would be
         compared and boundaries would be set. To be necessary, prohibitions against the
         development of these artificial organisms would also come into light (Biosafety
         Committee of Spain, 2011).</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">A very important
         universal human right is the right to freely begin a scientific investigation.
         It is this same right which sets the boundaries to research. It is under the
         scientist’s responsibility to stay within the morals and ethics established by
         society.  This responsibility is rather
         uncertain because it depends on the scientist’s environment, the time being, and
         the circumstances taking place. It becomes especially sensitive when referring
         to synthetic biology because it is a new field with future outcomes not yet
         known. Telling between right and wrong will not always clear.</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">Synthetic Biology represents a new set of
         potential risk factors for biosafety. Some of them include the use of it for
         destructive goals like biological weapons, or any other synthetic creation with
         destructive potential. Even though most of the work on synthetic biology is
         done under laboratory safety conditions, the behavior of these synthetic
         entities outside of the laboratory is uncertain.</SPAN></P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">The final ethical issue has to do with copyrights. There have always existed ethical issues due to copyrights and patents. These problems are predicted to be even bigger for synthetic biology. They are also, slightly, more complicated than the general structure of a copyright. Problems, concerning how to recognize a patent on a technological environment that blends various products and procedures already patentable as well as their interdisciplinary and interdependence, stand out (Biosafety Committee of Spain, 2011).</SPAN></P><P style="text-align: justify;">Synthetic
         biology proves to possess a positive approach towards many areas of importance
         in our society. Nevertheless, it deals with a wide range of ethical factors
         that scientists focusing on these studies must be familiar with. No results can
         be obtained without responsibility.</P><P class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><SPAN lang="EN-US">In Honduras, all
         these issues are taken into consideration. Since Honduras has been through this
         before, when introducing transgenic plants for crops, as a country, we know it
         is important to incorporate an equal plan of activity for synthetic biology,
         biotechnology and the traditional activity that has been going on for all these
         years. The introduction of a new science takes a long time, especially in
         developing countries. You first have to introduce the idea in society and into
         the legal system of the country. This will allow new sciences and society coexist
         in peace.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="art-page-footer"><SPAN id="art-footnote-links">Designed by <A href="www.bluemas.com" target="_blank">Blue+</A>.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
