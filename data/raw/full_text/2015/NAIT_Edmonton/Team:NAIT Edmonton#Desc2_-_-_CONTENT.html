the staining protocol, will develop colour bands in specific positions so as to help in the 

identification of the protein(s) of interest post-staining. In order to do so, investigation of 

how specific amino acids react with silver staining reagents is underway by our team. 

This will have as an outcome the creation of novel proteins that contain an excess of a 

particular amino acid and/or chemical modifications that will generate a specific colour 

after treating it with silver staining reagents. To obtain such proteins, the introduction of 

novel nucleotide sequences into a plasmid would be done first by in vitro transcription 

translation and later by transforming E. coli cells with expression vectors.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
