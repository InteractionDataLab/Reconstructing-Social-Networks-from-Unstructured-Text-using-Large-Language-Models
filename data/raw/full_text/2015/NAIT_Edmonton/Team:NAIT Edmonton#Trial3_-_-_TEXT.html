Week 1 - May 4 to 8
On week one, we focused on finding literature about the specific chemistry of silver staining. In general, we did not find any literature about the specific, molecular interactions of the silver stain dye with proteins. Many of the articles even stated that the exact mechanism of silver staining remains unknown.
Week 2 - May 11 to 15
This week, we researched on the scientific basis of color. More specifically, we looked into how the interaction between silver, protein and the polyacrylamide gel produces a certain color. We found that the size of silver nano-particles and the refraction of light is how we perceive different colors.
We also tried to look into the electron cloud and how electron excitation produces certain wavelengths of light
Week 3 - May 18 to 24
Our research continued for the source of color in silver staining.
We attended the geekStarter workshop hosted by Alberta Innovates at the University of Calgary on Sunday, May 24. We presented questions about iGEM to a panel of experts. We also got one on one "speed-mentoring" with the experts as well as an exclusive group meeting with each of the four experts. Meeting the University of Lethbridge team was also quite cool!
After meeting with the experts, we decided to put the literature review on the back burner so that we could proceed with actual, physical experiments.
Week 4 - May 25 to 29
This week, we focused on perfecting our silver staining techniques. We are currently troubleshooting our gels because the stain comes out quite dark and with a lot of background staining.
We also started reaching out to local start-ups and companies looking for sponsorship and further funding.
Planning our wiki and how we want it organized also took place this week.
Week 1 - June 1 to 5
This week, we worked on and finalized the DNA sequences to be sent to IDT.
We also continued perfecting the silver staining techniques outlined by our principal investigator. Unfortunately, we are still experiencing difficulties in background clarity. We tried to switch out the vessels used during staining because we thought that residual silver was affecting our gels. However, even new pyrex containers did not make a difference in our final stained products. We are thinking now that the BioRAD Silver Stain Plus kit that was provided for us contains defective reagents.
Week 2 - June 8 to 12
