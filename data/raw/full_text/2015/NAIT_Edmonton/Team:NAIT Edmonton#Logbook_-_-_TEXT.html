Research into Silver Staining
Before beginning a project, it is of great importance to fully understand what it is you are planning to research. Our team focused on understanding the basics and chemistry of silver staining completely.

Happy Canada Day!
July 1
Pumping out those Sequences
This week, our team really focused on creating a variety of sequences for testing. Equipped with the knowledge from our literature searches in prior weeks, we crafted each sequence carefully and diligently. As a team, we created and ordered over 25 this week!
June 29 to July 3
And so the cloning begins...
Dr. Marcet helped us get started with cloning! But first, we had to test our enzymes to see if they will properly linearize our plasmid!

Expressing our Custom Sequences in our E. coli
Got our sequences inserted (hopefully) and now we want to grow our bacteria!
July 10

July 24 to 26
Team Re-Branding
Today, we stepped away from our original iGEM inspired logo and tried to come up with a new                                     team identity so that we could stand out from the crowd and our team would leave a lasting                                       impression in iGEM.

NAIT Photoshoot and Mini-Prep
We had another photo shoot with our institution! Eduardo and Joy managed to escape early,                                               because of a plasmid mini-prep.

Let's Work Together!
Our team is new to iGEM so we are helping out others as best we can. We've completed many surveys and given feedback to many teams!
August 6
Title and Abstract.. Submitted!
Today was the due date for the final abstract and title for iGEM's brochures and websites.

Abbie's Back!
Abbieâ€™s last day working her full-time summer student position as a lab tech for Keyera AEF. Time to get into the lab and work on the project!
August 14
Go, Team NAIT, GO!
We're getting an overwhelming amount of support from NAIT. We're even getting golf shirts to wear in Boston!
August 17
Argentum ... Re- IM[Ag]INE 'd
Turns out, we cannot use Argentum as our team name. There is a local company that has trademarked that brand and we do not want to get into any trouble.

Watch our Intro Video!
We have a new respect for anyone who has to be in front of the camera as their career.. This less-than-two-minutes video took us a few hours to shoot and edit.
Watch it! August 20
iGEM Banner
Final banner design finished and ready for sending to iGEM HQ. We cannot wait to see our banner hanging at the Hynes Convention Centre.
August 21
Collaboration with our New Application Track
As you know, we're a first-time team. We reached out to our Track mates and asked them to help us out.

August 26-28
Digestion of Sequences
All our sequences (23) were digested and in doing so each were cleaved at specific sites to later ligate with our plasmid, pSB1C3.
August 26
IDT Interview
We got interviewed by one of our primary sponsors, IDT!
Read more August 27
Digestion of Plasmids + rSAP
We digested our pSB1C3 plasmids to cleave each at specific restriction sites      to be able to insert our sequences of interest.
August 28
Presentation.. Round Two!
We presented to NAIT's Office of Research and Innovation again to give them       a rundown on our current progress for our project.

August 28
Sequence and Plasmid Ligation
Ligation was conducted on our sequences of interest to join and bind with      our plasmid pSB1C3 (T7+RBS) backbone.
August 29
Transformation!
From ligation, all novel sequences were transformed and plated. We counted a total of 302 colonies from this experiment. (THEY ARE ALIVE!!!!)

August 31 to September 2
Colony PCR
Four 96 well plates and many agarose gels later... We obtained the colonies that  showed to have taken up our sequences!

September 2
Grew Our Colonies
To ensure our colonies would produce adequate protein when induced, we prepared them for harvest during their log phase of growth.
September 5
IPTG Induction of Proteins
We're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel! We induced our proteins with IPTG when they had an absorbance of approximately 0.8.
September 8
Back to School for NAIT students!
Noooooooooo

Ni NTA Kit Purification!
Received our Ni-NTA kit from the University of Alberta.
September 10
IM[Ag]INE Shirts have Arrived!
Additionally, we finished pelleting and purifying more samples of our proteins. Unfortunately, not all of them showed a concentration in the NanoDrop.
September 11
Preliminary Results
After four months of work, we completed the last step of our experimental design - SDS PAGE and Silver Staining of our synthetic proteins.
Read more
September 13
Experimental Validation
We ran more gels in order to validate our preliminary results. Regrettably, the gels failed to run properly and we were unable to finish in time.
September 14
The End of our Lab Journey
And so it ends. Today, we pulled the plug on all remaining lab work and running experiment. Now, it's time to focus on our Wiki, Poster and Presentation.
September 15
Wiki FREEZE!!!!!
Had a blast browsing through our fellow iGEM team's tweets about #WikiFreeze. We're definitely scrambling. AHHH!!!!
