I delivered the graduation speech at my middle school graduation ceremony. I am a five time national winner in a nationwide fine arts competition. I enjoy sports a lot, I run and swim, I enjoy physically demanding workouts, and I enjoy reading a lot. <B>Fun Fact:</B> I have traveled to over two dozen countries. I went on a science expedition to the Galapagos Islands with my dad for a NASA earthquake project and had to ride a horse for eighteen hours straight in order to visit all the stations around the volcanoes on the islands. </P></DIV><DIV id="williambio"><P style="font-size:130%"><U> William Fu </U></P><P>Hi I’m William Fu, and I’m a junior at La Canada High School. I am interested in math stuff and modeling stuff. I am interested in biotech and mathematics, so I’m here  to experience a less esoteric subject (mostly did cluster computer and math stuff) for modeling and I want to take my computers out for a spin again. I am glad to have the opportunity to work on this fantastic team this year! (If needed I can also write iphone/android apps too, same w/ Rudy)<B>Fun Fact:</B>  I drink tea. Also most people call me wfu (woo-foo). It’s not wufu, that spelling is incorrect. </P></DIV><DIV id="rudrabio"><P style="font-size:130%"><U> Rudra (Rudy) Menon</U></P><P>Hi I’m Rudra Menon, I am a junior at La Canada High School. I am very interested in computers and more specifically, computer programming. I have found myself to be more compatible with computers than living things. For example, I’ve recently become engaged in coding artificial intelligence simply because I wanted to play board games with something that doesn’t try to converse with me. I am beginning to fear my obsession has whittled away at my ability to connect with breathing beings on an emotional level. I am joining the biotech team in desperate hopes to get back in touch with natural life. This is primarily so I can learn about “real” life on the basic level in order to one day create a master race of bits and bytes. <B>Fun Fact:</B> When I’m not playing connect four with myself I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee. I find the sports scene to be a remarkable opportunity to observe the peculiar behavioral patterns of animate beings. </P></DIV><DIV id="matthewbio"><P style="font-size:130%"><U> Matthew Yu </U></P><P>My name is Matthew Yu and I’m a junior at La Canada High School.  I am highly interested in synthetic biology/biotechnology and science in general.  I have taken various synthetic biology/biotechnology classes over the past few years and I look forward to having fun on this amazing iGem team this year! <B>Fun Fact:</B> I love music and I can play 7 different instruments, of which piano is my main.  I can speak in 9 different languages, but most is quite limited.  I know how to play 4 different sports and enjoy each one of them. </P></DIV><DIV id="matthewbio"><P style="font-size:130%"><U> Cathey Seo </U></P><P>Hey!
