Human Practices
        Our iGEM team believes that through education, we will be able to change the mentality of people of all ages about the uses of fuel and our alternatives. For our Human Practices section, we interacted with students that were K-12, students at the college level, and the community at large.
K-12
        Our iGEM team felt that sparking the interest in young students would help them understand what the future of fuel holds. We had a video conference call with Rio Vista Elementary School fifth grades. Thanks to the help of Tracie Bennett, who allowed us to speak with her students, we were able to teach students about our project. Students were able to ask questions regarding our lab or biology in general. We had a great time teaching the bright young students, and we hope that they now know a little bit more information on the world they live in!
