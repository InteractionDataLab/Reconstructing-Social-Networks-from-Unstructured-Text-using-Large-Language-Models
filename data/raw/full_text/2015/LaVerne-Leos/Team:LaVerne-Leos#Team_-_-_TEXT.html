Alec Lourenço
My name is Alec Lourenço, and I’m a junior at La Canada High School. I got interested in synthetic biology as a freshman and then participated on the Caltech 2014 team as a sophomore. Now I’m glad to have the opportunity to work on this fantastic team this year!
Fun Fact: I am an absolute sucker for teas. I’ll Chai any type of tea, just as long as you don’t steep it Oolong. Oh, and I’m also from Florida
Christos Menemenlis
Hi! My name is Christos, a freshmen at La Canada High School. I don't really matter, I just try to juggle school and everything else at the same time. I am interested in life, learning, and something that I don’t have. Science is just a really interesting discipline to me, and the more I study and learn about how it affects our lives, the more interested I get. I guess it’s just natural curiosity.
Fun Fact: Only 8 people I have ever met have pronounced my last name correctly on the first try… five of them were my own family.
Miles Yun
Hello. My name is Miles “Sung-Joon” Yun. I am currently a freshman at LCHS. I enjoy science and history. I am a great public speaker. I delivered the graduation speech at my middle school graduation ceremony. I am a five time national winner in a nationwide fine arts competition. I enjoy sports a lot, I run and swim, I enjoy physically demanding workouts, and I enjoy reading a lot.
Fun Fact: I have traveled to over two dozen countries. I went on a science expedition to the Galapagos Islands with my dad for a NASA earthquake project and had to ride a horse for eighteen hours straight in order to visit all the stations around the volcanoes on the islands.
William Fu
Hi I’m William Fu, and I’m a junior at La Canada High School. I am interested in math stuff and modeling stuff. I am interested in biotech and mathematics, so I’m here  to experience a less esoteric subject (mostly did cluster computer and math stuff) for modeling and I want to take my computers out for a spin again. I am glad to have the opportunity to work on this fantastic team this year! (If needed I can also write iphone/android apps too, same w/ Rudy)
Fun Fact: I drink tea. Also most people call me wfu (woo-foo). It’s not wufu, that spelling is incorrect.
Rudra (Rudy) Menon
Hi I’m Rudra Menon, I am a junior at La Canada High School. I am very interested in computers and more specifically, computer programming. I have found myself to be more compatible with computers than living things. For example, I’ve recently become engaged in coding artificial intelligence simply because I wanted to play board games with something that doesn’t try to converse with me. I am beginning to fear my obsession has whittled away at my ability to connect with breathing beings on an emotional level. I am joining the biotech team in desperate hopes to get back in touch with natural life. This is primarily so I can learn about “real” life on the basic level in order to one day create a master race of bits and bytes.
Fun Fact: When I’m not playing connect four with myself I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee. I find the sports scene to be a remarkable opportunity to observe the peculiar behavioral patterns of animate beings.
Matthew Yu
My name is Matthew Yu and I’m a junior at La Canada High School.  I am highly interested in synthetic biology/biotechnology and science in general.  I have taken various synthetic biology/biotechnology classes over the past few years and I look forward to having fun on this amazing iGem team this year!
Fun Fact: I love music and I can play 7 different instruments, of which piano is my main.  I can speak in 9 different languages, but most is quite limited.  I know how to play 4 different sports and enjoy each one of them.
Cathey Seo
Hey! My name is Catherine Seo, but people call me Cathey. I’m a senior at La Canada High School and I love math and science. I love music, sports (specifically tennis), and learning new things. I’m really grateful and excited for this amazing opportunity and look forward to what this year has!
Fun Fact: I live at Panera or my friend Caitie’s house and I LOVELOVELOVELOVE boba/pearl tea.
