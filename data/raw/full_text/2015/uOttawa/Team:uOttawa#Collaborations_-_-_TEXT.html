Collaborations
Waterloo
uOttawa has historically collaborated with Waterloo iGEM . This year, Waterloo helped us to construct and analyze a mathematical model for our genetic network. They also helped to compare this model to existing ones from literature, and to find parameters that make tri-stability possible.
We helped Waterloo by improving their DNA assembly workflow, and attempting to assemble a troublesome plasmid. However, a crucial DNA fragment chronically failed to PCR. Nevertheless, we continued to assist Waterloo by troubleshooting their own DNA assembly with particularily problematic parts.
Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Five iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team.
uOttawa, being a rather senior team among oGEM, contributed with many years of experience to improve the work of the other teams. We mentored other teams on how to assemble DNA cheaply and efficiently, how to select protocols and chassis organisms, and how to present the project effectively to iGEM. In particular, we helped McMaster, a team new to iGEM, on how iGEM works and how to most effectively perform the cutting-edge science that we do all summer.
