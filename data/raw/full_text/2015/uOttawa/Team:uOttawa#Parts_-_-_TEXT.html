Parts
Although uOttawa constructed 8 different promoters (see the Promoters section of our project page), only a single one was confirmed to transform correctly. Thus, we only submitted a single biobrick, albeit with reliable characterization.
This part is an improvement to two biobricks from uOttawa's 2014 project. Read more at the improvement page . <groupparts>iGEM2015 uOttawa</groupparts>
