Our project was inspired by the famous coloring book “Secret Garden”. When I first heard about this book on Weibo, I don’t think it’s an interesting book, but later, I saw so many people around me hold this book and create so many brilliant pictures all with different combinations, I was shocked by this “underaged” book. Than me and my teammate discussed about it, the main point of synthetic biology is creativity, use biology tools to make new possibilities, the same idea as this coloring book. So we decided to combine this two different thing together, make it “Secret Biology”.

We would like to put different promoters and different colored protein DNA sequences together, and user can use different solution contain different materials which can promote the production of one colored protein.

Finally, if we can put as many different DNA sequences as possible, people can use our products to create a beautiful bio-painting. Just imagine use different reagent instead of ink, we can make a colorful paintings, by letting E-coli “grow” our paintings by their selves.
