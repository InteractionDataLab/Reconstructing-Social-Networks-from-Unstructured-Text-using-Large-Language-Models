The following safety guidelines were followed:
We used Escherichia coli (MG1655), a wild type strain which cannot survive outside laboratory conditions, to test all our constructs.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogenic strain. It falls under Risk Group 3 organisms and hence we will be using Mycobacterium smegmatis, a harmless non-pathogenic strain for our proof-of-concept experiments.
Our device has termination sequence which causes cell death after the cells have reached a certain density
We filled all the iGEM safety form.
All biological material were autoclaved before disposal.
Fume hoods were used for corrosive reagents.
Chemical and biological spills,if any, were contained and disposed depending on their nature.
Standard risk management procedure were followed based on the Instituteâ€™s policy.
