Result:
As shown in the antibody responses experiment, the amount of antibody induced by H7N9 virions and VLPs is very similar. This has proved that H7N9 VLPs could efficiently induce cellular and humoral immunoresponse specific to H7N9 virus. In the future, with more developed experiments and testings, VLPs may potentially become a popular method of countering flu and other diseases.
