Simulation Codes
Along the course of our we came across several scenarios to model .
We simulated variations of  the Quorum sensing terminator and the fast robust oscillator which are described by sets of differential equations. To solve them we have used a common template for integration.
The python source code for the Terminator module modelling can be downloaded here.
