Inoculation:
A colony from BBa_C0080 plate was inoculated in 7ml LB media + 7μL Chloramphenicol. Same was done for BBa_C0012. These cultures were kept at 37°C for 12 hours.
28th June 2015
No growth was observed in both the liquid cultures.
A new colony was inoculated again.
29th June 2015
Growth observed in the cultures of BBa_C0080 and BBa_C0012. Gylcerol stocks were made for both.
Plasmid isolation was done using Alkaline Lysis protocol for the 2 cultures. (1.5ml culture x 3)

Plasmid isolation by alkaline lysis
Chemicals required:
CAM antibiotic
LB media
Alkaline lysis buffer 1
Alkaline lysis buffer 2
Alkaline lysis buffer 3
Ethanol
Phenol: Chloroform (1:1)
STE
TE with RNase A
Protocol
Inoculate 5ml of rich media containing the appropriate antibiotic (CAM)
Incubate culture overnight at 37 deg
Pour 5ml of culture into a microfuge tube
Centrifuge in microfuge for 3 min at 4deg
Remove media by aspiration leaving bacterial pellet as dry as possible
Resuspend the pellet in 100microl of ice-cold alkaline lysis solution 1 by vortexing
Add 200microl of alkaline lysis solution 2 , mix with inverting
Add 150 microl ice-cold alkaline lysis solution 3 mix with invertexing
Store tube on ice for 3-5 min
Centrifuge bacterial lysate ,5 min 13000rpm at 4deg in microfuge
Transfer supernatant to fresh tube
Add equal volume of phenol: chloroform
Mix the organic and aqueous phase by vortexing
Centrifuge at maximum speed 2 min at 4deg
Transfer the aqueous upper layer to fresh tube
Add 2 volume of ethanol
Mix by vortexing for 2 min
Centrifuge for 5min at 4deg
Remove supernatant by aspiration
Remove all liquid keeping inverted position
Add 1ml of ethanol to pellet
Centrifuge for 2min at 4deg
Remove all supernatant by aspiration
Remove ethanol beads and evaporate it at room temperature
Dissolve nucleic acid in 50microl of TE containing RNases A
Vortex the solution gently for 2 sec
Store DNA solution at -20deg
Result: no DNA pellet after precipitation by ethanol
Comment: Most probably step 12 is done in incorrect way
