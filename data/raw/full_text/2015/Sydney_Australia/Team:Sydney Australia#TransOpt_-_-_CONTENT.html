It builds upon recent research and understanding, and addresses many issues inherent in the overly-simplified approaches currently taken throughout the synthetic biology community. To do this it utilises a simulated annealing approach to optimisation, and can simultaneously tailor multiple properties of any suitable gene sequence. Through optimising the translation of mRNAs in their heterologous expression hosts we hope to ensure efficient and effective expression of the desired genes in convenient and fast-growing host bacteria.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Motivation">Motivation</SPAN></H1><P>Throughout science and industry it is frequently desirous that proteins, such as the mono-oxygenase enzyme on which our iGEM project has focused, be produced in large quantities. This often necessitates expression in non-native hosts, so as to facilitate a more convenient and efficient expression of the protein at high yields. However, the heterologous expression of a protein often remains ineffective when the wild type (WT) sequence of a gene is used directly in the expression host. In addition to approaches such as co-expression of chaperones, a range of sequence optimisation tools have been developed to overcome this,<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">2</A></SUP> which take advantage of redundancy in the genetic code (where multiple codons encode the same amino acid (AA)) to make synonymous changes. These are generally based upon various quantisations of translation rate<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">3</A></SUP> and in some cases may account for factors which impact protein expression, including mRNA secondary structure <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">4</A>, </SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">5</A>, </SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A></SUP>, protein post-translational modifications <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">6</A></SUP>, differing translation rates <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A>, </SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">7</A></SUP>, and the differing tRNA abundances between organisms. <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A>,</SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">9</A></SUP></P><P>However, these approaches to optimisation frequently fall short in reflecting current understanding and research in the field, and thus fail to provide reliable optimisation with any meaningful generality. To address this, for our iGEM project we have developed a new mathematical approach to codon optimisation, TransOpt, based on the latest experimental results and theoretical understanding. 
</P><P>We hypothesise that, due to evolutionary pressure, gene sequences in a native host will already be optimised to provide an efficient translation process in terms of protein folding and production. As a consequence it would make sense that ribosomal initiation rate, rather than potential errors in the ensuing translation, would be the rate-limiting step in a native protein’s production: This results in a system with less energy wasted by protein misfolding, yielding a more competent organism. In order to mimic this, sequence optimisation should therefore attempt to match translational kinetics between native and heterologous hosts, whilst utilising engineering of the ribosome binding site to determine overall production rate. It is the first of these considerations that we aim to tackle with TransOpt.

Based on the assumption that a gene is expressed relatively efficiently in its native host, optimisation approaches therefore aim to maintain translational kinetics under the different cellular conditions of the heterologous host. Though several fairly advanced tools for codon optimisation exist <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A></SUP> many authors continue to employ simple rate-maximisation or harmonisation tools when transferring a gene between hosts.

However, this method frequently proves unreliable, with its failure very likely stemming from the need for slow-translation regions to allow proteins adequate time to fold. This has been experimentally demonstrated, and was confirmed by our own results (see <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#Experimental_Validation">Experimental Validation</A>), where sequences in which fast-translating codons are selected result in substantially decreased protein activity.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP></P><P>Another popular method is Codon Harmonization <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">15</A></SUP> which (in its various forms) attempts to select codons in the heterologous expression host with usage frequencies (Codon Bias) matched as near as possible with those in the native expression host. This, however, is not necessarily the best method for aligning translation rates in different mRNA regions (as will be examined in following sections), nor does it generally consider secondary effects such as mRNA structure (e.g. as approximated by GC content) or tRNA abundances.

This, we believe, is important due to the demonstrated need for both fast- and slow-translating stretches of an mRNA <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">1</A>,</SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">12</A></SUP>, rendering it impossible to make assertions about individual codon rates based on their genome-wide usage (i.e. codons may be used frequently in a genome by virtue of their slowness in translation!). Instead, the methodology of Spencer et al. <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> assumes that the rate at which a codon is translated is a function of the number of (total) tRNAs able to do so, which in turn is a function of the GCN of individual tRNA species within the organism’s genome.

This process, described at length in supplementary material of the paper by Spencer <I>et al</I><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP>, assumes that Watson-Crick (WC) interactions are allowed between a codon and its matching tRNA species, and in some cases between a codon and a similar tRNA species whose binding is permitted due to non-WC (wobble <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">28</A></SUP>) interactions. The rate for WC interactions is proportional to the specific tRNA’s abundance (i.e. GCN), whilst that for the non-WC interactions is proportional to one third of their abundance. This one third “penalizing factor” has been experimentally determined as an approximate slow-down for wobble interactions. <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">29</A>,</SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">30</A></SUP> The rate for a given codon is then equal to the sum of contributions from to these two mechanisms, though some minor exceptions to these rules exist.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> Utilising this quantisation of rate in different organisms introduces the assumption that there is a similar number of tRNA molecules in each organism, which will be a subject of future study.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Determining_Translation_Rate_Trends">Determining Translation Rate Trends</SPAN></H2><P>Rather than defining translation rate based on instantaneous values for single codons, the approach of Spencer et al.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> calculates longer-term trends via a moving average centred at a given location. To take an example, the translation rate at codon location n  \((r_n)\) in an mRNA sequence is equal to mean of the rates \((r_i^*)\) for individual codons between location \(n-w\) and \(n+w\), where \(w\), is the averaging half-width, which we set as \(w = 15\).<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> Expressed mathematically this is:
</P><P>$$r_n=\left(\sum^{n+w}_{i=n-w}{r^*_i}\right)/(2w+1)$$
</P><P>We believe this approach is more physically realistic as it represents the local trend in rates, which has been shown to be an important determinant of success in protein folding. <SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">9,</A></SUP><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">14</A></SUP> This means that, in contrast to standard codon harmonization approaches<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">15</A></SUP> it may be advantageous in some circumstances to choose a codon in the heterologous expression host possessing a substantially <I>different</I> rate to that in the native expression host, in order to optimise the overall trend.
</P><P>An example of why this can be important is demonstrated in <I>Figure 4</I>. Here, a standard codon harmonization algorithm (red) would select synonymous codons with rates of 0.1 and 0.3 for codons C1 and C2 respectively, as these are the closest to the native host rates. This gives a “long term” average rate across the two of only 0.2, substantially departed from the average rate in the native host, 0.45. However, if we instead select codons so as to optimise the average rate we attain a different outcome, with the optimal approach (green) actually choosing a codon with a greater difference in rate from the original host (in this case, selecting C2 rate as 0.8, rather than 0.3, to replace the initial 0.5). Making this choice results in an average rate in the heterologous host of 0.45, exactly the same as that in the native host, despite the fact that we haven’t chosen the closest matching codon at each individual point.

</P><P>To quantise the GC concentration we propose a metric called the GC Richness, defined in a similar way to the long-term translation rate trends discussed above, via:
</P><P>$${GC}_n=\left(\sum^{n+w}_{i=n-w}{{GC}^*_i}\right)/(2w+1)$$
</P><P>Here \(GC_n\)  is the GC Richness (a number between \(0\) and \(1\)) at location n, and \(GC_i^*\) is the GC content of the codon at location i, defined as the proportion of that codon made up of G or C nucleotides (so, GCA would have GC content of \(2/3\), whilst TAA would have GC content of \(0\)). We take the same averaging half-width (\(w =1 5\)) as previously used for determination of the rate.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Optimisation_Technique">Optimisation Technique</SPAN></H2><P>With the defined metrics for translation rate (from here this will just be referred to as rate) and GC Richness in hand, we are ready to begin optimising the codon choices in a sequence for heterologous expression. <I>Figure 5</I> presents an example of these metrics for a ~585 codon length (1755 bp length) piece of mRNA in its native expression host. This therefore forms the target profile of our optimisation algorithm: We will attempt to adjust synonymous codon usage in a new sequence such that in the heterologous expression host both the rate and GC Richness replicate those in the native expression host as near as possible.

As changes to an individual codon will alter both the rate and GC Richness at all points within width \(w\), we are unable to devise any closed-form analytical optimisation method. Instead, we utilise a technique based upon simulated annealing, a commonly used probabilistic approach to global optimisation, which relies on repeated random adjustments to slowly seek out new and better matching sequences. 
</P><P>Put simply, our proposed optimisation method involves defining an energy measure which is a function of both rate and GC richness, making random synonymous changes to codons, and then accepting these changes if they improve the alignment with the target profile, whilst also accepting them with some probability if they decrease alignment with the target profile. This last step, accepting inferior sequences, is included to allow the algorithm to escape local minima in the energy function, though it by no means guarantees a global minimum is ever reached. 
</P><P>The outer algorithm (Algorithm 1) for this approach is concerned with taking the initial codon sequence \((s_in)\), which is used to define target profiles for rate (\(r_t\)) and GC Richness (\(GC_t\)) based on the initial sequence in the natural expression host. This sequence is adjusted via Algorithm 2, and the result (\(s_0\)) is compared to the previous sequence (\(s_2\)) in the heterologous expression host whose rate (\(r_2\)) and GC Richness (\(GC_2\)) best-matched their target profiles (\(r_t\) &amp; \(GC_t\)) from the natural expression host. If the new sequence is an improvement it keeps it (i.e. \(s_2\) is set to equal \(s_0\)), otherwise the new codon sequence is rejected in favour of the previous best sequence (i.e. \(s_2\) is not changed) and the algorithm continues.

</P><P>
This area is calculated in the energy equation as the sum of absolute deviations between the various profiles, and is compared between the sequence with randomly altered codons (\(s_1\)) and the initial sequence (\(s_0\)). A positive energy therefore corresponds to a segment of \(r_1\) in which the shaded area is smaller in magnitude than the corresponding area about the same point in \(r_0\) (the unaltered sequence). Hence, by accepting changes that create a positive energy we are selecting sequences which reduce this absolute deviation between current and target profiles, thereby driving the heterologous profiles towards the target profiles.

This result supported by previous experimental studies of fluorescence proteins, where it has been demonstrated that this commonly used harmonisation algorithm can substantially improve performance (for example, in the work of Angov <I>et al</I><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">15</A></SUP>). To perform this harmonisation we used the translation rate quantisation methods of Spencer <I>et al</I><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP>, and the strong expression here therefore provides evidence for the effectiveness of these methods. In <I>Figure 11</I> it is apparent that the relative utilisation of different codons in this variant is closest to that in the wild type. In <I>Figure 9</I> we see that, despite the weaknesses we believe exist in this optimisation method, in this simple protein it has provided fairly well-matching translation rate and GC Richness profiles.
</P><P><B>Fast Codon Utilisation </B></P><P>The fast optimised sequence presented a substantially decreased fluorescence when compared to the wild type sequence. This is also as anticipated, and agrees with previous results which have shown the necessity for both slow- and fast-translating regions in mRNA.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">14</A></SUP> In fact, our result aligns very closely with the work of Spencer <I>et al</I>,<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> who similarly developed a synonymous sequence using the fastest-translating codons, and found its activity dropped to approximately half of its wild type performance. 
</P><P>A number of possible causes for this exists. For example, when using only fast-translating codons there may be insufficient time for co-translational folding of the protein, hampering its activity. However, another potential cause in this case (as examined qualitatively by our <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Modeling/visualisation">visualisation tools</A>) is tRNA starvation: If all codons that encode a single amino acid are substituted by for a single codon species, that species' utilisation throughout the sequence will be substantially increased, potentially resulting in starvation of its corresponding tRNA species during translation.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">31</A></SUP> This is apparent in <I>Figure 11</I>, where it can be seen that the fast variant utilises a far smaller subset of the available codons, but uses each with a higher frequency. In the cell this might therefore be exhibited in starvation of these particular species, which is simulated by our <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Modeling/visualisation">visualisation tools</A>. Not only can this slow translation, but may in extreme cases result in stalling, which can activate ribosomal terminating mechanisms causing premature termination of translation.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">32</A></SUP> Either of these mechanisms can cause an decrease in the cell's overall protein production, which would correspond to a decrease in fluorescence as our experimental results have demonstrated. 
</P><P><B>TransOpt</B></P><P>The TransOpt optimised sequence showed the weakest fluorescence, performing only marginally better than, and within experimental error of, the control measurement. This is not the result we had hoped for or expected, but as with all good science, sometimes important lessons can come from negative outcomes.
</P><P>A number of potential causes for this failure exist, central among which might be our choice of test protein, BsFP. Though this comes from <I>B. subtilis</I>, as we have demonstrated even in its wild type form it can function effectively in <I>e. coli</I>, potentially due to its relative simplicity and short length. A major motivation behind TransOpt is the optimisation of sequences to account for both sections of fast- and slow-translating proteins, as well as mRNA folding. So, without a sufficiency complex protein that requires these controlling factors during translation, perhaps it is unsurprising that TransOpt would not outperform standard codon harmonisation methods. This is illustrated by <I>Figure 9</I>, where we see that both the WT and standard-optimised sequences do not differ very substantially from their target profiles, and hence we would expect them to perform <I>relatively</I> well. However, this does not explain why the fluorescence measured by TransOpt is so substantially decreased that it fails to (within error bars) outperform control measurements with non-fluorescent samples. One possible explanation may be that the TransOpt method has introduced a reliance on codon species that the heterologous expression host is unable to support. 
</P><P>We can identify some such species if we compare codon usage between the different protein variants. This reveals four codons (GCC, CTA, TCG and ACT, marked by red circles in <I>Figure 11</I>), which are <I>not</I> used in either the WT, Fast or Standard variants, but <I>are</I> used in the TransOpt variant. Therefore, if our <I>e. coli</I> strain was unable to effectively translate any one of these codons, for whatever reason, this could cause a failure in protein production. A potential target for investigation would be the last of these codons, ACT, for which the corresponding tRNA (AGT) in <I>e. coli</I> has copy number zero, and it thus must rely on the wobble interaction with other species for translation. If we examine the overall codon usage for the TransOpt sequence (<I>Figure 11</I>) we see that it differs more substantially from the wild type than the standard harmonisation variant, though less so than the fast variant. We can also see numerous locations where the fast and standard optimised sequence utilise codons not found in the wild type sequence, however, this did not appear to prevent their expression.

However, we believe that due to its scientific underpinning this method should not be discarded, and may be improved substantially by future work.
</P><P>Though we believe that the failure of TransOpt to yield reliable function of BsFP may be a result of this protein's simplicity, short length, or potential errors in our fluorescence measurement experiments, the analysis of these results does highlight the possibility for tRNA starvation within the cell to play a role in protein expression. The mechanisms by which this occurs are demonstrated by our <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Modeling/visualisation">visualisation tools</A>. Furthermore, for this particular protein the unchanged WT and standard-optimised sequences match quite well with the target profiles in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> (<I>Figure 9</I>), leaving the TransOpt algorithm little room to make any substantial improvement.
</P><P>A major improvement for TransOpt would therefore be inclusion of measures to account for this starvation: This would necessitate an additional parameter for optimisation; an expression to account for the overall usage frequency of each codon (as a total for the entire mRNA sequence, as plotted in <I>Figure 11</I>). Matching the ratios of these usages (as best as possible) to the tRNA GCNs would help to minimise the chance of tRNA starvation, as we would be utilising tRNAs at a rate as close as possible to the rate at which they are being produced. The astute reader will notice that in this we are proposing something similar to past efforts in codon optimisation: The matching of the codon usage between organisms. In the past this was done because codon usage was believed to correlate with rate of translation in some way. However, our motivation is substantially different: We hypothesize that codon usage instead balances with the differing rates of production between tRNA species, and in doing so regulates (and perhaps prevents) tRNA starvation. 
</P><P><B>Other possible extensions</B> of TransOpt include improvement of parameter estimations, and addition of other metrics during optimisation:
</P><P>At present the TransOpt algorithm treats the rate and GC Richness profiles, which it aims to optimise, entirely independently of another. This leaves open the possibility for added optimisation terms in the energy equation, as represented by the arbitrary function \(f\) inserted at its end. Therefore, if in the future alternate measures of an mRNA’s “fitness” are derived, which are in some way a function of its codon sequence, the algorithm can be easily extended to optimise the profile of these measures: All that needs happen is their value be calculated and fed through the algorithm, much in the same way that the GC Richness value is at present. 
</P><P>The weighting factors \((\alpha \ \&amp;\ \beta )\) in the energy equation are used to determine the relative weighting of the rate and GC Richness optimisation terms. Such semi-arbitrary factors are ubiquitous in a range of optimisation techniques, as a means to scale the importance of different quantities to be optimised, and are generally (as they have been here) experimentally determined. Via greater experimentation with our algorithm it may be possible to choose better factors to replace these, which would certainly be necessary should we include any additional optimisation terms. This might serve to decrease convergence time of the algorithm, however, we found similar resultant sequences were formed when these parameters were changed, so perhaps this is unlikely to improve the algorithm's performance from a biological perspective. 
</P><P>Though we have used the quantisation of codon translation rate as proposed by Spencer <I>et al</I><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> this choice makes no impact on the TransOpt algorithm’s mechanism. The rate quantisation is only responsible for providing data for different codon rates, which being essentially arbitrary to the algorithm’s function can be changed to anything desired. Therefore, it is possible to easily alter the TransOpt algorithm to utilise any quantisation of rate (for example, the Codon Usage Frequency / Codon Bias). That said, due to the strong fluorescence  of our standard harmonised BsFP variant (which utilised the Spencer <I>et al</I> rate quantisation), it appears that the Spencer <I>et al</I> rate quantisation is functioning (at least to some extent) as intended.
</P><P>Further study could also advise the choice of averaging width (\(w\)), which impacts the GC Richness and rate profiles. At present this is set to the value recommended by Spencer <I>et al</I><SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">8</A></SUP> and is meant to reflect a characteristic length over which the translation process’s kinetics are impacted by the mRNA sequence. Decreasing this value would allow finer-resolution matching of a sequence to the target rate and GC Richness profiles, but would come at the expense of this match’s accuracy. If we set \(w=1\), then TransOpt would essentially return the same sequence as standard harmonisation tools: In each individual location it will return for the best matching rate. To properly assess this parameter’s impact greater experimental data would be necessary, which could involve further study on the interdependency of translation rate and protein folding.<SUP><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/TransOpt#References">9</A></SUP></P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</SPAN></H1><P>We have developed a new approach to codon optimisation, TransOpt, which aims to match several properties of a sequence in its heterologous expression host to that in the expression host. The mathematical approach to optimisation, simulated annealing, works exceptionally well, and demonstrates a capability to match these properties very accurately between sequences. However, experimental results demonstrated that in our test case a TransOpt optimized sequence did not function as expected: It resulted in negligible expression of a fluorescent protein. We identified a number of possible causes, such as this protein's simplicity and the fact that the TransOpt sequence utilised a number of codons not found in any of the other, more successful, variants. These variants included a sequence optimised by standard harmonisation methods, which showed a substantial increase in fluorescence over the wild type sequence, and a sequence in which only fast-translating codons were selected, which showed a substantial decrease in fluorescence compared to the wild type. These outcomes confirm previously published results regarding codon usage, and demonstrate that our rate quantisation metrics are functioning (to some degree) as intended. Finally, future improvements to the TransOpt algorithm are identified, and we suggest topics for future study which could more rigorously test certain features of TransOpt.
