Team
Throughout out our project we kept a detailed and through notebook and timeline. We found that having a daily, weekly, and monthly structure greatly helped in our time management. As we are a team in the Southern Hemisphere, we undertook our project during university semesters and thus effective time management was critical in helping us balance university, iGEM, work, and everything else.
Example of our week-by-week schedule
Every day in the lab we would begin by asking ourselves what needed to be done that day and in what order. After every day we evaluated our progress and asked ourselves four questions -
What did we achieve?
How efficient were we?
What can we improve on?
What is the plan for tomorrow
Thus, we knew exactly what experiments needed to be done on each day. This allowed us to work faster and more efficient, it also created an easy transition between the different lab members as one member could pick up where the other left off without having to chase them down to find out the important information about the past experiment.
Furthermore, we had weekly meetings and the occassinal skype session.
William Ramsay once said:
"Progress is made by trial and failure; the failures are generally a hundred times more numerous than the successesÂ ; yet they are usually left unchronicled"
This was not the case for our team as we sought to extensively chronicle all the successes and failures. We hope our observations and troubleshooting will help future iGEM teams.
See below for a week-by-week account of our work.

Monday
Aim - PCR amplification of pBSIC3 using Phusion and visualization using gel electrophoresis
Result - Several bands present, yet bigger/smaller than expected 2 kb fragment
Tuesday
Aim - A gel was run with a thermocycling gradient (59.4, 61.3, 63.6, 66.2, 69, 71.6, 74, 76) to determine the best annealing temperature.
Result - The thermocycling gradient showed that 69 was the most suitable temperature.
Aim - PCR amplification (annealing temperature of 69 and 98 cycles) and gel electrophoresis of EtnAB, EtnC, EtnD, Gro1, Gro2 G-blocks using primers iGEM1501 and iGEM1502. The gel was stained with Gel-Red.
Result - The gel electrophoresis showed high molecular weight smears. These were though to be the result of contaminants in the reagent.
Wednesday
Aim - Second attempt of PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis of pBSIC3 with an annealing temperature of 69 and 35 cycles instead of 98

Result - successful elimination of plasmid using DpnI
Thursday
Aim - Make up new working stock of primers 1501 and 1502 and the third attempt at running the PCR and gel electrophoresis of  pBSIC3 from 30/6/15 and 1/7/15.
Result - The no-template-control yielded no DNA bands. All other lanes showed smears.
Friday
Aim - Fourth attempt at PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis of pBSIC3 from the 30/6/15, 1/7/15 and 2/7/15.
Changes to the PCR protocol  *same conditions for Gro2 *GC buffer instead of HF buffer for Gro2 *Using Taq pol and Taq buffer for Gro2 *1/10 of DNA template *Shorter primers  *Same conditions using Abi's G blocks
Results - Large band of correct size was seen with Taq polymerase, using the same primer. Both G-blocks and the primers are working as expected. Next step: eliminate all plasmid, digestions with more DpnI should be performed again with more DpnI
