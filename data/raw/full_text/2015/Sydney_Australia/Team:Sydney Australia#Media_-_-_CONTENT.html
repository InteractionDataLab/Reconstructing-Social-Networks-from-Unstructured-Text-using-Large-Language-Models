</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Science_Teacher.27s_Association_of_NSW">Science Teacher's Association of NSW</SPAN></H3><P>Our article on the Strange Nature writing competition and the iGEM competition was published in the Science Education News magazine. This magazine is distributed to thousands of Science Teachers across NSW. We elected to target teachers as a particularly efficient method for spreading awareness: Each teacher with an understanding of Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering technologies can share their knowledge with hundreds of students. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Wentworth_Courier">Wentworth Courier</SPAN></H3><P>Our team was featued in the Wentworth Courier newspaper. We wrote an article on the competition, our research, Strange Nature, and the importance of community education and involvement in scientific research. The newspaper has a readership of over 50 000 people! You can read the article <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.pressreader.com/australia/wentworth-courier">here</A>.

On the 17th of September, we had 185 likes, 60% of which were females and 40% were males. Our largest audience was those between 18 and 24 year olds, this was expected given majority of them were our friends. We found facebook to be an incredibly useful and easy platform for promotion, communication, and discussion. It was also the perfect place to thank our sponsors.
