Throughout out our project we kept a detailed and through notebook and timeline. We found that having a daily, weekly, and monthly structure greatly helped in our time management. As we are a team in the Southern Hemisphere, we undertook our project during university semesters and thus effective time management was critical in helping us balance university, iGEM, work, and everything else. 
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Example of our week-by-week schedule</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Every day in the lab we would begin by asking ourselves what needed to be done that day and in what order. After every day we evaluated our progress and asked ourselves four questions - 
</P><OL><LI>What did we achieve? </LI><LI>How efficient were we?</LI><LI>What can we improve on?</LI><LI>What is the plan for tomorrow </LI></OL><P>Thus, we knew exactly what experiments needed to be done on each day. This allowed us to work faster and more efficient, it also created an easy transition between the different lab members as one member could pick up where the other left off without having to chase them down to find out the important information about the past experiment.
</P><P>Furthermore, we had weekly meetings and the occassinal skype session. 
</P><CENTER>William Ramsay once said:
<P><I>&quot;Progress is made by trial and failure; the failures are generally a hundred times more numerous than the successes ; yet they are usually left unchronicled&quot;</I></P><P>
This was not the case for our team as we sought to extensively chronicle all the successes and failures. We hope our observations and troubleshooting will help future iGEM teams.
