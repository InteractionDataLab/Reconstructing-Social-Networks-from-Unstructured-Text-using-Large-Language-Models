Week 24
We have been cleaning and organizing the lab over the whole week.
We set all the working stations with the necessary equipment and run the autoclave, dishwasher machine and the drier.
We made several research plans on signal transduction in our system and planned for next weekâ€™s experiments.
At the end of week, we came up with the idea of a preexisting OmpR dependent osmo-regulatory system in E. coli.
