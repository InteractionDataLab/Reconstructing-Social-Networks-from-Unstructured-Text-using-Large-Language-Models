Recognition Team
The recognintion team was set-up to create the bacterial antiagen receptor (BAR) for our ABBBA assay. We have been working of the EnvZ receptor to create a fusion protein with a affibody for protein biomarker recogningtion.
Week 24
We researched the EnvZ receptor to get an understanding of its function.
We researched tested chimeras with EnvZ as well as receptor with similar function to our intended BAR, such as peptide receptors.
We discussed with Roger Draheim the possibility to use EnvZ for our BAR and got some great information.
We started creating the genetic construct for our receptor and modeled the recogingtion domain.
