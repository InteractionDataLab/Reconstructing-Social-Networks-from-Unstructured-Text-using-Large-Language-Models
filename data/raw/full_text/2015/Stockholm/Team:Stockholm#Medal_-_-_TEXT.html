Medal requirements
Bronze medal requirements
Must achieve a total of 6 goals.
Goal
Status
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Done
Complete the Judging form.
Done
Create and share a Description of the team's project and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Done
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Done
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Done
Attributions
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
Done
Parts
Silver medal requirements
Must achieve a total of 3 goals.
Goal
Status
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. This working part must be different from the part you documented for the Bronze medal.
Done
Parts
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion.
Done
Parts
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Done
Practices and Ethics
Gold medal requirements
Must achieve at least 2 goals.
Goal
Status
Choose one of these two options: Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
Done
Transparency project
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Done
CGU Taiwan
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see the Registry Contribution help page for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your team's 2015 range of part numbers.
Done
BBa_M30011
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
