We, as iGEM Team Stockholm, are confidently standing behind the presented data. We have put a special effort not to modify the actual picture that we got by conducting our experiments in any way.</P><P>Our project has been developed independently from other projects. We are not really building up on a single project. We discovered that the iGEM Team from Dundee 2013 has been working with a chimeric version of the EnvZ as well. Therefore, we have analysed their project and adjusted our experiments accordingly. After request, we were also very happy to receive the EnvZ deficient E.Coli strain BW25113 from Dundee, in person of Frank Sargent and Chris Earl.</P><P>We have been also inspired by the work that has been already conducted with the OmpR signaling cascade. Notably, the former iGEM Teams from Technion Israel. </P><H2>Supervisors</H2><DIV class="row superad-row"><DIV class="col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-7"><P><A href="https://www.kth.se/profile/farsan/"><B>Johan Rockberg</B><I>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</I></A>He heads a research group at the department of Proteomics and nanotechnology at the KTH School of Biotechnology.

He has been independently conducting similar experiments as we have and we could thus compare our data to his results. Among these experiments, you can find the prediction of EnvZ (extracellular domain) and the characterization of the EnvZ gene in his expression vector from which we derived our EnvZ biobrick (BBa_1766008). In both given examples, we got to similar results and can therefore give a confident conclusion to these results presented. He has provided us with the MDG147 and EPB30 strains which have a genetically integrated YFP/CFP reporter system depending on the phosphorylation status of OmpR. We would like to thank Roger for his advice, feedback and constructive suggestions throughout the entire project.</DIV></DIV><H2>Others</H2><UL><LI><P><B>Gunnar von Heijne</B>, <I>Stockholm University</I>, has provided us with many good contacts (among which we find Roger Draheim) and has helped us to get the answers we needed from experts in the field.
