ABBBA: Affibody-Based Bacterial Biomarker Assay
Early diagnosis is important for patient prognosis. As a rule of thumb, the earlier a disease is diagnosed, the better the odds for recovery. Studies show that treatment for many different diseases (e.g. cancer) are more efficient when therapy is started at an early stage.  Yet, reliable, sensitive and easily applicable diagnostic tools are still lacking.
iGEM Stockholm 2015, consisting of students from Karolinska Institutet and the Royal Institute of Technology KTH, is developing a novel technique to measure even small amounts of disease biomarker in body fluids. It's an "Affibody-Based Bacterial Biomarker Assay", and we call it ABBBA.
