Complete the Judging form and all required consent forms.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Collaborate with another team or become a mentee for any iGEM team that has previously participated in the iGEM competition and is attending the 2015 Jamboree.
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, our team has has achieved the following 3 goals:
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry ( K1624001 , K1624008 ). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page ( BBa_K352002 ).
Document the characterization of an existing part in the 'Main Page' section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry ( J64997 ).

Help an iGEM team from another school or institution to meet a specific experimental or modeling goal by, for example, characterizing their part, debugging their construct, or modeling or simulating their system ( Collaborations ).
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Silver medal criterion #1. ( K1624002 )
