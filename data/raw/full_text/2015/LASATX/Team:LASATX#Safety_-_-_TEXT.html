General Safety
Prior to being assigned and fully able to work in the lab, each member had to complete an online training given by the University of Texas Austin Department of Environmental and Health Safety.  Students also had to complete an on site fire extinguisher training course in order to obtain a position to work in the wet lab.  The online courses covered proper disposal mechanisms for toxic substances, lab attire and PPC, the use of the MSDS, and other topics in order to aid the students in creating a safe working environment.  When in the lab, students learned how to properly work the equipment such as the argon gas used to flush out the chamber used for testing.
Chemical Components
CORM
In order to test the carbon monoxide detection pathway, the team used a Carbon Monoxide Releasing Molecule 2 (CORM 2).  Because the use of CORM was done in solution within the suspended cell cultures, the hazard of inhaling gaseous carbon monoxide was prevented.  Also, all the testing with CORM was done in a well ventilated chemical hood.
DMSO
This substance was used to suspend the CORM when the team was ready for testing.  It was used within a chemical hood and the team members wore proper PPC prior to handling the substance.
Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
The team used this substance when making gels for gel electrophoresis.  The substance was used within a well ventilated chemical hood and very small quantities were used to minimize potential health risks.
Biological Components
The team worked with an unharmful strain of E. Coli for testing.  This vector was chosen for its relative abundance and ease of transformation.  The E. Coli used for testing was also constrained to one laboratory to further reduce health risks.
