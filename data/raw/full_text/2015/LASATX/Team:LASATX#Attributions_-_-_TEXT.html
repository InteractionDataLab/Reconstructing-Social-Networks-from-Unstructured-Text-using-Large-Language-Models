Andrew Ellington
University of Texas at Austin: Biochemistry Professor and Principal Investigator at Ellington Lab
Dr. Andrew Ellington has been an invaluable supporter of our team, by providing us his laboratory and resources to make this entire project even possible. Dr. Ellington provided the team of high schoolers an opportunity to gain hands-on, laboratory experience and provided excellent counseling and guidance in the design of the project and the analysis of the data. He also has generously funded the majority of this project and helped point the team to the right people to talk to. Working in the Ellington lab was an opportunity the team greatly appreciated and was fortunate enough to have.
Dennis Mishler
University of Texas at Austin: Barrick Lab Research Educator
Dr. Dennis Mishler, from the UT iGem team, has provided much guidance to this team by meeting with students every week and checking the progress of the project. He helped the team troubleshoot many details of the project and helped the team analyze the collected data. The LASATX team also gained an opportunity to help and collaborate with the UT iGem team and learn new techniques to apply to their own project. Dr. Mishler and his team also guided the LASATX team in presentation techniques, effective methods of conveying information to judges, and Human Practices.
