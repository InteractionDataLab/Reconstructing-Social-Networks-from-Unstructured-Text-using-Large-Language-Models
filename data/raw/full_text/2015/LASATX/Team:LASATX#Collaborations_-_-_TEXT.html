Collaborations
We collaborated with the UT iGEM team, helping them with wet lab work in carrying out their Redesigning Decaffeination Plasmids experiment. We streaked plates with bacteria containing various combinations of three genes, to test the effectiveness of the genes on detecting three methyl groups (positions 1, 3 and 7), positioned on caffeine at different locations.
We helped run a 'Painting With Bacteria' booth with the UT iGEM team at the 2015 SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas where we informed the public about basic synthetic biology concepts and guided visitors in streaking fluorescent bacteria on agar plates ('painting' with bacteria). Pictures of the booth can be found here .
We also held weekly meetings with Dr. Dennis Mishler, an instructor for the UT iGEM team, who gave us feedback on our project.
