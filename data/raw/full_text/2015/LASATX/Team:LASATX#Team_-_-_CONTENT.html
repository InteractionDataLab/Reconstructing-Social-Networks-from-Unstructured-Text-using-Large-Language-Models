Since that “era”, she has cemented her plans and aims to attain an MD PhD which would allow her to both practise and research medicine.  She has participated in Science Olympiad since her times in middle school and has been able to medal in her events which include Chemistry Lab, Anatomy &amp; Physiology, and Protein Modeling.  She has also been active in research since her freshman year in high school through the Synthetic Biology Club and a Biomedical Engineering internship in which she works on tissue regeneration of the kidney and pancreas through the use of naive state stem cells.  Since her time in middle school, Kisha has also been active in the field of clinical medicine  in that she has been interning at a pathology lab and has had hands on experience with human tissue sectioning, various staining methods, histology, etc.  She has also shown her interest in the field of medicine by taking various classes at school pertaining to Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics.  Aside from her scientific pursuits, Kisha has been playing tennis since elementary school and competes at the Regional level and has performed dance since she was in elementary school.  Kisha also enjoys writing poetry and was a semifinalist in a national competition and has been published by the Poetry Society of America.  She also loves to play the flute, which she picked up in the fourth grade, and has been self learning how to play the shehnai, the Indian oboe.  Kisha also actively volunteers through the Red Cross, which she is president off, and at local hospitals where she also actively views neurosurgeries and various other procedures.  In her freshman year, through the Red Cross, Kisha was able to lead a group of high school students to raise enough money to vaccinate a village in Africa against Measles and Rubella.  Through these efforts, Kisha has adamantly decided to become a member of the Doctors Without Borders organization after she earns her academic degrees.

He is also considering minoring in Chemical Engineering. Volunteering at the Seton Medical Center – where he performed equipment audits, restocking, and inventory for patient rooms on the 5th floor – has only strengthened his interest in the medical field. He was one of about 50 students who were selected to attend the Dell Medical School Health Sciences Camp, a one-week intensive educational joint program with the Austin Independent School District in which students participated in activities such as: lectures by various medical and health specialists, a clinical skills lab, and a hands-on human cadaver lab sponsored by University Medical Center Brackenridge. Motivated by a passion for medicine and a sense of purpose in helping others after seeing friends and family affected by medical conditions, he hopes to eventually go to medical school, but not before experiencing what Biomedical Engineering has to offer. He is an officer and a founding member of LASA Chinese Culture Club as well as the Service Project Chair for LASA Red-Cross. He also spends part of his time with LASA NaNoWriMo, a writing club. He is a member of the Microanalysis Society, and has attended the 2014 and 2015 Microscopy &amp; Microanalysis Meeting, which attracts researchers and professors from around the world including Nobel Laureates. He ran six half-marathons, including the Austin Half Marathon consecutively for four years starting at the age of 14. He placed 8 out of 154 in his division (Male 19 and Under) in the 2014 Austin Half Marathon. His best time was 1:33:38 in the 2015 3M Half Marathon, and plans to run in the upcoming Austin Full Marathon in February. He also spends much of his summer and fall as part of the LBJ Marching Band, after learning how to play the flute three months prior to joining. Oliver has also played the viola in the LBJ Orchestra.

She currently helps with iGEM website support and advises club officers. She helped come up with the general idea for the iGEM project. Outside of synthetic biology/ iGEM, she plans to major in computer science because she likes how logical programming is, and how if something goes wrong, it’s almost definitely the programmers fault. In the computer science vein, she is the co-president a women in computer science club. She is really interested in the brain and intelligence and wants to eventually go into computational neuroscience research or machine learning, and currently is involved in neuroscience research. Because she loves to come up with creative arguments and doesn’t mind having her worldview invalidated, she regularly seeks out philosophical discussions. Outside of school, she is mostly found in the pool in her 10th year swimming with the Austin Angelfish,a nationally ranked synchronized swimming team, and 3rd year as co-captain. She is also in her second year swimming with the LBJ/LASA swim team.
