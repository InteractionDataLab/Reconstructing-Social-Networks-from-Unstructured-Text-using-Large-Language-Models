New Parts
pCooF-RBS
Short Description: promoter and rbs, activated by CooA transcription factor
Long Description: part of the pCooF operon and ribosome binding site downstream, activated by the CooA transcription factor bound to carbon monoxide.
T7-Wintergreen
Short Description: continual expression of a wintergreen fragrance
Long Description: the wintergreen pathway under constituent promoter T7. pchBA and BMST genes convert chorismate to salicylic acid the methyl salicylate, the desired wintergreen fragrance.
Whole Construct
Short Description: responds to presence of carbon monoxide with wintergreen smell
Long Description: CooA transcription factor binds carbon monoxide, and this CooA-CO complex activates the pCooF promoter, which regulates expression of the wintergreen pathway. The wintergreen pathway consists of the pchBA and BSMT genes. This pathway converts chorismate, an endogenous molecule in E. coli bacteria to salicylic acid with the pchBA protein, and salicylic acid to methyl salicylate, or the wintergreen fragrance, with the BSMT protein. Thus in the presence of carbon monoxide, this part creates a wintergreen fragrance.
