Dr. Ellington provided the team of high schoolers an opportunity to gain hands-on, laboratory experience and provided excellent counseling and guidance in the design of the project and the analysis of the data. He also has generously funded the majority of this project and helped point the team to the right people to talk to. Working in the Ellington lab was an opportunity the team greatly appreciated and was fortunate enough to have.
