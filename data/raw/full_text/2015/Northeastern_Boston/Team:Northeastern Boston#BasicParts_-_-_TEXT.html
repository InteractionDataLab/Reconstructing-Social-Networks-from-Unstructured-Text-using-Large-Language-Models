BASIC & COMPOSITE PARTS
BBa_K1857001 Hygromycin B Resistance Cassette
Recognizing that the iGEM repository lacks a modular selection marker for microalgae, Northeastern submits a Hygromycin B resistance cassette. This composite part was cloned from pOpt_mVenus_Hyg and adapted to the iGEM standards. As a complete resistance cassette, this part is expected to confer Hygromycin B resistance to any Chlamydomonas reinhardtii transformed with this part.
This part contains intron 2 of RBCS2 after a fusion HSP70A-RBCS2 promoter. [ 1 ] Aph7'', a phosphotransferase, confers resistance to Hygromycin B at agar antibiotic concentrations up to 200g/mL. [ 2 ]
BBa_K1857000 mVenus Fluorescent Protein
This part contains mVenus, a nuclear codon-optimized YFP variant (excitation/emission: 515/528nm) [ 3 ]. It has Intron 1 and 2 of RBCS2 for increased expression. This is the first independent fluorescent protein codon-optimized for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii submitted to the iGEM registry.
