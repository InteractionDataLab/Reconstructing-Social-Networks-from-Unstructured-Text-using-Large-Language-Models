Handbook for non-model iGEM organisms
Despite Chlamydomonas reinhardtii being a model organism in the world of microalgae research, its presence at iGEM has been virtually non-existent. With a few exceptions like Concordia 2014 and Valencia 2012 , microalgae has made little of an appearance. While we hope our protein expression plasmid makes it easier for future teams to use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we went further by contributing to a dedicated non-model organisms guide.
The partnership, facilitated by Yale 2015 , includes the following five teams: Concordia 2015 , Cornell 2015 , University of British Columbia 2015 , University of La Verne , and Utah State University 2015 .
The guide itself appropriately stresses the need for both time and resources for non-E. coli species and emphasizes the utility of in-lab experience to help guide the project. We hope it is of use for future iGEM teams.
