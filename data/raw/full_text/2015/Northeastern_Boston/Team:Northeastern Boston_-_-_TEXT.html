"Dr. George D. Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said the crisis had pointed up shortcomings in biodefense. 'Nobody is really prepared,' he said. 'Nobody in the world has rapid response capabilities.'"

Standardizing Protein from Algae
Project
Humans need a quicker method for producing antibodies. Learn about our project.
Human Practices
Meetups, talks, collaboration, and some investigation of what synbio really means.
Interlab
Three promoters, one fluorescent protein. We compared expression.
The primary benefit of microalgae for antibodies is their quick and cheap scale-up. We envision kgs worth of antibody being produced by microalgae in raceway ponds for rapid and inexpensive availability.
