I had to be a part of Northeastern’s first iGEM team because I believe that advancing synthetic biology is going to make this an even more amazing time in history to be alive. Serving as a graduate student advisor for the undergraduate team was great fun, and it was rewarding to watch the team members grow and make progress over the summer.</P><H3>Sanjin Hosic</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical &amp; Moral Support</H4><P>Sanjin Hosic is a PhD student in Northeastern's chemical engineering department advised by Professors Shashi Murthy and Abigail Koppes. Prior to pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering, Sanjin earned his BS in Chemical Engineering also at Northeastern University. After graduating in 2011, Sanjin worked as a Process Engineer at Nantero, focusing on development, scale-up, and technology transfer of carbon nanotube purification and formulation processes. In 2013, Sanjin joined Cubist Pharmaceuticals where he developed and optimized downstream purification processes for preclinical, clinical, and commercial small molecules. Sanjin's current research is focused on bioMEMS and microfludics. </P><H3>Caitlin Kramer</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical &amp; Moral Support</H4><P>I work on elaborating the protein-mediated mechanisms of DNA damage and tolerance, a better understanding of which can help us combat antibiotic resistance and cancer development. My ongoing growth in science is fueled by the passionate and knowledgeable people in this city-sized idea incubator which is Boston. I believe that computational ability and biology are not just running in parallel--they are on a collision course.</P><H3>Hema Madaka</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical &amp; Moral Support</H4><P>I am a 2nd year Masters student in Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University. As a chemical 

engineer, I have always had a passion for renewable energy and biofuels. Since global warming has 

become very pervasive, people have become more aware of its negative effects and want to switch to 

alternate sources of energy such as biofuels. After graduation, I would like to start a company of my 

own. It was a great learning experience as an advisor for the iGEM team and was satisfying to watch the 

team progress over the summer.</P><H3>Marissa Puzan</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical &amp; Moral Support</H4><P>Marissa joined the ABNEL research group and Northeastern University in the fall of 2014, where she is currently pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering. She received her bachelor’s degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2013.

Marissa’s research focuses on designing an in vitro, tissue engineered model of the intestine, combining the epithelial cell layer, enteric neurons, and luminal components. She looks to use this model to study the affects of various toxins and metabolites on enteric neural signaling pathways, intestinal inflammation and immune response, and epithelial cell barrier composition. The developed model may lead to new developments in the treatments of neurogastroenterological diseases, such as autism, depression, or irritable bowel syndrome.</P><H3>Alison Wirshing</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical &amp; Moral Support</H4><P>I graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a BS, and my undergraduate research involved methods for growing microalgae for biofuel production and genetic engineering of the microalgae <I>Dunaliella</I>. My initial graduate research at Northeastern University was on a collaborative project where I worked in both the Lee-Parsons Lab (Chemical Engineering and Chemistry Departments) and Cram Lab (Biology Department) studying lipid production and gene expression in the microalgae <I>Chlorella vulgaris</I>. My current graduate work in the Cram Lab is on understanding the role of the actin cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction and tissue contractility using <I>C. elegans</I> spermatheca.</P><H2>Instructors</H2><H3>Lisa Amelung</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical Support &amp; iGEM Guru</H4><P>I am a graduate student from Hannover, Germany, currently enrolled in an exchange program in a Neurobiology lab at Northeastern University. When I heard of this year’s iGEM team I was reminded of my time as a student in the 2014 Hannover iGEM team. I thought that this would be a great opportunity to share my knowledge with Northeastern’s iGEM team. Although I could only help while advising, I had a great time meeting the team and gaining the insight into a project that has great potential. This project stands out because of its novel approach of producing proteins in microalgae.</P><H3>Dr. Godoy-Carter</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical Support &amp; Guidance</H4><P>Veronica Godoy-Carter is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University. Her research group is interested in studying a multiple protein complex formed by components involved in important DNA transactions when cells are exposed to DNA damage. This is a condition that induces the expression of error-prone DNA polymerases, the activity of which might lead to mutations. Their long-term goal is to learn about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of error-prone Y family DNA polymerases. They use bacteria as a model system and especially Escherichia coli. Due to its relative simplicity, studying basic processes in bacteria will render mechanistic insights that would be difficult to attain directly in more complex systems. </P><H3>Dr. Lee-Parsons</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical Support &amp; Guidance</H4><P>Carolyn W.T. Lee-Parsons is an Associate Professor at Northeastern University, jointly appointed between the departments of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry / Chemical Biology. Her research interests involve engineering the metabolism and regulation of natural products from cultures of medicinal plants and biofuels from microalgae to improve the supply of critical pharmaceutical compounds and the productivity of biofuels.</P><H3>Irina Santourian</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:20px">Technical Support &amp; iGEM Guru</H4><P>I am a graduated exchange scholar from Hannover, Germany working on a collaboration project in Erin Cram’s and Carolyn Lee Parsons’ lab at Northeastern University. By coincidence I noticed the foundation of the first Northeastern iGEM Team. As an emerging scientist I wanted to share my scientific knowledge with the iGEM team and to support the teams efforts to gain an understanding of the production of proteins in microalgae.</P><H2>Acknowledgements</H2><H3>Benjamin Geilich</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">iGEM Guru &amp; Fundraising</H4><H3>Anh Phong Tran</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Facilities Support</H4><H3>Aspasie Song</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Social Media</H4><H3>Victoria D'Agostino</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Fundraising</H4><H3>Matthew Mazzone</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Fundraising</H4><H3>Matthew Moutinho</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Planning Support</H4><H3>Hannah Worden</H3><H4 style="color:#848484;margin-bottom:40px">Planning Support</H4><H2>Sponsors</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
