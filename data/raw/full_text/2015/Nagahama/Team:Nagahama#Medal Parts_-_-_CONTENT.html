<I>ispA</I> encodes Farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase can utilize both dimethylallyl and geranyl diphosphates as substrates, generating geranyl and farnesyl diphosphate, respectively. Therefore the enzyme can catalyze two sequential reactions in the polyisoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.

We want to make the <I>E. coli</I> produces farnesol and geraniol which are one of the terpenes. To produce great quantity of terpenes they need many terpene precursor. <I>E. coli</I> produces a small amount of the terpene precursor in MEP pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes (<I>ispD</I>, <I>ispF</I>, <I>idi</I>, <I>dxs</I>) which are speed limiting enzyme for terpenes precursors produce in <I>E. coli</I>. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into <I>E. coli</I> to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway. To confirm increased production of terpene precursors by Terpene precursor mass-production device. We put attention on ubiquinone. Ubiquinone 8 is made from Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) which is one of the terpene precursors. quinone is one of the electron carrier present in the cell membrane of prokaryotes. And also they glow when exposed to UV rays. In the measurement of production of quinone it was measured by thin-layer chromatography. (TLC silica gel)

Result: 
(fig1) The left lane is analysis of ubiquinone 8 by thin-layer chromatography. The right lane is JM109 /Terpene precursor mass-production device with IPTG  Left lane is JM109/Terpene precursor mass-production device IPTG minus . Both it was 2μl spot.
The right of the figure,Estimation of ubiquinone-8 content instead Each intensity of spots indicating the content of ubiquinone-8
From two figures, those which are overexpressed in reintroduced to <I>E. coli</I> four genes, it is better to have overexpressed were many production of ubiquinone 8 as compared with those that do not overexpress

Discussion:
From this result, the amount of ubiquinone 8 of the final material by the increased amount of terpene precursors is increased by re-introducing the four genes are over-expressed in <I>E. coli</I>.
Therefore, it considered could strengthen the MEP pathway.

Farnesol is probably generated through FPP hydrolysis by endogenous phosphatases, which are induced by an increased intracellular FPP level. Analogously, we hypothesized that <I>E. coli</I> could produce farnesol under cellular conditions of an increased intracellular FPP level through metabolic engineering. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in <I>E. coli</I>. Because of its high hydrophobicity and low volatility, decane was chosen to extract and solubilize farnesol from culture broth. The decane overlay in the two-phase culture did not affect growth, and farnesol could be solubilized in the decane phase with negligible volatile loss. We adopt 1 mL of decane overlaid to 5 mL of culture broth. Two-phase culture of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (BBa_K1653025) was carried out in 2YT medium containing  1% glycerol at 29°C for 48 h. The decane phase of the two-phase culture was collected to analyze the farnesol content by GC-MS. In the GC-MS analysis (Fig. 3 A-G), there was a main peak at 8.5 min in the collected decane phase sample, which corresponded to the reference solution of the standard farnesol compound dissolved in decane. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the peak at 8.5 min was farnesol (Fig. 3-A). However, the peak was not observed in two-phase culture without introducing BBa_K165025. The formation of farnesol from FPP was further confirmed by blocking FPP synthesis. In the GC-MS, the farnesol peak was observed in <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (BBa_K1653025)  culture, whereas no peak was observed with transformed <I>E. coli</I> JM109. It was found that farnesol need not only ispA(BBa_K1653018) but also MEP(BBa_K1653024) in <I>E. coli</I>.　We submit new part(BBa_K1653025)  as producing farnesol.

Geraniol is generated through GPP hydrolysis by geraniol synthase. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in <I>E. coli</I>. <I>E. coli</I> engineered with Geraniol production device (BBa_K1653027) showed different smell as compared with the counterpart control (pSB1C3) and the original strain JM109. This result was obtained by the double blind test following the questionnaire survey. And then we tried to detect that the geraniol generated by engineered <I>E. coli</I> by GC and GC-MS. Geraniol was not detected. These results may suggest that <I>E. coli</I> with Geraniol production device produces less than the lowest limit detected by GC and GC-MS.

In existing part's information of <I>marA</I>, it gives <I>E. coli</I> resistance against kanamycin only. In this year, we confirmed that overexpressing of <I>marA</I> gives <I>E. coli</I> resistance against geraniol as one of the terpene and decrease its intracellular concentration. This information is very beneficial for other iGEMers to production of toxic organic substances that are produced using bacteria. 
We introduce an activator gene of AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (MarA) to release the  geraniol from the cells and increase the content in the media that shows increase these flavors in the &quot;Flavolator&quot;. In our study, we confirmed that overexpressing of <I>marA</I> gives host <I>E. coli</I> high resistance against geraniol and reduce intracellular geraniol concentration.
