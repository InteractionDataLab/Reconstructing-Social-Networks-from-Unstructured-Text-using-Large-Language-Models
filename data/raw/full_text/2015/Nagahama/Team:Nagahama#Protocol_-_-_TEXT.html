Result here
Preventive effect of grated garlic
We prepared 20g pork and 5g garlic . We left the pork for an hour on the table and grated garlics. We spread the garlic grated on the pork （A）.  We left the two pork  in the box at 18℃ for 2 month. Left pork (A) didn’t change the color. Right pork (B) changed Pink to Brown. We found from this result that fragrance of plants have antibacteril volatiles.
Preventive effect of grated Wasabi root
We prepared some rice cake and 10g wasabi . We left the rice cake for an hour on the table and grated wasabi. We spread the wasabi grated on the rice cake (A）. We left each rice cake in the box at 18℃ for 2 month. Rice cake of the above (A) didn’t change the color. Rice cake under (B) changed white to Black. We found from this result that fragrance of plants have antibacteril volatiles.
Confirmation of anti-mold and antibocatrial activities of geraniol and farnesol
Storage of food by geraniol  A:ddH2O（300 μl） B:geraniol（stock solution, 300 μl） Incubation: 35 days Temperature: room temperature Chopsticks dipped in suspension of Penicillium was put in the center of the bread.
Penicillium was cultured among the left box(A), and Penicillium wasn’t cultured among the right box(B), suggesting that Penicillium can’t be cultured in a state where geraniol is filled. This experiment indicate that geraniol might be the effect of suppressing the growth of bacteria
isoprenoid production
Because of its high hydrophobicity and low volatility, decane was chosen to extract and solubilize farnesol from the culture broth. The decane was overlaidy in the two-phase culture media, but it did not affect the cell growth, and farnesol could be well solubilized in the decane phase with negligible volatile loss. We adopt used 1 mL of decane to overlayid to the 5 mL of culture broth. Two-phase The culture of E. coli JM109 (BBa_K165025) was carried out in 2YT medium containing 1% glycerol at 29°C for 48 h. The decane phase of the two-phase culture was collected to analyze the farnesol content by GC-MS.
Analysis of ubiquinone-8 synthesized by E. coli
1. Put E. coli cells in: methanol (7: 2).
2. Sonicate cells  for 30 sec. and cool down 30 sec. and collect supernatants. ( 6 times).
3. Spin down the supernatants at 12,000xg, 10min at 4 ℃, and  dry up acetone and methanol.
4. Add 400μl of chloroform : methanol ( 1 : 1 ) to the dried supernatants. Add equal volume 0.7% NaCl and spin down 12,000xg 5min at 4 ℃.
5. Extract the lower layer
6. Add 100μl of chloroform  : methanol (2: 1).
7. Spot the extracts on TLC plate and develop extracts  using benzene : acetone (7 93).
