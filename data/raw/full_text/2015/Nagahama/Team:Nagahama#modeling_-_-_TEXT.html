Abstract
Our project is preserving food without cooling by flavor that E. coli produces
Therefore, We asked Team Tokyo-Tech to calculate the sufficient amount of culture fluid of E. coli which produce Geraniol (flavor) and time that Geraniol functions to preserve of the food in a certain lunch box.
Setting the situation and method
They constructed a model that They were preserving rice in a certain lunch box and laying the “Geraniol sheet” which contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E. coli on the bottom of the lunch box. Rice was packed in the lanch box and the Geraniol sheet put(8W X 8D X 2H) on the center of the bottom of lanch box. The Graniol sheet is 8W X 8D X 2H,It contains concentrated Geraniol produced by E. coli in a culture fluid.
They calculated the concentration of Geraniol in the sheet to surpass the effective bactericidal in the place where it was the lightest after 24 hours had passed since Graniol began to spread in lanch box.
Result
Fig.  7-5-1-1.The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=0[mm]
Fig. 7-5-1-2.The State of Diffusion in the yz Plain at x=50[mm]
Fig. 7-5-1-3.The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=40
They used the culture fluid that E.coli were incubated for 48 hours. After the 48 hour of incubation, the culture fluid contained 183mg/L of Geraniol.
From their simulation, the culture fluid of E.coli should be concentrated 10,000 times in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours. The sufficient amount of culture fluid which they calculated in order to preserve rice in the box was 128L under our model.
