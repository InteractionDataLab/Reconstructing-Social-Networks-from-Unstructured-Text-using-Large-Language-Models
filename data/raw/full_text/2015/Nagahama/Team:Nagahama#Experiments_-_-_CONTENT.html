The results clearly showed that all the volatile substances of wasabi（Japanese horse radish）, rose, garlic and onion had antibacterial properties. In the literatures, wasabi, rose, garlic and onion have antibacterial volatiles, such as allyl isothiocyanate (wasabi), geraniol (rose),allicin (garlic), and lachrymatory-factor (onion). These antibacterial volatiles are produced after complicated pathways, so for their syntheses, various enzymes are required. Then, we searched metabolic pathways in <I>E. coli</I>, in which antibacterial volatiles can be either end products or intermediates. The search hit the geraniol. In <I>E. coli</I>, a precursor of geraniol, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), is synthesized. If we can successfully operate one enzyme to <I>E. coli</I>, it may synthesize geraniol using geranyl diphosphate as a precursor. In this context, we designed our system for establishing the concept of “Flavorator” to build up a brand-new biosynthetic pathways, in which geraniol is produced in the <I>E. coli</I>. 
In doing so, we transfered the three types of genes listed below to create the hyper-producer <I>E. coli</I> of geraniol.

terpene's precursors device (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1653024">BBa_K1653024</A>)
</P><P>We want to make the <I>E. coli</I> produces farnesol and geraniol which are one of the terpenes. To produce great quantity of terpenes they need many terpene precursor. <I>E. coli</I> produces a small amount of the terpene precursor in MEP pathway. In MEP pathway, there are four enzymes (<I>ispD</I>, <I>ispF</I>, <I>idi</I>, <I>dxs</I>) which are speed limiting enzyme for terpenes precursors produce in <I>E. coli</I>. In order to create a high-yield strains producing IPP and DMAPP, we exogenously engineer to superimpose these genes into <I>E. coli</I> to create strains overproducing IPP and DMAPP in a MEP pathway. To confirm increased production of terpene precursors by Terpene precursor mass-production device. We put attention on ubiquinone. Ubiquinone 8 is made from Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) which is one of the terpene precursors. quinone is one of the electron carrier present in the cell membrane of prokaryotes. And also they glow when exposed to UV rays. In the measurement of production of quinone it was measured by thin-layer chromatography. (TLC silica gel)

Result: 
The figure on the left is analysis of Ubiquinone 8 by thin-layer chromatography.  Right lane is JM109 /Terpene precursor mass-production device with IPTG  Left lane is JM109/Terpene precursor mass-production device IPTG minus . Both it was 2μl spot.
The right of the figure,Estimation of ubiquinone-8 content instead Each intensity of spots indicating the content of Ubiquinone-8
From two figures, those which are overexpressed in reintroduced to <I>E. coli</I> four genes, it is better to have overexpressed were many production of Ubiquinone 8 as compared with those that do not overexpress

Discussion:
From this result, the amount of Ubiquinone 8 of the final material by the increased amount of terpene precursors is increased by re-introducing the four genes are over-expressed in <I>E. coli</I>.
Therefore, it considered could strengthen the MEP pathway.

</P><P>Geraniol is generated through GPP hydrolysis by geraniol synthase. A MEP pathway has been shown to synthesize IPP and DMAPP efficiently in <I>E. coli</I>. <I>E. coli</I> engineered with Geraniol production device (BBa_K1653027) showed different smell as compared with the counterpart control (pSB1C3) and the original strain JM109. This result was obtained by the double blind test following the questionnaire survey. And then we tried to detect that the geraniol generated by engineered <I>E. coli</I> by GC and GC-MS. Geraniol was not detected. These results may suggest that <I>E. coli</I> with Geraniol production device produces less than the lowest limit detected by GC and GC-MS.
And geraniol synthetase was not detect by CBB stain. And recombinant <I>E. coli</I> LB21 needed 3 days to grow. There were few coloy in LB plate. These result may suggest that <I>E. coli</I> couldn't grow with few graniol, because graniol has very stong antimirobial.

</P><P><I>E. coli</I> strain engineered with MEP pathway enzymes, <I>ispDF</I>, <I>idi</I>, and <I>dxs</I> , in combination with the enzyme gens, <I>ispA</I>, produced farnesol (Fig. 11B), which was detected by the Gas chromatography/Mas (Fig. 11A-G), having the same retention time as the farnesol chemical sample (Fig. 11A), while the counterpart control <I>E. coli</I> did not produce farnesol under the same conditions (Fig. 11C).　Neither <I>E. coli</I> engineered with MEP pathway enzymes only nor the one engineered <I>ispA</I> only showed any farnesol by the Gas chromatography/Mass (Figs. 11D and E). Farnesol is generated through hydrolysis of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) by the endogenous phosphatases. Increase in farnesol should be associated with an increased intracellular FPP level. FPP is, in turn, converted from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), whose precursors are IPP and DMAPP. IPP and DMPP are end products of MEP pathway that exists in 
<I>E. coli</I>. Conversion to FPP from IPP or DMPP requires ispA (or <I>m-ispA</I>). Following this context, we speculate that <I>E. coli</I> could produce farnesol better than the counterpart control cells under the up-regulated cellular conditions of an increased intracellular MEP pathway enzymes by metabolic engineering in combination with the special enzyme that converts IPP or DMAPP into FPP.

The concentrations of intracellular geraniol from <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) was 42.9 μg/ml, which was 40% lower than that from of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT), 72.2 μg/ml. This figure is suggesting that internalized geraniol could be more efficiently exported through AcrAB-TolC efflux pump following the presumed activation of this gene by introducing the activator <I>marA</I> gene.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Enhancement_of_geraniol_resistance">Enhancement of geraniol resistance</SPAN></H2><P><A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1653020">BBa_K1653020</A></P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:752px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig. 13: Colony formation efficiencies of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 engineered with <I>marA</I> on geraniol overlaid plates.  <I>E. coli</I> JM109 and <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) were spotted on LBGMg agar plates in serial ten-fold dilutions (10⁻¹～10⁻⁵), overlaid with 1.0 % (v/v)　geraniol hexane solution (geraniol solution), and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This figure shows that <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) cells that overexpress the <I>marA</I> product is more survived on 1.0 % geraniol solution overlay plates than the counterpart control <I>E. coli</I> JM109  wild type cells.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:652px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig. 14: Comparison of colony numbers after addition of 0.5 %( v/v) geraniol hexane solution (geraniol solution).   Time interval for treatment was set every 1 hour from 1 hour to 4 hours. A: <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT) + hexane; B: <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) + hexane; C: <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT) + 0.5 % geraniol solution; D: <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) + 0.5 % geraniol solution. As shown in Figs. 14 A and B, treatment with hexane of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT) and of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) showed similar colony numbers during these treatment intervals to those of time zero. This result suggests that hexane at this concentration and duration of time for 4hours did not affect both cell growth. In contrast, treatment with geraniol of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT) and of <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) showed toxicities to both strains (Figs. 14 B, C and D). If we watch the colony numbers carefully, <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) had more than <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT) during these treatment intervals ((Figs. 14 C and D). These results demonstrate that toxicity of the geraniol was less to the strain <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (<I>marA</I>) than the strain <I>E. coli</I> JM109 (WT).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
