UGA-Georgia sent us this part BBa_K1138000 .
In this year, we experimented geraniol production using recombinant E. coli transformed this part before receiving the new GES (geraniol synthase) gene that we ordered to GenScript. But this gene optimized for Methanogens codon usage, so we didn't confirmed geraniol production in E. coli.
Thank UGA-Georgia for sending this part.
