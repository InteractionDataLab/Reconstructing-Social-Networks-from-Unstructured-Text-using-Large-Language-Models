Introduction
</FONT></P><P>We will produce Flavorator in the world. It is our dream. Our dream complete that public people use Flavorator. We need to get various advises (improve point, safety, cost, and cognition.etc) from difference worker. (Farmer, Economist, Family, and engineer .etc) We inform our activity to people by many approaches. This activity could also know iGEM and Flavorator to public. It is important to talk with people. You can gossip your friend about project. Your friend can gossip others about project. Oh? Innovative tool is Human!? Let’s Human Practice!
</P><P><FONT size="2"><B>○Public Engagement~Public Outreach&amp;Dialogue~</B></FONT></P><P>For the dialog with the public we contacted various media and explained them about our project and about synthetic biology in general. 
We chose to contact the public events and Internet, because it is an efficient way to reach as many people with as many different backgrounds as possible. 
Explaining our ideas we learned a lot, because we really had to focus on a general, more marketing-like view about our project, instead of only concentrating on the scientific, technical aspects. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Crowd_funding">Crowd funding</SPAN></H2><P>In general, to the public audience or expert sectors, we explain our project, iGEM activities, and the topics of synthetic biology.  After explanation, we discussed with all participants and often did a survey by questionnaire. Other team often uses the questionnaire, too. Our innovation is quite unique. The idea was to set “Crowd funding”.  Our milestone for our budget from funding was set up to ￥200,000. Fortunately, we got the amount summed up to ￥310, 200. This achievement clearly shows that we had fund-raisers more than we had expected. We had public consensus that our project is worth supporting. This type of activity seems unique in terms of not only the amount of raised fund, but also realization that so many public audiences support us. In Japan, only Nagahama team was successful in setting up “ Crowd funding” and achieving the milestone.
We thought that this action is innovation.

We participated in a poster session and an oral presentation. 
People (Engineering, biology, Economics etc.) took part in the meeting.
We got invited because he was interest with our project and iGEM since we aim to make a food box with antibacterial fragrances.
We got a lot of idea and approach.
This result made us very excited.
iGEM team shoud get a lot of idea.,too.
We need money and idea if team project realize.
We suggest innovative that other team go to events, because team project can’t complete without other adult.
We thought that this action is innovation.

We got invited because he was interest with our project and iGEM since we aim to make a food box with antibacterial fragrances. 
We shared the possibility of developing synthetic biology in western of Japan, and the mayor offered his help as the cooperation from government to government. 
This result made us very excited.
We thought that this action is innovation.

Our presentation with family as a target got a lot of advice from difference age.
We got them about Reality and safety in particular.
Some watcher hoped to know about iGEM.
This result made us think about our project.
We remade our project from it.
We think most people couldn’t watch our presentation.
The INTERNET TELEVISION BROADCAST leave on the web.
They can watch it on the web.
Now, we think the system is innovation.

We needed to inform our activity. 
We made s movie.
And we posted it on Youtube.
We thought that many people could watch it.
Our activity would spread to the world.
This result would introduce to know &quot;Flavorator&quot;!

We did a poster session about synthetic biology.
People doesn’t have accurate knowledge about Syntheticbiology.
Synthetic biology had been strange for audiences who had had a negative image by its name
Though this event, we wanted audiences to know synthetic biology.
They heard us a lot of questions of synthetic biology.
Audiences were interested in synthetic biology.
This action is innovation.
