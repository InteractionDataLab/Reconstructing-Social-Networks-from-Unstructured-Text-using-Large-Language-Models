Future
This year, we could design E. coli to synthesis antimicrobial and insecticidal substances.
Next year, we are going to improve our project. We have 5 points.
Ⅰ:We change the host from E. coli to another microbial.
Ⅱ:We study about RhNUDX1.
Ⅲ:We use MVA pathway.
Ⅳ:We increase a mount of terpene.
Ⅴ:We design E. coli to synthesis another antimicrobial and insecticidal substances.
Everyone surely expects our project!
