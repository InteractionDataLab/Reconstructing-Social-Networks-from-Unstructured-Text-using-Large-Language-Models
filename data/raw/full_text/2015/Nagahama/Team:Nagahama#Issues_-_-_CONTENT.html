A risk to commercialize the “Flavorator”. To address risks, we carried out the Risk Assessment of “Flavorator”. 
There are two risks in this project. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="health_of_humans">health of humans</SPAN></H3><P>The first one is the risk to the “ human health”. If you want to save the food in the “Flavorator” with genetically engineered <I>E. coli</I> cells, there could be a risk of <I>E. coli</I> to adhere to food. As it is well known that <I>E. coli</I> used in the recombinant experiments is harmless to human and/or animals. However, avoiding direct adhesion to the food for preservation is a wise way, if you do not want to unwanted growth of <I>E. coli</I> in the food.  
If you want to save the food in the volatile terpenes, you may meet the risk of these terpenes, as it shows toxic and/or cytostatic activities to the microbes. 
So, we need to consider the risk to human and/or animal bodies.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Solution">Solution</SPAN></H4><P>Experiments using human cells and/or animal cells to assess toxicities to mammalian cells must be accomplished. Animal experiments are also required, although they should be avoided and alternative experiments should be performed if they are possible.
We have investigated previously published works on the toxicities of one of our candidate terpenes. Oral administration to rats showed LD50 of 3.6g/kg body weight. If this rate is extrapolated to human without considering species difference, LD50 will be 216g/person (body weight is assumed to be 60 kg). If we put one-thousandth as a safer threshold dose, i.e., 216mg/person, this dose is quite a lot of amount, as compared with the dose working to microbes. Of course, careful considerations must be done before using geraniol for antimicrobes, if we know geraniol is used as a food additive.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Consult_with_medical_doctor">Consult with medical doctor</SPAN></H4><P>Fig.1：Consultation with Professor miwa.
</P><P>We consult with Professor miwa.(Fig.1)
He is the president of Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology, and he is medical doctor.
Anything, overdose is a poison. (Etc: salt)
Safety of terpene is good to think quantitatively.
LD50 is quantitative thinking.
Eating or taking what is known to be toxic depends on their own responsibility.(Etc: tobacco)
When dealing with recombinants organisms, it is related to the discussion on GM food.
To reveal the concrete impact on the human body.
If you carry a recombinant organism, you must follow the recombinant traffic rules.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Environment">Environment</SPAN></H3><P>The second one is the risk to the &quot;environment&quot;.
Release of <I>E. coli</I> that synthesizes terpenes out of the laboratory has a risk to the environment. We need to develop the container (safety box) that can reserve the engineered <I>E. coli</I> for a longer time with releasing the terpenes, but with confining the cells in the container. Separable filters can be used.
The gene MarA may cause a risk to the environment of increasing antibiotic resistance by increased activities of efflux pumps. Containers (safety box) confining engineered <I>E. coli</I> inside of the containers are required.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Solution_2">Solution</SPAN></H4><P>terpenes are derived from plants, meaning they are
abundant in nature.
Thus, terpenes do not seem to evoke environmental burden, even if they are released from the “Flavorator” into the natural world by misadventure.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Consult_with_expert">Consult with expert</SPAN></H4><P>We consult with Professor Usami.
We have a genetic modification safety committee in our institute, and he is a member of the committee. Advantages of the recombinant.
Recombinant organism is possible to produce, the required amount of the terpene easily.
Therefore, terpene continues to fill in the box.
However, disadvantages also exist.
Recombinant out of the laboratory is regulated by the rules and might be in danger if spread outside of the laboratory.
In this presentation we used <I>E. coli</I> as recombinant organism. 
However, if it is out of the laboratory, there is a risk that would change the ecosystem of the environment.（Because of geraniol）
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Integrating_the_investigated_issues_into_the_design_of_our_project.28Flavorator.29.">Integrating the investigated issues into the design of our project(Flavorator).</SPAN></H2><P>We concluded as follows.( In addition to the above)
As a countermeasure, we replaces the bacteria and the medium directly. As method, we will replace boxes included of <I>E. coli</I> and medium.
The container of the recombinant <I>E. coli</I> could be completely separated from the food by double filter system.
In the future, we will use the other bacteria.
There are two ways.
First, such bacteria could be used, which causes no problem even if eaten by humans（(Etc: Lactobacillus, Bacillus subtilis var. natto)
If you choose Lactobacillus.
Lactobacillus is not only good for intestine to digest foods, but also Lactobacillus can synthetize geraniol.
In overseas, there is also a culture of drinking perfume to control body odor.
The body odor changes by geraniol is great.
However, we do experiments in model organisms.
And, there is a need to make sure there is no expression of harmful genes.
Second, We use bacteria that do'nt need to put a nutrient source.
We use the photosynthetic bacteria.
Since it can live in inorganic environment, there is no need to provide nutrients.
The use of photosynthetic bacteria, which was isolated from the food, could be used in Flavorator.
