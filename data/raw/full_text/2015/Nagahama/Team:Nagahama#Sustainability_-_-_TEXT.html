Introduction
In Japan, iGEM Teams have been decreasing for 3 years. This problem has an impact on our activity. We need to maintain and increase some teams of Japan. Our activity or project need other people. Most of other people don't know our activity. We thouhgt that others understand our activity. We did a poster session and a presentation about synthetic biology
Fig:This result show teams of Japan. There were 11 teams in 2013. There were 9 teams in 2014. There were 7 teams in 2015. iGEM Teams of Japan have been decreasing for 3 years.
Parent‐Teacher Association (PTA)
We did a presentation to our parents and teachers. Our parents supported expence of medium. And a new student of them add in our team. We thougut that we need to introduce our idea. Thanks our parents for our going to Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology.

Flashmen Camp
We did a posteression to Flashmen. We needed Flashmen,because our team keep to exsist at Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology. And we needed their idea to reform our project. We got many different idea.  This event lead a useful time to us.

オープンキャンパス
We did a posteression to High School Students. We need Flashmen next year,because our team keep to exsist at Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology. And we hope that iGEM High School team establish in Japan. We needed their flash idea to reform our project. We got many different idea. This event lead a useful time to us.

iGEM Japan
iGEM teams of Japan need to share a lot of infomation, because new team members change new team members.
Social media is a powerfull tool to reach out more people in introducing synthetic biology and our project. We have a twwiter (＠igem_japan) and a page on facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/iGEM.Japan?ref=bookmarks )
