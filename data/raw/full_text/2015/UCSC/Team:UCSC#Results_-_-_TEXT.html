Fermentation: Butanol
We were able to create several assembled fusion gene using native alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase. We also designed multiple linkers (refer to parts) to complete the designed fusion gene.
Via aerobic growth, we were able to find a peak of butyric acid indicating the fermentation precursor butyryl Co-A . This allows us to predict that we will be able to engineering HVO to produce butanol via additionional fermentation genes.
Field
Of the 4 samples we are able to identify three separate organisms where the two on the right were found to be identical. These three organisms although different all have strong identity related to H. volcanii, H. Gibbonsii, and H. Mediterranean.
