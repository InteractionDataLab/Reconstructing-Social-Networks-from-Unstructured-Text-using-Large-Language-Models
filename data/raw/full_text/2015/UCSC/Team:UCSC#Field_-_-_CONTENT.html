Most cellulases found in nature cannot fold and catalyze properly in a high saline environment.  <I> H. volcanii </I> and most halophiles can withstand environments with high concentrations of salt such as these salt flats in Fremont, CA. Microorganisms that produce cellulases can normally found on decaying plant matter or in the guts of animals that digest woody substances.

</P></TD><TD style=" width: 410px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><B>Aims:</B><P style="text-align: left;">

The primary goal for the Field team was to identify or discover a halophilic microorganism that digests cellulose.
We were able to isolate multiple species of halophile that can thrive off of only cellulose. 

</P></TD><TD style=" width: 420px; vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"><B>Future Goals:</B><P style="text-align:left;">

We'd like to sequence the two organisms found in the <I> Haloferax </I> genus and identify whether they are novel organisms or not.

Starting out no one really knows exactly what to do. Growing from nothing has been the most surreal experience of my life that forced me to realise, I love research. I want to take almost nothing but an idea to help shape and mold the world. I want to use everything I know to help and save people. I believe growing here has given me the stepping stones to do that. iGEM has left me wanting more, without being the top of your class or having something that sets you apart, you’re always just another average student, I know iGEM has changed that for me.&quot;</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="3"><TABLE style=" width: 500px;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Tina DeLeon</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI><SPAN>Biomolecular Engineering Crown College (UCSC) 5th Year From: Fairfield, CA </SPAN></LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I>&quot;Although I have worked on teams before iGEM, I have never experienced such a sublime team chemistry. The Field team has shown me how to be patient when adjusting the pH of a solution, how to perform inoculations, and how to create cellulose growth medias (in addition to many more wet lab procedures). They have given me the strength to ask any and every question, no matter how obvious the answer may be. And they have given me confidence by showing support instead of criticism. The iGEM team as a whole has exposed me to synthetic biology, a field I have never studied. In addition to advancing my social skills in a lab setting, I have also been granted an opportunity to polish my bioinformatics skills. Overall iGEM has been an unforgettable experience and I cannot wait to continue this research in the upcoming school year. &quot;</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="4"><TABLE style=" width: 500px;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Adriana Landeros</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI><SPAN>Molecular, Cell, &amp;Developmental Biology</SPAN></LI><LI> College Ten (UCSC)</LI> 4th Year<LI>Grant Team</LI><LI>From: Salinas, CA</LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I>&quot;My experience with UCSC iGEM has been amazing!

Since then, I have helped design protocols, learned different wet and dry lab techniques, and have gotten familiar with using different kinds of laboratory equipment. iGEM has given me such a different and unconventional lab experience; it has given me the confidence and  leadership skills to attend meet-ups, give oral presentations, take my laboratory skills to a whole other level, and motivate me to follow my passions in science.
