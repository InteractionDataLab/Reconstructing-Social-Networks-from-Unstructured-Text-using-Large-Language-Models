However, the rate of atmospheric carbon accumulation has been increasing exponentially since the onset of industrial age combustion of fossil fuels. Significant changes in global climate can be attributed to increased atmospheric carbon levels, calling an action to start using renewable carbon energy sources. We aim to use waste cellulosic biomass from paper and crop waste as a source of renewable energy by harnessing the catalytic activity of the enzymes responsible for cellulolysis, a class of enzymes known as cellulases, and engineering these cellulases to be tolerant to high saline solutions to reduce the energy cost of the cellulose pretreatment process. 
There are three main types of cellulases: endocellulases, exocellulases, and beta-glucosidases; each play a vital role in cellulose degradation. Endocellulases cleave the hydrogen bonds between crystalline cellulose polymers, exposing the free beta-linked polysaccharide chains. Exocellulases then bind the ends of  loose cellulose strands and cleave the beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds between every two or three glucose subunits producing either cellobiose or cellotriose. Beta-glucosidase finally converts cellobiose into glucose, concluding the cellulose degradation pathway. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><B>Methods:</B><P style="text-align: left;">
We chose to transform Haloferax Volcanii with a B-glucosidase. Our pipeline was to collect data from different cellulases across various organisms, determine which are secreted, and decide which to try to codon optimize to transform into Hvo. 

</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><B>Future Goals:</B><P style="text-align:left;">
Transform Hvo with our - glucosidase(WT) - pTA963C constructs. Then, test each for expression and enzymatic activity.

learn how to efficienty work and communicate with my own team to assure maximum success. 
Over the course of the summer I can say that I have grown both as a person and as 
a researcher. I am truly glad to have taken on such an opportunity and to have been 
able to contribute to the scientific community in some way. The amount of experiences and knowledge
that I was able to obtain in the past couple of months is definitely something that will remain with me far beyond my undergraduate 
years.&quot;</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="2"><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Anissa Benabbas</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI>Biology</LI><LI>Bioinformatics minor</LI><LI>Crown College (UCSC)</LI><LI>Graduate (Post Bac)</LI><LI>Video Team</LI><LI>From: Sunnyvale, CA</LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I>&quot;May name is Anissa, and I am a recent graduate in biology with a bioinformatics minor.

I am the first in my family to go to college and I could not have picked a better school than UC Santa Cruz to study Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics. Being a part of this year's iGEM team has been the most rewarding and challenging experience during my undergraduate career. Because of iGEM, I have learned how to fund-raise for a research project, conduct my own research experiments, explain my research in layman's terms and has solidified my decision on going to graduate school.  &quot;</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="5"><TABLE style=" width: 500px;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>John Poncini</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI><SPAN>Biomolecular Engineering</SPAN><EM><SPAN>Bioinformatics minor</SPAN></EM><SPAN> College 8 (UCSC) 4th Year Grant &amp; Video Team From: Stockton, CA </SPAN></LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I>&quot;I started on the Field Team with an interest in finding and identifying Haloferax species that contain cellulases, enzymes that break down cellulose. The process of screening archaea for cellulases took the majority of the summer so I promptly  switched towards developing a synthetic halophilic cellulase. Using a vast array of computational tools, I developed a pipeline for determining a model cellulase which we will test for expression in Haloferax volcanii. My computational work culminated in the discovery of conserved rare codons in specific gene regions across domains of life, leading towards the development of F.O.C.U.S, our computational strategy for determining rare codons in gene sequences. I hope to soon publish my work as well as continue developing useful computational tools for researchers and future iGEM teams.&quot;</I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="6"><TABLE style=" width: 500px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Tanvir Saini</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI><SPAN>Molecular, Cell, &amp;</SPAN></LI><LI>Developmental Biology</LI><LI><EM><SPAN>Bioinformatics minor</SPAN></EM></LI><SPAN><LI> Oakes College (UCSC)</LI><LI>5th Year</LI><LI> Webmaster, Graphic Design, Grant,Social Media &amp; Video Team</LI><LI>From: Simi Valley, CA</LI></SPAN></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I><I>&quot;Saying that the iGEM experience was simply amazing would be the understatement of the year. As a transfer student from a community college, I was able to utilize and refine my lab techniques. As the summer rolled on I gradually learned far more advanced techniques along the way. I can confidently say that this is the highlight of my undergraduate carrer. Besides lab techniques, I was able to use business techniques and tricks I had learned from leadership positions from my former part-time jobs. With these skills I was able to give it my all on every front. Myself and a few others decided to split our efforts between lab work and fundraising. Together we were able to fund about $23,000, and during this time, these very same colleagues along with the rest of the team, have become my second family. The laughs, discoveries, and frustrations from this experience will follow me into the future. The hands on work I have done here has left me wanting more.&quot;</I></I></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="profile-cont" data-node="7"><TABLE style=" width: 500px;"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Roger Volden</B></P></TD><TD><UL class="list-unstyled"><LI><SPAN>Biomolecular Engineering</SPAN><EM><SPAN>Bioinformatics minor</SPAN></EM><SPAN> College Eight (UCSC) 3rd Year From: San Jose, CA</SPAN></LI></UL></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style=" width: 500px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;"><TBODY><TR><TD style=" padding: 0px;"><P class="left"><I>&quot;I would undoubtedly say that I have gotten much more comfortable with the people I work with in lab, and it has definitely made me more productive and contribute more to everything that happens.
