Field
Background:
Most cellulases found in nature cannot fold and catalyze properly in a high saline environment. H. volcanii and most halophiles can withstand environments with high concentrations of salt such as these salt flats in Fremont, CA. Microorganisms that produce cellulases can normally found on decaying plant matter or in the guts of animals that digest woody substances.
Aims:
The primary goal for the Field team was to identify or discover a halophilic microorganism that digests cellulose. We were able to isolate multiple species of halophile that can thrive off of only cellulose.
Future Goals:
We'd like to sequence the two organisms found in the Haloferax genus and identify whether they are novel organisms or not.

"The iGEM program has been one of the most gratifying experiences of my life. Through it I was able to form a passion for research by developing an experiment  from the ground up that grew alongside me during the summer. It's also a great feeling to actually contribute to the scientific community and potentially have a real impact on the world.  I've gained far more than professional lab skills though, the relationships that I've built and the memories I've made will carry with me far into the future. In all, I've grown more in a few months than I have for years of undergraduate experience."

" Starting out no one really knows exactly what to do. Growing from nothing has been the most surreal experience of my life that forced me to realise, I love research. I want to take almost nothing but an idea to help shape and mold the world. I want to use everything I know to help and save people. I believe growing here has given me the stepping stones to do that. iGEM has left me wanting more, without being the top of your class or having something that sets you apart, you’re always just another average student, I know iGEM has changed that for me."

"Although I have worked on teams before iGEM, I have never experienced such a sublime team chemistry. The Field team has shown me how to be patient when adjusting the pH of a solution, how to perform inoculations, and how to create cellulose growth medias (in addition to many more wet lab procedures). They have given me the strength to ask any and every question, no matter how obvious the answer may be. And they have given me confidence by showing support instead of criticism. The iGEM team as a whole has exposed me to synthetic biology, a field I have never studied. In addition to advancing my social skills in a lab setting, I have also been granted an opportunity to polish my bioinformatics skills. Overall iGEM has been an unforgettable experience and I cannot wait to continue this research in the upcoming school year. "

"My experience with UCSC iGEM has been amazing! The exposure of doing field work and and working in lab has given me the confidence to continue developing my research experience as an undergrad. My favorite part of this summer has been sharing our project with the community. I've been motivated to bringing science presentations and college workshops to low income communities, such as my hometown Salinas where crime rate and gang activity is high. I feel we have the power to inspire the future innovators."

"Participating in UCSC iGEM has been one of the most rewarding and life-changing experiences I have had to date.  Prior to iGEM I had little hands-on experience in a laboratory setting, which was very structured and did not allow me to have the independence or freedom I craved in a lab.  Since then, I have helped design protocols, learned different wet and dry lab techniques, and have gotten familiar with using different kinds of laboratory equipment. iGEM has given me such a different and unconventional lab experience; it has given me the confidence and  leadership skills to attend meet-ups, give oral presentations, take my laboratory skills to a whole other level, and motivate me to follow my passions in science.  All in all, iGEM has given me more than I would have ever expected and I am so glad I took advantage of all the opportunities and valuable well-rounded skills iGEM offered me"

"I've been wanting to participate in iGEM since I first heard about it as a freshman. Finally getting in and participating has been one hell of an experience. The things we've done in our 10 short weeks I wouldn't have thought possible starting and on top of that I met some fantastic people working to the fullest capacity of their skill. To say I'm fortunate to have done this work with these people is an understatement; the skills learned and friends made will likely follow me for my entire scientific career."
