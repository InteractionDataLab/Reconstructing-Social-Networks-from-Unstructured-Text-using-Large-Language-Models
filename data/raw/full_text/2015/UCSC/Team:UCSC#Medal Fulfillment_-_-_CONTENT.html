Your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 6 goals:
<OL id="criterialist"><LI>Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.</LI><LI>Complete the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Forms">Judging form</A>.</LI><LI>Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts (if any) using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.</LI><LI>Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Poster">2015 poster guidelines</A> for more information. </LI><LI>Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. </LI><LI>Develop and make available, via the iGEM GitHub page, an open source software that supports Synthetic Biology based on Standard Parts or interacts with the Registry. (For questions about the iGEM Github page, contact software [at] igem [dot] org.)</LI></OL></P><P><B>Silver</B>: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:<OL id="criterialist"><LI>Provide a comprehensive, well-designed User Guide for your software and upload it to your wiki. Be creative! (An instructional video may work as well.)</LI><LI>Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than &quot;only&quot; a stand-alone app for end users.)</LI><LI>Demonstrate that you followed best practices in software development so that other developers can modify, use, and reuse your code. Provide more than one realistic test case. Examples of best practices are automated unit testing and documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities, and documentation of releases and changes between releases. </LI></OL></P><P><B>Gold</B>: 

 
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved <B>at least two</B> of the following goals: 
<OL id="criterialist"><LI>iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. <B>Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.</B> (See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Practices_Hub">Human Practices Hub</A> for more information.)</LI><LI>Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the issue by creating an online software solution.  </LI><LI>Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials. </LI><LI>Demonstrate your software at the iGEM Giant Jamboree in the software demo suite. You should show a functional prototype that teams can use in following years. (Contact software AT igem DOT org for information about the software demo suite.)</LI></OL></P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6" style="text-align: left;"><H2>iGEM Medals for Energy Teams </H2><P><B>Bronze.</B><OL id="criterialist"><LI>Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.</LI><LI>Complete the <A href="https://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1775">Judging form</A>.</LI><LI>Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.</LI><LI>Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree. </LI><LI>Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
