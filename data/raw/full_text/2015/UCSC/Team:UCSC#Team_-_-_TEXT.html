Who We Are
The UCSC 2015 iGEM Team consisted of 24 undergraduates, who have come together with a single goal in mind. Bringing forward an array of skills, tools, and techniques, we were able to break our team into micro-teams such as:
Outreach
Grant
Video
Graphic Design
Social Media
Wiki Development
Thanks to these teams we were able to fund not only our project, but fund the travel expenses to Boston. For a complete list please check our Attributions page.
Finally with such a large team we broke our main project into sub projects.
