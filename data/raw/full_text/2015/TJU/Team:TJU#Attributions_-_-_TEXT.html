The TJU iGEM 2015 team consists of students from different kind of majors and each of them has contributed a lot to the project. In this summer, we work together and share the pleasure of success with each other. What we learned or reaped is more than experiments skills or specialized knowledge, instead, the invaluable gift we received is our friendship, a broader vision and a sense of responsibility.
Advisor
Yue Liu, the advisor of our team. She tirelessly and patiently assisted with us in project design, experiment operation, wiki construction, human practice and modeling.
