The Whole Team
Our team is made up with 19 undergrads, postgraduate and high school students. Though we range in age from 16-year-old high school student to 23-year-old postgraduate, the great enthusiasm and efforts lead us to know more about synthetic biology in every day. Additionally, we always discuss and solve the problems together, which in return make us a more united group. Devoting our passion and sweat, this iGEM summer has become a meaningful and colorful journey for everyone in here.
Instructors
Our instructor Prof Yingjin Yuan and Dr. Bingzhi Li, for their constructive suggestions and meticulous guidance to our project.
