“I’m now seriously considering doing a biotech masters degree because I feel like I’ve found my niche through this project. Lab work was a bit intimidating at first but all that was needed to get over that was experience. What else do you need to know about me?...hmm...I love Harry Potter!”
Finally, I bought my very first ice cream maker, planning on making ANY ice cream (peanut butter cups was a huge success) and just waiting for my Belgian waffle maker. Also, apparently I talk in my sleep in Slovakian.

From my participation on iGEM 2015 I expect to find the question!

“iGEM has helped me see that science can be something collaborative and involved. I am amazed by how much working with the people who will be impacted by our device has influenced and improved the research we are doing.
I always imagined that scientific research would be a very solitary pursuit, never getting out to engage with the problem you’re trying to solve and the people you’re trying to help. Instead, through iGEM, I’ve learnt that there is a growing need for empathy and a strong social conscience in science and I am incredibly happy that we are moving this way.”
VickyChemist
“Starting this summer I was fully aware of what biology is capable of, but implications had only been an after thought. After going to Amsterdam to help incorporate human practices I have realised how important this link is as it can really drive the research.”
Brooke Biologist
“I can see that biology and computer science complement each other quite well. Synthetic biology adapts engineering and even computation and logic principles which makes it highly accessible to someone without a biology background like me. I would be interested in getting more informaticians to realise this sentiment, as it’s truly exciting!”
AndreeaComputer Scientist
“Working on iGEM really has been an experience I am proud of. Connecting different technologies from contrasting disciplines and getting them to work together to build something cool has changed my view on science. Over the summer I have been able to change my intrigue for synthetic biology into practice and this has definitely made me more open minded about my career plans. ”
Aseem Computer Scientist
“This summer has really allowed me to immerse myself in science and become far more comfortable in a lab environment. There has also been the chance to interact with a very diverse group of people, gaining their opinions on biology in the process, and learning how research can affect the community as a whole.”
Liusaidh Biologist
“ I’ve always been interested in ethics and whether we can say anything meaningful about it, or whether it’s all, strictly speaking, nonsense. In some ways I leaned towards the latter, but now that I find myself in a position to potentially make a difference in lives of people caught in real struggle, I feel as though I have a chance to do something good.
Patrick Philosopher
“Doing this project has allowed me to realise that biology is more than just squishy stuff; it can potentially offer solutions to many problems from space exploration to oil to world hunger. I’m really excited about starting my career and exploring the possibilities of synthetic biology, that’s how iGEM has been so transformative for a fledgling scientist like me. “
