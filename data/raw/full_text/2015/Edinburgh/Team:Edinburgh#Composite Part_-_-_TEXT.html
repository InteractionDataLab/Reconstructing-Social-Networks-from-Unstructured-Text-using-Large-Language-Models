mRFP
mRFP driven by LacI promoter (BBa_K1615090)
mRFP (BBa_K1615089) driven by the IPTG inducible PLlac 0-1 promoter (BBa_K314103). This allows the mRFP gene to express mRFP when induced with IPTG.
CBDcenA+Linker fused to mRFP in RFC25 (BBa_K1615091)
mRFP (BBa_K1615089) fused to the C terminal of CBDcenA + C-terminal linker (BBa_K1321339) in RFC25. If folded properly, this allows mRFP to fluoresce while immobilised on cellulose.
To test the RFP folding when fused to a CBD we placed 200µL of crude cell lysate in a 96 well plate and observed the fluorescence under a blue light transilluminator.
mRFP fused to CBDcenA+Linker in RFC25 (BBa_K16150092)
mRFP (BBa_K1615089) fused to the N terminal of CBDcenA + C terminal linker (BBa_K1321339) in RFC25. If folded properly, this allows mRFP to fluoresce while immobilised on cellulose.
We tested the dissociation of this part on Whatman 54 using isostandard chads. This involved incubating the chads in the crude cell lysate for 10 minutes and then washing them with PBS for various periods time to test the binding affinity of this CBD.

Linker +dCBD fused to mRFP in RFC25 (BBa_K1615093)
mRFP (BBa_K1615089) fused to the C terminal of dCBD + N terminal linker (BBa_K1321340). If folded properly, this allows mRFP to fluoresce while immobilised on cellulose.
To test the RFP folding when fused to a CBD we placed 200µL of crude cell lysate in a 96 well plate and observed the fluorescence under a blue light transilluminator.
