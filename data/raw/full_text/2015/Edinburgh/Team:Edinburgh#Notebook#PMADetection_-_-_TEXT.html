PMA Detection
Week 1
Take Peroxidase out of the registry.
Order MaoA in two parts, N and C terminals.
Week 2
16/06
Digest pSB1C3 (1.23O2), pSB1A3 (4.2H1) and pSB1K3 (4.6B1) with EcoRI HF and PstI. Digest MaoA N and MaoA C (EcoRI HF/PstI).
Gel purify backbones, PCR purify inserts. Nanodrop.
17/06
Ligate MaoA N 1 to pSB1C3, MaoA N 2 to pSB1K3, and MaoA C to pSB1A3. Transform.
18/06
Growth appears on all plates (except for negative control). Less growth on the plates with backbone only which indicates that some of the insert ligated into the vector. Culture 3 colonies from each plate.
19/06
Miniprep cultures. Nanodrop.
Diagnostic digest to show if inserts are actually present. pSB1K3 seems to have false positives.
Week 4
22/06
Prepare miniprep products (MaoA N1 and MaoA C) for sequencing.
Week 5
29/06
Digest MaoA N1 1 in pSB1C3 and MaoA C 1 in pSB1A3 for fusion. PCR purify pSB1C3+MaoA N, gel purify MaoA C. Nanodrop.
Ligate pSB1C3+MaoA N to MaoA C overnight.
30/06
Transform ligation reactions.
01/07
All of the transformations appeared to have worked. Culture transformations
02/07
Miniprep cultures. Nanodrop.
Send pSB1C3+ MaoA N+MaoA C 1 and 2 for sequencing.
Run a diagnostic digest on them.
Diagnostic digest shows that MaoA N and C did not fuse, as together they should be around 2.3 kb and the insert is much smaller, closer to 1 kb which is the size of MaoA N alone.
Culture 4 more colonies from pSB1C3+MaoA N+MaoA C to see if there was successful fusion in any of them.
03/07
Miniprep the cultures. Nanodrop.
Run diagnostic digest to see if the fusion worked.
Diagnostic gel shows that the fusion did not work.
Week 6
07/07
Retry fusing MaoA together. Digest pSB1C3 +MaoA N (AgeI/SpeI) and pSB1A3+MaoA C (NgoMIV/SpeI). Treat pSB1C3+ MaoA N with Antarctic phostphatase.
Gel purify. Nanodrop.
Ligate MaoA C into pSB1C3+MaoA N.
08/07
Transform ligation results to see if MaoA fused.
09/07
No growth on plates which indicates that MaoA did not fuse.
Try fusion again by going back to the gBlock. Digest pSB1C3+MaoA N (AgeI/SpeI) and the MaoA C gBlock (NgoMIV/SpeI). Treat pSB1C3+MaoA N with Antarctic Phosphatase. Ligate the two together. Transform the ligation.
10/07
No colonies on control plates (backbone only), quite a few colonies on plates of backbone plus insert which indicates fusion of MaoA.
12/07
Inoculate colonies of transformants.
Week 7
13/07
Miniprep the two colonies with potential fusion of MaoA. Nanodrop.
Diagnostic digest the plasmids to fully ensure fusion of MaoA.
14/07
Sequence MaoA 1 and MaoA 2.
Week 8
27/07
Inoculate more colonies from the plate with pSB1C3+MaoA fusion.
28/07

09/08
Inoculate transformants.
Week 10
10/08

11/08
Sequence MaoA 4(1) and MaoA 4(2).
14/08
Insert LacI into pSB1C3+MaoA 4. Digest LacI with EcoRI/SpeI, and MaoA with EcoRI/XbaI. Phosphatase treat, ligate and transform into E.coli Top10s.
16/08
Inoculate successful transformants.
