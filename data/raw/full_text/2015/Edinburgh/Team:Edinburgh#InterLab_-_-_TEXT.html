Overview
The Edinburgh iGEM 2015 team is participating in the second year of the iGEM InterLab study along with 82 other teams. The 2015 InterLab study focuses on obtaining consistent fluorescence data for three genetic devices expressing GFP. The devices consist of a constitutive promoter with either high (J23101), medium (J23106) or low (J23117) promoter strengths, fused to GFP (I13504).
The promoters and GFP from the Biobrick distribution kit were transformed into E.coli Top10 cells then digested to have complementary sticky ends and ligated resulting in the final devices. The devices were validated by restriction digest and sequence data. Each promoter fused to GFP was transformed once more grown in cultures overnight and then measurements of fluorescence were taken.
More detailed information regarding the cloning process can be found below and on our InterLab lab notebook page.
Protocols
All other protocols used in the process of the study can be found on the protocols page.
What protocol was followed for growing cells for measurement?
The protocol supplied in the iGEM 2015 InterLab Protocol  form was followed with a few minor changes.
Each device and the two controls were streaked out onto LB agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 37°C for 22 hours.  3 colonies from each plate were inoculated into 50ml Falcon tubes containing 10ml of LB media and chloramphenicol.  The tubes were incubated upright on a platform shaker in a room kept at 37°C for 16 hours.
What controls were used?
The positive control used was the recommended BBa_I20270, a chloramphenicol resistant GFP expression device in pSB1C3.
The negative control used consisted of cells transformed with BioBrick number BBa_R0040. This part consists of the promoter pTetR and should therefore have very low fluorescence
What agar was used to grow the cells?
The cells were grown on LB agar supplemented with 1000x chloramphenicol.
How were the cells prepared for measurement?
A colony of cells was inoculated into 10ml of liquid LB with 10µl of 1000x chloramphenicol. The cultures were grown in a 50ml falcon tube, upright on shaking platform at 275rpm in 37°C room overnight.
For each device three colonies were inoculated to act as the three biological replicates.
How was the fluorescence of each device measured? (followed protocol)
After the overnight incubation period of 16 hours the liquid cultures were removed from the 37°C room. 200µl from each culture was added to a 96-well plate. The initial optical density of each sample was measured at 600nm using a plate reader. All samples were then diluted appropriately so as to have an OD600 value within 5% of 0.5.  Two additional technical replicates for each of the biological replicates were set up at this point. The OD600 was measured again to ensure all samples had an optical density within 5% of 0.5 before the fluorescence measurements were taken.
To measure fluorescence, the cells were excited at a wavelength of 485nm and emitted light at 538nm as measured.
The values obtained for fluorescence were in relative fluorescence units.
What instrument was used to measure the fluorescence of each device?
A SpectaMax M5 plate reader was used to obtain the values of fluorescence.
Results
How was the raw data processed?
The background absorbance of 6 wells containing 200µl of LB was measured.  The average of these readings was then subtracted from the fluorescence values obtained for the devices.
What were the units of the results?
The data is in relative fluorescent units.
