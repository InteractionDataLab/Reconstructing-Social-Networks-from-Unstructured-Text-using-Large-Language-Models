SPONSORS
This fall, Tufts Synthetic Biology has partnered with the Tufts Biology Department to offer a full credit, pass/fail course to expose prospective iGEM students to the essential theories and practices of synthetic biology. Although developed by current iGEM members, lectures are delivered by Dr. Kate Mirkin of the Biology Department and Dr. Nikhil Nair of the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. It will also feature guests lectures from experts in the fields of bacteriophage engineering, biomedical research, genetic circuitry, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The class will culminate in a group project that asks students to envision and design a biological system to address a real-world problem. The course is already underway with 10 very engaged and inquisitive students.
Seminar in Synthetic Biology
Fall 2015 | Pass/Fail | 1 Credit
Mondays/Wednesdays 1:30 - 2:45
BIO 196-06
Introduction to the basics of synthetic biology and the design and development of research proposals, led in part by     undergraduate members of Tufts’ Synthetic Biology team with faculty guidance. Overview of essential molecular     biology principles, using primary literature and software. Topics include DNA assembly, protein purification, cell     culture, genetic and metabolic engineering, biological circuits and the creation of synthetic life, and the broader     technological and ethical implications of synthetic biology. Proposals written in class may be carried out in lab and     possibly entered in the international synthetic biology competition (iGEM). Pass/Fail. 1 credit.
Expectations and Goals
It is expected that each student will attend and participate in each class. At the end of the semester, each student will     submit his or her own research proposal on the topic of their choosing and present the proposal to the class. Through     this course, students will learn the basics of synthetic biology and understand how to develop a research proposal.
Grading: Pass/Fail
 Participation: 40% -- This includes asking and answering questions, discussing your ideas and opinions about research     papers with the class or smaller groups, and debating proposal ideas.
 Attendance: 30% -- Two missed classes are permitted without reason. Any more than that and the attendance grade     will drop 10% for every missed class. Two late classes equals as one missed class.
 Proposal: 30% -- Outline for the proposal paper and presentation is below.
 o Written proposal: 20%
 o Proposal presentation: 10%
Course Materials
Required Text
 Regenesis by George Church
Recommended Text
If you would like to learn more about synthetic biology, these two books are great resources We will be reading two chapters from the first.
 Synthetic Biology: A Primer by Geoff Baldwin, et al.

All research papers will be uploaded to Trunk.
Journal Club
Students will be split into three groups, and each group will present for one of the three journal club days.

Proposal
Proposal Paper
The proposal paper should be written in groups of 2 or 3. The paper should be between 15 and 20 pages long, double spaced, including figures. The sections for the paper are: Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Rationale, Expected Results, Applications, Literature Cited. It will constitute 2/3rd of the overall proposal grade.
Proposal Presentation
The proposal presentation should be completed after the paper is written. It should last about 15 minutes and give a brief overview of all sections of the proposal, including relevant figures. The presentation is 1/3rd of the overall proposal grade.
