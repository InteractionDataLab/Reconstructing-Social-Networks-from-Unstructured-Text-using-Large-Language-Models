Although developed by current iGEM members, lectures are delivered by Dr. Kate Mirkin of the Biology Department and Dr. Nikhil Nair of the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. It will also feature guests lectures from experts in the fields of bacteriophage engineering, biomedical research, genetic circuitry, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The class will culminate in a group project that asks students to envision and design a biological system to address a real-world problem. The course is already underway with 10 very engaged and inquisitive students.

   Introduction to the basics of synthetic biology and the design and development of research proposals, led in part by 
   undergraduate members of Tufts’ Synthetic Biology team with faculty guidance. Overview of essential molecular 
   biology principles, using primary literature and software. Topics include DNA assembly, protein purification, cell 
   culture, genetic and metabolic engineering, biological circuits and the creation of synthetic life, and the broader 
   technological and ethical implications of synthetic biology. Proposals written in class may be carried out in lab and 
   possibly entered in the international synthetic biology competition (iGEM). Pass/Fail. 1 credit.<H4> Expectations and Goals </H4>
   It is expected that each student will attend and participate in each class. At the end of the semester, each student will 
   submit his or her own research proposal on the topic of their choosing and present the proposal to the class. Through 
   this course, students will learn the basics of synthetic biology and understand how to develop a research proposal.<H4> Grading: Pass/Fail</H4>
    Participation: 40% -- This includes asking and answering questions, discussing your ideas and opinions about research 
   papers with the class or smaller groups, and debating proposal ideas. 
    Attendance: 30% -- Two missed classes are permitted without reason. Any more than that and the attendance grade 
   will drop 10% for every missed class. Two late classes equals as one missed class. 
    Proposal: 30% -- Outline for the proposal paper and presentation is below.  o Written proposal: 20% o Proposal presentation: 10%<H4>Course Materials</H4><H5>Required Text</H5>
    <I>Regenesis</I> by George Church<H5>Recommended Text</H5>
     If you would like to learn more about synthetic biology, these two books are great resources We will be reading two chapters from the first. 
    <I>Synthetic Biology: A Primer</I> by Geoff Baldwin, et al.
    <I>Synthetic Biology: Tools and Applications</I> by Huimin Zhao<H5>Other Materials</H5>
   All research papers will be uploaded to Trunk.<H4> Journal Club </H4>
   Students will be split into three groups, and each group will present for one of the three journal club days. <H4> Speaker Schedule </H4><TABLE class="table table-hover"><THEAD><TR><TD width="15%"><CENTER><B> Date    </B></CENTER></TD><TD width="20%"><CENTER><B> Speaker </B></CENTER></TD><TD width=""><CENTER><B> Lesson  </B></CENTER></TD><TD width=""><CENTER><B> Work Due</B></CENTER></TD></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>Wed 9/9/15</TD><TD><A href="http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/faculty/mirkinKate/index.htm"> Kate Mirkin </A></TD><TD>Lecture: DNA (basic chemistry)</TD><TD>None</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 9/14/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: DNA (applications)</TD><TD>Read chapters 1 and 2 of <I> Regenesis</I>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 9/16/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: Research paper reading workshop</TD><TD>Read the paper to be discussed.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 9/21/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: RNA</TD><TD>Read chapters 3 and 4 of <I> Regenesis</I>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 9/23/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: Proteins</TD><TD>Read chapters 5 and 6 of <I> Regenesis</I>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 9/28/15</TD><TD><A href="http://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-us/people/karen-vagts"> Karen Vagts </A> presentation;  Proposal day: Introduction to proposals.</TD><TD>Read chapter 7 of <I> Regenesis</I>.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 9/30/15</TD><TD><A href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/synthetic-biology-group-robert-citorik/">Robert Citorik</A></TD><TD>Engineering bacteriophage for antibiotic resistant bacteria. </TD><TD>Read guest lecture paper.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 10/5/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: Proteins</TD><TD>Read chapter 8 of Regenesis.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 10/7/15</TD><TD>Proposal day: Discuss/work on ideas to help choose best option.</TD><TD>3 proposal ideas, 0.5 pages each</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 10/12/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: Host systems (prokaryotes)</TD><TD>Read chapter 9 of Regenesis.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 10/14/15</TD><TD><A href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jifa_Qi">Jifa Qi</A></TD><TD>Engineering bacteriophage to create nanomaterials.</TD><TD>Read guest lecture paper.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mon 10/19/15</TD><TD>Kate Mirkin</TD><TD>Lecture: Host systems (eukaryotes)</TD><TD>Read chapter 10 of Regenesis.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Wed 10/21/15</TD><TD>Journal Club 1: Discuss research paper</TD><TD>Read research paper.
