NEGEM 2015
We would like to thank the BU iGEM Team for organizing the two NEGEM conferences and providing an environment for collaboration and feedback.
Cell Lines
The Fuhrman Lab at Tufts University kindly provided JM109 cells used for general cloning purposes.
The Kritzer Lab at Tufts University kindly provided Rosetta-gami 2 cells.
The Nair Lab at Tufts University kindly provided BL21(DE3) E. coli.
The Sun Lab at Tufts Veterinary School kindly provided Bacillus megaterium cells.
Technical Insight
Dr. Nikhil Nair served as advisor for Tufts iGEM and provided assistance in scientific and administrative matters.
Dr. Lauren Linton provided guidance, put the team in contact with knowledgable resources, and helped coordinate our funding and access to equipment.
Dr. Linc Sonenshein provided advice for the project.
Dr. Xingmin Sun provided the atcdB plasmid, Bacillus megaterium cells, and relevant protocols including the transformation of B. megaterium cells.
Dr. Joshua Kritzer provided his expert opinion on design considerations relating to protein expression and design.
Dr. Charles Shoemaker provided advice for the project.
Dr. David Walt was an early advisor to the team, reviewed the proposals, and gave technical insight for the projects.
Lab Space
We would like to thank the Tufts Department of Biology for allowing Tufts iGEM to use its lab space and communal equipment. We would especially like to thank Michael Grossi for his assistance in this respect.
