Project ---ExTermite Coli---
Project
ExTermite Coli is a new system to exterminate termites.
It is composed of two parts, pseudo egg and engineered E. coli.
The exterminateon of termites by ExTermite Coli involves three steps ( Figure…)：
1. Engineered E. coli is carried into the termite’s colony.
The engineered E.coli also get into the termite’s gut.
2. The engineered E. coli inhibits metabolic pathway of the termite,
which in the long-term extermination of them.
3. After extermination of the termites, ExTermite Coli loses its function by light-induced lysis.
The details about each of the mechanisms and the related experiments are shown in the each of the link page.
