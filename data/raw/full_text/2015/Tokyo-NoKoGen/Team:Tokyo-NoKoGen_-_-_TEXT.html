The exterminateon of termites by ExTermite Coli involves three steps.
We use “pseudo egg” to distribute the engineered E.coli.  Using this unique tool, the engineered E.coli carried into the  termite’s body.
In the termite’s body, it  produces toxic material to inhibit the metabolic pathway of the termites and exterminate termites.  After extermination of the termites, ExTermite Coli loses its function by light-induced lysis.
On the project page, we explain about the details of our project, ExTermite Coli.
