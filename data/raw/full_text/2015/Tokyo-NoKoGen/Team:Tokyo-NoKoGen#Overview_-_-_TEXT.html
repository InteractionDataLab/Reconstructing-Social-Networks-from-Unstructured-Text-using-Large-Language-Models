Introduction
Do you know that termites cause serious damage ??
What kind   image do you have when you hear the word “termite”?? You may imagine some dirty insect. Some people  may go crazy if they think about it. Some people may think of the insect’s habit; they eat wood and paper, live in the dark, like humid space in a human’s house. We think very few people have a good image of the insect.
  These images are not so wrong. There are many problems around this insect.  First of all, they eat a lot of wood and paper; This is well known to people. But their voracity is unimaginable.  is beyond your images. Termites eat wood of all kinds, papers, and clothes that contain cellulose. They can eat the hard main pillar of a house, fluffy clothes, and also Kimtowels. The picture below shows a nearly collapsing house. It is damaged by a termite outbreak; thousands of termites have taken bites out of the poles.
No effective & safe pesticides for termites
You can see the enormous power of termites, furthermore, there is another problem. It is unfortunate  that there is no effective pesticides for termites. Of course, there are so many pesticides at a pharmacy or hardware store, but most of them contain neurotoxines. So they affect not only termites, but also humans. A survey of the neurotoxins in pesticides for termite. It shows that 18.3 % of the users claim some symptoms caused by pesticides, such as nausea, headache, stomachache, eczema, autonomic imbalance...!! Using pesticide may cause you serious symptoms.  Moreover, although it is true that these dangerous pesticides are quick-acting, they can not annihilate termites. To completely exterminate termites would require  a new pesticide that has a large effect also on the next generation.
This is further complicated by the fact that because it is very difficult to detect termites on account of their living in the recess of the house, you can not spray the pesticides directly.
Please imagine…
If termites live in your beautiful wooden house...and there may be a huge outbreak of termites in your lovely room….
Do you want to exterminate termites in your living space?
If you cannot exterminate them totally, do you want to use it ?
You may feel cold by thinking about it, but No Problem!!
Tokyo-NoKoGen developed new pesticides for Termites.
We developed a new system to exterminate termites, named ExTermite Coli.
There are three remarkable features of this new ExTermite Coli system.
 
・You can exterminate termites
As the name indicates, ExTermite Coli can exterminate termites. ExTermite Coli uses some enzymes to inhibit a metabolic pathway in termites. It has effect to not only adult insects , but also larvae, and eggs. Because of this feature, ExTermite Coli can annihilate termites.
・You can use it without any damage to your body
ExTermite Coli inhibits a metabolic pathway in insects only. It has no bad effect for human body because human body has different metabolic system. You can use ExTermite Coli without worrying.
・You can exterminate termites easily
With our ExTermite Coli, there is no need to locate the termite colonies. The termite themselves will gladly deliver ExTermite Coli to their colony.
