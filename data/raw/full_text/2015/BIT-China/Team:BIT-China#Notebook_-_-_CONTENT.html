					We started our project in March, and we have three parts of experiment, basic circuits part, regulation part and Error-prone PCR part. Basic circuits part was finished by Zongzhi Lv's group (including Hui Luo) and Wenxin Bai's group (including Changxin Zhang and Jiaqi Xu), Regulation part was finished by Jinlin Li's group (including Jiadong Zhong and Pengcheng Zhang). Error-prone PCR was finished by Jing Yang's group(including Chengyi Li, Mingming Cao, Xiao Peng and Zeyan Li). The experiments of Regulation part consist of the construction and verification of two pH-induce promoters (P-atp2 and P-asr) and recombinase system. The main work of error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) gruop is to select different promoters by error-prone PCR. The duty of Basic circuits group is to construct our basic resistance sub-system and basic regulation system.
