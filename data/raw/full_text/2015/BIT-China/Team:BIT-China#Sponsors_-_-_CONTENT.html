				Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) is a public university with a traditional focus on science and technology but developing into other areas such as management and humanities. The Institute emphasises ethics in scholarship, discovery of truth, and contribution to mankind through profound academic accomplishments.
			BIT was founded in 1940 in Yan’an, Shaanxi Province and was relocated to Beijing in 1949. In the following year, the main campus and the Departments of Maths, Physics and Chemistry of the Institute Franco-Chinois were merged with BIT.
			Engineering, materials science, chemistry, physics and mathematics are the five disciplines in BIT that are ranked among the top 1% in Essential Science Indicators (ESI) global ranking. Over the years, BIT is devoted to improving its research capabilities. </P><P style="width:50%;float:left;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
			High-level achievements have been made in navigation control, injury prevention and safety, mechanical and vehicle engineering, materials science, and information systems and warfare. It has developed a clear edge in technologies relating to intelligent and bionic robotics, space adaptive optics, green energy, modern communications and industrial process control.
			
			By taking a global approach to education, BIT is increasingly established as an internationally reputable and influential institution. Currently, it has established inter-university collaboration with more than 200 renowned universities in 58 countries and regions on six continents; it was the lead founder of the Sino-Spanish University Consortium and the Sino-Russian-Belarussian University Consortium and the co-founder of two Confucius Institutes: Confucius Institute of University of Lagos in Nigeria and Confucius Institute of University of Saskatchewan in Canada.
