The Georgia Tech iGEM Team is composed of 6 undergraduate students, 3 mentors, and 2 faculty advisors. We represent a diverse selection of Georgia Tech's students, with varying degrees of lab experience, different academic backgrounds, skill sets, interests, and passions. Success in the iGEM competition involves a wide range of talents that our team members were able bring to the table, and each student deserves to be recognized for their contributions.
