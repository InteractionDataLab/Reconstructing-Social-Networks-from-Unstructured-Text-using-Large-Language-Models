Gold
EITHER (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project that involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities.
We created the Georgia Tech iGEM Instructional Video Series. More information can be found here .
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We collaborated with Lambert High School. We took their interests into account and assisted them in setting reasonable goals for their summer. We helped them designing their project by proposing three constructs that became the foundation of their project. More information can be found here .
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
We validated that the part BBa_K1743011 works as expected.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.)
We have documented the BBa_K1743011 BioBrick to the iGEM Parts Registry.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
We presented at several biology, chemistry, and biotechnology classes to describe the goals of iGEM and introduce the field of synthetic biology. We also distributed informational pamphlets to spread the word about iGEM around our college campus and remind people to apply for next year's team.
Bronze
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
We are a registered iGEM team.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2015 Judging form.
We have completed the Judging Form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have created a Wiki page with a project description and submitted our parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have prepared a talk and poster for the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We have created an Attributions page on our Wiki.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
We have documented several BioBrick parts .
