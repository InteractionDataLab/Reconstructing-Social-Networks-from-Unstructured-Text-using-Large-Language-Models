Experiment Results
We are pleased to describe the results of our research endeavors! As a team, we:
Successfully mutated our starting proteins using error-prone PCR.
Achieved an error rate of about 0.2% - 0.5%.
Generated a diverse library of protein mutants to be used for future experiments.
Submitted mutated Plastocyanin gene sequences to the iGEM Parts Registry in standard BioBrick format.
