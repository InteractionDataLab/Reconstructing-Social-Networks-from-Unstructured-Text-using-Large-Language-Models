The actions we have taken to reduce the risk of catching on fire include wearing proper PPE and making sure never to go from flame to ethanol! We also make sure to destroy live cells with sodium hypochlorite before disposal in the proper containers. In addition, our lab uses a strong UV light to see and cut gels more clearly, however protective goggles are worn at all times.</P><H3>Biological Risks</H3><P>Below is a table that summarizes the vectors and strains that were used during the course of our research:</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Species Name</TH><TH>Risk Group</TH><TH>Risk Group Source</TH><TH>Pathogenic?</TH><TH>Part Number/Name</TH><TH>Company</TH><TH>How will you use it?</TH></TR><TR><TD><I>E.Coli</I> (DH5Î±<SUP>TM</SUP>)</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>MSDS</TD><TD>no</TD><TD><I>E.

Even though the CuAAC reaction has very specific substrates and conditions, the clickase enzyme could have unforeseen reactions with biological molecules, or it could compete with already-existing copper-binding proteins. Future work would include in-vivo studies.</P><H3>Safety Precautions</H3><P>At all times when working in the laboratory, our team members wore nitrile gloves, safety goggles, closed-toed shoes, protective lab coats, and long pants (PPE). Gloves were disposed of properly and hands were washed immediately after exiting the lab space. Experienced mentors (graduate researchers) were always around to assist in any situation that was in question.</P><P>Any waste that was to come into contact with a biologic was disposed of in its proper biohazard container and autoclaved. Also, any broken glass was disposed of in its proper sharps container.</P><H3>Researcher Safety</H3><P>All team members completed RCR (Responsible Conduct of Research) training through the CITI program, basic biohazard safety, fire safety, RTK (Right to Know) safety training, hazardous waste, recombinant DNA training, and blood-borne pathogen training.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
