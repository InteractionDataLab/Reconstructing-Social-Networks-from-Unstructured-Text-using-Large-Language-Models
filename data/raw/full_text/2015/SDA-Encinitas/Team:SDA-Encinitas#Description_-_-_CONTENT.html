As with many coastal habitats contamination is an issue.  Our project involves the design of a biological tool that is capable of detecting heavy metal waste in the waters of our local community. Our bacteria are designed to detect levels of heavy metals, specifically copper in aqueous systems using either the regulation mechanism for CopA and CusC genes. These two genes are normally up-regulated in the presence of aqueous copper ions. So, by replacing these genes with gfp, in response, our bacteria will glow green. This  will be detected by a our hand-built, programmed computer linked optical microscope. We will be quantitatively comparing the luminescence levels against standards and negative control, and will be collecting the samples from our local estuaries and aquatic reserves.</P><H4>References</H4><P>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research.
