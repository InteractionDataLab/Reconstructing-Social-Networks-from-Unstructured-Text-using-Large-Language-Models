                    In the Project Assessment of our Human Practices, we examined the database of CORE in order to find out the origins of the biological parts in the database of CORE (for the methods we adopted to do this examination, please click “<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Assessment">Human Practices/Risk Assessment</A>”).
                    Here we repeat the result we obtained. 
                    It is obvious that most of the parts in the database have no information on origins. This is because in Registry information of most of these parts is NOT complete; from Registry we can know little about where these parts come from. However, after we confirm these parts in the Registry, all of them contain no Red Flags.
                    Fortunately, for parts which we could find the origins of, most of them come from Escherichia coli. (Unfortunately still, in Registry they do not tell us whether they come from E. coli strain K-12.) After we confirm the Risk Group of these organisms with the <A href="https://www.dsmz.de/catalogues/catalogue-microorganisms.html">DSMZ database</A>, we found that in the database of CORE no KNOWN Risk Group 3 and Risk Group 4 organisms involved.

                  Design and simulation of genetic circuits are the functions of CORE. For some of the genetic circuits have been reported in previous journal papers, the safety of these well-known genetic circuits are well tested. And CORE adopts these circuits as raw materials for further design by users. When users utilize CORE to design new circuits or systems, they will be asked to consider about dangers of their designs. Our software provides a risk classified system which will give the Risk-Level Warning. There are four class in this system:<UL><LI>Low risk (1)</LI><LI>Moderate risk (2)</LI><LI>High risk (3) </LI><LI>Extreme risk (4)</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Biosafety"><H2>Biosafety in CORE Bank &amp; Co-development</H2><DIV id="Biosafety_block1"><DIV id="Biosafety_zuo" class="wenzi">
                As an open platform, CORE which allows every user to exchange and evaluate each other's ideas and design, subjects the biosafety issue of every design to everyone for evaluation. It is the potential use of Crowdsourcing in evaluating safety issues of the design.
                Users can make a detail safety assessment of each circuit or system and then rate the design. These ratings can be used to decide whether the circuits should be moved to the public.
                In addition to ratings, users can detail their remarks on safety in the Co-development module. Their remarks will help others to evaluate the safety issues of the design.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Warning"><H2>Warning after finishing the design</H2><P class="wenzi">Following the advice from our instructor, Prof. Yang, and the ideas from team member Xiaoran Yang, we added a warning into the CORE Design module so that we can remind the users of biosafety issue. Therefore, CORE can be responsible for its users and the users can be responsible for their design.</P></DIV><H1 id="hh">Biosafety in wet-lab</H1><P class="wenzi" id="pp">About the wet-lab for the validation of our software and the experiments for interlab study</P><DIV id="Consideration"><H2>Consideration of the circuit design</H2><DIV id="Consideration_block1"><DIV id="Consideration_zuo" class="wenzi">
                In the wet-lab part of our project, our circuit was designed with the help of our software. As all the parts in our software are in the white list, our circuit is 100 percent safe. Besides, we use the risk classified system in our software to assess our design. Photo.1 shows that our design is at a low risk level. Therefore, our circuit can be constructed.
                In the interlab study, we followed the instruction of safety level 1 procedures and design our experiment in an appropriate way.
