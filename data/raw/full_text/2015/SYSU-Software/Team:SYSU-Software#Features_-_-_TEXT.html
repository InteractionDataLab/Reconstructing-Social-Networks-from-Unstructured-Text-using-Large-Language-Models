Crowdsourcing for co-development.
CORE provides a proof-of-concept crowdsourcing platform for project co-development and communication. For complex genetic design, users can out-source part(s) of their constructs to other iGEMers or synthetic biologists to finish. CORE Design within CORE contains an user-friendly tool for genetic design.
Get inspirations from the Bank.
Tired of finding information on project in wiki?
Do not understand what other teams mean in their wiki?
CORE employs SBOL(v) standard for standardized deposit of genetic design.
With standardized documentation of genetic design, information retrieval and parsing become easier.
Start getting inspirations on CORE Bank and stand on the shoulder of the giants!
Easier experiments.
Wet-lab needs not only genetic designs. CORE interacts with Registry, and provides shortcuts to navigate parts. A refined modeling module helps predict the performance of your construct, as well as plots the results for you. If you start fabricating your construct, the Plasmid would help you. For wet-lab, protocol managements and experiment schedule can certainly help you.
Safer genetic design.
CORE cares about biosafety.
When designing circuits, you will know whether your circuit is safe.
The safety of your design can also be evaluated by everyone.
Crowdsourcing the evaluation of safety to the public!
Open and extendable.
Open communication in synbio. Open to extend. And open to give, get and share.
