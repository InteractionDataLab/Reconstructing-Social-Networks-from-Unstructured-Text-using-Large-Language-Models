Problems: Our Motivations
Software teams have an inborn connection to wet-lab teams’ needs.
1. Teams are encouraged to work together to tackle problems, but there is no platform that can supports collaborative building of genetic design in the community.
2. Teams are encouraged to “stand on the shoulder of the giants” while not to “re-invent the wheels”, but things goes not so smoothly.
3. Teams are busy working on experiments and in need of a integrated solutions to wet-lab, not only genetic design.
Solutions: Our Goals
A crowdsourcing platform that serves two inter-connected functions, to promote and facilitate communication and collaborations among iGEM teams, and to provide convenience to work on a genetic design, identify problems and characterize and improve the functions, collaboratively.
A standardized and centralized bank of projects of the past and future. This centralized bank could help improve transparency and reproducibility in iGEM by way of standard documentation of constructs and wet-lab protocols.
A tool for genetic design that serves to closely connect the two parts mentioned. Users can use the tool to re-design constructs and systems in the bank, and also to identify problems or improve functions in the constructs presented by other teams in the open platform.
The tool should provide an integrated solution to wet-lab: mathematical modeling using experimental results, plasmid design, experiment scheduling and protocol management.
Designs that stand the test of time should be able to migrate from the crowdsourcing platform to the bank.
Our Project: A Glimpse
Our project consists of two inter-connected parts:
“Synbio Hub”: a proof-of-principle platform for collaborative construction and standardized bank of genetic design. This part is further divided into two modules: CORE Bank, the bank, and Co-development, the crowdsourcing platform for collaborative design.
CORE Design: a well-designed tool for genetic design, mathematical modeling, plasmid design and experiment scheduling with protocol management.
"Synbio Hub" and CORE Design: Platform for community with useful integrations.
