                    During the summer, a meetup was held in Sun Yat-sen University. There were wet-lab teams (SCUT-China, SCUT and SYSU-China), a software team (SYSU-Software) as well as high-school teams (SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX). 
                    In the meetup we talked about the relationships between software teams and wet-lab teams. Zhengyang Wen and Shengkun Dai, team members of us, gave advice on project design to  members of high-school teams SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX. Wen and Dai taught them how to discover the needs of wet-lab teams, and gave them advice on how to design software that meets the needs of wet-lab teams. Also, we gave 
                    them instructions on scheduling the project.

                    In spring, we held a garden party in the campus with SYSU_CHINA. This activity aimed at introducing synthetic biology to the public, and engaging the public in the practices of iGEM. In the garden party, we made use of various kinds of activities and games to introduce the basic ideas of Synbio and iGEM. SYSU_CHINA introduced how experimental iGEMers did great jobs in a living cells, while we talked about how software can help explore the extraordinary world of life made up of DNA.
