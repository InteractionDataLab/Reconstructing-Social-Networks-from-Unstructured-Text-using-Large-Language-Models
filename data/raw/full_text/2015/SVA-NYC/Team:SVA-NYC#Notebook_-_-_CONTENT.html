 </P><H3>WET LAB 2:</H3><P>5/25 -  Research led to the possibility of using microfluidics</P></DIV></DIV><H2> Week 3</H2><H3>DRY LAB 3:</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10"><P>
- Team members presented their research on assigned soil nutrients to the group.
- Looked at an app that tests soil.
- Discussed the legalities of sampling: taking samples in public is going to need more formalities. Personal spaces and community gardens will be a more realistic place to begin sampling.
- Plotted iGEM deadlines onto a calendar.
- Ordered 6 soil augers, spray bottles, tape measures, location markers, etc. for collecting samples.
- After reviewing the SDS sheets for the LaMotte kit reagents we discussed chemical hygiene and trained new team members on our lab protocol.</P><P>
After realizing just how toxic the kit is, the team continued to brainstorm about non-toxic sensors. Ideally we will find biological substitutes for LaMotte soil tests - if that is not an option we can greatly decrease the amount of the substance needed for testing, by using a microchannel chip and spectrophotometer, possibly interfaced into a device for a smart phone.
 </P><P>
Sebastian explained that exposure time for the biosensors we make would not be an instant result, like the LaMotte kit, but need at minimum a few hours to process. We also discussed how (some of) the biosensors function to change colors- once they bind the to soil sample the molecules change shape, therefore changing the way the light refracts which makes the color visible.
 </P><H3>NEXT MEETING:</H3><P>
We will test out the LaMotte soil kit for the first time as a group.</P><P>
Need to make a map of community gardens and draft a letter to introduce our project and ask for access. How do we encourage citizen participation? Offer participants a survey of data pertaining to their soil.</P><H3>WET LAB 3:</H3><P>6/2 -  Found Arsenic activated biosensor in biobrick registry</P></DIV></DIV><H2> Week 4</H2><H3>DRY LAB 4:</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10"><P>
Sebastian leads a demonstration on how to use the LaMotte Soil Kit to test a soil sample for different nutrients, starting with the process of filtering nutrients from soil into container with liquid extraction. We discussed possible ways to streamline and expedite the slow drip extraction, while keeping in mind we must use individual containers and utensils for each sample to AVOID CROSS-CONTAMINATION. Miniature French presses? Centerfuge?
</P><P>
After performing LaMotte nutrient tests, several issues were discovered:
- Some nutrients produced very small quantities, too little to fill cuvette.
- Due to subjectivity in the perception of colored results, it was difficult to read precise amounts for each nutrient. Several tests, like the one involving a black line and shade of grey, exacerbated this problem.</P><P>
A handful of team members took augers home to get samples from their yards. Next week we will hear feedback from those that used the augers and begin drafting protocol and assembling a kit for sample taking: including recording of gps/time/temp, etc. Environmental limitations: nearby buildings, trees, dog pee, rain within 48 hours.
</P><H3>WET LAB 4:</H3><P>
6/08 - Transformed mRFP1 from kit-4 well-2F (&quot;SVA 1&quot;).
6/10 - Preliminary testing of La Motte soil kit.
6/11 - Majority of biobrick registry research to create potential cassettes.</P></DIV></DIV><H2> Week 5</H2><H3>DRY LAB 5:</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10"><P>
Victor talks about the acquisition of his samples, the type of soil, the process, and his reflection upon the experience of extraction:
- Need the address or geotag location of every collected sample for verification purposes.
- Between each sampling of soil, it is important to clean the auger with DISTILLED WATER, as tap water has trace elements and minerals that may get absorbed into the soil of the next sample, providing false or altered readings.
- When not in use soil should be stored in dark spaces with the bag open, to prevent photobleaching and allow aeration.
- Sebastian blows everyone's mind with science when he casually mentions the &quot;dew&quot; that forms in the plastic bags of soil when they are sealed is not caused by humidity, but by BACTERIA!
- A scientist and a photographer try to agree on how to standardize and optimize the process of photographing the samples and results.
- The Universal Extraction Buffer (used in many of these nutrient tests) is essentially vinegar. It NEUTRALIZES the alkalinity of the sample to even out the pH. This process leads to an opaque reaction that forms a PRECIPITATE that will not dissolve. Because of this, the color will remain. Just keep refrigerated.
- The sample requires a relative reading. I.e. any lighting can be used, so long as the sample and the control are read (or photographed) at the same time.
- The white flakes from a fresh fire are called Pot Ash. It's another name for Potassium.</P><H3>NEXT WEEK:</H3><P>
- Start drafting outreach email to faculty and students that have back yard access.
- Draft list of places we can post open invitational flyers.
- Make list of potential sponsors and contact.</P><H3>WET LAB 5:</H3><P>

6/17 - Miniprepped SVA 2</P></DIV></DIV><H2> Week 6</H2><H3>DRY LAB 6:</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10"><P>
- Drafted an ‘all concerned’ email blast to SVA community, which will be sent out this week.
- Discussed the pros and cons of letting random participants take the samples, instead of sending a team member to the location. Consensus is that coordinating and instructing outsiders to take the samples wouldn’t be any less work and could potentially jeopardize our data.
- We looked at all the different sections we will eventually have published on our site and determined which sections we currently have content for and who will manage. We will host the content in google drive until it has been greenlighted. Tarah will make a shared website folder for content. Raul drafted a spreadsheet to manage website content.
- Updates to our project description - focus our efforts on community gardens and backyards in our urban environment.
- Missed opportunities to connect with community garden contacts and we all agreed (approved) letter addressed to sites of interest should be a priority for the next meeting, as reaching out requires waiting on others to respond.
- Discussed how to get the most pure and accurate sample from a single site. We do not have the resources to test each site multiple times, however- we could take multiple samples from each site, and process the combination of samples to get an average.
- Sebastian and Tarah drafted responses to an iGEM survey about our lab and about our project.
- Made our very first iGEM submission deadline on 06/26/25!
- Jen updated us on her progress of converting the LaMotte sample forms into 2 separate custom forms for our project- one designated for out in the field and another for processing back in the lab. Jen has been drafting standardized answers to select from as well as creating a visual guide of different types of soil. Steph recommended instead of printing pictures of soil on each form have a laminated photo card in each kit.
 </P><H3>NEXT MEETING:</H3><P>
- Review everyone’s 100 word bio and take individual head shots of the group for the team page.
- Gather all available info and images and continue sorting into website folders to create a workflow of approving and adding content to the website.
