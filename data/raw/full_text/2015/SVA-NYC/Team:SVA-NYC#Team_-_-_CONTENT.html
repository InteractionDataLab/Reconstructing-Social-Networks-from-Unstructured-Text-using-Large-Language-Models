    Andrew Jozseph Cziraki is a Manhattan based artist currently earning his BFA at SVA. Previously he constructed visual art in a traditional manor, but once attending SVA he began transitioning into many different mediums such as, sound, video, scientific experimentation and technological art.  His work focuses on a theme of the imprints of humanity left on physical or psychological environments.  These themes relate to sub-conscious and conscious excrement discarded by the human organism.  Another interest he engages in is the presence of natural hallucinations associated to visual or oral phenomenon.

   Darya Warner came to US from Belarus in 2001  and was determined to pursue her dream of being an artist. Her work revolves around the complexity of nature and global environmental consciousness, in which living organisms are  the quintessential part of Darya's ideas. Through bio-processing and collaboration with living matter  (mycelium, bioluminescent algae, glowing E.Coli and other ) combined with usage of modern technologies (CNC machines) Darya creates interactive installations, visual displays, and sculptures to engage the viewer into becoming more aware of the world around us and push to rethink his/her  place as a ‘sapiens’ part of Earth’s Complex.
