Genetic Parts
Basic Parts
SVA12:  This is a composite part of SVA18 (strong RBS) after SVA6 (ArsR).  Originally intended for SVA3 instead of SVA18, but complications with SVA3 led to use of SVA18 instead.  The RBS was placed after the ArsR domain before adding a fluorescent indicator.
SVA13:  This is a composite part of SVA4 (double terminator) placed after SVA5 (mCherry).  Adding a terminator after mCherry would allow for subsequent ligation to as the indicator behind a sensory domain.
SVA15:  This is a composite part of SVA7 (RBS+aeBlue) before SVA4 (double terminator).  It completes the indicator portion of aeBlue for subsequent addition to a sensory domain.
SVA19: This is a composite of SVA7 before SVA4- it is this same as SVA15.  It differs from SVA15 by using a newer batch of competent cells in attempt to determine why aeBlue yields no fluorescence.
SVA16: This is a composite part of SVA7 (RBS+aeBlue) after SVA14 (LacI promoter).  The LacI promoter was added to aeBlue to verify its functionality as a colorimetric indicator.  The results were unsatisfactory, the aeBlue gene may be faulty.
SVA17: This is a composite part of SVA8 (RBS+eforRed) after SVA14 (LacI promoter).  The LacI promoter was added to eforRed to verify is functionality as a colorimetric indicator.  The results provided the chassis with significant amounts of fluorescence.
SVA20:  This is a composite part of SVA8 (RBS+eforRed) before SVA4 (double terminator).  It completes the indicator portions of eforRed for subsequent addition to a sensory domain.
SVA21:  This is a composite part of SVA16 (LacI promoter+RBS+aeBlue) before SVA4 (double terminator).  This part was created for sequencing to try and determine why aeBlue lacks fluorescence.
SVA22:  This is a composite part of SVA17 (LacI promoter+RBS+eforRed) before SVA4 (double terminator).  This part was created for sequencing to be compared to SVA21 to help determine SVA21’s difficulties.
SVA23:  This is a composite part of SVA3 (strong RBS) before SVA5 (mCherry).  This part was made to allow for subsequent addition of a terminator to be used as the indicator region.  This SVA3 came from reordering BBa_B0034 due to the previous batches complications.
Basic Parts
SVA1:  This part is a complete genetic circuit with a LacI promoter, Strong RBS, mRFP1, and double terminator made to verify the functionality of mRFP1 in the use of a biosensor.  This is all on a Ampicillin resistant backbone.  This circuit was simply transformed from BBa_J04450.
SVA2:  This part incorporates the Mer Operon, including: MerR, MerT, MerP, and MerA. This part should give the chassis Mercury resistance and give it a mercury-activated promoter region.  All of this is on Chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  This part was simply a transformation of BBa_K1355004.  The intended purpose of this part was to add a fluorescent marker after the Mercury sensing domain to make a functioning mercury sensor.
SVA3:  This part is only a strong RBS transformed from BBa_B0034 on an Ampicillin resistant backbone.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation for more complex circuits.
SVA4:  This part is only a double terminator from BBa_B0015 on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation for more complex circuits.
SVA5:   This part is only the region encoding for mCherry on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone; it is lacking a promoter, RBS and terminator.  It was transformed from BBa_J06504.  Its purpose was for subsequent restriction and ligation as the indicator to be attached to a sensory domain of a biosensor.
SVA6:  This part incorporates the ArsR from BBa_J3320, involving ArsR, an RBS and a Arsenic sensitive domain on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  It should provide the chassis with arsenic resistance and an arsenic activated promoter, which would be used for subsequent restriction and ligation of another RBS and fluorescent indicator to be added afterward.
SVA7:  This part incorporates a strong RBS and aeBlue, without a promoter or terminator on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone transformed from BBa_K11033929.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation as the fluorescent indicator to be attached to a sensory domain.
SVA8:  This part incorporates a weak RBS and eforRed, without a promoter or terminator on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone transformed from BBa_K1073023.  Its purpose is for subsequent restriction and ligation as the fluorescent indicator to be attached to a sensory domain.
SVA11:  This part is simply the pSB1A2 backbone to be used for subsequent restriction and ligation.
SVA14:  This part is a LacI promoter on a Chloramphenicol resistant backbone transformed from BBa_R0010.  The purpose of this part is for subsequent restriction and ligation as a constitutive promoter onto various fluorescent indicators to verify their functionality.
SVA18:  This part is an RBS on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone.  It was transformed from BBa_B0030.  Its purpose is to replace SVA3 which yielded several complications.
