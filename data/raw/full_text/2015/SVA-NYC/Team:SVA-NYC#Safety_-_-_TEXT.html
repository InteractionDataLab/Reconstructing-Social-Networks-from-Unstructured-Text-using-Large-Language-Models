Safety in iGEM
Safety and unnecessary exposure to hazardous reagents was the core interest and drive of our project. As artists that are navigating the laboratory space and learning about chemical hygiene protocols, we were surprised to discover that many soil testing kits require the use of toxic materials with little guidance on how to handle and dispose of the materials. After learning how to properly work with these reagents, we began brainstorming alternative means of reducing exposure.
The main risk in our project was exposure to hazardous reagents in the La Motte kit, which were used following chemical hygiene protocol under supervision. Students worked in designated areas with access to eyewash stations, fire blankets, first aid and spill kits. Safety gear such as gloves, surgical masks and goggles were required when needed. A plan was made for handling and waste management before reagents were utilized and team members were trained on interpretation of MSDS and chemical label information.
About our lab: The Bio Art Lab was founded in 2011 and is directed by Suzanne Anker, Chair of the BFA Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts.  We employ the tools and techniques of science to create works of art. Our laboratory is bio level 1 and is equipped with laminar flow hoods, chemical fume hoods, as well as open bench spaces. Our lab technicians follow OSHA and EPA standards. In our state (NY) the NIH guidelines have been recognized as law.
