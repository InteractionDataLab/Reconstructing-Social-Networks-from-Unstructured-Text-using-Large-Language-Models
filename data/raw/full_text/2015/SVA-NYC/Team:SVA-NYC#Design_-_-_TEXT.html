Soiled: Prototype device and Mobile App
By replacing the toxic chemical based laboratory standard of soil analysis with a colorimetric biological analog we can provide a safer alternative. Our plan is to produce a microfluidic chip that will house the necessary reagents, biological or otherwise. The microfluidic cartridge will be loaded into a portable device and integrated with compatible technologies, such as a phone and it’s case. The “color data” can be captured and measured by the phone’s camera, eliminating human error.
Soiled Bio Art Installation
In the Soiled installation we used an assortment of materials to depict the five boroughs of NYC, with a LED representing each of the locations we sampled. Using an Arduino we coded the network of LEDS to cycle through the results of the nutrients we tested for. The color of the LED indicates which nutrient was currently being displayed and the brightness of the LED correlates to the concentration of the nutrient at that specific site. This installation will be reinstalled at the School of Visual Arts gallery in Chelsea in early 2016 and we invite you all to attend.
