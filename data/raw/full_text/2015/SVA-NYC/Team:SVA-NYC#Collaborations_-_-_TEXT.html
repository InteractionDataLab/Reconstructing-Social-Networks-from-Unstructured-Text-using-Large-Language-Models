Collaborations
HKUST RICE University
Houston, TX
Their interest in producing biosensors for the “big three” plant nutrients especially using a cell-free expression system coincides with our ideal goal of producing a protein based colorimetric sensor system with hopes of immobilizing the protein in a portable microfluidic device for use in the field. We offered our facilities as a data validation collaboration where we would transform and characterize their systems using various strains across varied conditions but the delivery of the plasmids did not arrive until after the wiki freeze.
Genspace
Brooklyn, NY
The Genspace iGEM team offered to collaborate on characterizing an E. coli Nitrate Biosensor consisting of the YeaR promoter element driving a fluorescent protein and regulated by the NsrR repressor element that inhibits transcription in the absence of nitrates and nitrites. Unfortunately, the assembly of said part was not completed in time for us to test using our strains.
