Software
The arduino software our team used for the art installation is built on open source technologies. We are able to display the results of our data using inexpensive and easily accessible hardware by utilizing libraries created by developers from the DiY community. The software works in conjunction with the hardware by relating the concentrations of different elements found in the soil with the intensity of the light emitted by an array of LEDs, each of which represents a location sampled.
