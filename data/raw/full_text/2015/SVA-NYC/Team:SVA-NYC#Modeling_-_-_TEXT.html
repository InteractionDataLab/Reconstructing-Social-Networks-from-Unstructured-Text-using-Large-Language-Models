Ferric Iron Standard Curve @ 483nm
Ferric Iron Standard
We produced a standard curve using the UV-Vis Spectrophotometer as per our standard protocol using a pure molecular homolog to the ion under test ranging from 0 to the maximum working concentration of the specific test. The internal working range was determined by the highest concentration attainable while still remaining linear. Since the equilibrium of the reaction will shift toward the soil extract, the reacting reagent will be exhausted thus will not yield a greater signal despite an increase in the standard concentration. Certain tests were limited in precision or unrealistic in terms of real world quantification of nutrients thus a simple relative reading was performed and the data were displayed as a comparison amongst all the soil plots versus the highest plot recorded.
A linear regression model was chosen since the chemical reactions in questions produce a one to one response proportional to the molecular concentration of the nutrient. A trend line was derived along with an R squared value to describe the strength of correlation. Error bars were produced to define the distance of deviation the observed values were from the linear model. The resulting equation was then used to compute the concentration of nutrients in each unknown soil sample as a function of the absorbance at a wavelength deemed most sensitive across the gradient of soil standards. The soil values were recorded in parts per million.
