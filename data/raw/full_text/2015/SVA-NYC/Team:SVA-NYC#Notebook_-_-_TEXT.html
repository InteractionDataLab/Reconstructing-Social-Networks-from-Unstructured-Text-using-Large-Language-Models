Week 1
DRY LAB 1:
For our first team meeting we distributed handouts, reviewed the Art & Design track guidelines and introduced a few project ideas.
We discussed preliminary research and possible manifestations of a project about testing soil, which included an iPhone case that coordinates with an app to process physical samples in the field and a large (weather like) map showing soil health in Manhattan.
Sites of interest for sampling soil: Parks, retro manufacturers, cemeteries, backyards. *Expand list and make map*
NEXT MEETING:
Check out project NOAH for soil. Also look into previous iGEM projects.
WET LAB 1:
5/18 - First iGEM syllabus meeting
5/19 - Preliminary research on nutrient activated promoter
Week 2
DRY LAB 2:
Distributed lab coats and iGEM pins
Team members signed up for iGEM usernames
Brainstormed project titles
Took group photo
Drafted list of subcommittees and preliminary tasks
Extended sample collecting to other boroughs
Emailed LaMotte handbook to team
Potential names for project:
“SOIL-SCAPE”
“Super Duper Soil SenSomatic!”
“DIRT-BOW”
“SOILED”
“Soil Spectrum”
“ChromaDirt”
Everyone will research their assigned soil topic as well as think about:
What is the definition of soil? The chemicals used in the testing of soil nutrients are toxic- what are non-toxic solutions? is soil toxic? what nutrients are present? can you neutralize soil? what is soil health?

WET LAB 2:
5/25 -  Research led to the possibility of using microfluidics
Week 3
DRY LAB 3:
- Team members presented their research on assigned soil nutrients to the group.
- Looked at an app that tests soil.
- Discussed the legalities of sampling: taking samples in public is going to need more formalities. Personal spaces and community gardens will be a more realistic place to begin sampling.
- Plotted iGEM deadlines onto a calendar.
- Ordered 6 soil augers, spray bottles, tape measures, location markers, etc. for collecting samples.
- After reviewing the SDS sheets for the LaMotte kit reagents we discussed chemical hygiene and trained new team members on our lab protocol.
After realizing just how toxic the kit is, the team continued to brainstorm about non-toxic sensors. Ideally we will find biological substitutes for LaMotte soil tests - if that is not an option we can greatly decrease the amount of the substance needed for testing, by using a microchannel chip and spectrophotometer, possibly interfaced into a device for a smart phone.
Sebastian explained that exposure time for the biosensors we make would not be an instant result, like the LaMotte kit, but need at minimum a few hours to process. We also discussed how (some of) the biosensors function to change colors- once they bind the to soil sample the molecules change shape, therefore changing the way the light refracts which makes the color visible.
NEXT MEETING:
We will test out the LaMotte soil kit for the first time as a group.
Need to make a map of community gardens and draft a letter to introduce our project and ask for access. How do we encourage citizen participation? Offer participants a survey of data pertaining to their soil.
WET LAB 3:
6/2 -  Found Arsenic activated biosensor in biobrick registry
Week 4
DRY LAB 4:
Sebastian leads a demonstration on how to use the LaMotte Soil Kit to test a soil sample for different nutrients, starting with the process of filtering nutrients from soil into container with liquid extraction. We discussed possible ways to streamline and expedite the slow drip extraction, while keeping in mind we must use individual containers and utensils for each sample to AVOID CROSS-CONTAMINATION. Miniature French presses? Centerfuge?
After performing LaMotte nutrient tests, several issues were discovered:
- Some nutrients produced very small quantities, too little to fill cuvette.
- Due to subjectivity in the perception of colored results, it was difficult to read precise amounts for each nutrient. Several tests, like the one involving a black line and shade of grey, exacerbated this problem.
A handful of team members took augers home to get samples from their yards. Next week we will hear feedback from those that used the augers and begin drafting protocol and assembling a kit for sample taking: including recording of gps/time/temp, etc. Environmental limitations: nearby buildings, trees, dog pee, rain within 48 hours.
WET LAB 4:
6/08 - Transformed mRFP1 from kit-4 well-2F ("SVA 1").
6/10 - Preliminary testing of La Motte soil kit.
6/11 - Majority of biobrick registry research to create potential cassettes.
Week 5
DRY LAB 5:
Victor talks about the acquisition of his samples, the type of soil, the process, and his reflection upon the experience of extraction:
- Need the address or geotag location of every collected sample for verification purposes.
- Between each sampling of soil, it is important to clean the auger with DISTILLED WATER, as tap water has trace elements and minerals that may get absorbed into the soil of the next sample, providing false or altered readings.
- When not in use soil should be stored in dark spaces with the bag open, to prevent photobleaching and allow aeration.
- Sebastian blows everyone's mind with science when he casually mentions the "dew" that forms in the plastic bags of soil when they are sealed is not caused by humidity, but by BACTERIA!
- A scientist and a photographer try to agree on how to standardize and optimize the process of photographing the samples and results.
- The Universal Extraction Buffer (used in many of these nutrient tests) is essentially vinegar. It NEUTRALIZES the alkalinity of the sample to even out the pH. This process leads to an opaque reaction that forms a PRECIPITATE that will not dissolve. Because of this, the color will remain. Just keep refrigerated.
- The sample requires a relative reading. I.e. any lighting can be used, so long as the sample and the control are read (or photographed) at the same time.
- The white flakes from a fresh fire are called Pot Ash. It's another name for Potassium.
NEXT WEEK:
- Start drafting outreach email to faculty and students that have back yard access.
- Draft list of places we can post open invitational flyers.
- Make list of potential sponsors and contact.

6/17 - Miniprepped SVA 2
Week 6
DRY LAB 6:
- Drafted an ‘all concerned’ email blast to SVA community, which will be sent out this week.
- Discussed the pros and cons of letting random participants take the samples, instead of sending a team member to the location. Consensus is that coordinating and instructing outsiders to take the samples wouldn’t be any less work and could potentially jeopardize our data.
- We looked at all the different sections we will eventually have published on our site and determined which sections we currently have content for and who will manage. We will host the content in google drive until it has been greenlighted. Tarah will make a shared website folder for content. Raul drafted a spreadsheet to manage website content.
- Updates to our project description - focus our efforts on community gardens and backyards in our urban environment.
- Missed opportunities to connect with community garden contacts and we all agreed (approved) letter addressed to sites of interest should be a priority for the next meeting, as reaching out requires waiting on others to respond.
- Discussed how to get the most pure and accurate sample from a single site. We do not have the resources to test each site multiple times, however- we could take multiple samples from each site, and process the combination of samples to get an average. - Sebastian and Tarah drafted responses to an iGEM survey about our lab and about our project.
- Made our very first iGEM submission deadline on 06/26/25!
- Jen updated us on her progress of converting the LaMotte sample forms into 2 separate custom forms for our project- one designated for out in the field and another for processing back in the lab. Jen has been drafting standardized answers to select from as well as creating a visual guide of different types of soil. Steph recommended instead of printing pictures of soil on each form have a laminated photo card in each kit.
NEXT MEETING:
- Review everyone’s 100 word bio and take individual head shots of the group for the team page.
- Gather all available info and images and continue sorting into website folders to create a workflow of approving and adding content to the website.
- Finalize forms for sampling and processing soil.

Week 14
DRY LAB 14:
- Sketch of soil map of New York City is agreed to be a relevant focus for the creative team.
- Several discussions on concepts emerged.
- Restricted on designing an installation, as there is limited information of the gallery space, dimensions and lighting provided at the jamboree. What we do know is that any soil and chemicals cannot cross state boundaries limiting possibilities for installation materials. Ask iGEM HQ about commercial soil as an installation material.
- The idea of having our creative work designed and made for a New York Gallery (SVA Gallery) was proposed by Shane.
8/22 - Soil sample # 43 is collected
WET LAB 14:
We revised all of the LaMotte protocols to accommodate quantity of samples and volume required for filling cuvettes. We also set up an assembly line to extract the first 35 samples using funnels, filters, conical tubes and universal extraction buffer. Tests for Chloride and pH must be extracted with other solution.
Week 15
DRY LAB 15:
- Focused on concepts of testing soil in NYC, and how we can visually represent the data and process of the scientific work being done.
- Use LEDS to represent location, so information displayed is not static, but can cycle through different results.

8/25 - Soil samples # 48, 49 are collected
8/27 - Soil samples # 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 are collected
WET LAB 15:
- Created Standards and processed soil extraction for Nitrate, Potassium.
- After weeks of contacting suppliers we are a little concerned about getting refills on a few of the reagents needed to finish testing. LaMotte’s tablet pressing machine is out of order and none of the 32 retailers we contacted have any phosphorous tablets!
Week 16
DRY LAB 16:
We gathered to finalize possible installation ideas on how we can represent our final product. At this point all soil sampling is completed and so far we collected 55 samples total from all the boroughs.
Discussed visual representation of the all collected results: - 5 boroughs cutouts with an LED mapping according to location of the each sample.
- Incorporation of the human practices.
- Installation space logistics.

Created Standards and processed soil extraction for Chloride, Magnesium, Ammonia Nitrogen, Manganese, pH. We finally found some replacement phosphorous testing reagents in stock that should be here by the end of the week.
Week 17
DRY LAB 17:
- Installation team continues working on wiring installation, mapping out the LEDs, working on coding.
- Team is processing samples back in lab.
- Organizing all the soil samples images for further placement on the website.
- Archiving all the soil sample documentation.
- Mike and Raul continue to work on the website.
- We 3D printed the final draft of the prototype device, ultimately deciding to pursue a stage-like platform, rather than a phone case.
- Progress on design of microfluidic chip, still determining the best process to manufacture the chip using different ways to transfer the design onto the copper plates with photo-reactive film. The problems we are having are with the channels being neat and clean enough for the chip to function properly.
WET LAB 17:
Created Standards and processed soil extraction for:
Aluminum, Sulfate, Nitrite, Ferric Iron, Phosphorous and Calcium.
We had multiple issues with test results not being as stable as we had previously thought. Many test had to be redone, which has set us back on working on finishing content for the wiki. Many team members have been working nonstop to get everything re-tested and analyzed!
Week 18
DRY LAB 18:
The final week before Wiki Freeze and we are wrapping things up.
- Adding captions to our images.
- Finalizing Notebook and Human Practices.
- Composing time lapse videos of workflow.
- Compiling data from the spectrometer analyzation and converting it into graphs.
- Using the data to plot points on our installation map. Installation almost finished!
WET LAB 18:
Finalizing protocols for fabrication of microfluidic chip, partial etching of PCB boards providing the best results. Concentrated indicators for pH test to get more visibility in microfluidic channels.
Tucking a very dedicated iGEM team member into his makeshift bed of AstroTurf and sea sponge pillows after an all-nighter.
