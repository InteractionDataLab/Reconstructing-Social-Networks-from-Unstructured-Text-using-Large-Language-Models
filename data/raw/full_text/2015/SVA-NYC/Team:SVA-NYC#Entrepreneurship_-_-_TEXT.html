Entrepreneurship
The Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts is well poised with it’s own Bio Art lab. In the lab environmentally friendly soil analysis products are being investigated to replace existing, often toxic, products available on the market. SVA’s Bio Art’s initial product, constructed in conjunction with our own multi media installation, Soiled, is a microfluidic cartridge. It is a portable device geared towards the urban gardener for testing nutrients in soil samples.
The Opportunity
LaMotte is the leading firm involved in soil analysis. Customer loyalty has been gained as a result of it’s consistent quality products as well as the limited competition offering these services.
Development stage I of Soiled reduced volumes of test chemicals by utilizing a spectrophotometer to provide digital, precise readings in parts per million (ppm) of levels of nutrients. The prototype device is a portable stage and is designed to be compatible with a range of smart devices and their cameras.
Development stage II is intended to replace most of the toxic chemicals used in current soil tests with biosensors that are environmentally friendlier. A software update will be introduced in order to provide more precise readings of nutrient levels in soil tests.
