Welcome to our team page!
We are an interdisciplinary team of undergraduate students from the University of Exeter who hope to make an impact in synthetic biology.  To meet our team, click on the corresponding picture.
Jasmine Bird
BSc Biological Sciences, Year 1
Main role: Lab team
Will always be known for: Killing the toeholds with master mix.
Nickname: Labmeister
Email: jb699@exeter.ac.uk
A member of the lab team, Jasmine played a significant part in the interlab study. She spent most of her time in the Mezzanine lab - toehold testing, Interlab study, characterising chromoproteins and other general lab chores. She also helped design the toehold switches, and wrote up a number of wiki pages, including the interlab study, lab and protocols, safety, and all future pages.
Bradley Brown
BSc Biochemistry, Year 2
Main role: Lab team
Will always be known for: Heat killing and breaking everything all the time.
Nickname: Gremlin
Email: bob203@exeter.ac.uk
Bradley was an invaluable member of the team. From toehold design to data analysis, Bradley was involved in all lab projects. He was in charge of experimental design, which shaped the project greatly but he also prepared many wiki pages including toehold design, experiments and results.
Todd Burlington
MPhys Physics, Year 2
Main role: Modelling and Wiki
Will always be known for: Doing actual work.
Nickname: Everybody’s Darling
The modelling aspect of the project was undertaken by a small team including Todd. He worked on coding the simulation of our toehold system, along with Dan and Amy. He also took great interest in the image of the project, designing and coding the moving ribosome, and creating the poster, banner, and presentation designs.
Rachel Cooley
BSc Biochemistry, Year 2
Main role: Various
Will always be known for: Love of colouring.
Email: rc415@exeter.ac.uk
Rachel was an essential member of the team who helped out with most aspects of the project, this included writing up a number of wiki pages; Attributions, Sponsors, collaborations and Safety, assisting with the wiki, helping out everyone else and everything to do with design.
Yemi Fenuyi
BSc Medical Sciences, Year 2
Main role: Beyond the Bench
Will always be known for: The untimely death of his laptop, RIP
Yemi was heavily involved with research into the medical side of the project which allowed the team to focus on how problems could be specifically addressed in vivo. He was also a member of the outreach team where he attended meetings with the stakeholders of our project and made contact with key members of schools in the local area to organize presentations for the potential scientist of tomorrow.
Daniel Herring
MSci Natural Sciences, Year 2
Main role: Modelling
Will always be known for: Making puns, being the best dancer and breaking Matlab.
Nickname: Deniel
Email: dgh207@exeter.ac.uk
Dan spent the first half of the project solely focused on modelling our system. He worked on the simulation and integrated parameter scanning into our model. In the later half of the project, he continued work on the model, as well as performing a large amount of data analysis and visualisation.
David Markham
BSc Biological Sciences, Year 2
Main role: Wiki
Will always be known for: Loving the Thomas the Tank Engine theme tune too much.
Nickname: Wiki Wizard
The majority wiki is solely down to David’s design and coding. His expertise with HTML and CSS made our wiki something to be proud of. David also contributed to modelling, helping out with the simulation of our cell free system.
Amy Perrelet
MPhys Physics, Year 2
Main role: Beyond the Bench and Modelling
Will always be known for: Complaining and making beautiful faces at everyone.
Nickname: ComplAmy
Amy worked hard on the outreach side of the project, attending meetings with vets, farmers, and other figures affected by bovine TB, as well as creating a clear and elegant infographic on the current testing method of bovine TB. She also found time to be a significant member of the modelling team.
Joseph Slack
BSc Biological Sciences, Year 2
Main role: Beyond the Bench
Will always be known for: Unique singing voice and being a full-time geezer.
Nickname: Wannabe Popstar
Joe was head of the outreach team - he worked tirelessly to make contacts, meet with important figures in the TB eradication field, and create our outreach video. He headed Skype meetings with other teams, and with experts in bovine TB eradication. As well as this huge contribution, he also managed to be a regular member of the lab team, helping with the interlab study and the chromoprotein characterisation.
Georgina Westwood
BSc Medical Sciences, Year 1
Main role: Lab
Will always be known for: Dropping plates and pipette tip boxes and being Queen of Birks halls.
Nickname: Fresh
Email: gw310@exeter.ac.uk
Working as a key member of the lab team, Georgina spent time on the interlab study in the lab as well as chromoprotein characterisation and toehold testing. She also helped design our toehold constructs, as well as working on wiki content pages. In addition she also lead the design and production of our T-shirts and hoodies for Boston.
Emilia Wojcik
BSc Biological Sciences, Year 2
Main role: Lab
Will always be known for: SHUT UP BRADLEY!
Nickname: Emelia
Email: ezw201@exeter.ac.uk
A key figure in the lab, Emilia cast a critical eye over any experiment undertaken, which helped avoid many mistakes. She worked hard on the Interlab Study, both performing the experiments, and writing up data. Emilia continued to contribute as a regular team member, despite starting a placement in the US, by writing up the lab book and Interlab Study wiki pages, as well as proofreading a huge volume of wiki content and helping write presentation scripts and content.
