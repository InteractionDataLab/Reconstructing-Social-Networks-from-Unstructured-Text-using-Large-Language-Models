Matlab Scripts
A few of the many matlab scripts that we made as we went through our project. We have chosen to upload three scripts; the first is the last revision before a significant overhaul, the second is the final script, and finally the third is the script use for parameter scanning.
Before The Change
This is the published script, the .m file, and a gif of our brownian motion simulation. This is an intermediate example of the simulation, before a significant overhaul prompted after a meeting with a computer scientist, Jonathan Fieldsend.
Our intermediate published script.

After The Change
Here we have the published script, the .m file and some output of our final simulation.

Parameter Scanning
