Through the course of our project, we sought assistance from biotechnology companies, receiving overwhelming support from many of them. This support allowed us to complete laboratory work using exceptional equipment and reagents. Many thanks to:
New England Biolabs
Now a recognized world leader in the discovery, development, and commercialisation of recombinant and native enzymes for genomic research.
We received Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, Quick-Load® Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder, NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli, and an NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix. This donation was valuable in a range of protocols we followed and saved time in the laboratory.
BMG LABTECH
A leading global developer and manufacturer of innovative, high-quality, and reliable microplate reader instrumentation.
BMG lent us a high-tech FluoStar Microplate Reader for use in our project. We also received their continuous support. Many thanks to Oliver and Sarah, who offered guidance and fixes for the setbacks we encountered using the microplate reader - mainly due to a lack of experience on our part! We would also like to thank BMG for the article they wrote on their support of our project, available here[link].
SHIELD Scientific
Manufactures nitrile and latex disposable gloves specifically designed for laboratory use.
We were provided with seven boxes of orange nitrile glove of various sizes. These were very useful in the biosafety level II laboratory.
Bioline
As an evolving international company, which develops, manufactures, and markets a wide range of specialized bio-research reagents that simplify, accelerate, and improve life sciences research.
We received a 40% discount on all products.
Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT
The world’s largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development.
We were provided with 20kb of DNA for free. We would like to thank IDT especially for offering us a further 50% discount after we exhausted their supply of free DNA - this goodwill gesture allowed us to complete our project on time and with a limited budget.
Eppendorf
A leading life science company that develops and sells instruments, consumables, and services for liquid-, sample-, and cell handling in laboratories worldwide.
We were provided with a brand new p1000 pipette and LoBind tubes. The tubes allowed our modellers to assume elastic conditions when simulating the interactions at the boundaries of our system.
Affinity
Povide the fastest, smoothest, most precise professional creative software, exclusively for Mac.
They gave us a free copy of Affinity Designer, an excellent vector graphic design program . The software was crucial in the design aspect of our project, allowing us to precisely engineer our image. Thanks especially to Dale.
The following companies provided us with funding to complete our project, giving us limitless opportunities to base our project on any topic we could want. Many thanks to:
The University of Exeter
We received immense support from the university, especially the College of Life and Environmental Sciences and the College of Engineering, Maths and Physical Sciences. We were constantly seeking advice from academics, and using workspace and services provided by the University. We're extremely grateful for this support and have thanked those staff who were particularly helpful on the Attributions page .
The Society for General Microbiology
The largest learned microbiological society in Europe with a worldwide membership based in universities, industry, hospitals, research institutes, and schools.
The University of Exeter’s Annual Fund
The Annual Fund is the University of Exeter’s annual appeal which seeks the philanthropic support of its alumni and friends to invest in the University and its students.
Exeter Microbial Biofuels Group
This group carries out an innovative research programme into plant cell signalling and bioenergy that employs a multidisciplinary combination of high throughput molecular biology, cellular imaging, biochemistry, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology.
The Wellcome Trust
A global charitable foundation dedicated to improving health by supporting bright minds in science, the humanities and social sciences, and public engagement.
The Biochemical Society
The Biochemical Society exists for the advancement of the molecular and cellular biosciences, both as an academic discipline and to promote its impact on areas of science including, agriculture, and medicine. Biochemistry helps to play a key role in tackling global issues such as improving lifelong health, treatment of disease, biotechnology and food security.
BBSRC
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) is one of seven Research Councils that work together as Research Councils UK. They support around 1600 scientists and 2000 research students in universities and institutes across the UK.
