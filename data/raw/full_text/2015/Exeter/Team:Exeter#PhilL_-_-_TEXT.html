Phil Leighton
Penbode Farm Vets
We hosted Phil Leighton at the University to explain to him what our project aims to do. As Phil is involved with XL Farmcare, a company responsible for all bTB testing in the South West, we wanted to know the practicalities we would have to consider for our test to be effective. Phil invited us to a TB test on a farm in Cornwall where we saw the testing of 11 Bullocks and also got the chance to chat with the owner of the farm.
Sample Collection
The target of our test is RNA meaning a blood sample is required from each animal that is being tested. Prior to our meeting with Phil, we believed as a team that the simplest way to collect blood from a cow would be a skin prick. However Phil made it clear to us that this is not possible due to the depth you would have to penetrate with a needle. Current blood testing is done from the base of the underneath of the tail. As cows are in a crush during bTB testing, collecting a sample of blood from the tail is easier and safer than the current Tuberculin test that occurs at the neck of the animal. Phil explained how cows are much more accepting of a vet approaching and working with their tail as oppose to their necks.
Furthermore Phil showed us the current needle and tube that is of standard use for collection of blood from a cow. Initially we believed the components of our test would be in a tube the size of a standard Eppendorf. Logistically Phil said this would not be possible. Collection of blood from the tail into a tube the size of an Eppendorf would not only be extremely difficult it would not contain the blood in a sterile environment - something highly important.
As a team this gave us a number of things to consider when designing how best to contain the cell free aspect of our test. The tube has to contain our test, collect a sample in an efficient and sterile manner and also only allow a small amount of blood to reach the area of the tube our test is contained within.
