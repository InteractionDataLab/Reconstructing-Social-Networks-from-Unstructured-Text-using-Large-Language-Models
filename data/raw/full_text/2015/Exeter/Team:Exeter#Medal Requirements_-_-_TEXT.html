Criteria
Detail
Bronze
#1
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
#2
Complete the Judging form.
Our Judging form can be found here .
#3
Create a Team Wiki .
#4
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
#5
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
#6
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry .
We submitted 4 new BioBrick parts to the iGEM Registry. BBa_K1586003: EsxB toehold riboswitch J23100 (ZeusJ) is the part which responds to this medal criteria.
Silver
#1
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected . This working part must be different to bronze medal criteria #6.
BBa_K1586000: Synthetic toehold riboswitch J23100 (GreenFET1J) was shown to work as expected. It produces GFP in the presence of trigger RNA specific to the switch on our toehold.
#2
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry .
#3
Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues (ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety , security, and intellectual property rights) in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception or other activities.
We have focused on public engagement. We decided to spread TB awareness through speaking to members of the public, surveying their knowledge of the problem, and providing them with a detailed infographic created by the team. In this way we hope to educate the general public on our local problem of bovine TB in cattle.
We also spoke with numerous parties affected by bovine TB, including farmers, vets, companies at the forefront of TB eradication, and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State of Farming, George Eustice. We utilized their expert advice in our project.
Gold
#1
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative human practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities.
We used advice from numerous parties affected by bovine TB, including farmers, vets, companies at the forefront of TB eradication, and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State of Farming, George Eustice. Our prototype bTB test tube design was guided by these figures - especially the vets who would be performing the test.
We also created a video designed to educate the public on the problem of bovine TB using hard-hitting facts and testimonies from high-profile TB experts.
#2
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
#3
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry. This part must not come from your 2015 part range.
In order to allow easier measurement of any constructs we may have made with chromoproteins as an indicator, aeBlue , eforRed , and amajLime by; absorbance spectrum measurement, standard curve construction, and visual limit determination.
#4
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
