Welcome to Exeter iGEM 2015!
Project Description
The primary aim of our project is to design a toehold switch (a type of riboregulator) with the potential to detect any given RNA sequence, and to standardise it into a BioBrick for the future use by other iGEM teams.
Tuberculosis in cattle is a problem local to our region, Devon, causing devastating economic and personal losses to farmers in the dairy and beef industries. Therefore, the immediate application of our project is the detection of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle, in a safe, low-tech and cost-effective manner.
In order to make this a simple test which can be used in the field, we are aiming to express it as a cell-free system. We hope to use a chromoprotein as an indicator, and subsequently characterise it for use in cell-free systems.
