Collaboration:
Throughout iGEM, we have communicated with a great many other teams via twitter and facebook, and a few through Skype.
We have corresponded with the Bielefeld iGEM team via email and Skype as, like our team, Bielefeld are focusing on cell-free systems as part of their project. Their team managed to build their own cell-free kit - they kindly calculated the price of each reaction for us and provided a table of contents. This helped us see how viable it would be for use in the further application of our project. We also had some early discussions regarding chromoproteins. Bielefeld were kind enough to provide us with details on their home-made cell-free kit, which was incredibly useful in terms of costing our TB test and reduced the price signicantly.
The Oxford iGEM team also got in contact to discuss stochastic modelling and simulations with our modelling team. We exchanged information on our project, finding Oxford’s gene expression model particularly impressive.
Another group we contacted was the Manchester-Graz iGEM team , a merge of two groups of students from the UK and Austria. We Skyped their team and discussed chromoproteins and a survey they are undertaking.
We provided an article for the iGEM newsletter Amoy iGEM team are organising. This can be viewed here .
We attended the UK iGEM meetup, hosted and organised by Westminster iGEM .
A highlight of our iGEM collaboration was the group skype we hosted. Seven teams were involved, although ultimately we were plagued with technical issues and ended up in a smaller Skype call. Thanks to the teams we spoke with: Sydney , Manchester-Graz , and Warwick .
We took part in Kent iGEM team’s survey on nanowires, bioreactors, and renewable energy, and we hope that the data we provided will be useful to them.
We also Skyped the NAIT Edmonton team , and talked about Policy and Practices within the New Application track.
