Lab Work
Electrophoresis
by Audrey
Agarose gel 1%, migration 90V
We load on gel 5μL of PCR product.
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707035 (10%), 3. BBa_K1707035 (1%), 4. BBa_K1707036 (10%), 5. BBa_K1707036 (1%),  6. BBa_K1707021 (10%), 7. BBa_K1707021 (1%), 8. BBa_K1707027 (10%), 9. BBa_K1707027 (1%), 10. DNA Ladder , 11. Empty, 12. Empty
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707013 (10%), 3. BBa_K1707013 (1%), 4. BBa_K1707019 (10%), 5. BBa_K1707019 (1%),  6. BBa_K1707020 (10%), 7. BBa_K1707020 (1%), 8. BBa_K1707030 (10%), 9. BBa_K1707030 (1%), 10. DNA Ladder
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K115017, 3. BBa_K115017, 4. BBa_K115017, 5. BBa_K115017
We can conclude that we need to start over all PCR except BBa_K115017 which seems to be OK.
PCR on colony

PCR Products of BBa_K1707037
Verification of K1707037 colony PCR, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #1, 3. #2, 4. #3, 5. #4,  6. #5, 7. #6, 8. #7, 9. #8, 10. #9
We can't conclude anything because we can't see any positive result. So we choose arbitrary 5 clones for different extractions.
Electrophoresis purification
by Audrey
PCR product of BBa_K175017 from the 08/25/2015
In each weel of the agarose gel, we put 45μL of PCR Product + 15 μL Ladder 6x
Agarose gel 1%, Migration 90V
We cut bands with a scalpel and purificate them by the Macherey-Nagel gel purification kit
Plasmid extraction
by Audrey
BBa_K1707022 #1
BBa_K1707023 #2
BBa_K1707037 #5 to #9
BBa_K1707004 #2 (from two different cultures)
With Macherey-Nagel Extraction kit
BBa_K1707004 #5 (digested by SpeI and EcoRI)
BBa_K1707022 #1 (digested by XbaI and PstI)
Agarose gel 1%, migration 90V
We cut corresponding bands with a scalpel.
