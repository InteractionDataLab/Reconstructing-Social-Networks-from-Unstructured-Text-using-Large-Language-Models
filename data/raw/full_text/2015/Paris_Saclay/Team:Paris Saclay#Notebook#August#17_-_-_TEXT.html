Plasmid extraction
by Pauline
BIobricks:
BBa_K1707035 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707036 #1 and #2
With Sylvie Lautru's Protocol:
Take 2 ml of bacteria culture in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube (eppendorf), prepare one sample. Centrifuge the culture for 30s at 11,000 rpm. Discard supernatant and remove as much of the liquid as possible. Repeat this with adding 2 ml of bacteria culture in the same tube.
Add 100 μl of Solution I. Resuspend with pipette.
Add 200 μl of Solution II. Agitate by gently inverting the tube.
Add 150 μl of Solution III. Agitate by inverting the tube.
Let 10 min at 4°C.
Centrifuge for 15 min at 11,000 rpm and retrieve the supernatant in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 100 μl of mix Phenol/Chloroform and agitate by inverting the tube.
Centrifuge 10 min and retrieve the aqueous phase.
Add 2 volumes of 100% ethanol.
Let 10 min at least at 20°C.
Centrifuge 15 min at maximum speed. Retrieve the supernatant.
Add 1 ml of 70% ethanol.
Centrifuge 4 min at maximum speed. Retrieve the supernatant.
Dry
Resuspend in 50 μl of TE/RNAse for a plasmid.
Solution I:
Tris final 25 mM
EDTA final 10 mM
Glucose final 50 mM
Solution II:
SDS final 1%
NaOH final 0.1M
Solution III: CH3COOK 3M (pH 4.8):
28.5 ml H2O
60 ml CH3COOK 5M
11.5 ml pure CH3COOCH
TE/RNAse:
5 μl of RNase (Ci = 10 mg/ml)
1 ml of TE from Macherey-Nagel kit
New culture
