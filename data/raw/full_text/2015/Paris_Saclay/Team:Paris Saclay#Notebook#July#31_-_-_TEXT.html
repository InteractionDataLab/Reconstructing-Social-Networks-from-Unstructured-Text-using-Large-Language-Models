2 µL Plasmid
6 µL H2O
Incubation 2h, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Coralie
Agarose gel, 1% Migration 100V
Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI, from left to right: 1. Empty, 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K1707012#1, 4. BBa_K1707012#2, 5. BBa_K1707012#3, 6. BBa_K1707012#4, 7. BBa_K1707013#1, 8. BBa_K1707013#2, 9. BBa_K1707013#3, 10. BBa_K1707013#2, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI, from left to right: 1. Empty, 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K1707019#1, 4. BBa_K1707019#2, 5. BBa_K1707019#3, 6. BBa_K1707019#4, 7. Empty
We can conclude that all biobricks are OK
Soil experiment
by Coralie and Johan
Soil
Observation of J0 plates: there are a lot of colony in each.
Control (-):
MCK + Tet: 40 pink colonies
MCK + Cm: 10 pink colonies
MCK + Spectino: 1 pink colony
MCK: 100 pink colonies and a lot of white colonies
We can suppose that we have a contamination between our experiment and control. Or maybe we have a MCK problem because we change it during the experiment.
So, we decide to stop the experiment and do some test:
Soil + H2O on new MCK
Soil + LB on new MCK
LB on new MCK
MCK alone
Incubation over night, 37°C
New culture

BBa_I13602
With plasmid: PIJ773
Incubation at 37°C, 250 rpm
