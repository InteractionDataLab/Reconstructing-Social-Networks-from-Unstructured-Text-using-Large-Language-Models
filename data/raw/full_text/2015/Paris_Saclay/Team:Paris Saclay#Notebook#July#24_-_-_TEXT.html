Soil experiment
by Seong Koo
Plates observation and count of CFU:
Strain 1696:
Dilution 1: 424 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 75 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 1 CFU
Strain 1693:
Dilution 1: 524 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 35 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 0 CFU
Strain 1320:
Dilution 1: 111 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 13 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 0 CFU
We take 1g of contaminated soil and treat it like yesterday to spread it on specific plates  Incubation ON, 37°C
