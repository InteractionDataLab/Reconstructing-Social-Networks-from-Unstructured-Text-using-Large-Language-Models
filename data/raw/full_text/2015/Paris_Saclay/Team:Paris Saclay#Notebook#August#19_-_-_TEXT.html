Biobricks:
BBa_K1707023 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707022 #1
BBa_K1707028 #1
Agarose gel 1%, 90V
Wells 1-2: Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI, Wells 4-5: Verification of gel purification; from left to right: 1. BBa_K1707023#1, BBa_K1707023#2, 3. DNA Ladder , 4. BBa_K1707022#1, 5. BBa_K1707028#1,  6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude that BBa_K1707023 #1 and #2 are OK. We can cut BBa_K170708 #1 and BBa_K1707022 #1 bands.
PCR
by Pauline
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707031 #7 to #26
We put 30 µL H2O in eqch tub. We add then the plasmid. And after, the mix.
Mix for each tub:
10 µL Buffer
0,25 µL Forward primer (iPS43)
0,25 µL Reverse primer (iPS44)
1 µL dNTP
0,25 µL GoTAQ
4 µL MgCl2
4,25 µL H2O
