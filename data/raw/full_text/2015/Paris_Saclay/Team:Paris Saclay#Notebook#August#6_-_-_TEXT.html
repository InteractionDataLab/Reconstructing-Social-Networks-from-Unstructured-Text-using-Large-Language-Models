Lab Work
Soil experiment
by Coralie
Water
Observation of plates (05/08/2015) Almost all plates are yellow. We choose to stop the experiment.
We will define a new protocol:
Count of bacteria before contamination
Evaluation of the count of bacteria we should see at Day0
Measurement of the pH before each sampling (We think that maybe the water pH change with adding the LB)
Low Budget Challenge
by Coralie
We can't say a lot of things... But we can see some colony on the agar with the baker's yeast in the agar. We try another time with different agar recipes:
Agar 1:
0,27g Stock Cube
0,600g Agar Agar
0,135g Baker's yeast
0,225g sugar
45mL mineral water
Agar 2:
0,27g Stock Cube
0,600g Agar Agar
0,135g Baker's yeast
45mL mineral water
We make striations with BBa_J23101+BBa_I13504 strain with a curved pin. We do the same on an usual LB plate without antibiotics (Control +)

And PIJ773 digested by NotI
Agarose gel 1%
Migration 90 V
Verification of gel purification, from left to right: 1. BBa_PIJ773 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K1707004, 4. BBa_K1707008, 5. BBa_K1707011, 6. BBa_K1707012, 7. BBa_R0051, 8. BBa_I13600, 9. BBa_I13602, 10. Empty
We made a mistake: BBa_K1707008, BBa_I13602 and Bba_R0051 shouldn't be purified on agarose gel.  We can observe a big smear for PIJ773. We can also observe that BBa_I13602 has three bands. Rest is alright.
