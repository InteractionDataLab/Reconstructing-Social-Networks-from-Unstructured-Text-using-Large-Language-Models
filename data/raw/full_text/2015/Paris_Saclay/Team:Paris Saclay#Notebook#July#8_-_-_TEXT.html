Lab Work
Transformation
by Audrey
BBa_R0051 (2015)
On LB + Ampicillin 100ug/mL
Rehydratation
by Seong Koo, Johan
BBa_R0051 from different years (2013 and 2014)
Digestion
by Pauline, Coralie
First Digestion:
BBa_J23101
BBa_J23106
BBa_J23117
Mix:
10µL of our plasmid with promotor
1µL SpeI
1µL PstI
2µL buffer 10x FastDigest
6µL H2O
Second Digestion:
BBa_K115017
BBa_I13504
Mix:
10µL of our plasmid with gene
1µL XbaI
1µL PstI
2µL buffer 10x FastDigest
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
After this step, we separate the sequence we need from the sequence we don't with electrophoresis
Electrophoresis
by Coralie, Pauline
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5uL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V
BBa_K115017
BBa_I13504
We cut our bands with a scalpel
Cut verification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K115017, 3. BBa_I13504#1, 4. BBa_I13504#2, 5. BBa_I13504#3, 6. Empty
Purification from agarose gel
by Audrey and Pauline
With the Nucleospin Gel Clean Up kit from Macherey-Nagel
BBa_K115017
BBa_I13504
Plasmid extraction
by Coralie
BBa_K1493504
With Nucleospin Kit
Digestion
by Coralie
BBa_K1493504
Mix (2tubes):
33µL H2O
4µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
1µL NotI
We use 2µL of plasmid in each tube
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
Quantification by electrophoresis
by Pauline
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5uL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V
Extracted DNA:
BBa_K115017
BBa_I13504
Digested DNA (by SpeI and PstI):
BBa_J23101
BBa_J23106
Digested DNA (by Not I):
BBa_K1493504
Wells 1-2: Verification/ Wells 4-11: Quantification; from left to right: 1. BBa_K1493504#1, 2. BBa_K1493504#2, 3. DNA Ladder , 4. BBa_J23101#1, 5. BBa_J23101#2, 6. BBa_K115017, 7. BBa_I13504#1, 8. BBa_I13504#2, 9. BBa_I13504#3, 10. BBa_J23106, 11. BBa_J23117, 12. Empty
We can conclude:
BBa_J23101 #1: 10ng/µL
BBa_J23101 #2: 13ng/µL
BBa_I13504 #1 #2 #3: 5ng/µL
BBa_J23106: 15ng/µL
BBa_J23117: 8ng/µL
We can't see anything for BBa_K115017
