Lab Work
Observation of our plates
by Coralie and Johan
Transformations from the 07/10/2015
We can observe that BBa_S03518, BBa_B0030 and BBa_B0015 are OK. But BBa_K1399005 didn't grow. We think that we make a mistake when we rehydrated the plasmid.
Transformations from the 07/09/2015
We can observe that BBa_J23101 + BBa_I13504 and BBa_J23106 + BBa_I13504 are yellow when we expose them to the white light. But BBa_J23117 + BBa_I13504 don't seem to be yellow on the white light.
New culture

New liquid culture of:
Transformations from the 07/09/2015:
BBa_J23101 + BBa_I13504
BBa_J23106 + BBa_I13504
BBa_J23117 + BBa_I13504
BBa_B0015
BBa_B0030
BBa_S03518
2x 5ml LB + 10μl Chloramphenicol + 1 bacterial colony.  We incubate cultures at 37°C, ON.
Ligation
by Pauline
Reaction mix:
BBa_J23101: 1µL
BBa_K115017: 10µL
Buffer (10x): 2µL
Ligase: 1µL
H2O: 6µL
Incubation 3h at 4°C
Transformation

BBa_K139905
BBa_K1399019
BBa_K1399023
Ligation product:
BBa_J23101 + BBa_K115017 = BBa_K1707000
Plasmid extraction
BBa_R0051
Culture form the 07/10/2015 We put back in culture 200µL of this one in 5mL of LB + Ampicilline
