The first <B>Team Paris Saclay</B> was created in 2011 by both students and researchers found of synthetic Biology who had heard about a competition which was becoming more and more important on the other side of the Atlantic, the iGEM competition.</P><P>Our team is composed of students from different scientific fields forming a formidable multidisciplinary group. We are advised by two PhD  and four researchers from the <B>Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell</B> (I2BC). This institute regroups 80 teams of scientists, 15 technological facilities from 8 research units. It hosts us and helps us every year for the realisation of our project and we thank all the members and managers of the institute for their very welcoming care.</P><H2>Students</H2><ARTICLE class="column"><H3>Audrey Moatti</H3><P><B>Immunology</B><B>a.k.a</B>: Fishers<B>If you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have?</B> A system which permits to change the bacteria color depending of its mood: it would be green if the bacteria feels happy, red if it's angry, and black if it feels depressed or wistful.<B>One talent:</B> Best piggy imitation ever.<B>Funniest lab disaster</B>: For my first iGEM lab day, I did drop a full tube of glass beads on the lab floor.
