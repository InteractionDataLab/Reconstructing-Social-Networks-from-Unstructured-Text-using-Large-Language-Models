Lab Work
Digestion
by Pauline
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707035 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707036 #1 and #2
Mix for each plasmid:
2 µL plasmid
0,5 µL XbaI
0,5 µL PstI
1 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
6 µL H2O
Incubation 37°C, 3h
Plasmid extraction
by Pauline
BBa_K1707022 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707023 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707034 #1 and #2
With Sylvie Lautru's Protocol
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, migration 90V
BBa_K1707035 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707036 #1 and #2
Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707035#1, 3. BBa_K1707035#2, 4. BBa_K1707036#1, 5. BBa_K1707036#2, 6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude that BBa_K1707035 #1, BBa_K1707036 #1 and #2 are OK, but not BBa_K1707035 #2
Inoculation
by Pauline
3 strains: 1320; 1693; 1696
in 10mL LB without antibiotic
