Lab Work
Transformation
by Audrey
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707004
BBa_K1707009
As usual
Plasmid extraction
by Johan
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707008 #3, #4, #5 and #6
With the Macherey-Nagel Extraction kit
Ligation
by Pauline
BBa_K1707011: BBa_B0030 + BBa_K1707010 #1
3 µL BBa_B0030
5 µL BBa_K1707010
2 µL Buffer Ligase 10x
1 µL Ligase
BBa_K1707021: BBa_K1707000 + BBa_K1707010
1,5µL BBa_K1707000
5 µL BBa_K1707006
1 µL Buffer Ligase 10x
1 µL Ligase
1,5 µL H2O
Incubation 4h, 4°C
Digestion Verification
by Pauline
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707008 #2, #3, #4, #5, #6
BBa_K1707005 #1 and #2
Mix:
1 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
0,5 µL XbaI
2 µL Plasmid
6,5 µL H2O
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, migration 80V then 110V
Verification by digestion with XbaI, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_J23101, 3. BBa_K1707008#2, 4. BBa_K1707008#3, 5. BBa_K1707008#4, 6. BBa_K1707008#5, 7. BBa_K1707008#6, 8. BBa_K1707001#1, 9. BBa_K1707005#1, 10. BBa_K1707005#2, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can conclude that BBa_K1707008 isn't OK, and BBa_K1707005 #1 and #2 are OK

Ligation
by Coralie
BBa_K1707008: BBa_J23101 + BBa_K1707003
2,5 µL BBa_J23101
11 µL BBa_K1707003
2 µL Buffer Ligase 10x
1 µL Ligase
3,5 µL H2O
Incubation over night, 16°C
Soil experiment
by Coralie
Soil
Observation of J0 plates: there are a lot of colony in each. Contamination is alright. Controls (+) and (-) are Ok too. We take 1g of each pot of soil and we dilute it in 5mL sterile H2O. After shaking and decant, we put 100µL of supernatant on the right plate. Incubation ON 37°C
