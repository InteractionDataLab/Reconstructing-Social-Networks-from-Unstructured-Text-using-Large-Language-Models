Ligation
by Pauline
In each tube:
3 µL Buffer DNA pol T4
1µL DNA pol T4
4µL H2O
BBa_J23101 (10µL) + BBa_S03518 (12µL)
BBa_S03518 (12µL) + BBa_B0015 (10µL)
BBa_B0015 (10µL) + BBa_I13602 (12µL)
Incubation 4h, 4°C
New culture
by Coralie
1696: Bad::Tet
1320:ClpP::Cm
1693:z1:Spect
On LB plates, incubation ON, 37°C
Transformation
by Johan
Transformation with ligation product:
BBa_J23101 + BBa_S03518 = BBa_K1707001
BBa_B0015 + BBa_I13602 = BBa_K1707002
BBa_S03518 + BBa_B0015 = BBa_K1707003
