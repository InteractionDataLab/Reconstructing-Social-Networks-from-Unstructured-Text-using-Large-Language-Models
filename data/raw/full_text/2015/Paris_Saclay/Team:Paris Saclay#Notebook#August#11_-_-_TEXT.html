Digestion
by Coralie
BBa_K1707026 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707032 #1 and #2
Mix for each reaction:
0,5 µL PstI
0,5 µL XbaI
1 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
6 µL H2O
2 µL plasmid
Incubation 37°C, 2h
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, migration 90V
Biobricks:
Quantification:
BBa_K1707011 #3 (plasmid)
BBa_K1707012 #2 (plasmid)
Verification of digestion:
BBa_K1707026 #1
BBa_K1707026 #2
BBa_K1707028 #1
BBa_K1707028 #2
BBa_K1707032 #1
BBa_K1707032 #2
Wells 1-2: Quantification, Wells 4-9: Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI; from left to right: 1. K1707011#3 plasmid, 2. K1707012#2, 3. DNA Ladder , 4. BBa_K1707026#1, 5. BBa_K1707026#2, 6. BBa_K1707028#1, 7. BBa_K1707028#2, 8. BBa_K1707032#1, 9. K1707032#1, 10. Empty
We can conclude:
Quantification:
BBa_K1707011 #3 (plasmid): 13 µg/µL
BBa_K1707012 #2 (plasmid): 20 µg/µL
Verification of digestion:
BBa_K1707026 #1: OK but not totally digested
BBa_K1707026 #2: OK but not totally digested
BBa_K1707028 #1: OK
BBa_K1707028 #2: OK
BBa_K1707032 #1: OK but not totally digested
BBa_K1707032 #2: OK but not totally digested

Transformation
by Pauline
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707016
BBa_K1707031
BBa_K1707033
As usual
Low cost experiment
by Coralie
We make 8 plates:
In each one:
0,27g Stock Cube
0,600g Agar Agar
0,135g Baker's yeast
45mL mineral water
We make 3 LB plates for control
We use the strain created for the Interlab Study (BBa_J23101 + GFP) to make stries on each plate. We put 3 plates in each condition (2 home-made + 1 LB plate)
37°C
In a yogurt maker
On the table
