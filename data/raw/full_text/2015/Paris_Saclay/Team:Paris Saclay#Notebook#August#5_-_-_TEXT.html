Soil experiment
by Coralie
Water
Observation of plates (04/08/2015) We can see a lots of pink colony. Sea water + 1696 (Dil:1): We can see that the MCK is all yellow.
J1: we take 100µL of each water and put it on plates with specific antibiotic:
MacConkey + Spectinomycin
MacConkey + Tetracyclin
MacConkey + Chloramphenicol
And only MacConkey for the Water + LB
Incubation ON, 37°C
Low Budget Challenge
by Coralie
We can't say anything about the agar: is it a bacterial mat or nothing is on the plate? We choose to incubate another time over night plates at 37°C
