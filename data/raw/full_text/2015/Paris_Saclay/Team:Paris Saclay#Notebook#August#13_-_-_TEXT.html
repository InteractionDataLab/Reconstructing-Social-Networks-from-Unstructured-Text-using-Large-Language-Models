Wells 2-5: Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI, Wells 6-10: Verification of gel purification; from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707016#1, 3. BBa_K1707016#2, 4. BBa_K1707031#1, 5. BBa_K1707031#2,  6. BBa_K1707033#1, 7. BBa_K1707033#2, 8. BBa_K1707011#3, 9. BBa_K1707012#2, 10. BBa_R0051 (2nd send)
We can cut all purification bands. For the verification, we can say that BBa_K1707016 #1 and #2 are OK, but not BBa_K1707031 #1 or #2.
We made a stock of BBa_K1707016 #1 and #2 and BBa_K1707033 #1 and #2.
