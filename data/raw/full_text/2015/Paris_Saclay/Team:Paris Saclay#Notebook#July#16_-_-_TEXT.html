BBa_S03518
BBa_B0015
BBa_I13602
In each tube:
Plasmid: 10µL
Enzyme: 1µL of each enzyme
Buffer FastDigest (10x): 2µL
H2O: 6µL
Enzymes choice:

BBa_S03518 #2: SpeI + EcoRI
BBa_B0015 #1: PstI + SpeI
BBa_B0015 #2: XbaI + EcoRI
BBa_I13602 (x2): XbaI + Pst I
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
PCR
by Coralie
BBa_R0051
We use the rehydrated plasmid from the iGEM plate 2014
Reaction mix for 3 tubes:
GC Buffer (5x): 30µL
dNTP (10mM): 3µL
Forward Primer (1/10): 7,5µL
Reverse Primer (1/10): 7,5µL
Template DNA R0051 (2014): 5µL
DNA Pol Phusion: 1,5µL
H2O: 97,5µL
We use 50µL of that mix in each tube
Cycle: Initiation: 98°C - 30seconds Cycle (34 repeats): 98°C - 10seconds / 65°C - 30seconds / 72°C - 20seconds Term.: 72°C - 5min Keep it at 4°C
New culture
by Seong Koo
Observation of our plates: a lot of colony in each one.  New liquid culture of:
BBa_K1399005
BBa_K1399019
BBa_K1399023
Ligation product: BBa_J23101 + BBa_K115017
2x 5ml LB + 10μl Chloramphenicol + 1 bacterial colony.  We incubate cultures at 37°C, ON.

DNA Extraction and purification
by Coralie
BBa_S03518 #1 and #2
BBa_B0015 #1 and #2
BBa_I13602 (x2)
BBa_R0051 (from PCR)
We use the PCR Clean Up / Gel Extraction Kit from Macherey-Nagel We elute DNA in 30 µL.
Quantification on Agarose Gel
by Johan
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5µL of BET We load 2µL of previous purified DNA with 2 µL of DNA Loading (6x) and 8 µL of H2O Migration 0,06A 80V
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_S03518#1, 3. BBa_S03518#2, 4. BBa_B0015#1, 5. BBa_B0015#2, 6. BBa_I13602#1, 7. BBa_I13602#2, 8. BBa_R0051#1, 9. BBa_BBa_R0051#2, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can observe that the PCR of R0051 was effective. We can quantify purified DNA:
BBa_S03518 #1: 15 ng/µL
BBa_S03518 #2: 15ng/µL
BBa_B0015 #1: 10 ng/µL
BBa_B0015 #2: 10 ng/µL
BBa_I13602 (x2): 5ng/µL
BBa_R0051: 10 ng/µL
