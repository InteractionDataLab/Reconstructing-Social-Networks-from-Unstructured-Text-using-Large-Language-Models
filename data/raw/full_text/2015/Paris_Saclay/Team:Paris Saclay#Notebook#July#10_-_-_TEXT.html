Lab Work
PCR
by Coralie
PCR Mix (for 3 tubes)
GC Buffer: 30µL
dNTP 10mM: 3µL
Forward Primer (dilution: 1/10e):  7,5µL
Reverse Primer (dilution: 1/10): 7,5µL
Template DNA K115017 (dilution 1/10e): 6µL
DNA polymerase Phusion: 1,5µL
H2O: 94,5µL
In each tube: 50µL from the mix
Cycle: Initiation: 98°C - 30seconds Cycle (30 repeats): 98°C - 10seconds / 53°C - 30seconds / 72°C - 10seconds Term.: 72°C - 5min Keep it at 4°C
Verification of PCR products by electrophoresis
by Coralie
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5µL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. Empty, 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K115017, 4. BBa_K115017, 5. BBa_K115017, 6. Empty
We confirm that the PCR was effective. We can continue the protocol.
Digestion
by Coralie
We digest 2 tubes of the PCR product Mix for each tube:
XbaI: 1µL
PstI: 1µL
FastDigest Buffer: 2µL
H2O: µL
PCR product: 10µL
Incubation at 37°C for 1 hour
Purification of the digested PCR product
by Coralie
We use the Nucleospin kit from Magerey Nagel Keep the product at -20°C
Quantification of the PCR product
by Coralie
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5µL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K115017, 3. BBa_K115017, 4. Empty, 5. Empty, 6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty
Concentration of the digested and purified PCR product: 50ng/µL
Transformation
by Johan, Seong Koo
BBa_S03518
BBa_B0030

BBa_K1399005
New culture
by Johan
New liquid culture of:
BBa_R0051 (2015)
5ml LB + 10μl Ampicilline + 1 bacterial colony.  We incubate cultures at Room temperature for 4days.
