Lab Work
Purification
by Pauline
BBa_I13602 #1
BBa_I13602 #2
BBa_K1707020
BBa_K1707030
With Macherey-Nagel Purification kit
Quantification
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, Migration 90V
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707020, 3. BBa_K1707030, 4. BBa_I13602#1, 5. BBa_I13602#2,  6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude:
BBa_I13602 #1: 40 µg/µL
BBa_I13602 #2: 40 µg/µL
BBa_K1707020: 10 µg/µL
BBa_K1707030: 13 µg/µL
Digestion
by Coralie
BBa_K1707011 #3 and BBa_K1707012 #2
Mix for each reaction:
1 µL PstI
1 µL XbaI
2 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
6 µL H2O
10 µL plasmid
Incubation 37°C, 2h
Purification on gel
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, 90V
BBa_K1707011 #3
BBa_K1707012 #2
Verification of gel purification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707011#3, 3. BBa_K1707012#2, 4. Empty, 5. Empty,  6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude that biobricks are OK
