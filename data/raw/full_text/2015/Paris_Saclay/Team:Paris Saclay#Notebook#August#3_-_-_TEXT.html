Soil experiment
by Coralie
Soil
Observation of plates (31/07/2015):
Soil + H2O on new MCK:  lots of colonies are visible
Soil + LB on new MCK: lots of colonies are visible
LB on new MCK: nothing
MCK alone: nothing
We can suppose two different hypothesis:
The soil is contaminated
the MCK isn't OK for our experiment: now we add lactose in the preparation. We will try with sorbitol instead of lactose.
We try soil + H2O and soil +LB on:
MCK + Sorbitol: Without antibiotics, with Spectinomycine, Tetramycine or Chloramphenicol
MCK + Lactose: Without antibiotics, with Spectinomycine, Tetramycine or Chloramphenicol
Incubation ON, 37°C
Low Budget experiment
by Coralie
We wanted to participate to the Low Budget Challenge organized by Colombia. First step is to try to make an agar plate.
So we try two recipes:
#1:
0,27g stock cube
0,675g agar agar
0,135g baker's yeast
#2
0,36g stock cube
0,675g agar agar
We boiled mix in glass cup of yoghurt (have been disinfected before use with alcohol) with micro-wave. We put 100µL of a GFP culture (BBa_J23101+BBa_I13504), spread by a wrench (have been disinfected before use with alcohol).
Incubation ON, 37°C
