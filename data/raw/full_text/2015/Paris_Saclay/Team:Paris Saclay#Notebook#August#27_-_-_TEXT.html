Verification of PCR products:
BBa_K1707013
BBa_K1707019
BBa_K1707020
BBa_K1707030
BBa_K1707035
BBa_K1707036
BBa_K1707021
BBa_K1707027
Controls (-)
Agarose gel 1%, Migration 115V
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707036, 3. BBa_K1707021+DMSO, 4. BBa_K1707021, 5. BBa_K1707027+DMSO,  6. BBa_K1707027, 7. Reverse oligo control BBa_K1707013+DMSO, 8. Reverse oligo control BBa_K1707013, 9. Forward oligo control BBa_K1707013+DMSO, 10. Forward oligo control BBa_K1707013
Verification of PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707013+DMSO, 3. BBa_K1707013, 4. BBa_K1707019+DMSO, 5. BBa_K1707019,  6. BBa_K1707020+DMSO, 7. BBa_K1707020, 8. BBa_K1707030+DMSO, 9. BBa_K1707030, 10. BBa_K1707035+DMSO, 11. BBa_K1707035, 12. BBa_K1707036+DMSO
We can conclude that:
BBa_K1707035 and BBa_K1707036 aren't OK, we will have to start again
All of the next one (+DMSO) are OK:
BBa_K1707013
BBa_K1707019
BBa_K1707020
BBa_K1707030
BBa_K1707021
BBa_K1707027
