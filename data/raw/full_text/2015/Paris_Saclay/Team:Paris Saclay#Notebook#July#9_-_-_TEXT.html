Plasmid Rehydratation
by Johan and Audrey
BBa_S03518
BBa_B0030
BBa_B0015
BBa_K1399005
Digestion
by Pauline and Audrey
Plasmid with promotor: BBa_J23101
10µL of our plasmid with promotor
1µL SpeI
1µL PstI
2µL buffer 10x FD
Plasmid with gene: BBa_COO40 and BBa_K115017
10µL of our plasmid with gene
1µL XbaI
1µL PstI
2µL buffer 10x FD
After this step, we separate the sequence we need from the sequence we don't with electrophoresis
Electrophoresis
by Pauline and Audrey
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5µL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_C0040, 3. BBa_K115017, 4. BBa_J23101, 5. Empty, 6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
Quantification
by Pauline and Audrey
Preparation of Agarose Gel 1%, 0,5g in 50mL of 1X TAE, 0,5µL of BET Migration 0,06A 80V  We quantify with the electrophoresis gel:
BBa_C0040: 10ng/µL
BBa_J23101: 20ng/µL
BBa_K115017: we don't see enough of fluorescent to quantify the biobrick. We decide to amplify this one by PCR.
