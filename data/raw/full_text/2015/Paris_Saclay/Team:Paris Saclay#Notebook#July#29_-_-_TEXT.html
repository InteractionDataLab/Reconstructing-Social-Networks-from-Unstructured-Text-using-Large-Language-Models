We can conclude that K1707005 isn't digested
We can conclude the quantification:
BBa_K1707003 #5: 10ng/µL
BBa_K1707008 #1: not OK
BBa_K1707010 #1: 10 ng/µL
BBa_R0051: 8ng/µL

Soil experiment
by Johan and Coralie
Soil
Observation of J0 plates: there are a lot of colony in each. Contamination is alright. Controls (+) and (-) are Ok too. We take 1g of each pot of soil and we dilute it in 5mL sterile H2O. After shaking and decant, we put 100µL of supernatant on the right plate. Incubation ON 37°C
Water
We can't see anything on water plates. We try another type, like yesterday but without dilution and dilution 10-1. We 100µL of different dilution on each type of plate:
LB without antibiotic
LB + Spectinomycin
LB + tetracyclin
LB + Chloramphenicol
MacConkey without antibiotic
MacConkey + Spectinomycin
MacConkey + Tetracyclin
MacConkey + Chloramphenicol
Incubation ON 37°C
