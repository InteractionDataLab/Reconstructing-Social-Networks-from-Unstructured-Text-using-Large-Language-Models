Quantification
by Pauline
BBa_R0051 (2nd send)
BBa_K1707011 #3
BBa_K1707012 #2
BBa_K1707033 #1 and #2
Mix:
2 µL plasmid
2 µL DNA Loading 6X
6 µL H2O
Agarose gel 1%, Migration 90V
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707011#3 (08/12), 3. BBa_K1707011#3 (08/12), 4. BBa_K1707012#2 (08/12), 5. BBa_K1707012#2 (08/13),  6. BBa_K1707033#1, 7. BBa_K1707033#2, 8. BBa_R0051 (2nd send), 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude:
BBa_R0051 (2nd send): 13 µg/µL
BBa_K1707011 #3: 40 µg/µL
BBa_K1707012 #2: 35 µg/µL
BBa_K1707033 #1 and #2: 20 µg/µL
New culture
by Pauline
BBa_K1707035
BBa_K1707036
We put 2 new clones in 5mL LB + 5µL Chloramphenicol
Plasmid extraction
by Pauline
BBa_K1707031 #3, #4, #5 and #6
With Macherey-Nagel Extraction kit
Digestion
by Pauline
BBa_K1707031 #3, #4, #5 and #6
Mix for each:
BBa_K1707011 and BBa_K1707012
0,5 µL XbaI
0,5 µL PstI
1 µL FastDigest Buffer 10x
6 µL H2O
2 µL plasmid
Incubation 37°C, 1H30
Ligation
by Pauline
BBa_K1707023: BBa_K1707012 and BBa_J23101
5,9 µL BBa_K1707012
5 µL BBa_J23101
2 µL Ligase
1,5 µL Buffer
0,6 µL H2O
BBa_K1707022: BBa_K1707011 and BBa_R0051
5,4 µL BBa_K1707011
7,6 µL BBa_R0051
2 µL Ligase
2 µL Buffer
3 µL H2O
BBa_K1707034: BBa_K1707033 and BBa_J23101
11 µL BBa_K1707033
5 µL BBa_J23101
2 µL Ligase
2 µL Buffer
Incubation 3h, 4°C
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel, 1%, Migration 90V
Verification of gel purification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707030#3, 3. BBa_K1707031#4, 4. BBa_K1707031#5, 5. BBa_K1707031#6,  6. Empty, 7. Empty, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
Biobricks:
Verification:
BBa_K1707031 #3, #4, #5 and #6
We can conclude that all clones aren't OK because the band viewed corresponding to the BBa_R0040 plasmid
