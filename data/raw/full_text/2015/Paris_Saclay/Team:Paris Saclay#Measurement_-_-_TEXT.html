Interlab study
Introduction
Simultaneously of our projet, we participated at the Interlab Study 2015 . The purpose of this study is to collect fluorescent data from three different constructions with the collaboration of different iGEM teams from all around the world. We worked with E. coli DH5α as chassis, and the 3 constructions
BBa_J23101 + BBa_I13504
BBa_J23106 + BBa_I13504
BBa_J23117 + BBa_I13504
were cloned in the reference plasmid: PSB1C3 at 7th July . Controls used are the same constructions, without the BBa_I13504.
Preparation of the constructions
All constructs used were transformed into DH5α strain at 16th July . First of all, we rehydrated the different BioBricks and transformed them into cells. After this step we used the standard assembly protocol to insert BBa_I13504 as suffix. The different DNA fragments containing promoters were cut with SpeI and PstI enzymes, and
BBa_I13504 with SpeI and XbaI. We ligated them using T4 DNA Ligase. The third last wells correspond to our 3 constructs. We observe 2 bands at 2000bp and 900bp corresponding to the expected size for the digested fragments. The identity of our 3 constructs was confirmed by electrophoresis .
Preview
After taking our different colonies from the LB plate, we put them on UV lamp. The construction with BBa_J23101 had the strongest fluorescence, but the construction with BBa_J23117 showed the same fluorescence as the control.
Our bacteria were put in 5mL LB in 25mL glass tube. Kept at 37°C over night with 150rpm (position with angle in Unitron INFORS HT Incubation Shakers. In the morning we dilute our samples to obtain a 0,1 DO (it takes one hour to pass all the controls in the cytometer). For the first test, it appeared that bacteria cultures were overgrown, and we observed two times the DO max so we obtained a duplicate of our sample.
Protocols
Measuring
In first place we used a flux cytometer PARTEC Cyflow CUBE 6 All the controls correspond to the exact constructions without BBa_I13504. The dark color curves correspond to the controls, the light ones to the constructions tested. The blue one corresponds with the other blue and the green with the other.
23rd July : The different samples were analyzed at DO max.
30th July : We tested another biological replicate, with DO:0.6 and DOmax. The black picks are LB tests.
We observe that promoter BBa_J23101 allows a 10 fold induction of fluorescence compared to BBa_J23106. Moreover J23117 has a curve response comparable to the control.

Test to obtain the best excitation/emission
We observed with flow cytometry results that the maximum of fluorescence is obtained with BBa_J23101+GFP in stationary phase, we used these conditions to setup the experiment.
Excitation 465nm to obtain the best emission wavelength
We fixed the emission wavelength at 520nm and process to obtain the best excitation wavelength

OD600#0,5 (between 0,4 and 0,55) 300 µl of each sample were taken out and put on a 96-well plate (flat transparent bottom, black wall) to measure fluorescence.

We observe a peak of fluorescence with BBa_J23101+BBa_I13504, and a lesser one with BBa_J23106+BBa_I13504. But with the last one BBa_J23117+BBa_I13504 we observe a result similar to the negative control.
Results
We see that the construct BBa_J23101 is the strongest of our 3 promoters. BBa_J23106 showed the lowest fold induction response, and the BBa_J23117 showed the same response as the different controls. And this result was obtained with the two different methods (flux cytometer and microplate reader). When the electrophoresis was done, we saw that the construct J23117+I13504 was inserted in pSB1C3, but it appeared that the activity of this promoter was really low or null.

New culture of BBa_J23101/BBa_J23106/BBa_J23117 + BBa_I13504
Tecan utilisation:
We use only LB without chloramphenicol and we suspect a contamination of our samples. We depose in each well 300µL. We analyse the OD and fluorescence's variation (the excitation and emission wave lenght were choen after a scan in the process to obtain the best results). For each sample, we depose twelve times (12x8 plate).

We let it run for 20 cycles of 1 hour.
29th July
Tecan utilisation:
This time, we use LB and chloramphenicol because the plate has just a protection and we suspect a contamination of our samples. We depose in each well 300µL. We analyse the OD and fluorescence's variations (the excitation and emission wave lenght were chosen after a scan in the process to obtain the best results).
For each sample we use 3 different colonies, we depose 2 times each colonies (12x8 plate).
