Team
We are the 2015 version of the Paris-Saclay team and we will proudly represent the Paris Saclay University at Boston for the fourth consecutive year. The first Team Paris Saclay was created in 2011 by both students and researchers found of synthetic Biology who had heard about a competition which was becoming more and more important on the other side of the Atlantic, the iGEM competition.
Our team is composed of students from different scientific fields forming a formidable multidisciplinary group. We are advised by two PhD  and four researchers from the Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell (I2BC). This institute regroups 80 teams of scientists, 15 technological facilities from 8 research units. It hosts us and helps us every year for the realisation of our project and we thank all the members and managers of the institute for their very welcoming care.
Students
Audrey Moatti
Immunologya.k.a: FishersIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? A system which permits to change the bacteria color depending of its mood: it would be green if the bacteria feels happy, red if it's angry, and black if it feels depressed or wistful.One talent: Best piggy imitation ever.Funniest lab disaster: For my first iGEM lab day, I did drop a full tube of glass beads on the lab floor. The easiest way to generate head injury... (there is still one or two beads hidden somewhere)
Cheikh Fall Ndiaye
Physics & Engineering of Energya.k.a: BoltIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? Sequencing.Bragging rights: Loading.Funniest lab disaster: Error 404 : disaster information not found (or classified).
Coralie Demon-Chaine
Cancerologya.k.a: KoIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? a system to produce caffein in my stomach inducible by closing the eyelids.One talent: The big ridiculous smile to my colleagues which means "could you make an agarose gel for me please?"Funniest lab disaster: Everything that implicates a computer or other technology...
Ibtissam K.S
Microbiologya.k.a: Sleepy StoneIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? a system which activates a hidden source of energy with a continous supply of chocolate to cope with crisis moments.One talent: I can blew out people's  eardrums,  thanks to my legendary scream.
Johan Bourdarias
Biochemistrya.k.a: boubou91If you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? a system.One talent: I can write my firstname in all languages.Funniest lab disaster: All the team conclued that my music was the worst lab disaster
Pauline Aubert
Chemistrya.k.a: PoIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? I would produced a coloured molecule.One talent: I am particularly good at making start Audrey.Funniest lab disaster: I am certainly the one who did the most gaff in the lab.
Seong Koo Kang
Biochemistrya.k.a: SKIf you were a BioBrick, which behaviours would you have? A system that doesn't need food to works.Funniest lab disaster: Absolute need to sit on a stool to look for something in the fridge
Advisors
Alice Devigne
Lab:Institut de Biologie Intégrative de la Cellule
Thesis subject: My PhD focuses on caracterisation of a protein implicated in radioresistance in Deinococcus radiodurans bacteria
Claire Baudier
Lab: Institut MICALIS (Microbiologie de l’Alimentation au service de la Santé)
Thesis subject:My PhD focuses on the mechanisms responsible for resource allocation in bacteria using a model-driven approach. I work on the Bacillus subtilis bacterium, for which there is a growing interest in the field of biotechnologies.
Fabio Maschi
Computer EngineeringOne talent: 72 hours without sleep working on this wiki
Responsabilities: Student advisor.
Maher Ben Khaled
Fundamental microbiologya.k.a: The spammerOne talent: I can speak with bacteria, I get along very well with E. coli K12
Funniest lab disaster: I lost count
Responsabilities: Human practices, internal and external communication, student advisor.
Instructors

Sylvie Lautru
Lab: Institut de Biologie Intégrative de la Cellule
In our team, we are working on discovering new bioactive metabolites produced by soil bacteria, Streptomyces, on understanding the biosynthetic pathways of these metabolites and on designing new pathways to synthesize new metabolites.
