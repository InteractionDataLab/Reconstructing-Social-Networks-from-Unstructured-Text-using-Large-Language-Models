Soil contamination experiment
by Johan and Coralie We use a soil extract which was prepared by suspending 1g of soil in 5mL of steril water. We made 5 dilutions of the supernatant: 10^-2, 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5 and 10^-6. We streaked 100µL of each dilution in different plates:
LB medium:
Without any antibiotic
100ng/µL Spectinomycin
20 ng/µL Chloramphenicol
10ng/µL Tetracycline
Mac Conkey medium:
Without any antibiotic
100ng/µL Spectinomycin
20 ng/µL Chloramphenicol
10ng/µL Tetracycline
Incubation ON, 37°C
