Lab Work
Plasmid extraction
by Pauline
BBa_K1707008 #1 to #6
BBa_I13600 #1 and #2
With the Macherey-Nagel Extraction kit
Digestion Verification
by Pauline and Coralie
BBa_K1707008 #1 to #6
Mix:
2 µL Plasmid
0,5 µL  XbaI
0,5 µL PstI
1 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
6 µL H2O
Incubation 2h, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1% Migration 90V
Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI of BBa_K1707008, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #1, 3. #2, 4. #3, 5. #4, 6. #5, 7. #6, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can conclude that all BBa_K1707008 clones are OK
We make a glycerol stock of #1 and #2
Electrophoresis Verification
by Pauline and Coralie
Agarose gel, 1%
Migration 100V
Verification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707021#1, 3. BBa_K1707021#2, 4. BBa_K1707021#3, 5. BBa_K1707021#4, 6. BBa_K1707021#5, 7. BBa_K1707021#6, 8. BBa_K1707011#4, 9. BBa_K1707011#5, 10. BBa_K1707011#6
Verification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707004#1, 3. BBa_K1707004#2, 4. BBa_K1707004#3, 5. BBa_K1707004#4, 6. BBa_K1707004#5, 7. BBa_K1707004#6, 8. BBa_K1707011#1, 9. BBa_K1707011#2, 10. BBa_K1707011#3, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can conclude that:
BBa_K1707021: #2, #3, #4 and #6 are OK
BBa_K1707011: #1 to #6 are OK
BBa_K1707004: #1 to #6 are OK
We make glycerol stock of them.

Soil experiment
by Coralie
Water
Sea Water separate in 5mL in 50mL Falcon Fresh water separate in 5mL in 50mL Falcon Contamination with 1mL Water + LB Water + concentrate cells solution Water + concentrate cells solution 10 fold dilution Water + concentrate cells solution 100 fold dilution
J0: we take 100µL of each water and put it on plates with specific antibiotic:
MacConkey + Spectinomycin
MacConkey + Tetracyclin
MacConkey + Chloramphenicol
And only MacConkey for the Water + LB
Incubation ON, 37°C
Soil
Observation of plates (03/08/2015):
Less contamination on plates with MCK+Sorbitol thant MCK+Lactose.
We choose to only use MCK+Sorbitol now
Low Budget Challenge
by Coralie
Observation of plates (03/08/2015): We can saw a little bit of colony. We can suppose that the initial culture wasn't enough in growing phase.
We try another time, with the same protocol than the 03/08/2015 but a fresh culture of bacteria.
