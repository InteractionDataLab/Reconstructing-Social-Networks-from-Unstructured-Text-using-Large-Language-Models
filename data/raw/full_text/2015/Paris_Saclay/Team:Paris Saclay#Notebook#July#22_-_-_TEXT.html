Lab Work
Electrophoresis
by Johan and Pauline
PCR Products:
BBa_J23101
BBa_K1707000
Purification quantification:
BBa_K1707002
BBa_J23101
BBa_R0051
BBa_K098997
BBa_K1707001
Undigested plasmids:
BBa_K1707001 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707002 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707003 #2
BBa_J23101
BBa_B0015
We can't see PCR products. We can suppose that they run out the gel.
Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707001#1, 3. BBa_K1707001#2, 4. BBa_K1707002#1, 5. BBa_K1707002#2, 6. BBa_K1707003#2, 7. BBa_J23101, 8. BBa_B0015, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty

We can conclude that K1707003 #2 isn't OK
Plasmid extraction
by Pauline and Seong Koo
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707003 #4 to #9
BBa_C0051
BBa_E0240
BBa_J06702
Soil experiment
by Audrey and Johan
Plates observation and count of CFU:
Strain 1696:
Dilution 1: more than 1000
Dilution 0.1: more than 1000
Dilution 0.01: 441 CFU
Strain 1693:
Dilution 1: more than 1000
Dilution 0.1: more than 1000
Dilution 0.01: 414 CFU
Strain 1320:
Dilution 1: more than 1000
Dilution 0.1: 1744 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 272 CFU
We take 1g of contaminated soil and treat it like yesterday to spread it on specific plates  Incubation ON, 37°C
Electrophoresis of PCR products
Verification PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. Indicator (BBa_J23101), 3. BBa_K1707000#1, 4. BBa_K1707000#2
