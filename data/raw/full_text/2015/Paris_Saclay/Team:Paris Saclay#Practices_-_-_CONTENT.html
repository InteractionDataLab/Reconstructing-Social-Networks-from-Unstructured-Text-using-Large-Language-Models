When browsing previous years iGEM projects to understand what participating to the iGEM competition meant, a redundant observation highlighted  the fact that biosafety was often a forgotten aspect in iGEM projects. Even when biosafety was taken into account, it seemed that it was integrated late in the conception of the project, after the choice of the chassis and the design of the system. In fact, we only found one project entirely focusing on biosafety (Paris Bettencourt 2012). This is when we decided to work on helping iGEM teams to better consider this aspect of their project. To determine whether biosafety was still undervalued by iGEM teams in 2015, we prepared a survey asking teams whether they had considered the possible effects of the release of their organism in the environment. Because we wanted to be useful to the community, we also asked which organism they chose as chassis. The results of this survey (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay/Description#survey">Survey results</A>) showed us that (i)biosafety was still not a major concern for many iGEmers who answered our survey and that (ii) <I>Escherichia coli</I> was still the chassis of choice in iGEM projects. This incited us to consider several directions for our project. First we chose to focus on designing biosafety systems for <I>E. coli</I> chassis . Second, as some iGEMers seemed to consider that releasing <I>E. coli</I> in the environment was not a problem, as bacteria will die, we decided to investigate whether this was indeed the case (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay/Description#contamination">contamination experiments</A>). Third, we thought that we should take into account physical containment as well as biological containment, as this would certainly be useful for devices aimed at being used in the environment (such as biosensors or bioremediation devices) (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay/Description#physical">physical containment</A>). For the biological containment aspect of our project, we decided to concentrate on preventing the dissemination of GE <I>E. coli</I> in the environment, as the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt">Paris Bettencourt</A> team 2012 already worked on preventing horizontal gene transfer with their Bware project. We chose to control the life or death of our bacteria using temperature, allowing them to survive in a defined range of temperatures (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay/Description#thermal">thermal control</A>). Finally, we wanted the future iGEM teams to consider biosafety as an integral part of their projects, and not something to think about when writing the wiki or the safety form. We therefore wrote a Biosafety <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/0/05/Paris_Saclay-biosafety_guide_rouge_final.jpg">guide</A>, which aims at helping iGEM teams to take into account potential biosafety issues <B>at the beginning of the design of their system(s)</B>, rather than after the conception, and possibiliy the execution of their project.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Education_and_Public_Engagement">Education and Public Engagement</SPAN></H3><P>We particularly focused on public engagement by building through the year an exhibition taking place during a science and art festival called <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ladiagonale-paris-saclay.fr/curiositas/portfolio-items/ceci-nest-pas-un-citron/">CURIOSITas</A>. This festival is taking place at the same time as the giant Jamboree, but members of our team will be present at the festival. Our exhibition comprises a sculpture (realized with the help of a sculptor, Pascal Masi), which is an original way to communicate with public about synthetic biology since it represents an âengineeredâ lemon tree which has two faces (ânaturalâ vs âengineeredâ). It aims at making people think about what they will eat in 50 years and how could synthetic biology change their way of thinking about the living. Another interesting approach was the building of 3D Biobricks Legos which are used to make people basically and playfully understand how living organisms can be engineered. The exhibition also contained classical posters aimed at popularizing synthetic biology and presenting the iGEM competition. A video presenting interviews of citizens about synthetic biology was also shown to get an idea about the knowledge and opinion of people on engineered living organisms. This small exhibition will be moving around different cities through the Parisian region during the Autumn. Furthermore, we plan to re-use it for the Science Festival, a national event taking place on October, 11th.

We decided to continue the story by creating a sculpture made by the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team in collaboration with the sculptor <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://pascal-masi.com/">Pascal Masi</A>. The project of the <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay">iGEM Paris-Saclay team 2014</A> aims to create reflexion around the following questions:
</P><UL><LI> What will you eat in 50 years?</LI><LI> How could synthetic biology change your way of thinking about the living?</LI></UL><P>Moreover the iGEM exhibition presents synthetic biology and invites public to explore the new frontiers of living. We have planned an interactive installation made by seven posters designed by the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team: describing history, principal and functional applications of synthetic biology.
</P><P>Also in collaboration with <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://fablabdigiscope.wordpress.com/">Fablab Digiscop</A>, we printed a set of 3D Biobricks Legos composed of a promotor, a coding sequence and a terminator.
</P><P>To complete our eye-catching exhibition, a video will be available. These short movies present key moments extracted from several interviews made by our team in Paris. The video first shows peopleâs reflexion about what synthetic biology could be used for and then what ethical issues they think it raises. This is a good way to simplify and integrate concepts of biology engineering and make it accessible to the targeted public of this festival: families, children, youths, students, scientists and artists and all those who want to discover this original project that push the boundaries of art and science.

A theatre expert gave us a constructive feedbacks and valuable advices about our presentation. Besides popularization activities, we participated to a discussion about the project of the iGEM Pasteur team and answered a survey helping them to consider impact of the throw of plastic waste in the oceans.

After explaining fundamentals and challenges of synthetic biology, members of the 2015 iGEM Paris-Saclay team held a discussion with the group of High school students and helped them to think about a future iGEM project. Some ideas such as designing a fluorescent human body appears to be very popular among the group of young students!  In order to transpose theory into practice, we offered the young scientists a private visit into the lab (<A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr">Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell</A>).
