Digestion for check
by Audrey
BBa_K115017 (control +)
BBa_J23101 + GFP (control -)
BBa_K1707000 #2, #3 and #4
BBa_K1707013 #1
BBa_K1707030 #1

Electrophoresis to check PCR products
by Audrey
Agarose gel 1%, Migration 90V
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707031 #7 to #26
Verification of BBa_K1707031 PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #7, 3. #8, 4. #9, 5. #10, 6. #11, 7. #12, 8, #13, 9. #14, 10. #15, 11. #16, 12. #17
Verification of BBa_K1707031 PCR products, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #18, 3. #19, 4. #20, 5. #21, 6. #22, 7. #23, 8, #24, 9. #25, 10. #26
We can conclude that all clones aren't OK
