As usual
Plasmid extraction
by Pauline
BBa_R0040 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707020 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707027 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707028 #1 and #2
Plasmid test #1 and #2
With Macherey-Nagel Extraction kit
Digestion verification
by Pauline
BBa_K1707020 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707027 #1 and #2
BBa_K1707028#1 and #2
Plasmid test #1 and #2
Mix:
2 µL plasmid
0,5 µL XbaI
0,5 µL PstI
1µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
6 µL H2O
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
SpeI Test
by Pauline
Mix:
2 µL BBa_K1707028 #1
0,5 µL SpeI
1µL Buffer N
6,5 µL H2O
Incubation 2h30, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Pauline
Agarose gel 1%, 100V
Well 1: Test of SpeI, Wells 3-10: Verification by digestion with XbaI and PstI; from left to right: 1. Test SpeI, 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K1707030#1, 4. BBa_K1707030#2, 5. BBa_K1707020#1, 6. BBa_K1707020#2, 7. BBa_K1707027#1, 8. BBa_K1707027#2, 9. K1707028#1, 10. K1707028#2
We can conlude that:
SpeI is OK
BBa_K1707020 #1 isn't OK
BBa_K1707020 #2 is OK
BBa_K1707027 #1 and #2 are OK
BBa_K1707028 #1 and #2: we have to check them another time
Plasmid test #1 and #2 are OK but not totally digested
New culture
by Pauline
BBa_R0051 #1
with 5mL LB and 5 µL Ampicillin
Digestion Verification
by Pauline
Mix:
2 µL Plasmid
0,5 µL XbaI
0,5 µL PstI
6 µL H2O
1 µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
Low budget challenge
by Coralie
We can see a lot of small colony. We put it ON 37°C.
