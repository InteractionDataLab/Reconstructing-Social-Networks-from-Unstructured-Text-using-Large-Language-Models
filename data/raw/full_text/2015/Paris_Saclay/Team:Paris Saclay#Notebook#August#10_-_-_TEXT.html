Purification by Electrophoresis
by Coralie
Agarose gel 1%, 100V
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707004 #1 and #2 (digested by EcoRI + SpeI)
BBa_K1707011 #1 (digested by XbaI +PstI)
BBa_K1707006 #1 (digested by XbaI + PstI)
BBa_K1707012 #1 (digested by XbaI + PstI)
BBa_S03518 #1 (digested by XbaI + PstI)
Verification of gel purification, from left to right: 1. Empty, 2. DNA Ladder , 3. BBa_K1707004#1, 4. BBa_K1707004#2, 5. BBa_K1707006, 6. BBa_K1707011, 7. BBa_K1707012, 8. BBa_S03518, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can conclude that:
BBa_K1707004 #1 and #2  are OK, we can cut the band
BBa_K1707006  is OK, we can cut the band
BBa_K1707011: we can't see anything on the gel
BBa_K1707012: we can't see anything on the gel
BBa_S03518: is OK, we can cut the band

Quantification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707004#1, 3. BBa_K1707004#2, 4. BBa_K1707006, 5. BBa_I13602, 6. BBa_S03518, 7. BBa_R0040, 8. BBa_R0051, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can conclude:
BBa_K1707004 #2: 20µg/µL
BBa_K1707006 #1: 30µg/µL
BBa_S03518 #1: 50µg/µL
