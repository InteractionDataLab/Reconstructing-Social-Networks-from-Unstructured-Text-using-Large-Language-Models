Soil experiment
by Audrey, Seong Koo and Johan
Plates observation and count of CFU:
Strain 1696:
Dilution 1: 490 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 67 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 0 CFU
Strain 1693:
Dilution 1: 1308 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 196 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 0 CFU
Strain 1320:
Dilution 1: 186 CFU
Dilution 0.1: 35 CFU
Dilution 0.01: 1 CFU
We take 1g of contaminated soil and treat it like yesterday to spread it on specific plates  Incubation ON, 37°C
Digestion
by Coralie
Biobrick: BBa_K1707003 #4 to #9
Digestion by EcoRI: mix
6µL EcoRI
6µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
36µL H2O
We put 8µL of the mix in each tube + 2µL of our plasmids
Digestion by EcoRI + PstI: mix
6µL EcoRI
6µL PstI
6µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
30µL H2O
We put 8µL of the mix in each tube + 2µL of our plasmids
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Johan
Agarose gel: 1% Migration 80V Biobricks: BBa_K1707003 #4 to #9 digested by EcoRI or EcoRI+PstI
Verification by digestion with EcoRI of BBa_K1707003, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #4 digested by EcorRI and PstI, 3. #5, 4. #6, 5.#7, 6. #8, 7. #9, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
Verification by digestion with EcoRI and PstI of BBa_K1707003, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #4 digested by EcorRI, 3. #5, 4. #6, 5.#7, 6. #8, 7. #9, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can't conclude anything because we inverted #4 in each gel and we forgot the control
Digestion
by Coralie
Biobricks: BBa_K1707003 #4 and #5 and BBa_B0015
Digestion by EcoRI: mix
3µL EcoRI
3µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
18µL H2O
We put 8µL of the mix in each tube + 2µL of our plasmids
Digestion by EcoRI + PstI: mix
3µL EcoRI
3µL PstI
3µL Buffer FastDigest 10x
15µL H2O
We put 8µL of the mix in each tube + 2µL of our plasmids
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
Electrophoresis
by Coralie
Agarose gel: 1% Migration 80V Biobricks: BBa_K1707003 #4 and #5 and BBa_B0015 digested by EcoRI or EcoRI+PstI
Verification by digestion of BBa_K1707003, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. #4 digested by EcorRI, 3. #5 digested by EcorRI, 4. Indicator, 5.#4 digested by EcorRI and PstI, 6. #5 digested by EcorRI and PstI, 7. Indicator, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty
We can confirm the BBa_K1707003 #4 and #5
Gel purification
by Audrey
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707002
BBa_K098997
BBa_C0051
Agarose gel 1%, migration 70V
Verification of gel purification, from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K1707002, 3. BBa_K098997, 4. BBa_C0040
We cut bands with a scalpel
Purification
by Audrey
Biobricks:
BBa_K098997
BBa_B0015
BBa_C0051
BBa_K1707002
BBa_K1707001
With PCR Clean up/Gel extraction kit from Macherey Nigel
Quantification and Verification
by Audrey
Biobricks:
Quantification:
BBa_K098997
BBa_B0015
BBa_C0051
BBa_K1707002
BBa_K1707001
Verification:
BBa_K1707000
Agarose gel 1% Migration 110V
Wells 2-6: Quantification, Well 7: Verification; from left to right: 1. DNA Ladder , 2. BBa_K098997, 3. BBa_B0015, 4. BBa_C0051, 5. BBa_K1707002, 6. BBa_K1707001, 7. K1707000 plasmid, 8. Empty, 9. Empty, 10. Empty, 11. Empty, 12. Empty
We can conclude that the BBa_K1707000 PCR is ok. So the biobrick is confirmed
