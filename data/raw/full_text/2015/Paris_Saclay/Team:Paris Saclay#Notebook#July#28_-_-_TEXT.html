Soil experiment
by Audrey, Johan and Coralie
Soil
We put 100µL of each culture on MacConkey plate with specific antbiotic (Control +):
1696: Tetracyclin
1693: Spectinomycine
1320: Chloramphenicol
We put 30 mL of each culture in 60g of non sterile soil in a pot.
1696: 3 pots
1693: 3 pots
1320: 3 pots
We put 30 mL of clean LB in 60g of non sterile soil in a pot (Control -)
LB: 3 pots
After this contamination, we take 1g of each pot to make the J0 measurement. We dilute it in 5mL of sterile H2O, and shake it during 5 min. Then, we let it to decant during 15 min.  We take 50µL of the supernatant, and dilute it  in 950µL of Sterile H2O (complete dilution from the soil is now at 10-2) We put 100µL of this previous dilution on plates that fits. We incubate plates over night at 37°C
Pots are placed in trays: 1 strain by tray. Trays are covered by a shrink-wrap, and we let them in room temperature
Water
We test two different water: seawater, from the Atlantic ocean, and stagnant water from Orsay's pool. For each water, we make dilutions: 10-1, 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 We 100µL of different dilution on each type of plate:
LB without antibiotic
LB + Spectinomycin
LB + tetracyclin
LB + Chloramphenicol
MacConkey without antibiotic
MacConkey + Spectinomycin
MacConkey + Tetracyclin
MacConkey + Chloramphenicol
We incubate plates over night at 37°C
New culture
by Pauline
Biobricks:
BBa_K1707008
BBa_K1707010
We take 2 colony of each, and put it in 5mL of LB + 20µg/mL Chloramphenicol Incubation 37°C, 250 rpm
