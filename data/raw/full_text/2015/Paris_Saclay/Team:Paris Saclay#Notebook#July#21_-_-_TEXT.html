by Coralie and Johan In each tube:
10 µL plasmid
1µL of each enzyme
1 µL FastDigest Buffer (10x)
6 µL H2O
BBa_K1707001: SpeI and EcoRI

BBa_R0051: SpeI and PstI
BBa_K098997: EcoRI and SpeI
Incubation 1h30, 37°C
Observation plates from soil experiment
by Seong Koo and Johan
On all MacConkey plates: we can't see anything On LB+antibiotics plates: we can't see anything On LB plates without antibiotics with 10^-5 and 10^-6 dilutions: we can't see anything On LB plates without antibiotics with 10^-2, 10^^-3 and 10^-4 dilutions: we see some colonies
Purification on electrophoresis gel
by Johan and Audrey
BBa_K1707002
BBa_K1707003 #1 and #2
BBa_K098997
Agarose gel, 1% Migration: 80V
BBa_K1707003: the digestion doesn't work. We will try other clones from the transformation
We cut bands of BBa_K1707002 and BBa_K098997 with a scalpel.

New Culture
by Coralie
BBa_K1707003
We put in culture 10 clones of this Biobrick in 2mL LB + 2µL Cm
Soil Experiment
by Johan and Coralie We put 5g of soil samples in plates.
We mesure OD600 of our cultures:
1320 - ClpP::Cm : OD600=1,32
1696 - Bad::tetra : OD600=1,12
1693 MG1655Z1 : OD600=1.25
In each plate, we put 1mL of one of those strain:
1320
1696
1693
in one of those dilution: 1, 0,1 or 0,01
At t=0, we take 1g of contamined soil, we mixed it with 5mL of steril water, we take the supernatant, dilute it at 10^-2, and put 100µL on each MacConkey plate with the right antibiotic to allow each strain to growth.
We incubate plates at 37°C one night
Control +: We put 100µL of each strain directly on their right plate, without touching the soil Control -: We extract the soil without any contamination and put 100µL of the 10^-2 dilution on a MacConkey plate
