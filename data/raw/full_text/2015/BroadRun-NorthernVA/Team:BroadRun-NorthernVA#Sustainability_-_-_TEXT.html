Sustainability
Armstrong’s issue with microbial growth and butyric acid production has been ongoing, but has worsened greatly since the company switched from using tree pulp, to recycled paper products, in their ceiling tile manufacturing process. This change was a part of their new “green” initiative to reduce their footprint on the world.
Yet, their attempts at sustainability had unwanted consequences
The recycled paper products, having been already processed once to make pulp required for paper manufacturing, are full of short chain cellulose fibers, whereas tree pulp contains long chain cellulose fibers. These short chain cellulose fibers are not always fully incorporated into the ceiling tiles and end up in the water system. Microbes feed off the cellulose fibers and produce butyric acid.
Armstrong’s current solution is to use harmful biocides that kill all microbial growth. Yet this solution is only short term, as the microbes simply grow back. Additionally there is always a risk of contaminating the water system with harmful chemicals designed to destroy microorganisms.
Our solution was to engineer yeast cells that could produce and secrete amylase. This solution is long term, the yeast will continue to reproduce and break down the starch molecules. Unlike the biocides, the yeast cells pose no threat to the environment, wildlife, or humans. With our cost effective and sustainable solution, Armstrong can continue with its sustainability initiatives, without unpleasant consequences, or risking environmental safety with dangerous biocides.
