We would like to thank our financial sponsor, Armstrong, for supporting our Broad Run iGEM team. We are indebted to your generosity for full coverage of our $4,500 registration fee to be a 2015 iGEM team. Without your generous financial assistance, our iGEM research project would not have been possible. 
</FONT></LI></UL><FONT size="4">We would like to extend our thanks to Frederick Schaufeld, founder of SwanLegend, for providing us with $2,500 to cover costs of the iGEM Jamboree. We are so grateful of your generosity and willingness to assist our endeavors into synthetic biology. Without your support, our trip to the Jamboree would not be possible. 
<FONT size="4">We would like to thank our financial sponsor, Telos, for your invaluable support of our iGEM Team and STEM in Loudoun County. We are ever so grateful of your generosity and for providing us with $2,500 to cover the costs of registration of the iGEM Jamboree and accommodation. Special thanks to John Wood and Lisa Kimball, our trip to Boston would not be possible without your generosity and kindness.

The Baltimore Underground Science Space (BUGSS) is a DIY community hackerspace. Dr.Tom Burkett, founder of BUGSS, provided us with the lab space and equipment to complete the project, and many of the materials, reagents, and enzymes needed for the project. Their synthetic biology based Build-A-Gene class, taught by Dr.Lisa Scheifele helped some of our team members to learn the lab skills and knowledge needed for iGEM. The expert advice and mentorship we received through BUGSS, and the time given up by Dr.Burkett and Dr.Scheifele on many days in the summer and through September so that we could complete our iGEM research project were invaluable.<P><FONT size="4">
We would like to thank Sigma Aldrich for providing us with a starch assay kit at no cost. Thank you Brenda Taylor and Willard Jackson for responding to our requests and shipping the kit to us so soon.

We would like to thank Integrated DNA Technologies for synthesizing our gene constructs and primers at no cost.
