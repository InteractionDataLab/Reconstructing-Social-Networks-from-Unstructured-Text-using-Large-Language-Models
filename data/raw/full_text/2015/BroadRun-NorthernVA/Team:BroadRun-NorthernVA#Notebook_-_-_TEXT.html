Lab Notebook
Welcome to our Lab Notebook!  Here, we have documented the work done in our project so we can see and keep track of how our project is progressing.
June
Week 1
Brainstormed ideas for projects. Decided on cells that could break down starch.
Week 2-4
Researched the best way to go about this solution.
Saccharomyces was decided as our organism, because of it ability to thrive in a variety of conditions, both aerobic and anaerobic.
Used alpha amylase as our target gene to be cloned
July
More literature research and worked on developing protocols.  Ordered materials for the project, enzymes, reagents, buffers, kits, agar plates, LB broth, etc.
Experiment details were solidified and planned out in more detail.
Ordered materials for the project, enzymes, reagents, buffers, kits, agar plates, LB broth, etc.

No spacing was needed in between the composite parts, all constructs were optimized for S.cerevisiae, and an extra eight bases were added before the Ecor1 restriction site and after the pst1 restriction site, in order to increase the efficiency of the enzyme.
Designed primers for the three gene constructs, by hand using New England Biolabs Tm calculator. Primers were named p01, p02, p03, and p04.
p01- left primer for construct 1
p02 - right primer for construct 1
p03- left primer for construct 2 and 3
p01- right primer for construct 2 and 3
Week 2
The gene constructs and primers were first resuspended, according to protocol.
Primer resuspension: Amount of water added to reach 100uM concentration, water was added and pipetted up and down to resuspend.
p01: 293 µl of water
p02: 336 µl of water
p03: 269 µl of water
p04: 345 µl of water
100uM concentration was then diluted to 10uM concentration.   Gene construct resuspension: 100 µl of TE buffer was added to each gene construct and pipetted up and down and vortexed to resuspend.  Tubes were then incubated at 30 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes.
Then we amplified the DNA with the primers using PCR.

Ran a gel to confirm size.
Gel Electrophoresis
10µl of each PCR reaction was added into ten different tubes and 2µl of loading dye added.
11µl was then loaded into each of the wells and ran for 15 minutes.
Week 3

After ligation, we completed a bacterial transformation and plated cultures on agar plates.
Week 4
The PCR mix components were combined in a large microcentrifuge tube with:
100µl of 2x master mix
16µl of VF2 primer
13 µl of VR primer
71 µl of sterile water
20µl of the mix was added into each of nine PCR tubes.
Three colonies were chosen from each of the pSB1c3 ligations that had been transformed into the E.coli, labeled 1A,1B,1C, 2A, so forth. Each colony was mixed into the PCR mix and then streaked onto a master plate.
10µl of the finished PCR product was mixed with 2µl of loading dye and loaded into a agarose gel.
The results confirmed that our insert size was correct
Next, we mini-prepped our liquid cultures using Quiaprep mini prep kit. There were eighteen cultures total, three colonies for each of the five transformations.
After the mini prep, we needed to check the size of the DNA and the DNA had not been lost during the miniprep.  To linearize the DNA, 5µl was added to 45 µl of a master mix.
Two master mixes were used, one with EcoR1 and one with Spe1. The ligations with the pSB1C3 plasmid and yeast vector pRS426 contain a single EcoR1 restriction site and the pAG36 yeast vector contains a Spe1 restriction site. Master mix with Ecor1 was made for 15 reactions and the Spe1 master mix for 5 reactions.
Master mix:
Ecor1 mix:
75 µl 10x New England Bio Labs Cut Smart Buffer
15 µl EcoR1 enzyme
585 µl distilled water
Spe1 mix:
25 µl 10x New England Bio Labs Cut Smart Buffer
5 µl Spe1 enzyme
195 µl distilled water
DNA was incubated at 37° Celsius for one hour.
10 µl of loading dye was added, the solution was pipetted up and down to mix thoroughly.
20µl was loaded into each well in addition to a 1kb DNA ladder.

Project Timeline
Week 1
Colony PCR on bacterial cultures
Made liquid cultures of positive colonies
Miniprepped liquid cultures
Transformed DNA samples into S.cerevisiae
Week 2
Tested genetically engineered cells for ability to produce amylase and hydrolyze starch
Cells were tested in known concentrations of soluble starch dissolved in water
Iodine was used to determine starch concentrations
Then the yeast cells were tested in a sample of Armstrong's factory water
Week 3
Cells were heat killed at 80 degrees Celsius to inactivate enzymes.
Ran through a gel to verify the fragments
Ligation of gene after successful gel.
Week 4
Today we ran colony PCR to confirm the insert size. Our bacterial transformations went well, and we had both liquid cultures and agar plates with the colonies. The synthesized primers from IDT for the yeast vectors have not arrived, so colony PCR was done only on the three transformations with the pSB1c3 vector.
Week 5
Colony PCR
Starch Analysis
