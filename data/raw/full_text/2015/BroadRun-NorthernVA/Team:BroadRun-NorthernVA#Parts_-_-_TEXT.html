Parts Description:
ADH1 Terminator- This part is the terminator region from yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) gene. This stops the RNA polymerase from transcribing the RNA sequence.
Kozak Sequence- This part initiates translation from eukaryotic mRNA and is cloned between a promoter and coding region to facilitate translation.
cyc minimal promoter- This part is the center of the CYC1 promoter, S. cerevisiae. This promoter allows basal transcription, and the transcription signal can be modulated by adding operator sites upstream of this BioBrick. This allows activators or repressors to act on the transcription machinery.
Mating Factor Alpha Secretion Sequence- This part is the secretion signal from yeast α-mating factor, and directs the secretion of the produced protein. This allows the exportation of the protein.
Alpha Amylase- Obtained from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, α-Amylase is a protein enzyme that hydrolyses alpha bonds of large, alpha-linked polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen.
Native Alpha Amylase Secretion Sequence A signal sequence which directs the protein to be secreted.
