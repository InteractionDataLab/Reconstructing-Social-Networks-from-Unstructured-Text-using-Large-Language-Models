Broad Run Northern VA Team
Captain and Founder
Marissa Sumathipala is a sophomore at Broad Run High School, and founder of the Broad Run Northern VA iGEM team. She is a 2015 National BioGENEius Finalist and top winner at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium for her research on the long term epigenetics of agrochemicals and increased expression of FOXO transcription factor and high fat/sugar diets on age-related cardiac decline, both modeled in fruit flies. Marissa approaches science research with a rational mindset, reading, observing and constantly analyzing to advance herself and the world in this new and upcoming field. She is also a competitive freestyle skater. In her free time, Marissa enjoys, writing and reading novels, performing fruit fly heart surgeries, photography, and playing field hockey.
