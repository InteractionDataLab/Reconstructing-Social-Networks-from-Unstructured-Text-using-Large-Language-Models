The project initiation was solely the efforts of  our team member captains. Project topic decisions were made by the team with advice from our mentors.  Our team captains were responsible for keeping the project on track, and initiating efforts to secure funding and conducting public education and outreach. All lab work was conducted by our team. We'd like to thank all those who have helped us over the summer, not only for making iGEM possible but also for making it incredibly fun.
Baltimore Underground Science Space Dr. Tom Burkett - Founder of Baltimore Underground Science Space -  Advised our project selection, supervised our lab-work, assisted in designing our gene constructs, provided us with enzymes, reagents, buffers and other materials needed for our experiments, and ensured our experiments were properly designed and carried out safely.
Dr. Lisa Scheifele - Biology professor at Loyola University- Mentored our project, gave expert advice on our practices in the lab, assisted in designing our gene constructs, yeast transformations, and understanding of lab equipment, and provided us with two yeast vectors for our research.
