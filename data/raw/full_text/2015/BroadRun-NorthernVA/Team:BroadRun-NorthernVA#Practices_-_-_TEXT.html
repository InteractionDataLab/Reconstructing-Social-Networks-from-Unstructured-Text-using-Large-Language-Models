Human Practices Overview
Armstrong is currently facing a problem with the build-up of starches in their system. This buildup results from their decision to manufacture ceiling tiles made mostly from recycled material. The starch buildup creates problems with unwanted bacterial growth which is expensive to fix and leaves a foul stench in the air. The consequences of Armstrong’s eco-friendly endeavors are costly and discouraging. Our team is using synthetic biology to eliminate these consequences in hope of not only relieving this burden from Armstrong, but to show future companies that switching to eco-friendly systems doesn’t have to come with drawbacks.
