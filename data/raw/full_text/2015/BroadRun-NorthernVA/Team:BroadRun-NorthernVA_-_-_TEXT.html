Welcome to the 2015 Broad Run High School iGEM team's Wiki!
We are Broad Run High School's first ever iGEM team, formed by our two captains Marissa Sumathipala and Adriel Sumathipala, and one of Loudoun County's first ever teams.   We have a geographically diverse team, spanning two states and three different school districts, united by our passion for synthetic biology and intellectual curiosity.
