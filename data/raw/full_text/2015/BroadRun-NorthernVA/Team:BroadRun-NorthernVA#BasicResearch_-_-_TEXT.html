Basic Research
The developments and ideas from our project has a multitude of solutions outside of an industrial water system.
It has especial value in terms of renewable sources of energy. Amylases can be used to break down some organic material into butanol and to break down and ferment organic materials, such as crop waste, into ethanol, both sustainable energy alternatives to fossil fuels. For example, farmers could use corn husks or other organic materials that arenâ€™t sold, to produce ethanol or butanol.
Amylase enzymes are often used in laundry detergents, thus a cheap way of producing an isolating a highly effective amylase, such as the alpha amylase used in this project, would be valuable in creating more effective detergent. Amylase-producing yeast has many uses in the food processing industry. Amylases are used extensively in the production of high fructose corn syrup, to break down the starches to sugars. It could be also used to enhance baking bread.
