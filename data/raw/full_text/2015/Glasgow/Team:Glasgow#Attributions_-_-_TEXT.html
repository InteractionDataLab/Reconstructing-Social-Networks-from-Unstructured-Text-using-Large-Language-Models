Supervisors/Advisors
Dr Sean Colloms. (Lecturer in Synthetic Biology, Institute of Molecular Cell and Systems Biology, University of Glasgow) Our primary supervisor - basically gave up his summer! Demonstrated and advised on lab techniques and equipment, oligo/g-block design advice, sequencing analysis advice, wiki advice.
Dr Julien Reboud (Lord Kelvin Adam Smith Fellow in Synthetic Biology, Biomedical Engineering, University of Glasgow) Adviser: advice on all things engineering, wiki advice
Dr Steph Holt. Advisor: Demonstrated and advised on lab techniques and equipment. Proof-reading saviour. Eternal optimism!
Their help and support throughout the whole project was invaluable - without them, none of this would be possible!
General Support
Everyone in the Bower Building, University of Glasgow, for their support over the summer.
Glasgow Science Centre, for allowing us to participate  in the Meet the Experts event.
Hyndland School, for allowing Lab Skills and Advanced Higher students to visit our lab, and hear about iGEM.
Queen Margaret Union, for much needed lunch and coffee breaks.
