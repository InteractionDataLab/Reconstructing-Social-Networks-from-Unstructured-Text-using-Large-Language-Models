I’m Andrey, a 22-year-old Genetics student at the University of Glasgow. Taking part in the University’s iGEM team has been an amazing and incredibly rewarding experience. Thanks to my supervisors and teammates I learned how to take care of a lab and conduct experiments, while surrounded by love and positivity. This have helped me maintain a genuine and long-lasting attraction to Biological Sciences. I hope this experience helps me become a Dr. Dre of Life Sciences.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H2 class="featurette-heading">Ye Yang<SPAN class="text-muted">Studies: Biomedical Engineering</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">Hi, my name is Ye Yang, and in my most of the lab time, I'm coding with our wiki pages. I'm quite happy with this experience, apparently before iGEM I have no idea how to deal with the website things, but after the whole summer learning HTML, CSS, I think now I can play with it. For my future plan about my study career, I'm trying to do well in GRE test, and hoping to study in an American school next year.  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7 col-md-push-5"><H2 class="featurette-heading">Adele Cook<SPAN class="text-muted">Studies: Biomedical Engineering</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">Hi guys, my name's Adele! I've been working mainly on Photography and Product Design for this project, but also on Human Practices - in other words, anything that's not biology -  leave that to those who know what they're talking about! Not that I don't love biology - in fact, once I graduate from Biomedical Engineering it's my dream to go on to medical school to become a doctor one day - wish me luck! iGEM has taught me a wealth of new lab skills and knowledge about synthetic biology, but most importantly, to know when not to have another can of Red Bull.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H2 class="featurette-heading">Charlotte Flynn<SPAN class="text-muted">Studies: Genetics</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">Hi, I’m Charlotte!

This summer participating in iGEM has taught me how to effectively use time in the lab and has greatly strengthened my experimental technique.

After my forth year I plan to do a PhD and then take time out to travel the world and share valuable life experiences with those close to me.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7 col-md-push-5"><H2 class="featurette-heading">Vilija Lomeikaitė<SPAN class="text-muted">Studies: Genetics</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">Hi, I’m Vilija!

Thanks to the iGEM and despite all the rain, I had the best summer of learning, falling in love with science and making friends with these crazy and sweet people known as my teammates and supervisors. After graduation, I plan to use iGEM experience and successfully utilise E. coli in the synthesis of the Philosopher’s stone. Or do a PhD – I’m still trying to decide!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H2 class="featurette-heading"> Dimitra Lountzi<SPAN class="text-muted">Studies: Genetics</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">Hello, I'm Dimitra and I'm one of the geneticists in the team!

Team Glasgow for IGEM 2015 has been an amazing experience. I have learned how to plan ahead and work efficiently in a scientific environment along side my other team members, who have all become good friends. After I graduate, I plan on taking some time out of studying to travel and see the world, and then return to do a PhD. In the future I hope to work in Cancer or Cardiovascular Research.
