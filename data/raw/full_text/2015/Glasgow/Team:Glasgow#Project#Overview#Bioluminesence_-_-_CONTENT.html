In this section of our project we aimed to engineer bacteria that are capable of producing bioluminescence. We were greatly inspired by the work of the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Bioluminescence/Bacterial_Luciferases">Cambridge iGEM team from 2010</A>, and used some of their research as a starting point for our own. Their project featured the Lux Operon <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K325909">K325909</A>, originally from <I>Vibrio fischeri</I>, comprising of six lux genes that when expressed are capable of producing bioluminescence. These genes were <I>luxC, luxD</I> and <I>luxE</I> encoding three enzymes that act together to produce tetradecanal in the cell, and <I>luxA</I> and <I>luxB</I> which when expressed can use the decanal to produce luciferase and therefore bioluminescence. The final gene in the operon is <I>luxG</I>, which is thought to enhance the brightness of the bioluminescence, by producing reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) which is required for bacterial luminescence.
</P><H2>Our Aims</H2><P class="mainText">
In 2010, the Cambridge iGEM team isolated the lux operon from <I>V.fischeri</I>, it was decided that our team would characterise the lux genes individually for submission to the registry. The Cambridge 2010 iGEM team used the native <I>V. fischeri lux</I> operon; each lux gene in the operon had its own (<I>V. fisheri</I>) ribosome binding site and the genes were in the order <I>luxCDABEG</I> (Figure 1). We aimed to reconstruct the lux operon for optimal performance using Biobrick assembly, changing the order of the <I>lux</I> genes from <I>luxCDABEG</I> (Figure 1) to <I>luxABGCDE</I> (Figure 2), and using a defined biobrick ribosome binding site (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0032">B0032</A>) for each gene in the operon. Our team originally aimed to engineer a <I>luxABGCDE</I> operon biobrick with no promoter, so that we could drive expression from the promoter in our inverter, or future iGEM teams could add their own promoter. We also wanted to make a test operon controlled by the arabinose regulated pBAD promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I0500">BBa_I0500</A>) to directly compare to K325909, and separately a construct where tetradecanal production was regulated independently from the light production enzymes LuxA, LuxB and LuxG. To do this we aimed to place <I>luxABG</I> under the control of the BBa_I0500 and <I>luxCDE</I> under the control of the IPTG-regulated pL-lac promoter, BBa_K1725080.

To begin, we created primers for the individual <I>lux</I> genes. All of the forward primers were made to contain the BioBrick prefix, the B0032 RBS and a BioBrick Scar preceding the ATG of the open reading frame. All of the reverse primers incorporated the BioBrick suffix sequence. Our primers were used to carry out PCR using biobrick K325909 as a template, yielding the six individual <I>lux</I> genes (Figure 3). Once each of the genes was successfully isolated by PCR, they were digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated individually into the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone and transformed individually into Top10 <I>E. coli</I> cells. The plasmids isolated from these ligations went on to become our first biobricks submitted for the Bioluminescence section:

•	<A href="”" http:="">K1725207</A> – B0032.<I>luxB</I>

•	<A href="”" http:="">K1725211</A> – B0032.<I>luxG</I></P><H2>Creating <A href="”" http:="">K1725216</A> (<I>luxABG</I>) </H2><P class="mainText test2">
(TOP10 cells were used for all transformations using these genes) 
The <I>luxA</I> gene was inserted upstream of  <I>luxB</I> using AlwNI, SpeI and XbaI, different restriction enzymes from <A href="”http://parts.igem.org/Assembly:Standard_assembly”">BioBrick Standard Assembly</A> method, this method utilised the compatibility of SpeI and XbaI restriction sites (figure 4).    DNA extracted from transformants from this ligation   were tested by restriction digest and agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of the desired construct K1725212 (B0032,<I>luxA</I>, B0032, <I>luxB</I>).

The arabinose-regulated promoter (BBa_I0500)   was inserted into K1725212 upstream of <I>luxA</I> to  demonstrate that when <I>luxA</I> and <I>luxB</I> were expressed and decanal was sprayed on the lid of the plate and allowed to diffuse across the plate, the cells produce bioluminescence (Figure  5). This was done again using AlwNI and SpeI to cut pSB1C3 (BBa_I0500), and AlwNI and XbaI to cut pSB1C3 (BBa_K1725212), creating pSB1C3 (BBa_K1725214; pBAD/araC, B0032, <I>luxA</I>, B0032, <I>luxB</I>) . Once transformed, 4 separate colonies were re-streaked onto plates containing arabinose, and the same 4 colonies re-streaked onto plates without arabinose. Non-arabinose plates were used as a control to show that <I>luxA</I> and <I>luxB</I> were both switched off when the promoter is not induced.
<CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 3: Assembly of <I>LuxAB</I> vector:
pSP1C3 containing BBa¬¬_K1725206 (<I>luxA</I>) was cut with AlwNI and SpeI and ligated with pSP1C3 containing BBa_K1725207 (<I>luxB</I>) digested with AlwNI and XbaI. This ligation is possible due to the compatibility of the SpeI and XbaI restriction sites; however both sites are destroyed in the construction.  
</FIGCAPTION></CENTER>
The next step for making the desired construct was to insert <I> luxG</I> into pSB1C3 (BBa_K1725212) and into pSB1C3 (BBa_K1725214) downstream of <I>luxB</I> using the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Assembly:Standard_assembly">biobrick standard assembly</A> method. However, ligation of the <I>luxG</I> gene was unsuccessful, and after two attempts, due to time constraints, it was decided that <I>luxG</I> would be omitted from the final construct.

 For assembly of <I>luxCD</I>,  it was decided to insert  <I>luxC</I> upstream of <I>luxD</I> in the same way as for <I> LuxAB</I>,  using  AlwNI and SpeI to cut  pSP1C3 containing BBa¬¬_K1725208 (<I>luxC</I>), and AlwN1 and Xba1 to cut pSP1C3 containing BBa_K1725209 (<I>luxD</I>) (figure 5). The ligation was successfully transformed into TOP10.

pSP1C3 containing BBa¬¬_K1725208 (<I>luxC</I>) was cut with AlwNI and SpeI and ligated with pSP1C3 containing BBa_K1725209 (<I>luxD</I>) digested with AlwNI and XbaI. This ligation is possible due to the compatibility of the SpeI and XbaI restriction sites; however both sites are destroyed in the construction.</FIGCAPTION></CENTER>
The next step was to insert a promoter upstream of <I>luxCD</I>, as we had planned to measure the levels of tetradecanal produced when   <I>luxC, luxD</I> and <I>luxE</I> were expressed. We decided to use the  IPTG-inducible pL-lac promoter (BBa_K1725080), which was inserted upstream of  <I>luxCD</I> and transformed into TOP10 cells. However, no colonies were obtained. It was hypothesised that due to the absence of a lac repressor in Top10, the <I>luxCD</I> plasmid was being constitutively expressed. Constitutive expression of this plasmid may be harmful to the cell and could be preventing colony formation.  To overcome this, we decided to transform <I>luxCD</I> without a promoter into DS941.Z1 (genotype on our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Glasgow/Project/Overview/Protocols">Protocols</A> page) as this strain highly expresses the lac repressor protein. However, DNA from TOP10 is unmethlyated, so if it was transformed directly into DS941.Z1, the restriction system would digest the DNA and it would not tranform. Therefore, the DNA from TOP10 was first transformed into DH5α (which has the same methylation system as DS941.Z1, but doesn’t have the restriction system) which methylated the DNA for subsequent transformation into DS941.Z1.

IPTG-inducible pL-lac promoter (BBa_K1725080) was inserted upstream of the <I>luxCD</I> plasmid (BBa_K175215), using the restriction enzymes AlwNI, XbaI and SpeI as previously described, creating (BBa_K1725215). In a separate construction, <I>luxE</I> was inserted downstream of <I>luxCD</I>, creating <I>luxCDE</I>  (BBa_K1725222). 

A final ligation was set up to insert <I>luxE</I> downstream of <I>luxCD</I> under the control of the IPTG-inducible pL-lac promoter (BBa_K1725215), creating <I>luxCDE</I> under control of the pL-lac promoter (BBa_K1725219).  Plasmid constructs were transformed into DH5 cells.

</P><H2> Creating Final Products</H2><P class="Maintext">
For the final product all that was left to do was to ligate <I>luxAB</I> to <I>luxCDE</I>, bearing in mind <I>luxG</I> was intended to have been included, but proved too difficult. <I>luxCDE</I> was inserted downstream of <I>LuxAB</I> and also I0500<I>luxAB</I> so that we could compare this construct to our BioBrick of the lux operon with optimised RBS (more detail on our <A href="”" https:="">RBS library</A> page):

•	<A href="”" http:="">K1725223</A> - <I>luxABCDE</I> (Figure 6)

•	<A href="”" http:="">K1725224</A> - I0500.<I>luxABCDE</I><CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 6. Final construct K1725223 in pSB1C3.</FIGCAPTION></CENTER>
We tested K1725224 (I0500.<I>luxABCDE</I>) compared to the original K325909 (<I>luxCDABEG</I>), three colonies with different brightness from our RBS library bioluminescence Biobricks, and K1725223 (<I>luxABCDE</I>) as a negative control, as shown in Figure 7.
<CENTER><FIGCAPTION>Figure 7. Left to right: Bright colony from our RBS library (K1725350 - I0500.<I>luxABG</I> - in pSB1C3 and K1725351 - K1725080.<I>luxCDE</I> - in pSB3K3); K325909 in pSB1C3; K1725224 (I0500.<I>luxABCDE</I>) in pSB1C3; medium colony from RBS library (plasmids identical to bright colony, except different RBS); dim colony from RBS library (plasmids identical to bright colony, except different RBS); K1725223 (<I>luxABCDE</I>). All in TOP10 cells, and induced with 1% arabinose.</FIGCAPTION></CENTER>
Evidently, the absence of <I>luxG</I> reduces the brightness of the bioluminescence. This supports our hypothesis that expression of <I>luxG</I> is important for optimising the brightness of the lux operon in <I>E. coli</I>.
