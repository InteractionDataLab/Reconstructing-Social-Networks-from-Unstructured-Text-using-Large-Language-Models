In order to investigate how much do the public know about cadmium element so that we can predict the social effect of our products. We released a questionnaire named The research of people’s knowledge level about cadmium. Here is the content of the questionnaire and the report of data analysis and summary.</P><H3>The research of people’s knowledge level about cadmium</H3><H3><P>
1. Do you know the concept of heavy metal? (Single Choice)
A. Metal with a specific gravity greater than 5, which means the relative density is above 5. And it is always harmful to people’s health.
B. Same as familiar metal like Na+ and K+，which is needed to body.
C. High density metal.
D. Have no idea about it.
2. Which of the following elements do you think is harmful to the human body? (Multiple Choice)
A. Hg+
B .Cd+
C. Pb+
D. Au+
E. Unclear

A.From school books.
B.From extracurricular reading.
C.From the propaganda of the government departments.
D.Do not know anything about heavy metal.
4.Do you know the cause of Itai－Itai Disease that happened in Japan in 1970s?(Single Choice)
A.Cu+ poisoning
B.Hg+ poisoning
C.Cd+ poisoning
D.Li+ poisoning
E.Unclear
5.Do you think that cadmium is far from our daily life?(Single Choice)
A. Yes, cadmium exists only in the mine, nuclear power plant, metal smelting plant and other industrial processes.
B. No, Water, air, articles for daily use may contain cadmium 
C. Unclear
6.Which of the following articles for daily use do you think may contain cadmium ion?(Multiple Choice)
A.Cosmetics 
B.Electric contact of domestic appliance switch
C.Rechargeable battery
D.Insecticide and Bactericide
E. Aquatic products
7.Have you ever taken your drinking water or domestic water to related departments to detect the content of heavy metal?(Single Choice)
A.Regularly
B.Never
8.What is the main reason for you that you could not submit drinking water or domestic water to testing centers at regular intervals?(Multiple Choice)
A. Lacking of testing organizations to provide such services.
B. The detection costs a lot of time and money.
C. The procedure of sending a sample to related departments is too complicated.
D. Not so necessary.
9.If there is a detecting product with the advantage of simple operation, sensitivity of detection and being able to adsorb cadmium ion, would you be willing to use it?(Single Choice)
A. Yes, I do.
B. No, I don’t.</P></H3><H3>Data analysis and summary</H3><P>
To begin with, the public have a certain understanding of heavy metal such as cadmium. They know that these kinds of metal are harmful to us. However, the potential harm has not been known thoroughly by them. Although cadmium seems to be closed to human, the public do not know the specific objects that maybe containing cadmium ion. The most dangerous thing is that most of us ignore the importance of measuring the content of cadmium surrounding us because of high cost on money and time, the fussy processes and lacking organization which can provide the measurement service. Therefore, when we provide the public with such product that can be controlled handily, detect the cadmium sensitively and be able to absorb it, they will be willing to accept this product.
From question 1 to question 3, we could get the information that 86.44% of people investigated have a clear understanding about heavy metal. Most of them gain the knowledge from school books or from extracurricular reading. Just a small number of people learn it from the propaganda of the government departments，which indicates that the government has not paid enough attention to the cadmium ion pollution, and the strength of propaganda and education is not enough.

The statistical result of question 4 tells us that only 59.32% of people investigated have ever known about Itai－Itai Disease. So we can deduce that not so many people have a thorough understanding about the harm of cadmium ion. What we should do is to let more people join us to defend against cadmium ion pollution.
From question 5 to question 6, we could know that 74.58% of people investigated realize that cadmium is close to our daily life, but there are still a part of them do not even know where cadmium ion will possibly exists. Few people know that electric contact of domestic appliance switch，insecticide and bactericide and aquatic products which are frequently used maybe polluted with cadmium.
The information from the result of question 7 and question 8 shows that 93.22% of people investigated have never taken their drinking water and domestic water to related departments to detect the content of heavy metal. The main reason is lacking testing organizations to provide such services. The other reasons are mostly about the inconvenience of the detection job like high cost of time and money. That is why we put forward a convenient and quick way to solve this problem.
In general, people know the harm about cadmium ion, but they do not know the specific objects that maybe containing cadmium element. As biological learners，we are supposed to take the responsibility of telling the public the risk of cadmium pollution and keeping them away from it. We understand that it will cost a lot if government sectors use original method to help the public, so we have designed a product to solve this problem. It can be controlled handily, detect the cadmium sensitively and be able to absorb it. With so many advantages, people will be very willing to use it.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER id="footer1" style="border-top:5px solid #e1472f;"><DIV class="centered-wrapper"><DIV id="topfooter"><DIV class="one-half"><H3>About Us</H3><P class="percent-two-third">
