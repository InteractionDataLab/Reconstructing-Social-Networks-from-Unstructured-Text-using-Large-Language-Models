Overview
Aiming to detect the cadmium ion as sensitive as possible, we bulit up  the sensor system in our engineering E.coli. With the help of synthetic biology technology, we gave the engineering bacterium a dual function: monitoring the amount of cadmium in real time, and adsorbing it if it exceeded a certain level.
After a series of experiments and adequate comparisons, we got the following data and information：
When the cadmium ion concentration was below 3×10-8mol/L, the bacteria would be displayed in green in about 24~48 hours. When the concentration of cadmium ion in the water environment was higher than the detection limit（3×10-8mol/L）, the bacteria would change into red in 3 hours . Meanwhile, cadmium ion would be adsorbed on the surface of the cell.
Since the time that the engineering bacteria cost to turn green was a bit long and it was not so easy for eyes to duly observe a color change, we came to a conclusion that if the bacterium do not turn red within 3 hours, we could assume that the concentration of cadmium ion of the water samples to be tested was below 3×10-8mol/L.
Figure 1: Specific pathways and components mentioned above are shown.
There are two kinds of channel proteins about cadmium ion, including YiiP and ZntA. They transport cadmium iron from extracellular to intracellular.
MerR is an repressor to PcadA. When the cadmium ion concentration is below 10-8 mol/L ,MerR keeps the inhibition of PcadA. Therefore, tetR  cannot be activated and the inhibitory effect of tetR on Ptet relieved and it works, then cjBlue expresses. The result is that the engineering bacterium turn green.
Otherwise，the combination of MerR and cadmium ion can relieve the Inhibition effect of PcadA, which makes the downstream gene expressed.
（1）Expression of RFP: the engineering bacterium turn red.
（2）Expression of CsgA-ECs :CsgA-ECs protein is assembled on the surface of the engineering bacterium, and then begins to adsorb cadmium ion.
（3）Expression of TerR:Ptet and the downstream gene is repressed, so that the color of cjBlue vanish gradually.
Introduction
These are the introduction of parts used in the sensor system.
CadA promoter: CadA promoter is sensitive to cadmium ion, which can be repressed by MerR. In high concentration of cadmium ion, the Cd2+ can rapidly bind with MerR and eliminate its inhibition of CadA promoter. In low concentration shows diametrically opposite.
MerR :MerR(wild type),a mercury-sensing regulatory protein, which regulates mercury resistance operons in Gram-negative bacteria, is subjected to directed evolution in an effect to generate a MerR mutant that responds to Cadmium ion but not mercury.[1]That is, the MerR mutant is the cadmium-sensing regulatory protein. To get MerR mutant, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis is used to introduce random mutations into the key metal-binding regions of MerR. Finally, Getting the generated Cd-specific MerR mutants appears to be unique.
TetR:TetR family is made up of 47 amino residues. Its structure is helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif and adjacent regions in the three-dimensional structure.[2]TetR can bound to the target operator represses tetA transcription and is released in the presence of tetracycline. In the project, we use tetR as a repressor of Ptet.
YiiP/ZntA: YiiP is a representative member of the cation diffusion facilitator(CDF)family , a class of ubiquitous metal transporters that play an essential role in metal homeostasis. Up to now, a pair of Zn2+/Cd2+—selective binding sites has been localized to two highly conserved as partyly residues(Asp157), each in a 2-fold-symmetry –related transmembrane segment 5 of a YiiP homodimer. Each monomeric subunit contains six transmembrane segments with both N and C terminal located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. As partly residues are frequently found in metal binding clusters where they bridge a pair of metal ions by providing two oxygen ligands, each interacting with one of the two adjacent metal ions. [3]So, the YiiP can serve as the channel that binds and cooperative transport cadmium ion.
ZntA is homologous to YiiP. It can translocate the cadmium ion from the outer cell to inner cell that utilizes the free energy derived from the cytosolic ATP.
CjBlue: CjBlue,a chromoprotein from the Cnidopus japonicus sea anemone,naturally exhibits dark green color when expressed.The color isvisibly observed in both LB or on agar plates after 24-48 hours incubating. The sequence is codon optimized for expression in E coli.[4]

RFP:Red fluorescent protein gene was a new fluorescent protein gene isolated from the sea anemone Discoso-masp.The wavelength of maximum absorption is 583 nm, it can be detected without any pretreatment . Red fluorescent protein, which has been widely used in the expression of genes in eukaryocyte cells, such as animals, plants, and yeast, has been widely used in the tissues and penetrating power.
