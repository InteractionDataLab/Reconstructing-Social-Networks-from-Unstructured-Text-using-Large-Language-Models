Overview
An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard biological parts. According this page, you can find a list of all parts that have been registered. Our team in 2015 iGEM plan to send 4 parts. The detailed information can be seen in the registries and our result page.
 
Parts abstract
BBa_K1724000 : The CadA promoter. CadA promoter is a cadmium-sensitive promoter. Its repressor is MerR. In high concentration of cadmium, the Cd2+ can rapidly bind with MerR and remove its inhibition of CadA promoter. The reverse is the opposition.
BBa_K1724001 : Curli, the first identified functional amyloid fibres, are extracellular protein fibers produced by many enteric bacteria including Escherichia coli and Salmonella species . The curli system exhibits numerous features that make it an ideal platform for the type of materials engineering by way of synthetic biology that we envision. First, as the curli nanofibre is composed primarily from the self-assembly of one small protein, it presents a tractable entry point towards creating a large diversity of biofilm extracellular matrices with conventional genetic engineering methods. Second, the functional amyloid fibres formed by CsgA are extremely robust, being able to withstand boiling in detergents and extended incubation in solvents, increasing their potential utility in harsh environments. Finally, recent findings have shown that the curli system can be used to efficiently export natively unfolded polypeptides and can be used in a broad and modular way for the display of various functional peptides throughout the E. coli biofilm. CsgA, the dominant proteinaceous component in E. coli biofilms, is capable of self-polymerizing in vitro into β-sheet-rich amyloid fibers that bind to the amyloid specific dye Congo red (CR), resulting in a red shift and green birefringence under polarized light, and thioflavin T (ThT), leading to increased fluorescence at certain wavelengths.
BBa_K1724002 : The mercury –sensing regulatory protein, MerR(wild type), which regulates mercury resistance operons in Gram-negative bacteria, is subjected to directed evolution in an effect to generate a MerR mutant that responds to Cadmium ion but not mercury.That is, the MerR mutant is the cadmium-sensing regulatory protein. To get MerR mutant, Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis is used to introduce random mutations into the key metal-binding regions of MerR. Finally, Getting the generated Cd-specific MerR mutants appears to be unique.
BBa_K1724003: MntA from lactobacillus plantarum encodes a membrane protein which transports Cd2+ and Mn2+ into the cell ,saturated at around 50 uM ,it is highly specific ,show rapid accumulation ,and can accumulate metal ions effectively in dilute solutions .MntA is a member of the p-type family of adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases). Its transport efficiency is affected by some factors such as other ion of high concentration and temperature.
Comment: We didn't apply it in our project now , it belongs to our future work.
