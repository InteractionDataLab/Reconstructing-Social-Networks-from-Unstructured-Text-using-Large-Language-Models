NO stimulates sGC by combining sGC’s ferroheme(300-700 times). Recent research shows the combining mechanism is involved with two steps: During the first step, NO combines substrate sGC to generate the ferrous nitrosyl heme complexes D3 which then decays to a fully activated state mixture D2. </P><P>The first step of NO combined with sGC can be expressed as a reversible biochemical reaction process:</P><P>D1 and D3 represent the initial and intermediate states of sGC. Accordingly, k and k-1 are rate constants. The second step has two parallel paths which are depend or independ on NO. The two are all involved in the transition from D3 to D2. The process of independent NO was considered to be a natural decay from the state D3 to D2, with the His105 residue separated from the heme. The process can be expressed as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation(rate constant is k2):</P><P>The path which depends on NO can be described as enzymatic action based on the traditional Michaelis Menten kinetics. Since the reversible and dissociation reactions of NO and sGC heme were rapid (association rate constant is 7.1±2*10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 4℃), the damage of His105 residue becomes the rate limiting step in the process (the observed value of rate constant of the process which depends on NO in reference documentation is 2.4*10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUP>-1</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 4℃). Therefore, we assume that the NO dependent pathway can be equivalent to a single step irreversible process with a rate constant k3:</P><P>Another side of NO-sGC reaction’s is NO disaggregates from sGC, which means D2 is inactivated、sGC return to the initial state. We can express the process as a first order and irreversible kinetic equation:</P><P>Rate constant k4 can be regulated by multiple factors, including NO scavenger, substrate concentration and so on. Under the stimulation of cGMP, the yield of NO presents biphase. Along with the initial rapid growth to the peak，following is a recovery to a lower level, with the increase in degradation rate makes the concentration of cGMP reaches to a steady state. Bellamy suggested that the unknown sGC regulatory factors may exist and that the sensitivity of sGC to NO in the late state of cGMP reaction is decreased, and these regulatory factors are active in response to NO's exogenous and endogenous. Now, we assume that the local feedback loop of the final product's cGMP level is a regulator of sGC desensitization. In the hypothesis that cGMP may not be a direct inhibitor of sGC activity, it may be the second messenger that generates negative feedback. We assume that NO separated from sGC and D2 becoming D1 are cGMP mediated processes. In our model, the rate constant of D2 returning to D1 can be expressed as:</P><H2 class="formula">k<SUB>4</SUB>=K<SUB>4</SUB>[cGMP]<SUP>m</SUP></H2><P>K4 is constant. Here, we assume that k4 is mth order of cGMP concentration, where m is the feedback strength of cGMP.</P><P>Summarizing the analysis of sGC kinetics above, we using differential equation to describe the whole process:</P><P>Let D1=[D1]/[D0], D3=[D3]/[D0], D2=[D2]/[D0]. Meanwhile, we assume that the total concentration of sGC is constant, that is to say D1+D3+D2=1. </P><P>We suppose that the NO is immediately consumed when NO is separated from the D2 or leaves the sGC, and generate other substances that make NO no longer free but produce other biochemical components. Thus the result of NO-sGC interaction is that NO have a net loss. The total consumption rate of NO including NO binding sGC can be approximated as a first order kinetic equation:</P><P>Here, Lno is the total amount of NO in cells and in the outside, which represens the available amount NO in physiological or experimental conditions, t is time; Kno express the total consumption rate constant of NO, which reflects the bioactivity of NO.</P></DIV><DIV class="modelingPartContent"><H3 class="modelingPartContentTitie" style="color:#2d90ce">2.2 cGMP's synthesis and degratation</H3><P>Since the synthesis of cGMP is after sGC(D2)'s forming which has catalytic activity, we assume the yield of cGMP generated from GTP mainly depends on the degree of D2’s activity. cGMP's life is determined by PDE5A's multiple subtypes. PDE5A can be hydrolyzed to GMP. The process of production and degradation can be modeled by Michealis equation: </P><P>Supposing that GTP is abundant, the yield of cGMP mainly depend on the concentration of sGC. Studies suggested PDE5A with different substrate affinity、subcellular's position and kinetic properties can catalysis cGMP's hydrolysis. cGMP's balance equation is:</P><H2 class="formula">d[cGMP]/dt = V<SUB>sGC,max</SUB>D2- V<SUB>PDE,max</SUB>[cGMP]/(K<SUB>m,PDE</SUB>+[cGMP])</H2><P>Inside,V<SUB>sGC,max</SUB> represents cGMP's maximum production rate when D2=1, which means all avaliable enzyme molecules participated in catalysis.V<SUB>PDE,max</SUB> is cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation rate.V<SUB>sGC,max</SUB>is directly proportional to sGC's total concentration[D0], and D0 is constant in our model.

Recent studies show, during the process of hydrolyzation the basic level of PDE5A's bioactivation is relatively low. However, after cGMP combining NH2-end structure regulation by itself, this bioactivation is greatly improved(up to 9-11 times). Through cGMP, PDE5A's activated process can be discribed as PDE<SUB>inact</SUB> + cGMP↔ PDE<SUB>act</SUB>. Therefore, active PDE5A's concentration depends on the level of cGMP which because V<SUB>PDE,max</SUB> is directly proportional to active PDE5A's total concentration in Michaelis kinetics. Meanwhile, we suggest that active PDE5A's concentration is nearly proportional to cGMP's concentration. It's a reasonable approximation, if active PDE5A's level is relatively high, cGMP's level is relatively high accordingly. Thus, we consider cGMP's maximum hydrolyzation V<SUB>PDE,max</SUB> is directly proportional to [cGMP]:</P><H2 class="formula">V<SUB>PDE,max</SUB>=k<SUB>PDE</SUB>[cGMP]</H2><H4 class="smallIntroduction">table 1</H4><TABLE class="table table-align-center" style="width:60%;"><THEAD><TR><TH colspan="2">Model Parameters</TH></TR><TR><TH style="width:50%;">Parameter</TH><TH>Value</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>k<SUB>1</SUB></TD><TD>2.0nM<SUP>-1</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>k<SUB>-1</SUB></TD><TD>100s<SUP>-1</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>k<SUB>2</SUB></TD><TD>0.1s<SUP>-1</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>k<SUB>3</SUB></TD><TD>0.003nM<SUP>-1</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>K<SUB>m,PDE</SUB></TD><TD>2.0μM</TD></TR><TR><TD>K<SUB>no</SUB></TD><TD>0.01s<SUP>-1</SUP></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H4 class="smallIntroduction">table 2</H4><TABLE class="table table-align-center" style="width:60%;"><THEAD><TR><TH colspan="4">Model Parameters</TH></TR><TR><TH>m</TH><TH>V<SUB>sGC,max</SUB>,μM</TH><TH>K<SUB>PDE</SUB>,s<SUP>-1</SUP></TH><TH>K<SUB>4</SUB></TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>0</TD><TD>1.26</TD><TD>0.0695</TD><TD>0.4</TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>1.09</TD><TD>0.032</TD><TD>0.98</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>0.8520</TD><TD>0.0195</TD><TD>0.011</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Above is model's parameters from past published documents: these parameters' values are all determined under the condition of NO's amount of substance is 220nH, at this time，D1=1，D2=D3=0，cGMP’s initial concentration is  0，V<SUB>sGC,max</SUB>, K<SUB>PDE</SUB>, K<SUB>4</SUB>is constant.</P></DIV><DIV class="modelingPartContent"><H3 class="modelingPartContentTitie" style="color:#3a86c5">2.3 Innovation analysis of cGMP combined with PKG</H3><P> In our modeling, we assume that, compared with the synthetic rate of cGMP, PKG was activated by cGMP and the target cell phosphorylationis is relatively a fast event. The regulation of cGMP can be evaluated by the normalization function of the concentration of cGMP, A ([cGMP]): when the available amount of cGMP reached the minimum (i.e.: [cGMP]→0, namely: no impact), A→0 ; when the available amount of cGMP reached the maximum (i.e.: the greatest impact), A→1. Therefore, we consider cGMP as a molecular switch of adjusting start and termination of the reaction. We use the Hill Equation to approximate the function:</P><P>K<SUB>m</SUB> and the Hill coefficient(n<SUB>H</SUB>) relatively represent the value when variation tendency of model changes and the step degree of switch. This is only an approximate empirical formula, we can get the precise equation by experiment data. Considering that the reaction rate of cGMP combined with PKG is fast, we assume that the regulation process is reasonable. Therefore, any value of target number Q which is generated by the changes of the amount of cGMP can be generally described by the following algebraic equation:</P><H2 class="formula">Q=Q<SUB>basal</SUB>+A<SUB>cGMP</SUB>(K<SUB>m</SUB>,n<SUB>H</SUB>)Q<SUB>change</SUB></H2><P>Q<SUB>basal</SUB> represents the basic situation of cGMP, Q<SUB>change</SUB>epresents the biggest change of which is induced by cGMP.

As to describe this process by mathematical model language completely and to draw a conclusion which is consistent with the actual situation, we can complete it only to wait until after we improve ourselves.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modelingPart"><H2 class="modelingPartTitle" id="titleC" style="color:#576fb1">3.Results Analysis (sGC desensitization: cGMP local feedback inhibition)</H2><DIV class="modelingPartContent" id="partC"><DIV class="pic_three"><DIV class="figureArea"><H4 class="smallIntroduction">figure.1</H4></DIV><DIV class="figureArea"><H4 class="smallIntroduction">figure.2</H4></DIV><DIV class="figureArea"><H4 class="smallIntroduction">figure.3</H4></DIV></DIV><P>By Figure.1 ,we see that in the linear feedback conditions of cGMP(i.e.: M = 1), different state of sGC changes with the time of change: D1 plummets in a brief period when the reaction started, and then reached a nadir in 8 seconds or so. After a short rising stage it tends to be stable finally; D3, the intermediate product of reactions of NO and sGC experienced a period of increase in the first time and then went to the attenuation and finally reached the stability; D2 (i.e.: high-active sGC) reachs the steady state as the same after a brief surge and small amplitude fluctuations.

The changes of D1, D2, D3, Vp, Vd with time are very simple, either increase or decrease to stabilization, and there is no volume fluctuate with time during the period. However, when the value of the feedback degree of m is 2, great changes have occurred. Fluctuation degree of each volume is more intense compared with all sectors when m=1.

Meanwhile, apart from appearing sharply rising in the beginning and is higher than that with no feedback inhibition, as time goes by, the amount of sGC of feedback inhibition gradually reduces and is lower than that with no feedback inhibition and hold it on. In summary, the function of feedback inhibition of cGMP changes the relationship between cGMP-NO and sGC-NO into a lower state which is consistent with many research results.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modelingPart"><H2 class="modelingPartTitle" id="titleD" style="color:#7a546a">4.Dosage effect of sGC on cGMP</H2><DIV class="modelingPartContent" id="partD"><TABLE class="table"><TBODY><TR><TD>cGMP(nmol/L)</TD><TD>185.5961</TD><TD>189.632</TD><TD>221.0417</TD><TD>287.9465</TD><TD>306.8128</TD></TR><TR><TD>sGC(U/L)</TD><TD>11.78422893</TD><TD>12.51607142</TD><TD>13.93817204</TD><TD>17.98381967</TD><TD>20.11388292</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="pic_one"><DIV class="figureArea"><H4 class="smallIntroduction">figure.10</H4></DIV></DIV><P>In order to study the effect of sGC on cGMP, we need to find out the curve of the experimental group.

Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1,but so far, scientists have not researched the details of the HIV infection, integration, replication and so on clearly, it also means that lentivirus mechanism is not very clear. But the macro and micro mechanism of the exploration of Lentivirus is indeed attracting lots of people interested involved in the study. Here, the iGEM modeling group wants to use some of the existing models to establish the mathematical model to describe the process of the transfection and gene combinations of Lentivirus in the cells.</P></DIV><DIV class="modelingPartContent"><H3 class="modelingPartContentTitie" style="color:#9d3982">5.1 Macro mechanism</H3><P>In order to explore whether Lentivirus has a time delay like HIV in the erosion of the cell, we first make a hypothesis. We assume there is a time delay between the initial Lentivirus invasion susceptible cells and the subsequent infection of the virus. Because the Lentivirus can not produce new virus particles, so when we analyze the whole process,we should avoid the generation of new virus particles. Therefore, according to the research results of Perelson、Bonhoeffer and Xu Rui, we have integrated to establish the model of Lentivirus’s transfection with time delay:</P><P>Among them, healthy cells (also known as susceptible cells) x(t) produce with constant input rate,d represents the death rate, represents saturated infection rate, healthy host cells are exposed to the virus particles after infected with bilinear infection rate of βxv into infected cells y(t);α&gt;0; Infected cells’ death rate is a; The removal rate and initial amount of dissociative virus is μ and k; τ represents the time of virus’ invasion into susceptible cells to susceptible cells infected until death.

From the image above, there are no changes of images with the changes of τ, but always overlap. Thus, we conclude that based on the establishment of Delay Lentiviral Transfection Model, Lentivirus does not have a time delay, which is different with HIV. As to whether Lentivirus completely has no time delay or it has other special properties, further studies need to be done in the future.</P></DIV><DIV class="modelingPartContent"><H3 class="modelingPartContentTitie" style="color:#ab2e78">5.2 Micro mechanism</H3><P>There is no conclusion on the study of Lentivirus, but because Lentivirus is gene therapy vectors which are developed on the basis of HIV-1, so we can simulate the process of cells infected by Lentivirus according to the process of HIV-1 infecting cells and some of the characteristics of Lentivirus. As Lentivirus belongs to RNA virus and the RNA virus’ coat protein contains the reverse transcriptase, the reverse transcriptase of Lentivirus after the invasion of the cells is brought into the cell by the virus itself.

First, considering the production of cGMP can inhibit the reaction system. therefore, we assume that NO seperated from sGC and D2 transforming into D1 are the cGMP mediated process, so we use the feedback factor m to show the degree of the feedback. The question here is whether the degree of feedback will be in accordance with the order we have chosen. Second, there is no conclusion about the research of Lentivirus and the model is only based on the HIV research results of scientific workers. Therefore, in this sense, the model of Lentivirus’ transfection and gene combination in HEK293 cells still exist defects. </P><P>Despite the above limitations, our model can still an extensible framework for the study of the important NO-cGMP signaling mechanisms. Considering the big variety of cells across different tissues and species, NO-cGMP mechanisms are bound to vary and have designs that are specific to cell types. Thus,the model can serve as a general modeling framework for the study of NO-cGMP effects on the HEK293 as a complex cell signaling system. This framework can be tailored to address particular situations and can also be expanded to incorporate newly observed mechanisms.</P><P>In addition, based on scientific workers’ experimental and modeling research of HIV, we have established the model of simulating Lentivirus’ invading cells.
