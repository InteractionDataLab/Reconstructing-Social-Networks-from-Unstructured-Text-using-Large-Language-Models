1. Acquisition of the purpose gene
1.1 Objective gene extraction and PCR amplification
Use the DNA Mini Kit to extract the whole genome of the purpose strain. Please refer to the instruction of the DNA Mini Kit for the details of the procedure.
Precede PCR using the whole genome as the DNA template. The reaction system is as follows:
Table 1
The parameters of reaction condition:
Table 2
Use agarose gel electrophoresis to separate and analyze the PCR product. And then, use DNA Gel Extraction Kit to extract the purpose DNA fragment.
1.2 DNA agarose gel electrophoresis:
1.2.1 Casting a gel
1)Weigh 0.25g agarose in a conical flask. Add 1×TAE 25mL, cover a aluminized paper and dissolve the agarose in a microwave oven for 1~2min taking care not to boil the solution out of the flask.
2)Swirl to mix the gel.
3)Install the gel tray and the comb exactly.
4)Let the agarose solution cool down. Once the solution is touchable, add the DNA stain. Check the stock concentration and add the appropriate amount to give the desired final concentration.
5)Pour the gel solution into the gel tray. Remove any air bubbles with a pipette tip. Put in comb.
6)The gel will solidify while cooling down to room temperature. Remove the comb carefully and place the gel tray into the buffer chamber. Add 1x TBE buffer until the gel is completely covered.
1.2.2 Running the gel:
1)Take part of your DNA samples (~0.2 µg) and mix with loading dye. This can be done either in 1.5 mL tubes or, if the volumes are very small, on a piece of parafilm.
2)Load the size marker mixed in 1x loading dye (~6 µL final volume) into a well.
3)Load your samples into the other wells while writing down which lanes have which samples.
4)Put the lid onto the buffer chamber and connect it to the power supply. Make sure to put it in the right direction so that your DNA runs towards the positive (red) electrode.
5)Run the gel at 120 V for 30–60 min. Neither of the dyes should be run off the gel. If the electrophoresis runs correctly you will notice air bubbles coming from the negative (black) electrode.
6)Stop the run and bring your gel to a UV table to visualize your gel bands and take a picture of your gel. And then cut and extract the gel which contains the purpose DNA fragment. Use protective glasses. If sufficient separation was not achieved, put the gel back into the buffer chamber and run it for longer.
1.2.3 Extract the purpose DNA fragment:
Please refer to the instruction of the DNA Gel Extraction Kit for the details of the procedure, but taking care to cut the gel which just contains all purpose bands as small as possible.

7. Transformation and Selection
Take 200ul competent cell suspension from the -80℃ fridge, unfreeze it in room temperature, and put in on ice at once after unfreezing.
Add pZ plasmid DNA solution (content no more than 50ng, volume no more than 10ul), shake it slightly, and put it on ice for 30min.
After that, heat it in electric-heated thermostatic water bath in 42℃, 90s or 37℃, 5min, then put it on the ice to cool down for 3-5min.
Add 1ml LB liquid medium (without antibiotic), mix it and cultivate it in shaking environment, 37℃ for 1h, which can make the bacteria grow normal again and express the antibiotics resistance gene coded by the plasmids.
Take the mentioned above bacteria solution 100ul after being shaken up and spread it on a plate which includes 3 antibiotics mixed culture, then put it upward for 30min. After the bacteria is absorbed by the medium absolutely, put the petri dish upside down, and cultivate it in 37℃, 16-24h.
Set the control groups:
Group 1:
Use double distilled water to replace the DNA solution, maintain the same operation mentioned above. Under normal circumstances, it's suggested that no colony will appear on the LB plate containing antibiotic.
Group2:
Use double distilled water to replace the DNA solution, and spread 5ul bacteria solution on the LB plate without antibiotic. Under normal circumstances, it's suggested that many colonies will grow on the LB plate.
Test of results:
After the whole night cultivation, some colonies may appear on both of the experimental group and the control group. It's a good omen if the number of the experimental group's colonies is more than the control group's. But whether the colonies are wanted depends on the authenticating of DNA recons.
8. DNA authenticating
Pick up the single colony:
Pick up the single colony from the plate, and inoculate it into 5ml liquid medium containing antibiotic. Then cultivate it for a whole night, 37℃. After that, begin the basic operations to gain the plasmids. Last, use agarose gel electrophoresis (containing 1% agarose gel) to check the results.
9.Agarose gel electrophoresis:
The preparation of 1% agarose gel:
(1)Weigh 0.7g (or 0.5g) agarose and put it into an erlenmeyer, add 70ml (or 50ml) 1×TAE, cover the bottleneck with a small beaker.
Use a microware oven to heat and boil it three times until the agarose melts absolutely, shake it equably. The solution we get is the 1% agarose gel solution. (Normally, the volume of big gel is 70ml, while the small is 50ml)
(2)The preparation of gel plate:
Take the perspex inside groove (the groove which is used to make gel), wash and dry it, then put it on the glass plate used to making gel. Attach the plate to the bottom of the inside groove with tape, which come into a model.
Put the inside groove on horizontal plane, and put a comb in settled position. Cool down the agarose gel to 65℃ and mix it, then pour it into the inside groove, making the gel solution expand slowly, until the homogeneous gel level appear on the whole plate. Keep the gel quiescent until it becomes solid entirely in room temperature, then pull out the comb vertically and take off the tape. Last, put the gel and inside groove together into the electrophoresis tank.
Add 1×TAE electrophoresis buffer until it covers the gel plate.
(3)Adding the samples to the groove:
Mix the DNA samples and buffer solution on a sample plate or parafilm. The dilution multiple of the buffer solution should not be less than 1X. Use 10ul micropipet to add the samples to the holes of the gel plate respectively. When we finish the addition of every sample, we should change the tip to avoid pollution. In addition, we should not destroy the gel level around the holds when adding the samples.
(Notice: Record the sequence of the samples before adding)
(4) Electrophoresis:
After adding the samples, we should electrophorese the gel plate at once. The voltage is 60-100V.
And the samples will move from cathode (Black) to anode (Red). When the voltage rises, the effective segregation of agarose gel will decrease. When bromophenol blue stripes reach the last 1cm of the opposite side of the gel, we stop electrophoresing.
(5)Detection:
After the electrophoresis, take out the gel, and dye it with 1×TAE solution containing 0.5ug/ml ethidium bromide for 20 min, then rinse it with water for 10 min.
Observation and photography: Observe the gel under ultraviolet lamp, there will be red fluorescent strips if DNA existed, then use gene genius bioimaging system to take photos and save.
