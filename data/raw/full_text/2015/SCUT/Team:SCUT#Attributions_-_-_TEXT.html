MntA transport
Yu Zhong and Xiaojun Cai were responsible for the combination of constitutive promoter added in front of the MntA protein with the double terminator behind. After that, they just tested the parameters of the relationship of the concentration of cadmium out and in the E.coli. They spent all their summer holiday finishing it.
Cadmium adsorption
Ruiming Xiao, Xiaojing Li and Jionghui Li managed CsgA transport part. Ruiming Xiao and Xiaojing Li was in charge of the construction of PcadA +CsgA-EC(n)+TetR+RFP+ter. Jionghui Li also made efforts to assist both of them. Ruiming Xiao made brilliant contributions and devoted himself to testing the MerR/CadA operon using red fluorescent protein and he also helped Li to measure the AU of the RFP. As for Xiaojing Li, she was diligent and she made great efforts to construct different number of EC protein in order to find the best one. Also, because of deleting the wild CsgA will help efficiently express EC, So Minghui Deng and Yulong Zhang were responsible for the CsgA deletion.
Sensor system
Xiaomei Lin and Xunxun Luo buried themselves in this part. They just made the device such as Ptet+cjblue+ter. And also, Xiaomei Lin had finished the measurement work with the help of Xiaojing Li. In addition, combining with the device of CsgA transport system, Li and Lin successfully tested the fluorescent protein and checked if the system worked.
Design work
Yihong Gu, Shuoyu Chen, Jiahui Zhang and Yunan Lin had undertaken all the tasks of designing of the whole team. They did a lot work including logo, ppt templates, wiki and uniforms. Taking step by step, as a result of clarified division and efficient cooperation, they sophisticatedly design uniforms and posters for the IGEM. And Manfredi helped modify the wiki content.
Modeling Part
Junying Su is responsible for final determination of mathematical model for our project. He devotes to modeling the function of our engineering E.coli accurately. In addition, he writes Parameters Measuring and Data Processing Schemes for four parts, including MntA Transport Model, PcadA Strength Model, csgA Polymerization Model and csgA-ECn Adsorption Model. He also assists the members of experiment group to finish measuring work.
Xiaobin Huang is responsible for studying the mechanism of MntA transport. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has also studied the mechanism of sodium potassium pump and calcium pump, which are also the members of the P-type family of adenosine
triphosphatases (ATPases). At the same time, he devotes to establishing the model of Ptet Strength. He has found out two available models in the previous iGEM work of Team EPF-Lausanne 2008 and Team UC Davis 2013 respectively. [1][2] Additionally, he works in data processing.
Chongyin Han is responsible for studying the mechanism of csgA polymerization. In order to find out a suitable mathematical model, he has studied an available model in the work of Team INSA-Lyon 2014. [3] Whether this model is useful for us, we need further verification.
Nana Pang is responsible for studying the mechanism of PcadA and merR mutant, and devotes to establishing the model of PcadA Strength. In order to figure out the accurate concentration of cadmium ion at which PcadA takes obvious effect, she analyzes the combination process of cadmium ion and merR.
Jing Liao is responsible for studying the mechanism of csgA-ECn adsorption. She devotes to working out the value of disassociation constant Kd with the available data. In addition, she tries to figure out the optimal value of csgA-ECn length n to improve the ability of cadmium ion adsorption.
