Meet up in SYSU
On July 19th, 2015, we spent a meaningful afternoon at the Sun Yat-sen University with other four IGEM teams. They were SKLBC-China, SKLBC-GDSYZX,SYSU-software and SCUT-China . We had fully exchanged the designs and thoughts of projects, which has greatly promoted the mutual understanding and let us know more about ourselves in the same time.
 
The meet up was divided into three parts. Part one was ICE BREAKER. Everyone present was supposed to use three key words or phrases to introduce yourself in one minute. Part two was time for PROJECT PRESENTATION .Each team has ten minutes to demonstrate and explain its projects，while members of other teams could write down their own questions and comments in a piece of paper which lastly would be hanged over to the corresponding teams. The last part was called WORLD CAFÉ.All people were divided into three groups.All groups will discuss a same topic—What is the relationship between experimental teams and software teams，in the way you like (eg：pictures, thumbnails, branching tree, etc.) and furtherly,leading to the contact between wetlab and drylab.
 
Here, wehighly appreciate it that Team SKLBC organized this meet up forwardly to provide an opportunity for communication and learning，and wefeel really honored to be invited. Through communications with other teams, we recognized our own problems and got a great help in their suggestions.Such an activity is really meaningful to exchange experimental experience and toImprove overall experimental operation ability.
