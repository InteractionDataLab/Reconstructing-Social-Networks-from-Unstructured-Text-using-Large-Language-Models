Cellular concentrations of cGMP were examined using a commercial Elisa Kit. As shown below, cellular concentration of cGMP increased after SNP treatment and peaked at 20 minutes. We used this condition as a positive control in our later experiments.</P><P class="smallIntroduction">Fig.1  cGMP concentration after treated with 10umol/L SNP </P></DIV><DIV class="part" id="partB"><H3 style="color:#00b4ed">2.sGC Overexpression</H3><H2 style="color:#00b4ed">Construction: </H2><P>Lentivirus vectors carrying the α or β subunits of sGC were created using the scarless golden gate assembly.

After discussion, we thought there may be several issues in the model, i.e. slower growth of cells or weaker activity of EGFP under the hypoxia condition. Thus, we also measured expression of EGFP by real-time PCR. That data further proved that the HRE device worked as we expected, although not as strict. We believe we can improve this promotor and make it more sensitive in our future work.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
