For the sake of spreading knowledge of synthetic biologyso that more people could learn about it，we have invited a number of high school students, most of which were high school freshman, to visit our laboratory. We answered the questions they have raised to us and then led them to dosome easy experiments.
Firstly, we gave them a small introduction of synthetic biology. We showed them that biologists had been trying to use gene sequence information and artificial synthesis of DNAto modify the metabolic pathway of cells so as to make cells with new functions, such as the production of chemicals and drugs. Their ultimate goal was to try to build a gene from scratch, as well as a new life style. The students were very amazed aboutthis new concept and felt it a miraculous movethat cells could be directional transformed as human thoughts.
Then we led them to do the 3A assembly experiment. At the beginning, they were so nervous and cautious that the bacterial genome was also extractedin the process of plasmid extraction because of the longtime of celllysis step. However，they were performingbetter and better. </P><P style="text-align:center;">

We usually only know that the gene can be reorganized “in book”, but do not know how and the principle about it. In this study, I can feel that I am a little closer to the ‘biology’.

Tang：Because we are just high school students, the commonlearning was only the knowledge in the textbooks. This time，we can really feel the charm of biology. We can not only learn this subject better, but also cultivate our interests in the biologic research in the future.

Kwan: I have never knew that biology could be likethis. Synthetic biology is so cool. If people can really transform the micro-organisms oriented and help them play their roles, or reasonably turn their harmful sides orshortcomings intogood things, it will change the life todaygreatly.

Huang：It was my first time to walk into a biology lab. I kept telling myself to be careful.How interesting the microscopic world is!

Hall:  I was not even very clear about every step in what to do, but this is really an interesting experience. I feel like I'm walking towards a field that is unknown to me. And I really enjoy it.

We learned a lot from each other in this activity. High school students got to know what  molecular biology and biochemistry experiments are . As the old saying goes, reviewing the old and you can know the new , we reviewed the previous knowledge at the same time. 
We ourselves also have an in-depth understanding and awareness of synthetic biology. The most valuable thing is that we have obtained their sincere love for iGEM andsynthetic biology. We want them to be lovers of biology. In the future, maybe they can  make great contributions for the  research and development of biology，which would make us very proud of today’s work.</P><P style="text-align:center;">
