Requirements for a Bronze Medal
We have registered the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
We have successfully completed and submited this iGEM 2015 Judging form.
We have created and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have planned to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have create a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.  See https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT/Attributions
We have documented new standard BioBrick Parts central to our project and submited these parts to the iGEM Registry. BBa_K1724001 , BBa_K1724003
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal and Gold Medal
We have experimentally validated that four BioBrick Parts of our own design and construction works as expected. We also characterize those parts in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part. BBa_K1724000 , BBa_K1724002
We have submitted these new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry. BBa_K1724000 , BBa_K1724002
We have created the Human practice on our wiki and our project may have implications for the ethics, education and economy and/or ownership and sharing. https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT/Practices
We have integrated the investigated issues into the design about our project. https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT/Practices
We have helped FAFU-CHINA with their modeling. https://2015.igem.org/Team:FAFU-CHINA/Modeling
We have improved the characterization of BBa_M36247 and entered this information in the part's page on the Registry.
