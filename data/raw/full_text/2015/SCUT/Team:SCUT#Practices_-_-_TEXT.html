Practices
This year, we have completed a total of six human practices， trying to improve and evaluate our projects from multiple aspects.
 
Two of them were held based on our project.
（1） Visit Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences ： Industrial automation is one of its Main research direction，and it always has been developing new technology of environmental pollution detection .So we decided to visit this institution for professional advice. They showed us their current research and also studied our project. We communicated together and evaluated the progressiveness of our project, and found out the shortcomings.
 
（2） Visit Guangzhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau   
It is a governmental detection center. In the visit，we learned about the current detection methods，and discussed about the application prospect of our products. Moreover, they called our attention to the importance of safety and recycling when using microorganism in the environment.
The other four are based on the social investigation and education.
（1）   Interview with Professor of Economics   
We analyzed the social impact and economic benefits of our project from the perspective of social economy.
（2）   Education about synthetic biology.  
We invited some high school students to visit our lab. We introduced them some basic knowledge of synthetic biology，and led them to do a set of 3A assembly experiment.
（3）   Meet up     
We participated in a meet up in which five teams were invited to communicate projects with the other teams. We introduced our projects and got questions and suggestions form the others. What’s more? we have talked about an interesting topic that how to use web tools to optimize project designs，and we got many funny ideas.
（4）   Social questionnaire    您是不是要找: social questionable 我们发布了一项大众对重金属镉离子的认识程度调查
We released a questionnaire about how much do the public know about cadmium element. We can see from the result that many people have realized the existence of cadmium in articles for daily use. But they don’t have convenient methods to detect it in time. You can read a specific report on the block of Social questionnaire.
