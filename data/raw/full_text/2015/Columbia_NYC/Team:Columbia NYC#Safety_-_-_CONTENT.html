As a result, we ensured that we took steps to keep ourselves safe and out of harm's way by taking the following steps: </P><H2><B> Safe Project Design </B></H2><P> In order to reduce the risks that our team members were exposed to while working on the project, certain decisions about the project design were made. </P><UL><LI><B> Choice of Chassis</B>: The chassis organisms we worked with are all BSL-1 organisms and fall within Risk Group 1 by NIH guidelines. The specific chassis used are: <I> Escherichia coli </I> MegaX, Nissle, and K12 and <I> Lactobacillus reuteri </I> and <I>casei </I>. As such, team members were not exposed to potentially harmful bacteria. </LI><LI><B> Choice of Parts</B>: The genetic parts we were working with were are, by the nature of our project, safe for humans. The signal peptides we are working with can be found naturally in <I> E. coli </I>and <I> Lactobacillus </I> and are not shown to impact human health and the gut peptides GLP-1, PYY, and Ghrelin are already naturally found in humans. In addition, the lysis mechanism involves the use of holins and endolysins that are not harmful to humans. </LI><LI><B> &quot;Kill Switch&quot; Device</B>: In addition to the secretion of gut peptides, the design of our device includes a &quot;kill switch&quot; device that will cause cells to undergo a delayed cell-death after the secretion of gut peptides. This system is regulated by AHL-based quorum sensing. For more information, please visit our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Columbia_NYC/Design"> project design page</A>. </LI></UL><H2><B> Safe Lab Work </B></H2><P> In order to ensure the safety of all of our team members, proper training had to be provided and safe lab procedures to be carried out on a daily basis. The following are steps taken to meet this goal: </P><UL><LI><B> Safety Training </B> : All team members completed the training and received certificates for &quot;Lab Safety, Chemical Hygiene, and Waste Management&quot;, &quot;Recombinant DNA Training&quot;, and &quot;Biological/Bloodborne Pathogen Training&quot; that is given by Columbia University. As such, team members are trained to work in a laboratory setting and handle potential emergencies before starting experiments. </LI><LI><B> Proper Lab Attire (PPE)</B>: In order to decrease potential exposures to biological materials and chemical reagents, team members are required to wear closed-toe shoes, long pants, and gloves while at the bench. In addition, goggles were used when necessary (i.e during exposures to higher frequency light). </LI><LI><B> Using Safe Substitutes</B>: To further decrease the number of potential risks in the laboratory, we used lab procedures that had the least inherent risks. Most notably, this involved the use of SYBR Gold E-Gel over agarose gels that need to be stained by the carcinogenic ethidium bromide. </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
