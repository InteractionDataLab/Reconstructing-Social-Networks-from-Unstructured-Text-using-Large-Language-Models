Introduction
Behind every project is a series of inspirations and sparks of imaginations that pave the road forward and sets the wheels turning. However, it would be unfair to say that our project was the result of the thoughts of a singular mind. Instead, our project is the culmination of a multitude of ideas that interacted and mingled into a shared goal. As a result, the task of answering the question of “Where did it all begin?” is not a simple one, so we ask the reader to bear with us as we take you through the series of thoughts that landed us at the starting point of our journey.
