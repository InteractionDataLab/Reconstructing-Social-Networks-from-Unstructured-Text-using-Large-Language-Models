We held two information exchange meetings this year.
iGEM ANU
On June 21st, the first exchange meeting was held at our home, University of Tokyo. We both gave a presentation of this year's project each other and exchange our views against synthetic biology.             Thanks for visiting from Australia!
IONIS iGEM
On July 19th, second meeting was held on the Internet. Since this was the first time for us to have a meeting with teams from Europe, it was totally new challenge for us.             By introducing each projects, we’ve got to know the difference of management system, environment and so many cultural things. We also made a video of our project.

iGEM JAPAN
As a leader of that commnity, we gathered 5 Japanese teams and did presentation at May Fest together. We also provided opportunity for meet up.             iGEM JAPAN has one more important work; hub for supports from firms. Reagent and DNA construct are included.
