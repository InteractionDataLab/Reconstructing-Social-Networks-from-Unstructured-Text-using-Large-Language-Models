Quantitative Analysis Tool for Fluorescence Microscopy
We have developed a tool to analyze fluorescence individually for each bacterial cell, based on ImageJ and MATLAB. The tool takes a LIF microscopy image as an input and outputs the 2D data analysis (Biological, Individual) or 3D data analysis (Technical, Biological, Individual).

Downloads
Software repository
Our software is available on the iGEM GitHub software repository!
The following files are required for this tutorial:
MATLAB post processing script: post_processing.m .
ImageJ macro: Interlab.ijm .
Sample TIFF file: NTNU_Trondheim_Tutorial_Sample.tiff .
Preparing the data set files
The microscope software (LAS AF, Leica) provides the data set in a LIF format. This file has about 1 GB size. While ImageJ can read LIF format, it does not manage the memory very well, and cannot upload the images simultaneously. One method to circumvent this issue is to convert the LIF file into many TIFF files. Each TIFF file contains one fluorescence image and one bright field image. Download the bfconvert utility to convert the Leica LIF files into a set of TIFF files. The utility is available from http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.1.3/ .
Run in a terminal
./bfconvert 150818\ Interlab\ Hyd2.lif %n.tiff
The following output will appear confirming the conversion of the images.

The resulting files have spaces in their name. This creates problems for ImageJ. The spaces can be converted into underscores with the following command:
$ for file in *.tiff; do mv "$file" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done
Now the images are in a file format that can be easily handled with ImageJ.

Running the batch processing script
The script is named Interlab.ijm , and requires Fiji, which can be downloaded from http://fiji.sc/Downloads
After starting up Fiji, the script can be run by dragging it and dropping to the main window as shown below.
Then, clicking "Run" as shown below:
A window will appear to invite the user to select the folder where the TIFF files are located as shown below:
A new window appears to invite the user to select the directory where the processing is exported as shown below:
At this point, the script will run automatically, processing all the files in the specified directories without user input. Every TIFF file is composed of one brightfield image as shown here:
As well as a fluorescence image as follows:
The script proceeds in segmenting the images into individual bacteria as illustrated here:
The script can also be used as a bacteria cell counter.
Finally, the results are displayed and saved into a CSV file, as shown below:
Post-processing
The final CSV files are post-processed in MATLAB using post_processing.m . As an outcome of this tutorial, the InterLab Study has been submitted using quantitative analysis, and compares satisfactorily with the results obtained by flow cytometry, which can be seen in the Interlab page.
