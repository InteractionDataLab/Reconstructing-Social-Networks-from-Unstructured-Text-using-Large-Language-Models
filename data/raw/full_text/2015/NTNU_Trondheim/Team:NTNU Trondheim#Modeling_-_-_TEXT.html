Glucose-mCherry response
Brixells modeling
This page contains mathematical equations using MathML. Most browsers support it (Safari, Firefox, etc.) but Chrome and IE do not. If you are using Chrome or IE, please consider viewing this page in an alternative browser.
The pathway triggering the expression of mCherry upon reception of Glucose is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Biological molecules involved in the P. Putida signaling pathway for expressing mCherry.
Using the generalized mass action equations and the pathway shown in the figure above, we can write the kinetics of the systems in the following form, the results are shown in Figure 2:

Brixells
The Brixells Modeling Tool, has been created to assist Team Warwick to predict the probability of bonding of 3D structures built with E. Coli expressing Zinc fingers and DNA strands. More details are available on the collaborations page.
Conclusion
Modeling can be very useful to optimize the design of P. Putida as it is very sensitive to glucose toxicity. This framework can help in optimizing the lifetime of the glucose-sensing capsule and should be considered in the alginate formulation. This model is to be combined with a population level glucose toxicity model for agent-based modeling in BSim.
