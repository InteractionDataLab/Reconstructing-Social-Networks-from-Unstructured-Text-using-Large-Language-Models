Software repository
Our software is available on the iGEM GitHub software repository!
Three computational tools have been developed in the course of the summer:
Quantitative image analysis tool for high throughput processing of confocal microscopy images.
iGEM Matchmaker , updated from the one originally developed by the NTNU 2012 team with automatic team matching using keyword extraction.
Brixells Modeling Tool , created to assist Team Warwick to predict the probability of bonding of 3D structures built with E. Coli expressing Zinc fingers and DNA strands.
