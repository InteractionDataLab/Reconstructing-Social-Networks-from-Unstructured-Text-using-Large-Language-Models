Bronze.
Your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 6 goals:
Registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and attended the Giant Jamboree.
Completed the Judging form .
Created and shared a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and documented the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Presented a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree according to 2015 poster guidelines
Created a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines ). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
Silver: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
Experimentally validated that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
Participated in the Measurement Interlab Study . Submit measurement data to the committee by the study deadline (see iGEM 2015 calendar of events for details).
Demonstrated how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
Gold:
Expanded on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique or a previous iGEM team measurement project.
