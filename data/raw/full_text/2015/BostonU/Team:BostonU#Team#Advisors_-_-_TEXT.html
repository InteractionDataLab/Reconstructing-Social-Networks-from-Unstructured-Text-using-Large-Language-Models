Divya
Divya is a 3rd year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering department at Boston University. She conducts research in Dr. Mo Khalil’s laboratory studying properties of protein aggregation in mammalian cells, and is interested in applying synthetic biology to study complex genetic diseases. Divya is originally from California and completed her Bachelor’s degree in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley in 2013. She is an iGEM alumnus herself, having participated as a student on the 2012 MIT iGEM team. Outside of lab, Divya helps run the BU Graduate Women in Science and Engineering chapter and a science club for girls at a local after-school program. She enjoys mentoring students, reading, and traveling.
Ben
Ben is a 4th year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering department at Boston University. He conducts research in Dr. Wilson Wong’s laboratory building novel genetic tools for logic and cellular computation in mammalian cells. Ben is originally from Connecticut and completed his Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University in 2012. This is his first year being involved with iGEM! Outside of lab, Ben enjoys reading, traveling, and tending to his community garden.
