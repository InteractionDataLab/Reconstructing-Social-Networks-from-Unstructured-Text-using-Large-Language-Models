Prashanth Vishwanath, Bioinformatics Manager at Monsanto, visited the team to learn about our research project, and discuss synthetic biology in industry, specifically at Monsanto. He spoke with us about the companyâ€™s mission and the type of work that was being conducted at the Cambridge site. We got to ask questions and learn more about how the company fit in the wider synthetic biology industry. We also got to talk to him about our project idea, and learn more about how conditional dimerization of proteins might have industrial applications.
Later in the summer, we got an opportunity to tour the Monsanto Cambridge facilities. We heard a presentation from a Monsanto researcher who talked more about how new new products are developed at Monsanto and all the work that goes into bringing a product to market. We also got to give a quick pitch of our project to other Monsanto members, which was a great experience in communicating our project without any visual aids. We got to walk through labs and see all of the equipment that researchers there use - and much of it looked very similar to our own lab at BU.
Thanks to Monsanto for sponsorship and for the site visit! We really appreciate it.
