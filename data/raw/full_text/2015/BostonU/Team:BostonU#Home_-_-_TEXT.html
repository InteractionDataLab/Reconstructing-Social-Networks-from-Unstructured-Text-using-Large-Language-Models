Welcome to Our Project !
The goal of our team this summer is to create an efficient and widely applicable workflow for splitting proteins. By splitting proteins and fusing each half to a drug-inducible domain, scientists can gain temporal control over protein expression. Using our workflow, the proteins will be translated into two inert halves that are each fused to domains that bind in the presence of an inducer drug. By introducing the drug into the system, the two inert protein halves will come together and for a fully functioning protein. In this way, scientists can further increase their control over protein function. The two types of proteins we will be testing our workflow on are the large serine integrase family and saCAS9. These proteins harness powerful mechanisms that have significant applications in the future of synthetic biology. By using our workflow, we hope to increase scientists understanding of these proteins and also provide a mechanism for increasing temporal control.
