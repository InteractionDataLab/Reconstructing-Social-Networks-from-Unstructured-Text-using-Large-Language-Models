Mammalian Protocols
To transfect our sets of plasmids into mammalian cells and assay for fluorescence using flow cytometry, we used the following protocols in our experimental pipeline.
We expanded a new line of HEK293FT mammalian cells from Divya Israni’s frozen cell stocks.
We passaged our cells every 3-4 days to keep them alive, healthy, and viable for experimentation.
We counted cells in order to prepare a certain concentration for plating.
We plated our cells in 48-well tissue culture plates to grow our cells overnight in order for them to be optimal for transfections.
We used an Epoch kit to Miniprep purified DNA plasmids for transfection.
We prepared a mixture of plasmid DNA for transfection by diluting the DNA plasmids to equal concentrations and mixing them together.
We used PEI-mediated transient transfection to get our plasmid DNA mixtures into the plated HEK293T mammalian cells.
We let our transfection cell plates incubate overnight and an additional day.
We transferred cells into 96-well plates ready for flow cytometry analysis.
We finally performed flow cytometry using a BD Fortessa Flow Cytometer.
Mammalian Cell Culturing
Expanding a Cell Line from Frozen Stock
Obtain a frozen stock of HEK293FT cells (ours came from our Mentor Divya Israni)
Warm cell stock in 37 C bath
Plate 0.5 mLs liquid cell stock
Add 10 mLs media
Incubate overnight
Cell line is now ready, begin to passage and plate as necessary
Splitting Protocols
Basic Idea
We need to keep the cells alive and well, so every 3 days you need to “passage” them into a new flask of a 1:10 dilution with new media and such. This is ONLY to keep them alive for later use such as plating and transfecting. Always make sure to work in a specific tissue culture room and to sterilize everything before entering the hood. This is to in general not contaminate the cells.
Materials
Flask with previous passage cells (or initial cell line if first passage) [referred to as flask 1]
New empty flask [referred to as flask 2]
DPBS (buffer to wash away excess media)
DMEM (media for cells to utilize) w/ 25 mL bovine serum, 5 mL streptomyacin, 5 mL L-glutamine, 5 mL sodium something
Trypsin (enzyme to lift cells from bottom of flask)
Steps
Ready waste container with bleach, put anything that touched cells into this
Cells will be adhered to bottom of flask 1 containing media in 37 C, CO2 regulated incubator
Flask should be vented (slightly open) when in incubator
Under microscope cells should look like clouds and take up 70% of the space (this means they are 70% confluent)
Tilt flask 1 so that media is away from bottom (with adhered cells) and remove media using seralogical pipette into the bleached waste bucket
Pipette 4-5 mLs of DPBS into corner of flask 1 away from adhered cells
This is to make sure that no cells are dislodged, which would occur if the reagent was pipetted directly onto the cells
Rock flask back and forth to get media off of cells
Make sure not to get any media in the neck of the tube
Pipette 2.5 mLs of Trypsin into corner of flask 1 away from adhered cells (same motion as DPBS)
Rock back and forth to get trypsin on cells
Vent flask 1 and place in incubator for about 5 minutes (no more than 15 mins) for Trypsin to take effect
Label flask 2 with Cell line, Passage number (first time will be “P0”, second “P1” etc), dilution (concentration of cells to media), initials, and today’s date
FOR A 1:10 DILUTION (good for keeping alive, passaging every 3-4 days)
Add 9 mLs of media to flask 2
Make sure not to splash into neck and that all media is spread across the bottom of flask 2
Look at flask 1 under microscope, should see cells moving in clumps
Add 7.5 mLs of media to flask 1 (to bring total volume of flask 1 to 10 mL as we had already added 2.5 mLs of Trypsin)
Tilt the flask and pipette up and down and across the bottom of the flask to wash the cells into the media (about 15 times)
Try for no bubbles
This will also break clumps, important for single cells to be passaged as they will get proper amount of media and grow better
Put 1 mL of media+cells (for 1:10 dilution) from flask 1 into flask 2 that already has media
Gently rock flask 2 forward and backward then back and forth, making sure not to get anything in neck
Look at flask 2 under the microscope to make sure there are not too many clumps, if so continue to pipette mixture up and down
Vent the flask and place in the incubator anytime the cells are not being worked on in the hood
Your cells are passaged 1:10 and good for 3-4 days!
FY1: If using for plates next day, passage 1:2 (5 mLs cells, 5 mLs media)
Counting Cells Protocol
You will need to count your cells before plating them, even before transfecting them.
Want 50,000 cells/mL for density when plating
Use 1 PCR per flask of cells
If making many plates, mix all flasks together beforehand and ensure single cells only, then do following steps
Aliquot some media using 1 mL pipette from flask 2 into the microtube
Add 10 microliters trypan blue and 10 microliters cells+media to a PCR tube and let them sit for a minute - this stains the cells so they can be counted
Take the half moon sheet for the Countess machine and add 10 microliters of the stain solution into the indented half moon
OR simply pipette onto glass slide and count under microscope, want to finally know cells/mL
Insert into Countess and make sure clean so that there is no fuzziness or it will be counted as dead cells
Want at least 90% of cells to be live
Good number is over 1x10^6
Plating Cells Protocol
Get sterile, tissue cultured 48 well plate
Going to put 250 microliters into each well so total necessary media is 12.5 mLs (round up to 15 for safety)
Math: (50,000 cells/mL)(15 mL) = (live cells/mL from Countess)(X mL) and solve for X
Pipette X mLs of media into reservoir and pipette 15-X mLs of media also into the reservoir
Make sure to mix thoroughly and frequently as to ensure only single cells are plated
Eppendorf large Multichannel settings:(at least 1000 ul multichannel pipette)
Dispense
250 microliters
Speed 4-5
4 times drop
tip x x tip x x tip x x tip x x
Look at plate under microscope to make sure that all wells look about the same and that it looks like 50,000 cells/mL
Gently tap plate on all four sides against wall to make sure cells spread out
Incubate at 37 C, CO2 regulated
Transfection Protocol
DNA Mixture
Have spreadsheet made in advance about which plasmid goes into which tube
8 strip PCR tube holds all of DNA + NACL + PEI
Each PCR tube holds enough for 8 wells = 200 microliters
will only be using enough for 6 wells = 150 microliters to run positive and negatives in triplicate
which is 25 microliters/well
Each tube should get 4 plasmids of 50 ng/ul
This can be adjusted depending on how many plasmids need to transfected, important number is that each well gets 250-300 ng/ul DNA
If tube only needs less than 4 plasmids must use blank plasmid (ps-21)
for example: full integrase control has transfection marker, reporter, full integrase and blank plasmid
for example: dark cell control has blank plasmid, blank plasmid, blank plasmid, blank plasmid
All DNA should be diluted to 50 ng/microliter in advance
Or less if using more plasmids
Add 10 microliters of each 50 ng/microliter plasmid to tube for 4 plasmids total = 2000 ng DNA total
Should have 40 microliters of DNA in each tube
GO TO TC HOOD
Add 60 microliters .15 M NaCl to dilute DNA and bring total volume to 100 microliters
Mix NaCl + PEI to be 42:8 for all tubes
Each tube gets 50 microliters of this mixture, add extra wells to ensure enough
Mix thoroughly in reservoir
Add 100 ul NaCl + PEI to each tube
Mix thoroughly!! PEI is what mediates transfection
Let sit for 15-20 mins
Use large yellow integra pipette (at least 125 ul multichannel pipette)
aspirate 75 microliters
will dispense 25 microliters three different times (into three rows of the negative 48 well plate)
Same protocol for positive plate
Incubate overnight
Incubate all of next day
Transferring from 48 to 96 Well Plate
Tilt plate so that media is aggregated, aspirate 250 microliters (all) of media from 48 well plate using large eppendorf multichannel pipette
Add 50 ul of trypsin to each well (so for 48 well plate need at least 2.5 mL of trypsin in reservoir)
MAKE SURE to move plate north to south and east to west and tip back and forth to make sure that trypsin gets ALL cells off of bottom of plate
Incubate for a 10 mins and make sure to look under the microscope - should see single spheres that move if you tip the plate
DO NOT want cells to come off in sheets, will mean too many cells and likely poor transfection
Add 50 microliters of media to each well (again at least 2.5 mL of media in reservoir)
Use yellow integra multichannel pipette
Mix many times
Aspirate 100 ul and transfer to 96 well plate
Flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy
Cleaning Up
Pipette bleach into anything with old passages of cells in it (will kill them)
Pipette that into waste container already containing bleach (let sit for about 10 mins) then wash down drain while running water
Flask shut tightly and reservoir, both thoroughly cleaned into biohazardous waste
Wipe down inside of hood with ethanol
Close hood and leave UV light on for 15 mins to sterilize
General Tips
70% ethanol on ANYTHING entering hood, especially gloves
Do not push window above the sash level (dictates how much air gets in)
Try to keep things in the hood and not take too much stuff in there
Always keep incubator at 37 C and 5% CO2
Media colors: pink = oxygenated; red = grown; orange - yellow = overgrown
Confluence = how close together the cells are; want 70% when passaging or plating
HEK203T cells are adhesive so do not move flask too much
When in the hood do not pass anything over (eg hand) open containers of cells
Labelling new flask for passage: (Lab name) (Cell line)
(passage #) (day of the week) (dilution)
(date) (initials)
