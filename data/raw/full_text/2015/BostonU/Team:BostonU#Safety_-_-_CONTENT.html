Before entering the lab environment, each member of the team was required to complete a safety training course hosted by the school. In that class we learned everything we needed to make sure that we and those around us stayed safe. We learned procedures for handling dangerous materials, what protective wear is necessary, as well as all necessary steps for ensuring a safe lab. Additionally, a requirement of the iGEM competition is each team must complete a lab safety form to ensure that all team members are being safe in the lab. The topics we learned about in our lab safety training class are posted below..</P><H3 style="padding: 5px; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">Lab Safety Form</H3><H4>General Biosafety Principles</H4><P>Discussed terms, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), safety equipment, containment, and an overview of the biosafety levels.</P><H4>General Laboratory Biosafety Principles</H4><P>Discussed general laboratory guidelines, pipetting techniques, blocking routes of exposure, laboratory and personal hygiene, biological hazard information, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual.</P><H4>The Biosafety Levels</H4><P>Discussed the requirements for each level.

What are the guidelines for laboratory biosafety? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.</H4><P>Our advisors, Divya Israni and Ben Weinberg, are the lab safety coordinators for our lab. Boston University Environmental Health and Safety (BU EHS) is responsible for the safety of biology labs at our institution, led by Gloria Waters.
The biosafety manual provided by the Laboratory Safety Committee division of the EHS details the guidelines for laboratory biosafety: http://www.bu.edu/orc/files/2014/08/BU-Biosafety-Manual_2014.pdf
These guidelines identify the proper behavior, policies, and precautions for every kind laboratory procedure and equipment.</P><H4>In your country / region, what are the laws and regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.</H4><P>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a full biosafety manual: http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf
This manual defines the principles and practices of biosafety and risk assessment for research laboratories in the United States.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><P>Copyright Boston Unversity IGEM Â© 2015  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
