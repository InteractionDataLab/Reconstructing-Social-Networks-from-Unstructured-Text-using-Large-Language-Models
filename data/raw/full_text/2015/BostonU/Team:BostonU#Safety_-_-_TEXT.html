Safety
We take safety very seriously at Boston University. Before entering the lab environment, each member of the team was required to complete a safety training course hosted by the school. In that class we learned everything we needed to make sure that we and those around us stayed safe. We learned procedures for handling dangerous materials, what protective wear is necessary, as well as all necessary steps for ensuring a safe lab. Additionally, a requirement of the iGEM competition is each team must complete a lab safety form to ensure that all team members are being safe in the lab. The topics we learned about in our lab safety training class are posted below..
Lab Safety Form
General Biosafety Principles
Discussed terms, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), safety equipment, containment, and an overview of the biosafety levels.
General Laboratory Biosafety Principles
Discussed general laboratory guidelines, pipetting techniques, blocking routes of exposure, laboratory and personal hygiene, biological hazard information, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual.
The Biosafety Levels
Discussed the requirements for each level. We focused on procedures for BSL1 and BSL2.
Biohazardous and Medical Waste Disposal
Discussed when and where to dispose of laboratory waste - sharps container and biohazard bin
Laboratory Equipment and Usage
Discussed utilization of lab equipment (centrifuges, biological safety hoods, autoclaves, etc.)
Biohazardous Spill Response and Emergency Procedures
Discussed what to do when there is a spill, if there is a fire, proper use of the emergency shower and fire extinguisher
Decontamination and Sterilization
Discussed the importance of proper lab attire, maintain a clean lab environment, and handling disinfectants
Procedures for Working with Animals
Discussed proper protocols when working with animals
Laboratory Door Signage
Discussed the meanings of all the symbols on the sign
Handling and Transport of Biological Materials
Discussed how to properly manage and transport biological materials
Boston Public Health Commission Requirements
Discussed local mandates, procedures within Boston University institution
Guidelines for Working with Chemicals
Discussed importance of MSDS and SDS sheets, general procedures for working with chemicals
Laboratory and Equipment Decontamination Procedures
Discussed decontamination of lab equipment and lab space
Who is responsible for the safety of biology labs at your institution? What are the guidelines for laboratory biosafety? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
Our advisors, Divya Israni and Ben Weinberg, are the lab safety coordinators for our lab. Boston University Environmental Health and Safety (BU EHS) is responsible for the safety of biology labs at our institution, led by Gloria Waters. The biosafety manual provided by the Laboratory Safety Committee division of the EHS details the guidelines for laboratory biosafety: http://www.bu.edu/orc/files/2014/08/BU-Biosafety-Manual_2014.pdf These guidelines identify the proper behavior, policies, and precautions for every kind laboratory procedure and equipment.
In your country / region, what are the laws and regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a full biosafety manual: http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL.pdf This manual defines the principles and practices of biosafety and risk assessment for research laboratories in the United States.
