She conducts research in Dr. Mo Khalil’s laboratory studying properties of protein aggregation in mammalian cells, and is interested in applying synthetic biology to study complex genetic diseases. Divya is originally from California and completed her Bachelor’s degree in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley in 2013. She is an iGEM alumnus herself, having participated as a student on the 2012 MIT iGEM team. Outside of lab, Divya helps run the BU Graduate Women in Science and Engineering chapter and a science club for girls at a local after-school program. She enjoys mentoring students, reading, and traveling.</P></TD></TR><TR style="padding-bottom:60px;"><TD><H2>Ben</H2><P>Ben is a 4th year PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering department at Boston University. He conducts research in Dr. Wilson Wong’s laboratory building novel genetic tools for logic and cellular computation in mammalian cells. Ben is originally from Connecticut and completed his Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering at Boston University in 2012. This is his first year being involved with iGEM! Outside of lab, Ben enjoys reading, traveling, and tending to his community garden.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2>Wilson Wong</H2><P>Wilson Wong is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. He is the recipient of the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award and the BU Engineering Dean’s Catalyst Award. He was an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. Wendell Lim at UCSF in cellular and molecular pharmacology. He completed his PhD at UCLA with Dr. James Liao. Wilson is interested in applying metabolic engineering and immune cell engineering to rapidly and predictably engineer desired properties in human immune cells to treat diseases.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2>Mo Khalil</H2><P>Mo Khalil is the Innovation Career Development Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. He is the Associate Director and a Founding Core Member of the Biological Design Center, and is also a Visiting Scholar at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. He was an HHMI Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. Jim Collins at BU working in systems &amp; synthetic biology. He completed his PhD at MIT with Drs. Angie Belcher and Matt Lang in molecular biophysics &amp; engineering. Mo is fundamentally interested in developing synthetic genetically-encoded molecular networks to study how cellular systems behave and evolve in diverse environments.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
