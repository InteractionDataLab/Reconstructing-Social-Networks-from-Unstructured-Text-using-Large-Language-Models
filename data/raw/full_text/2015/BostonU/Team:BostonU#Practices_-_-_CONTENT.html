It involves teams reaching out to the public and increasing the general public's awareness and knowledge of synthetic biology. The BU team has been actively looking for ways to fulfill the human practices aspect of the iGEM competition. </P><H3>Building with Biology</H3><P>The Museum of Science developed a prototype synthetic biology exhibit designed to increase public awareness of the field and dispel unwarranted concerns. There were multiple stations set up at the exhibit where the public could play games that were designed to stimulate an open discussion between themselves and synthetic biologists. In this manner, the scientists were able to demonstrate to people exactly how useful and safe synthetic biology can be. The exhibit premiered at the MOS and five other museums across the country as a test to determine how effective an exhibit of this nature would be and was also used as a trial to make adjustments to each module of the exhibit. Every member of the BU team volunteered at the exhibit and was able to engage the public in interesting and productive conversation. We were also able to provide useful feedback to the members of the museum staff who designed the exhibit.

</P><H3>Upward Bound Nanotechnology Lab</H3><P>The Boston University iGEM team hosted an event for high school students that was designed to demonstrate the uses of synthetic biology. We hoped to increase interest in the field, which is an important way that we can help build the field and bring new minds to synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><P>Copyright Boston Unversity IGEM Â© 2015  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
