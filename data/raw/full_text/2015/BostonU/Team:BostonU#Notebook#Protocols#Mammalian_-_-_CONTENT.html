This is ONLY to keep them alive for later use such as plating and transfecting. Always make sure to work in a specific tissue culture room and to sterilize everything before entering the hood. This is to in general not contaminate the cells.</DD><DT>Materials</DT><OL><LI> Flask with previous passage cells (or initial cell line if first passage) [referred to as flask 1]</LI><LI> New empty flask [referred to as flask 2]</LI><LI> DPBS (buffer to wash away excess media)</LI><LI> DMEM (media for cells to utilize) w/ 25 mL bovine serum, 5 mL streptomyacin, 5 mL L-glutamine, 5 mL sodium something</LI><LI> Trypsin (enzyme to lift cells from bottom of flask)</LI></OL><DL><DT>Steps</DT><OL><LI>Ready waste container with bleach, put anything that touched cells into this</LI><LI>Cells will be adhered to bottom of flask 1 containing media in 37 C, CO2 regulated incubator</LI><LI>Flask should be vented (slightly open) when in incubator</LI><LI>Under microscope cells should look like clouds and take up 70% of the space (this means they are 70% confluent)</LI><LI>Tilt flask 1 so that media is away from bottom (with adhered cells) and remove media using seralogical pipette into the bleached waste bucket</LI><LI>Pipette 4-5 mLs of DPBS into corner of flask 1 away from adhered cells</LI><LI>This is to make sure that no cells are dislodged, which would occur if the reagent was pipetted directly onto the cells</LI><LI>Rock flask back and forth to get media off of cells</LI><LI>Make sure not to get any media in the neck of the tube</LI><LI>Pipette 2.5 mLs of Trypsin into corner of flask 1 away from adhered cells (same motion as DPBS)</LI><LI>Rock back and forth to get trypsin on cells</LI><LI>Vent flask 1 and place in incubator for about 5 minutes (no more than 15 mins) for Trypsin to take effect</LI><LI>Label flask 2 with Cell line, Passage number (first time will be “P0”, second “P1” etc), dilution (concentration of cells to media), initials, and today’s date</LI><LI>FOR A 1:10 DILUTION (good for keeping alive, passaging every 3-4 days)</LI><LI>Add 9 mLs of media to flask 2</LI><LI>Make sure not to splash into neck and that all media is spread across the bottom of flask 2</LI><LI>Look at flask 1 under microscope, should see cells moving in clumps</LI><LI>Add 7.5 mLs of media to flask 1 (to bring total volume of flask 1 to 10 mL as we had already added 2.5 mLs of Trypsin)</LI><LI>Tilt the flask and pipette up and down and across the bottom of the flask to wash the cells into the media (about 15 times)</LI><LI>Try for no bubbles</LI><LI>This will also break clumps, important for single cells to be passaged as they will get proper amount of media and grow better</LI><LI>Put 1 mL of media+cells (for 1:10 dilution) from flask 1 into flask 2 that already has media</LI><LI>Gently rock flask 2 forward and backward then back and forth, making sure not to get anything in neck</LI><LI>Look at flask 2 under the microscope to make sure there are not too many clumps, if so continue to pipette mixture up and down</LI><LI>Vent the flask and place in the incubator anytime the cells are not being worked on in the hood</LI><LI>Your cells are passaged 1:10 and good for 3-4 days!</LI><LI>FY1: If using for plates next day, passage 1:2 (5 mLs cells, 5 mLs media)</LI></OL><DL><DT>Counting Cells Protocol</DT><OL><LI>You will need to count your cells before plating them, even before transfecting them.</LI><LI>Want 50,000 cells/mL for density when plating</LI><LI>Use 1 PCR per flask of cells</LI><LI>If making many plates, mix all flasks together beforehand and ensure single cells only, then do following steps</LI><LI>Aliquot some media using 1 mL pipette from flask 2 into the microtube</LI><LI>Add 10 microliters trypan blue and 10 microliters cells+media to a PCR tube and let them sit for a minute -
