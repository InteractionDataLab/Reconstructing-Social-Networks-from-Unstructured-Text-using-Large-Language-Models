John Viola
John Viola is a rising senior studying biomedical engineering, and is originally from New Jersey. John enjoys doing research in synthetic biology, because it allows him to combine everything he’s learned in different areas of science to explore and engineer complex systems. After graduation, John’s goal is to work in Research and Development, especially in a position that combines analytics with developing new medical technologies and treatments. In his free time, John enjoys catching the latest movies at the theatre, taking in a sports game, or trying out a new restaurant.
Jeff Chen
Jeffrey Chen is a rising senior studying biomedical engineering. He was born and raised in New York City and came to Boston University looking to combine his passions for engineering, biology, and software. Outside of the lab, he enjoys playing basketball, soccer, and tennis. His ultimate goal in life is to help develop cures for diseases and hopes to someday work for the CDC.
Shaheer Ahmed Piracha
Shaheer is the youngest member of this team. He is a rising Junior studying Biomedical Engineering.Shaheer has been extensively involved in a diverse array of research projects ranging from bio-optic diagnostic tools to clinical research at BMC and is eager to experiment in the field of synthetic biology. Shaheer loves to swim,golf,hike, play squash and has an acute passion for English and Urdu poetry. You can see his smiling face ,a mile away, and he is always ready for a quick chat.
Kate Ryan
Kate Ryan is a junior studying Biomedical Engineering.  She loves studying biology and doing research and in her free time enjoys running, reading and cooking.  Kate plans to work for a Biotech company in R+D.  She’s interested in synthetic biology because it combines her two favorite things: engineering and biology.
Nick Salvador
Nick will be entering his senior year as a biomedical engineering major this Fall. He's from Philadelphia, PA and enjoys reading, fishing, and hanging out with his dog. His goal for the future is to make prosthetics like Luke Skywalker's hand a reality. He is interested in the field of synthetic biology because of the astounding applications it could have in the future and hopes to be able to continue to contribute to the field after the iGEM competition is over.
Abha Patil
Abha Patil is a rising senior studying Biomedical engineering. When she is not in the lab she enjoys exploring different parts of Boston, bowling and spending time with friends. Abha hopes to create efficient, innovative, and low cost medical technologies to bring better healthcare to all parts of the world in the (hopefully) near future. She loves taking part in iGEM because she is learning so many techniques and ideas in a really cutting edge field.
