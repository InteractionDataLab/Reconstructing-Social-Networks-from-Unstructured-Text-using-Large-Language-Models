Achievements
• Assembled and integrated two different safety switches, based on TPK2 overexpression or mRFP expression induced at low ATP levels, into CEN.PK2.
• SS TPK2 shows reduced growth rate after OD-measurement but no change in viability compared to wild type.
• mRFP measurements show that connection of pTEF1 to pSUC2 maintains the glucose repression mechanism of pSUC2, while achieving higher expression at low glucose concentrations.
• Successfully constructed and integrated the system to detect the P-factor from S.pombe into CEN.PK2.
• Contaminant detection by the detection system
• Amplified all parts of the repair system, but obtained vector-only clones after Gibson and transformation into E.coli
