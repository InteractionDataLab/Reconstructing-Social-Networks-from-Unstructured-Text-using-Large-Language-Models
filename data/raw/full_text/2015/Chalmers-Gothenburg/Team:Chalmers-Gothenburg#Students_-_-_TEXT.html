Students
Johanna Asserlind
Age 22, Master's in Biotechnology 1st year.
Johanna is now doing her last year of Master in Biotechnology, with specialization in tissue engineering. Science and technology have always been great interests of Johanna, especially living beings as well as experimenting with chemicals (with mixed results). In her spare time, Johanna likes to practice martial arts and yoga, read fiction novels and play music, mostly cello and drums.
Alexander Branzell
Age 22, Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering 1st year
Alexander brings a lot of knowledge about programming. He is the one who builds up and edits our wiki.
Christoffer Bäckberg
Age 22, Bachelors in Biotechnology 3rd year.
Christoffer has finished his bachelor in biotechnology and is now continuing on the same track at master’s level. Except from a great interest in science, Christoffer has a competitive mind and is impossible to beat in anything regarding sports and games, including our team building activities. If you are looking for a movie reference, Christoffer is the guy you’re looking for.
David Dagson
Age 26, Engineering physics, 3rd year.
David has a background in physical engineering and has recently started a master's in physics and astronomy. On his spare time, David enjoys theatre, music and philosophy.
Gustaf Edman
Age 22, Bachelors in Biotechnology 3rd year.
Gustaf is a really competitive person. Competitions bring him both joy and motivation. This fall Gustaf has started his master’s program in biotechnology, with specialization in Biomedicine and Biotechnology. At the age of 16, Gustaf performed his first genetic modification by inserting a GFP-gene in E. coli, but the interest in biotechnology didn’t really flourish until he participated in iGEM 2014. Outside the lab Gustaf enjoys experimenting with cooking and brewing.
Johanna Tingvall Gustafsson
Age 21, Bachelors in Biotechnology 1st year
Johanna has always been interested in biology. At age 7 the dream was to become a scientist studying ladybugs, instead she ended up studying biotechnology. She is the youngest team member and is still studying at bachelor’s level. Except from biotechnology, music and training are great interest of Johanna. She previously practiced gymnastics for many years but have now started to play rugby instead.
David Hammer
Age 22, Bachelors in Biotechnology 3rd year
David grew up on the west coast of Sweden and turned to the city of Gothenburg for higher education. In his spare time he likes to play different sports, especially badminton, and also to play the guitar.
David Hansson
Age 22, Bachelors in Biotechnology 3rd year
With a background in Biotechnology, David has now chosen to continue with a Master in Complex adaptive systems. David grew up outside Gothenburg but has recently moved into the city.
John Hellgren
Age 24, Bachelors in Biotechnology 3rd year
John was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, but for some inexplicable reason he ended up in Gothenburg. He has recently started his first year of Master in Biotechnology. On his spare time he loves exercising, especially running, and play fetch with his maine coon cat, Mimmi.
Georgia Nakos
Age 24, Bachelors in Chemical Engineering 3rd year
Georgia grew up in a small town located on the beautiful west coast of Sweden. Working out, painting, traveling and playing the piano are a few things she takes pleasure in outside of the classroom. Whenever she has free time, she picks up a good book to read and enjoys spending time with family and friends.
Yvette Palm
Age 26, Master in Biotechnology
Yvette is studying the last year of her Master in Biotechnology. She is deeply involved in the theatrical stage, and enjoys acting as well as being in the audience. When she has time you can find Yvette on the countryside, fishing, gathering mushrooms or simple enjoying the serenity.
Angelo Salazar
Age 24, Master in Biotechnology 1st year
Angelo is studying the second year of Master in Biotechnology with specialization in biomaterials and tissue engineering. He’s been engaged in a student organization called Society for Biological Engineering which has the aim of spreading knowledge to other students about science and biotechnology. His other interests are practicing capoeira and traveling to visit family and friends. Angelo is also a real dog lover!
Sandra Ferreyra Vega
Age 26, Master in Biotechnology 1st year
Sandra is currently a second year Master student in Biotechnology, following the track of Tissue Engineering. Once she graduate she would like to start a PhD and deepen her knowledge in the regeneration of human tissues.
Gabriella Wåssén
Age 25, Chemical engineering 3rd year.
Gabriella has a background in chemical engineering and is now taking her Master in Biotechnology. She really enjoys being in nature and has been a scout since the age of 8. Gabriella likes to engage in the different organizations of the student union and travel far and wide whenever opportunity is given. You are likely to find Gabriella at fine dinner parties wearing long evening dresses.
