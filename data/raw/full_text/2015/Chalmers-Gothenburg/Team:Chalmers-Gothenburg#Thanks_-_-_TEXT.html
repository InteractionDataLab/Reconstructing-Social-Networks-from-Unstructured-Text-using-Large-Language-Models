Thanks
We have spent many hours working in the lab, on human practices and many other tasks, but we would never have managed to finish the project without the help from a lot of people. Some have helped us by advising and guiding us in the lab, others have helped by sponsoring our project. We would like to sincerely thank everyone who have helped us with our work.
