BioBricks
1. BBa_K1603000 : STE2MAM2
Fusion GPCR of the non-cytoplasmic N-terminal signal peptide from STE2 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Pheromone P-factor receptor MAM2 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) without its signaling peptide. Allows in vivo detection of the Pheromone P-factor from S.pombe through the Pheromone pathway in S.cerevisiae.
2. BBa_K1603001 : pTEF1-pSUC2
The high expression pTEF1 promoter connected to pSUC2 promoter. Allows induced high expression of downstream gene at low ATP levels.
3. BBa_K1603002 : pTPI1
Promoter to TPI1.
4. BBa_K1603003 : RecA
Recombinase A from Deinococcus radiodurans. Used in DNA-repair mechanisms.  Codon optimized for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fused with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for in vivo DNA repair. Also fused with a His-tag, allowing nickel based purification prior in vitro DNA repair.
5. BBa_K1603004 : SSB
Single strand binding protein from Deinococcus radiodurans. Codon optimized for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fused with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for in vivo DNA repair. Also fused with a His-tag, allowing nickel based purification prior in vitro DNA repair.
