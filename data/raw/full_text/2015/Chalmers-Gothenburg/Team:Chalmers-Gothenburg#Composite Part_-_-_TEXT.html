Composite Parts
Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Composite Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Composite parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic parts assembled together. BBa_I13507 is an example of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red fluorescent protein, and a terminator.
New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
