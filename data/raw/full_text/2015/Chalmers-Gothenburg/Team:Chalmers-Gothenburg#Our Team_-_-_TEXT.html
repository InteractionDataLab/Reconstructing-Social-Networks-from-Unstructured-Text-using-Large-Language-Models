Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg/Our Team
Our Team
We are Team Chalmers-Gothenburg, a group of students with different backgrounds but a common interest in Synthetic biology. Chalmers University is a well-known technical university in Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden located on the beautiful but rainy west coast.
The team is composed of 15 students with backgrounds in several different fields, including Biotechnology, Chemistry, Physics and Computational Science. This broad range of knowledge has given us the possibility to face challenges with different perspectives. Therefore teamwork and cooperation are of great importance for our team and every person in the team is crucial for a successful result.
To integrate the different parts of the project and to avoid miscommunication, we have deliberately chosen not to divide into groups with specific tasks. Instead most of the team members have been involved in both lab work and human practices. However, the lab work has been divided into three main groups focusing on each of our three systems. No matter how much we enjoy working in our lab, we have also arranged team building activities outside the lab almost every week which has made the summer even more fun.
