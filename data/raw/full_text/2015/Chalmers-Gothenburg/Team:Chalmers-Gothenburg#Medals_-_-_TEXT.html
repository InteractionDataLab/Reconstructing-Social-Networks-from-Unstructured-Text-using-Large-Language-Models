Medal requirements
Bronze
We have registered an iGEM team, had an awesome summer in the lab, and we will attend the Jamboree.
We have completed the judging form.
We have uploaded a description of our project on this wiki-page and registered our BioBricks SSB , pTPI , RecA , STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 by using Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
You can come and visit us by our nice poster at the Jamboree and come and hear our presentation on the 25th.
We have a page on the wiki where all the attributions are listed.
We have documented the following new parts that have been used in our project: SSB , pTPI1 , RecA , STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 .
Silver
We have characterized two of our registered BioBricks: STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 .
STE2MAM2 and pTEF1-pSUC2 have both been registered in the iGEM Part Registry.
We believe that the Human Practices are really important. We have therefore done work concerning both safety and ethics as well as various outreach efforts in different areas. You can read all about it on the pages Safety and Human Practices.
Gold
We have done something extra special and new for our Human Practices. We recognize the importance of everyone being able to find information about scientific topics which are explained in a simplified way. We have therefore translated and extended articles on Wikipedia which is a very important source of information.
We have during the entire summer collaborated with the team Czech Republic . Itâ€™s their first year participating in iGEM so we have been helping them with some startups as well as where to find important information and the free DNA starting kit. We have also shared some of our Human Practices and modeling work with them.
We have improved the function of RecA by codon optimization for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fused with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for in vivo DNA repair. Also fused with a His-tag, allowing nickel based purification prior in vitro DNA repair.We have also improved the already existing Biobrick pSUC2 with our two fused promotors pTEF1-pSUC2 : the part is still regulated the same way, but has a higher expression level when induced.
pTEF1-pSUC2 also improves the function of pTEF1 by adding repression at high levels of ATP and induction at low levels of ATP.
