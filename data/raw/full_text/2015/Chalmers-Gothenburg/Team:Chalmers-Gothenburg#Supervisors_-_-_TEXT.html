Supervisors
Verena Siewers
PhD
Verena is the main supervisor for the team and has been living in Gothenburg for 7 years but is originally from Germany. She has been the supervisor for the Gothenburg team since 2012. When she is not at Chalmers she tries her best to ignore the Facebook page that the team so kindly created for her earlier this year!
David Jullesson
"You are always a minion to someone"
PhD-student
David has been a supervisor for the Gothenburg team for the past 2 years and before that he was a member of the team from Link√∂ping, Sweden. He is a great and constant support in the lab and gets to help us with all of our problems. We also want to congratulate him on getting married this summer!
