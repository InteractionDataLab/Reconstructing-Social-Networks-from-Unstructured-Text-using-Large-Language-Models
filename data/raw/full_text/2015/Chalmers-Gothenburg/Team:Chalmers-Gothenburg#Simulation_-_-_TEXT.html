This simulation was made by team Czech Republic via our collaboration. Based on the parameters we obtained when modeling the detection and amplification of signal system, team Czech Republic created a physical simulation representing yeast cells exposed to a contamination. The contamination occurs at random locations in the sample of cells and the intensity of the amplified signal are based on the aforementioned model parameters.
