Support from Chalmers University of Technology
We would like to extend our thanks to our University who have supplied us with funds, facilities and resources to be able to conduct this project. We would also like to thank the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering for letting us use their laboratory and equipment, and also for showing us great kindness and patience throughout the entire summer.
Support from our Supervisors
All the work on this project has been done by the student members of this team unless stated otherwise, areas of work include planning, research, implementation, human practices and funding. However, without the guidance and persistence of our supervisors, this project would never have been possible. Thus, we want to give our greatest thanks to Verena Siewers and David Jullesson who helped us with advice and directions in every aspect of the project. Their knowledge and experience in the field of synthetic biology has been invaluable and their never ending patience never ceased to inspire us.
Additional support from University personnel
We want to thank and acknowledge the people at the Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology for showing us great support and care, every day, giving us a second home for the summer. We want to give special thanks to Marie Nordqvist and Ximena Rozo Seville for always aiding us when working in the laboratory, spending time showing us how to operate machines and how to function in the laboratory. Additional acknowledgements are given to Eugene Fletcher, Michel Gossing, Raphael Ferreira and Lei Shi for their help with troubleshooting and providing invaluable advice when we needed it the most.
Assistance from outside the University
The team wants to thank Per Sunnerhage at Gothenburg University for providing us with the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. Furthermore, we want to thank and acknowledge the assistance from the iGEM team Czech Republic for their help with simulations and graphs as well as their aid with the collection of survey results. Additionally, we want to express our deep graditude to Yiannis Stilos for creating and designing our amazing iGEM team logo.
