Modeling
For the modelling of this project we have been working with sets of ordinary differential equations. Important key reactions that take place for each system were mapped and a system of equations were set up to describe the systems. We have been using Matlab and the built in function ODE15s to solve the equations, providing us with theoretical data on how the system behaves.
