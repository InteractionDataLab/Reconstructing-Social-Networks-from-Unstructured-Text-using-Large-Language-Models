The weak signal can be explained by the fact that constructs containing the amplification system through dCas9-vp64 could not be completed. This forces the detection system to rely on the weak promoter pFUS1 <B>[1]</B> to express mRFP. This can result in a weak fluorescent signal when the P-factor is detected.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="DNA_Repair_System">DNA Repair System</SPAN></H2><P>The PUR genes were successfully amplified through PCR, see figure 8, but only clones with empty vectors were obtained after Gibson assembly and transformation into E.coli.</P><P><B>Figure 8. 1kb ladder, RecJ, RecA, RecQ, RecD2, SSB, PprA and 1kb ladder.</B></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Safety_switch">Safety switch</SPAN></H2><P>All three variants of the safety switch (pTEF1-pSUC2-TPK2, pTEF1-pSUC2-mRFP and pSUC2-mRFP) was successfully integrated into the genome of S.cerevisiae CEN.PK2 and verified by colony PCR and sequencing.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="SS_TPK2">SS TPK2</SPAN></H3><P>The results for continuous OD-measurement of the wild type S.cerevisiae CEN.PK2 (WT) and CEN.PK2 with integrated safety switch (SS) in YPD are shown in figure 8.</P><P><B>Figure 8. Growth curve of Wild type CEN.PK2 (WT) and recombinant CEN.PK2 with the safety switch (SS).</B></P><P>The measurements indicates that both WT and SS grow initially at the same rate but after ~6 hours, as energy (glucose) levels starts to decline, SS continues to grow at a reduced rate. This is not ideally as the safety switch is supposed to kill the cells, instead of just reduce its growth rate.</P><P>To check if the reduced growth rate was caused by reduced viability of the cells, a drop test was performed after 48 h cultivation in YPD. 10 µL of serially diluted cell suspension was spotted on an YPD plate and incubated overnight. The OD-measurement after 48 hours cultivation is shown in figure 9 and the drop test in figure 10.</P><P><B>Figure 9. OD600 after 48 hours cultivation. Figure 10.

A solution for this insufficient safety switch could be to change the TPK2 to a more harmful gene.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="SS_mRFP">SS mRFP</SPAN></H3><P>Expression of <I>mRFP</I> (monomeric Red Fluorescent Protein) was used to analyze expression levels of the safety switch. To evaluate the effect of connecting pTEF1 to pSUC, two different versions were made: pTEF1-pSUC2-mRFP and pSUC2-mRFP. Both constructs were integrated into the genome of S.cerevisiae CEN.PK2. The fluorescence of the clone with integrated pTEF1-pSUC2-<I>mRFP</I> (TEFSUC) and the clone with pSUC2-<I>mRFP</I> (SUC) was compared with wild type CEN.PK2 (WT).</P><P>The first sample of TEFSUC, SUC and WT was cultivated for 2 hours in YPD. The results from fluorescent microscopy are shown in figure 11-14.</P><P><B>Figure 11. Positive control. Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP).

Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP). Right: RFP channel.</B></P><P>3 hours of cultivation in YPD (after overnight preculture) gives no visible RFP fluorescence. A reason for this could be that 2 hours is not enough to give a significant drop in energy levels to relieve the repression of pSUC2.</P><P>A new sample of TEFSUC, SUC and WT was cultivated for 6 hours in YPD. The results from fluorescent microscopy are shown in figure 15-18.</P><P><B>Figure 15. Positive control. Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP). Right: RFP channel.</B></P><P><B>Figure 16. TEFSUC sample 2 cultivated for 6 hours. Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP). Right: RFP channel.</B></P><P><B>Figure 17.

Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP). Right: RFP channel.</B></P><P>Now there is a clear difference between TEFSUC and SUC. TEFSUC gives several highly fluorescent cells while SUC only shows slightly higher fluorescent compared to WT. This indicates that the repression of pSUC2 is reduced which allows expression of mRFP through the high expression promoter pTEF1. </P><P>Another fluorescence measurement was performed on the same sample after 23 hours of cultivation. 
The results from fluorescent microscopy are shown in figure 19-22.</P><P><B>Figure 19. Positive control. Left: overlay channels (bright field, RFP and GFP).
