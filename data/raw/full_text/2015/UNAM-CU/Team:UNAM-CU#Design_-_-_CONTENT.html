</P><P>Treatment implementation is accomplished through a modular mechanism designing mathematical models from the interstitial fluid and simulated loads act on the device by applying the method of finite element analysis (FEA) for its acronym in English. The modular mechanism consists of three main modules, was governed under the objectives of increasing the quality of life of patients to be more autonomous, simple and easy to use, the lower parts and electronics to reduce costs and the main thing is to provide an effective containment of the bacteria inside the human body allowing them to make an adequate level of glucose sensing and simultaneously provide safety for the user to be biocompatible with the body.

</P><P>Broadly speaking the device comprises: containment module which is the backbone of the device column to contain the bacteria within the human body, specifically in the area where the interstitial fluid is. It is a biocompatible porous polymer with the human body in pill form which allows the passage through its pores interstitial fluid as insulin, is confined to keeping bacteria.

</P><P>The next module will call communication, by connecting the container with a hose of a biocompatible polymer and whose dimensions are of the order of millimeters, with the dermis in which there is a gate with a diameter of 6.5mm that is a mechanism iris (similar to the lens cameras), which are two notches on the outside that serve as key to connect to the extraction module being open and avoiding contact with the outside and thereby reducing potential infections, as you can find a similarity between this module and a catheter, which we realized they have problems in this area and so we designed this &quot;cap&quot; or totally mechanical gate allowing greater aseptic to make the change of bacteria.

</P><P>Finally the extraction module and change of bacteria, which in short can say is a kind of mechanical &quot;syringe&quot;, automatic and which consists of two buttons (one for withdrawal and one for injection) that control a single electric motor 25X12x10 mm dimensions which drives a mechanism with two spur gears that turn the eccentric shaft circular transnational movement, similar to a Scotch yoke mechanism, reducing control by electronic and thus decreasing costs.

</P><P>I deeply regret that my investigation should be downloadable , but the file size is very heavy.
