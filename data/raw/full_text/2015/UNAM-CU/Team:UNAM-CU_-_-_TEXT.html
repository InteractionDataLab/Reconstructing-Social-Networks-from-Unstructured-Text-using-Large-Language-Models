Welcome to IGEM-CU page
Our project:
Can you imagine a device containing a bacterium, to detect glucose throughout the day and in response to it expulse insulin? Imagine the possibilities this could have if implemented, by means of a device such as treatment in type 1 diabetes and some cases of type 2 diabetes?
IGEM-CU is doing everything possible so that the answers to these questions come true!
Why?
Because:
In 2014 the global prevalence of diabetes * was estimated to be 9% among adults aged 18+ years.
In 2012, an estimated 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes
More than 80% of diabetes deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries
And we want to make it better
How?
Because:
By bringing together a group of students of medicine, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and biomedicine.
Taking advantage of individual skills and abilities make them within a team
Using tools of molecular biology
Creating an organism that can measure glucose in the medium, in response to it, synthesize insulin and subsequently to eject means.
Designing a device that is functional, economical and safety for all users
Creating a mathematical model which explains each variable involved in the experiment
And finally, designate a doctor to monitor them all and ensure that the experiment is safe and functional!
If you have interested, be prepared to read the interesting trip UNAM students had to do to make a project that could help many people around the world
