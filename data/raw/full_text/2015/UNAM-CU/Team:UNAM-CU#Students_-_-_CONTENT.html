Alejandro got interested in the Undergraduate Biology program because of the complexity and beauty of life, coupled with that “it is the career where he could find the integration of all what he likes”; he would like to develop biotechnology and to take his startup to the future. 
</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Lizbeth Airais Bolaños Castro  </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Lizbeth is a Basic Biomedical Research student at the UNAM and she coordinates the wetlab work of the team. She was responsible for the collaboration with the UNAH and worked on wetlab. 
Liz has always been interested in knowing and understanding different organisms and to different levels, and that’s the reason why she looked for the ones who generate all that knowledge, and when she knew who they were, she decided to become a researcher. In the future, she would like to carry research projects with multidisciplinary teams, to form students and to enhance more people to question their environment.

</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Alfredo Antonio Lopez Castillo  </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Alfredo is a Biology student at the UNAM, he worked on the modeling part and simulating the system on the computers.
He got interested in this Undergraduate Program inspired by the degree of complexity of all living beings that is such that you never end learning when you study them”. In the future, Alfredo would like to dedicate to research.

</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Ilia Xrysw Hernandez Mejia  </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Xrysw, is  the head of the Human Practices area of the project and student career of Chemical pharmaceutichal and biology of the UNAM, career that she joined because she was always very curious and loved reading about science. She worked on the science workshops with AIESEC, wetlab and designing the biobrick.
 In the future, Xrysw wants to engage in genomic medicine, or pharmacogenomics studies on the prevention of genetic diseases or linked to genes, as some cases of predisposition to cancer, as she has always liked being able to help people.


</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Carlos Andres  Gil Gomez   </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Andrés studies the Undergraduate program in Biology at the UNAM because of his passion for animal life; in the future he would like to do research in biomathematics.
Andrés is head of the mathematic modeling team within the project due to his great interest in mathematics he worked on most of the pen and paper part of the model modifying the equations and making them work. 

</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Diego Fernando   Galavíz López    </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Diego is the head of the engineering area of the project and he studies Mechanical Engineering at he UNAM because of his passion to understand the operation of things, to create and improve devices, and to try to control the causes and effects of physical phenomena. Because scientists study the world as it is and engineers create the world that has never existed. In the future, Diego would like to work into aerospace or automotive industry. He designed and make the simulations of the case of Proinsulitron so it can worked on human conditions, the mechanism of extraction as well as the iris. He worked closely to the medical part of the team. 

</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Frida Fernanda Reyes Arroyo     </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>Frida Reyes, Frida is a student of the Physician Undergraduate program at the UNAM and in the future she would like to get involved into basic research and medical clinic diagnosis. She worked on the medical part making sense of the ideas and working with engineering so the device has all the medical considerations in it. 
</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Cesar Adrian  Garcia Carreon    </B></CENTER></H4><P><I>César Adrián, is fourth-year student at the Center for Genomic Sciences at UNAM. As his inspiration for studying was &quot; A children summer science work group where he met the wonderful world of DNA” In a future he would like to work in the Genetic Engineering Applied area. He worked designing the biobricks and the bioinformatics part of the project as well on providing some help to the modeling team. 
</I></P><H4><CENTER><B> Alejandro Rodriguez Gama    </B></CENTER></H4><P><I> Alejandro is a Basic Biomedical Research student at the UNAM,he along with Alejandro Guzman design  the original idea behind the project, he worked on the biobricks as well as in wetlab doing the characterizations of them.
