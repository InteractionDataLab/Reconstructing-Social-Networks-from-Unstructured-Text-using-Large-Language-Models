He is our super advisor of the team. He provided us with firmly technical support about our experiment design. It is he who always couraged and helped us to overcome most of obstacles we've met in project. Without his professional knowledge and highly experimental skills about iPS, the experiments we did in mouse iPS and human iPS would be nothing but impossible. He made our idea more clear and beautiful.
