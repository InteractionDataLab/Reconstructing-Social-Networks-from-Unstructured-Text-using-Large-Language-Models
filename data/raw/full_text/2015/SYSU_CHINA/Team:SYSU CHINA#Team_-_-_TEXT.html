Dengwen Lai
My name is Dengwen Lai, the captain of SYSU_CHINA. This is the second time for me to attend the competition and I hope I can fully enjoy it.
Chunyang Ni
Designer of Microtimer 3.0 & Rule the conscrution of Microtimer 2.0 and Microtimer 3.0.
Jianheng Liu
This man has participated in iGEM for two years.This man likes something interesting like synthetic biology and RNA editing.
Yuchen Lu
In charge of the model part, specialized in applied mathematics, computer, data mining & process. Hope to study something new and interesting from iGEM and this precious experience.
Qianbin Zhang
Participate in construction of Microtimer 2.0 and Microtimer 3.0. A reliable assistant of molecular cloning.
Yexin Yang
She is the designer of Microtimer 2.0, majored in Biotechnology. Her main research interest is the cellular signaling pathway of immunity and its related diseases. Besides immunology she likes soccer, and is a huge fans of FC Barcelona and Arsenal.
Zhan Shi
A lively young girl who wants to see the world with her own eyes. She was in charge of human practice and participated in designing bacteria timer.
Qiang He
He is the designer of the Team Prokaryote and also constructes the huge plasmid containing many parts to make it work. This is his second year to take part in iGEM, and his precious experience helps us a lot.
Xuan Xie
Participate in the testing work of Micro-timer, majored in biotechnology. An enthusiast of  stargazing and birdwatching.
Ruihao Li
A senior biotechnology major student from Sun Yat-sen  University. He is one of the designers of Prokaryotic Timer  and  mainly participated in the experiments of testing  group.
Pai Li
Hi, I am Pai Li, a senior undergrad majored in Biotechnology. I am the designer of work by testing group of Micro-timer and majorly focuses on relative experiments. Personally, besides iGEM, my research interest includes plant-microbe interaction, plant immunity, and plant pathology. It is nice to communicate with all of you.
Zhipei Huang
The art editor of SYSU. Interested in designing and other interesting things. A non-classical medico.
Yingnan Niu
Yingnan Niu, a passionate iGEMer, was in charge of the experiment and wiki editing of bacteria timer. He concerns his team more than anything else in the competition and was keen on coping with communication barriers between members. As a student from the department of life science, he strives to put his core capability in the process of the experiment, which he thought would bring his team to final success.
Yujie Li
This man loves web programming and he always making some interesting website during the free time.
Qiaoxia Liang
Participate in construction of Microtimer 2.0 and Microtimer 3.0. Our Lucky Star: Provided the vital clone through screening in time.
Lizhen Ma
Her name is Super Mary and she is very active. She has been in the iGEM family for only a short time but she has already got a strong feeling on it.She hope our team can go further step by step.
Xinyi Liu
She has joined in the team just for a short period of time. She likes synthetic biology and hopes we can do better and better!

Instructor
Feng Liu
Feng Liu, Assistant Professor of “100 Top Talents Program”, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. Dr. Liu received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular biology at Peking University, China and further got postdoc training in Neurosciences at University of California, San Francisco. Research interest: molecular mechanism of organismal aging and cellular senescence.
Junjiu Huang
Dr. Junjiu Huang is our instructor and coach. As an Associate professor of Cell Biology, he is from Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University. He got his BSc in biochemistry in 2004 and his Ph.D in cell biology in 2009 from Sun Yat-sen University. A major area of his interest is how stem cells keep themselves renewal and what factors can induce stem cells differentiation specially. He has been our coach for several years and we hope we can make further achievement this time.
Advisor
Shuai Jiang
He is our super advisor of the team. He provided us with firmly technical support about our experiment design. It is he who always couraged and helped us to overcome most of obstacles we've met in project. Without his professional knowledge and highly experimental skills about iPS, the experiments we did in mouse iPS and human iPS would be nothing but impossible. He made our idea more clear and beautiful.
Sponsor
Yan Zhang
Professor Yan Zhang is our instructor and fund supporter. Obtained her Ph.D from Hiroshima University, she was appointed Professor in Sun Yat-sen University in 2007 and is the group leader of cancer and stem cell biology. Her research interests are focused on cancer stem cells (CSC) and stem cells, including investigation of CSC biological characteristics, screening key molecules and signaling pathways regulating CSC differentiation or trans-differentiation. Her kind help lays the foundation of our whole project.
Yongjun Lu
Professor Yongjun Lu is our instructor. He is a professor of Sun Yat-sen University, and doctoral supervisor. He is interested in interaction of pathogenic bacteria and host, microbiological resource, and genetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. He has been our advisor for several years and we are lucky to have his kind support.
