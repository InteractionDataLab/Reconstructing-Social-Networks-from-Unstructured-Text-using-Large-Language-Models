Summer School for High School Students
In order to promote iGEM project in a larger group, we conducted several welfare activities for high school students. We gave a public lecture in Shaoxing No.1 Middle School of Zhejiang Province. The theme of the lecture was about today's research of life sciences and the development of synthetic biology. We focused on the analysis of some well-designed projects, such as the Coilsweeper, which was presented by ETH_Zurich in 2014 iGEM Conference. Besides, we introduced a "summer course" for students in Zhixin High School, Guangzhou, Guangdong. Our activities were very successful as most of the students expressed their better understanding to iGEM. Meanwhile, some of the students gave their great thanks to us and decided to keep in touch with us in the future.
2015 iGEM Conference Hosted by National Chiao Tung University
NCTU-Formosa had successfully operated a conference last year and they did a better job this year! 2015 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference was a great success and we are in great honor to be invited.
This year, SYSU_CHINA has presented in NCTU conference. We've prepared a and a poster to introduce our project. Our project named Micro-Timer has really attracted many attenders' eyes, which excited us a lot. It's a solid approval for our project. And the project of the host also left us a deep impression. It's a bold design to use E.coli as probes and the special design had really borden our horizon.
NCTU conference also provided us with a platform to communicate with other schools and teams. Thanks to the conference, we've found some drawbacks in our project when we communicated with other teams, and now we've tried to get rid of them. Besides, we've successfully established cooperative relationships with ZJU, SJTU & THU respectively. NCTU conference is a great communication platform for iGEM teams in Asian Pacific Region. We sincerely hope NCTU conference can attract more teams and become better and better.
Newsletter
We also participate in the newsletter project organized by Amoy_China. We were always keeping in touch with them and our contributions were published on three issues. The topic of each issue is different from each other, so they would make an arrangement in advance with us for our contribution to publish in the next issue. Through the newsletters, we shared the thoughts of how to build an iGEM team and introduced the team members, and most importantly, the detailed illustration of our project. Besides, the both teams shared thoughts about top events at that time and we gave some advices about topic selection. With our cooperation, the bond between both teams becomes stronger; we sincerely wish that the newsletter would be even better in the future! 
SKLBC Meet Up
Our team members participated in the iGEM meet up held by SKLBC-China on 19th,July. Students and teachers from SKLBC-GDSYZX, SYSU-software, SCUT, and SCUT-China also participated in this meet up. First was the ice breaking part, in which all the participants introduced themselves, bringing everybody much closer together. The second part was the presentations from each team. Those who listened were asked to write down their advice and questions and show it to the presented team. During this part we made a brief introduction of our track. Many showed great interest and appreciation to our project, many other appreciated our PPT, and some gave helpful advice. We also discussed many problems of the projects of SCUT with their team members, and talked about some mistakes from the biobricks. The third part was called the world cafe, in which all participants were divided into groups and were asked to discuss over iGEM issues( biosafety, the relationship of software and experiments, etc.). The meet up lasted for 3 hours, and the online discussion is still proceeding. The meet up was very successful, as by sharing and discussing, not only had we gain better understanding of other teams' projects, but also deeper recognition of our own project.
Team Selection
This year, we received an offer to attend SCUT's team selection competition. Prof. Huang had attended the selection competition at 8th July. Professors form SCAU had also presented. Finally, one team got the permission to attend 2015 iGEM competition held in Boston.
Collaboration
Collaboration with ZJU
This year, we cooperated with Zhejiang University in microbial suicide regulation. The project of ZTU this year will use microbial toxins in termite control and prevention, though how to improve strain safety become a important subject. However, one important part of our project is delayed suicide of  microorganisms, so, in the hope of improving safety of their experiments, we provide them a complete regulatory suicide circuit, along which we also provide the detailed data of promotor's inducing expression intensity.
Collaboration with SJTU
This year, SJTU_Software build a biobrick selection assist system based on empirical algorithm. This system can generalize the heat map of different splicing pattern, based on the history record of its splicing sequence in the database, and provide a experiential score to the user. Experiential score is a score that not associated to certain experiment, so a specific situation is needed, which means it grades the results under different experiment condition.
We cooperate with SJTU_Software on the project of experiment grading and result predicting. We would set up multiple parallel experiment groups in the construction and testing of inverted components. These groups are comparable between their designs and results, which would become one of the pivotal parts of our project, and the data extracted from which would meet SJTU_Software’s needs.
Through our cooperation, they can grade our experiment results, then the scores would be compared to our evaluation. To SJTU_Software, the comparison of our experiment results and the design of our plasmids' construction is a case which can directly evaluate their software. And it is also meaningful for us to evaluate the circuits with software, which would be beneficial to improve our future experiments.
