Lab Notebook
Here you can find chronological notes of our lab work, sorted by subtopics.
Heavy metals
Here you find some detailed information about the lab work concerning the construction of our heavy metal biosensors in E. coli. You can see the difficulties we ran into and follow our progress in creating our sensor systems.
Date rape drugs
The detailed process of the construction and characterization of the sensors detecting GBL, GHB and GABA in E. coli, is shown. You find our various methods to obtain the necessary elements from gene synthesis, A. tumifaciens and B. subtilis.
CFPS
In cell free protein synthesis (CFPS), the extracts of lysed cells, containing all the necessary components for transcription and translation, are used to produce proteins in vitro. Find out how we developed and optimized our own cell extract.
PRIA
See how we developed this alternative to standard biosensors, which is based on in vitro interaction of immobilized repressor proteins with plasmids containing the operator site corresponding to the repressor.
Miscellaneous
Here you can find chronological notes of our lab work besides the main topics, e.g. including the Measurement Interlab Study 2015.
