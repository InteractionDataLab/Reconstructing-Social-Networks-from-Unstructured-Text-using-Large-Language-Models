Achievements
Development of a new cell-free assay named Plasmid Repressor Interaction Assay (PRIA) .
Establishment of a Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) system for the iGEM community.
Our CFPS System works perfectly on paper and is long-term storable.
Demonstration of the paper-based CFPS' extensibility for several biosensors .
Construction of a new biosensor for the detection of date rape drugs .
Design and construction of a new biosensor for heavy metals (copper) .
Characterization of multiple biosensors for heavy metals.
Development and implementation of a model for CFPS.
Starting the dual use debate in iGEM including suggestions for new guidelines and discussing the dual use topic on the example of “date rape drugs” .
Programming of an app to quantify fluorescence in pictures generated by our novel filter combination.
Providing a 3D printed black case for fluorescence evaluation.
We build a fully functional device combining CFPS, biosensors, our black case and the app.
