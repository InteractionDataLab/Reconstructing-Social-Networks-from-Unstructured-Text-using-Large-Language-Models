Cell-free Sticks - It works on paper

Project
Our team decided to establish cell-free systems ("cell-free protein synthesis" and "plasmid repressor interaction assay"). For demonstrating the extensibility of our systems we worked with biosensors for heavy metals and we construct a new biosensor for date rape drugs. See what we are doing this year.

Biosafety
Our systems should be cell-free. We confirmed through experiments and experts that our systems contained no genetically modified organisms and are safe to use. Let's see what we've done.
Human Practices
A project is not only lab work. As scientists we need to take responsiblity of what we published and how we appear in public. Among other things we did a dual use essay as we want iGEM to be more aware of biosecurity. Read how iGEM can be a role model for dual use issues.

Team
We are ten master students studying molecular biotechnology, genome-based system biology and molecular cell biology. Curious who we are? Get to know us better!
Notebook
We documented everything we have done in the laboratory and lists protocols, organisms, buffers and primers. If you need more information, check this page.
Partners
An important aspect of iGEM is collaboration. We collaborated with several iGEM teams and helped them for their project. Moreover, you can see who supports us financially. Take a look!
