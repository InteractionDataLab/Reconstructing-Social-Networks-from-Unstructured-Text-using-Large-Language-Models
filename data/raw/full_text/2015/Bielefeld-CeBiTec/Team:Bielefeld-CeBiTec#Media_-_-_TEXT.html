Stock solutions
1.5 M Spermidine and 1 M putrescine solutions are prepared according to supporting material from Yang et al. 2012a . Briefly, a total of 4.59 mL of autoclaved ddH2O  is added in small steps to 1 g of spermidine in a bottle. After each step, the bottle is mixed vigorously and the liquid is poured into a beaker where it is continously stirred. After rinsing out the whole bottle, the homogenous solution is aliquoted, flash freezed and stored at -80 °C. The procedure is similar for putrescine, though volumes differ.
