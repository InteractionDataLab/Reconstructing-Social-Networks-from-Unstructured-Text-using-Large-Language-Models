Therefore, they have been part in a lot of iGEM projects. There are many concepts to create heavy metal sensors. Some of them work extraordinary well. But most of these sensors never made it to real world applications. We aim to make a use of well characterized sensors as well as concepts and new ideas. All this sensor systems shell work on the same principle, so that we can use them to create a modular easy to handle paper based cell free test strip for detection of more substances, heavy metals in this case, in parallel.

&quot;<I>In my opinion the test stripe system has great potential in the field of monitoring contamination in industrial wastewater. It`s a fast and easy available system for qualitative control of several heavy metals.</I>” (Dr.rer.nat. Andreas Bermpohl, manager of Biotec GmbH)</P><DIV class="featurette"><P><B>Why heavy metals?</B>
            Heavy metals are part of Earth’s crust. Therefore, they do occur naturally in our environment. (Heavy Metals - Lenntech) In low doses some of them as copper or nickel are even essential trace elements for animals and humans (Rashmi Verma and Pratima Dwivedi 2013). A major problem is their bioaccumulation, which leads to toxicity and long term effects which include fatal diseases like cancer (Martin <I>et al.</I> 2009), Parkinson`s or Alzheimer’s disease (Gaggelli <I>et al.</I> 2006) (figure 1).  </P></DIV><DIV class="featurette"><P style="margin-top: 0px"><B>Which heavy metals?</B>
            The heavy metal sensors we chose for detection are specific to arsenic, copper, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel. Their concentrations in drinking water are regulated by the WHO, because of their immediate and long term health effects (figure 2).
 </P></DIV><DIV class="featurette" style="padding-top: 20px"><P><B>Our biosensors</B>
            We decided to work with already existing, well-characterized sensors as well as with established but not well-characterized concepts of other teams and moreover create new sensor systems. Therefore, we established a basic construction plan for our sensor systems, which is based on a promoter with a specific operator region in front of a super folder GFP (sfGFP), which was used for detection trough <A href="https://2015.igem.org/team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Design" target="_blank">fluorescence analysis</A>. In addition we used fitting activators or repressors for our inducible promoters under the control of BBa_K608002, which consists of a constitutive promoter with a strong ribosomal binding site (RBS) (figure 3). 
We combined these into a device consisting of constitutive promoter and RBS reverse and the promoter and operator region in upstream of the <I>sfGFP</I>. So we have repressor or activator constitutively expressed in reverse orientation. This was done to minimize the background transcription of the inducible system in upstream of our heavy metal promoter operator system. In addition, these devices are optimized for the usage in a cell free protein synthesis(<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Project/CFPS" target="_blank">CFPS</A>). This is the basis for the development of cell free biosensors on a test strip, which can be used to detect several heavy metals at once in the open field.</P></DIV><P><B>Click on the test strip for more information about the heavy metals and how they can be detected:</B></P><DIV id="arsenic" style="display: none"><H3>Occurrence</H3><P>Arsenic is found in nature in both organic and inorganic forms, typically as arsenite (As<SUP>III</SUP>) or arsenate (As<SUP>V</SUP>). The average arsenic concentration in sea water is about 1-2 µg/L (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Kaur2015">Kaur et al. 2015</A>). Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, China, India, Mexico, and the USA (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#WHO2012">World Health Organization 2012</A>).  Arsenic contamination is most dramatic in Bangladesh, where over one million people suffer from arsenic poisoning. Strong local and seasonal fluctuations in arsenic concentrations make it necessary to test each well regularly (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#vanderMeer2003">van der Meer 2003</A>).</P><H3>Health effects</H3><P>Inorganic arsenic compounds are highly toxic. Acute effects of arsenic intake can range from gastrointestinal distress to death. Chronic exposure can result in skin lesions, vascular diseases and cancer. These chronic effects are referred to as arsenicosis, and there is no effective therapy for them. Due to its toxicity and frequency, arsenic ranks first on the Priority List of Hazardous Substances prepared by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10 µg/L in drinking water, but some countries have adopted a national standard of 50 µg/L (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#WHO2012">World Health Organization 2012</A>; <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Chen2014">Chen, Rosen 2014</A>).</P><H3>Detection</H3><P>Arsenic can be accurately detected by means of techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), atomic fluorescence spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, they are expensive and not suitable for field testing (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Chen2014">Chen, Rosen 2014</A>). 
Chemical test kits are available, which mostly rely on the Gutzeit method. This method is based on the generation of arsine gas from a sample solution. Arsine then reacts with a mercuric bromide impregnated test strip, which results in a color change (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Kearns2010">Kearns 2010</A>). The accuracy and reliability of this method has been called into question (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Rahman2002">Rahman et al. 2002</A>). 
The need for an inexpensive and reliable detection method has led to the development of various arsenic biosensors. Among them are both whole-cell-based and cell-free biosensors.

This operon encodes an efflux pump, which confers resistance against arsenic. The expression is controlled by the repressor ArsR, which negatively autoregulates its own expression. As<SUP>III</SUP> can bind to three cysteine residues in ArsR. The resulting conformational change deactivates the repressor (<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-CeBiTec/Project/HeavyMetals#Chen2014">Chen, Rosen 2014</A>).</P><H3>References</H3><DIV class="references"><P id="Chen2014">Chen, Jian; Rosen, Barry P.

Most of it is produced trough industrial uses (Paustenbach et al. 2003). Chromium intoxication can result in damage to the nervous system, fatigue and mental instability (Singh et al. 2011). Its potential cancerogenity is the result of chromium VI being , able to enter cells , while this is not possible for chromium III compounds. Inside of the cells, chromium IV is reduced to chromium III and can not leave the cells anymore, where it results in oxidative stress reactions (Mitchell D. Cohen et al.). Because of its toxicity the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a limit of 50 µg/L chromium in drinking water.

The human body contains concentrations of 1.4 to 2.1 mg/kg body mass. Copper is ingested through the gut and transferred to most tissues through the liver. It is used in coating alloys and used to make pipes, valves and fittings. Moreover coppersulfate pentahydrate is used in algae control by adding it to surface water. Therefore copper concentrations in drinking water vary widely and range from 0,005 mg/L to 30 mg/L. After the guidelines for drinking water the maximal concentration of copper is 2 mg/L (Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Fourth Edition ).</P><H3>Health effects</H3><P>Copper is essential for human health, but in to high doses it can cause anemia, kidney and liver damage as well as stomach and intestinal irritation and immunotoxicity (ATSDR). A with copper associated disease is Wilsons disease which manifests in a misfunction, so that copper can not be excreted by the liver into bile. If not treated this can lead to brain and liver damage (US EPA ORD NCEA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) 2014).

CopA is the central component in obtaining copper homeostasis, it exports free copper from cytoplasm to the periplasm. This is enabled by copper induced activation of the operon transcription via CueR.

The relatively simple extraction methods and several desirable properties have made it useful to humans. Lead and lead compounds are used in a high variety of products, such as pipes and plumbing materials, solders, gasoline, batteries, ammunition and cosmetics. Therefore, lead plays a major role in the industry and is one of the most used metals. Compared to other metals its occurrence is relative low. Lead can be detected in different parts of the environment, like air, soil and water. 
A high concentration of lead in drinking water is often induced by obstruct pipes that consist of lead or that has a part of lead, respectively. This allow water to be easily contaminated. That is often a problem in houses, where lead is used in household plumbing. Due to the fact that lead is also occurring in water, it could result in adverse health effects (WHO: Fact sheet number 379, Lead poisoning and health).</P><H3>Health Effects</H3><P>Lead has no biological role in the body, but is a highly poisonous metal. The ingestion of lead could affect almost every organ and system in the body (EPA Health Effects: How Lead Affects the body). The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous system. It can have acute or chronic health effects. The acute health effects are occurring immediately after contact with lead. This can be irritation of the eyes or can cause headache, irritability, disturbed sleep, and mood as well as personality changes. Exposure to higher lead concentrations over a long-term could cause serious damage to the brain and to the kidneys. And finally the damage can cause death (Golub, M. S., 2005). The poisoning is mostly resulting of ingestion of water or food, which is contaminated with lead or lead compounds (Ferner, D. J., 2001). It is quickly taken up into the bloodstream and spread in the body (Bergeson, L., 2008). The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 10 µg/L in drinking water, concentrations in drinking water are generally below 5 μg/L. Nevertheless, there are much higher concentrations that have been measured if lead fittings are existing (WHO: Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, fourth edition).
</P><H3>Detection</H3><P>Due to the effects on health, the detection of lead in drinking water is of importance in all parts of the world. Therefore, a simple system for a fast review of the water quality is a worthwhile aim. The method for detection is currently based on the principle of flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) (Abdallah, A. T. and Moustafa, M. A., 2002). This detection method is difficult to implement in developing countries, and time consuming thus there are hardly any quality standards. 
</P><H3>Our lead biosensor</H3><P>For our biosensor we use parts of the chromosomal lead operon of <EM>Cupriavidus metallidurans</EM>.

Additional mercury(II)chloride with a high solubility, and mercury sulfide are found in water. The main natural source of Mercury exposure is through volcanic activity (WHO 2005). Additional, there are many kinds of emission caused by humans. For example mercury contamination can be caused by medical waste (damaged measurement instruments), fluorescent-lamps, chloralkali plants and thermal power plants (Verma <I>et al.</I>, 2013). The natural occurring concentration of mercury in groundwater and surface water are in general less than 0.5 µg/L but can rise to higher concentrations by local mineral deposit. Due to volcanic activity, the mercury concentration in water can rise frequently up to 5.5 µg/L (Izu Oshima Island in Japan) (WHO, 2005).</P><H3>Health effects</H3><P>In the environment, mercury is one of the most toxic elements (L.A. Rojas, 2011). The most toxic compounds are organometallic mercury molecules like methylmercury and dimethylmercury, because they can easily permeate the cellular membrane. These organometallic compounds are better soluble in lipids. Because of this fact, it is easier to permeate the cellular membrane. Acute effects of a mercury intoxication can range from diseases of the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, neuromuscular and neurological problems. Inorganic mercury accumulates in the kidneys and has a long biological half-life, before it is not detectable anymore. In contrast to organic mercury, inorganic mercury is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier or blood-placenta barrier, so it accumulate in the organs (Park <I>et al.</I>, 2012). A chronic intoxication of mercury results in kidney changes, changes in the central nervous system and other effects like cancer (Holmes <I>et al.</I>, 2009, WHO 2005). Additional studies show that mercury generates chromosomal aberrances (WHO, 2005). In addition, a relation between an early exposure of mercury and late initial of Alzheimer`s and other neurodegenerative diseases are discussed (Park <I>et al.</I>, 2012). </P><H3>Detection</H3><P>Mercury can be detected by atomic absorption spectrometry with a detection limit of 5 µg/L and the Inductively Coupled Plasma Method with a detection level of 0.6 µg/L (WHO 2005). In addition, there are different chemical and biological test systems. One of these systems is the detection by ELISA with mercury specific antibodies (Wylie <I>et al.</I>, 1991). </P><H3>Our mercury biosensor</H3><P>For our sensor, we use the <I>mer</I> operator from <EM>Shigella flexneri</EM> R100 plasmid <I>Tn21</I> (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part: BBa_K346002" target="_blank"> BBa_K346002 </A>) and its regulator <I>merR</I> (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part: BBa_K346001" target="_blank"> BBa_K346001 </A>)  constructed by the iGEM team Peking 2010.

Therefore, small amounts of it are found in food, water, soil and air. Nickel concentration in drinking water is normally less than 0.02 mg/L, although through releases from taps and fittings the nickel may accumulate to concentrations up to 1 mg/L. In special cases of release from natural or industrial nickel deposits in the ground, there may be higher concentrations in drinking-water. Through unintended release the concentration can be higher than the guideline value of 0.07 mg/L (WHO: Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, Fourth Edition) 
</P><H3>Health effects</H3><P>Even though nickel is essential for mammals and a part of human nutrition, it may cause dermatitis as well as itching of fingers, hands and forearms by some people, who had long term skin contact. The main source of nickel exposure is food or water, but most people have contact to nickel trough everyday products as jewelry or stainless steel dishware or trough smoking tobacco(US; EPA <I>et al.</I>, 2013). In Germany most drinking water pollutions by nickel happen in the last meters of the plumbing system. Wrong tapware is the main source of nickel contamination in drinking water.

 </P><H3>Detection</H3><P>The two most commonly used analytical methods for nickel in water are atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is used for the determination of nickel detection limit of about 10 μg/L (ISO, 1996). Flame atomic absorption spectrometry is suitable in the range of 0.5–100 μg/L (ISO, 1986). A limit of detection of 0.1 μg/L can be achieved using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Alternatively, electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry can be used.
