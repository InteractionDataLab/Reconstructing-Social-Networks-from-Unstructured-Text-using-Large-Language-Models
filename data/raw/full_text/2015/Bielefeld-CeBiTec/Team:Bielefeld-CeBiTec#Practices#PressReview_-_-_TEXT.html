Press Review
The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about - Oscar Wilde
Media
As part of iGEM we want to raise awareness about the increasing danger of date rape drugs and the health problems occurring due to the uptake of heavy metals in tap water. In order to reach many people with our topic, we decided to write a press release in English and German for the media. Several newspaper and online magazines reported about our project after the publication of this press release. That confirm us that our chosen topic arouses the public’s interest and has a great impact to deal with.

Online magazines
Here are some articles in online magazines:
Chemie.de
OWL-Journal
Bionity

Global News Connect (USA)
Radio
Our project was also mentioned in the radios ( Hertz 87.9 , Radio Bielefeld, Radio Herford and Radio Gütersloh) of the local region East Westphalia-Lippe.
Television
We are also proud to be reported on TV in WDR (West Deutscher Rundfunk) which is one of the most important TV stations in western Germany. We was also interviewed by the university online stream station, Campus TV Bielefeld. Through both interviews on YouTube and on TV we reached many people in the public and demonstrated how handy a cell-free biosensor would be.
