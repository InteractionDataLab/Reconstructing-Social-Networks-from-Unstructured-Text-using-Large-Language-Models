Because research is more fun together.
Collaboration with team Dundee 2015
Team Dundee 2015
Some aspects of our project were similar to team Dundee. They built a chromium biosensor based on the same system we used, the chromate inducible operon of Ochrobactrum tritici 5bvl1. Therefore, we decided to cooperate and exchanged ideas, plasmid maps and sequences. During our collaboration, we realized that they were comparing the original sequence of the repressor to one with the first 15 codons optimized, while our system is based on a complete codon optimized repressor. So we exchanged samples to test in each otherâ€™s systems and look for differences. We were able to measure a combination of our promoter and their repressor in CFPS.
Collaboration with team Santa Clara 2015
Joseph Ayar
As a part of our project, we provide a report about the dual use issue. An aspect of this report is the analysis of the legal situation in different countries, namely the applying laws in Germany, the European Union, and the United States of America. As an expert in the field of law, a member of team Santa Clara (Joseph Ayar, J.D. candidate from University of Santa Clara, School of Law) provided valuable insights in the applying laws and advisory boards in the USA. His analysis is marked as quotes in our report .
Collaboration with team Exeter 2015
Team Exeter 2015
Similar to our project, team Exeter is working with a cell extract to translate proteins. They designed a synthetic toehold switch to detect specific RNA sequences. They aim to use that switch in a cell extract for further use in diagnostics. In terms of collaboration, we communicated via Skype and email. To help them to determine further applications of their project, we calculated the price for a single reaction of our crude cell extract in the size of their reaction and provided a table of contents.
We are thankful to team Exeter for reading our dual use report and giving advice on language style.
Collaboration with iGEM team Freiburg 2015
Team Freiburg 2015
Both Freiburg and our team work on cell free protein synthesis as part of their project. Our team sent a plamid based on BBa_I746909 , containing a translation enhancing sequence (5'-UTR) to team Freiburg. In return, they provided a plasmid containing turboYFP, a his-tag and a halo-tag (Promega). These parts were tested for their usefulness in different cell-free protein synthesis environments.
