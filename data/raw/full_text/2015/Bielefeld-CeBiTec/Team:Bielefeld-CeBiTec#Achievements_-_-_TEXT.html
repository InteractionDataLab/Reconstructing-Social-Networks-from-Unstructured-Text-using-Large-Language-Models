Why we deserve a gold medal
Achievements
Development of a new cell-free assay named Plasmid Repressor Interaction Assay (PRIA) .
Establishment of a Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) system for the iGEM community.
Our CFPS System works perfectly on paper and is long-term storable.
Demonstration of the paper-based CFPS´ extensibility for several biosensors .
Construction of a new biosensor for the detection of date rape drugs .
Design and construction of a new biosensor for heavy metals (copper) .
Characterization of multiple biosensors for heavy metals.
Development and implementation of a model for CFPS.
Starting the dual use debate in iGEM including suggestions for new guidelines and discussing the dual use topic on the example of “date rape drugs” .
Programming of an app to quantify fluorescence in pictures generated by our novel filter combination.
Providing a 3D printed black case for fluorescence evaluation.
We build a fully functional device combining CFPS, biosensors, our black case and the app.
Bronze medal criteria
Register the team and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Submit the judging form.
Create a page on our team wiki with clear attribution to each aspect of our project.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create new standard BioBrick Parts or Device(s) central to our project and submit them to the Parts Registry: BBa_K1758377 .
Create and share a description of the team's project and document the team's parts.
Silver medal criteria
We  conducted several human practices projects , which among other things also include a Dual Use essay and dealing with biosafety questions .
Creation of new BioBricks of our own design and construction which work as expected: BBa_K1758122 , BBa_K1758324 , BBa_K1758361 .
Gold medal criteria
Help another team .
Integration of our human practices projects into our own project especially with the topic date rape drugs .
Establishment of a functional prototype of our biosensors.
Improvement of several BioBricks, such as BBa_K1758102 and BBa_K1758313 .
