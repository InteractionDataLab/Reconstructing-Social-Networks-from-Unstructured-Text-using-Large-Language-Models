Team
This is the iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec Team 2015!
Team Members
There cannot be a good iGEM project without an excellent team! We are ten masters students of the courses Molecular Biotechnology (MBT), Genome Based Systems Biology (GBSB) and Molecular Cell Biology (MCB), and we really enjoyed spending our days and nights together in the lab!

Team Instructors and Advisors
We are actively supported by Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski and guided by advisors who are members of previous iGEM teams from Bielefeld, namely Tore Bleckwehl, Lukas Rositzka, Matthias Ruwe and Manuel Wittchen. During the whole project they were supporting us with their experience and knowledge.

The project would not have been possible without the help of many people.
