3.3.2 Jingjing Group-introduction
To make full use of termites’ character, trophallaxis, to eliminate a whole nest of termites, we have to make sure that the worker termites arrive their nest alive. Meanwhile, there should be enough time for them to complete the process of trophallaxis before the toxins function.
Thus, we design bacteria carriers self-assembled from the generated cellulose nanocrystal (CNC).
The function of carriers
To ensure the worker termites’ safe arriving to the nest, the bacteria shouldn’t be digested until specific stimulus comes . Therefore,  the bacteria will be embedded in nanomaterial which achieve the controlled release of bacteria by stimuli-center-padness..
A carrier also acts as a protection, preventing the bacteria from being released into environment or simply being degraded without completing its mission.
Thus, the material of the carrier should exsit for a period in termites’ guts but finally be digested by stimuli-center-padness. It also should be dense enough to keep the bacteria from leaking and safe enough to be used in environment.
Using CNC as embedding nanomaterial
CNC is used as the embedding nanomaterial of our genetically modified organism because it meets all demands mentioned.
CNC tends to form multiple hydrogen bonds with the surface of the cell so it achieves self-assembly easily. Termites are sure to eat the embedded bacteria because cellulose is also the main composition of wood, which is the staple food of termites.
Meanwhile, the many attractive features of CNCs, such as their inherent renewability and sustainability, high biodegradability and biocompatibility, high strength, large specific surface area, and nanoscale dimension, have led to effective application[],which provide a proper condition to get bacteria embedded.
