Syn-Bio Share Salon
EVENT PLANNING
Why
We have created a series of Poly Cards as a new public education tool of communicating synthetic biology and iGEM projects. For better practice of Poly Cards, we get inspired from TED and hold Syn-Bio Share Salon in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum cooperating with Zhejiang China Association for Science and Technology. In the process of teaching and sharing, we try to promoting synthetic biology to the public, share iGEM projects in recent years, guide them to brainstorm new ideas, and discuss about safety issue about future.
What
For perfect effects, we separated participants into 3 groups.
Presenter：
-Warm video.
-Welcome to Syn-Bio Share Salon. Brief introduction of ZJU-CHINA 2015 and today's share content.
-POLY PAUSE: a rule of the salon to guarantee the good order. When presenter say POLY PAUSE, all participants should stop all current activity, put up right hands and say POLY PAUSE.
-What is gene? (explain in a simple way)
-What is GMO? (a short video from the Internet)
Sharer:
What is synthetic biology? What is biobrick? How to assemble biobricks and make them a device or a system?
-From the point of Lego, sharer tells basic understanding of synthetic biology. Then, with the help of our Basic Poly Cards, sharer can easily explain what are biobricks and how to make biobricks to become a device or a system.
Game time: Snowball
-In the process of introduction of the basic cards repeatedly, participants could remember biobricks easier and thus develop a deeper understanding of synthetic biology.
-Take N cards (N=group members).
Each one takes one card as your new name. Introduce your name and function to others in the group.
The first member, I'm promoter, I'm here to start the circle to function.
The second member, I'm terminator next to the promoter.
The third member, I'm xx next to the terminator next to the promoter.
Our Story
-Introduction of iGEM and share iGEM story and daily laboratory story.
These years, synthetic biology tried to make a better world.
-With the help of Project Poly Cards, share classic iGEM projects in the past few years. In the process of share, participants can develop a deeper understanding about how synthetic biology develop into an application and how they bring positive changes to different areas of the world.
2015, ZJU-CHINA has brought you with TERMITE TERMINATOR.
-Introduce our project in a simple way, making every audience understand what problem do we what to solve, how could we solve the problem and how to apply them into the world is our mission and goal as always.
Show your crazy idea!
-In this link, we tried to provoke member's fantasy and ideas about future changes synthetic biology might be brought to the world. Through group's discussion and cooperation, they brainstorm, discuss, choose final idea, perfect the idea and decide the presentation plan.
From nature, for nature.
-In this link, we shared recent safety issues and our thought about syn-bio safety (as poster shows below), from nature, for nature. And then, inspired participants to think deeply and exchange ideas with each other.
-Final share among groups.
