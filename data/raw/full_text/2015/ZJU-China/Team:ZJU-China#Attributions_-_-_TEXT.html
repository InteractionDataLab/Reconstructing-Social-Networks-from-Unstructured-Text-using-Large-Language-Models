The main part of the project was finished by the 15 students from ZJU-China iGEM team. We 15 undergraduate students built the bio-bricks on our own including tcdA1, metK, Frr, orfX and so on. All of the CNC coating experiments as well as termite simulation experiments were done by students from ZJU-China. Owing to the effort we’ve made for outreach, we got the chance to collaborate with ZJSTM and made great preparation for human practice. We also performed some social research for human practice, we went to communities and areas where the termite problem is serious. All of the propaganda materials were designed by us such as the team uniforms, poly-cards, logo, mascot, name cards and many other art design materials like wiki, poster, banner and so on.

Prof. Chen
our instructor built the connection between our team and the HQ of iGEM, also he did great job in our team construction.
Prof. Mo
our instructor informed us with some basic knowledge of termites, he also provided us with the powerful decoy, which is really significant for our project.
Mr. Liang
an overgraduate student in College of Agriculture and Biotechnology helped us finish the termite simulation experiments including (Cellulase and lysozyme activity measurement, toxic bacteria feeding experiment, trophallaxis verification, avermectin detection in trophallaxis ect.) as our advisor.
Mr. Huang
experimentalist in College of Life Science, helped us with the collaboration between ZJU-China and Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum. And he kept in touch with the high schools we helped so that we could know how we should help them more properly.
Mr. Li Han
Taught us to finish joint transduction between E.coli and Streptomyces avermitilis.
CAU
A professor at CAU pointed out some mistakes in our project and offered us numerous constructive advices to improve our method of avermectin manufacture.
Dr. Yu
Dr. Yu helped us with the CNC part including characterization of CNC, operation of equipment and assistant analysis.
Sommer
Mr. Björn Sommer from Monash University made an image which shows the final shot of the animation illustrating the crystallization process of E. coli. He modeled and rendered the animation of 10 seconds duration with Blender based on a number of different microscopic images supervised by us.

Prof. Li
in Institute of Biochemistry, Zhejiang University offered some constructive suggestions of avermectin manufacture and he pointed out that synthetic pathway should be the very first thing we should consider in avermectin manufacture.
Mr. Zhu
of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum gave us the opportunity to publicize our project as well as synthetic biology. With Mr. Zhu’s help, a small lab with glass walls has been built, which made it more convenient for public to get intuitive feeling of iGEM and synthetic biology.
NYUSH
provided ZJU-China and some other iGEM teams with the chance to show our project to the public, the show can be regarded as one part of our human practice. What’s more, this was also the first show of our cards game “poly-poly” whose aim is to publicize synthetic biology.
Prof. Zhang
from Shandong University provided us with the vital and precious strain TT01, which contains genes called tcdA1 and tcdB1.
Mr. Ding
who is in charge of the lab in which we worked helped us a lot with daily experiment work, keeping the whole lab in order.
Mrs.Li
the faculty in College of Life Science, Zhejiang University solved the financial problem and offered some helpful suggestions for team construction.
