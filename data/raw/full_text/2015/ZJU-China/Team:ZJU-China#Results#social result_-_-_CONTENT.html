The professional institutions allowed experts to design the plan for termite control systematically. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig2: Home Page of Chinese Termite Control Website </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="p1"> In this summer, igemers from ZJU-CHINA visited Hangzhou Institute Of Termite Control to get more information about the current situation of termite control and consult with them about our project design.

For reasons of cost, some people might buy those low-price termitcides on shopping websites. However, those cheap drugs have a great possibility to be harmful to nature environment. For this reason, ZJU-IGEMers tried to promote the idea of ‘From Nature For Nature’ to realize the environment-friendly synthetic biological method to termite control--------Termite Terminator. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig6: low price of insecure termitcide on shopping website </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig7: The theme of Termite Terminator---Form Nature For Nature </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4 class="hh4-left" id="pos10">Termite control companies</H4><P class="p1"> Termite control in the U.S consists of two main parts------commercial corporations and government agencies. Commercial corporations often provide citizens housing termite control services, and government agencies do better at the maintenance of public facilities. </P><P class="p1"> The U.S has a complete service system of pest-control companies. When people have problems of termite damage, they usually look for a company to solve them. However, as what is happening in China, some people would like to deal with termites by themselves, so some companies also provide customers advisors to treat termites in a suitable way. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig1: Page of termite control of a pest control company in the U.S http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/termite.htm </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig2：the top 5 pest control companies on consumer affairs http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/aaa_pest_control.html#buyers-guide </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4 class="hh4-left" id="pos11">Termite Control: China vs. America</H4><P class="p1"> Although Chinese has a much higher population density than America, there are more wood structure buildings in America, the level of termite damage in both countries are randomly the same. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 textcenter"><DIV class="col-md-6 img-100"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig3: termites in the U.S </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 img-100"><DIV class="cpleft"><P class="kuvateksti"> Fig4: termite nest in China </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="p1"> Both Chinese and American governments have done a lot to deal with termite damage, but they are different in some way. </P><P class="p1"> Chinese termite control institute has a low charging standard, because government pays them the fundamental funds and technical assistance for local institute.

Buy pesticide yourself or look for professional institute? </P><P class="p1"> Question3#: </P><P class="p1"> The governmental institutes VS. Termite control companies. Which one do you trust more? </P><P class="p1"> Question4#: </P><P class="p1"> Would you choose the pesticide, which has a bad impact to the environment but works fast and has a lower price? </P><P class="p1"> Question5#: </P><P class="p1"> Would you like to choose biological control method, which is much safer but costs more? </P><P class="p1"> Investigation result: </P><P class="p1"> Question1： </P><P class="p1"> More than 70% of our interviewee have experienced termite damage, and they all know that termites can destroy woods with a super speed. One security told us his real experiment of termite damage. </P><P class="p1"> “ I bought a small apartment in Xiacheng district in 2006, but I didn’t live in it because I got a job in Beijing that year. In 2008, I went back to Hangzhou and planned to marry with my girlfriend, so we went to that apartment together. I was totally shocked by the scene. All the wooden furniture had been damaged by termites. The door case became into powder, all the chairs could not be used, and the reproductive termites lay on the windows. We can’t even open the windows…… We called Hangzhou institute of termite control for help, and it took nearly one year to eliminate all the termites in my apartment. I threw the damaged furniture and fit my house again….” </P><P class="p1"> Although some people have experienced the damage brought by termites, the public didn’t know much about the current issue about termites in Hangzhou. It still needs to be broadcasted. </P><P class="p1"> Question 2: Almost 50% of interviewees would choose professional institute, and another 50% prefer to buy pesticide themselves. Some of people who choose professional institute are those who know the severity of termite damage, for example, the security mentioned above. The others are those who have a higher level of knowledge, they know that they couldn’t eliminate termites just by themselves. But those who didn't know much about the termites would like to buy pesticide, they think they can win the termites. (Too young too simple) </P><P class="p1"> Question 3: 20% of our questioned people thought they might compare their cost, then make the decision. Most of the interviewees would choose governmental institutes, because they thought it would be more reliable. </P><P class="p1"> Question 4：More than half interviewees prefer to choose cheap pesticide instead of safe environment-friendly biological drugs. The reasons are below: Pesticide is more convenient and cheap, it can be easily purchased by shopping website. It works fast and a little poison won’t do too much harm to people. </P><P class="p1"> However, nearly 30% people thought health is at the 1st rank, so they would like to choose biological drugs. </P><P class="p1"> Question 5：Citizens that choose biological way care more about safety. A majority of them are middle class and well-educated people. One female white collar pointed out that, it doesn’t matter how much it costs, the most important thing is to live healthily. People that do not choose biological drugs have two main reasons, one is that cheap and valid chemical is enough for them to use. The other is that the cost of biological method is too much, it is not necessary to pay for it. </P><P class="p1 textcenter"><B>Summary</B></P><P class="p1"> 1. Citizens do not know much about Termites’ living habits and their current condition, but they all have heard about the information of termites. </P><P class="p1"> 2. People are willing to choose professional institute to control termites, but if their scale is not very large, people may choose kill termites by themselves. </P><P class="p1"> 3. Governmental institutes have more public trust. People prefer to call for governmental institutes to eliminate termites </P><P class="p1"> 4. Chemical insecticide costs less and the low-dose poison won’t be harmful to human being. Most citizens do not know the significance of ‘environment-friendly’ and do not care about the problem, and they prefer chemical termitcide. </P><P class="p1"> 5. The biological control system of ZJU-CHINA cost more. Some of interviewees would like to choose environment-friendly lifestyle, but most people will make their decision depend on the killing effect. </P><P class="p1 textcenter"><B>Conclusion</B></P><P class="p1"> The product made by ZJU-CHINA could be promoted by virtue of government’s official platform. We also have to advertise the idea of environmental-friendly and biological safety, devoting to lower the cost at the same time. We believe that, our product will be better supported and applied in the future. </P></DIV></ARTICLE><ASIDER id="popView2"><HEADER>Social Result</HEADER><UL id="nav2"><LI><A href="#pos1    "><B>Current</B></A></LI><LI><A href="#pos2    ">Housing</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos3    "> Trees</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos4    ">Facilities</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos5    "><B>China</B></A></LI><LI><A href="#pos6    ">History</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos7    ">Institutes</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos8    ">Market</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos9    "><B>U.S</B></A></LI><LI><A href="#pos10    ">Companies</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos11   ">China vs. America</A></LI><LI><A href="#pos12  "><B>Investigation</B></A></LI></UL></ASIDER></DIV><ASIDE id="popView1"><HEADER>Team</HEADER><UL id="nav"><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:ZJU-China/Results">Experiment Result</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:ZJU-China/Results/social_result">Social Result</A></LI></UL></ASIDE><DIV id="gl-footer" class="cf" style="max-width:1440px"><DIV id="gl-footer-copyright" class="cf"><DIV class="gl-col1 cf"><SPAN>© 2015 ZJU-IGEM TERMINATE.</SPAN></DIV><UL class="gl-col2 cf"><LI><A href="http://www.igem.org/Main_Page">IGEM</A></LI><LI><A href="http://www.zju.edu.cn">Zhejiang University</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
