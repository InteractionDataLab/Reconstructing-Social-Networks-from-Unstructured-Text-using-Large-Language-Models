Seminar
On 2015/9/13, ZJU-China iGEMers held a synthetic biology seminar in College of Life Science, Zhe Jiang University. In the seminar, we introduced synthetic biology, iGEM Jamboree and our project to the schoolmates.

Gao Jiahao gave a detailed introduction to synthetic biology. He divided his lecture into four different parts—introduction, design, model and examples. In the introduction fraction, he told the audience the concept of synthetic biology, the engineering research idea. Then, he presented some basic engineered genetic circuits, including AND gate circuit, OR gate circuit, impulse oscillatory circuit…He stressed the significance of modelling by giving some interesting examples. For instance, he introduced the production of artemisinin by engineered E.coli. We then played POLY CARDS with them. Through the game, they gained a better understanding of synthetic biology with joy.

Then, our teammates introduced iGEM to the Zhejiang University students. We told them the history and core objectives of iGEM. We further explained how a team is organized, registered and administered. They were all attracted by the innovative and engineering ideas of iGEM, and showed great interest in it.
In order to give the audience a more specific impression of synthetic biology and iGEM we introduced our project—Termite Terminator. We gave a very concrete lecture about it, including toxins manufacture, CNC coat, termite simulation experiments, modelling and human practice. After the presentation, the audience asked many questions about our project, which showed their passion and interest.
