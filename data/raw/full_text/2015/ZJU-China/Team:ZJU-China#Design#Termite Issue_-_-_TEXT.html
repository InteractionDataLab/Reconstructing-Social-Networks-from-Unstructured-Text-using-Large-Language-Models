Termite Issues
Damage and demand
Termites are a kind of insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of order Isoptera. They are also known as ‘white ants’. However, they are totally different from ants.
Termites are widely spread and they are among the most destructive insects in terms of damage and control costs. Termites almost occupy everywhere in tropical and subtropical regions. They feed on wood, so a great number of houses and infrastructures are destroyed by them. In addition, they are also known to damage non-cellulosic materials, chewing through the insulation on buried electrical and telephone cables.
It is estimated that the cost of damage and control of Formosan termites is $2 billion in the US.

The features of termites
It seems eminently sensible to treat the colony as the individual organism. If a termite is separated from the nest, it will die, for each caste lacks the ability to survive alone. The colony organism divides its functions through its inanimate and animate parts, as follows:
Reproduction and dispersal (alates, queens, king)
Construction, feeding and tending (workers):
Active defence (soldiers)
Protection, homeostasis, fortification (nest, mound)
Only workers forage to feed other caste termites. This process is called trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective method of nutritional tactics to converse and recycle components that are nitrogenous.
Current strategies for termite control
The method for termite control for over 50 years has been the chemical choice. However, the use of these chemicals causes great environment and health concerns. Some of the chemicals are even banned.
Nowadays, IPM (Integrated Pests Management) is one of the most advanced techniques to control termites around the world. Generally, it is a monitoring and baiting system. Termite presence is examined on a regular basis. Application of toxin only when termites are present makes baiting systems an environmentally friendly approach.
