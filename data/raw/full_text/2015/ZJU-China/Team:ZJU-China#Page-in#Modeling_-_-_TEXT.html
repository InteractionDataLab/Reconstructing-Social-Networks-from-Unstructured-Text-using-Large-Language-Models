Modeling
Termite Simulation
We have studied the generating and decomposition of CNC-coat, to help to manufacture better production.
Mass transfer model
With the artificial intelligence group simulation, device user will be able to obtain a optical bait location.
Degradation model
To ensure that the Toxin will not be spread, we build model to predict the allowance of Toxin exposed to air.
