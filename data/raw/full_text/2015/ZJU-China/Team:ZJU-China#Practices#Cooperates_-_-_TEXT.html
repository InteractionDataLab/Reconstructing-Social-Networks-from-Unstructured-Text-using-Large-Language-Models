High Schools
ZJU-China attaches much interest in communication with other teams. It’s very necessary to know more about others and to help each other is the very tradition of Zhejiang University. This year, we helped H4Z to get started in iGEM, helped HZAU with modeling and provided BNU with two important gene circuits.
To help H4Z, we held some seminar in Zhejiang ST, in which we talked a lot about how to run an iGEM team and what should be paid attention to in an iGEM project. Also, we did our experiment in the same lab so we got even more time to help them. In the modeling part, our dry lab helped them write their wiki in a technical way.
The picture of teaching high school teams to do experiment.
BNU
To help BNU, we construct two gene circuit containing an inducer coding region and a switch, which is significant in their project of controlling nematode. We sent E.coli containing the circuit with the switch to them so that they can put their target gene into both sides of the switch to complete their whole circuits for submission.
The first gene circuits we built for BNU.

HZAU
HZAU, the university in China, is going to design a device which controls the brightness directly  with the help of computer. One of the core technologies is the SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) programming. While their team is not as familiar with SCM as our Dry Lab member, we provide some useful software such as keil and TCP-ISP. What's more, we shared them some template program sources written by ourself, as well as other online help.
Completed the SCM program for HZAU and they affirmed our help
NCTU Meetup
In Formosa, we shared our ideas to each other, here is photo of ZJU-China and NTU.
In Jul 19-24, we attended in the Asian Conference in the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu where we made our presentation in that conference to share our idea and project to many Asian teams so that we could get everyone know our idea. In addition, we brought every team gift, the special candy named “Big Termite”, which made everyone feel great about that. We did a lot of work to prepare our presentation and poster to make sure everyone there can understand what we’re doing even get inspired by us.
