QIAquick® PCR Purification Kit
add 5 volumes Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR reaction and mix. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow
place a QIAquick column in a provided 2 ml collection tube
to bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube
to wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube
centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
place each QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
to elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0– 8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge
if the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel
