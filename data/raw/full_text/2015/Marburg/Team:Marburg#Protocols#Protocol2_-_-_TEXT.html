Competent E.Coli cells (Electroporation)
Prepare all the media (SOB, 10 % glycerol); prechill a GS3 rotor 4°C; sterilize centrifuge tubes by autoclaving and prechill them!
Inoculate 30 mL SOB with single colony from a fresh plate and grow them o/n at 37°C.
Inoculate 1 L SOB (1:100 ie. 10 mL of the starting culture per 1 L SOB) and grow it at 37°C on a shaker with 200 rpm until it reaches an OD600 of 0.4-0.5 (approx. after 4 h). Continue with all working steps on ice or 4°C!
Centrifuge the cells at 4.000 rpm / 20 min / 4°C.
Wash with 1 vol. 10 % glycerol.
Centrifuge at 4.000 rpm / 20 min / 4°C.
Wash with 0.5 vol. 10 % glycerol.
Centrifuge at 4.000 rpm / 20 min / 4°C.
Wash with 0.1 vol. 10 % glycerol.
Centrifuge at 4.000 rpm / 20 min / 4°C.
Go to get liquid nitrogen.
Add 0.5 - 1 mL 10 % glycerol (per liter liquid culture started with) and resuspend pellet and prepare aliquots of 100 µL in 1.5 mL reaction tubes and freeze them immediately in liquid nitrogen.
Store the electrocompetent cells at -80°C.
SOB-Media -> weight in:
20 g Bacto Tryptone
5 g Bacto Yeast Extract
0.5 g (8,6 mM) NaCl
2.5 mL (2,5 mM) KCl (from 1 M stock)
add 1000 mL of H2O
test for pH (it should be around pH = ~ 6.8 - 7.0)
autoclave
add sterile
10 mM MgCl2
10 mM MgSO4 f
10 % glycerol-solution:
get 116 mL of 86 % glycerol
add 1000 mL of H2O
autoclave
