Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator™-5
In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 2-7 volumes of DNA Binding Buffer to each volume of DNA sample (see table below). Mix briefly by vortexing.
Application
DNA Binding Buffer : Sample
Plasmid, genomic DNA (>2 kb)
2:1
PCR product, DNA fragment
5:1
ssDNA
7:1
Transfer mixture to a provided Zymo-Spin™ Column in a Collection Tube.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds. Discard the flow-through.
Add 200 µl DNA Wash Buffer to the column. Centrifuge for 30 seconds. Repeat the wash step.
Add ≥ 6 µl DNA Elution Buffer or water directly to the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for one minute. Transfer the column to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 30 seconds to elute the DNA.
