Composite Part
During our Measurement Study we learned a lot about the characterization of BioBricks and how important standardization for synthetic biology is.Therefore we designed and constructed a composite part (two promoters constitutively expressing both GFP and RFP) that is ideal for promoter characterization. By changing the promoter that controls the GFP you can normalize your promoter by an internal standard. This reduces the variation of plasmid number in the cell. With this part we improved the characterization of BioBrick parts.
