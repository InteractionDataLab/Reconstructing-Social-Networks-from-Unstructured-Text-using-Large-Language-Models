Preparation of the SDS-Gel
prepare the separating gel (for 2 gels):
Acrylamide percentage
12%
H2O
3.2 ml
Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide(30%/0.8% w/v)
4 ml
1.5M Tris(pH=8.8)
2.6 ml
10% (w/v)SDS
0.1 ml
10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS)
100 μl
TEMED
10 μl
fill the gel into the casting frames
cover gel with isopropanol
wait for 20-30min to let it gelate
prepare the stacking gel (for two gels):
Acrylamide percentage
5%
H2O
2.975 ml
0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8
1.25 ml
10% (w/v) SDS
0.05
Acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide(30%/0.8% w/v)
0.67 ml
10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS)
0.05 ml
TEMED
0.005 ml
discard isopropanol and fill in the stacking gel
insert the comb without trapping air under the teeth
wait for 20-30min to let it gelate
set the cell into the cell buffer dam, take out the comb and pour the running buffer into the chamber
Preparation of Samples
mix samples (OD = 1.0) with 100 μl sample buffer (1x):
denaturate samples at 95°C for 10 minutes
load 10 μl sample-solution into wells
