Receive standard plasmid
1. Gain standard plasmid
2. Transformation:
Result: After 16~24h overnight culturing, sJanus, sJanus-m and inJanus grow colonies about one microns in diameter, evenly distributed. But inJanus-m’ colonies are relatively rare and small. Try to going on to check out
3. Strain reservation and plasmid extraction
Results: Four tube plasmid concentration is about 100 ng/uL, suitable for next steps
4. Striction Digest
I choose Xba I and Pst enzyme
5. Electrophoresis
Results: We have strips of about 2000. We can basically ensure correct standard transformation
6, DNA gel extraction   
Results: Four tube plasmid concentration is 4.9, 6.0, 9.4, 6.2 ng/uL.
 
Prepare aimed protein DNA
1. Design primers.
2. PCR 50 uL system:         
 
ddH2O
33uL
10Xbuffer
5uL
dNTP
5uL
Template
1uL
Enzyme
1uL
Primer
2.5+2.5u
 Put in PCR system, set up annealing temperature, recycle and start PCR.
3. Electrophoresis
Results: Strips of a 200 is aimed proteins. At first time, we set,58,60,62℃,but we can’t get aimed band, just a very bright band much smaller than aimed DNA. We think its primer   dimer , then we set 50,55,60℃at second time. We can get aimed DNA from 55-60℃.
4. DAN extraction
5. Restriction enzyme digestion
6. Electrophoresis
7. DAN extraction
Use the same enzyme as one in aimed DNA.
 
Connection 
1. Connection
2. Transformation
3. Plasmid extraction
   The concentration is 60, 43, 70, 83 ng/mL
4. Enzyme digestion   
5. Electrophoresis
Result: I repeat 4 times. In first time there aren’t any 200 bond. I suspect it’s something wrong in enzyme digest. And then I use four pair of enzymes to cut it. There is just no 200 bond. At the fourth time, I choose to extend digestion time and smaller enzymes of XbaI and PstI. Then we have two stripes: about 200 and 2000 molecular   weight .
6. Sequencing:
Almost correct except some wrong sequence in the front of the aimed proteins.
