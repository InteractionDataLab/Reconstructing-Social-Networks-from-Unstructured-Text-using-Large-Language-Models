Project Design
1.  Janus is nontoxic
Our project is on the basis of two classes of Janus-inJanus, sJanus and their respective mutants. inJanus is first discovered in Grifola frondosa, which is an edible mushroom. And sJanus is first found in Trichoderma reesei, which is concluded by Environment Canada and Health Canada to be nontoxic. Thus, we have good reasons to believe there isn't any safety problem about Janus.
2. Our new applications are more environment-friendly
About our Stimulated Plastic Emzymolysis project, there is no doubt that it is environment-friendly. It not only helps to solve the plastic pollution problem, using the ezymolysis way not just landfill, incineration and chemical decomposition, but also enhances its effect.
Lab Work
In order to avoid danger and train our team member, everyone accepted the biological safety test even some of our members in charge of wiki. Of course, they all qualified. What’s more, when we formally conducted experiments, every member will be supervised by our instructors and each other. If we found who conducted work nonstandardly, we will punish him/her by being on duty at that day. And all our waste are discarded safely, strictly followed stipulations of our school.
We chose BL21 (DE3) as our expressing strain, and we first constructed expression vectors in E. coli DH5alpha. In the process, use kits which are safe to extract, construct and transform our plasmids. ALL THE ORGANISM we use in our lab are safety level 1 organisms. We conducted our operations on open clean benches and all the waste contains microorganisms are sterilized before further dispose to ensure safety. According to the situation, we will choose to wear protective equipment.
And the following is our regulations of lab:
Be sure that you have worn protective equipment if necessary.
Be sure that you have informed the instructor of the next step of the experiment plan and gotten the permission of him.
Keep the super clean bench clean and operate correctly.
Properly handle the waste generated in the experiment.
Clean the table after the experiment.
Make the experiment record and finish experiment results in time.
Shipment
To achieve safe shipment, we consulted a number of international express delivery companies and have chose one of the most suitable company for our team. ln addition, we have sended the samples to DGM-China to carry out the safety identification.
