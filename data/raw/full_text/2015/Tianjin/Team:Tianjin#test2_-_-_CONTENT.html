The four directions including fusion protein, plastic degradation with hydrophobin, protein sensing chip, vegetable and fruit preservation with hydrophobin. Today, according to the papers we had seen, everyone shared the knowledge we had harvested with others.
Then, the human-practice group showed us the arrangements of the fourth Crabapple Season, which is the biggest popularization of science in our school. The modelling group also showed us the knowledge they have learned.
Finally, the wiki&amp;design group showed us the original design of our team logo and ask us for some advice.

As for the wet-lab group, we decided to make three research directions including fusion protein, plastic degradation with hydrophobin, protein sensing chip. In the past week, each group had searched for related papers and designed specific experimental process. At this meeting, we reported our preliminary experimental process to our teacher. The teacher pointed out our mistakes and shortcomings.

Each group of wet-lab showed us the improved experimental process, listed the reagents and instruments to be used in the experiment. The teacher gave us a lot of advice.
The human-practice group summed up their process and written a summary of the fourth Crabapple Season.

Through the communication with the plastic degradation group, we found that there are also some mistakes in the model, but the Modelling group would correct them in time.

At the same time, we have to start planning Human Practices activities, and put forward three or four different solutions.
The molecular cloning team had planned to finish the standardization of the plasmid and the expression plasmid, but the experiment encountered some problems£¬the progress of the experiment needed to be delayed.
The wiki group had collected some photos and other materials which is needed for the web pages
The modeling group continues to study the use of all kinds of software, and to develop a reasonable modeling program

Each of the experimental group leader £¬each of wiki group member and the modeling group need to prepare a summary of the work which is carried out in the few months.

Any personal reason, including practice, creating, research summer camp, travel, exam, are not allowed to leave, unless very special circumstances, but it will have punitive measures, such as arrangements to brush all tube, cleaning and so on, and may deduct vacation time. The specific arrangements need to be developed according to the experimental progress.
The molecular cloning team shows the progress of the work in the form of PPT. The wiki group showed the construction of the site. They will be shown to be roughly. The presentation group divided the contents of the show into following parts: project design, experimental results, modeling, HP and others.
