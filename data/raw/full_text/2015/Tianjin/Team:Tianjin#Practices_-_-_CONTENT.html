Thus, we went to General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University to get experts’ professional advice and investigate the needs of patients. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Talks &amp; Media</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We held panel discussions and attended various meetings and seminars in order to exchange ideas and refine our project. Meanwhile, we presented our project with more in-depth details to more than thirty Chinese iGEM teams in Central China iGEM Consortium. (More details) Besides, not only did we utilize online media involving Twitter, Wechat, Renren Blog and wiki to expand the influence of our activities and synthetic biology, but were involved to write Biweekly Newsletter, which can be regarded as a collection of information and introduction about most iGEM teams and a better access to exchange teams’ ideas conveniently. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG>Survey Questionnaire</STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In  the process of building a new iGEM team, we discovered several problems in the  development of iGEM in China. As a result, in order to investigate the current  situation of iGEM at home and abroad, and find solutions for our team and more  Chinese teams, we designed and carried out a survey questionnaire on university  involvement in iGEM. More than one hundred iGEMers replied to assist us in  gathering iGEMers’ perspectives and feelings.  </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Team Collaboration  </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In  cooperation with other ten iGEM teams, we collected issues of each team and  posted a questionnaire in order to understand different people’s views on project-related  issues in different regions of the world and make publicity for synthetic biology.  Also, our team members visited and communicated with some teams in depth such  as Tsinghua-A and NKU. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"> </P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Seek Sponsors</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We contacted with more than one hundred companies, most of which are biotechnology companies. We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal. When looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained the sponsor fees but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology. With the opinions from the experts, we can better our project. Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting workers and experts.(More details)</SPAN></P></DIV><DIV id="content-in"><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px;">Educational &amp; Public Engagement</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Science &amp; Education Exhibition</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On Saturday 4th April 2015, Tianjin University opened its doors to the general public for its fourth White Crabapple Season Open Day, where this year we hosted a stand. Over 30,000 people entered our campus throughout the day and visited our Science &amp; Education Exhibition. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG>Figure1</STRONG>.do biological experiments for public</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Our team spared no efforts for this exhibition aiming at spreading knowledge related to synthetic biology and information about iGEM to non-specialists such as primary and secondary school students. Before TJU Campus Open Day, we posted an article concerning IGEM and the science exhibition on WeChat platform, which grabbed more than five hundred people's attention. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG>Figure2</STRONG>.bring children into the magic biological world</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On that day, public were attracted by our Science &amp; Education Exhibition and it's believed that they could resist the charm of synthetic biology no longer. Specifically, we conducted a variety of hydrophobin-related experiments and prepared bizarre microbial colonies exhibitions which could be observed by anyone under a microscope and had a strong appeal to the audience. Besides, we designed fun games about biology in order to attract the crowds. The forms of fun games contained answering biological questions when jumping rope, identifying plant organelles ,  and explaining what iGEM is , what synthetic biology is, and describing our project in more detail after reading our poster about iGEM and our team. Additionally, visitors and students were able to harvest our elaborate theme postcards or badges about iGEM after they completed games and answered questions correctly. We also encouraged the people we spoke to to share their feelings and concerns about the Science &amp; Education Exhibition and synthetic biology.</SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG>Figure3</STRONG> .the elaborate theme postcards and badges about iGEM</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The event was a huge success. Over 30,000 people visited the open day, and our stall was constantly busy for at least 8 hours until we handed out all elaborate gifts and snacks. Through our exhibition and individuals' active engagement, more citizens got to know about our iGEM team and more students became more stimulated in learning synthetic biology. Also, some academics discussed about our project with us and we exchanged views.

Some students of engineering majors and nearly half of freshmen of life science major attended this science lecture. Chenmao told them about what iGEM is and described our project in plain terms. Yige explained to them about what synthetic biology is and some practical and stimulating ideas about synthetic biology. Then, Prof. Yang shared his idea on what synthetic biology would best be used for. Finally, Xuemei showed students 20 minute TED lecture by Juan Enriquez that told us about profound changes genomics will bring in business, technology, and society.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Both students of engineering majors and life science major enjoyed the science lecture, with some students commenting on synthetic biology--it was &quot;so cool&quot;! Several of freshmen also sincerely thanked us for the science lecture, and said that they were eager to be iGEMers next year. Overall, we held a science lecture related to synthetic biology and our project, which received a great response and sparked students' curiosity towards synthetic biology. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG>social practice report</STRONG>,</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The end of September, the yearly social practice report will be held in Student Activity Center of Tianjin University.

In some degree, we will show our activities in front of the whole school and lead them into the fascinating world of synthetic biology.</SPAN></P></DIV><DIV id="content-in"><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; color: black;">Recycling &amp; Reusing PET</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Is waste PET Really</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;"> <STRONG>That Big A Deal?</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In 2007, there were more than four (4) billion pounds of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles that were burned or ended up in landfills, roadsides, streams and oceans. With the rapid increase in production of PET, there is more and more waste PET discharged into the nature.  Although PET is versatile due to its high inertness, nontoxic nature and moldability into various useful products, it is non-biodegradable. The products of PET can become a huge waste after their useful life is over. It will occupy quantity of space and the landfill or incineration can be harmful to the environment, so the recycling and reuse of the waste PET has become one of the major subjects of environmental protection. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Figure1</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN style="font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">. waste PET bottles</SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Recycling And Reusing Of PET In Western Countries</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At present, PET recycling method can be divided into physical recycling method and chemical recycling method [1] In foreign countries, PET is mainly recycled by chemical recycling method, that is, depolymerizing PET into terephthalic acid (TPA), dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), ethylene glycol (EG) and so on, then take advantage of intermediate raw materials (BHET) or monomer (TPA, DMT, EG, etc.) [2], which can be aggregated into PET or synthetic polyurethane, unsaturated resins, etc. There is no denying that it is one of the most effective and scientific way of dealing with PET waste. Also, there are some new ideas in Canada and America.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For example, The Planet Bottle (TPB) is designed to oxo-biodegrade through the inclusion of Reverte additive. The Plant Bottle is manufactured from sugar cane and virgin PET pellets, 35% and 65% respectively, They have been advocating a total switch to 100% rPET – with Reverte – to deal with the reality that some companies are largely unsuccessful in their weak pursuit of a socially responsible position on recycling and reuse. They said, &quot;We think that recycling is good, but 100% rPET with Reverte is best &quot;.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In January 2009, ENSO Bottles, of Phoenix, Arizona was introducing a biodegradable PET plastic bottle that could change the way we think about plastic.

Compared with physical recycling method, chemical recycling method makes it easier to develop circular economy and has better prospects.

One of lecturers, Prof. Wu, who is devoting himself to producing engineering plastics based on recycling PET bottle, primarily told us about the current situation of recycling waste PET. Prof. Wu said that China recycled about 1000 tons PET bottles last year, half of which were imported. He said foreign countries usually recycle PET waste bottles into PET new bottles, which has mature technology but costs a lot of money while domestic plants usually recycle PET waste bottles into PET fiber and textile auxiliaries, The technology is hard to come out PET fiber with high quality so that many plants stopped their production. And the technology used to generate cotton fabric has been evaluated for performance and found to give good results. The chemicals used during depolymerization and reuse of PET are inexpensive and comparatively less harmful to the environment, which offer advantages in the chemical recycling of polyester waste.

In his perspective, the key points of recycling waste PET were lowering the standards of PET bottles’ quality and good performance of recycled products. Therefore, they created unique secondary processing technology to generate engineering plastic which possesses a fine plasticity like metals and can be knocked by a nail like a wood block, aiming at manufacturing engineering plastics PET/PE alloy(special pipe material) ,solving the recycling and regeneration industry of waste PET and upgrading PE pipe industry.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Environmental Impact And Economic </SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: &quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;,sans-serif; color: black;">Analysis Of Our Project</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">After knowing about the status quo of Chinese recycling of waste PET, we interviewed plastic-related experts after the seminar in order to seek for experts’ assessment of our project and explore the prospect of its development. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When asked about the significance and the possibility of industrialization of facilitating enzyme degradation of plastics, Prof. Wu directly affirmed that our ideas was of great value and did good to environmental protection. The original intention of our project is to protect the environment and reduce the environment load. Not only is enzyme degradation an environmentally benign and highly efficient pathway, but we don’t need to consider processing temperature range of polyester that must be concerned during </SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">thermal degradation of polyester. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Nonetheless, Prof. Wu let us know that we will still have a long way to go if we want to put our project into practice. The primary issue is the cost of the budget, and it doesn’t mean cost of enzyme degradation technology, but it is about investment in PET bottle recycling process. Specifically, it should be concerned about the sorting of plastic bottles, the separation of bottles, cover and tags and the process of crushing, washing and drying. Specially, PVC bottles are hard to tell apart from PET bottles, but one stray PVC bottle in a melt of 10,000 PET bottles can ruin the entire batch. For this reason, it's understandable why purchasers of recycled plastics want to make sure that the plastic is sorted properly. Equipment to sort plastics is being developed, but currently most recyclers are still sorting plastics by hand (and in the third world), which is a hard, expensive and time-consuming work. In a word, plastics also are bulky and cumbersome to collect. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Prof. Wu added that, however, if there was no better way to solve the environmental problems caused by waste PET, it would be really crucial to study the degradation of PET. In the present age, domestic plants usually recycle PET waste bottles into useful textile auxiliaries such as spinning fiber which cannot be utilized widely. If the production of spinning is too excessive to be exhausted someday, other methods of recycling waste PET such as enzyme degradation will be considered. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">After that, we asked a female expert. She said, in some cases, the recycled and modificated PET is even more easily than the new one. In other words, the economic value of new material may not high. Thus, if we can guarantee the efficiency of enzyme degradation with the aid of hydrophobin and the appropriate cost of sorting and recycling of waste PET, it will be feasible to put our project into practice for reducing the environmental effects of PET and cleaning up the world.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Plastic is one of indispensable materials in daily life. With the astonishing development of biological industry, researchers focus their attention on biodegradation of waste PET. Undoubtedly, if we can successfully find a kind of bacteria used in highly efficient degradation of PET, biodegradation will be the best way to address the waste PET pollution fundamentally. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">[1] Xiaochun W.&amp; Jianfei Z.

However, main methods have some drawbacks. For example, the acquisition of histological specimens causes a kind of trauma that brings unacceptable pain to patients. Meanwhile, imaging method is difficult to be used widely for early diagnosis as they may not detect small tumors, for one thing, they usually cannot detect small tumors with diameters less than 0.5-1 cm during early HCC diagnosis. The development of proteomic technologies makes it possible to screen and discover novel serum biomarkers for cancers. Scientists have already found some differential proteins which are potential cancer biomarkers, and these proteins have close correlations with cancer initiation and progression. Besides, antibody microarray, a new proteomic technology, has been established for cancer serum biomarker discovery. Antibody microarray is a high-throughput method with high sensitivity and specificity, and integrates multiple detections into a mini-system. Multiple antibodies are immobilized on the surface of chips, and then this chip can be subjected to detect levels of various proteins in a sample simultaneously [1] </SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">We were decided to hear more stakeholders' voice about our protein chip, and we hoped that we could have a better understanding of our project.

Current detection methods mainly consist of lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy and imaging method as described above. As she knows, it is generally not to rely on checking serum during clinical diagnosis, but through X-ray, endoscopy, pathology detection method or low-dose CT. Pathology detection equals to extract tissue samples from patients for testing, which is not the most accurate and commonly used method but a must before being confirming case. In addition, there exist other awesome but in-development methods such as extracting blood samples from patients and doing the whole-genome testing</SPAN><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">--a new cancer treatments. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">Also, there exists the detection of tumor markers for tumor detection. No matter tumor marker is tumor-specific or tumor-associated, the relationship between tumor marker and tumor's appearance is confusing, complex and indirect. Specifically, more than 500 tumor markers has been screened, the degree of correlation between tumor and marker can't be determined and we can only show that there is a possibility of suffering from cancer after detecting the markers. Nevertheless, multiple markers detection can improve the accuracy of tumor detection. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">What's more, the female oncologist assessed our project about the possibility and feasibility). She admitted that hydrophobin our project uses is able to better maker detection sensitivity and she ensured that the method can be applied to track the changes about concentration of some known tumor markers as an innovation, aiming at detecting whether patients are experiencing some of relapse warning signs and taking appropriate measures during early relapsing stage timely. Meanwhile, when using a small dose of serum samples to complete detection, it is easy to collect samples and alleviate patients' pain safely (feasibility assessment). In other words, it's demonstrated to a safe detection method for patients and an efficient and sensible means for doctors (risk assessment). It's believed that our idea will be put into practice one day when we heard about the news that a Stanford sophomore named Theranos has developed novel approaches for laboratory diagnostic tests using blood. Her company's blood-testing platform uses a few drops of blood obtained via a finger-stick rather than vials of blood obtained via traditional venipuncture, and utilizes microfluidics technology whose timeliness and high sensitivity is similar to our idea in some degree. Finally, we interviewed a few nurses in division of oncology, and we were impressive about the feeling they described, &quot;Every day is both horrible and precious&quot;.</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family:'Arial Unicode MS',sans-serif">The visit to General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University plays a crucial role in our human practice, and we are indebted to them all for their timely help.

Professor Sang, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, pointed out Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises lacked pharmaceutical innovation and investment in research and development, so Chinese new drug market was monopolized by large international companies. Then, Professor Marshall, the winner of Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 2005, told us his story about research and industrialization in Tianjin.

Still it is a good opportunity for being a part of team and overcoming some problems and trying to catch good results and performance make me happy and more willing to work in science.&quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;iGEM allows me to solve real-world problems using knowledge from classes, and has been a great way for me to gain comfort in a lab setting, insight about working on a team, and experience managing my own research project. It's been a very meaningful part of my life!&quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;It is a great opportunity to do real science in a real lab, to experience challenges that a real scientist faces and to get the experience of a real teamwork that has real consequences. &quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;This is my third year in iGEM. I am the team leader of this year's team. I take part in WetLab, P&amp;P, Modeling, wiki designing and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM Team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death , and it is also the only place where I feel as immortal as my love of science.&quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;iGEM is a real thrill. I think it is the first opportunity we have as sophomores to do real research including thinking of a research project and planning your own experiments. It's really a deep dive into synthetic biology but I think we can learn very very much from taking part in iGEM.&quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;The iGEM means to me much more than a competition. I am working with other students who share my interests and my illusion about making real our own idea. This is also a great opportunity to learn about things that typical subjects do not teach you or can't be studied. In conclusion, I feel like I am living a great experience, and I just hope to take with me as much as I can learn.&quot;</SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size: 19px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&quot;Routine in wet lab work, a view for how things work, how problems can be solved in the lab. Technical knowledge. More pronounced understanding of some biological mechanisms. Learned how to design plasmids and experiments. Get to see one project from beginning to end. team work. Interesting human practices experiences that you would never get otherwise. Contact to expertns and teams from other countries. VERY COOL, would always recommend.&quot;</SPAN></P></DIV><DIV id="content-in"><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Trans-regional Questionnaire</SPAN></STRONG></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In cooperation with other ten iGEM teams such as Beijing Institute of Technology and The Chinese University of Hong Kong University, we collected some issues of each team and posted a questionnaire in order to understand different people's views towards project-related issues in different regions of the world and make publicity for synthetic biology. (Questionnaire link)In the meanwhile, we added some questions to explore people's attitude toward plastic recycling around the world such as plastic classification and degradation. In conclusion, we received 473 pieces of reply, and a host of individuals think it is of significance to biodegrade plastic, nevertheless, more than three quarters of people we interviewed didn't concern about the legislations and regulations about plastic classification, recycling and reusing. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Obviously, the regional cooperation is able to know about opinions in other regions of the world and strengthen bilateral and multilateral communication and cooperation that establish an interactive and friendly bridge among iGEM teams. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><STRONG><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Meet Tsinghua-A and Nankai</SPAN></STRONG></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Tianjin iGEM established a profound friendship with Tsinghua-A and Nankai University a few years ago.

Firstly, we visited their laboratory, and observed some experimental operations. Then, we introduced our own project to each other and exchanged views of some practical problems in the experimental during the meeting. Meanwhile, iGEMers in both teams who were in charge of modeling discussed for a long time. Both of us harvest a lot from each other. In a word, the exchange activities enhanced our thoughts of project successfully.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.2em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV id="content-in"><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We became increasingly aware of the high costs containing experimental material cost, human practice activities spend and registration fee. Our lab was able to cover only a part of the budget. Thus, we hoped to make more and more people who are involved in the field of synthetic biology know our project and do our utmost to persuade them to sponsor us. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We got in touch with more than one hundred companies, most of which are biotechnology companies. (quite part of companies)We introduced the iGEM and our project to them and showed our sponsorship proposal. (Chinese Version) in order to make them interested in our team, sponsor fees and provide experimental materials, technology support. There were quite a few companies directly refusing us which made us very depressed at first. In addition, some experts in companies talked with us very friendly and put forward useful suggestions for us although they did not provide financial support. It's believed that collecting the opinions and suggestions of some officials helped us to improve our project, making it more meaningful. Fortunately, a few companies committed to the value of our project and wanted to support us. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-left: 9px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em;"><SPAN style="font-size:19px;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">During the event of looking for sponsorship, we not only obtained some sponsor fee from the society but made better promotion of iGEM and synthetic biology. Having listened to the opinions of the experts, we can better our project. Additionally, we also harvest a lot of experience and deepen our understanding of our project when going out of school and contacting with workers and experts.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
