We mixed 200ng of the target gene sequence-Thc_Cut1, which is synthesized by IDT Company, with 50ul ddH20, making the final concentration up to 4ng/μl. And then, we divided them into five eppendorf tubes equally. We confirmed the right of sequence of Thc_Cut1 by PCR.
We made sure that 58.8℃ is suitable for amplifying by the PCR of Thc_Cut1 which we have done. Next, we amplified the gene of Thc_Cut1, sJanus and its mutant sJanus-m by PCR. In this process, we didn’t do pre-experiment because of the experience of other groups. The temperature of PCR ranges from 55 centigrade to 65 centigrade. The following pictures of gel show that we got the target sequence successfully. (This is the standardized part.)
Today, we got the primers of inJanus and its mutant inJanus-m. In the experiment, we constructed a gradient of temperature, ranging from 55.7 centigrade to 63.0 centigrade to search for the best condition. The picture of them show that all of them is suitable, but the temperature of 56.9 is the best. And then, we make the target sequence recycled. (This is the standardized part.)
We linked the Thc_Cut1 with sJanus in the third step of overlap. The following picture shows the reagents we used and the exact amount we added in this system. The condition is the same to the process of our getting the gene of Thc_Cut1- sJanus-m. Using the method of PAGE, we found our target gene sequence and make them recycled.

After the process of pre-PCR, we put the forward and reverse primer to this system, each for 4μl, and then continued the PCR as usual.
We confirmed that the final gene sequence is right by PCR. In this process, we use the target sequence we got in above steps as the template DNA. And then, we added the primer and the reverse of Thc_Cut1, sJanus and sJanus-m in the PCR system. Using method of PAGE, we can confirmed that these two gene have been linked together correctly. The following picture shows the reagents we used and the exact amount we added in this system.

We used T4 DNA ligase to connect the gene coding Thc_Cut1- sJanus with the plasmid of pSB1C3. In this experiment, the amount of product is about 5 times of plasmid.

There are bacterial colony in the selective medium containing chloramphenicol. We selected three of them everyone, added into the tubes containing LB. And then, we incubated them in the shaker at the temperature of 37 centigrade overnight.
 When incubated overnight, we measured OD to judge whether the cells could be used to extract plasmid. We selected the suitable ones, and extracted the plasmid. And then, we used enzymes of Xba1 and Pst1 to digest some of them. The total volume of enzyme digest is 10μl. Using the method of PAGE, we know that the plasmid connected with Thc_Cut1- sJanus-m may be right. We sent our sample to company, using the technique of Solexa to check it.
We used the standardized gene as the template DNA to amplify the gene of expression. In this process, we also got the sequence of Thc_Cut1 which can be transferred and secret. The following picture of gel shows that we have got our target sequence successfully. The temperature of PCR is 60 centigrade.
We added 5μl of the bacterial containing the plasmid of pET28a(+) to 5mL of LB, which contains 5μl of ampicillin. And then, we incubated them at the shaker overnight.
 We exacted the plasmid and used enzymes of EcoR1 and Xho1 to digest it. In this process, the total volume of this system is 20μl. We also did the same to the target sequence and the total volume is 30μl. After finishing above all, we used gel electrophoresis to test and make the gene recycled.
 We connected the gene coding Thc_Cut1, Thc_Cut1- sJanus, Thc_Cut1- sJanus-m, Thc_Cut1- inJanus and Thc_Cut1- inJanus-m with plasmid of pET28a(+). The reagents and amount we used are same to above. The total volume of this system is 20μl. Finally, we transferred them into competent cells and incubated overnight.
 When incubated overnight, there are bacterial colonies in the selective medium contain ampicillin. We selected two of them and added into LB. Finally, we incubated them overnight. In this process, we can judge whether the plasmids we constructed are right by enzyme digesting.
