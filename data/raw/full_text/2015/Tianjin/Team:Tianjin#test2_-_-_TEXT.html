We are the first registration in iGEM 2015
3.12015
It is our first meeting for wet-lab group. During the winter vocation, everyone had designed his own project, which was ranging from environmental protection to protein degradation. And we chose our team member mainly according to their project. At this meeting, we defined our team¡¯s project from all those works. Our instructor Zefang Wang showed us its amazing applications.
3.82015
This is the first plenary meeting of our team. First, each of us introduced ourselves. Then, the team leaders described our team¡¯s current progress, future work arrangements and the personnel management solutions. They also described the laboratory safety exam arrangements. Finally, we took a group photo to mark the occasion.
3.142015
Everyone of wet-lab group talked about the general content of papers they had read. After that, through the discussion, we decided the next arrangement and the weekly regular meeting time. Then, the students of modelling group, wiki&design group and human-practice group conducted communication.
3.212015
A week ago, we divided the students of Wet lab into four groups, each group studied in different directions and everyone read an article which is different from others. The four directions including fusion protein, plastic degradation with hydrophobin, protein sensing chip, vegetable and fruit preservation with hydrophobin. Today, according to the papers we had seen, everyone shared the knowledge we had harvested with others. Then, the human-practice group showed us the arrangements of the fourth Crabapple Season, which is the biggest popularization of science in our school. The modelling group also showed us the knowledge they have learned. Finally, the wiki&design group showed us the original design of our team logo and ask us for some advice.
3.282015
First, the modelling group introduced the general idea of the experimental project model to us. As for the wet-lab group, we decided to make three research directions including fusion protein, plastic degradation with hydrophobin, protein sensing chip. In the past week, each group had searched for related papers and designed specific experimental process. At this meeting, we reported our preliminary experimental process to our teacher. The teacher pointed out our mistakes and shortcomings.

Science & Education Exhibition in Open Day
4.112015
The modelling group had designed a preliminary model about the plastic degradation experiment. Then, members of plastic degradation group communicate with them to improve the model. Each group of wet-lab showed us the improved experimental process, listed the reagents and instruments to be used in the experiment. The teacher gave us a lot of advice. The human-practice group summed up their process and written a summary of the fourth Crabapple Season.
4.182015
First, modelling group introduced their latest study progress. They also showed us some excellent web design. Afterwards, the wiki&design group showed us the original design of our team¡¯s wiki style and sought the views of us. After the meeting, the wet-lab group had a detailed discussion.
4.232015
Big change of stimulated plastic enzymolysis project
4.252015
Molecular cloning group: everyone has started to learn related knowledge and operation of molecular cloning from fellow students. They reported their learning process and the general content.  Presentation group: everyone has prepared an English speech which can choose any subject. Human Practice group: they report the situation of sponsorship.  Wiki&Design group: they showed us the latest design idea of our team¡¯s wiki.
5.32015
The first step of experiments
5.42015
Thy plastic degradation group have started to contact the companies to buy reagents. Human Practice group continued to contact the company for the sponsorship. Then the group leader has carried on the exchange with the teacher. As for the Presentation group, once again, everyone has prepared an English speech. The teacher suggested that they find the theme of speech which relevant the experimental project.
5.92015
First, each person of presentation group gave us a speech which relevant the hydrophobic. Then they rated each other from the following several aspects: body language, the spoken English and the content of the show.
5.162015
Just the same as last week, the presentation group gave us some wonderful speeches about hydrophobic. The Modelling group had made some good progress that they learned a lot of knowledge and they began to design model about plastic degradation. Through the communication with the plastic degradation group, we found that there are also some mistakes in the model, but the Modelling group would correct them in time. All of us believe that our team will be better and better.
5.172015
The first practice of presentation
5.232015
The Human Practice group made an approach to many firms for sponsorship. Several companies are interested in our projects, and we have further contact. After the end of this week, we wound not find new firms. At the same time, we have to start planning Human Practices activities, and put forward three or four different solutions. The molecular cloning team had planned to finish the standardization of the plasmid and the expression plasmid, but the experiment encountered some problems£¬the progress of the experiment needed to be delayed. The wiki group had collected some photos and other materials which is needed for the web pages The modeling group continues to study the use of all kinds of software, and to develop a reasonable modeling program
5.302015
Next week would be the last work week, we have to make adjustments according to the current progress. In principle, June 5th is the last meeting in the near future, the next meeting time is tentatively scheduled for July 12th. Each of the experimental group leader £¬each of wiki group member and the modeling group need to prepare a summary of the work which is carried out in the few months. The Human Practice group showed the connection of the human practice and the progress of the sponsor. The molecular cloning team must complete the standardization of plasmid before the summer holiday.
6.52015
The conference announced the preliminary plan of the holiday. The holidays may be arranged in August. We should take turns on vocation. Any personal reason, including practice, creating, research summer camp, travel, exam, are not allowed to leave, unless very special circumstances, but it will have punitive measures, such as arrangements to brush all tube, cleaning and so on, and may deduct vacation time. The specific arrangements need to be developed according to the experimental progress. The molecular cloning team shows the progress of the work in the form of PPT. The wiki group showed the construction of the site. They will be shown to be roughly. The presentation group divided the contents of the show into following parts: project design, experimental results, modeling, HP and others.

As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.
Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show great earnest and passion when he is doing experiments. And he could do management very well.
When Chenmao joined our team, he was just a freshman, but he had got unique insights about GMO. Although his major is EE, he is no worse than us in doing biological research. Science fiction is always his dish.
Heng is an enthusiastic boy who comes from a beautiful coastal city. His favorite sport is badminton, and our instructor Yang often plays it with him. He believes life is movement.
Junjie Zong is a humorous and lively boy, crazy about sports and Japanese comics. He says he has an inexplicable crush on biological lab…(Do you?)
Yuwei has a very active and open characteristic, sometimes like a boy. However, when she does experiments, she could show great patience and  carefulness. She loves others' praise, so everybody follow me and speak aloud- You are the apple of my eye.
Xuan is the only person praised by Shoujie as handsome. He is very keen on basketball and almost his every WeChat' moment is about it. In our team, he is Ketong's good partner in molecular cloning.
Yuchen describes himself as a talker, however, in our mind he is a singer, though I never get a chance to appreciate his singing. He is in charge of molecular cloning, at the same time he studies English hard every day.  2
Bowen is a graceful girl who is admired by us for her fluent and native English. In her spare time, she loves watching movies and reading books. Christopher Nolan and Scientific American are her favorites.
Junjie Yu is a junior student majoring in Chemical Engineering. He said why he joined us was that Ketong let him consider biological experiments interesting. Now he is in charge of the project of plastic degradation and could do molecular cloning very well.
Haofeng would love to talk with people, creating fun of  dreary experiments. He loves racing with others on agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. In daily life, his hobby is basketball.
Jinxin once said his life was forever about  losing something, looking for it and waiting for others to send it back. He is in charge of molecular cloning now, and he just lost some base pairs as sequencing showed…
As the only person who can paint and design, Qing is our team's treasure without doubt. Besides drawing, she is addicted to Japanese comic and games. Meanwhile, she is  Lionel Andrés Messi's great fan.
Programmers should always be respected, so as Shubin for our wiki. He could analyze web pages and photos with particular professional insights. By the way, Tianjin's hot summer really drives him crazy.
Yige is a senior girl who is always curious about the unexplored world and enjoys life very much . She loves climbing mountain and diving, which make her close to nature. By the way, she is really addicted to Sichuan cuisine, Taiwan snacks and pizza.
Xuemei has very infectious laughters and always brings sunshine to others. She loves jogging and watching variety shows. She is in charge of human practices and the project about protein chip.
Xiangyu is a lovely sophomore boy who brings laughters to our daily work with his own humor. He takes charge of modeling on enzymatic dynamics of cutinases in our team. And he will show his fluent English in Jamboree presentation.
There is a sentence on Hua's desktop-keep calm and love mathematics. Naturally she is a member of our modeling group, and she is thought to be their boss. Her major is chemical engineering, but she dreams to study applied math in the future. Best wishes to her!
Zexiang is a senior student majoring in Biological Engineering. He is crazy about genetic engineering, playing basketball and ping-pong. He takes charge of modeling on assembly of hydrophobins and enjoys it very much.
Yifan maybe our most mysterious member because nobody has seen him except Ketong. He devotes to our wiki's programming, which is his  hobby. Hoping he will show his talent here!
