ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
As the first modern university in China, Tianjin University has a history of 120 years. However, our School of Life Sciences is very young and fresh, which was founded in 2012. Though our college is so young, we have made many achievements owing to the great supports given by our university and the hard work of our professors and graduates.
This year is the first year when our school took part in the iGEM competition. The recruitment included all undergraduates in our university. After resume screening, audition and a tough winter vacation work which required candidates to submit a complete project design with protocols, 22 students were chosen as the members of team Tianjin 2015.
Our team consists of students majoring in life sciences, chemical/pharmaceutical/biological engineering, computer science, and even electric engineering. In particular, Yifan Zhang in computer science is from Zhejiang Sci-tech University. We are divided into four groups which are responsible for wet lab, wiki&design, modeling and human practice.
In our iGEM journey, our instructors always give us great help, and many graduates shared their experience with us. Since all of us are green hands in biological research, a small step for our project could be a gaint leap for ourselves. No matter what the result is, we have spent a happy and fulfilling time all together.
It is the second time for Ketong to take part in iGEM. And this year not many people would play jokes on him because he has become the team leader and usually shows his straight face. He doesn't like pretty loli anymore, but he still loves female.
Dongqi is another leader in our team. She is lazy in body but hardworking in mind. Larry in the book The Razor's Edge is her idol.
Jiashu is a gentle nice girl, and everyone is impressed with her warm smile. Meanwhile, she is often called Boss by Junjie Yu because she could conduct biological experiments perfectly.
Yang is a junior student majoring in Biology. He would show great earnest and passion when he is doing experiments. And he could do management very well.
When Chenmao joined our team, he was just a freshman, but he had got unique insights about GMO. Although his major is EE, he is no worse than us in doing biological research. Science fiction is always his dish.
Heng is an enthusiastic boy who comes from a beautiful coastal city. His favorite sport is badminton, and our instructor Yang often plays it with him. He believes life is movement.
Junjie Zong is a humorous and lively boy, crazy about sports and Japanese comics. He says he has an inexplicable crush on biological lab…(Do you?)
Yuwei has a very active and open characteristic, sometimes like a boy. However, when she does experiments, she could show great patience and  carefulness. She loves others' praise, so everybody follow me and speak aloud- You are the apple of my eye.
Xuan is the only person praised by Shoujie as handsome. He is very keen on basketball and almost his every WeChat' moment is about it. In our team, he is Ketong's good partner in molecular cloning.
Yuchen describes himself as a talker, however, in our mind he is a singer, though I never get a chance to appreciate his singing. He is in charge of molecular cloning, at the same time he studies English hard every day.  2
Bowen is a graceful girl who is admired by us for her fluent and native English. In her spare time, she loves watching movies and reading books. Christopher Nolan and Scientific American are her favorites.
Junjie Yu is a junior student majoring in Chemical Engineering. He said why he joined us was that Ketong let him consider biological experiments interesting. Now he is in charge of the project of plastic degradation and could do molecular cloning very well.
Haofeng would love to talk with people, creating fun of  dreary experiments. He loves racing with others on agarose gel electrophoresis experiments. In daily life, his hobby is basketball.
Jinxin once said his life was forever about  losing something, looking for it and waiting for others to send it back. He is in charge of molecular cloning now, and he just lost some base pairs as sequencing showed…
As the only person who can paint and design, Qing is our team's treasure without doubt. Besides drawing, she is addicted to Japanese comic and games. Meanwhile, she is  Lionel Andrés Messi's great fan.
Programmers should always be respected, so as Shubin for our wiki. He could analyze web pages and photos with particular professional insights. By the way, Tianjin's hot summer really drives him crazy.
Yige is a senior girl who is always curious about the unexplored world and enjoys life very much . She loves climbing mountain and diving, which make her close to nature. By the way, she is really addicted to Sichuan cuisine, Taiwan snacks and pizza.
Xuemei has very infectious laughters and always brings sunshine to others. She loves jogging and watching variety shows. She is in charge of human practices and the project about protein chip.
Xiangyu is a lovely sophomore boy who brings laughters to our daily work with his own humor. He takes charge of modeling on enzymatic dynamics of cutinases in our team. And he will show his fluent English in Jamboree presentation.
There is a sentence on Hua's desktop-keep calm and love mathematics. Naturally she is a member of our modeling group, and she is thought to be their boss. Her major is chemical engineering, but she dreams to study applied math in the future. Best wishes to her!
Zexiang is a senior student majoring in Biological Engineering. He is crazy about genetic engineering, playing basketball and ping-pong. He takes charge of modeling on assembly of hydrophobins and enjoys it very much.
Yifan maybe our most mysterious member because nobody has seen him except Ketong. He devotes to our wiki's programming, which is his  hobby. Hoping he will show his talent here!
