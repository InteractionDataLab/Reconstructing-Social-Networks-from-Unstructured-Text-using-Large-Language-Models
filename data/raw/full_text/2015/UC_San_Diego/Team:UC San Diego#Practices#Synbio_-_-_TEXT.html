synbio.UCSD is an academic organization established by the members of UC San Diegoâ€™s 2015 iGEM team dedicated to raising interest in synthetic biology both on the UC San Diego campus and among the local community.
The purpose of SynBio@UCSD is to:
1. Raise awareness of and drive interest in the field of synthetic biology.
2. Provide workshops to build the skillsets needed to be effective in synthetic biology.
3. Encourage interdisciplinary modes of thinking and collaboration.
4. Create an inclusive community for individuals of all biology-related interests.
5. Foster the growth and development of Open Source Biology.
Our goal is to ultimately expand the role of biology and establish a local and international community of collaborators. We have compiled emails of the listed iGEM teams from across the world, and we would like to invite anyone interested in synthetic biology to establish a SynBio organization at their school and set this international movement in motion.
