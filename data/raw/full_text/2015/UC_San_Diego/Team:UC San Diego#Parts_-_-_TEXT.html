List of Parts
The collection of parts described herein forms a modular platform to determine which of the enzymes of the fatty acid reductase complex is rate limiting. Each permutation of the complexâ€™s genes is compatible for coexpression with the luxAB construct. This methodology of stoichiometric expression can also be used to determine rate-limiting steps in other metabolic systems.
