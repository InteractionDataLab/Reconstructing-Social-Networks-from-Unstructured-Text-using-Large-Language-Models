WEEK 12
Modeling
>Reduced model as suggested by the work of D. Sekel and M. Iqbal in attempt to simulate in vivo behavior at steady state
>Began analysis of the different genetic constructs
Defined COBRA model in YPD media
>listed exchange reactions (reaction ids, reaction names) of both models in an excel document
>set bounds for inactive reactants to ‘0’
>less risk of noise and variation in fba.
WEEK 11
Wet Lab
+ Attempted Gibson assembly of AB fragments
+ Miniprepped CDE fragments
WEEK 11
Modeling
>Utilized model reduction strategies (i.e. quasi-steady state assumption, rapid equilibrium assumption, total quasi-steady state assumption etc.) in attempt to reduce our current model to one time-scale and cut the elapsed time for our simulations.
Decided to focus on identifying pathways essential to light production
>started writing script to capture the fluxes through every reaction while varying growth and light
>Troubleshooting: only one fba solution for growth and light (linear relationship)
WEEK 10
Wet Lab
+ Analyzed sequencing data to identify error-free clones
+ Designed primers for PacBio Sequencing
+ Amplified error-free clones for all fragments
WEEK 10
Modeling
>Finished code for the induction curve simulations and began generating preliminary results
