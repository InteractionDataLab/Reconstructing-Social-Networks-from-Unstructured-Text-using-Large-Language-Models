Project Description
For few years, influenza H7N9 has been a big threat for public health in China, yet traditional vaccination is not so efficient to it. In order to tackle this problem, our team investigated another approach to make an effective and promising cure for influenza H7N9. In our project, we clone HA,NA,M1 genes into a pCDNA5.1 FRT vector and co-transfect it into 293T cells to produce virus-like particles(VLPs). Then we purify VLPs by ultracentrifugation and inject into mice. Finally, we detect IgG by ELISA. Compared with traditional live attenuated vaccine and inactivated vaccine, H7N9 VLPs possess advantage in effectiveness towards the elderly and mass-production abilities. Plus, compared with previous VLPs made in expression systems such as E.coli and yeast, H7N9 VPLs are made mammalian cells. This can make VLPs be cut effectively, be formed into more natural conformations, and be increased in antigenicity and morphology.ã€Š/br>
