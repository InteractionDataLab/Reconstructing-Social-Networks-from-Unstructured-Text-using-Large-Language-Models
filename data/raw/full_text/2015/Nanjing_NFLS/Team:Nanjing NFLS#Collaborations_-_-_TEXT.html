Collaborations
We collaborate with Team NJU-China for help of part construction. Though we have achieved tangible results of antibody responses, the lab in the Center for Disease Control does not provide additional Biobrick parts construction due to the Chinese laws. Plus, we didnâ€™t receive the official kit until early September. So we turned to Team NJU-China for help. After the discussion about the project, we decided to use psb1c3 as the Biobrick assembly plasmid. In addition, they helped us to design and build the primer of our parts as follows:
Moreover, they let us use their facilities and labs for further experiments. Without them, Biobrick parts could never be constructed.
