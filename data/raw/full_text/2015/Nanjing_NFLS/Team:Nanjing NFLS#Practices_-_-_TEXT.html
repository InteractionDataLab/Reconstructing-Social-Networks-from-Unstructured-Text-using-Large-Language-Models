Human Practices
After some first-hand experiment in the Jiangsu Center for Disease Control, we do attain some knowledge about how a kind of vaccine is developed and the safety issues it should concern. With more investigation within the school and on the Internet, we found a lot of people, especially teenagers, do not have a clear picture about how exactly vaccine works and whether an individual should take one specific kind of vaccine. So we opened up a forum about common diseases and their vaccination in our school, NFLS(Nanjing Foreign Language School). During the forum, we not only introduced some well-known pandemic diseases but also more about what high-school students should do to prevent these diseases from happening on themselves and people around. From this topic, we shared our experience of collaborating with experts in Nanjing University and CDC, such as details and tips about how to extract specific DNA. By this, a lot of students got more interested in molecular biology experiments and iGEM, and we received a large amount of positive feedback from attendants.
