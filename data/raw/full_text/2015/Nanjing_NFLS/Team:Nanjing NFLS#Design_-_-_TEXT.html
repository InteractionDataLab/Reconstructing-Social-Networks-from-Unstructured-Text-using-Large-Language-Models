VLPs are essentially “hollow-core” virus particles formed by self-assembly of HA, NA, and M1. It is generally accepted that VLPs that retain the structure and antigenicity of the infectious virions may have a better immunogenicity and be more immune protective than recombinant HA. By immunization,three structural proteins may have a synergistic effect on the immune response. VLPs could also induce a broader immune response than a corresponding whole-virion vaccine and have a more dominant Th1 response than a recombinant HA vaccine in mice and ferrets. Research also proved that both HA and NA can stimulate protective immune responses including both humoral and cellular immunity in animals and humans. VLPsalsohavethepotentialforactivatingboththeendogenousandexogenousantigen pathways leading to the presentation of viral peptides by MHC class I and class II molecules. Particles,unlike single proteins, have the ability to bind and enter cells using appropriate surface receptors. VLPs can be processed and presented on MHC class I molecules, therefore promoting presentation to T-cells by professional antigen presenting cells. So in conclusion, our design of VLP does have a promising chance of becoming a revolutionary cure for influenza and maybe other diseases.
