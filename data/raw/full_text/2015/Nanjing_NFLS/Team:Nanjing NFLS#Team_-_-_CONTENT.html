From left to right:
My name is Qiaochu Guo. I am a current student of Nanjing Foreign Languages School and will graduate in 2016. I have a broad range of academic interests, including biology, physics, chemistry and management. I am especially interested in the intersection of biology and physics, such as electronic and molecular devices for health care and other purposes. In my free time, I also enjoy debate, cooking, watching and reading sci-fi.

I'm Yinuo Jin from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I'm seventeen years old and now ‎in Senior 3. I have some academic interests such as biology and history. In my excurricular time, I spend a lot of time reading biology books, watching related documentaries and going to laboratories to fulfill myself. Not only attending iGEM, I also took part in a research studying  taxonomy of arethusa. From these experiences, I found my academic passion and practiced my experimenting skills and I'm willing to continue studying biology in university. 

I’m Chen Xin, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign language school. 
Biology is the one of the school subjects I like most. I am often impressed by the organisms in which the working mechanism is precise and innovative. I spent a great amount of time reading those bulky books required for basic knowledge of biology. Though others may regard reading thick books as a dull way to learn, I find it rather interesting because it’s able to present me with a whole picture of the subject and then reveal specific details one by one. After mastering the knowledge needed, I was then able to figure out my own idea and then put it to practice.

My name is Xinran Han, a senior student in Nanjing Foreign Language School. Studying Biology for almost five years, I’ve developed a fascination in this field, as well as other relevant disciplines such as neuroscience. Apart from Biology, I also love physics, during whose courses I discovered my interest and passion to work in labs. In my leisure time, I like to study some programming and computer science knowledge, hoping that one day I can combine my computer science skills and principles in biology and cognitive science to dig deeper into the Artificial Intelligence field. 

My name is Weiyu DU and I’m from China. I always have great passion for robotics, engineering and neuroscience. As a girl, I specialize in control of mobile robots and programming. Since Grade 8, I have participated in a number of robotics competitions such as WER and FTC. In my first competition of robotics, I won the champion of Jiangsu Province. Moreover, our team ranked the 6th place and got into semi-finals in the 2015 FIRST Tech Challenge Asian-Pacific Invitational. Now I’m President of Robotics Club in my school and would like to pursue my dream as an excellent engineer in the future. Not only do I possess interest in robots but also in neuroscience. I find the mystery of brain and neurons fascinating and get most excited when it overlaps with robot engineering. I do seriously think that we could get inspiration from the communication between neurons and the delicate design of neuro system that could apply in the fields of engineering and communication. After all, everything’s possible as long as our imagination lasts.

Hi, my name is Jiaping Wang, and I come from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I have always thought that I am a science type person, because I am crazy about physics, attending numerous competitions and projects. Last year, I published a paper about superconductivity on Journals of Alloys and Compounds, but I am not satisfied with only sticking with physics, and that is why I join the igem. I just cannot help searching the truth beneath the common phenomenon.


I’m Juefei Kuang. I am the team captain of Nanjing_NFLS. I am big fan of experiments of all kinds, especially those with cool phenomena and mind-blowing ideas. In my spare time, I usually play ball games and video games with my friends and classmates. Igem is really a great opportunity for me because during the communication with experts and other iGEMers, I not only improved my academic ability but also enhanced friendships with so many cool people. 

I am Chunyang Xie from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I have a wide variety of interest, from humanities to science, and to art as well. Having done many research in Physics and taken part in Physics competitions in the past a few years, Biology to me is indeed a new thing. Reading news on recent achievements in Genics and Neural Biology, I expect Biology to have great impacts on our way of life in the next decades. That’s why I read extensively about Biology and accepted my friend Figo’s invitation to join this iGEM competition. I was very glad to find out that some of my knowledge in Physics and Mathematics in fact donated help to our study and experiments, for sciences are interconnected and share similar principles. This experience turned out to be inspiring too, not only in terms of subject knowledge but also in terms of team work and cooperation, which should serve as a good preparation for our future studies and careers.

I'm Yuqing Zhang from Nanjing Foreign Language School, senior 2. It would be my great pleasure to attend the igem competition with congenial youngsters this summer. In school, I not only shoulder the responsibility of biology' TA but also actively take part in numerous biological clubs, especially organizing the school project of Plant Tissue Cultivation. We arranged detailed experiments to discuss different nutrient profiles' effects on green vegetables and videoed the whole process, which was later presented on NFLS's official website. In my free time, I also attended several lab projects in university. The hot topics of golden rice and effects of transgenic food really inspired my great interest in this subject as well as strengthened my personal lab skills. During the preparation of igem, I did learn a lot about vaccine and spread out meaningful information to my surrounding family and friends who used to embrace kind of misconceptions. Those evidence mentioned prove my great passion toward igem, one of the most influential competitions for young people all over the world.

My name is Xu Chi. I am a senior from Nanjing Foreign Language School. Academically, my favorite subjects are Physics and Biology because I really love the feeling of discovering and doing experiments. Researching on topics of such scientific subjects is definitely what I always pursue for. Other than that, my biggest hobby is playing basketball. Furthermore, I’m the captain of the basketball team of my school and have led the team to win consecutive 2 regional championships in recent two years. I really appreciate the chance of Participating in iGem and I really learned a lot from this experience.

My name is Di Chen, a senior two student from Nanjing Foreign Language School.I am a science kind of person and I am really fascinated by the experiments and stuff. I love iGEM for it provides us with opportunities to cooperate with other people with more lab experience. I hope iGEM can become better year by year.

I am Tianci Hu and I am a senior student from NFLS in China.My hobby is to conduct experiments of all kinds, so I had fun during the iGEM journey. Though I don't have the chance to personally go to Boston, I really cherish this iGEM experience for it did improve my scientific study and lab skills.

My name is Yao Li, a senior student from NFLS. I am really interested in biology and my career preference is be to involved in biology experiments. This iGEM experience helps me to understand better of what a lab life is and what difficulties and chanllenges may I encounter in the future. I love my teammates and partners!

I am Yifei Shen, a senior student in NFLS. Though I wasn't really into the lab stuff, I attended the public forum and became a fan of iGEM. It is a such mind-blowing experience that I really widen my horizon through it! 
I’m Zhiyang Shi, and I am the main instructor of Nanjing_NFLS. I graduated with PhD from Nanjing Medical University in microbiology. I am currently in charge of the Jiangsu Center for Disease Control Virus Research Department. In addition, I’m responsible for the whole teams’ training and safety during the process.
I’m Zhibing Cao, the other instructor of Nanjing_NFLS. I am responsible for organizing the team and guaranteeing the safety.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
