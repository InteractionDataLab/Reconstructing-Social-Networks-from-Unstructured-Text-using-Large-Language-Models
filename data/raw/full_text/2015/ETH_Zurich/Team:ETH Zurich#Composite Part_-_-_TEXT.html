Composite Parts
In this section we present our composite parts. We expressed human Annexin V in Escherichia coli and then made a fusion protein with Annexin V and the Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) . The former was created to allow our bacteria to serve as detectors of apoptosis by specifically binding phosphatidylserine.
