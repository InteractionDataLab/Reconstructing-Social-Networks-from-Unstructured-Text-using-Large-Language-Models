"What I cannot create I do not understand."
- Richard Feynmann
Measurement
Note
In order to be considered for the Best Measurement Approach award , you must fill out this page.
There are a lot of exciting Parts in the Registry, but many Parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
Inspiration
You can look at what other teams did to get some inspiration!
Here are a few examples:
2014 Aachen
2014 Valencia Biocampus
