Basic Parts
In this section we present our basic parts. Our part is LldR, a protein required to regulate the lldR promoter. The expression of LldR was necessary to characterize the natural and our designed lldR promoters . We also give here an operon with LldP and LldR. LldP is an L-lactate permease which transports L-lactate inside the cell by proton motion force. It increases the levels of lactate inside the cell and it changes the behaviour of our designed promoters . We believe that our system combining LldR, LldP and PlldR can be used by future iGEM teams as means of lactate detection.
