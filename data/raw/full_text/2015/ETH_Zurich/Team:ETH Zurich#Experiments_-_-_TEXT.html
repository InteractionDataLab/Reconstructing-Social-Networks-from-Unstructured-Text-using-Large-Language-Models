Experiments & Protocols
In the course of our project we performed various experiments, ranging from construction and transformations of plasmids into E. coli over the testing of their functionality and response measurements after induction of our circuit, up to experiments with mammalian cells, which are the subjects of our analysis. In addition, we designed and tested a microfluidic setup for our final system
Below you can find the protocols for all our experiments, grouped into experiments with bacteria , mammalian cells , the combination of both , and some general useful basics .
E. coli experiments
Overview
The first important feature of our engineered E. coli is their binding capability to apoptotic cells via our INP-Annexin V construct which makes them display Annexin V on their outer membrane. We performed experiments to show expression , externalization , and functionality of this construct.
In our system, the actual detection of E. coli binding to apoptotic cancer cells happens via quorum sensing upon colocalisation of bound bacteria. We therefore designed experiments to test the quorum sensing properties of our final and working constructs.
The second signal which will be integrated by our bacteria is the elevated lactate production by cancer cells when compared to non-cancer cells. The main part of the lactate sensor we implemented in our system consists of synthetically designed promoters that is regulated by LldR and lactate, as well as by LacI. We characterized the sensitivity of these promoters to lactate and IPTG to find the best solution to fit our model with a good ON/OFF-ratio. Going one step further, we also probed our E. coli cells for their reaction to the actual lactate output of mammalian cells, the protocol of which you can find in the section of experiments combining mammalian cells with bacteria .
Antibody staining for Annexin V
To find out whether or not our INP-Annexin V construct leads to proper exposition of Annexin V on the outer membrane of our E. coli we performed an antibody assay where we stained the strains listed below with a primary antibody against Annexin V and YFP, respectively. Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy we would then detect binding of this antibody by staining with a secondary antibody (antimouse) which is coupled to Alexa488.
strain
expected staining?
INP-Annexin
yes
INP-Annexin + rfp
yes
INP-Annexin (high copy)
yes
Annexin
no
INP-YFP
yes
no construct
no
Table 1. Six strains were tested. We expect staining only for the strains expressing an INP-AnnexinV or INP-YFP construct, respectively, since without INP, Annexin should not be visible on the surface of our bacteria. Negative controls therefore include cells without any construct as well as cells expressing Annexin V but lacking INP. As a positive control we used an existing BioBrick (BBa_K523013) as well as our construct expressed on a high copy plasmid. One construct includes red fluorescent protein which will make it possible to probe our cells for colocalization of RFP and Alexa488, as well as colocalization of RFP-expressing E. coli with CTCs.

Phosphatidylserine-coated beads for verification of Annexin V functionality

Mammalian cell experiments
Overview
The detection of CTC with our engineered MicroBeacon bacteria relies on the detection of two cancer markers, susceptibility to sTRAIL and elevated lactate production by cancer cells. To reproduce literature data on these two points we performed several experiments with several mammalian cell lines, optimizing our protocols until we reached the most reliable results. We perormed all our experiments with Jurkat cells and 3T3 cells, representing a cancerogenic and non-cancerogenic cell line, respectively. We performed our experiments also for HL60 cells, another cancerogenic cell line, and also made some experience with HeLa cells. For more clarity, in our Results page we will however focus only on Jurkat and 3T3 since the other lines did not lead to significantly different results.
Below you can find the protocols we applied for measurements of lactate output of mammalian cells and their sTRAIL susceptibility.
Apoptosis susceptibility experiment with sTRAIL
sTRAIL is a sinaling molecule activating the TNF pathway in cancer cells, specifically inducing apoptosis in these cells, as opposed to the case of non-cancer cells which are not susceptible to sTRAIL [Srivastava 2001] . With the following experiment we are determining the optimal incubation time and sTRAIL concentration for induction of apoptosis in our cancer cell lines of interest.
Count cells and prepare a mastermix to have 80’000 cells or 600’000 cells per well for adherent and suspension cells, respectively. Prepare enough mastermix for all desired controls, concentrations, incubation periods, and replicates.
Distribute the cells into the wells of a 96-well plate, 200 µL per well.
Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to the start of the experiment.
Apply 5 µL of the desired dillutions of sTRAIL to the appropriate wells and incubate for 2 to 6 hours at 30ºC.
After incubation, separate cells from their medium (spin down suspension cells, remove medium from wells with adhesive cell.
Wash 3 times with DPBS.
For detection of apoptosis, Annexin V-Alexa488 can be used. It will bind to externalizes phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells.
Resuspend cells in Annexin binding buffer and add 5 µL per sample. Incubate at RT for 15 min.
Dillute Annexin V-Alexa488 by addition of 50 µL of Annexin binding buffer. Alternatively, engineered E. coli bacteria expressing our INP-Annexin V construct along with RFP (BBa_K1847015) can be used for detection.
Analyse cells by flow cytometry.
PI staining can be used to distinguish apoptotic from necrotic cells. Apply 5 µL of PI to the respective samples 5 min prior to analysis using flow cytometry.
Application of the appropriate positive controls (eg. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for Jurkat cells) and control staining (PI for necrotic cells) will lead to more detailed and reliable results.
Alternative induction of apoptosis using PMA
Susceptible cell lines can be incubated with PMA in appropriate incubation period and concentrations as a positive control to sTRAIL induced apoptosis. The following protocol is designed for Jurkat cells.
Incubate cells with 5 µg/mL PMA and 1 µM Ionomycin overnight.
Wash cells 3 times with DPBS and resuspend in Annexin V binding buffer for detection with Annexin V-Alexa488.
Measurement of the Lactate output of mammalian cell lines.
Our project relies on the phenomenon of elevated lactate output of cancer cells upon metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect . To validate this effect in our cell lines of interest we determined the lactate level of the cell’s culture medium after cell culture within the timeframe in which our system will be applied. Based on this, the lactate production by single cells can be estimated .
The experiment can be carried out in any volume of interest. We performed our measurement in 24-well plates.
Click here to see the results of this experiment.
Count cells and prepare a mastermix to have 80’000 cells or 600’000 cells per well for adherent and suspension cells, respectively. Prepare enough mastermix for all desired time points and replicates. Counting must be very accurate if the determination of the lactate output per cell is the aim of the experiment. Consider using a cell counter.
Distribute the cells into the wells of a 24-well plate, 500 µL  per well.
Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to the start of the experiment.
At the beginning of the measurement, the medium has to be exchanged to start at the minimal level. To this end, spin down the cells at 250 rcf for 3 min and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL  of fresh, prewarmed medium. The sample for time zero has to be taken right after the exchange of the medium.
Samples are collected in regular time intervals by transferring the medium into an Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge samples at 250 rcf for 3 min and transfer the cell free medium into a new Eppendorf tube.
Samples can be stored at 4 to 8 ºC for analysis at a later time point.
The lactate concentration of the collected samples can be determined using the L-Lactate Kit according to its instructions. In order to get good results with this kit, it is essential to use medium free of serum and phenol red.
Bacteria and mammalian cells
Overview
A rather uncommon thing in mammalian cell culture is the central part of our system: the coculture with bacteria. To anticipate unexpected side effects of such a coculture in our final setup, we performed initial experiments combining mammalian cells and E. coli. In a next step, we tested the funcionality of our engineered cells in respect to binding to apoptotic cells. The results we achieved from these tests were obtained applying the following protocols.
Coculture
Since it is a rather unusual experimental setup wanting to combine mammalian cells with bacteria, we performed preliminary tests to find out if anything undesired would happen if we mixed our bacteria with mammalian cells.
Introduce mammalian cells of interest into the wells of a 12-well plate. Adherent cells must be allowed to settle for 2 hours previous to any experiment.
Add 500 µL of a bacterial preculture to the mammalian cells. For analysis using microscopy it is best to use bacteria expressing a fluorophore.
Incubate for 4 hours. Do not incubate in a mammalian cell incubator to avoid contamination of neighbouring cultures!
Analyze samples using a microscope. Check for colocalization or possible internalization of bacteria by mammalian cells, as well as viability of mammalian cells with or without bacteria.
Binding assay
Our engineered bacteria are designed to bind to apoptotic mammalian cells. To verify this interaction we performed the following experiment.
Apoptosis can be induced in sTRAIL susceptible cells as described elsewhere using the optimal incubation time with sTRAIL using the optimal concentration of this agent.
Detection of apoptotic cells can be performed by applying 50 µL of INP-Annexin V and RFP expressing E. coli at an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8 to the samples followed by 30 min incubation.
Analyse samples by flow cytometry.
Variations of the conditions, for example incubation temperature or Calcium content of the buffer were adjusted to find the best setup. We found that incubation on ice at a Calcium concentration of 2.5 mM is optimal.
Chip
Overview
The final setup of our CTC-detection system will be a water in oil emulsion within a microfluidic chip. To approximate this environment in the limited amount of time we had, we invested a lot of thoughts into our Chip design . We were able to test some components of our final system in the nanowell plate that resulted from this design process. We used our test setup to investigate lactate detection by our bacteria in a single cell analysis setup.
Fabrication of the chip
The construction of a microfluidic chip relies on three steps:
Designing a transparency mask of the chip architecture.
Generating a negative mold of the chip on a Si-wafer using a negative photoresist and standard photolitography technique.
Cast PDMS over the produced mold to get a positive image of the chip.
Many thanks to the D-BSSE Clean Room facility for making the mold, and the Tay group PDMS room facility for making the chip for us.
Draw the design on Autocad software.
Order the transparency mask from CAD/Art Services, Inc
Use a negative photoresist (SU-8-3025 ) for mold making
Non-stick functionalize mold: first, place mold in closed wafer carrier box with a beaker containing a few drops of TMCS. Incubate for 15-60 minutes.
Prepare the PDMS: Mix 10:1 PDMS: Weigh in 66g base PDMS + 6.6g curing agent. Then mix and defoam PDMS in Thinky mixer (3 min at 2000 RPM mix + 3 min at 2200 RPM defoam).
Cast chips: Pour 30 g of the mixed PDMS over wafer in a glass petri dish, degas wafers in excitator for 60 minutes and place in oven on level surfaces. Cure 45 minutes at 80 °C
Finalize chips: Carefully chips from wafers and cut the chips into the desired shape.
Preparation of the chip for the experiments
Clean chip with adhesive tape to remove  all dust particles
Plasma treat chip for 50 s at 40% power in plasma machine (Diener FEMTO).
Submerse chip in double distilled H 2 O
Incubate the chip in Fibronectin solution (0.1 mg/mL) for at least one hour.
Wash chip with PBS (2 times).
Seed cells as explained in Loading of Mammalian cells and bacteria.
After chip usage, clean by incubation in 1M NaOH, no more than 5 minutes
Loading of Mammalian Cells and bacteria
To allow for single cell analysis, we need to reach the stage where most wells in our chip contain only one mammalian cell. We tried several techniques of administration of mammalian cells and bacteria to our chip. The optimal protocol proved to be:
Dilute the mammalian cells to a concentration of 15 cells/µL.
Load 3 mL of the cell suspension into the 6-well plate containing the chip.
Add bacteria to have a concentration of 15 cells/nL into the chip, after measuring the OD thanks to an OD600-bacterial density converter .
Mix the solution with a pipette carefully.
Let the cells adhere for 15 minutes.
Optionally, seal the chip with a coverslip.
Lactate sensing of cancer cells
As a prove that the lactate levels produced by cancer cells are enough to trigger GFP expression from our lldR-promoters, we introduced our bacteria into a nanowell plate, along with Jurkat cells. Fluorescence and  bacterial cell count were monitored using ImageJ and lead to data presented here .
Dilute the mammalian cells to a concentration of 15 cells/µL.
Load 3 mL of the cell suspension into the 6-well plate containing the chip.
Add bacteria to have a concentration of 15 cells/nL into the chip .
Mix the solution with a pipette carefully.
Let the cells adhere for 30 minutes.
Observe chip for 6 h using the we used an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti-Eclipse) with magnification 20X. We imaged the bright field and gfp fluorescence every 15 minutes.
