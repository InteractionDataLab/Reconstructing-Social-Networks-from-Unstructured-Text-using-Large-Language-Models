Bacterial strains and Mammalian Cell Lines
Escherichia coli TOP10
The bacterial strain we used as a base for all our transformations was TOP10 (Genotype: F- mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 nupG recA1 araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7697 galE15 galK16 rpsL(StrR) endA1 λ-). These cells were provided by the Panke Group at ETH Zurich.
Jurkat Cells
Immortalized human T lymphocyte cell line. We used this cell line as a model line for cancer cells with elevated lactate production and TRAIL susceptibility (papers). A big thank you to the Tay Group at ETH Zurich who kindly offered us an aliquot of their cells.
HL60
Cell line derived from acute myeloid leukemia. We used this cell line as a model line for cancer cells with elevated lactate production and TRAIL susceptibility (papers). Many thanks to the Neri Group at ETH Zurich who kindly offered us an aliquot of their cells.
SK-BR-3
HER2-positive breast cancer cell line. We used this cell line to validate the chimeric receptors of the Stockholm iGEM team. We are very grateful to Michal Stanczak from the University Hospital of Basel for offering us a sample of this cell line.
3T3
Murine fibroblast cell line. We used this cell line as a model line for healthy cells which are restistant to TRAIL and produce normal levels of lactate. Many thanks to the Tay Group at ETH Zurich who kindly offered us an aliquot of their cells.
3T3 P65 -/-
Murine fluorescent fibroblast cell line.
H2B-GFP: nuclear staining
P65- dsRed: cytoskeleton
We used this cell line to study the co-culture of the bacteria and the chip. Many thanks to the Tay Group at ETH Zurich who kindly offered us an aliquot of their cells.

Plasmid Purification
Product: ZR Plasmid Miniprep ™-Classic
Company: Zymo Research
Lot: ZRC182892
Catalog No: D4016
Changes to the protocol included an extra step to dry the column before elution and the use of water for elution instead of elution buffer. For elution of large plasmids we used prewarmed water.

Changes to the protocol included an extra step to dry the column before elution and the use of water for elution instead of elution buffer. For elution of large plasmids we used prewarmed water.
Lactate Detection Kit
Product: L-Lactic Acid
Company: Megazyme
Lot:
Catalog No:
Changes to the protocol included an extra step to dry the column before elution and the use of water for elution instead of elution buffer. For elution of large plasmids we used prewarmed water.
The detection of lactate using this kit relies on two enzymatic reactions. In the first, L-lactate and NAD&sup+; were converted into pyruvate and NADH+H&sup+; by L-lactate dehydrogenase. In the coupled reaction, pyruvate is used with D-glutamate by the D-glutamate-pyruvate transaminase to have the equilibrium of the first reaction in favour of the pyruvate. The concentration of  NADH is finally measured as the optical density at 340 nm (OD340).
