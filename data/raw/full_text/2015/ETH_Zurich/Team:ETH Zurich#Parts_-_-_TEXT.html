Parts
Many parts were required to complete our project. Some of these parts where used from the Registry , others were designed and cloned for this project. In the following section, we are presenting all parts we used , designed and characterized .
Overview of our genetic design.
BBa_K1847010 . Hybrid promoter that is responsive to both IPTG and lactate.
BBa_K2847008 . Promoter that shows an improved performance when compared to the natural PlldR
Our part collection
We designed a promoter library based on the wild-type PlldR ( BBa_K822000 ). You can check our results using this promoters here .
Regulatory system design

In this design, the spacing between the two operator sites was removed, and the Anderson promoter was placed in front of the operators ( BBa_J23117 )
BBa_K1847003
In this design, the spacing between the two operator sites was removed, and the Anderson promoter was placed in front of the operators ( BBa_J23118 )
BBa_K1847004
The original PlldR was substituted by Plac and lacO.
BBa_K1847010
The original PlldR was substituted by PlacUV5 and lacO.
BBa_K1847011
The original PlldR was substituted by a spacer and Plac and lacO were located in front of the promoter.
BBa_K1847012
Plac and lacO
BBa_K1847013
PlacUV5 and lacO
BBa_K1847014
Our new basic parts

Registry number
LldR
Sequence encoding the regulator protein LldR.
BBa_K1847001
LldP-LldR
Sequence encoding the L-lactate permease LldP and the regulator protein LldR.
BBa_K1847016
Synthetically designed hybrid promoter
Synthetic promoter inhibited by lactate and IPTG.
BBa_K1847010
Our new composite parts
Our composite parts are from used in binding system to E. coli. More information about our experiments on bacterial binding to mammalian cells can be found here .

Registry number
Annexin V
Promoter J23114-RBS B0034- Annexin V optimized for Escherichia coli
BBa_K1847000
INP-Annexin V
Promoter J23114-RBS B0034- INP-Annexin V fusion protein
BBa_K1847015
Newly characterized parts of the Registry
Here we present the parts from the Registry where we improved the existing characterization.
Part Name
Description
Registry Number
aiiA
Autoinducer inactivation enzyme aiiA (enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signal). Check out our characterization for aiiA !
BBa_C0160
pLldR
lldPRD operon promoter + RBS from E. coli. In the absence of L-lactate, lldR binds to two operator sites O1 and O2 in the promoter region and inhibits expression. Check out our characterization for pLldR ! We also improved the existing promoter by removing the ArcA site and obtained an increased ON/OFF ratio by changing the promoter strength.
BBa_K822000
