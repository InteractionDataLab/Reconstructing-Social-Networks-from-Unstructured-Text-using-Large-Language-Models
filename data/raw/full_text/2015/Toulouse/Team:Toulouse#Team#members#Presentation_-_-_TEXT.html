Our Team
Here is the place for you to get acquainted with our happy (api !?) team of ten students and our wonderful instructors ! Though we all study in Toulouse, we have different fields of expertise. In fact, six of us study Biochemical Engineering at INSA, while the others are in the first year of their Master’s degree at Paul Sabatier University, two in Microbiology and two in Bioinformatics.  The fact that our fields of study are varied is a great force for our team. It is only by using each member’s personal skills that we will be able to make ApiColi the greatest project. And moreover, in what matters, we are alike and share the same motivations as to our iGEM participation : our love of science and will to take part in the advancement of synthetic biology. We want to learn, again and again, and share through our first international experience.
