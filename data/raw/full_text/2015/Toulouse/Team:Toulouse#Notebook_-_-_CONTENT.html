During this period, we were informed by iGEM toulouse instructors of what this competition is, and what was expected of us.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subtitle" id="part2"><H3>From February to May</H3></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>02/02</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 First team meeting, our instructors informed us on the competition more specifically and how the team is organized. Our first mission was to prepare a presentation for the next week on the following themes:
 </P></DIV><DIV class="group"><DIV class="three_quarter"><UL style="font-size:15px;"><LI>Previous subjects. What are the themes explored by iGEM? Give examples of good projects and explain why they won?</LI><LI>Biobricks? What are they? What are their advantages? What are the materials sent by iGEM? How does the registry work?</LI><LI>Competition and deadlines. How does the competition works and what are the important deadlines?</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
Those presentations gave us the opportunity to understand more about the iGEM competition and to get to know each other (since we don’t all come from the same institutions). 
 </P></DIV><CENTER><P class="legend">Our first team meeting</P></CENTER><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 We also created our email address and a google drive to organise our files online.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>02/09</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 Every group of two or three students presented one of the subjects seen above. Every presentation was followed by a Q&amp;A. Thanks to it, everyone understood clearly the topic.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>02/16</H3></DIV><DIV class="group"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 The next step was to present every week, two new project ideas. The presentations were divided in the following parts.
</P></DIV><DIV class="group"><DIV class="three_quarter"><UL style="font-size:15px;"><LI>Context</LI><LI>Goal</LI><LI>Originality</LI><LI>Strategy</LI><LI>Difficulty</LI><LI>Modelling</LI><LI>Device</LI><LI>Benefit</LI><LI>Ethics</LI><LI>Planning</LI><LI>Why is this project going to win?</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Until May</H3><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
The following weeks were spent brainstorming. Everyone presented at least two project ideas. Here are few examples of projects reviewed:
</P></DIV><DIV class="group"><DIV class="three_quarter"><UL style="font-size:15px;"><LI>Creation of a quick detection kit of hepatitis</LI><LI>Degradation of Lignin</LI><LI>Use of ice nucleation proteins for water desalination</LI><LI>Creation of a small domestic pollution detector</LI><LI>...</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subtitle" id="part3"><H3>May</H3></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/04</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 Our youngest instructor and team mother Mathilde Béraud went with Benoît Pons to the FSIE committee, and thanks to their intervention, we obtained  € 4000 ! 
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/05</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 Two projects were still in course to be chosen, the use of ice nucleating proteins to purify water and the creation of a 
 bio trap against the parasitic mite <I>Varroa destructor</I>. This last one was chosen to be our project on the grounds that it 
 was the most feasible. Based on bibliography, the initial idea was to build an engineered bacteria which will have to produce butyrate to attract the parasite. The following weeks were the subject of extensive researches on the topic. 
 Moreover, it was time to choose attributions to make the project management easier, below in the table, the main assignments. </P></DIV><DIV class="group center"><TABLE class="result"><TBODY><TR><TH>Trouche Blandine</TH><TD>Finance</TD></TR><TR><TH>Tanchon Melany</TH><TD>Modelling</TD></TR><TR><TH>David Melissa</TH><TD>Events</TD></TR><TR><TH>Pons Benoit</TH><TD>Press</TD></TR><TR><TH>Etcheberry Thomas</TH><TD>Logistics</TD></TR><TR><TH>Le Scornet Alexandre</TH><TD>Registry, Biobricks</TD></TR><TR><TH>Pons Marine</TH><TD>Experiments</TD></TR><TR><TH>David Anthony</TH><TD>Power Point Presentation</TD></TR><TR><TH>Gody Louise</TH><TD>Wiki</TD></TR><TR><TH>Chaumont Laetitia</TH><TD>Ethics</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/13</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 Two members of our team participated in the Toulouse Exposciences. They presented a poster on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. They also organized banana DNA extraction experiences for children. This successful event was a good opportunity for us to start learning how to design a poster and to communicate about synthetic biology.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/15</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
We held our first meeting without instructors to discuss the design of the constructions needed to create the engineered bacteria. 
Our reflection led us to the conclusion that our construction should respect the bee life cycle. We therefore started searching for beekeepers 
that would agree to discuss with us.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/18</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">We met with Dr Boucher Christian HDR, DR1 INRA retired since 2012 and amateur beekeeper. 
 The fact that Dr Boucher was both a researcher and a beekeeper made this meeting really beneficial for us. 
 We learned every important stages in a bee life and how the varroa affected it. 
 We also learned more about the beekeeping activity and the treatments used to fight against the parasite. 
 Furthermore we have been able to discuss our early genetic design and how to improve it.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">The conclusion of this meeting was that 
 the bacteria should not produce both attractive and toxic molecules at the same time. These 
 productions should be cyclic to have the least effect on bees life cycle since formate is also toxic at a lesser extent for bees.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>05/25</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 During the whole week we searched for ways to produce our molecules cyclically. We chose to implement 
 a circadian rhythm cycle which would allow us to produce toxic molecules during the night when bees are a lot less active.
 We also convinced Louise Gody to create our logo because she is capable of drawing with talent using a graphical tablet.
We also started to organise our search for financial help. To do so we designed a booklet explaining our project and what iGEM is.</P></DIV><DIV class="subtitle" id="part4"><H3>June</H3></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/01</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
We first started searching for genes that we would like to have in our constructions on the iGEM registry.
After we successfully designed our construct we started thinking about what our device would look like. Since our bacteria needed to perceive red light we decided to place our device at the entry of the hive but outside.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/05</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
 We realised that our the cloning part would be quite long because of the number of genes needed to obtain... We therefore decided to order synthetic sequences for our synthetic pathway constructions.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/06</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
Laetitia Chaumont, Benoit Pons and Mathilde Beraud went to a laboratory studying varroa(Vacbio EA 4357). Dr. Vetillard allowed us to test the actual effects of different concentrations of butyrate on Varroa. The results were inconclusive. However two parameters had to be improved because butyrate is a very volatile molecule and we conducted experiments in a petri dish thus diffusion complicated the interpretation. Therefore, we decided to set up a more optimised protocol to assess the attraction of varroa by butyrate.
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/18</H3></DIV><DIV class="group"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
Louise Gody drew our amazing logo!! </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/22</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P align="justify" style="font-size:15px;">
We finished the design of our constructions and send it to our instructors for checking. In parallel we started training ourselves on basic synthetic biology protocols such as making competent cells, biobrick transformation…
 </P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>06/29</H3></DIV><UL align="justify" style="font-size:15px;"><LI> Modelling started.

 We designed a new protocol to assess whether butyrate is an attractive molecule for varroas. Thanks to M. Patrick Chekroun who made a T-tube in glass, we were able to define the attraction power of butyrate. <A target="_blank" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Toulouse/Experiments">See &quot;Protocols&quot; part</A></P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>07/02</H3></DIV><DIV class="group"><P align="left" style="font-size:15px;">
