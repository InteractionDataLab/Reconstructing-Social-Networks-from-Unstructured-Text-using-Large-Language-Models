Formate acaricide activity test
How to synthesize formate with E.coli?
Treating varroa
After having attracted and trapped varroa in a confined device at the hive entrance,  it is necessary to prevent it from escaping, and to eradicate it. It should be pointed out that beekeepers already use some treatments to fight against varroa, among them oxalate,  fluvalinate, thymol or formate. All these known treatments use high doses which are toxic  for bees and humans. On the other hand, varroa is developing resistance against these treatments,  making them ineffective [1]. In the list of the molecules mentioned above, formate has already prove its acaricide property [2],  and has the advantage  to be naturally synthesized by E.coli.   For this part, the project main goal is to synthesize formate at low concentration with the  bacteria during a short time period, in order to reduce doses and minimize the toxicity on bees.
Formate acaricide activity test
Before formate production by our strain, it was necessary    to check the "miticide" activity of the molecule with a specific test.    In this experiment, three varroas are placed in a Petri dish containing    a cotton soaked with 400 µL of formate at different concentrations (50µM, 500µM, 1mM et 10mM).
The experiment runs for 6h and varroa’s death is validated when it does not move anymore even    after a stimulus. The mite observation is realized with a binocular magnifier.

How to synthesize formate with E.coli?
Formate is a simple organic acid produced with an E.coli strain.  The initial substrate, glucose, is decomposed into pyruvate during  glycolysis, and formate is naturally synthesized thanks to two key  genes:
pflB coding for pyruvate formate lyase which catalyzes the cleavageog pyruvate into C1 and C2. This enzyme is sensitive to oxygen and is only active in microaerobic or anaerobic conditions, which is the case within our device [3].
pflA coding for pyruvate formate lyase activase, which is directly linked with the pyruvate formate lyase, enabling its activation [4].
Figure 3: Enzymatic reaction of the formate synthesis
The formate being naturally produced in E.coli, the key genes for synthesis  are over-expressed. The genetic construction is realized by assembling of these genes, which are placed under the control of P(Bla) constitutive promotor (BBa_I14018). Between genes there are ribosome binding sites (RBS)(BBa_B0030)  to improve protein expression, and a strong terminator (BBa_B1006) to end this construction which is finally cloned into a pSB1C3 vector.
