Our project to fight against the varroa mite has attracted a lot of attention: public and private institutions as well as beekeepers and supporting individuals.
We deeply thank all our sponsors for their financial and material contribution. Their unanimous support made this project a reality and more generally, they contributed to the promotion of science and research.
Our institutions
INSA Toulouse (National Institute for Applied Sciences) is a French public engineering school created in 1963. This famous pluridisciplinary school offers diverse formations such as biochemistry, informatics, physics, civil engineering...  At the moment, there are 2.369 engineering students, 262 teachers and researchers and 8 research laboratories associated to the school.
The Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier is a multidisciplinary University involved in sciences and technologies, sport, management and communication but also in the health field. This University was ranked in the 300 best universities in the world, according to the Shangaï ranking in 2014.
Our financial sponsors
The Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés (LISBP) was created in 2007 with the fusion of the Laboratory of Biotechnology and Bioprocesses and the Laboratory of Engineering in Environmental Processes. The LISBP is mostly specialized in innovative technologies relating to life and process sciences such as microbiology, biocatalysis and separation technics.
The Universitary Fundation of INSA Toulouse was created in 2007 and is an important vector of sponsoring enabling the development of innovating projects in the school. This contributes to the overall fulfillment of the engineer students.
The Université Fédérale Toulouse Midi Pyrénées gathers several establishments of higher education and research of the Midi Pyrénées region.
The cluster of research and higher education “Université de Toulouse” created in 2007 associates skills in complementary and diversified fields such as materials and life science, human and social sciences and engineering.
The Genopole of Toulouse (GenoToul) was created in 1999 to develop genome research, bioinformatics and to promote innovation by encouraging interdisciplinary projects. GenoToul manages about fifty projects a year covering various fields such as healthcare, agronomy, biotechnologies, ecology and environment.
Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB) is a French infrastructure developing new technologies relating to sustainable production by enhancing the use of renewable carbon source. TWB has three main missions: promoting the white biotechnologies, improving the scientific innovation and binding the fundamental research and the industrial world. (As a reminder, white biotechnology is the use of cells and enzymes to create industrial products.)
Adisseo is a worldwide expert in animal nutrition. This branch has a major role in the improvement of the food chain while preserving animals, the environment and human beings.
The Direction Régionale de l’Alimentation de l’Agriculture et de la Forêt (DRAAF) of Midi-Pyrénées depends from the French governement (Ministère de l’agriculture, de l’agroalimentaire et de la Forêt). Among its assignments, DRAAF supports the French agriculture, coordinates sanitary controls, and is part of the national agroecological project.
The Division de la Vie Etudiante has several goals. It supports the associative and cultural development in the University Paul Sabatier, but also student projects such as ours. Moreover, it welcomes, informs, and socially helps students.
The MIAT research unit (Unité de Mathématiques et Informatiques Appliquées de Toulouse) means Unit of Applied Mathematics and Informatics of Toulouse. Its scientific mission is to develop and implement mathematic and/or informatic strategies to model the data. These data are related with the life sciences (biology, agronomy, ecology and environmental sciences) in order to accelerate exploring research in silico.
The Embassy of France in the United States of America supports French teams participating in American life sciences competitions such as the iGEM competition. This grant "Life Sciences: inventing – creating – having fun" exists since 2012 and contributes to finance French researchers.
Solvay group was created in Belgium, 150 years ago, in 1863. Nowadays, the group has 1700 collaborators and is the global leader of the chemical field.
Beeopic is a French company managed by Nicolas Géant that assists beekeepers by advising them and offering them trainings. Moreover, the company sells and provides bee-keeping equipment such as hives, queen bees, swarms etc…
Beeopic also rents or sells and installs beehives in companies in order to help protect the bees.
Un toit pour les abeilles (A roof for the bees) gives individuals and companies the possibility to "offer a roof" and a beekeeper to all orphan bees. This is done in order to restore the balance necessary to the bees’ survival and to our survival. In exchange, the owners receive honeypots from their beehives. Companies have the possibility to install their own beehive on the roof of their building.
Our material sponsors
Metatoul: centre of expertise in metabolomics and fluxomics.
Metatoul is the metabolomics and fluxomics platform of Toulouse. It gathers skills (researchers, engineers, technicians) and technical means (heavy equipments such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Mass Spectrometry (MS)) for the global metabolism analysis.
Metatoul makes concepts, tools and methods linked to the analysis of the metabolism available to the scientific community.
Bio Basic Group is a privately owned biotechnology company. The company has a wide variety of Life Science Products available to best serve researchers in the field of Life Sciences.
New England Biolabs is a private company since 1974 and is the world leader in the production and sale of reagents in the Life Sciences and Biotechnology fields.
Qiagen is a biotechnologiy company that helped us by providing us with some lab kits.
Qiagen was created in 1984 and is nowadays a leader of the innovative market and technology by creating assay technologies that grant access to content from any biological sample. The main purpose is to help achieve success and major breakthroughs in Life Sciences. Qiagen offers a broad range of 500 products for over 500, 000 customers worldwide.
Mitsui Chemicals is a Japanese company in the chemistry field and mainly trades in performance materials, petro and basic chemicals and functional polymeric materials. Created in 1997, it is part of the Mitsui group and has around 13 000 employees in the world.
Air France, created in 1933, is the main French airline company. Its major activities are the transport of passengers, freight, as well as maintenance and servicing of planes.
The company takes part in the private group Air France - KLM and is also a founding member of the SkyTeam union.
ICKO is the European leader in beekeeping material selling. Their goal is to focus their products on eco-friendliness, and to offer a wide range of references in order to help beekeepers optimize and improve their production while respecting the environment.
Communication help
Bros communication is a young and dynamic company created in 2008 by the two brothers Baptiste and Julien Laurent. The main activities of the company are artistic direction, studio creation, public and corporate event direction, interior design, engineering and project coordination.
To make our project come true, we created an account on Ulule, which is the first European crowdfunding website. We presented our project to the general public in order to collect enough funds to have the opportunity to go to the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Indeed, the set objective of €1,200 corresponded to the plane tickets fee for two of our team members. We are proud to say that we had 59 contributors and collected €1,780 !
Big thanks from all our team to:
