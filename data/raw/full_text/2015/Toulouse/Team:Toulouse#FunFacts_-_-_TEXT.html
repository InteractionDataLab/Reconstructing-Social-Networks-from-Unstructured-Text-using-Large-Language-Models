Fun Facts
10 students in a lab during the whole summer
What could possibly go wrong?
Aerodynamically, the bumble bee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumble bee doesn't know it so it goes on flying anyway.
Technically, this project was too long to complete, but the Toulouse iGEM team didn't know it so they did it anyway.
During our summer at iGEM, we often impersonated movie characters or recreated famous scenes from TV shows - sometimes on purpose, sometimes not. Here are a few of our best cosplays !
Ya'll ready for iGEM? Arrrr !
CSI : Toulouse
It's a trap !
Theoden and Grima Worm-Tongue (or Charlemagne and Quasimodo, depending on the sources !)
“Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”
At the beginning of the project, we went to a park to take some pictures that we later used for our communication. There was a playground in that park, so we could not resist the temptation to use the toys and take a few pictures !
When we realize that we have been doing our competent cells wrong for 2 weeks
When we tell our instructor that we failed our competent cells
With some slowly growing strains of bacteria, we often had difficulties to spot the colonies, even after an overnight incubation. As we were eager to check the results of our cloning, everybody checked every plate with different ways to look at it !
To be lucky in our wet lab work and wiki coding, we built two glove-gods: ATGC for molecular biology and html for informatics ! (Their main inconvenient being that gloves deflate rather quickly)
After spending countless hours in the lab during almost four months, our president, Marine, has found a way to make herself at home !
"That's MY spot !"
"It's not messy, I can find everything in there !"
We found several old LB medium in the lab, but this was the most beautiful specimen of fungus contamination we saw !
"Omelette du fungus"
But first, let me take a selfie !
♪ Because I’m Api ♫
We received a few packages containing dry ice, and we had a lot of fun with it ! Here, you can see a soap buble filled with carbon dioxyde smoke.
"And of course, drrrrry ice"
Mathilde's face when she had to cope with our puns and jokes !
Louis Pasteur would be proud of us !
This wiki went through a lot of weird phases.
Wiki Freeze at last ! We look fine.
