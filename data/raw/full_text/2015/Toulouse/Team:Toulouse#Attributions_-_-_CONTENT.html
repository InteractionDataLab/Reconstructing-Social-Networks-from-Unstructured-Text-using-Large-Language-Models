The iGEM competition is an enriching experience in our student life, and thanks to this competition we gained a lot of important skills. 
As we needed to find sponsors we became experts in phone harassment. We also needed to communicate about our project and learned to make visiting cards, newsletters. We also became experts at explaining our project and synthetic biology to the general public. Moreover we had to get in touch with different people such as administrators, scientists, beekeepers, specialists, an ethical expert and other iGEM teams and learned a lot through these interactions. 	

In this part, we want to thank all the persons who contributed to our project by sharing their experience, their knowledge, and their interest.

Our thanks to: 
M. <B>Brice Enjalbert</B> for leading the project, for his advice and his availability. <B>All our advisors</B> who helped us develop our ideas during the brainstorming, and volunteered their knowledge of synthetic biology, microbiology... 
The <B>LISBP</B> that gave us full access to the lab and the material we needed, allowing us to work under very good conditions all through the summer. <B>Our sponsors</B>, for the financial support that enabled us to give reality to our project. 
M. <B>Thierry Dufresne</B> (Observatoire Français d’Apidologie), and M. <B>Yves Leconte</B> (INRA Avignon) for all their references in the field of beekeeping, bees and varroas. 
M. <B>Vincent Grégoire-Delory</B>, Mrs <B>Anne Cambon-Thomsen</B> and <B>Simon Desbois</B> who were with us throughout our ethical thinking process and thus helped us build the foundations of our project.

A special thank to <B>Pierrick Montagne</B>, <B>Gilles Truan</B> and <B>Théo Depresle</B> for their beautiful pictures, your skill in capturing moments are amazing.

To implement our project, we needed to understand the functioning of a beehive and the bees behaviour. <B>Christian Boucher</B> is a researcher from a famous French lab and has some beehives. He agreed to meet us and was able to inform us about bees and to advise us on the molecular biology part of our project. He was a helpful link between bees and biology, and we thank him for his availability. 
We owe M. <B>Gilles Truan</B> our deepest gratitude for his availability, and his unreserved support on synthetic biology and genetic regulation. 
To analyse the supernatant of our cultures (and particularly to try to detect our compounds of interest), we used the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) of the <B>Metatoul platform</B>. We would like to thank them warmly for making this state-of-the-art technology available to us. 
Also thanks to Mrs <B>Lindsay Peyriga</B>, who showed our team members how to correctly prepare NMR samples, how to run acquisitions and helped them with the interpretation of the results.

We based part of our strategy on the demonstration made in the <B>US8647615 patent</B> that butyric acid has an attractant power towards varroas. We thus decided to design the butyrate production pathway for our attraction module, and we acknowledge that this disables us from commercializing our project.
To design the butyrate production pathway, we met with M. <B>Philippe Soucaille</B>, teacher at the engineering school INSA and researcher who shared his experience in metabolic engineering.
Special thanks to Mrs <B>Angélique Vétillard</B> and her PhD student <B>Vincent Piou</B> from the laboratory Vacbio EA 4357 linked to the University Jean François Champollion for their warm welcome in their lab to experiment varroa attraction and eradication. 
M. <B>Patrick Chekroun</B> for the realization of the T-tube test we designed to experiment varroa attraction at the Vacbio laboratory.

To design the eradication module of our genetic system, we met with Mrs <B>Nathalie Gorret</B> who gave us interesting information about <I>pflA</I> and <I>pflB</I> genes. Moreover, we wanted our bacteria to survive during two weeks but did not know how to proceed. Mrs Gorret was the one who first talked to us about the <B>BioSilta kit</B>. 
</P></DIV><CENTER><DIV class="subtitle"><H3>Regulation support</H3></DIV></CENTER><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Our regulation module contains Cph8 and PCB receptors. We received the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) from <B>Clark Lagarias</B> and following the indications of <B>Christopher Voigt laboratory</B>, we received the strain containing those receptors from Dr <B>Nico Claasens</B> (Wageningen University). Thank you very much for allowing us to develop our module.

The creation of our trap would not have been possible without: <B>Benoît Pons</B> who designed the trap. 
M. <B>Valentin Girin</B> who created the trap on Catia software. 
M. <B>Philippe Seitier</B> from Mechanical Department of INSA who printed our trap with a 3D printer. <B>The technician</B> who created a little hive entrance to show the trap in its natural environment.
Our trap contains a TPX bag  that prevents bacteria from going out. This special plastic was given by <B>Mitsui Chemicals</B> and the idea came from the project of <B>Groenigen iGEM team</B> in 2012.

</P></DIV><CENTER><DIV class="title" id="part9"><H3>Thanks and acknowledgements to all the other people who dedicated some time in order to make our iGEM experience a great one</H3></DIV></CENTER><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
We thank everyone who has contributed in some way to the project, thanks for the help and encouragement that made our project an unforgettable adventure. 
Finally, we would like to acknowledge all of our team members: Laetitia Chaumont, Anthony David Mélissa David, Thomas Etcheberry, Louise Gody, Alexandre Le Scornet, Benoît Pons, Marine Pons, Mélany Tanchon, and Blandine Trouche. We worked hard on our wonderful project during all summer and we successfully created a very good atmosphere!
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Laetitia Chaumont</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Laetitia is the strong link of the team. She first came up with the wonderful idea of this project because her mother experiences troubles with varroas. She is able to take on impressive quantities of work and stay effective. Thanks to her, we studied bacterial growth, NMR analysis, in silico modeling, cloning… everything! Moreover, she is one of the main members responsible for the ethics part of the project, which gives it a real asset.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Anthony David</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Anthony is the pastry chef of the team. Besides his cooking skills, he designed all the biobricks sequences: gene optimization, and Serial Cloner software were his friends for many days. During our wet lab period, when we needed any help, he was always ready to assist. He created the wonderful PowerPoint presentation you will see in Boston… so do not hesitate to come take a look at our presentation, because it’s a real treat for the eye!
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Mélissa David</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Mélissa played a big part in making this project possible: she is often glued to her laptop or phone to contact sponsors or realize quotes about the goodies we will have in our stand. She is responsible for all the events we took and will take part in, and she represented us at International ExpoSciences. Finally, she teamed up with Alexandre on the parts submission, helping him with the PCR.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Thomas Etcheberry</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Thomas is our humoristic koala, responsible for the good mood in the team. He has some ability with the English language, that’s why he took care of the international communication. He found great prices for the flight and a place to live in Boston. In the wet lab, he was very busy but he was particularly dedicated to perform butyrate cloning and study. Then, he was a strong support for Wiki coding when our IT expert was sick or absent !
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Louise Gody</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Louise, our artist and wiki master… Without her, we could never have had this amazing logo, nor all these illustrations that you can see on our wiki, poster and presentation. With her massive work, she made the science more attractive and above all unique. In the wiki, she is responsible for the architecture, design, and simplicity. Even if she spends a lot of time on her computer, she does not forget the experiments.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Alexandre Le Scornet</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Alexandre is the coffee addict: he is the first to arrive in the morning, to turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet and… the coffee-maker. He can do all kinds of stuff, either in the wet lab or on his laptop. He realized a collaboration with the Eindhoven team, but his biggest work was with our biobricks. Indeed, he is the part submission responsible, and took care of the biobricks validity. He filled the register and sent all the parts to iGEM. If you want to see him, he will present our project during the Giant Jamboree.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Benoît Pons</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Benoît is the youngest of the team, and is partner in crime with Thomas on the bad jokes. He is a jack of all trades in the lab: autoclave, mediums, cloning, culture… they hold no secrets to him. Besides his hyperactivity, he took care of all the communication, being the link between the press and us. Moreover he is a great speaker, and will present our project in Boston with Alexandre and Blandine.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Marine Pons</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Marine is our mister freeze addict. She is the iGEM association president, but mostly a great scientist with strong knowledge in bacterial genetics: she is the leader for the wet lab, managing all the experiments to do. She has huge responsibilities and leads this project with skill. She had the idea to use a circadian regulation and designed all the genetic regulation of ApiColi.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Mélany Tanchon</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Melany is our bioinformatics specialist, author of all the modeling done in this project. Without this real asset, we could not compare experimental results with theory, and have an idea of its feasibility. She developed a modeling collaboration with Leuven team, but also created our wiki with Louise. Finally she teamed up with Thomas to clone on the butyrate pathway.
</P></DIV><DIV class="subsubtitle"><H3>Blandine Trouche</H3></DIV><DIV class="group center"><P class="text">
Blandine is an essential member of the team because of her role: indeed, she is the iGEM treasurer and manages our finances which are limited. She gave her help where it was needed in the experiments, she also realized a collaboration with Ankara team and was our very own French/English  translator and reviewer. She represented us during the meetup France in Bordeaux, and will continue to defend the project in Boston, presenting it alongside Alexandre and Benoît.
