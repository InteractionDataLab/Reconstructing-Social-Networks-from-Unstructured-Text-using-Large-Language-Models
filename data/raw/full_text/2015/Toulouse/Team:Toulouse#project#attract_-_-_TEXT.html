How to Attract
Butyrate attraction test
How to produce butyrate with E.Coli
About varroasis
Varroasis occurs with the varroa entrance in the hive, carried by  infected bees:  the mite can begin its parasitism and attack the brood. When the queen  gives birth to new larvaes in honeycombs, the fertilized adult female varroa mite  will come into  it before capping, and lay her eggs. The larvaes will develop,  increasing the overall  infection that affects bee population [1]. To tackle this issue,  it is necessary to attract  varroa carried by honeybees before they come into the hive.

How to attract varroa
Just before capping, bee larvaes produce a wide range of molecules, those molecules warn the mite about the upcoming capping and motivate  it to enter the cell [2].   Of all these molecule, scientific studies have shown that one can  significantly attract varroa: butyrate [3].
Butyrate is a volatile acid which is non-toxic for honeybees     nor the human being, because it is already present at physiologic     concentrations in the digestive tract. Moreover this molecule     is naturally     produced by some bacterial strains like Clostridium,     which is an asset     for this synthetic biology project [4].
Therefore we decided to     modify Apicoli     so it will synthesize    butyrate in order to attract varroa.

Figure 3: Butyrate attraction test using     T tube, with varroa mite in the middle
To check adequacy and relevance of this study (Figure 2),  an experiment using a T-tube has been developed (Figure 3).  In the first branch, there is a cotton soaked with 50 µL of water,  in the second a cotton with  50 µL of butyrate at 4%, and finally the  last one contains the varroa.
The butyrate being very volatile, our  system  used a pump to renew air, producing a concentration gradient.
How to produce butyrate with E.coli?
In this project, an Escherichia coli strain is used for its known   simplicity of genetic manipulation and its adequacy with butyrate   synthesis. Indeed, among the five enzymes of the butyrate pathway,   two enzymes are naturally produced by the bacteria. The following   engineered butyrate pathway has been designed:
Figure 4: Engineered butyrate pathway
The initial substrate is glucose which is decomposed into   acetyl-CoA during glycolysis. Finally, butyrate pathway   begin with acetyl-CoA: five genes are required with two  homologous and three heterologous genes.

ccr present in Streptomyces collinus coding   for crotonyl-CoA reductase,   an oxidoreductase acting on   CH=CH double bond. This enzyme    is also in C.acetobutylicum with bcd gene coding for butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase,   with the disadvantage   to run with Electron Transfer   Flavoprotein (ETF) which complicates the reaction [6].
