Here is the place for you to get acquainted with our happy (api?) team of ten students and our wonderful instructors! Though we all study in Toulouse, we have different fields of expertise. Six of us study Biochemical Engineering at the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) of Toulouse, while the others are in the first year of their Master’s degree at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse, two in Microbiology and two in Bioinformatics.  This variety in our fields of study is a great force of our team.  And moreover, in what matters, we share the same motivations concerning our iGEM participation : our love for science and our strong commitment to take part in the advancement of synthetic biology. We want to learn, again and again, and share, through our first international experience.
