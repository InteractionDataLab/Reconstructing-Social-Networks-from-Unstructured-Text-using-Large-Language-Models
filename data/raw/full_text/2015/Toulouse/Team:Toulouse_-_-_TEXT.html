"Beware varroa: Apicoli is guarding the beehive!"
Easter egg
Apis mellifera, the most efficient and widespread honey producing species, is heavily affected by the mite Varroa destructor.  This pathogen is actually one of the most important cause of death for domestic bees. Indeed, according to beekeepers, up to 50% of  the swarms can be lost every year because of this parasite, causing tremendous economic damages.

Our team is committed to preserving honeybees by limiting infection of beehives by these mites.  The aim of our project is to create a bacterium able to bait and eliminate the parasite using the  Synthetic Biology tools and philosophy. The engineered bacterium, named ApiColi, will be safely placed in a trap and will express alternatively an attractant molecule and a poison for the Varroa destructor, in agreement with the honeybee life cycle. Our trap will be sealed to avoid any contact of the microorganism with the bees and the environment. We hope that our concept will help to reduce the decrease in bee populations and its disastrous consequences.

Gold medal
Innovative human practices:
- Active participating in ExpoScience international in Brussels and future exciting perspectives
- Our project is based on a deep Ethical reflection
- Discussions with beekeepers to fit the best with real issue
- Communication in Junior high school
Collaborations:
- Modelling with KU Leuven team: they helped us with a diffusion modeling and we model metabolites production for them
- Survey with METU HS Ankara team: they worked on varroas too, so we exchanged data from our respective country on varroas infestation
