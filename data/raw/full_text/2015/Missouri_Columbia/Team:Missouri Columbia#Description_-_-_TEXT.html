Project Description
In a nutshell, we are going to attempt get E.Coli to make a pit viper anti-venom. Currently, anti-venoms are made by immunizing horses with snake venom over a period of years. What we are doing is looking at a snake's (lachesis muta) own resistance to its venom. We are going to engineer E.Coli in such a way that some produce Phospholipase A2 (one of the venom's toxic components) and the others produce beta-Phospholipase Inhibitor (the inhibitor against the toxic component). We will then see if the inhibitor can act on the phospholipase, and from there try and suggest a therapeutic effect through more trials and experiments. Then, if we have time, further research could be done to see if  we can find other lethal enzymes in the venom and counteract them with their associated inhibitors. Ideally, one could make a "cocktail" of these inhibitors that could be administered as a venom treatment.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
