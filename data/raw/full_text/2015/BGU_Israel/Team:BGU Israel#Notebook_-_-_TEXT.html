No colonies found on any of the plates from yesterday.
We think maybe there is a problem with the master-AAV. So we decided to try master-AAV from 2 dates: 19.08 and 16.08 for today's ligations:
Ligation of master-AAV (vector) with pSurvivin-mCherry (insert). (master-AAV from 19.08).

22.08.15
In the lab today: Shoham
We performed midiprep for pRC. Nanodrop concentration results were 3745ng/μl (1.81/2.24).

23.08.15
In the lab today: Vlad, Shalev
Since no colonies found on any of the plates in 21.08, we do DNA restrictions again.
Restriction of master-AAV, pSurvivin-mCherry with SalI and PacI. Incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C. Alkaline phosphatase was added to master-AAV.
We ran restriction products on 1% Agarose gel.
Gel result indicates that master-AAV restriction didn't work as expected. Maybe master-AAV eppendorf is contaminated. So master-AAV from                     original stock was transformed into DH5α and inserted into 10ml of LB (+ampicillin) ON.
pSurvivin-mCherry gel results are OK.
Meanwhile, we decided to try ligation with current master-AAV. So both master-AAV and pSurvivin-mCherry extracted from gel.
Since it didn't work so far, we tried to improvise with the ligation protocol. Instead of 50ng of vector, we took 100ng. Instead of 150ng of insert,                     we took 400ng. So the vector/insert ratio was changed from 1:3 to 1:4.
Ligation of master-AAV (vector) with dCas9-vp64 (insert).
Ligation of master-AAV (vector) with SaCas9 (insert).
After ligation, products were transformed into DH5α and seeded on LB agar plates with ampicillin ON. We also made a change in transformation                     protocol - instead of 10 minutes in ice, we left the DH5α for 40 minutes in the ice.

Two components of knockout system, constitutive promoters:
CMV-SaCas9-pAAV, U6-gUBB-pAAV
Controls: phTERT-eGFP-pAAV, pSurvivin-mCherry-pAAV
Same groups of AAV vectors were tested in HT1080 and HF (6- well plates)                               using CaP transfection protocol.
Transduction of affibody-AAV was performed in HT1080 (chamber slides)

Observation: we looked at cells under inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus)                           connected to an Olympus (DD71) digital capture system.
Immunostaining for Affibody expression according to Immunofluorescent staining protocol:                           cells in chamber slides were stained with primary Ab for FLAG peptide (F1804, Sigma,                           1:500 dilution). Protocols with and w/o permeabilization step were used, to distinguish                           between external and intracellular expression. Alexa-488-conjugated Ab (A21200,                           Life Technologies, 1:250 dilution) was used for visualization. Negative control                           included samples w/o primary Ab. The cells were observed under laser scanning confocal                           microscope (C1si, Nikon). See results here
