It was important for us to include in our study topics such as ethics, culture, society, accessibility of information to the general public in an unusual way. The purpose of the PP activities was to answer questions on various subjects that will integrate with laboratory work. We did our best to invest our time and energy in real long-lasting contribution.</P></H4><TABLE style="width: 100%;"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="4"><H2>Key Achievements</H2><UL><LI>Information accessibility of synthetic biology by an unusual encounter in a pub + performance by stand-up comedian</LI><LI>Communicated with industry to directly influence the way our project was carried out</LI><LI>Ran workshop to bring synthetic biology to public attention </LI><LI>Collaboration with iGEM teams</LI><LI>מסורת של debate / כנס על ביולוגיה סינתטית במסגרת המרכז  לבריאות חברה והומניזם. </LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:30%"><B>Culture and education</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#school">School workshop</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#convention">Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer convention (hosted by Innovation Endeavors, and funded by google)</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#curriculum">Synthetic biology lesson curriculum</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:30%"><B>Public outreach</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Radio">Radio</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#social">Social networks (FB, Twitter)- thousands of followers</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Movie">Movie</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#wix">Developed another website that reached hundreds</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:30%"><B>Ethics and philosophy</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#school">Discussion with bioethics expert</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#school">ייסדנו מפגש שנתי שיתקיים כחלק מפעילות מרכז X  לדיון על תחום הביולוגיה סינתטית</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD><TD style="width:30%"><B>Collaboration with other iGEM teams</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Amoy">China-Amoy university, article</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#France">France-Aix-Maseille, Questioner</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Technion">Israel-Technion, synthetic biology convention</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:30%"><B>Collaboration and panels</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#panels">With experts from the fields of: cancer, synthetic biology, and genetics</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD><TD style="width:30%"><B>Social events</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Bar">Sciene at the Bar</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD></TR><TR><TD style="width:30%"><B>Entrepreneurship</B><UL><LI style="color:black">Lecture to Young Entrepreneurs Program project, and prestigious entrepreneurship MBA program from Australia – Munich</LI><LI style="color:black">Meeting with CEOs of synthetic biology companies</LI><LI style="color:black">Crowd funding</LI><LI style="color:black">Meeting with VC</LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD><TD style="width:30%"><B>Special meetings and experts:</B><UL><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Chief">Meeting with Chief Scientist Office (Ministry of Health)</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#Deans">Univerity president and Deans</A></LI><LI style="color:black"><A href="#director">director of Oncology department at Soroka Medical Center</A></LI></UL></TD><TD style="width:20%"> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style="width: 100%; border-style: hidden;" border="0"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2" style="width: 80%;"><H2>Culture and education</H2></TD></TR><TR><TD style="width: 80%;border-style: hidden;" colspan="2"><H4>School workshop</H4><P>Exposing children to science is crucial for creating the next generation of researchers and their supporters. Therefore, we wanted to make sure that our outreach reached not only adults but children and teenagers as well, to get them thinking at an early age about synthetic biology and the challenges and possibilities it offers. (This way of thinking is expressed in our movie).
            On the morning of 18th June, members of our iGEM team gave a <B>lecture at Degania school (bilingual school:hebrew-arabic).</B> They taught 5&amp;6 grade class and were amazed at the level of questions and knowledge they demonstrated! They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students. Afterwards, they divided the class to 2 groups and played a quiz game (The winning group received a prize).
            <B>We end the workshop with experiment.</B> Growing bacteria, using the bacteria they naturally have on their hands.
            They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.
            Throughout all of our activities we consultant with iGEM BGU alumni polices &amp; practices team.
            They advices us to use the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BGU_Israel/Outreach">great &quot;SynBio Activity Kit for Kids&quot; (iGEM BGU 2013)</A>, that includes detailed explanation about the activities plus all materials needed.

We posted news articles, updates on our progress, and more.
                        In total, we gained 3,674 followers on Facebook, and 214 followers on Twitter.   The majority of people who liked us on Facebook were based in Israel, but we also had plenty of ‘likes’ from people all across the globe.

                Therefore, from the very beginning we have engaged the experts who have a deep understanding of Cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a genuine need as defined by those who know best. 
            On May we organized roundtable discussion with top researchers from the research fields of cancer diagnostics and therapy, Genetics and biology. We wanted the BEST mentorship and advices from the top experts.
