Therefore, we wanted to make sure that we reach not only adults but children and teenagers as well, to get them thinking at an early age about synthetic biology and the challenges and possibilities it offers.
            On the morning of 18th June, members of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Degania school (Hebrew-Arabic bilingual school). They taught 5&amp;6 grade class and were amazed from the level of questions and knowledge they demonstrated! They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students. Afterwards, they divided the class to 2 groups and played a quiz game (the winning group received a prize).
           We ended the workshop with an experiment on growing bacteria, using the bacteria they naturally have on their hands.
            They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.
            Throughout all of our activities we consulted with iGEM BGU alumni polices &amp; practices team.
            They advised us to use the <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:BGU_Israel/Outreach">great &quot;SynBio Activity Kit for Kids&quot; (iGEM BGU 2013)</A>, that includes detailed explanation about the activities plus all materials needed.

We posted news articles, updates on our progress, and more.
                        In total, we gained 3,674 followers on Facebook, and 214 followers on Twitter.   The majority of people who liked us on Facebook were based in Israel, but we also had plenty of ‘likes’ from people all across the globe.

The idea of launching a project should no longer be a scary or daunting experience, riddled with unknowns. It should be a collaborative experience accumulating the knowledge of the hundreds of experts who have already built successful endeavors, and can help you move faster and avoid known pitfalls based on their years of experience.
            
                Therefore, from the very beginning we engaged experts who have a deep understanding of cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a real need and it is designed properly to potentially address it in the future. 
            On May we organized a roundtable discussion with the leading researchers from the fields of cancer diagnostics and therapy, genetics and synthetic biology.
