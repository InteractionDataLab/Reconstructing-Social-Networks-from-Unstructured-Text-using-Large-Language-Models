"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work." — Peter Carr, Director of Judging
The PP group worked and cooperated with the research team in order to develop, communicate, and create a diverse and creative project. It was important for us to include in our project topics such as ethics, culture, society, and accessibility of information to the general public in an unusual way. The purpose of the PP activities was to answer questions on various subjects that will integrate with the laboratory work. We did our best to invest our time and energy in a real long-lasting contribution.

Culture and education
School workshop
Exposing children to science is crucial for creating the next generation of researchers and their supporters. Therefore, we wanted to make sure that we reach not only adults but children and teenagers as well, to get them thinking at an early age about synthetic biology and the challenges and possibilities it offers.
On the morning of 18th June, members of our iGEM team gave a lecture at Degania school (Hebrew-Arabic bilingual school). They taught 5&6 grade class and were amazed from the level of questions and knowledge they demonstrated! They introduced the basic knowledge of Synthetic Biology to the students. Afterwards, they divided the class to 2 groups and played a quiz game (the winning group received a prize).            We ended the workshop with an experiment on growing bacteria, using the bacteria they naturally have on their hands.
They were curious about the biology world and asked many questions related to our work.             Throughout all of our activities we consulted with iGEM BGU alumni polices & practices team.             They advised us to use the great "SynBio Activity Kit for Kids" (iGEM BGU 2013) , that includes detailed explanation about the activities plus all materials needed.
    
    
Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer convention
Hosted by Innovation Endeavors
On July 7th, we participated in Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer Convention that was held in Tel-Aviv, and was hosted by Innovation Endeavors - early stage VC co-founded by Eric Schmidt (Google executive chairman). We presented our project in front of entrepreneurs, researchers, and students.
Public outreach
Radio
On June 9th and September 20 we were interviewed by two of the leading radio channels in Israel. (South radio 101.5FM, Reshet-Bet 95.5 FM).
We explained about synthetic biology, and presented our project.
Social networks (FB, Twitter)
In addition to reaching out to people based locally and across the country, we wanted to communicate with people on a global scale. To achieve this; we utilized Facebook and Twitter to reach fellow iGEM teams, friends, family and indeed anybody who is interested in what we had to say! We posted news articles, updates on our progress, and more.
In total, we gained 3,674 followers on Facebook, and 214 followers on Twitter.
The majority of people who liked us on Facebook were based in Israel, but we also had plenty of ‘likes’ from people all across the globe.
Video
We invested a lot of time and effort in a short video animation that will allow us to reach the widest audience possible. For many people, synthetic biology might be scary, difficult, and complicated. Through a video, we might be able to show these people a new point of view of synthetic biology, and allow them to visualize our idea and create an exciting adventure in their mind. In the video we also explained about the iGEM competition and our project.

Website
We launched an external website .
Social events
Science on the Bar
On September 9th we held a lecture at a bar in Tel Aviv, according to the concept of "science on the bar" which is very trendy in Israel. We explained about synthetic biology, IGEM, and the Boomerang project.
In addition, there was a performance by a stand-up comedian, Eyal Eltawil, who recovered from cancer. He created a stand-up act about his life with the disease and his personal experience.
Conventions
We attended various conferences and discussions.
We presented at the Synthetic and Computational Biology Mixer Convention.
Lectured to Monash-Ben Gurion Universities Entrepreneurship Program Students.
We presented at YEI (Young Entrepreneurs Israel) convention. YEI is the leading organization in Israel providing extra curriculum entrepreneurial education for youth of all social classes and segments. Providing the youth with entrepreneurial knowledge and experience creates a solid foundation for Israel’s future economic progress.
On September 9th, We were invited along with the other Israeli iGEM teams to the Technion - Mini Jamboree Event.
Here, each team presented their project, and a panel of judges asked questions and gave tips for improvement and better preparation for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Collaboration with other iGEM teams
France-Aix-Maseille, Questioner
Aix-Marseille Université (France), proposed a collaboration. They needed to collect a lot of information about chewing-gum and GMOs around the world. Since we love chewing-gum we immediately decided to participate.  They prepared a small survey, and we went to the country streets and interviewed random people. It was a fun challenge. We received a gold badge for our help.
   
China-Amoy university, article
Amoy university issued monthly newsletter. We had the honor to collaborate and publish an article about our project in the fifth issue of 2015 Newsletter.
Israel-Technion, Mini Jamboree
On September 9th, We were invited along with the other Israeli iGEM teams to the Technion - Mini Jamboree Event.
Here, each team presented their project, and a panel of judges asked questions and gave tips for improvement and better preparation for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Collaboration and panels
Round table
Mentors and advisors are one of the most valuable resources a young researcher/entrepreneur should tap into. The idea of launching a project should no longer be a scary or daunting experience, riddled with unknowns. It should be a collaborative experience accumulating the knowledge of the hundreds of experts who have already built successful endeavors, and can help you move faster and avoid known pitfalls based on their years of experience.
Therefore, from the very beginning we engaged experts who have a deep understanding of cancer in order to ensure that our project is addressing a real need and it is designed properly to potentially address it in the future.              On May we organized a roundtable discussion with the leading researchers from the fields of cancer diagnostics and therapy, genetics and synthetic biology.
We managed to bring together the following experts:
Prof. Roni Apte ,  Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics expert
Prof. Etta Livneh , Immunology and Genetics expert
Dr. Ayelet David , Cancer, Nano-medicine, Polymers, Pharmacology expert
Dr. Noam Levaot ,Physiology, Cell and Synthetic Biology expert
