Welcome to UCSF's iGEM 2015 Home Page!
This year, our project in centered around the theme of communication and understanding the design principles which underlie community behaviors. In particular, we want to understand how groups of cells can make decisions. Cells in a local population usually have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus. This noisiness may be due to differences in extracelluar environment or intracellular molecular makeup. Yet these cells often need to coordinate and respond in a specific way. Our project seeks to understand the complex intercellular interactions that must happen to produce such a specific community phenotype. Using yeast as our model organism, our goal is to create a synthetic framework that uses cellular communities to model collective behaviors emergent from individual autonomous rules.
To learn more how we are studying communication in other forums, please head over to our Policy & Practices Video Series linked below!
