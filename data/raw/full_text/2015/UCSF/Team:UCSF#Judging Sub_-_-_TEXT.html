SAFETY
Safety is our team's #1 priority. Throughout the summer, all team members practiced proper lab safety protocols, such as wearing personal protective equipment and disposing of materials into their correct areas. All lab work was kept at Biosafety Level 1 and team members were aware of any potential risks present in the lab.
