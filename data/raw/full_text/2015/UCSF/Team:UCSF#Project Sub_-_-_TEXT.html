DESCRIPTION
We are building a synthetic model in S. cerevisiae to understand communication's role in biological decision-making. Our model consists of four main parts: Basic Circuit, Positive Feedback, Signal Degradation, and Clustering. Using the model, we hope to be able to cause a population divergence with an outside stimulus.

MODELING
Our project this year is centered around the emergence of distinct community phenotypes when individuals in a population are allowed to communicate. Focusing on the community phenotype of bimodal activation, our model aims to mathematically estimate distinct states of multiple cells in the population in different immediate extracellular environments.

RESULTS
Our goal for our circuit is to elicit a divergent community response from two genetically similar cells by varying different communication parameters. To measure distinct community responses in our circuit, we will look at INDIVIDUAL (GFP) response versus COMMUNITY (RFP) response.

PARTS
Our project consisted of different promoters, fluorescent proteins, and many other parts that contributed to our overall circuit. We are making many of these parts available to the public by submitting them to the parts registry. Our team has worked painstakingly throughout the final weeks of the summer to adapt our parts to be BioBrick compatible. By ordering our parts you can recreate 2015 UCSF iGEM project by constructing our circuit.
