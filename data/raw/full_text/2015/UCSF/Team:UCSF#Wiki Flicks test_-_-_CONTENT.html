Every year, iGEM teams across the world work diligently all summer long on their individual projects. And every year, these projects are documented on each team’s wiki page. Although wikis are a great, and open-source way to depict all aspects of a team’s project, it still requires a scientific background to fully understand, making it less accessible to a non-specialist audience.
    </P><P class="content1">
For UCSF iGEM’s Policy and Practices this year, we are addressing issues of communication, specifically between the scientific community and the general public. We believe that by translating a team’s wiki page into a short, interesting video, we can better communicate our projects to everyone. UCSF iGEM encourages your team to be as creative as possible! This is a fantastic way to effectively convey your project not just to the iGEM community, but to the whole world in 3 short, easy minutes. You want your video to be informative, but also easily comprehensible for ANY viewer out there. Take this as an opportunity to explore new ways to communicate your awesome projects!
    </P><H2 class="Header">GUIDELINES</H2><P class="content1"><UL class="content1"><LI>This video should be your iGEM team’s project overview/abstract -- what motivates your team and why the project is important. No data required!
      </LI><LI>You must explain your project <U>without technical jargon</U>. Seriously. Remember, everyone should be able to understand your project, even if they don’t have a scientific or synthetic biology background!
      </LI><LI>Be sure to include all acknowledgements and references at the end of your video.
      </LI><LI><I>Include mention of any copyrighted media production including, but not limited to: music, films, books, other video clips, or any other media property</I></LI></UL></P><P class="content1" style="color:#48C2CA; font-size:3em">
Good questions to think about when making/before uploading your video:

    <UL class="content1"><LI>Does the video sufficiently convey the background to the research project and the project’s significance?
      </LI><LI>Does the video clearly show key results of the projects (if you have them!), including conclusions and future directions?
      </LI><LI>Was all this information communicated in a way that any audience can understand it?
      </LI><LI>Does the video avoid scientific jargon and explain any terminology well enough for any audience to follow and understand?
      </LI><LI>Does the video convey enthusiasm for the project?
      </LI><LI>Can the video captivate any audience?
