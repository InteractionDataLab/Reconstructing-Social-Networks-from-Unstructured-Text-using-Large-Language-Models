Bar1: Protease that Cleaves Alpha Factor
The Bar1 gene codes for the production of Bar1, a protease that degrades the yeast mating pheromone alpha factor. It has homology to aspartic proteases and has endopeptidase action that cleaves alpha factor between 6-Leu and 7-Lys. Bar1 is secreted into the periplasmic space between the cell membrane and cell wall of MATa S. cerevisiae. It is heavily glycolysated and maintained in the transmembrane space in yeast cells, where it creates a pheromone sinkhole that desensitizes yeast cells to alpha factor signal and sharpens concentration gradients of alpha factor.

pBar1: Mating Factor Alpha Responsive Promoter
The pBar1 promoter is a mating factor alpha responsive promoter found endogenously in MATa S. cerevisiae. This promoter drives expression of Bar1, a protease that cleaves mating factor alpha.

pFig2c: Mating Factor Alpha Responsive Promoter
pFig2c is a mating factor alpha responsive promoter, meaning that it is activated by the presence of mating factor alpha. It is endogenous to S. cerevisiae cells and is followed by the Fig2 gene. The Fig2 gene is a part of the mating pathway in S. cerevisiae, it contributes to maintaining cell wall integrity when the cells project ("shmoo") towards each other.

pAga1: mating factor alpha responsive promoter
pAga1 is a mating factor alpha responsive promoter that is found endogenously in MATa S. cerevisiae (budding yeast). pAga1 activates the Aga1 gene, which contributes in the S. cerevisiae mating pathway by supporting cell structure as mating yeast cells project, or "shmoo," towards each other. pAga1 is activated by the presence of mating factor alpha (aka alpha factor) which is endogenously secreted by MATÎ± type cells.

Mating Factor Alpha (mFalpha)
Mating pheromone endogenous/secreted by the mating type A yeast. Sensed by mating type alpha yeast. Codes for four copies of 13 amino acid peptides.

Ste2: ligand receptor of mating factor alpha
Ste2 is an integral ligand receptor of alpha factor found endogenously in MATa S. cerevisiae (budding yeast). This is an improved version of the existing Ste2 part ( BBa_I766204 ) which has been made BioBrick compatible by introducing a silent mutation to remove an internal PstI cut site.
