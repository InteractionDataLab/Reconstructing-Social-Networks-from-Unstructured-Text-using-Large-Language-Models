ABSTRACT
This year, our project is centered around the theme of communication and understanding the design principles which underlie community behaviors. In particular, we want to understand how groups of cells can make decisions. Cells in a local population usually have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus. This noisiness may be due to differences in extracelluar environment or intracellular molecular makeup. Yet these cells often need to coordinate and respond in a specific way. Our project seeks to understand the complex intercellular interactions that must happen to produce such a specific community phenotype. Using yeast as our model organism, our goal is to create a synthetic framework that uses cellular communities to model collective behaviors emergent from individual autonomous rules.
