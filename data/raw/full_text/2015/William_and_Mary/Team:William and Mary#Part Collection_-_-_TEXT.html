Part Collection
In keeping with our theme of promoter effects on transcription, we created a suite of guide RNAs for the targeted dCas9 repression of 11 of the most frequently used promoters in the Registry. For cells which express a dCas9 protein, the transformation of any of our guide RNA parts will repress the expression of any protein under the associated promoter. We also included a scrambled guide RNA to serve as a negative control for troubleshooting purposes.
(BELOW) An example of repression: fluorescence values for RFP under the R0010 promoter, in cells with and without the R0010 guide RNA.
The breadth of the variety in our part collection provides future teams with the flexibility required to actualize their network designs without inhibition from a lack of resources.
