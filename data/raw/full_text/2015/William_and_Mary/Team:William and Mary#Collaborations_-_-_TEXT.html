Interlab Measurement Study
We participated in the Interlab Measurement Study! You can learn more about our process and results on our Interlab Study page.
PenPal Program
We created a pen pal program for iGEM teams to easily get in touch with other teams that had shared interests or project topics. This facilitated collaboration between other teams. To participate, teams filled out a five-minute survey. Based on the responses, we matched teams and gave them each other's contact information.
Teams Participating:
Based on project and collaboration ideas.

Collaborating with other teams
Inter-team collaboration is a hallmark of iGEM. We collaborated with three different teams in the 2015 iGEM season. We assisted the University of Maryland team with the Interlab Measurement Study. We also helped out the Cambridge-JIC team by supplying them with fluorescent constructs to serve as positive controls for their Project: OpenScope 3D Printed Fluorescent Microscope Initiative. Finally, we participated in a collaborative effort with the University of Georgia iGEM team to determine fluorescence values for mCherry proteins controlled under an archaeal RBS library.

Collaboration with Maryland
In June, we attended a meetup hosted by the University of Maryland iGEM team, where we met and exchanged ideas with members of teams from Duke, UMD, UVA, and Rockridge High School.
Additionally, we assisted UMD with the iGEM Interlab Measurement Study by assembling J23117 + I13504 for them and sending them the plasmid. We did this using DNA Synthesis and Gibson Assembly methods.
Collaboration With University of Georgia
The William and Mary iGEM team participated in a collaborative effort (with the University of Georgia iGEM team) to determine fluorescence values for mCherry controlled under an archaeal RBS library. This was the first organized attempt to determine the impact of specific archaeal RBSes in protein expression. Since there is little existing framework for archaeal work, the collaboration effort promoted the utilization of methanogenic archaea or methanogens as a potential substitute host for situations when E. coli is not the logical choice. The study could lay the framework for a new archaea-based InterLab Study modeled after the existent iGEM-sponsored E. Coli InterLab Study. The team imaged 29 samples for the UGA iGEM team and recorded fluorescence measurements for the samples. Data was reported to the UGA iGEM team.
Collaboration With Cambridge-JIC
Cambridge-JIC iGEM 2015 is working on Project OpenScope, an initiative to create a 3d-printable programmable digital microscope. Upon request, we provided them with replicates of fluorescent constructs which we created for the Interlab Measurement Study (J23106 + I13504 and J23117 + I13504). They wanted green fluorescent samples with which to test the imaging capabilities of their microscope and the collaboration allowed us the opportunity to confirm that our some of our InterLab constructs were actually fluorescing as they should. Cambridge was successful in visualizing the fluorescent constructs and sent us images.
