Integrator Cassette
The Composite Part
BBa_K1795023
For our method of genome integration the input is linear DNA, generated by PCR, containing what you would like to integrate onto the genome and an antibiotic resistance cassette to allow for selection. The galK Integrator allows digestion with the standard BioBrick enzymes and 3A assembly of your part of interest to create the integration construct (see right).  This product can then be amplified using primers ( details found here ) and then used in the integration protocol. We have successfully used the integrator to incorporate stretches of DNA up to 2.1kb into the galK locus, not including the resistance cassette (1179 bp).
Antibiotic Operon
BBa_K1795024
Provides Kanamycin Resistance to the cell under the Promoter R0010.
dCas9s
The Basic Part
BBa_K1795000
BBa_K1795001
Part BBa_K1795000 is a dCas9 protein-coding region that has been optimized for expression in E. coli. Additionally, we created a functional dCas9 operon ( BBa_K1795001 ) that, when transformed into E. coli is constitutively expressed.  For further details, please see our Basic Part page.

Part:BBa_K17950007 J23101 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950008 J23106 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950009 J23117 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950010 J23119 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950011 I13453 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950012 I0500 gRNA
Part:BBa_K17950013 Scrambled gRNA
To complete our creation of a codon-optimized dCas9 parts, we created functional gRNAs that target the most commonly used promoters in iGEM. These parts (BBa_K1795002- BBa_K1795012), when transformed into E. coli, constitutively express gRNA that, in complex with our dCas9 variant, will repress transcription of the targeted promoter.  We have also contributed a Scrambled gRNA ( Part:BBa_K17950013 ) that does not target any region in the E. coli genome and can be used as a negative control. For further details about our gRNAs, please see our Part Collection page.
CFPs/YFPs Under Various Promoters
Part:BBa_K1795014 YFP-LVA under R0040
Part:BBa_K1795015 CFP-LVA under R0011
Part:BBa_K1795016 YFP-LVA under R0011
Part:BBa_K1795017 YFP-LVA under R0062
Part:BBa_K1795018 CFP-LVA under I13453
Part:BBa_K1795019 YFP-LVA under I13453
Part:BBa_K1795020 CFP-LVA under R0051
Part:BBa_K1795021 CFP-LVA under I0500
In order to test multiple promoters for their intrinsic noise, we needed to construct composite parts that had the structure seen to the right.  In each construct the RBS and DT were kept constant throughout, but the promoter used to drive transcription was changed. Each construct was made in a CFP and YFP variant. Both the CFP and YFP used in this project have an LVA tag, decreasing the half-life of the protein. All of these parts have been sequenced confirmed and functionally validated.
Dual Fluorescent Plasmid
Part:BBa_K1795022
This plasmid consists of both a CFP-LVA driven by R0010 and YFP-LVA driven by R0010. This allows future teams to use this part to investigate transcriptional noise either on a low copy number plasmid or by integrating this part using our galK integrator .
