Interlab Study
We created our fluorescent constructs using DNA synthesis and Gibson Assembly. The constructs we measured were J23101 + I13504, J23106 + I13504, and J23117 + I13504.  We assembled the gBlocks using our Gibson assembly protocol , and imaged the constructs using our imaging protocol .
Cells were identified using Nikon Elements Software version 7.1 using binary thresholding on the GFP channel. Nikon Elements Software was then used to calculate mean fluorescence per cell and data was exported to Excel for final data analysis.
Our data are shown below:
