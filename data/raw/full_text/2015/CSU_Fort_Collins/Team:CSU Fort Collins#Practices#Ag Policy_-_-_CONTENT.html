     Most Americans are well-aware that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are a part of the food supply. According to the <A href="”" http:="">Library of Congress</A>, at least 90% of the soybeans, cotton, and corn grown in the US in 2013 were genetically engineered for herbicide or insect resistance. The United States also ranks number one in genetically modified crop production. With how prevalent GM crops are in today’s society, it’s a wonder that people still live in fear of eating GM foods. GMOs are constantly boosting the biotechnology industry in America and food supply is a massive part of our economy. The more GMOs benefit society, the more willing investors are to pump dollars into the biotech industry, which helps keep science funded in the US.
 
     Even with how beneficial GMOs have been to the US economy, there is still a lack of transparency in how GMOs are regulated. There are three main categories of GMOs in the US, each governed under different regulatory acts. When most people think of GM crops they picture fields of herbicide-resistant corn or soybean. These GM plants are governed by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and fall under the Plant Protection Act. Unfortunately, these genetically engineered crops can transfer genes to weeds and other surrounding plants, possibly giving them unwanted increased resistance to herbicides. This can lead to use of even more herbicides <A href="“http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/food-agriculture/our-failing-food-system/genetic-engineering-agriculture#.Vd5d7PlViko”">which are often fairly toxic</A> chemicals. However, there is a hefty amount of regulation on these crops before they can be introduced into the environment. Under the Plant Protection Act, the Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to stop the introduction of a plant pest or noxious weed.  Most GM plants are considered potential pests under APHIS. This allows the EPA to screen all GM plants before they’re introduced to the public.

     So how are GM bacteria or other microorganisms regulated when they are used as fertilizer or pesticides? These products fall under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), or the Toxic Substances Control Act. In order to use products in this category commercially, it must be shown that they are not harmful to human health or the environment. Under the EPA, any GM microorganisms can be subject to regulation through the Toxic Substances Control Act, while pesticides (including plants that are modified to produce pesticides) are regulated under FIFRA.

    The regulation of GMOs varies widely depending on what the organism is, how it was produced, and what it will ultimately be used for. Some GMOs may be easier to get accepted for use than others, but all GMOs require approval by the US government before they are able to be used commercially. It may seem odd that the US has yet to adopt federal legislation on GMOs and instead regulate them under health, safety, and environmental legislation. Regulation can differ state to state, however, as state laws can limit or prohibit the use of GMOs all-together. In 2013, a county in Hawaii <A href="”" http:="">voted to require notification when companies use GMOs</A> or pesticides on the island. There is a lot of controversy surrounding GMOs in the US food supply, but before you get weary of eating your favorite fruits or veggies, just remember there are many requirements that must be met before any GMO goes from the lab to the field.
