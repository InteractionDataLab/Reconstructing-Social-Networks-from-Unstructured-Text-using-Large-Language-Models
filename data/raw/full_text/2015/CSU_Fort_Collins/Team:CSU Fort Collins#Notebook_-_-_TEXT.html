>
InterLab: Miniprep J23101 A and F using Promega kit and sent them off for sequencing.Decided to move ahead because the sizes from the gel looked correct. Digested  1ug of J23101 F. Decided to start more overnights from A and F J23101 colonies in case digestion doesn’t work. Sequencing confirmed for J23106 and I13504, digested J23106 and I13504 was done incorrectly because no PCR  clean up was used.

Successful
7/15/15:
InterLab: Made  J23106 and I13504 overnight cultures for sequencing.
7/17/15:
Created media and prepared flasks for trans-zeatin growth experiment. The experiment needed to be repeated because we suspected that 1 day was not long enough for the trans-zeatin to be created in detectable amounts.
InterLab: Minipreped J23106 and I13504 and sent the off for sequencing.
7/19/15:
Created overnight cultures of strains for trans-zeatin growth experiment.
7/20/15:
Day 1 of trans-zeatin growth experiment.
.
InterLab: Although the prefix and J23101sequences are correct, I13504 and the suffix are unclear. The chromatogram signals for these last two regions were also very weak. I think the sequence is correct because Construct 2 group (Dylan, Dakota, Sam and Aidan) sequenced I13504. I will send for sequencing again.
7/21/15:
Day 2 of trans-zeatin growth experiment.
7/22/15:

8/12/15:
InterLab: Miniprep J23117.
8/17/15:
Overnight cultures of P_lac and P_lac+FadD were started.
InterLab: If the suffix sequence is correct, I think the I13504 sequence is most likely correct as well. At the mismatched sequences, there was a high background signal. I think this part is good for use in the Interlab measurements. Digestion J23117, ligation: J23117 and I13504, and transformed. Need to make glycerol stock of J23117. Prepare overnight culture.
8/18/15:
ODs were taken on overnight samples of P_lac and P_lac+FadD. Results were inconclusive as P_lac cells grew to a higher OD and much faster than the P_lac+FadD cells. KR+P_lac was transformed and an overnight culture was started. Foil was used the whole time to prevent cells from being exposed to light. Trans-Zeatin+FadD was transformed and an overnight culture was started.
