General Support
Thank you to Dr. Christie Peebles, our advisor, as well as Dr. Ashok Prasad and Dr. Tom Santangelo for their support and guidance throughout the project, and for the donation of their time, protocols, and expertise. Thank you to Ali Sharifi-Zarchi for his feedback and assistance when choosing a project idea. Thank you as well to Shaun Milligan from CSU's College of Engineering who provided us with advice and assistance throughout the fundraising process.
Outside Experts
Thank you to Dr. Andrea Haight for speaking with us for our human practices blog and to Rodman Tompkins from CSU Ventures for giving us advice on filing a provisional patent. We would also like to thank Dr. Jeffrey Kasser from the CSU Department of Philosophy for giving a lecture on the philosophy of science and biology for our Colorado iGEM meetup. We also had the pleasure of meeting with employees of the City of Fort Collins, who gave us feedback on how our process fits in with local industry.
Sponsors
We would like to thank our sponsors - Bioexpress, Colorado State University's College of Engineering, College of Natural Sciences, and Office of the Vice President of Research, Genscript, Hawthorne Education, Pacific Bell, Promega, QBE, and QuintaraBio - for their kind donations of supplies, services, and funds which made our research possible.
Project Attribution
Our project is a continuation of the CSU iGEM project from 2014, which you can view here . Thank you to all the team members from last year who contributed to this project. Design and research for the project was largely done throughout the 2014 competition season. All of the plasmid construction and running of experiments was completed by members of the 2015 CSU iGEM team.
Wiki Creation
Our wiki design was created by Aidan Ceney and Olivia Smith, members of the 2015 CSU iGEM team. All team members were responsible for creating content for the wiki which was relevant to the work they did in the lab. Thank you to Scott Ogle for photographing our members and editing the photos for the wiki.
