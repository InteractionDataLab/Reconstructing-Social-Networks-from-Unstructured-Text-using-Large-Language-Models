Using frying oil to produce trans-zeatin in an engineered strain of E. coli
Project
Frying oil waste is full of high-energy molecules. While it is currently recycled into biofuels and cosmetics, we believe that spent frying oil can be used to provide energy for product manufacturing. Our target was trans-zeatin, a plant growth hormone with applications in food, fuel, and feed.

Results
We created and characterized new biobricks. We ran and re-ran experiments. We built prototypes. Learn about our experiments and see the results of all of our hard work from this year.
