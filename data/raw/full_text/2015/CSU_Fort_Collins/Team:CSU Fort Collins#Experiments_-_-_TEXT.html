Add 700 μL of aliquoted Antibiotic
INSIDE THE HOOD:
Spray the sleeve of plates, the agar media, the marker, and the tape down with ethanol before putting them in the hood. When opening the sleeve of plates, be careful to not rip it because you will put the plates back into it.
Following sterile technique pour the plates about a 3rd of the way full
Allow to cool in the hood until they have solidified and are no longer warm
Turn the plates upside down and put back in the sleeve
Tape the sleeve shut and write the antibiotic and the date they were made on the tape.

Gel Electrophoresis
Gel Electrophoresis
Materials
Agarose
1X TAE Buffer
Parafilm
Electrophoresis chamber and power source
SYBR Green
Loading Dye
DNA Ladder
PCR Samples
Procedure
Using a balance, mass out 0.5 gram of agarose (for 1% gel, for 2% mass out 1.0 gram). Mix this with 50 mL of TAE 1X Buffer.
Microwave the mixture, mixing by swirling intermittently, until all the agarose is dissolved and the mixture is homogeneous and clear (about 2 minutes).
Pour the mixture into a gel plate and insert a correctly-sized comb (8, 10, etc. lanes). Allow to cool and solidify on the benchtop.
Mix your samples on a piece of parafilm. Use 10 μL of the appropriate DNA Ladder (1 kb, 100 bp, 2 log, etc.) combined with 1 μL SYBR Green/DMSO in the first lane. For all samples, mix 10 μl of sample and 2 μL of SYBR Green/Dye Mixture.
Place gel in tray into the gel electrophoresis apparatus - wells should be close to the negative (conventionally black) end. Fill apparatus with 1X TAE until the gel is completely submerged. Do not overfill - there is a guide sticker on the apparatus which marks the max fill line.
Load 10 μL of each sample into the appropriate wells.
Connect wiring and run gel electrophoresis at 110 V for 1 hour.
Analyze gel in UV light and see if samples match the expected size using the ladder as a guide.
