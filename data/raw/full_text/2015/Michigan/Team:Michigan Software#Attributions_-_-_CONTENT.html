    I'm Josh Abramson, one of the team's co-founders and the current president. Hailing from West Bloomfield, I've made a living studying Biology, Mathematics, and Chemical Physics at the University of Michigan. Before leading the software team, I was on the Michigan lab team for 4 years as a member and 1 year as an advisor. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy tree climbing, playing pranks on my professors, and computer games.

Hi, my name is Hy Doan and I am from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I am junior studying Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy playing/listening to jazz, exercising, and destroying friendships while playing Settlers of Catan (or any other board game). Along with school, I am in Groove Performance Group, an awesome percussion group, and I volunteer with Ready Set Start, teaching music workshops.

    I am Graham, a senior at U of M, studying Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing settlers of Catan. I wanted ProtoCat to be called ProtoDog but that wouldn't make any sense.

Hi, my name is Max Gittelman. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at U of M. I enjoy eating pizza at team meetings and allowing my younger twin brother to copy whatever I do. I fortunately am a dog person and highly recommended the name “Protodog” but the name was quickly struck down due to its non puniness. Also Graham steals jokes.

   Hi, my name is Zachary Gittelman and I am a Junior studying Computer Science Engineering. I am from Miami, Florida and my interest in biotech has lead me to join the BioSoft team. Additionally, I am on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team and I enjoy learning about AI, running, skiing, and mimicking my twin Max. And remember, if you’re not the first cat, you’re the last cat.

Hi, I'm Ali Hammoud. I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in biochemistry and computer science. I spend a lot of my time studying for classes and working in a clinical research lab, but in my spare time I enjoy cooking and spending time with friends.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="Orange"><DIV class="LeftText" style="padding-top:17%;">
    Hello, I’m Ali Turfah. I am a sophomore and I plan to major in a form of Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy designing as well as building costumes, playing video games, and studying languages, both spoken and computer. I have two cats, so I’m really excited about the ProtoCat designs.

I am Campbell Yore, a patent agent registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and a third year law student at Santa Clara University School of Law. My technical background is in organic chemistry and bioelectronic materials. Biology is Technology, a book by Robert Karelson, introduced me to iGEM and the possibilities of synthetic biology and I've been hooked ever since. Collaborating with other groups, learning about biological circuit design, and advocating for student entrepreneurs are my favorite parts of participating in iGEM.
