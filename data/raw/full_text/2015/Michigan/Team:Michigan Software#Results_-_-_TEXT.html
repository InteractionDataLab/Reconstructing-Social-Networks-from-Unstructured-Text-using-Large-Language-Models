Protocat 2.0 is a crowd sourced catalog of protocol. Non-registered users can only search for and access the protocols stored in our database. On the other hand, registered users have access to Protocat 2.0's full capabilities. In addition to searching for protocol, registered users can upload and edit protocol of their own their own. Registered users can also rate and comment on others' protocol, generating feedback for the author about the efficacy of his/her protocol.
New Features in Protocat 2.0:
Refined search engine
Protocol can be rated
Protocol can be both sorted and reverse sorted
Protocat users can register an account and have user pages
Future Improvements
Implement version control
Implement variable protocol for limited supplies of reagents
Implement experiment modeling
Implement a timer for time-sensitive protocol
Link users to reagent suppliers
Grow protocat userbase and protocol repository
Medal Requirements
Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree. DONE
Complete the Judging form. DONE
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts (if any) using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. DONE
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information. DONE
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. DONE
Develop and make available, via the iGEM GitHub page, an open source software that supports Synthetic Biology based on Standard Parts or interacts with the Registry. DONE
Silver
Provide a comprehensive, well-designed User Guide for your software and upload it to your wiki. Be creative! (An instructional video may work as well.) DONE
Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than "only" a stand-alone app for end users.) DONE
Demonstrate that you followed best practices in software development so that other developers can modify, use, and reuse your code. Provide more than one realistic test case. Examples of best practices are automated unit testing and documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities, and documentation of releases and changes between releases. DONE Code and Test Coverage
Gold
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. DONE
Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the issue by creating an online software solution. Protocat was designed based on a survey we sent to lab teams.
Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials. We expanded upon Michigan Software 2014's project.
Demonstrate your software at the iGEM Giant Jamboree in the software demo suite. You should show a functional prototype that teams can use in following years. DONE
