TEAM
Experimental reproducibility is hindered by current protocols. So we fixed it!
Project
ProtoCat 2.0 is a free, open-source online catalog of laboratory protocols with improvements upon last yearâ€™s project including a larger protocol database and a website with more advanced features.  By using ProtoCat 2.0, users can find tested, reliable protocols from across the globe all in one place.
Outreach
In order to create the most helpful, effective protocol catalog possible, we created a survey asking other labs and other iGEM teams what struggles they have had with using protocols in the past, how ProtoCat 2.0 could address these problems, and what they would like to see in ProtoCat 2.0.
Software
Here you can find an installation guide, the user guide, and documentation for Protocat 2.0.
