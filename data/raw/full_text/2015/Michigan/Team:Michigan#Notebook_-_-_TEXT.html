-We got some plasmids from Dr. Allen Liu Lab, these plasmids were used in the Green paper and we plan to compare their expression to the expression of the switches we designed.
6/15/2015
-Made ampicillin and chloramphenicol plates
6/16/2015
-Plasmid transformation of plasmids we obtained using 1ul of DNA and 50uls of NEB competent cells
6/17/2015
-Made cultures from colonies of transformation
6/18/2015
-Mini-prep of plasmids from cultures
-Sent for sequencing with double primers
6/22/2015
-Miniprep of Liu lab plasmids. Stored in yellow rack in the freezer
-Sequence verified
6/28/2015
-Plasmid transformations of both switches from synthesis order (G flip and H flip)
-Diluted synthesis with 50uls of ultra pure water, so we should have a concentration of 80ug/ul
-pIDTBlue vector from IDT has amp resistance
-NOTE: one of the unused Amp plate had contamination (undesired colony), once we get the plasmid transformation colonies, we should transfer them to new Amp plates. Need to get new Amp
6/29/2015
-pick colonies from plasmid transformations to miniprep
-NOTE: New Amp is on the fridge
6/30/2015
-Miniprep G and H switch flip
