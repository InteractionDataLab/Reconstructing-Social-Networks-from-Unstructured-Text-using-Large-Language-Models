In our design process, we brainstormed what proteins Aptapaper could be used to detect. In our discussions, gluten was an option that we wanted to explore. Found in wheat, gluten can cause adverse reactions in humans. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that produces pain and discomfort in the digestive tract, featuring constipation, diarrhea, and fatigue. The only treatment is a gluten-free diet. Because of the high amount of wheat in foods today, creating a device to test for such proteins will greatly aid those who suffer from celiac disease.
We were able to interview You-Lin Kuo, a senior food scientist from the Kellogg Company. In our discussion, we discussed the ever-changing demands on the food industry to keep up with consumer diets. We learned about the requirements that companies must adhere to in order to have their food products certified as gluten free. Great care must be taken in all steps of the food product creation, even transportation, to ensure that no cross contamination with wheat and other allergens occurs. Kuo reported that food companies will typically rely on their ingredient suppliers to get gluten free certification rather than testing the ingredients by themselves, so a device like Aptapaper might not currently be necessary. However, Kuo did conclude that an affordable and simple testing device would be attractive to consumers, especially for those who are really sensitive to gluten.
