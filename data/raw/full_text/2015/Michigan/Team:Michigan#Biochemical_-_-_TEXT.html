Cayman Chemical
To further inform the design of our project, we turned to Cayman Chemical.
Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Cayman Chemical provides products and services to advance scientific research. Early in June, members of our team were able to meet with a group of researchers at Cayman in order to propose the idea of Aptapaper to them. We were pleasantly surprised to find that a few of the researchers had many years of specialized experience in working with aptamers. With Cayman Chemical's experience in developing pharmaceuticals and point-of-care products to advance healthcare, the knowledge we gained was invaluable to our design process. The meeting was an incredible chance to propose our project to a group of highly skilled scientific researchers and gain feedback on how to continue our work.
