Project Design
Jennifer Knister was inspired to develop an adaptable protein detection switch after hearing Keith Pardee’s seminar at U of M and proposed the project to the team and advisors.  Jenn led team members on a handful of switch design meetings, and Nick Emery found the FRET switch in the Nutiu paper.  Together, Nick and Jenn designed the switches and came up with various versions (different stem length, different amounts of aptamer exposed, etc) to test, and ordered the nucleotide sequences from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).  The switch design work was done on and off, May – September.
Project Support
Professor Marc Ammerlaan, Professor Anuj Kumar, Adam Krieger, Drew Dunham, and Matt McGuffie offered general project feedback.  Marc Ammerlaan was a general team advisor who oversaw the team and helped them navigate the iGEM competition. Professor David Sept, from U of M’s Biomedical Engineering department, advised the team on modeling the Switch 1.0.  Professor Nils Walter, from the U of M’s Chemical Biology department, reviewed the Switch 1.0 and project design.
Experimental Work
The experiments to test the switches were designed by Cristina Castillo, Nick Emery, and Jennifer Knister.  The experiments were done by Cristina Castillo, Nick Emery, Jennifer Knister, and Jeremy Kuo.  The plasmid DNA was prepared by Cristina.  Cristina also ordered laboratory supplies though U of M.
Laboratory Space
Cloning and prep work was done in a lab classroom in U of M’s Undergraduate Science Building, special thanks to Marc Ammerlaan and Denis Drobeck for coordinating this!  Experiments were done in Professor Allen Liu’s lab in U of M’s Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering Department.  Special thanks to the Liu lab for letting the team use their laboratory and teaching the team how to use their plate reader!
Cloning
Cristina Castillo cloned the submission plasmid.
Disease and Existing Detection Literature Review
Jeremy Kuo, Becca Loechli, Rachel Sun did the literature review.
Survey
Survey questions were written by Jennifer Knister.  The survey was conducted by Christine Hathaway.
Modeling
Modeling was done by Nick Emery.
Outreach
Cristina Castillo, Jeremy Kuo, Nick Emery, Adam Kreiger, Malcolm Childs, and Becca Loechli assisted at the WISE and GISE camps. Cristina Castillo and Jennifer Knister did collaborations with other iGEM teams.
Poster and Presentation
The poster and presentation were done by Jennifer Knister, Nick Emery, Cristina Castillo, and Jeremy Kuo.  The listed advisors gave feedback on the presentation.
Wiki
Max Gittelman and Jeremy Kuo did the layout of the wiki.  Cristina Castillo, Jennifer Knister, Jeremy Kuo, Nick Emery, Becca Loechli, and Rachel Sun wrote the text that appears on the wiki.
Fundraising and Non-Laboratory Purchases
Jeremy Kuo did all fundraising and non-laboratory purchases.
Shirt Designs
Jeremy Kuo did both the polo and baseball-T shirt designs.
