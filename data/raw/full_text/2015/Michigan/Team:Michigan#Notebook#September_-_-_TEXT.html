Work plan:
LacZ into Thrombin plasmid:
cloning not working probably because the insert is almost as big as backbone letâ€™s transform LacZ again
transform in vitro LacZ part again
plasmid is ready, digest with HindiIII and A
gel extract plasmid, measure dna concentration
LacZ into Gliadin plasmid:
Pfldh plasmid with GFP:
measure fluorescence
Things to order:
aptamer and trigger for Gliadin
switch for Gliadin with GFP (check design folder)
PfLDH protein
aptamer and trigger for Pfldh
aptamer and trigger for Kanamycin

we wanted to replicate results from previous experiment and try to detect lower thrombin concentrations to prove the sensitivity of our system
1 = Negative control (switch 1.0 + trigger-aptamer No Thrombin)
2 = Positive control (switch 1.0 + trigger)
3= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 25uM Thrombin
4= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 5uM Thrombin
5= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 2.5uM Thrombin
6= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 1.0uM Thrombin
7= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 0.5uM Thrombin
8= Switch 1.0 + trigger + aptamer + 0.1uM Thrombin
