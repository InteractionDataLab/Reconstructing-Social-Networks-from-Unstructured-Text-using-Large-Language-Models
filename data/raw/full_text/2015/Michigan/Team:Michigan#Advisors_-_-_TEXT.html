About the Michigan Synthetic Biology Team
We are the University of Michigan’s only student-run synthetic biology research and design team. Our team and project development is driven entirely by undergraduates and is separate from any faculty labs.
Advisors:
Marc Ammerlaan
Marc “MC.AMMER” Ammerlaan has been an iGEM advisor for 5 years. Marc has been essential in boosting the team's confidence when our project and experiment hit a brick wall. He is also known to comfort our team members with pizza when we are spending late nights working on the wiki.
Matt Mcguffie
Matt is a master’s student in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and helped the team brainstorm project ideas!
Anuj Kumar
Anuj Kumar is a team advisor and faculty member in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology here at Michigan where he has become a yeast guru. Known across campus for his Genetics course, Anuj is a die hard Detroit Tigers Fan and uses his old tickets as wallpaper for his office. After years of working on cellular processes in yeast, our team members can attest he is quite the FUN-GUY.
Drew Dunham
Last year’s president and this year’s advisor, despite the fact that he already graduated, he hasn’t been able to get enough of iGEM and synthetic biology so he decided to come back and help.  He provided emotional support when he was Jenn’s lab partner during the school year and taught Jeremy the ropes about funding.  What would we do without this ginger?
Adam Kreiger
Adam has worked with paper based gene networks in one of his rotations as a grad student.  He provided valuable feedback about our overarching approach.  He was also on the team when he was an undergrad at Michigan.  
In addition, we’d like to thank U of M’s Professor Allen Liu for use of his laboratory and plate reader!  Special thanks to U of M’s Professor David Sept and Professor Nils Walter for their feedback.
