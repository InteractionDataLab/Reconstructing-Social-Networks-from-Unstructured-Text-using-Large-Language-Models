Equipment and Training
All team members performing wet lab work completed University of Michigan general lab safety training and were guided on the proper use of lab materials. Lab members operating autoclaves and centrifuges were also required to complete University of Michigan autoclave and centrifuge training respectively. Gloves and long pants were worn at all times while performing lab work, and other PPE (such as safety glasses and lab coats) were worn as appropriate. In addition to the university required safety training, all members new to biology lab work were given a hands-on, guided orientation focused on proper laboratory procedures and lab safety.
Potential Hazards and Precautions
Our team took multiple steps to avoid potential biological and chemical hazards. We worked exclusively with BL1 materials such as e. coli. We also used GelRed (a safer alternative to ethidium bromide) for our gel imaging needs. The lab was kept clean and organized. E. Coli contaminated waste was treated with bleach before disposal, and biohazardous waste was disposed of appropriately.
Responsible Design
Our detection system utilizes inherently benign elements such as GFP and paper. Because of this, a final product based on our system could theoretically be shipped at room temperature without special equipment or stored for long periods of time without posing a significant environmental threat. Additionally, all major components of Aptapaper (paper, DNA template, in-vitro transcription/translation materials) can be produced biologically without the need for harsh chemical synthesis.
