Tsinghua iGEM 2015 is a warm and lovely  team. We got to be familiar with each other since this team formed in the  November of 2014. Brainstorming and inchoate experiment design divided us into  small groups in order to carry forward the project efficiently, which in  addition enabled us to exchange a lot of ideas. Though we did not stay in the  campus all the time during summer vacation, we did the experiments in turn as  well as recorded the contents and results of the experiments as detailed as  possible so that the project schedule would be kept progressing. Under this  circumstance, we tried our best to guarantee everyoneâ€™s attending the team  meeting every week by utilizing SKYPE. We think together, design together and  work together. In this way, Tsinghua iGEM 2015 team totally have faith in and  realized the spirit of iGEM that has been spread all over the world.
