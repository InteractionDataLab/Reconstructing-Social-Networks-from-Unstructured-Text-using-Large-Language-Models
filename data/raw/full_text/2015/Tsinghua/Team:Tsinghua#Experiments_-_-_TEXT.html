Plasmid DNA purification

Transfer to a 1.5mL EP tube.
Add 250uL buffer P2 and gently  mix by inverting the tube 8 times.
Add 350uL buffer P3 and  immediately mix by inverting the tube 8 times.
Centrifuge the tube for 10  minutes at 12000 rpm.
Transfer the supernatant to a  pre-balanced (by buffer BL) column.
Centrifuge the column for 60  seconds at 12000 rpm.
Remove the flow-through and add  600uL buffer PW (alcohol added).
Centrifuge the column for 60  seconds at 12000 rpm.
Repeat step 9-10.
Remove the flow-through and  centrifuge for another time.

Add 60uL ddH2O onto  the column and centrifuge for 60 seconds at 12000 rpm.

Add 1mL LB (without  antibiotics) on a germ-free bench.
Recover the bacteria by shaking  the tube for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Centrifuge (if needed) for 3  minutes at 5000 rpm and remove most of the supernatant.
Resuspend the bacteria and add  100uL suspension onto the plate with antibiotics.
Culture overnight at 37°C.
Transformation  protocol for distribution kit
Insert a tip into the well containing  plasmid of interest.
Add 10uL ddH2O and  dissolve the plasmid for 5 minutes.
Use 5uL for transformation.
Electro-transformation
Produce electroporation-competent  cells.
Add 50uL bacteria  into 100mL LB and culture at 30°C until its optical density (OD600) reaches 0.05-0.1. Then add 1mM  L-arabinose until it reaches 0.6. Place the cells on ice for 1 hour and then  wash with overnight-stored cold H2O twice and cold 10% glycerol  once. Condense 100 times and dispense 50uL into each tube. Store at -80°C.
Electro-transform 10-100ng DNA  per 50uL cells using Eporator from Eppendorf with 1mm3 electric  shock cup (Electric shock is given at 1.8kV for 4-5 seconds).
Recover the bacteria in 1mL LB  at 37°C.
Plate the bacteria on the plate  with antibiotics.
