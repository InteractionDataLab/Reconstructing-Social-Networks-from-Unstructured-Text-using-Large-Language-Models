1. Model for iPTG-inducible  ccdB expression.
(1) Given that the  concentration of CAP is stable, that is to say only to consider the negative  regulation from lac operon. Here we simply consider the influence of iPTG on  the gene expression regulated by lac operon. Therefore we can approximately  assume that the transcriptional level of mRNA is proportion to the  translational level of its protein.
(2) Since that the  expression of lacI is regulated by constitutive promoter, i. e. the  concentration of all states of lacI, including free lacI, lacI
iPTG, lacI
promoter and lacI
IPTG
promoter, are consistent. It does no harm to denote that:
(3) Provided the gene downstream  the lacI-bound operator is not expressed, whereas the gene downstream the  available operator is expressed. Denote the transcriptional level per unit time  when lac operator per unit concentration is not inhibited by lacI is mmRNA.  According to the above assumption, we know that the translational level of the  protein when the lac operator per unit concentration is not inhibited by lacI is:
(4) Since that the  concentration of the plasmid containing lac operator is constant for a period  of time, we de note the concentration as:
Besides, the concentration  of lac operator is proportional to its plasmid concentration, therefore:
(5) There are two states of lac operator, the  one bound and in turn inhibited by lacI (or lacI
iPTG) and the one unbound, the concentration of which are denoted as:
respectively.
In addition,
Therefore, the total  translational level of the protein per unit time is MmRNA:
(6) Given that lacI and  lacI
iPTG will compete for binding to lac, we can therefore deem it as two  thermal equilibrium:
Denote the equilibrium  constant
 and
, we therefore have:
Notice that because iPTG  will cause the conformation of lacI to change, and in turn significantly  inhibit its binding capacity to lac operator, we have:
Due to the above definition:
(7) The binding of lacI to  iPTG can be regarded as an equilibrium:  
Denote the equilibrium  constant as
, then:
Also denote the total  concentration of iPTG in the solution as
 
According to assumption  (2):
We can derive the  relationship between

2. Model for the  relationship between cell death and cell concentration.
3. Model for the  relationship between cell concentration and cell optical value.
