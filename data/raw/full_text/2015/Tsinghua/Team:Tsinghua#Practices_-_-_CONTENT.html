The public we targeted to  were mainly consisted of three groups listed below: students from other iGEM  teams, freshmen from the School of Life Science in Tsinghua this year and some  high school students who showed great interest in our project and daily  experiment.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="iGEM_Mini-Jamboree_.28Public_Engagement.29"><STRONG>iGEM Mini-Jamboree (Public Engagement)</STRONG></SPAN></H4><P>Freshmen major in Biology always look  forward to their research life in the future with enormous passion every year.  In the light of this statement, we held an iGEM Mini-Jamboree on September 13th,  2015.      </P><P>In addition to our telling the story of  iGEM and some previous interesting projects, we encouraged them to form several  temporary teams, which enabled them to exchange their preliminary ideas  relevant to feasible iGEM projects.</P><P>The most impressive part came when the  representative of every group shared the amazing thoughts of their discussion,  and those brave students were awarded with small souvenirs. </P> 
<P>  At last, we received many reflections  and encouragements written on the leaflet from them, which made us feel even  more hopeful when thinking about future iGEM teams representing the School of  Life Science in Tsinghua. </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lab_Visiting_.26_Experiment_Guidance_.28Education.29"><STRONG>Lab Visiting &amp; Experiment Guidance  (Education)</STRONG></SPAN></H4><P>  We decided to create a chance for high  school students to experience experiments in the lab after we got to know their  desire for practical attempt based on theoretical knowledge learned in class.  Contacted successfully on May 18th, these senior three students from  RDFZ visited the lab on May 24th for the first time.</P><P>Several days in May and June spent in the  lab with them, we introduced significant lab safety rules and basic molecular  experiments. By the time we ended this activity, they were capable of getting  positive results from a small round of experiment we designed for them. </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Attending_Conferences_.28Communication.29"><STRONG>Attending Conferences (Communication)</STRONG></SPAN></H4><P>  The 3rd iGEM conference in  Taiwan:
  Xiao Yangbo and Zhao Yiqing, two of our  team members, attended the 2015 iGEM conference held by NCTU in Taiwan from  July 19th to 24th. Serving as a “small jamboree” facing  to teams in Asia, presentations and poster introductions were given according  to different project designs as well as experiment progress. In this way,  efficient and harmonious communication between teams was realized while we got  helpful advice at the same time.     </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="CCIC.28China_Community_of_iGEM_Competition_summit.29:"><STRONG>CCIC(China Community of iGEM Competition  summit):</STRONG></SPAN></H4><P>  Five members of us also attended CCIC held  in Peking University on August 8th. We found that there were teams  working on systems similar to ours. Although we did not give a presentation at  the conference, listening to those correlated projects indeed shed light on our  work, therefore worth the participation. </P><DIV type="container" align="center"><P>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
