Part:BBa_K1797000
Blue Light Sensing System with GFP Reporter
This part is a combination of B0034-YF1-B0034-FixJ(BBa_K592016), FixK2 promoter(BBa_K592006), and amilGFP(BBa_K592010) in that order. We also add a constitutive promoter(BBa_J23119) so that teams can use this part to test the blue light system easily. When the cells are kept in dark, they will express amilGFP, a yellow chromoprotein. This protein causes the cells to have a yellow color. When the cells are exposed to blue light, the amilGFP won't be expressed and the yellow color can't be seen.
Part:BBa_K1797001
Red Light Sensing System
This part is mainly composed of Cph8(BBa_K592018), ho1(BBa_I15008) and PcyA(BBa_I15009), which form the red light sensing system in E.coli. Cph8 is a synthetic red light sensor, consisting of Cph1, a natural red light sensor, and EnvZ, a histidine kinase. The most important part of the light sensor is PCB(phycocyanobilin), without which the red light sensor cannot work. However, PCB is not generated by E.coli naturally. So we need to introduce ho1 and PcyA into E.coli. Actually we've also submitted the PCB generation system(BBa_K1797008). These two enzymes can change heme into PCB. Here we combine the three main parts- Cph8, ho1 and PcyA- together to facilitate parts users.
Part:BBa_K1797003
Blue Light Sensing System with GFP and RFP Reporter
This part is one of the many bio-bricks used to test the blue-light system in our project. Specifically, it contains an entire blue-light system, including a light sensor YF1 and a response regulator FixJ, and two Fixk2 promoter regulated reporters. We used this part to test the efficacy and efficiency of the blue-light system in E. coli. If the bacteria carrying this plasmid is provided with blue light, two reporters cannot be synthesized. On the contrary, if it is kept in dark, then the bacteria colony will display a mixture color from RFP and GFP.
Part:BBa_K1797004
Blue Light Sensing System With GFP And BFP Reporter
This part is an improved part based on BBa_K1797000. Except for the GFP reporter system, we introduced cI repressor and corresponding BFP. In the absence of blue light, GFP but not BFP will be expressed. With blue light, BFP but not GFP will be expressed.
Part:BBa_K1797008
PCB generation system
This part includes ho1 and PcyA, both of which are needed in converting heme into PCB(phycocyanobilin). PCB is an important part of the Cph1, a red light sensor. Since PCB cannot be generated naturally by E.coli. This part can be used to produce PCB and make sure the E.coli can sense red light.
Part:BBa_K1797009
Red light sensing system with mRFP reporter
This part consists of a red light sensing system(BBa_K1797001) and an RFP reporter system. When bacterial colonies are exposed to red light, the OmpR promoter is not activated, preventing the expression of RFP. When colonies are kept in dark, the corresponding transcription factor of mpR promoter is activated and RFP is expressed, making the colonies red.
