HARDWARE
Hardware: E-light 1.0
The  E-light 1.0 hardware system has 3 major components: the light-exposure & bacterial  culture system, the controlling circuit and the computer interacting port.
The  light-exposure & bacterial culture system is based on a 24-well plate  coupled with tri-color LEDs. The controlling circuit utilizes 3 AT89S52-24PU  DIP-40 SCMs (single chip microcomputer) to execute programmed-controlling of  the 24 tri-color LEDs, while the computer interacting port monitors the whole  system through given protocol sequences. The ultimate result is the  programmable operation and real-time monitoring of light-exposure (on both  timing and wave-length) on every single well.
Here below shows the appearance of our device:

Our collaborative team, Tsinghua-A, has tested our hardware device and they had a great experience. Here links to their feedback: https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua-A#collabration
Software: E-code 1.0
The  E-code 1.0 software system aims to provide convenient commanding for users of  the E-light hardware system. The software provides two operating modes: the  E.coli-code mode is able to convert any given information into light-coded  files, and therefore turn these files into actual light-exposure commands of  the E-light hardware system. With the help of the coding-plasmids from our  CRISPR-Recombinase system, we can eventually store any information into the  E.coli DNA and of course, extract the information later on through sequencing.  The self-code mode provides more flexible input options, enabling users to  program the light-exposure commands manually for every single  bacterial-culture-unit. Thus, combined with our light-switch, the user is able  to gain better control over the bacteria’s metabolism pathways.
After successfully constructing all the systems required and  confirming its efficacy, we can bridge the light-switchable TCS and the  dCas9-recombines system together. In this way, precise gene editing and  information storing can be achieved by utilizing the light system to regulate  the dCas9-recombinase hybrid.
Here below is a simple demonstration of our embedded software in the hardware:
