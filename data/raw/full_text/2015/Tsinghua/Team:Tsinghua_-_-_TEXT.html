Welcome to Tsinghua iGEM 2015!
WE AIM TO PROBE THE SECRET OF LIFE AND INFORMATION
THEN WE HAVE EMAGE
IMAGE OF LIFE AND WORLD
Perspective from an iGEM veteran (Yue Liu):
Information storage using  biological systems has been considered as a development trend with great potential, based on the amazing fact that simple nucleotides like ATCG could encode exquisite living organisms that are far more delicate than any of the machines in this world. I was very impressed when first hearing about iGEM 2015 Tsinghua’s idea of E-mage, which smartly applied visible lights as information input and modified DNA sequences as read out. I think this concept  is innovative, and along with the great advances in photobiology, the precise, low-cost and noninvasive nature of light will render it to be powerful tools in bio-info storage.
I noticed that the team has put great efforts into preliminary work that set up parameters and adjusted the models, which required much  engineering principles. And the E-hardware and software parts are what distinguished their project from traditional biology projects. Their wiki website provides details about their work and it will be better if more figures and schemas could be shown.
As a previous member of iGEM 2014 Tsinghua team, I can understand the difficult moments they have went through and I’m very glad to see they are such a warm team that can think together, work together and grow together. Good Luck, Tsinghua Team!
