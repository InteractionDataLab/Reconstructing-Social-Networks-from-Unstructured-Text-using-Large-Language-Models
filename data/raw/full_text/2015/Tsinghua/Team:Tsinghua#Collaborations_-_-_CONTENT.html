We had enjoyable collaboration with team  SJTU, SYSU and Tsinghua A. 
  During our initial seek for an idea project, SJTU  provided us several plasmids containing the light system because they have used  similar proteins before. Apart from sharing similar parts with them, we also  invited two students from SJTU to Tsinghua University for a visit when they  came to Beijing in August. They said that they had a good time in the campus  and looked forward to better cooperation with us. 
  We are also grateful that SYSU later began to  collaborate with us after a conference in Taiwan. They kindly shared their  plasmids encoding recombinase with us. Besides this, we also held a meet-up in  Beijing in August, during which we not only discussed the technical obstacles  we encountered before but also shared useful tips for later experiments. As an  exchange, we spotted out several wrong description or sequencing errors in  their plasmids, which at first might be misleading. 
  The collaboration with Tsinghua-A was a bit late,  but of great help to us â€“ we provided them a hardware prototype and asked for  their advices, and indeed they provided us very useful feedbacks. Besides,  their senior advisor pointed out a potential problem for us. As the only two  iGEM teams in our university this year, we believe this collaboration is  necessary. </P><P>Feedback from Tsinghua-A IGEM team on the usage of our hardware can be found here: <A rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua-A#collabration">https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua-A#collabration</A></P><DIV type="container" align="center"><P>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
