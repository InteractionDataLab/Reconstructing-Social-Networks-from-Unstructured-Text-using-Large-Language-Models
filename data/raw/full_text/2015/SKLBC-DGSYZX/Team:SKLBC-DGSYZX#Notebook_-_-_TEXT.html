Team founded
Our team set up on April 19th, 2015. We are voluntary to join our team and each of us plays an important role in the team.
Take the training
We took training every week under the help of instructors. During the training, we learn more about synthetic biology and improve our skills of debate and speech. We also develop good habits and explore methods to carry on scientific research.
Choose the project
In the beginning, we knew more information about igem from our insructors and then after discussion and brain-storming we came up with the idea of our project.
