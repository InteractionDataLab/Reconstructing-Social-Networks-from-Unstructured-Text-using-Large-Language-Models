Software Design
The group for programming takes charge of our website and forum’s construction, administration and maintenance. They use JavaScript and GoJS to build up the skeleton of our project and the carry on the further improvement of the project.
Visual Effect
The group for design is in charge of the whole design process of the website, from the size of the words and the color of the page, to the design of the team mascot and poster. It works as the artist to make sure that all work is on display at the best visual effect
Tutorial
In order to make it easier from learner to master the use of Synsketch, we design a tutorial for the users. Actually, it’s a brilliant idea which helps us learn synthetic biology easily and save time at the same time. With the help of tutorial, users can learn how to use the software tool within 15mins, only the time to make a cup of coffee. And teachers will also have materials to expand the usage of Synsketch among high school and university students who show an interest in synthetic biology and who want to participate in iGEM competitions.
