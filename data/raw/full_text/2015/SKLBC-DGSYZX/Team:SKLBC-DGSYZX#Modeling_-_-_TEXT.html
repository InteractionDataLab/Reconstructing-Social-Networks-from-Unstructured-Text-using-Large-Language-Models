As high school team with the BEST SOFTWARE TOO prize in iGEM 2014 HS, our team continues to focus on developing software to help iGEMers carry on their experiments and focuses more on software. However, we also carry on fundamental lab experiments for students to enjoy the iGEM research-based learning. We hope the judges can evaluate our project according to the software medal criteria instead of the high school medal criteria. The abstract of our project, Synsketch is mentioned below: Genetic circuits play a significant role in IGEM experiment. However, the diversity in styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs iGEMers lots of time to complete a standardized genetic circuits by using the current graphic design tool. After collaborating with and learning from university wet teams, we get the inspiration to develop a cloud-based tool-- Synsketch-- to design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently, which is easy to learn, modify and share, therefore helping iGEMers to save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit. With other additional functions like personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public. We further develop it into a free innovative educational tool for personalized learning in synthetic biology. As a result, with combination of education and business model, we manage to create a genetic circuits design tool and bring iGEM to everyone and everywhere.
