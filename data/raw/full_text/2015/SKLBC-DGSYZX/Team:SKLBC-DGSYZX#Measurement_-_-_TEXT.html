As high school team with the BEST SOFTWARE TOO prize in iGEM 2014 HS, our team continues to focus on developing software to help iGEMers carry on their experiments and focuses more on software. However, we also carry on fundamental lab experiments for students to enjoy the iGEM research-based learning. We hope the judges can evaluate our project according to the software medal criteria instead of the high school medal criteria.
