Safety
We have already received safe training and Yishun Zhang is responsible for the safety of biology labs. (The guideline for laboratory biosafety is soeasy.sysu.edi.cn/dela/up;padfiles/201541093923332.doc.)
The experiment is only for the students to enjoy the iGEM research-based learning. It is foundational and only used in lab with little effected on the real world. So there is no risk at the lab stage.
Since miR-397 is only targeted to plants, they are safe for both human being and domestic animals.
