There are three key words that best descried her. The first one is ‘life science lover’. The interest of biochemistry and the concerns for all living creatures lead her onto the load of life science and she will follow it firmly in the future. The second is ‘MUNer’. The two-year experience of MUN not only improves her speech skills but also develops her ability to solve problems. The third is ‘team player’. She is gregarious and understands the importance of team work. She always tries to find the place most fit her in the team.</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 row_1"><H2 class="xingming">Xiaolei Quan</H2><H3>I’m studying in Syracuse, America.

            The advanced science thories like relativity and quantum mechanics  attracts me, despite this, after years of brain storming, I have got the idea that the basis of the human research is that we want to have a better life, and therefore, a better world. Nowadays, the earth is facing the great problem of global warming and many other problems. In order to make the world be better, we must secure the bottom line of our survival-----food and inhabitable environment, which has a lot to do with the synthetic biology.
            These days, our natural environment is exacerbating, and the development in the space exploration is not enough ------as said in Interstellar, the nearest star is 1000 years away, it is going to take us forever to get there. So it will be a good idea making our planet better instead of  finding another better planet.
            After a few times of learning, I get to know that the brand new branch of the biology-------synthetic biology is the key to make our Earth better. The development of synthetic biology is swift once it was founded, the era which artificial biological system research dominates is coming. The revolution is coming, a better world is coming.</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 row_1"><H2 class="xingming">Hongyu Duan</H2><H3>Hey，my name is Hongyu Duan,from GuangDong Experimental High School,GuangZhou,china.As a member of SkLBC-GDSYZX,I am pround to join in this compitetion.I love music,films and things like that.Thank you for your support.</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 row_1"><H2 class="xingming">Zhijie Luo</H2><H3>Hello everyone ,my name is Luo Zhijie.
