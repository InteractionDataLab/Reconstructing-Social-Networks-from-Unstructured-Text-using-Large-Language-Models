Description
Genetic circuits play a significant role in IGEM experiment. However, the diversity in styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs iGEMers lots of time to complete a standardized genetic circuits by using the current graphic design tool. After collaborating with and learning from university wet teams, we get the inspiration to develop a cloud-based tool-- Synsketch-- to design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently,which is easy to learn, modify and share, therefore helping iGEMers to save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit. With other additional functions like personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public. We further develop it into a free innovative educational tool for personalized learning in synthetic biology. As a result, with combination of education and business model, we manage to create a genetic circuits design tool and bring iGEM to everyone and everywhere.
Background
We start IGEM but have difficulties understanding flow charts about experiment principle of different styles.
After collaborating with and learning from university students,we have found that they also have the same problems.
Then we did a survey: the average time to finish a flow chart is 30 minutes.
It took quite much time for iGEMers to design a flow chart,so we had the inspiration to develop a tool about standardization, adaptation and interaction.
And during human practice,we discovered a commercial model to combine synthetic biology and education agencies and also get constant investment.
Here comes our project----Synsketch.
What is Synsketch?
iGEM-SKLBC-GDSYZX is a high school team which is sponsered by one of the State Key Laboratory for Bio Control in SYSU.Our team members are all biology lovers from Guangdong Experimental High School.In our team,everyone tries his/her best to perform his/her own function.All of us are really happy to have the opportunity to take part in the iGEM and we will do all we can to present a wonderful iGEM journey.
How to use Synsketch?
Synsketch is really easy to use.If a person want to use Synsketch to design a genetic circuit,he or she needn’t to be technical.He or she just need to click the element(For example:RBS) and then drag it to a proper place.After combining all the elements in a picture,a genetic circuit is finished.Besides,for those who begin to use Synsketch for the first time,we have prepared an illustrated course to help them understand Synsketch quickly.
Other functions
In addition to the functions of designing genetic circuits,Synsketch also has many other functions which are user-friendly:
Personal account----manage your own genetic circuits
News pushing----know current news about synthetic biology
Resource recommendation----gain some knowledge
Helpful tags----help manage and classify
Item analysis----broaden your horizon
Multiple interactions----iGEM whenever and wherever
Why Synsketch?
Synsketch is a tool of standardization,adaption and interaction.We create Synsketch on the purpose of using and supporting existing synthetic biology standards.Synsketch provide a standardized model for people to design genetic circuits both quickly and efficiently.If Synsketch is successfully promoted among iGEM community,we will get unified visual effect.That will strengthen synthetic biology standards.For synthetic biology platforms,we build up Synsketch community.Synthetic biology lovers can use our Synsketch community as a platform to show their discoveries as well as communicate about their problems.In conclusion,Synsketch tool and Synsketch community effectively use and support exist synthetic biology standards and platforms.
Synsketch promotion
We successfully held several offline promotion activities and understood the needs and problems of the target customers.These valuable experience helped us perfect our project as well as promote synthetic biology.We also built up a viable business model and have got 100,000RMB from our sponsors.
