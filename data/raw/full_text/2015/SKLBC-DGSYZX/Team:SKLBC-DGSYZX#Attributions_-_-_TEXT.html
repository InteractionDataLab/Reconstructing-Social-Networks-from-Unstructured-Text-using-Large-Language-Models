Academic information
Jingtong Zhao,Xinming Liu,Hongxu Lin,Junhao Zhao,Zhijie Luo
The group for collect content reads and analyzes lots of pervious IGEM projects and translate s them into Chicness (and other languages if possible). Therefore, it is much more convenient for other IGEM community to learn from their ancestors and about what they have done in the past.
  Other member who joined the team and learned together: ZhiQuan Zhu, Zhiyuan Dai, Hongjun Lin, Kaibin Gao, HanNan Liu, HaoJun Chen, Yang Xu, Shushen Chen, YiZhen Yang, MingJun Deng

A Few Words About Us
Jingtong Zhao
She is a Grade ten student from Guangdong Experimental High School.She likes skating,reading and sudoku.Her favourite subjects are biology and physics.IGEM is a wonderful platform for her as well as many other biology lovers.She will try her best to be a good member of SKLBC-GDSYZX.
Haohua Liu
Hi, I’m Liu Haohua, the lead programmer of team SKLBC-GDSYZX. Interested in IT and internet, I have learned programming languages such as PHP, Javascript and so on. It’s also enjoyable for me to learn biology. I am looking forward to learning more about CS and SE. Moreover, swimming is my favourite sport!
Siyi Wang
She is now studying in Boston, America. As an old student of Guangdong Experimental High school, it's really a great honor to work with her friends again. iGEM is a fantastic place for us to strengthen our abilities and hope we can enjoy it!
Zifeng Huang
Hi, I'm Huang Zifeng. Having fun is my hobby. I like playing badminton with my friends. I am so glad to be in IGEM that offers me so much fun, oportunities and experiences. The best part of IGEM is that I can meet a lot of friends from all over the world and gain a wonderful experience.
Junhao Zhao
I am 16 years old and a student in Guangdong Experimental High School. I am the Director general of the Association Union, which is a student organization that supervises all the Associations in our school , and also ran JA company during my school time. I spend most of my spare in learning knowledge of advanced technology and synthetic biology. Besides, I have the ability to speak English, Cantonese, German and a little Japanese, which enable me to communicate with more people around the globe. I think I am a good team player and I am a person of great honesty to others.
Xinming Liu
Xinming is a Grade Eleven student from Guangdong Experimental High School. There are three key words that best descried her. The first one is ‘life science lover’. The interest of biochemistry and the concerns for all living creatures lead her onto the load of life science and she will follow it firmly in the future. The second is ‘MUNer’. The two-year experience of MUN not only improves her speech skills but also develops her ability to solve problems. The third is ‘team player’. She is gregarious and understands the importance of team work. She always tries to find the place most fit her in the team.
Xiaolei Quan
I’m studying in Syracuse, America. As an old student of Guangdong Experimental High School, it’s really a great honor to fight with my friends again. IGEM is a dream stage for all of us, I hope we can make an achievement in this competition!
Jiale Li
I’m the senior one student from Guangzhou Experimental High School. I'm fond of biology and I have a inquiring mind . I enjoy the combination of science, art and technology when participate in the IGEM team this year and I learn a lot from the process. It’s truly an meaningful experience for me.
Hongxu Lin
I am from the Guangdong Experimental High School, due to the enthusiasm for the cutting-edge scientific researches,I am currently taking part in the igem 2015.
The advanced science thories like relativity and quantum mechanics  attracts me, despite this, after years of brain storming, I have got the idea that the basis of the human research is that we want to have a better life, and therefore, a better world. Nowadays, the earth is facing the great problem of global warming and many other problems. In order to make the world be better, we must secure the bottom line of our survival-----food and inhabitable environment, which has a lot to do with the synthetic biology.
These days, our natural environment is exacerbating, and the development in the space exploration is not enough ------as said in Interstellar, the nearest star is 1000 years away, it is going to take us forever to get there. So it will be a good idea making our planet better instead of  finding another better planet.
After a few times of learning, I get to know that the brand new branch of the biology-------synthetic biology is the key to make our Earth better. The development of synthetic biology is swift once it was founded, the era which artificial biological system research dominates is coming. The revolution is coming, a better world is coming.
