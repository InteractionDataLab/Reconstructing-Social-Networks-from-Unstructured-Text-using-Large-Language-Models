Abstract
Genetic circuits play a significant role in IGEM experiment. However, the diversity in styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs iGEMers lots of time to complete a standardized genetic circuits by using the current graphic design tool. After collaborating with and learning from university wet teams, we get the inspiration to develop a cloud-based tool-- Synsketch-- to design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently,which is easy to learn, modify and share, therefore helping iGEMers to save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit. With other additional functions like personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public. We further develop it into a free innovative educational tool for personalized learning in synthetic biology. As a result, with combination of education and business model, we manage to create a genetic circuits design tool and bring iGEM to everyone and everywhere.
Background
Nowadays iGEM has become more and more popular, the official website has attracted more and more people. But when people surf the iGEM’s official website, they run into trouble:
Many iGEMers may find it difficult to design a clear genetic circuit.
People who are interested in synthetic biology experiments are confused about some genetic circuits because they are too difficult to understand.
Some Chinese readers cannot well understand the all-English articles.
It's not convenient enough for users to find out a project through thousands of projects in the website.
We cannot find out the information about biobrick both quickly and accurately.
It will be better if we can store up or comment on some interesting projects.
Many synthetic biology lovers cannot get a clear connection among various biobricks.
Experiment teams have troubles in analyze their experimental data.
......
We summarize their problems, these problems can be classified as three aspects: for iGEMers, for biology lovers and for the public .In order to help people solve their problems as well as popularize iGEM, our team decided to begin our project----Synsketch.

Synsketch
Many iGEMers meet some difficulties such as drawing flow diagrams of experiment,searching for biobricks,analyze others’ experiments and so on.So we build up a new function for them----Synsketch.Synsketch is an online drawing board that can effectively help iGEMers draw clear and standardized flow diagrams of experiment.IGEMers can use this tool to consummate their projects.
Synsketch’s functions
As a revolutionary tool,Synsketch has many wonderful functions which make iGEMers work more conveniently and effectively.
Design your own genetic circuit: Synsketch can help users draw clear and standardized genetic circuits. They just need to pitch on the design elements they want and then drag it to a suitable place, a clear picture is occurring.
Save genetic circuits: After finishing drawing a drawing flow diagram of experiment users can save it in two different ways. Users can download it to their computer and save it. Or they can sign up and then store it up permanently in their personal account.
Share it quickly: As a genetic circuit is finished,a QR code is generated. Users can share their QR code to friends.
Prefix and suffix: Find it boring to add a prefix or a suffix to a biobrick?Don't worry,Synsketch can help users add prefixes and suffixes. That help people save a lot of time.
Learn more about parts: The most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts. A brief introduction will emerge if the mouse moves over a part on the genetic circuit. And users can view the detailed information about it by double-clicking the part. Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by one. And the data base, the iGEM official website, is of great authentic credibility.
Synsketch’s highlight
Standardization: Make a comprehensive survey on various genetic circuits, we find that they are not uniform: some are too complex, some are too simple, some are confused and some are incomplete...So we decide to make Synsketch in order to establish a unified standard. Synsketch is a standardized tool that helps iGEMers draw clear and unified flow diagrams of experiment. If every team uses Synsketch to draw flow diagrams of experiment, we will get a unified visual effect.So that flow diagrams of experiment will not be obscure,people can understand all the experimental principle easily.
Adaptation: With Synsketch, you don’t need to start from lines when you want to draw your own genetic circuits. Just pitch on the design elements you want and then drag it to a suitable place, a standardized picture is completed. So the only thing you should do is to combine the basic elements according to the experimental principle. In this way you can reduce the risk of making mistake. Also,if you make a mistake, Synsketch is available for you to revise your picture both quickly and accurately. Synsketch is a really useful tool which is easy to learn and easy to use.
Instrcution: the most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts. Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by one. And the data base, the iGEM official website, is of great authentic credibility.
Future development
Synsketch is a really useful tool,it has a wide developmental foreground.At the present stage,Synsketch is a characteristic feature of our website.But it is available to develop Synsketch into a independent application.We will improve it's existing functions and then gain more useful new functions.
off-line:We will try to make our Synsketch independent from our website,so we will develop offline service.So that you don't need to connect to the Internet.You can use Synsketch whenever and wherever.
Synsketch community:We will build up the Synsketch Community in order to make it more convenient to share your pictures as well as communicate about your problems.Synsketch is a platform for iGEMers to learn more about drawing pictures.
And later we can publish the Synsketch to the application store such as App Store,Google Play,Windows Store and so on.
Other basic function of Synsketch website
create personal account
By creating the account, user is able to store up articles or videos that he is interested in and even share them with friends through various social networks. During the information era, it’s a trend to communicate through the Internet. So the personal account of our website will establish a social network among iGEM lovers around the world.
select language
By using a language library, our website is able to select language so that users are easy to understand some difficult terminologies. Not only has our website now achieved the bilingual to facilitate Chinese users, but also will we work on to make further improvements to include other languages such as Germany, Japanese and so on.
view the recommendatory books and videos
On the front page of the website, there is a regular recommendation for books and websites. IGEM lovers and synthetic biology learners will find that useful to view the recommendatory materials.
use tags and key words to search
All the articles and analyses about previous objects are well classified by tags so that users can simply type the key words in the searching box, press the search bottom, and get all the information with the same key words. Tags will save a lot of time for users to look through large amount of information to finally get what they really want.
see mind map of biobricks
For every article about previous projects, there is a mind map about all the biobricks involved in the projects, which demonstrates the specific function and usage of biobricks. Usually it takes readers lots of time to go through the all passage about the project to understand the function of biobricks and the method about how they link together. However, with the help of mind map, users will have a clear recognition of the whole process and can learn more about the basic information of biobricks.
Brief introduction of forum
The forum, closely connected with the website, is a platform for iGEM lovers to communicate. They can share both their problems during the research process and their new discoveries in the field of synthetic biology. And during the communication, the whole iGEM community is able to establish a close link. Through the process of asking and answering, those who first step in the door of synthetic biology can get lots of help from the professors of the field and have the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of their ancestors.
Features
User-friendly
Synsketch is user-friendly because the powerful language library will help users to overcome the language barrier and provide users with better understanding of those academic papers. And the site map will offer a clear navigation for users and make even those who use the website for the first time to sign up and look for information easily.
Useful
Both the website and forum are very useful for IGEM lovers and those who major in or teach biology. For academic researchers, the tags help to classify the contents and make it easy to find the exact information; and the mind map about biobricks will offer a necessary tool for researchers when they are working on an IGEM project. For the public, the recommendations for relevant books and videos will definitely open up their eyes to the mysterious and amazing world of biology; and the forum is a useful way for them to get information and help from the academic researchers or professors. So our project is basically useful for both academic researchers and ordinary public.
Universal
By having a brief view about the previous IGEM projects and communicating through the forum, the IGEM lovers and synthetic biology researchers have a platform to get, give and share—just as the motif of IGEM mentioned. It is a universal chance to establish connection with the whole IGEM community. And such chance is what makes the community become closer and closer and promotes the influence of IGEM among more and more people.
