However, the diversity in styles of circuits not only hinders learners of synthetic biology, but also costs iGEMers lots of time to complete a standardized genetic circuits by using the current graphic design tool. After collaborating with and learning from university wet teams, we get the inspiration to develop a cloud-based tool-- Synsketch-- to design a standardized genetic circuit easily and efficiently,which is easy to learn, modify and share, therefore helping iGEMers to save lots of time creating a standardized genetic circuit. With other additional functions like personal account, multi-language interface and well-classified tags, Synsketch is able to inspire scientific curiosity among the public. We further develop it into a free innovative educational tool for personalized learning in synthetic biology. As a result, with combination of education and business model, we manage to create a genetic circuits design tool and bring iGEM to everyone and everywhere. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="about_box3 title" style="background-color:#ff6699" id="background"><H3 class="m_1"><SPAN>Background</SPAN></H3><DIV class="container"><DIV class="grid_3"><P style="margin-top:30px;">Nowadays iGEM has become more and more popular, the official website has attracted more and more people.

They just need to pitch on the design elements they want and then drag it to a suitable place, a clear picture is occurring.</LI><LI class="promble">Save genetic circuits: After finishing drawing a drawing flow diagram of experiment users can save it in two different ways. Users can download it to their computer and save it. Or they can sign up and then store it up permanently in their personal account.</LI><LI class="promble">Share it quickly: As a genetic circuit is finished,a QR code is generated. Users can share their QR code to friends.</LI><LI class="promble">Prefix and suffix: Find it boring to add a prefix or a suffix to a biobrick?Don't worry,Synsketch can help users add prefixes and suffixes. That help people save a lot of time.</LI><LI class="promble">Learn more about parts: The most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts. A brief introduction will emerge if the mouse moves over a part on the genetic circuit. And users can view the detailed information about it by double-clicking the part. Such function save lots of time for users to look for information about all parts involved in a genetic circuit one by one. And the data base, the iGEM official website, is of great authentic credibility.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="about_box3 title" id="forum" style="background-color:#66cccc"><H3 class="m_1"><SPAN>Synsketch’s highlight</SPAN></H3><DIV class="container"><DIV class="grid_3 syn"><UL><LI class="promble">Standardization: Make a comprehensive survey on various genetic circuits, we find that they are not uniform: some are too complex, some are too simple, some are confused and some are incomplete...So we decide to make Synsketch in order to establish a unified standard. Synsketch is a standardized tool that helps iGEMers draw clear and unified flow diagrams of experiment. If every team uses Synsketch to draw flow diagrams of experiment, we will get a unified visual effect.So that flow diagrams of experiment will not be obscure,people can understand all the experimental principle easily.</LI><LI class="promble">Adaptation: With Synsketch, you don’t need to start from lines when you want to draw your own genetic circuits. Just pitch on the design elements you want and then drag it to a suitable place, a standardized picture is completed. So the only thing you should do is to combine the basic elements according to the experimental principle. In this way you can reduce the risk of making mistake. Also,if you make a mistake, Synsketch is available for you to revise your picture both quickly and accurately. Synsketch is a really useful tool which is easy to learn and easy to use.</LI><LI class="promble">Instrcution: the most educative part about Synsketch is that all the genetic circuits designed by Synsktech include a direct link to the iGEM official data base about the information of synthetically parts.
