We are programming a phage resistant Lactococcus lactis to protect your cheese!

Abstract
The cheese industry generates billions of dollars each year, and no wonder—cheese is delicious! One of the greatest difficulties that the cheese industry faces is bacteriophage (virus) infection, which kills bacteria used in the manufacture of cheese. The industry utilizes a variety of approaches to deal with this problem, each having their own drawbacks. The 2015 USU iGEM team is implementing a synthetic biology approach to design and create phage resistant Lactococcus lactis, a commonly-used cheese starter bacteria. The genetic mechanism behind this phage resistance functions by pairing a promoter that is activated in the presence of phage with a kill switch to terminate infected cells before phage are able to propagate.
