BBa_K1820014
This part was designed as a green fluorescent protein generator to provide a proof of concept for the ability to transform and express different genes in Lactococcus lactis.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K2033220 – Constitutive promoter from 2013 Uppsala team
B0034 – Ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency
K1365020 – Super-folded green fluorescent protein (GFP) from 2014 Groningen team
B0015 – Composite part of two transcriptional terminators
BBa_K1820019
This part was designed as a red fluorescent protein generator to provide a proof of concept for the ability to transform and express different genes in L. lactis.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K1033225 – Constitutive promoter from 2013 Uppsala team
B0034 – Ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency
K1033250 – mCherry (a red fluorescent protein, RFP) from 2013 Uppsala team
B0015 - Composite part of two transcriptional terminators
BBa_K1820020
This part was constructed as a phage inducible green fluorescent protein generator to detect the presence of phage within a Lactococcus lactis culture. Refer to our project page for background information on phage infection in L. lactis cheese cultures and to our design page on how our system works.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K1820001- Composite part of K180000 (phage-inducible promoter) and B0034 (a ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency)
K1365020 – Super-folded green fluorescent protein (GFP) from 2014 Groningen team
B0015 - Composite part of two transcriptional terminators
BBa_K1820021
