TEAM: Together Everyone Achieves More.
Yale University and University of La Verne
As iGEM grows, the interest in non-model organisms (organisms other than "E. coli") has started to increase. Since our team decided to work with "Lactococcus lactis" this year, we were one of a few teams that were working with a non-model organism. Because of this, Yale and ULV reached out to us to find out about our experiences with this particular organism, as they wanted to create a handbook for other teams interested in these organisms. In conjunction with Yale, University of La Verne, Concordia University, Cornell University, Northeastern University, and University of British Columbia, a guidebook has been created (courtesy of the Yale and ULV teams) that contains a set of considerations for those teams that are interested in working with non-model organisms. As a team, we felt that it was really important for other teams to have this resource, thus this collaboration should be very beneficial for the iGEM community. Check out the guidebook here!
Stanford-Brown
Members of our team were asked for advice from the 2015 Stanford-Brown iGEM team because of our reputation working with bioplastics, specifically polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Fortunately, we were able to arrange an in-person meeting with their team over the summer. We provided help by answering questions regarding the feasibility of their project, troubleshooting issues with low yields of bioplastic, as well as proposing routes to take in order to achieve their goals. The Stanford-Brown students were very receptive and went one step further by inquiring about our project, bringing up key points that allowed us to see an outside perspective on how our project would be received. This meeting proved to be mutually beneficial and we look forward to seeing how their project has progressed at the Jamboree!
