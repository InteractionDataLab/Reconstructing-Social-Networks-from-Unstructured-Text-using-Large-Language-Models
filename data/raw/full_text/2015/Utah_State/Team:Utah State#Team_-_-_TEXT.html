The people who made it happen.
Alex Torgesen
Alex Torgesen is a senior in biological engineering pursuing a minor in crop biotechnology.  He plans to eventually become involved with genetically engineering crops.  He works at the research greenhouses at USU where he is involved in projects on the light requirements of plants for NASA and the benefits of the addition of ribose in hydroponics.  His interests include spending time outside hiking and skiing, reading, playing videogames, and building puzzles.
Sara Gertsch
Sara is currently finishing up her Bachelor's in Biological Engineering with minors in Chemistry and Business this fall. This is her second year participating in the iGEM competition. She has thoroughly enjoyed her experience in the field of synthetic biology and hopes to continue pursuing her interests in this field, particularly gaining more experience with yeast. Outside of the lab, she enjoys her many fitness classes, participating and teaching Zumba, tubing down the river with friends, and hanging out with family.
Chad Nielsen
Chad Nielsen is a senior in Biological Engineering with minors in Chemistry and Crop Biotechnology at Utah State University. He has worked as a fermentation technician at USU’s USTAR Innovation Center, as a research assistant under Dr. Ron Sims in the USU Biofuel and Bioproducts Production from Microalgae project, and has also worked under Dr. Charles Miller in USU’s Cellular Engineering Lab. Chad is a member of the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society and has contributed to work published in the academic journal "Algae Research." Outside of his interest in science and engineering, his main hobbies include ringing English handbells in a local bell choir; spending time with his wife, family, and friends; gardening; and reading and writing about Mormon history and theology.
Michael Paskett
Michael Paskett is a junior majoring in biological engineering. He was born and raised in American Fork, Utah and is the oldest of 4 children. He spent two years on an LDS mission to South Korea and enjoys studying and speaking Korean alongside his schoolwork. Michael plays rugby at Utah State University and loves spending time outdoors – whether it be playing sports, rock climbing, or camping. Michael plans on continuing his education in neurosciences with the dream of furthering research and development of neuroprosthetics.
Alexander Cook
A sophomore studying Biological Engineer. This is his first year involved with iGEM, he also works at Dr. Lewis' lab researching synthetic spider silk development.  He dreams of being a Biomedical Engineer to further the work done in Medical devices.
Timothy Kerns
Timothy Kerns is a junior in the biological engineering program at USU. This is his first year participating on the iGEM team. Tim believes that genetically modified organisms are a potential means for sustaining and improving life. He desires to work in the biotech industry to enhance life. He enjoys playing golf, target shooting, and spending time with his family.
Ryan Putman
Ryan is finishing his Bachelor’s in Biological Engineering this fall. His hobbies include football, basketball, and chess.
Chase Spencer
Chase is a senior finishing his degree in Biological Engineering with a minor in Chemistry at USU. His current work is 3D printing synthetic spider silk to make highly biocompatible and resorbable implants. Chase also loves backpacking and mountain biking in the beautiful Bear River Mountain Range. The color of his toothbrush is purple and he loves trying exotic foods.
Thomas Overbeck
Tom obtained his undergraduate degree in microbiology, and is currently pursuing his PhD in Nutrition, Dietetics, and Food Sciences at Utah State University. His research interest are in lactic acid bacteria genetics and physiology, and production of renewable organic chemicals. Outside of the lab he enjoys hiking and backpacking, fly fishing, and traveling to new places.
