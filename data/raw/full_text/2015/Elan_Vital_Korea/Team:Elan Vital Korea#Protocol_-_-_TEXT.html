QIAGEN® Plasmid Mini and Midi Kits
Notes before starting
1. Add RNase A solution to Buffer P1, mix, and store at 2-8°C
2. Optional: Add LyseBlue® reagent to Buffer P1 at a ratio of 1:1000.
3. Prechill Buffer P3 at 4°C. Check Buffer P2 for SDS precipitation
4. Isopropanol and 70% ethanol are required.
5. Symbols: ● QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit; ■ QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit
1. Harvest overnight bacterial culture by centrifuging at 6000 x g for 15 mins at 4°C.
2. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in ● 0.3ml or ■ 4ml Buffer P1.
3. Add ● 0.3ml or ■ 4ml Buffer P2, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4-6 times, and incubate at room temperature (1525°C) for 5 mins. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn blue.
4. Add ● 0.3ml or ■ 4 ml prechilled Buffer P3, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4-6times. Incubate on ice for ● 5 mins or ■ 15 mins. If using LyseBlue reagent, mix the solution until it is colorless.
5. ●: Centrifuge at 14,000-18,000 x g for 10 mins at 4°C. Re-centrifuge if supernatant is not clear ■: Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 30 mins at 4°C. Re-centrifuge the super natant at 20,000 x g for 15 mins at 4°C
6. Equlibriate a QIAGEN tip ● 20 or ■ 100 by applying ● 1ml or ■ 4ml Buffer QBT, and allow column to empty by gravity flow.
7. Apply these supernatant from step 5 to the QIAGEN tip and allow it to enter the resin by gravity flow.
8. Was the QIAGEN top with ● 2 x 2 ml or ■ 2 x10 ml Buffer QC. Allow Buffer QC to move through the QIAGEN top by gravity flow.
9. Elute DNA with ● 0.8 ml or ■ 5 ml Buffer QF into a clean ● 2 ml or ■ 15 ml vessel. For constructs larger than 45 kb, prewarming the elution buffer to 65°C may help to increase the yield.
10. Precipitate DNA by adding ● 0.56 ml or ■ 3.5 ml room temperature isopropanol to the eluted DNA and mix. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 30 mins at 4°C. Carefully decant the supernatant.
11. Wash the DNA pellet with ● 1 ml or ■ 2ml room temperature 70% ethanol and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 10 mins. Carefully decant the supernatant.
12. Air dry pellet for 5-10 mins and redissolve DNA in a suitable volume of  appropriate buffer (e.g., TE buffer, pH 8.0, or 10 mM TrisCl, pH 8.5).
