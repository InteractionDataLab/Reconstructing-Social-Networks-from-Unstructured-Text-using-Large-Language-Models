Korea University iGEM Team
Elan Vital was not a pre-existing high school team. It was an alliance of students who were passionate about science.
We would like to thank the members and parents not only for the weekly meetings throughout the year,
but also for their consistent support, effort, and devotion of their time to make this iGEM dream into a reality
We thank and send grateful acknowledgements to all others involved in helping us to be a successful iGEM team
