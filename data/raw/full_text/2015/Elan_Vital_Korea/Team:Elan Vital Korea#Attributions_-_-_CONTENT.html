Special Thanks to <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Professor You-Jin Hwang </SPAN>, PI of Elan Vital Korea, who shared our belief of what we can do, and generously allowed us to use his lab, materials and other resources we needed.  He has been very supportive and understanding all the time, and offered invaluable advices whenever we needed them. 

And, we cannot thank <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Dr. Jeffrey Hannah </SPAN>, our instructor, enough, however we tried.  He flew all the way to Korea and stayed with us for more than a week for brainstorming and valuable lectures on the fundamentals of synthetic biology for more than 80 hours.  He also opened our eyes on quorum sensing: what it is and what it can do. Our project idea is the brainchild of his works, contributions and guidance.  He led us to the idea, and directed our lab works throughout all processes. <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Mr. Yeosung Moon and Ms Minji Lee </SPAN> helped us greatly as lab coaches.  Often, they had to sacrifice their freedom to stay with us, supervise and teach us lab techniques, and share their valuable experiences.  

The following companies sponsored our works: <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> TSST Global, Thinkware Dashcam, Tannus, and Daedong Paper.</SPAN>  They helped us greatly reaching out to the community.  They generously helped us with funds for video creation and their products which we gave to visitors of our booth as gifts.  <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> YMCA </SPAN> supported our project as our umbrella and guardian.  Without their help, we would not have been able to participate in the Korea Youth Expo.  Also they lend us their extensive network for our public awareness activities. <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Mr. Sungchul Yoo </SPAN> , Secretary General of Korean Science Teacher Association, kindly distributed our information materials and videos to science teachers across Korea. <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Mr. Chee Ho Yoon </SPAN> of Royal College of Art helped us to build an excellent team wiki with his artistic inspiration, devotion and years of experience. 

Video editing and animation creation skills of
<SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Ms Heyeon Shim, Chaelyn Lee, Sodooeeeee </SPAN> (pen name, of course) have been invaluable for our videos. <SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> Hotel Lotte </SPAN> kindly offered wonderful banquet and excellent ballroom for our regional meet-up.<SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> June Kwon,</SPAN> Young Chan Kimâ€™s mother, shared her past iGEM experience and served as a team secretary until we were able to stand on our feet.  And, last but not least, we have been greatly indebted to
<SPAN style="font-size:22px;"> our parents </SPAN> whose financial and emotional support and inspiration made it all possible.  Thank you all; you made it all possible!</P></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
