I.Agarose gel(CLICK)
We often use 0.7%,1% and 1.5% agarose gel, take 0.7% agarose gel for example:
1. Weigh 0.175 g of agarose.
2. Add 25 mL of TAE 1X.
3. Heat up until the solution is homogeneous, avoiding boiling. If it boils, move away from the heat until it “calms down” and put it back on the heat until the agarose is completely dissolved.
4. While heating, prepare the bed in which the gel will polymerize. Make sure that it is well balanced and tight, and that the “comb” is well placed.
5. When homogeneous, add 2 µL of SYBR SAFE DNA Gel Stain to the solution and mix well.
6. Pour the solution into the bed and clear all its bubbles with a tip.
7. Mix the samples with loading dye in a 10:1 ratio. Put the samples into the wells, as well as marker into the first well.
Note: For different size of gels , we have 25 ml ,50 ml and 100 ml agarose gel.

XIII.SDS/Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis(CLICK)
Pour the Separating Gel
Set up your gel apparatus, prepare separating gel monomer. Add TEMED just prior to pouring gel. Allow to polymerize before adding stacking gel by overlaying gently with water or n-butanol. With higher concentrations of gels, one can immediately pour the stacking gel on the unpolymerized separating gel. Be careful not to mix the two layers. Separating Gels, in 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8.
