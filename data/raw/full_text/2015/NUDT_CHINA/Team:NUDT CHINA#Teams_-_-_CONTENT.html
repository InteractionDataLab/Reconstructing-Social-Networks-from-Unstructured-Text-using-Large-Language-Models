In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing and some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2015, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TEAM><TEAM id="pos22" style="background-color: #386cb5;"><TABLE style="background-color: #386cb5;"><TBODY><TR><TD style="text-align: left;"><P style=" color: #ffffff"><STRONG>Nianhao Xie: </STRONG>I am Nianhao Xie, who is responsible for the modeling and wiki building. I have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners.

I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.

I come from Shandong province, which is thought to have many burly fellows. But not for me. I’m just a normal person who likes playing computer games and watching some animations. And I hate sports. Last year my teacher introduce iGEM to me. And then, after sometime of studying biology experiment, I have learnt how to do most of the experiments. This is difficult for me because I’m not a biology student. My undergraduate course is chemistry. However, in any case, I love biology. And I’ll do my best to do IGEM.

The curiosity to biology and the little knowledge I learned at high school encouraged me to join in this team. Fortunately, I learned everything needed for IGEM from our instructors and other members. I cover parts of the wet lab and give some ideas for our human practice. I cherish these months' life in this big warm family. To live, to experience. I believe everyone of our team have experienced and learned something to enrich our life.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TEAM><TEAM id="pos26" style="background-color: #f88e2d;"><TABLE style="background-color: #f88e2d;"><TBODY><TR><TD style="text-align: left;"><P style=" color: #000000"><STRONG>Dongyu Fan: </STRONG>Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!

The experience of working in iGEM team is really interesting. At the same time, I can learn more and more from other teammates who are not limited to the experimental skills of synthetic biology. Although there are new challenges every day, I enjoy the time to cooperate with them. No matter what we win in the end, I always believe that we will have an unforgettable experience.
