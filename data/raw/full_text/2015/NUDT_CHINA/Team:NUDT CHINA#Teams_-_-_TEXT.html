In 2015, NUDT_China is made up of 10 students and 5 instructors. Jie Li and Juanjuan Huang are undergraduates from Clinical Medicine in Central South University. Yuan Zhang is exchange student from Southern Medical University. The rest 7 students are from National University of Defense Technology who have different majors, from chemistry to aviation.
We got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. During the study of iGEM project, we inspired and encouraged each other. Now, iGEM is a family to us all.
We also appreciate all the others who provided valuable advice and essential materials for the project. If it were not for their help, the project would not have been so successful.
NOTE: Instructor Long Liu and Student Yizhou Wang are absent in the family photo for timetable clash.

You can know everyone contributions on our ATTRIBUTION page .
You can get every students' self introduction below. :)
Xinyuan Qiu:
Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing and some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2015, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.
Nianhao Xie:
I am Nianhao Xie, who is responsible for the modeling and wiki building. I have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners. (We are full of enthusiasm!)
Zhu Qianhui:
I’m Rose Zhu, a girl from Jiujiang city which is a lovely city near Poyang Lake. I have never been away from water. I enjoy dance and imagine I were a stream wiggling by the forests. Water is the best description of my personalities. I’m of a gentle and flexible nature. I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.
Jiaqi Sun:
My name is Jiaqi Sun. I come from Shandong province, which is thought to have many burly fellows. But not for me. I’m just a normal person who likes playing computer games and watching some animations. And I hate sports. Last year my teacher introduce iGEM to me. And then, after sometime of studying biology experiment, I have learnt how to do most of the experiments. This is difficult for me because I’m not a biology student. My undergraduate course is chemistry. However, in any case, I love biology. And I’ll do my best to do IGEM.
Yuan Zhang:
I'm Yuan Zhang, a medical student. The curiosity to biology and the little knowledge I learned at high school encouraged me to join in this team. Fortunately, I learned everything needed for IGEM from our instructors and other members. I cover parts of the wet lab and give some ideas for our human practice. I cherish these months' life in this big warm family. To live, to experience. I believe everyone of our team have experienced and learned something to enrich our life.
Dongyu Fan:
Hi, my name is Dongyu Fan. I'm from a historical city, Xi'an, which is a subtle blend of glorious history and modern civilization. Similarly, my character also has two sides, calm and delicate, also warm and lively. The same is true of my hobbies, I have great interest in both humanities and natural sciences, which makes my way of thinking both rational and emotional. This is my first time to participate in iGEM, and it's really a long and hard way from a non-professional person to a qualified experimenter. But to be honest, I firmly believe that the process is more important than the result. In this year, I deeply enjoy the time spending with the team members and also enjoy the fun of playing biology. that is my greatest achievement!
Juanjuan Huang:
My name is Juanjuan Huang. I'm a senior undergraduate majoring in Central South University. Because of the curiousness about iGEM, I joined the NUDT_CHINA. I take part in the construct of plasmid. The experience of working in iGEM team is really interesting. At the same time, I can learn more and more from other teammates who are not limited to the experimental skills of synthetic biology. Although there are new challenges every day, I enjoy the time to cooperate with them. No matter what we win in the end, I always believe that we will have an unforgettable experience.
Jie Li:
I am currently studying Clinical Medicine in Central South University. As a matter of fact, I joined the iGEM team of NUDT_CHINA by chance because of listening to a charming presentation of Xinyun Qiu, the originator last year. That’s quite an honor for me to participate in this family this year. With my knowledge of both medical biology and molecular biology, I hope to contribute to putting our experiment design into effect and go for a wonderful result.
Wang Yizhou:
Hello, I am Yizhou Wang, a member of the team NUDT_China, who used to be a participant of the National Competition of Biology in senior high school. Biology has always been my best subject. In our team, I work for Human practice, interviewing an expert mainly. I’m a quiet person with little words, but I have a passionate side which cannot be noticed easily. I enjoy the time in which I make several new friends, learn new knowledge through working with my partners.
Chushu Zhu:
My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. I am a junior at the National University of Defense Technology, major in chemistry. The undergraduate education gave me a wide range of vision and taught me how to cooperate with others. While learning biological knowledge and technique, I also get a sense of other field at the same time. That’s why I join the team of NUDT_CHINA. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers me a good chance to give full play to my creativity, intelligence and diligence.
