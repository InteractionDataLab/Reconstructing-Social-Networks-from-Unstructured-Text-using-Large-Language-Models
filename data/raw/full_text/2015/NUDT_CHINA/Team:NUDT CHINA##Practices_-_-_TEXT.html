INTERVIEW: Human Laboratory Animal Center
I.PREFACE
Considering our project may have an impact on the biopharmaceutical field to a certain extent, especially on the efficiency of the production of drug, we interviewed Hunan Laboratory Animal Center (HLAC) for some advice on safety and prospect.

IV.DIALOGUE
Dongyu Fan
Moring Dr. Jiang, thank you for accept our interview. We all know that, in recent years, bio-pharmaceutical security has been subject to the general interest. We've learned that the Experimental Animal Center are already passed the identification of United States AAALAC Certification Center on safety evaluation of drugs. So we hope we can gain an objective and comprehensive assessment of our project and are eager for valuable advice through this interview.
Lingyun Zhu
Moring Dr. Jiang! First of all, I would like to introduce our project. What we are actually doing is using synthetic biology to build a DNA support system. This system is in microorganisms so that we can increase efficiency of regionalization reaction through metabolic engineering of multi-enzymatic reaction.
As far as I understand, metabolic engineering is similar with biochemical reactions.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
Could you evaluate the safety of our reconstruction project of the microbial?
Our security assessment is mainly for drugs, such as the safety of medicines produced by the bioactive enzymes, which means we need a specific bioactive substance such as enzymes to conduct the safety assessment. Your project is more like a methodology study which does not have direct relation to medicine, so I can only make a safety assessment of potential safety hazard instead of a detailed one.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
What influence will be make to the cells if we change the signaling pathways of cell?
The level of the cell modification plays an important role in drug safety. Generally speaking, lower modification level means less side effects. Modification of subcellular structure may cause the cell activity change. If it leads to an acceleration of cell metabolism, it may eventually make the cell cancerous or autophagy.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
What kind of side effects?
Increasing reaction rate may result an accumulation of intermediate products which cause side effects. However, your project will not only increase the reaction efficiency but also make the reaction ordered. This modification of reaction chain makes reaction under control. In other word, the type and output of productions can be controlled. Theoretically, the side effects can be minimized.
Dr. Jiang
Dongyu Fan
Finally, could you please make a prospection of our project?
I have engaged in drug safety assessment many years. I think what restricts the development of the pharmaceutical industry is the disorder of reaction. The disorder makes it difficult to get the identical ingredients in different production batch which cause worse side effects. Your project is supposed to order the reaction chain and decrease the impure component of drug. This can not only increase the reaction rate but also improve the quality of drugs. I believe it will have a positive influence on the development of the pharmaceutical industry.
Dr. Jiang

Thanks for your answer.
