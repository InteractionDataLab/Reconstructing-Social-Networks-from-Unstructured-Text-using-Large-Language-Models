Characterization of Toehold and Toehold+Trigger for ATOMS_Turkiye
In the search of collaboration with the ATOMS_Turkiye, we have agreed with the Turkish squad for us to characterize two of their parts. We conducted a protein isolation and yielded results.
5 ml cultures containing the Toehold and toehold+trigger parts were incubated at 37 C for 16 hours. 1mM of iPTG was added at the end of the 16. hour. Another 4 hour  incubation was conducted. The proteins in the incubated cultures were then isolated. A flurometric measurement was conducted at 473 nm of emission and 510 nm of excitation values. The difference in between the measurements for the protein isolates of the two parts can be seen below:

Wiki Coding for the ATOMS_Turkiye Team
Our team coder and our mate Alihan Celikcan helped the ATOMS_Turkiye form their team wiki template. Together with Muhammed Fatih Aktas of the ATOMS Team, they prepared the initial draft of the wiki and the main functional features developed in the wiki.
SynBioDay
For a meeting of all the teams of Turkey, hopefully participating in this year’s jamboree, a Synthetic Biology Day was conducted. Our team, with also the teams ATOMS Turkiye, METU Ankara and METU HS gathered in the campus of Turgut Ozal University to present their projects, discuss ideas and establish roots for future collaborations. Many other people also participitated in the event to make an exiting day of SynBio for everyone!
