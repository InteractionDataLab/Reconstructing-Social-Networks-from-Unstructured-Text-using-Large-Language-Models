Abstract:
mobilized enzyme technology is an efficient process which the enzyme is attached to an inert, in           soluble material and  allows enzymes to be held in place throughout the reaction, following which they are easily separat           ed from the products and may be used again, so it is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed reactions. Compared with           the free enzyme, the immobilized enzyme can maintain its high specificity and catalytic properties of a particular enzyme.
Cellulosome are muti-enzyme complex  present in certain prokaryotes by a variety of cellulases, hemicellulases, relying on the specific interaction of cohesion-dockerin. Based on the cellulosome structure, we proposed a thought and method: cellulose as immobilization substrate, CBM(cellulose-binding module)as fixed labels, using three pairs of specific cohesion-dockerins amount of enzyme immobilization, reduce loss of enzyme activity and increase the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme. While achieving one-step enzyme purification and immobilization, reducing the cost of the immobilized enzyme.from different culture species to build a scaffold protein structure in order to improve the
The project is not only a new attempt of immobilized enzyme technology, but also for building multi-immobilized enzyme complex to explore new avenues.
