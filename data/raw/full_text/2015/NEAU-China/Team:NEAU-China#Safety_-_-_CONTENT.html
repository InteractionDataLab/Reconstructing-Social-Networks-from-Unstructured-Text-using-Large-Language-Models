Although our project is under low risk,all members of the team that have been actively involved in the laboratory work have received a general safety instruction to the laboratory, in which we have carried out the main part of our research for the iGEM project, by team advisor Li Jie prior to starting the work. We also identified when to use personal safety gear such as gloves, safety glasses etc.</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">according to Chinese laws and the work safety guidelines , as well as safe handling of biological materials according to the same standards .Since we only work with E-coli organisms and DNA, all our work is done on open benches or under open-front biosafety cabinet. For most procedures, basic protective gear (cotton lab coats &amp; latex gloves) is sufficient.  </DIV><DIV class="a02"><DIV class="a021">Lab Safety Checklist!</DIV><DIV class="a022">If you are going to work in the laboratory, check if you are ready to enter the lab and start the work with these simple recommendations:</DIV><DIV class="a023">Get a proper introduction to the lab(s) that you are going to work in.</DIV><DIV class="a023">Get acquainted with the safety rules and what to do in case of an emergency e.g. fire, spillage etc..</DIV><DIV class="a023">Plan your work in the laboratory:</DIV><DIV class="a023">Read the protocols and standard operating procedures  you are going to follow during your work</DIV><DIV class="a023">Identify when to use personal safety gear and what is the right gear such as gloves, safety glasses etc.</DIV><DIV class="a023">Book the right equipment e.g.. fume hoods, or centrifuges that you are going to use and get acquainted with it prior to usage.</DIV><DIV class="a023">Identify your limitations and when you need a second pair of hands to be able to perform the experiments.</DIV><DIV class="a023">Always plan to work in the laboratory when other people are present - NEVER work alone</DIV><DIV class="a023">Know your:</DIV><DIV class="a023">Chemicals, how to handle and dispose them - look up the instructions for each of the chemicals</DIV><DIV class="a023">Organisms and how to dispose them - are they generally regarded as safe or are they pathogenic and need extra caution</DIV><DIV class="a023">Know who to ask/call to get your questions answered and remember, there are no stupid questions.Have fun and be safe!</DIV></DIV><DIV class="neironga41">Safety form:</DIV><DIV class="neironga431">Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms,besides your chassis?</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">We meant to gain a large number of proteins,so we constructed the plasmid of dh5α E.coli and expressed in bl21 E.coli.
