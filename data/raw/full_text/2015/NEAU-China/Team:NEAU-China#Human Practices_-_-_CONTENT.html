Especially for a scientific project like the iGEM competition, it was valuable to unclose new perspecives and assess feasibility of our project ideas. Following, short protocols of the meetings and conversations are listed. At this point we would like to thank all individuals that have supported us with inspiring discussions, provision of constructs or material. </DIV></DIV><DIV class="neironga41" id="p21">Outreach</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">There is no doubt that IGEM needs a communication platform to share our idea, ask for and receive help. Though we have Meet up, IGEM Summit, Facebook and Twitter, indeed, these platforms fail to become popular. 
We visit to the pharmaceutical industrial companies, understanding pharmaceutical plant layout, and the drug production process (from raw materials to finished products). The leading managers strengthen our GMP knowledge and safety knowledge, which inspired us to hold a scientific exhibition. Cooperated with the Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bio-engineering Co. Ltd, we held a scientific exhibition about synthetic biology in Harbin’s Science Center. The theme of the exhibition is how synthetic biology improves our life, aiming to popularize the knowledge and application of synthetic biology in social life, history of IGEM foundation and introductions of our project. In the scientific experience section, visitors can obtain latest information about IGEM projects on posters and QR code. We thank Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bio-engineering Co. Ltd for great cooperation to achieve such a successful exhibition. </DIV><DIV class="neironga41" id="p22">Meetups</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Team construction</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">In Jan, 2015, the life science college firstly held an examination to select the IGEM pre-members of NEAU-Harbin-2015. In order to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and to attract new members for the 2015 IGME team, a symposium on synthetic biology and IGEM was organized, in which the IGEM pre-members gave lectures to introduce synthetic biology and previous IGEM projects. A series of  academic lectures were launched during the first few weeks. and then pre-members of NEAU-Harbin(2015) gave an introduction lecture about synthetic biology and IGEM. About 30 students participated in the lecture. In order for students to get a deeper understanding of synthetic biology and for team leader to select new members, more academic lectures were launched during this time. By a vivid description of our previous work, we attracted students from different majors to learn about a new synthetic biology world. 

</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Brainstorms </DIV><DIV class="neironga43">Once we set the NEAU-Harbin team, our team members did a hard work in determining the final project. Each of us pointed out at least one idea and made many discussions about different opinions. We think about the safety, value, feasibility and so on in the round. 
For Environment has always been a concern in the field of biological research. Especially for synthetic biology, we all choose to put our efforts in the environment governance. Although synthetic biology brings many benefits to our lives, as far as some people concerned, some pollutants that demonstrate serious environmental and ecological problems still can  not be removed. We devote ourselves in the project to solve this kind of problem. 
</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Peking university Summit</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">During the Peking university Summit, a lot of teams around China made presentation about their projects. Some common difficulties we met in our projects were discussed. After the Summit, we had a tour of Peking university lab, and we discussed about the difficulty of growing cultures. At last, we visited IGEM Headquarters and several IGEM experts gave excellent lectures to help us to solve those problems.
</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Give A Hand </DIV><DIV class="neironga43">During our meeting, a student of SCAU wanted to build their team next year in 2016 and asked us for help. We taught them how to build an IGEM lab and how to use the flow cytometry and freeze-dry machine. Since it’s their first time to attend iGEM, we shared our experience about running the IGEM project and helped them to get familiar with judging standard. Then we showed our poster and wiki last year. They declared that they will build their team to attend IGEM in 2016 probably.
</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Project presentation</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">During the Formosa, presentations were made to introduce every team’s design and progress. Questions were raised as well as good advise. Every one attended really touched the thrill of Emerge happiness, and got home fully load.</DIV><DIV class="neironga434">Poster Session</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">In poster session, we made an introduction about our project this year. To our surprise, we met some old friends last year. By sharing our lab life and experimental progress. we had a great fun with other IGEM teams. With lots of exchange of ideas, they were so nice to give us their suggestions about our project. 

</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">We treated the good opportunity to communicate with different universities having various backgrounds and school generations. So we tightly communicate with several IGEM teams to improve our idea and we appreciate their work.         </DIV><DIV class="neironga43">During the poster session here, Tsinghua-A team members majored in automation gave a warm welcome to us and gave us pieces of advice of our circuit modeling. With their help, we modified the basic idea of modeling and showed them how to do it with MATLAB. The discussion ended with good results and we had a lot of fun as well.            </DIV><DIV class="neironga43">When explained our content of poster to other students, we directly pointed out our disadvantage——the small blank corner of our poster, as a result of our slow experimental process. To our surprise, they had the same problems with us. It's true that experimental process is always full of difficulties.</DIV><DIV class="neironga41">Scientific camp</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">We gave a speech about IGEM to high school students,and we drew up posters with pictures and illustrations to let people understand easily. Also we had some conversation with them to know whether they could understand our explanation or not. It engaged the seniors to get first hand experience on what it is like to work in a synthetic biology lab, which made synthetic biology and our project approachable and transparent.</DIV><DIV class="neironga43"> In detail, first, we make more students become familiar with synthetic biology and IGEM Competition. And what makes us surprise is that they showed a great interest in the synthetic biology and some of the high school students plan to join us to participate in the college competition. In addition, some of them are trying to contact the headmaster to join the competition of high school level. Secondly, when we shared some good examples to them, they asked a whole lot of inspired questions. Some of the questions even could apply in our project.</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">Ultimately, we lead them into IGEM lab, and show them our experimental process. After the lecture and conducting experiments themselves, the students actively participated in a discussion and had a meaningful evening discussing of their opinions in research and synthetic biology. </DIV><DIV class="neironga41">Acknowledgment</DIV><DIV class="neironga43">We appreciate Mrs Cang Jing , Mr Gao Fang. And we are especially thankful to Mr Gao Fang for his being so nice to help us with the fund. We also appreciate Professor.

Then, under the loving care of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the State Council in February 14, 1986 approved the establishment of the National Natural Science Fund Committee. Natural Science Foundation of China adhere to support basic research, and gradually formed and developed a research project funded by the pattern, talent project and environmental conditions of the project consisting of three series.
