  Human Practice
With on going advances, the introduction to consequences of scientific research to the public is becoming an increasingly important task for an iGEM team, as it should be in every scientific community. The potential discoveries and applications in Synthetic Biology will have significant influences on everyday life, therefore a continuous and public dialogue on limitations and allowances is necessary. In our Human Practice work we address this problem in a comprehensive program and discuss benefits as well as dangers of Synthetic Biology.  Therefore，a key point of the human practice work for the iGEM-NEAU Team is to increase the dialogue between science, society and industry.
Peking university meetups
We started with presentations from different teams around China in Peking University. After that we discussed difficulties we met or are having with our projects. At the end of activity, we had a tour of Peking University lab, and we commented on the difficulty to grow cultures. Afterwards, we walked to iGEM Headquarters together. We listened in on experts' discussions about these problems and how iGEM can help them.
science camp
In poster session, we made a introduction about our project this year. To our surprise,we met some old friends last year, by sharing our lab life and experimental progress. We had a great fun with other iGEM teams. With lots of exchange of ideas, they were so nice to give us their suggestions about our project. We had a good opportunity to communicate with different universities having various backgrounds and school generations.
Visit to the pharmaceutica
We visit to the pharmaceutical industrial companies, understanding pharmaceutical plant layout, and the drug production process(from raw materials to finished products). The leading managers strengthen our GMP knowledge and safety knowledge, which inspiredus to hold a scientific exhibition .Cooperated with the Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Bioengineering Co. Ltd, we held a scientific exhibition about synthetic biology in Harbin Science Center.
collaborations
As a student team, we highly appreciated recommendations and feedback from experts of different scientific areas. Especially for a scientific project like the iGEM competition, it was valuable to unclose new perspecives and assess feasibility of our project ideas. Following, short protocols of the meetings and conversations are listed.
