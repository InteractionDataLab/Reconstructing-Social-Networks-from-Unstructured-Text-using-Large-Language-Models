Project running
4.20---5.19
project planning
Before we decided our project, we brainstormed many times and  put forward ideas with each other. With the help of advisors ,we determined to design our “Enzyme Brick”. To prepare the experiments, we spent days on searching literatures and shared with others. After discussing with advisors, we defined our project planning.
5.20---7.10
constructing carrier
At the beginning of the experiment, we designed the carriers we need.(Scaffolding I，Scaffolding II, Scaffolding III and enzyme). We transformed them for expression in E. coli.
7.11---7.15
Expressing and fermenting scaffolding protein，SDS-PAGE
After expression in E. coli., we fermented to achieve the goal of increasing protein amount. According to the result of SDS-PAGE, we make sure the success of expression of scaffolding and enzyme, we used SDS-PAGE to check out our experimental results.
7.16---7.25
Adsorbing the scaffolding protein  and measuring the efficiency of adsorption
In this period，our work was relatively simple，with three stages.
1、Connect Scaffolding II with Scaffolding I
2、Connect Scaffolding II with Scaffolding III
3、Integrate enzyme with the whole scaffolding
8.1----8.10
Measuring the purity of BCA protein
At the end of experiment, we used BAC protein quantitative kit to measure the amount of protein we adsorbed in order to ascertain the adsorption efficieny.
8.11---9.10

4.8----5.20
collecting literatures
After brainstorm, we made our project clear gradually. We combined cellusome with immobilized enzyme till our “Enzyme Brick” formed. We researched a large amount of literatures about our project and selected the useful ones.
5.21--6.30
sorting literatures
In order to make everyone understand our project and determine the final experiment planning, we had some meetings to summarize the information we got and discussed a lot so that we can make our project running successfully.
7.1---7.30
previous designing presentation and poster
During the period of our experiment, we prepared the presentation and poster at the same time including select pictures and information in literatures. In this way, our manuscripts completed. When we designed our presentation and poster, we consulted with our instructor, Dr Li Jing helped us a lot with the process of them. With our hard work, our mission finished comparatively successful.
8.1---8.15
making wiki
After sorting out ideas, we set about to making poster and PPT. Meanwhile we classified and altered manuscripts and pictures expecting to put them in our wiki.
8.16-9.18
presentation ，poster and wiki completed
All materials were accomplished, we finished poster and presentation at first. After that ,members who is in the team of copywriting team shared the ideas about frame and details in wiki. Absolutely, with our endeavor we fulfilled our prospective towards wiki as you see!

Medal criteria
Register:
We registered for iGEM in April and had a great and fulfilling summer vacation. We are ready to attend the Giant Jamboree!
Wiki:
We spent three months preparing our wiki. All materials were selected by us elaborately including text description and picture selection. We Created and shared a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and documented the team's parts using the Registry of Standard . Also, we created a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Now what you can see is our best wiki!
Judging Form：
You can find our judging form here !
Poster：
With carrying the experiment forward , we completed our poster step by step. We considered thoroughly and checked quite a lot of times . after a prolonged endeavor, we finished our poster perfectly.
Parts：
With hard work from May to September, we accomplished and  submitted the parts we designed to the iGEM Registry. All six parts (ctcbm cbm accoh acdoc bccoh bcdoc rtcoh rtdoc) achieved the standards of both bronze and silver medal.
Hunman practice:
1、In our summer vacation, we took part in National Youth Science Camp and advertise for IGEM.  2、We visited a pharmaceutical factory around our city to propagandize our project last term.  3、In august, we signed up for the meeting holed by Peking University. This time we not only have a practice for the comptation, but spent a good four-day's holiday as well. 4、We did some experiment in the Company Origin and learned many skills there. All of them gave us a large amount of help when we proceeded our project.
Conclusion：
We will pesent a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. And we matched the condition of both Bronze and silver medal. Thank you for the effort of all team members, thank you for IGEM that each of us have an opportunity to improve ourselves.
