Bioengineering, Final Year
I am a final year bioengineering student. After studying engineering for 3 years and working in a neuroengineering lab for 1.5 years, I decided to join iGEM to explore the field of genetics - one of the two fields in biology I love most (the other one is neural science and engineering). Even though I don’t have much prior experience or knowledge about genetics I was able to pick up the theory and skills quickly because I am a hand’s on learner. I believe my previous research experience, mathematical sense, logical thinking, engineering mindset, and proficiency in Excel and Matlab enabled me to contribute to the team. This was the first time I worked with so many science students  as a team. By doing so, I learn how powerful it is to cooperate with people from different disciplines. In addition to doing lab work, I was responsible for building the team Wiki, making computer simulations as well as characterising our lysis cassette constructs.
