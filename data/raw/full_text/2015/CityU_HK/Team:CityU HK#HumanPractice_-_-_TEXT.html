Purpose
Over the past few decades, synthetic biology has undoubtedly progressed rapidly to become an essential part of our life. Despite its increasing importance, many have not had the chance to understand it thoroughly, resulting in many misconceptions among the public. Due to unfamiliarity, fear and the lack of knowledge, he society are some major obstacles that deter the advancement of synthetic biology.
CityU iGEM team is part of the rapidly growing iGEM and synthetic biology community. Thus, it is our responsibility to increase the awareness of people to this emerging field and its applications
Our aim for this outreach is to engage and educate our local community. We aim to spread the positive message of synthetic biology to the general public. Through our outreach program, we would like to rectify the public’s misconceptions about the harmfulness of genetically modifies organisms (GMOs) while giving them a positive image of synthetic biology.
In order to accomplish what we have set forth to do, we have seriously considered different approaches through which we can build the bridge between synthetic biology and the society.
What have we accomplished?
Made synthetic biology approachable and apprehensible
Held exhibition and visits to high schools
Engaged the community in the game of synthetic biology
School Visits
 This summer, CityU iGEM team had the opportunity to visit different high schools. Students were engaged in an interactive yet informative module designed by the team in an attempt to increase public awareness about synthetic biology.

Survey
CityU iGEM team is aware of the controversial nature of our project and concerns people may have with the use of Genetically-Modified Organisms (GMOs). Owing to this, the team has put together a survey to gather the viewpoints from the general public with regards to issues on bioethics and bio-safety etc.
