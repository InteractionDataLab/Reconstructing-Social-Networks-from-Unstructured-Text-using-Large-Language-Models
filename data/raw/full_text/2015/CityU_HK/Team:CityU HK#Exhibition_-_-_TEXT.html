Exhibition - iGEM2015 wiki
To capture the interest of the general public on issues related to synthetic biology, the CityU iGEM team organized an exhibition to provide a platform for the community to learn and understand this new field of science. Posters with information on different areas of synthetic biology were specially designed and displayed at our exhibition.  Several of our team members served as tour guides to visitors and walked them through the concept of synthetic biology, its applications and iGEM lab activities. Some examples of the poster topics that were showcased are given below:
Poster
          As an initiative to promote the concept of synthetic biology, posters were specially designed to suit the acceptance and understanding of the general public. 
          Articles and brief write-ups were done so as to provide adequate information for the people to digest. We do not want to make it too comprehensive and tough, which may deter the general public from learning about synthetic biology.
          Here are some examples of the posters we had done to arouse the public's interest in learning about this new field of science.
