*Abstract*
Lactose intolerance is a gastrointestinal problem signified by symptoms such as bloating, stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea after consuming milk or dairy products. Normally, lactase in the small intestine will break down lactose into glucose and galactose for absorption. For people with lactose intolerance, their bodies produce little or no lactase. Undigested lactose will therefore enter the colon where bacteria may ferment the lactose to produce lactic acid and gases as by-products. These by-products are the culprits of the symptoms.  There is evidence suggesting that dairy consumption is associated with lower risk of hypertension and higher rate of bone mineralization. To help people with lactose intolerance to enjoy the diverse health benefits from dairy consumption,  our iGEM Team (CityU_HK) has set a goal to tackle this problem.
