Results - iGEM2015 wiki
This summer, the CityU iGEM team visited several high schools around Hong Kong to engage students in an interactive and informative module with the aim of stimulating their interest in science and promoting awareness and understanding of synthetic biology. The high school students enjoyed the talk and activities organized by our team and expressed their interest in the field of synthetic biology which is presently not covered in the high school curriculum. 
Aims
Educate high school students about synthetic biology
Stimulate interest in synthetic biology through interactive and educational activities
Generate discussion about social and ethical concerns surrounding synthetic biology
From the outreach program, we realized that high school students are more knowledgeable than we previously thought. They have a basic understanding of synthetic biology and its applications although there is little discussion about synthetic biology by teachers and classmates in schools. Through our interactions with high school students, it is clear that the barrier that lies between synthetic biology and the younger generation is the lack of adequate means for proper discussion.
