In the media
One of our priorities during the project has been to inspire and amaze the general public. We appeared in more than 20 printed newspapers in Denmark, countless web-newspapers and where invited for radio interviews on the radio station NOVA (the third most listened to radio station in Denmark), the P1 Science Magazine and even the Austrian Radio Vienna. The week of our press release our story was THE most printed article from Ritzau news agency (the biggest news bureau in Denmark) and after the Jamboree in Boston we were contacted by New Scientist Magazine!. This media attention was very educative and an excellent platform to engage in ethical discussion. We addressed and discussed this issue in a follow-up article in one of the biggest newspapers in Denmark 'Politiken' and in the radio interview on NOVA. On this page you can see some headlines from selected papers as well as a full list of our media appearances.
Disclaimer:
Due to Danish press-laws, we are unable to deep-link to the articles themselves. Instead, every screenshot below links to the paper's main site (or the relevant section's site), from which a quick search for 'spacemoss' yields the relevant article
New Scientist
New Scientist is a UK-based weekly English-language international science magazine, founded in 1956. The magazine covers current developments, news, reviews and commentary on science and technology. The SpaceMoss article was printed online under the headline 'Moss on Mars?
