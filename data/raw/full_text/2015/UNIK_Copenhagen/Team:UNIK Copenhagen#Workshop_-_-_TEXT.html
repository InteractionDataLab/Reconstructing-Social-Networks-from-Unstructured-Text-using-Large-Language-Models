Human Exploration and Space Flight
Kiruna, Sweden - August 15th 2015
SpaceMoss attended the course Human Exploration and Space Flight in Kiruna (Northern Sweden). The course is about the historical development of human spaceflight, an understanding of the requirements to be met in order to send humans into space now and in the future. During the course we discussed our idea with respected scientists and even an astronaut, launched rocket SpaceMoss and held a presentation for the course participants.
