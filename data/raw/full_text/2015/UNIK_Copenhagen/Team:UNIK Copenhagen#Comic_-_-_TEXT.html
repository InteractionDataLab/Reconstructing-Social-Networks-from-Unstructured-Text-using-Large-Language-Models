Comic
The comic below is the result of a collaboration between the artist Johanne Holm and members of the SpaceMoss team. The comic attempts to describe the vision and methods of our project in Johanne's unique visual style.
SpaceMoss and the Space Man
SpaceMoss was present at the lecture given by recently returned Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen at the UCPH ball room, and our comics were a hit with the attending crowds. Everybody wanted one and we were trying desperately to keep up with demand.
"One very cool moment, early on, was to hear the minister of science exclaim ’SpaceMoss! I’ve heard of you guys!’ upon receiving his copy!"
The lecture was amazing, and we were all stoked to hear the first-hand account of Andreas’ trip to the ISS, a mere five days after he’d returned. There were lots of good questions from the audience, including questions from each attending member of SpaceMoss. Upon asking how long he thought it’d be before we saw a human on Mars, Andreas replied that it’s hard to tell, but if everybody got behind it, we could get there in maybe 15 years. ‘Technologically’, he said (and we’re paraphrasing from memory), ‘we’re closer to Mars now, than the Apollo was to the moon, when they first set out’.
After the lecture, there were refreshments and mingling, and one SpaceMoss’er stuck around long enough to be treated to a relaxed conversation with the man himself about which steps to take in order to be considered for astronaut training, given his current background. At that same conversation, Andreas took great interest in our project, wanting to know technical details and how far we’ve progressed.
All in all a very cool experience for all of us, and Andreas left with a smile - and a SpaceMoss comic tucked safe in his pocket.
