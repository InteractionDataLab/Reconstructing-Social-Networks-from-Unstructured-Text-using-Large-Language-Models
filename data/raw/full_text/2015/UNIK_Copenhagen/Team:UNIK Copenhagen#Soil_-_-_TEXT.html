Can Moss Grow on Martian Soil?
Testing if moss can survive in soil similar to Martian soil is an interesting experiment for two reasons:
It would save launch mass if the moss could grow in the soil already present on Mars, although it would be possible to bring a media for the moss to grow in.
Mars soil contains perchlorate which is poisonous and moss could potentially be used to detoxify the martian soil and make it safe for astronauts.

What is JSC Mars-1 Simulant Soil?
JSC Mars-1 is a Martian soil stimulant that has been developed for the study of Mars both in the context of education and scientific research. The simulant is made from soil found on Pu'u Nene, a cinder cone on the Island of Hawai'i. It was chosen for a number of reasons:
It's spectral analogue to the bright regions on Mars
It has been characterized vigorously by other scientists
A large quantity is available for collection
JSC Mars-1 has been characterized using a number of techniques, both chemical and physical, and then compared to our knowledge of martian soil collected by various rovers on the surface of Mars.

JSC-Mars-1-simulant soil comes from the sadle area between the volcanoes Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on Big Island Hawaii. Team member Christina Toldbo went there to visit - check out the video below.

Experimental Setup
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to test whether moss can survive when spread over martian soil simulant: JSC Mars-1
Materials
Wild type moss
Petri dishes
Phys B (moss growth medium)
Moss Blender
Martian soil simulant; JSC Mars-1 (MS)
Brightfield microscope
Using the microscope to take images of moss grown in JSC Mars-1 simulant
Method
Blend wild type moss in a moss blender
Spread wild type moss on petri dish on the following to seperate mediums: Phys B+ MS and Water + MS
Create control by spreading wild type moss on petri dish with just Phys B medium
Place petri dishes for growth under optimum growth conditions
Let moss grow for 3-4 weeks
Take images of the moss with a microscope and the following filters:

Conclusion
From this simple experiment, we can conclude that moss can survive when spread on JSC Mars-1 simulant. Due to the similarities of JSC Mars-1 simulant to martian soil we can conclude that there is a potential that martian soil will not kill the moss, however it should be noted that JSC Mars-1 simulant contains more water and nutrients than martian soil. It should also be taken into account that the moss was grown in optimum growth conditions that are not present on Mars, where the moss is also exposed to high UV radiation and perchlorites in the soil. However we were encouraged to atleast see some survival in the simulant.
