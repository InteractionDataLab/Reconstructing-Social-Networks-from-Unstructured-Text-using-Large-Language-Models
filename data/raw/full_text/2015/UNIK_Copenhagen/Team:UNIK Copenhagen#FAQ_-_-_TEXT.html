What is the iGEM competetion?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is a world wide annual event in synthetic biology. Students start, fund and conduct their own research project. In September, the teams will meet at the Giant iGEM Jamboree at MIT, Boston, and present their work. Apart from the experimental work, the teams have to consider ethical issues of their project and do outreach activities.

How do I become part of an iGEM team

What is Project SpaceMoss?
Project SpaceMoss conducts research on the possibility of sending genetically modified moss to Mars.
How Did Team SpaceMoss Start?
Team SpaceMoss started with posters that popped up at Copenhagen University saying only one thing: "SpaceMoss" and a meeting place. We were all intrigued and showed up to the information meeting where we realized that this could be the potential to be involved in a fascinating project that could change the way people view Synthetic Biology and Astrophysics. The original idea for SpaceMoss was made by members from the Copenhagen 2013 iGEM team. Their wiki can be found here: 2013 Team's wiki . We were then told to send in our CVs, a letter of motivation and to fill out a personality test. These were reviewed and a team of 8 people was put together based on our capabilities and talents. We were then divided into three sub groups of those responsible for lab, project management and outreach.
Why Moss?
Moss is a very sturdy plant that can already handle rough conditions. Therefore, it has a higher change of surviving harsh conditions on Mars. Research in transformation of moss has been on-going for years at Center for Synthetic Biology whereas other teams and institutes often use E.coli or Yeast - one benefit of using moss it that it consumes carbondioxide and creates oxygen.
