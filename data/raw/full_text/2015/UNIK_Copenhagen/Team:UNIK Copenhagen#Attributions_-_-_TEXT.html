As a team we have learned a lot during the process. Due to our cross-disciplinarity our skills complement each other very well and we have been able to work on all aspects of the project ourselves. We have made good use of our brilliant supervisors and we have not been afraid to ask far and wide for advice and input. Therefore this page is dedicated to everyone who have helped and supported us. If you flip the picture of each person you can read how they helped us individually.
Supervisors
Cecilie is studying a master in Biology-Biotechnology. She has been an amazing help with the lab work and wiki design.
Cecilie Cetti Hansen
Josephine Schrøder is MSc in Biotechnology. Her advice has been invaluable with the experimental design and she made sure we had lab and office space. She also taught how to "handle" moss and propagation moss cultures.

Anna is an iGEM project organizer. She studies a PhD at University of Copenhagen Plant Science Center. She has helped us with the experimental design and given us protocols for PCR and purification of DNA.
Anna Holzwarth
Nanna is project coordinator at Center for Synthetic Biology, University of Copenhagen. She has been guiding us from the very start and provided extraordinary help with the outreach and funding parts of our project.
Nanna Heinz
Will has a MSc in Business Administration, & Bio-Entrepreneurship and was one of the key people involved in starting this years iGEM  team. With his experience from participating in the 2013  iGEM competition and though his role as CEO of TychoBio his advice and guidance throughout the project have been invaluable.
