TEAM
Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM began in 2007 with a handful of members, but has grown rapidly in recent years. Now a part of the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center , S&T iGEM meets and organizes outreach year-round. When they leave our dark cave of a lab in the basement of Schrenk Hall, our students study a wide variety of majors, from chemical engineering to physics.
