Electrical Transformation of 2015 iGEM Plate 1 3O
Start Time: 3:00pm
Purpose: To transform and clone a promoter and rbs in standard iGEM backbone for later addition of last year's hmp part.
Protocol: 1.5µL of BBa_K608002, previously taken from iGEM Plate 1 3O, was electrically transformed into competent cell. An 1.8kV pulse was applied according to Lab Manual procedure. Plates were left to incubate overnight.

InocµLations of hmp frozen stock and colonies from ET1 5/22 200µL plate
Start Time: 3:00pm
Purpose: To have liquid culture grown up of hmp and the iGEM kit parts (Promoter + rbs)
Protocol: Inoculation of 2 broth cultures from each the hmp frozen stock and the ET1 5/22 200µL plate. Wire loop was used for 3 of the 4 total samples, pipette for the last hmp broth culture. Procedure taken from iGEM LTP Lab Manual edition 2

Miniprep and digestion of hmp, pro/rbs, and amp BB
Start Time: 3:09pm
Purpose: To extract and digest BBa_K608002, hmp, and linearized pSB1A3
Protocol: Solution miniprep procedure attached to front of lab training manual was used on 3mL of liquid culture. Minipreps 1-4 were analyzed by nanodrop and showed no DNA due to a mistake in miniprep procedure. Identical minipreps were performed using the remaining 2mL of culture. Nanodrop then showed DNA presence, so the following digests were prepared: D1- 20.5 µL pSB1A3, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL PstI; D2 - 14.5 µL water, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 6 µL MP5, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL SpeI; D3 - 18.5 µL water, 2.5 µL 10x Tango, 2 µL MP7, 1 µL XbaI, 1 µL PstI
