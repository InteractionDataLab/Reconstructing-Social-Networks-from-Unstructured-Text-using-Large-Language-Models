Our <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/0/09/Mstigem_ltm_e2.pdf">Lab Training Manual</A>, which contains a variety of safety and procedure information, and our online lessons are currently being revised to better prepare future lab workers. The Lab Training Program culminates in the &quot;mini-project,&quot; where trainees are given a small task and must produce a final product using parts from the iGEM DNA Distribution. Our goal is to train safe and productive lab workers by giving them a chance to try each procedure themselves under the supervision of an experienced member.</P><P onmousemove="mouse(event)">We used <I>E. coli DH5Î±</I>, a non-pathogenic strain, for all assembly and as the chassis for testing. We attempted to express the mevalonate pathway to produce (E)-beta-ocimene, a safe terpene with pleasant scent. Our final safety form may be found <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Safety/Final_Safety_Form?team_id=1737">here</A>.</P><P onmousemove="mouse(event)">While assembling our parts, we used a lac promoter to control expression. A different approach would have to be taken for use outside of the lab, however. Ocimene indiscriminately inhibits microbial growth, so continuous production in a cave environment would have the potential to significantly impact the microbiome of bats' skin and the cave itself. We are investigating ways of sensing the causative agent of White-Nose Syndrome, <I>P. destructans</I>, as a potential future project. For real-world applications, sensing of the fungus would need to be coupled with either a kill switch or regulation of ocimene production. Before use for bat conservation, it should also be confirmed that ocimene has no adverse effects on bat species.</P></DIV></DIV><P id="credit" onmousemove="mouse(event)">Missouri cave photo by Lynn Dieter</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
