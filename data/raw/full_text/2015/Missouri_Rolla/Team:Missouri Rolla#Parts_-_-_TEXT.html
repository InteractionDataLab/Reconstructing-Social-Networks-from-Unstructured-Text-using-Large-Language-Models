PARTS
Part BBa_K1737000 is an improvement of last year's BBa_K1370000 , nitric oxide dioxygenase from the hmp gene of E. coli. We added the promoter and ribosome binding site BBa_K608002 to the coding region. We also prepared our part for GST-tagging and purification, but were unable to finish before Jamboree.
The remainder of our parts for this year's project were designed for Gibson assembly and ordered in short fragments as IDT gBlocks. Unfortunately, our Gibson assemblies failed, most likely due to secondary structure in overlap regions. We are now ordering the same genes for Standard Assembly, but will have to finish and submit the planned parts after Jamboree. Parts 1 and 2 together form the mevalonate pathway after assembly, and produce (E)-beta-ocimene from Acetyl-CoA. Part 3 is isolated ocimene synthase for use in studying enzymatic characteristics.
Part 1 includes the mvaE and mvaS genes from Enterococcus faecalis. The enzyme coded by mvaE performs two distinct steps in the mevalonate pathway.

Part 3 is ocimene synthase (TPS02) from A. thaliana, which produces the final product, (E)-beta-ocimene.
