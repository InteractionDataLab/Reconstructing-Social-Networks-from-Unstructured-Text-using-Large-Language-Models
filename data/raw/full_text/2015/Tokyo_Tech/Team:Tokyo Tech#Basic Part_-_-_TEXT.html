BBa_K1632010
fimB(wild-type)
FimB ( BBa_K1632010 ) is a Fim recombinase.  This is derived from the wild type MG1655.  FimB invert the fim switch in the [ON] to [OFF] direction and in the [OFF] to [ON] direction (Fig.5-2-0-1.).
From our experimental results, we confirmed that the FimB protein inverts the fim switch(wild-type) in the [ON] to [OFF] direction and in the [OFF] to [ON] direction with approximately equal probability and works ideally (Fig.5-2-0-2.).  The expression of FimB is controlled by arabinose in PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ).

1. fim switch (wild-type): BBa_K1632004, BBa_K1632005
BBa_K1632004
fim switch[default ON](wild-type)
BBa_K1632005
fim switch[default OFF](wild-type)
We are the first team in iGEM to successfully construct both the fim switch[default ON](wild-type) and the fim switch [default OFF](wild-type) and experimented them.  These fim switch is derived from a wild type. The fim switch(wild-type) has a sigma 70 promoter which functions constitutively.  We submitted two parts, one in the [default ON] ( BBa_K1632004 ) and the other in the [default OFF] ( BBa_K1632005 )(Fig.5-2-1-1). The fim switch (wild-type) is inverted by two recombinases, FimB ( BBa_K1632010 ) and FimE ( BBa_K1632011 ).  Therefore, we can regulate the expression of the gene downstream of the fim switch (wild-type) by adding the Fim recombinase.  From our results of experiment, they work ideally (Fig.5-2-1-2 and Fig.5-2-1-3).
Fig.5-2-1-1. fim switch is inverted by two recombinases, FimB and FimE. These proteins have distinct activities. The FimB protein inverts fim switch in the ON-to-OFF and the OFF-to-ON direction with approximately equal probability

2. fimE (wild-type): BBa_K1632011
BBa_K1632011
fimE(wild-type)
FimE ( BBa_K1632011 ) is a Fim recombinase.  This is derived from the wild type MG1655.  FimE invert the fim switch in the [ON] to [OFF] direction.
From our experimental results, we confirmed that the FimE protein inverts the fim switch(wild -type) predominantly in [ON] state to [OFF] state direction.  The expression of FimE is controlled by arabinose in PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ).  From our experimental results (Fig. 5-2-2-1), they work ideally.

fim switch[default ON](Tokyo_Tech/R0010)
We designed another fim switch with a standardized interchangeable promoter, fim switch (Tokyo_Tech).  A difference between the fim switch (wild-type) and the fim switch (Tokyo_Tech) is that we replaced the sigma 70 promoter to the J23119 promoter" ( BBa_J23119 ) and two restriction enzyme cut sites are added in each side of the promoter.(Fig.5-2-3-1).   Due to this addition of the restriction enzyme cut sites, we were able to replace the J23119 promoter ( BBa_J23119 ) in the fim swtich (Tokyo_Tech).  There is an example. fim switch [default ON] (Tokyo_Tech/R0010) ( BBa_K1632006 ) is made by removing the J23119 promoter ( BBa_J23119 ) and inserted Plac promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) (Fig.5-2-3-2) .
