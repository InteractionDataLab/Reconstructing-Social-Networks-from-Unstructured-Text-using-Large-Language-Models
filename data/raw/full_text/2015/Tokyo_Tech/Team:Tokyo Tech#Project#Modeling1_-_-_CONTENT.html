After modeling 2 different solutions to overcome the leakage, we found the most efficient solution of tagging the CmR protein with ssrA, which successfully led to expected results in our wet lab and ultimately led to our precise replication of the payoff matrix. </P><P class="text">We could not obtain positive results in our modeling by increasing the concentration of Cm, which was the other solution, so we confirmed that tagging the CmR gene with ssrA is a better solution.

Given the result from the wet lab that the OD of , we assumed that the promoter is activated and CmR is produced even in the absence of AHL.

Although up to this point, the concentration of Cm was set to 100 µg/mL, we calculated the OD, setting the concentration of Cm to 150 µg/mL.
The results are shown in Fig.4-1-2-1, and in Fig.4-1-2-2. We used the equations (1’),(2’),(3’),(4’),(5),(6),(7’),(8’),(9),(10),and (11).

As the other solution, we tagged CmR with ssrA, which is a degradation tag.In order to reflect the effect of the ssrA tag, we customized the equations (1’), (2’) to the following (1”), (2”).
