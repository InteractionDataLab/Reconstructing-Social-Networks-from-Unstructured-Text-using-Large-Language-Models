Since we received opinions from the public who concerned the sustainability, safety, and security of gene modification, we designed and executed the prisoner’s dilemma game played by the public. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD width="490x"><P class="text3">As shown in Fig. 6-1-0-1, in total, we have four types of payoff matrix. In Group 1 and Group 3 there is a dilemma. In Group 2 and Group 4 there is no dilemma. In the payoff matrices associated with the idea of GMO (Group 3 and Group 4), we wrote the sum of the costs and benefits of using GMO, as the profit in each combination of options. If the game in which there is no dilemma (or in other words the Nash equilibrium matches with the Pareto efficiency) (Group 2), is played to simply compete the scores, the combination of options on the bottom right would be rational. We designed this game, so that when we combine this same payoff matrix with the story associated with GMO (Group 4), using GMO will lead to high scores.

Even though this combination of options (row 1, column 1) is not Pareto efficient, disfavor of GMO may have attracted more selections to this combination of options with less profit. (Further description is written here)).  A possible interpretation from this result is that the public’s option selection was affected by concerns for sustainability, safety, and security of genetic modification, which were not shown in the payoff matrix.  To precisely examine further on this interpretation, we would like to increase the number of subjects playing the prisoner’s dilemma game.

Reflecting on our own conception of risks and benefits led to addressing       social justice.</H3><P class="text3">We realized the importance of reflecting on our own conception of risks and benefits, from one of the cases of the prisoner’s dilemma game held among the public. We think that such an original finding is an innovative education to ourselves and meets the criteria of the gold medal. </P><P class="text3">In the game played among high school students and undergraduate students, who are all people outside of iGEM, we identified an example where the player himself realized the irrationality of selecting the options adhered to the stereotypes of the term GMO, in the middle of the iterated game. Player B in Fig.6-1-0-3, experienced option selection influenced by preconceptions obtained when we first explained the original Prisoner’s Dilemma scenario. From the 4th round of the game, realizing that higher points is needed to win the game, Player B’s option became ‘use.’ So we temporarily thought of asserting that “each individual’s constant thinking of whether the payoff matrix is correct or not, will lead to the increase of the score for the entire society”. However, from our full year experience in iGEM, we realized the necessity of verifying from a different point of view. In other words, we realized that we researchers ourselves must also continuously reflect on the costs, benefits, and risks of the science we discover. In the workshop that we attended as our initial activity in iGEM, we learned from social scientists, the danger of grounding on the deficit model, which fixes on the idea that the general public is ignorant, and the importance of the two-way dialogue between society and researchers. From this past experience, we realized that it wasn’t the participants of the prisoner’s dilemma game who were misinterpreting the payoff matrix from the stereotype of the term GMO, but it might have been the members of iGEM Tokyo Tech who were misinterpreting both the costs and benefits of GMO. The profit of our payoff matrix in the dilemma game was indeed designed from assumptions for both the costs and benefits of GMO. Now we address that in order to understand the correct payoff matrix of technology, instead of forcing a concept that is constructed only by researchers, one-sidedly to the general public, the attitude of cooperating and thinking together with the general public, is important in social justice. Through these process written above, we think that we have already met the silver and gold medal criteria, since we have demonstrated an innovative human practice involving public engagement, by establishing a two-way dialogue.

We have thought that the establishment of a two-way dialogue is important for synthetic biology to be understood from general public, and is important to avoid any prejudice against synthetic biology. In a school festival, thus we explained our projects to attract the public’s interest, and successfully received valuable comments for improving our project. The most important comment led to the introduction of random decision making by <I>E. coli</I> itself, since we had originally planned to express choices of options made by humans, in each prisoner coli. Since then, we adopted FimB recombinase for such <I>E. coli</I> decision making. Another integration for the project’s execution to attract public interest, was the introduction of option selecting strategies by the prisoners. We were excited by identifying a famous strategy in the series of games played beyond the bench by the public, and were sure that the introduction of such strategies would make the game more attractive. We thus implemented the tit-for-tat strategy by adopting FimE recombinase into the design of our Decision making <I>coli</I>. </P><P class="text3">Now we are confident that our <I>E. coli</I> version of the prisoner's dilemma game is important to strengthen a two-way dialogue to a wide range of public.

Introduction</H2><P class="text">In our process of having high school students and undergraduate students participate in our prisoner’s dilemma game, we realized the importance of reflecting on our own conception of risks and benefits.When we explained about iGEM and about our project in the school festival, we received from the public skeptical opinions surrounding genetic modification. Therefore, we decided to investigate and identify the stereotypes surrounding genetic modification.</P><H2 id="2" class="smalltitle">2. Dilemma Game</H2><P class="text">To investigate what kind of stereotypes people in the general public have about genetic modification, we prepared four types of games, Group 1 ~ Group4.</P><P class="text">Group 1 is a simple prisoner’s dilemma game where there is a dilemma.</P><P class="text">Group 2 also is a simple prisoner’s dilemma game, but there is no dilemma.</P><P class="text">Group 3 has the same payoff matrix as Group 1, so there is a dilemma.</P><P class="text">Group 4 has the same payoff matrix as Group 2, so there is no dilemma.
For Group 3 and 4, the payoff matrices are associated with the idea of GMO. The combination of options in the payoff matrices consists of the sum of the costs and benefits resulting from using GMO.</P><P class="text"> We had the participants form a pair of two.

In Group 1’s payoff matrix (Fig.6-1-2-1), considering the profit of each combination of options, there should be a dilemma between selecting cooperation and selecting defection.
In Group 2’s payoff matrix (Fig.6-1-2-2), considering the profit of each combination of options, there should not be a dilemma between selecting cooperation and selecting defection, because rationally thinking, selecting defection would lead to higher scores.</P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="”50%”" align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.6-1-2-1.

From this result, we could interpret that the public has concerns for sustainability, safety, and security of genetic modification, which were not shown in the payoff matrix. </P><H2 id="5" class="smalltitle">5.

From the 4th round of the game, realizing that higher points is needed to win the game, Player B’s option became ‘use’. From this result, we interpreted that until the 3rd round, Player B, who was influenced by preconceptions of the original Prisoner’s Dilemma scenario, was imagining a payoff matrix like the one in Group 1 (Fig.6-1-3-1) and in Group 3 (Fig.6-1-3-3), where there is a dilemma, and was misled into a dilemma. However, when Player B selected the option ‘use’ in the 4th round, since his score increased more than he expected, he realized that the points were different between the payoff matrix he was imagining in his head, and the payoff matrix in the game he was playing. Since Player B realized that he was misinterpreting the payoff matrix in the first half of the game, the total scores between Player A and Player B did not differ so greatly. </P><H3 id="51" class="smalltitle">5.1. Modeling<P class="text">Given Result 2, we simulated how the timing of realizing the fact that “the payoff matrix that one was imagining in his/her mind is wrong,” affects the total score. In this model, we used Group 4’s payoff matrix and made both A and B use the random strategy. However, in A’s mind instead of Group 4’s payoff matrix, he/she is imagining Group 3’s payoff matrix. Since the payoff matrix in his/her mind does not match with the payoff matrix in reality, the increase in score that one is imagining in his mind will also not match with the score in reality. When his/her score goes below a certain number than the opponent’s score, he/she will realize that he/she is misinterpreting the payoff matrix.
We called this certain amount the score gap and simulated 2 types of score gap. In one type we set the score gap to -10, so that one realizes the misinterpretation of the payoff matrix quickly, and in the other type we set the score gap to -50, so that it takes time for one to realize the misinterpretation of the payoff matrix. After simulating the 2 types of score gap 20 times each, since the decisions are made randomly by both players, we obtained various results. The following are a few examples from the results.

Conclusion 2</H2><P class="text">From the results of the modeling, we found out that faster realization of the misunderstanding of the payoff matrix, leads to higher total scores. Therefore, we temporarily thought of asserting that “each individual’s constant thinking of whether the payoff matrix is correct or not, will lead to the increase of the score for the entire society.”</P><P class="text">However, from our full year experience in iGEM, we realized the necessity of verifying from a different perspective.

We researchers must continuously keep reflecting on the payoff matrix, and pursue the one closest to reality.
