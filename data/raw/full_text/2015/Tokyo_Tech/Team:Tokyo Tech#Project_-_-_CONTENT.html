Introduction</H2><P class="text">In our <I>E. coli</I>’s version of Prisoner’s Dilemma game involving two prisoner <I>coli</I>, the results of their options define the profit they obtained.  Here, profit means the growth of <I>E. coli</I>.  Like the prisoners in the game theory, we genetically engineered two <I>E. coli</I> to act as the prisoners, Prisoner A and Prisoner B.  The prisoner <I>coli</I>s are able to cooperate or to defect in our game.  The combinations of their options (cooperation or defection) affect the profit they obtained which equals to their growth.  To cooperate, they produce AHL while to defect, they do not produce AHL.  Each prisoner <I>coli</I> is designed to produce different type of AHL (C4HSL or 3OC12HSL).  The act of producing AHL imposes a metabolic burden on both prisoner <I>coli</I>.</P><H2 id="2" class="smalltitle">2. The original Prisoner’s Dilemma scenario in game theory</H2><P class="text">The original Prisoner’s Dilemma scenario involves two members of a criminal gang who were given an option-selection opportunity either to cooperate or to defect, in order to pursue for the best profit defined in the payoff matrix (Fig.2-1-2-1).  This Prisoner’s Dilemma game is a typical example analyzed in game theory.  The two gangs were arrested by the police.  They were separated into two different rooms so that they can’t communicate.  In these individual rooms, each prisoner was given an the opportunity either (1) to cooperate with the other prisoner by remaining silent, or (2) to defect the other criminal by confessing to his crime.  Their corresponding punishment is shown in Fig.2-1-2-1.  This table is called the payoff matrix.  </P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-2-1. </STRONG>The payoff matrix in Prisoner’s Dilemma (punishment = imprisoned years)</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text">From the payoff matrix, one rational option combination, called the Nash equilibrium, is when both chooses defection.  From A’s point of view, if B were to defect, A should choose to defect, comparing 10 years to 5 years of imprisonment.  If B were to cooperate, A should choose to defect, comparing 2 years to 0 year of imprisonment.  In other words, regardless of which option the other decides, each prisoner is punished less by defecting the other.  B’s rational decision is the same as A, so combination of both prisoner’s defection is one rational option combination.  </P><P class="text">Although both prisoners’ defection result from the combination of selfish option selecting, the combination of both prisoners’ simultaneous cooperation actually brings more profit to both prisoners than the combination of such selfish selections.  Apparently, 5 years imprisonment for both prisoners is more severe than 2 years imprisonment for both prisoners.  Thus the combination of both prisoners’ defection is not called Pareto efficiency.  This game with such payoff matrix where Nash equilibrium is not the Pareto efficient is called the Prisoner’s Dilemma.</P><H2 id="3" class="smalltitle">3.

Firstly, we adjusted the model to include leaky expression of CmR protein (Fig.2-1-3-7C) (Further information of modeling is <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Project/Modeling">here</A>).  We then planned two solutions, each of which is evaluated by modeling, to circumvent the effect of leaky expressions (Fig.2-1-3-7DE).

The improved parts (BBa_K1632020) was used for construction of BBa_K1632023 circuit for C4HSL inducible expression of <I>CmR</I>. Compared with circuits without an ssrA tag BBa_K1632025, our improved BBa_K1632023 indeed showed much slower growth which corresponds to “middle” growth inhibition (Fig.2-1-3-9 pink dotted line).  Furthermore, addition of C4HSL recovers active cell growth which corresponds to “none” growth inhibition (Fig.2-1-3-9 blue line).

Containing [ON] and [OFF] states, the <I>fim</I> switch controls the direction of transcriptions.  The promoter in the <I>fim</I> switch directs transcription to the right when the <I>fim</I> switch is in the [ON] state.  In the [OFF] state of the <I>fim</I> switch, on the other hand, the promoter directs transcription to the left.  We further designed to allocate AHL-producing enzyme coding sequence at the left side of the <I>fim</I> switch.  Note that, [ON] state <I>fim</I> switch will make prisoner <I>coli</I> to produce AHL, indicating cooperation.  On the contrary, [OFF] state <I>fim</I> switch will prevent prisoner <I>coli</I> from AHL production, indicating defection.

This is the first case in iGEM to show random inversion of a promoter.  From the histogram C and D in Fig.2-1-4-4, forward move of the peak indicates increased accumulation of GFP by the FimB expression.  This shows that some amount of <I>fim</I> switch[default OFF] state is into the [ON] state in the presence of FimB.  Although only slight decrease of fluorescence from A to B was observed, the histogram B, after expression of FimB, shows close peak fluorescence to that in histogram C (Fig.2-1-4-4).  This implies that <I>fim</I> switch[default ON] state is also inverted in some extent into the [OFF] state in the presence of FimB.  Thus we tried to confirm such inversion by colony formation using plasmid mixture extracted cell expressing FimB, and by DNA sequencing of each plasmid obtained from each colony.  Fig.2-1-4-5 and Fig.2-1-4-6 clearly shows inversion from [default ON] to [OFF] state; <I>E. coli</I> harboring the [ON] fim switch plasmid glows in green fluorescence while <I>E.coli</I> harboring the [OFF] fim switch plasmid does not glow under ultra violet light.  Cells transformed by the plasmid mixture extracted from the experiment for histogram B formed two types of colonies: those with strong fluorescence and those with little background fluorescence.  Also, sequence complementarity in the specific region of the switch shows intended inversion of the switch from [ON] to [OFF].  Furthermore, the nearly equal number of the colonies between fluorescent and non-fluorescent suggest random inversion of the fim switch by FimB expression.  Similar analysis, by using the plasmid mixture extracted from the experiment for histogram C, also showed random inversion of default [OFF] plasmid.

Fig.2-1-5-4 shows tit-for-tat strategy by Prisoner A. If Prisoner B cooperated in the 1st game, Prisoner A’s option from the second game will be cooperation.  In the third game, Prisoner A’s option will be defection given that Prisoner B defected in the last game.  Prisoner A will just copy Prisoner B’s option from the previous game.  Because mutual cooperation leads to the lowest growth inhibition while mutual defection leads to the highest growth inhibition, given that the opponent also experienced the same inhibition, tit-for-tat strategy becomes the most successful strategy.</P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-5-4. </STRONG>The tit-for-tat strategy in our iterated game</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text">To realize tit-for-tat strategy in prisoner <I>coli</I>, we designed an AHL-dependent modification of the prisoner plasmid.  AHL released from the cooperation by opponent B from the previous game turns the Prisoner A plasmid into the cooperation mode (Fig.2-1-5-5).  On the contrary, defection by opponent B from the previous game causes nothing to the Prisoner A plasmid which does not produce AHL at initial defection mode.</P><P class="text">  For Prisoner A’s mirroring the option of the opponent B from the previous game, we designed C4HSL-dependent expression of FimE, which inverts the <I>fim</I> switch unidirectionally (Fig.2-1-5-5).  C4HSL released form the cooperating opponent B in the last game cause inversion of the switch and make Prisoner plasmid A produce C12HSL in the present game.  Because all of the prisoner plasmid molecules extracted from Decision making <I>coli</I> in this case can produce 3OC12HSL, Prisoner A <I>coli</I> transformed by the plasmids shows cooperation by producing 3OC12HSL.  Note that, in the presence of FimE, the <I>fim</I> switch can be inverted from [ON] to [OFF] but not from [OFF] to [ON].  Thus Prisoner plasmid A in this strategy is designed to initially have IasI-coding sequence in the opposite direction of the promoter in the [ON] switch. In the case of defection by the opponent from the previous game, the prisoner plasmid is not modified due to the absence of C4HSL from the last game, and thus does not produce 3OC12HSL, indicating mirrored defection by Prisoner A.　</P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-5-5. </STRONG>Experimental procedure and genetic circuit for tit-for-tat strategy</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3 id="5121" class="sub7">5.1.4.1.

From the histogram A and B in Fig.2-1-5-7, the peak moved backwards, indicating weakened intensity of the fluorescence in cells.  This shows that <I>fim</I> switch[default ON] state is inverted into the [OFF] state in the presence of FimE.  On the other hand, the peak hardly moved between the histograms C and D in Fig.2-1-5-7, indicating that <I>fim</I> switch[default OFF] state cannot be inverted into the [ON] state in the presence of FimE.  We tried to confirm such inversion by colony formation by each plasmid molecule and DNA sequencing.  Fig.2-1-5-8AB shows inversion from [default ON] to [OFF] state.

Dilemma game in general public</H2><P class="text">Through the dilemma game we held among students in our Policy &amp; Practices, we iGEM students realized the importance of continuously pursuing the process I nour project and, of the risk evaluation in synthetic biology as by ourselves.  Initially, opinions from public received at our presentations at school festivals motivated us to investigate the stereotypes surrounding the sustainability, safety, and security of genetic modification.  For integration of this concerned issue into our project, we designed and executed an expanded prisoner’s dilemma game played among high school and undergraduate students, who are people outside of iGEM.  The game we designed, involving payoff matrices with or without dilemma and also payoff matrices associated with the idea of GMO, has four types of payoff matrix (Fig.2-1-6-1). </P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-6-1. </STRONG>The four types of payoff matrices we designed</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text">Through execution of the games, we found that the public chose the option which seems to be affected by the stereotype: “GMO is dangerous.”  When we compared the total number of times the combination of options was selected among the participants in row 1, column 1 between Group 2 and 4’s payoff matrices (Fig.2-1-6-2), the result was 2% in Group 2, in which the idea of GMO was not associated, and 8% in Group 4, in which the idea of GMO was associated. Even though this combination of options (row 1, column 1) is not Pareto efficient, disfavor of GMO may have attracted more selections to this combination of options with less profit. (Further description is written <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Practices">here</A>).  A possible interpretation from this result is that the public’s option selection was affected by concerns for sustainability, safety, and security of genetic modification, which were not shown in the payoff matrix.  To precisely examine further on this interpretation, we would like to increase the number of subjects playing the prisoner’s dilemma game. </P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-6-2. </STRONG>Overall results of our expanded dilemma game among students </H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text">Interestingly, we found the example of a player who himself realized the irrationality of choosing the options adhered to the stereotypes of the term GMO in the middle of the iterated game.  Player B, in Fig. Fig.2-1-6-3, experienced option selection influenced by preconceptions obtained when we first explained the original Prisoner’s Dilemma scenario.  From the 4th round of the game, realizing that higher points is needed to win the game, Player B’s option became ‘use.’  So we temporarily thought of asserting that &quot;each individual’s constant thinking of whether the payoff matrix is correct or not, will lead to the increase of the score for the entire society.&quot;</P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.2-1-6-3. </STRONG>Results of a dilemma game held in between two students</H4></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text">However, from our full year experience in iGEM, we realized the necessity of verifying from a different point of view.  In other words, we realized that we researchers ourselves must also continuously reflect on the risks and costs &amp; benefits of the science we discover.  In the workshop that we attended as our initial activity in iGEM, we learned from social scientists, the danger of grounding on the deficit model, which fixes on the idea that the general public is ignorant, and the importance of the two-way dialogue between society and researchers.  From this past experience, we realized that it wasn’t the participants of the dilemma game who were misinterpreting the payoff matrix from the stereotype of the term GMO, but it might have been the members of iGEM Tokyo Tech who were misinterpreting both the costs and benefits of GMO.  The scores of our payoff matrix in the dilemma game was indeed designed from assumptions for both the costs and benefits of GMO.  Now we address that in order to understand the correct payoff matrix of technology, instead of forcing a concept that is constructed only by researchers, one-sidedly to the general public, the attitude of cooperating and thinking together with the general public, is important in social justice.（Click <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Practices">here</A> to know more about our Policy &amp; Practices）</P><DIV align="center"><DIV class="slide"><TABLE width="800px" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD><P class="text">From our full year of activities in iGEM, we realized the necessity of continuously reflecting on the risks and costs &amp; benefits of the science we discover, and verifying thus science from a different point of view as a researchers ourselves. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV><H2 id="7" class="smalltitle">7.
