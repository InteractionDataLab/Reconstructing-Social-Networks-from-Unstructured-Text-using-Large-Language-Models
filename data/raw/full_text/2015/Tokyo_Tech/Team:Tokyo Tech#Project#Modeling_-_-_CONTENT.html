Overview</H2><P class="text">In terms of design principle, the modeling greatly contributes to obtain the improved part required for the project.  We constructed the model for replication the payoff matrix, and applied the model to solve two problems found in wet lab experiments. The first application is model-based improvement of a previously existing part.  Our project requires the improvement of the previously existing part for Chloramphenicol resistance (CmR) coding sequence to decrease unintended antibiotic effect by leaky expression, because we had to diminish such effect for implementation of a payoff matrix in Prisoners’ Dilemma.  The second application is confirmation of tunability of our payoff matrix.</P><H2 id="2" class="smalltitle">2.

Modeling selected a solution for leaky expression problem</H2><H2 id="31" class="sub5">3.1. Introduction</H2><P class="text">Although our initial modeling successfully replicate the payoff matrix, Our wet lab found an unexpected leakage in the promoter. In other words, the results of the modeling we had done beforehand did not match with the results of the wet lab.  We adjusted the model to include leaky expression of CmR protein.</P><P class="text">  We then planned two modifications of the circuits, each of which is evaluated by modeling, to circumvent the effect of leaky expressions. The first modification is addition of ssrA degradation tag to the C-terminal of the chloramphenicol resistant protein (CmR).  The other is increase of Cm concentration.  We here focused on the OD of the ‘middle’ and ‘none’ growth inhibition about prisoner A for modeling.  
</P><H2 id="32" class="sub5">3.2. Modeling for the 4 different types of punishment in payoff matrix</H2><P class="text">o precisely replicate the payoff matrix, we calculated the OD of the ‘middle’ and ‘none’ growth inhibition about prisoner A , but the results of the modeling did not match with the wet lab results showing leaked expression of CmR.</P><P class="text">We calculated the OD of after 480 minutes by using the following equations (3), (5) and (10). 
We compared the result of modeling (Fig.4-1-3-1A) and wet lab (Fig.4-1-3-1B). The graph of comparision is shown at Fig.4-1-3-1.

Considering  the leakage of CmR from the result of Wet Lab</H2><P class="text">Since the results of the modeling did not match with the wet lab, assuming that there was a leakage in the promoter of the CmR, we calculated the OD considering the leakage of the promoter of the CmR, in which the results successfully matched with the wet lab.</P><P class="text">Given the result from the wet lab that the OD of ”none” and “low” hardly differs from the modeling, on the other hand, “middle” and “high” had huge difference, we assumed that the promoter is activated and CmR is produced even in the absence of AHL.</P><P class="text">Therefore, we used the equations (3) and (5) instead of (12) and (13). Therefore, we revised the following equations (10) to the following (14).</P><P class="text">We also added the equation (15), which represents the production of CmR due to the leakage of the promotor, in the absence of AHL.</P><P class="text">We compared the result of modeling (Fig.4-1-3-2A) and wet lab(Fig.4-1-3-2B).

Solution 1: Increasing the concentration of Cm</H2><P class="text">In contrast to the above models with 100 microg/mL Cm, we calculated the OD, setting the concentration of Cm to 150 microg/mL.  The results are shown in Fig.4-1-3-3. We used the equations (12) ~ (15).  Unfortunately, the OD of “high” and “middle” were decreased only for a little.  We thus decided that there was no need to run any experiments in the wet lab, since the obtained results were not positive.</P><TABLE width="940px"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><H4 class="fig"><STRONG>Fig.4-1-3-3.
