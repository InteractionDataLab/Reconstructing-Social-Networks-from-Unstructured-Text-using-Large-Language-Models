The RNA thermometers are located in the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) and block the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence by base pairing.  Translation initiating temperature allows the disconnection of the coupling of the hydrogen bonds, which block the SD sequence at low temperature.  Therefore, RNA thermometers change their conformations to the open state so that the ribosome could access the SD sequence and to initiate translation.</P>   <P class="text">We improved characterization of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1333309:Experience">BBa_K1333309</A> by <B>(1)</B> measuring the function of the part at 42ºC, <B>(2)</B> explicating the way to deal with the background derived from Negative control, <B>(3)</B> measuring with the flow cytometer. </P><P class="text">We think that this experiment is meets Gold medal criteria. <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Description">Description</A></P><H2 id="Summary" class="smalltitle">2.

Although <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:SYSU-China">iGEM 2014 SYSU-China</A> confirmed the function of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> at these temperatures, we additionally measured each sample at 42ºC, which is higher than the translation initiating temperature. </P><H3 id="fluorescence" class="sub5">3.1.

The increasing ratios of the Plac_<I>rfp</I> at 37ºC and 42ºC show that the fluorescence intensities, even without the RNA thermometer, increased dependent on temperature.  We further evaluated the increasing ratios of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> at 37ºC and 42ºC.  Compared to the increasing ratios of Plac_<I>rfp</I>, those of the Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> were higher at respective temperatures.  This comparison shows not only the increase in the fluorescence intensities dependent on temperature, (Fig. 3-7-3-1) but also the increase in the fluorescence intensities due to the function of the RNA thermometer (Table. 3-7-3-1).  The increasing ratio of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> was 1.3 times higher than that of Plac_<I>rfp</I> at 37ºC.  Furthermore, the increasing ratio of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> was 3.2 times higher than that of Plac_<I>rfp</I> at 42ºC.  These differences of the increasing ratios were dependent on the function of the RNA thermometer.  We concluded that the RNA thermometer shows higher function at 42ºC compared to 37ºC.</P><TABLE width="940 px" border="0px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="940px"><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Table. 3-7-3-1.</STRONG> The increasing ratios</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3 id="standardized3" class="sub6">3.2.2. The standardized fluorescence intensities of RFP           after subtracting the background derived from the Negative control cell</H3><P class="text3">In this section, we obtained processed fluorescence intensities by subtracting the fluorescence intensity of a negative control, the RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> (Fig. 3-7-3-1) from both the fluorescence intensities of Plac_<I>rfp</I> and Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> (Fig. 3-7-3-1), each at the same temperature.  We then obtained increasing ratios with background subtraction at 37ºC and at 42ºC by dividing the each of the processed fluorescence intensities by those at 30ºC (Table. 3-7-3-2).  The increasing ratios of the Plac_<I>rfp</I> with background subtraction at 37ºC and at 42ºC show that the fluorescence intensities increased dependently on temperature.  We evaluated the increasing ratios of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> with background subtraction at 37ºC and at 42ºC.  Compared to the increasing ratios of Plac_<I>rfp</I> with background subtraction, those of the Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> were higher at respective temperatures.  We observed again the increase in the fluorescence intensities due to the function of the RNA thermometer (Table. 3-7-3-2).  The increasing ratio of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> at 37ºC with background subtraction was 2.6 times higher than that of Plac_<I>rfp</I> at 37ºC.  Furthermore, the increasing ratio of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> with background subtraction was 6.8 times higher than that of Plac_<I>rfp</I> at 42ºC.  These differences in the increasing ratios were dependent on the function of the RNA thermometer.  We concluded that the RNA thermometer shows higher function at 42ºC compared to 37ºC.</P><TABLE width="940 px" border="0px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="940px"><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Table. 3-7-3-2.</STRONG> The increasing ratios with background subtraction</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2 id="Discussion" class="smalltitle">4. Discussion</H2><P class="text">We examined that the reason the function of the RNA thermometer was worse at 37ºC than at 42ºC was that the amount of hydrogen bonds forming RNA thermometer was not enough to change in the structure of the RNA thermometer at 37ºC.  
 	Furthermore, differences between the increasing ratios with and without background subtraction disclose the importance of background treatment.  At 30ºC, Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> wasn’t translated enough and showed little expression of RFP.  Since the fluorescence intensity of Pcon_RNA thermometer_<I>rfp</I> at 30ºC was small, the increasing ratios of the Pcon_RNA thermometer with and without background subtraction greatly differ in both 37ºC and 42ºC (Table. 3-7-4-1).  Therefore, it is important to clarify whether the background derived from Negative control was processed or not.
