1. Introduction
In order to enable prisoner colis acquire chloramphenicol resistance by receiving the corresponding AHL, we designed a signal-dependent growth system.  In our Prisoner’s Dilemma game, Prisoner A coli needs C4HSL and Prisoner B coli needs 3OC12HSL to acquire chloramphenicol resistance.  There will be difference in the growth depending on the presence of AHL.
   For precise implementation of our payoff matrix, we constructed improved parts Pcon_lasR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA, and Pcon_rhlR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA.  The growth of the prisoner colis were confirmed by measuring the optical density.

2. Summary of the Experiment
2.1. AHL-dependent CmR expression
2.1.1. C4HSL-dependent CmR expression (Prisoner A)
Fig. 3-1-2-1. C4HSL-dependent CmR expression
We confirmed the function of C4HSL-dependent CmR expression parts by measuring the optical density of the cultures containing chloramphenicol (Cm) (Fig. 3-1-2-1.). In this experiment we prepared four cells which contain different pairs of plasmids, (1), (2), (3), and (4) (Fig. 3-1-2-2.).  The four cells were cultured with or without C4HSL induction.  The optical density was measured to estimate the concentration of the cell. Cells containing (1), and (2) are the cooperating and defecting Prisoner A coli, respectively.  (3), and (4) are the pairs of plasmids of the negative control for (1), and (2), respectively.

2.1.2. 3OC12HSL-dependent CmR expression (Prisoner B)
Fig. 3-1-2-3. 3OC12HSL-dependent CmR expression
We confirmed the function of 3OC12HSL-dependent CmR expression by measuring the optical density of the cultures containing chloramphenicol (Cm) (Fig. 3-1-2-3.).  In this experiment we prepared four cells which contain different pairs of plasmids, (5), (6), (7), and (8) (Fig. 3-1-2-4.).  The four cells were cultured with or without 3OC12HSL induction.  The optical density was measured to estimate the concentration of the cell.  Cells containing (5), and (6) are the cooperating and defecting Prisoner B coli, respectively. (7), and (8) are the pairs of plasmids of the negative control for (5), and (6), respectively.

2.2. Insertion of an ssrA degradation tag to CmR
At the wet experiment of 2-1., Prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (1) and (2), showed leaky expression of CmR.  Cells grew actively even in the absence of AHL when the cell harboring the pairs of plasmids (1) and (2).  We came up with two solutions, either increasing the chloramphenicol (Cm) concentration or inserting an ssrA tag to the CmR gene, to this problem. Our modeling result shows that the influence of the leakage was not reduced by increasing the Cm concentration.  Please refer to here .
For precise implementation of our payoff matrix, suggestions from modeling allowed us to successfully solve the influence of the leakage by adding an ssrA degradation tag added to the C-terminal of the CmR protein. ((Fig. 3-1-2-5.) and (Fig.3-1-2-6.))  New pairs of plasmids (9), (10), (11) and (12) were prepared as in (Fig. 3-1-2-7.) and (Fig. 3-1-2-8.).  The growth of the Prisoner A colis and Prisoner B colis, containing the improved parts, Pcon_rhlR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA ( BBa_K1632023 ), and Pcon_lasR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA ( BBa_K1632022 ), respectively, were measured.

3. Results
3.1. AHL-dependent CmR expression
3.1.1. C4HSL-dependent CmR expression (Prisoner A)
The cell growth with and without C4HSL was measured every hour for eight hours.  (Fig. 3-1-3-1.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (1) and (3).  (Fig. 3-1-3-2.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (2) and (4).  Each Prisoner coli grew in the culture medium even without C4HSL.

Fig. 3-1-3-2. Defecting Prisoner A coli’s growth with chloramphenicol
The expression of CmR was confirmed from (Fig. 3-1-3-1.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-2.), since the prisoner coli grew in the presence of chloramphenicol (solid green line of (Fig. 3-1-3-1.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-2.)). However, the Prisoner coli also showed active growth even in the absence of C4HSL (dotted green line), in other words, the prisoner coli acquired Cm resistance independent on C4HSL induction. From this result, leakage in the promoter was expected
3.1.2. 3OC12HSL-dependent CmR expression (Prisoner B)
The cell growth with and without 3OC12HSL was measured every hour for eight hours.  (Fig. 3-1-3-3.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (5) and (7).  (Fig. 3-1-3-4.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (6) and (8).  Each Prisoner coli grew in the culture medium even without 3OC12HSL.

The expression of CmR was confirmed from (Fig. 3-1-3-3.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-4.), since the prisoner coli grew in the presence of chloramphenicol (solid green line of (Fig. 3-1-3-3.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-4.)). However, the Prisoner coli also showed active growth even in the absence of 3OC12HSL (dotted green line), in other words, the prisoner coli acquired Cm resistance independent on C4HSL induction. From this result, leakage in the promoter was expected.
3.2. AHL-dependent CmRssrA expression
3.2.1. C4HSL-dependent CmRssrA expression (Prisoner A)
The cell growth of the prisoner colis which contain the pairs of plasmids (1) – (4), (9), and (10) were measured every hour for eight hours.  (Fig. 3-1-3-5.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (1), (3) and (9).  (Fig. 3-1-3-6.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (2), (4) and (10).

Fig. 3-1-3-6. Defecting Prisoner A coli’s growth with and without an ssrA tag
From (Fig. 3-1-3-5.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-6.), prisoner coli with CmRssrA were not able to grow without C4HSL (pink open circle) while the prisoner coli expressing CmR with an ssrA tag grew (green open circle).  We confirmed that our improved parts, Pcon_rhlR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA, had expressed CmR when induced by C4HSL.
3.2.2. 3OC12HSL-dependent CmRssrA expression (Prisoner B)
The experiment was also conducted for Prisoner B.  The cell growth of the prisoner colis which contain the pairs of plasmids (5) – (8), (11), and (12) were also measured every hour for eight hours.  (Fig. 3-1-3-7.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (5), (7) and (11).  (Fig. 3-1-3-8.) shows the growth of prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (6), (8) and (12).

Fig. 3-1-3-8. Defecting Prisoner B coli’s growth with and without an ssrA tag
From (Fig. 3-1-3-7.) and (Fig. 3-1-3-8.), Prisoner coli with CmRssrA were not able to grow without 3OC12HSL (pink open circle) while the Prisoner coli expressing CmRssrA grew (green open circle).  We confirmed that our improved parts, Pcon_lasR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA, had expressed CmR when induced by 3OC12HSL.
From the results above, we can say that the leaked CmR protein was degraded immediately because of the ssrA tag added to the C-terminal of the CmR protein.  These results show the improved function of AHL-dependent CmR expression.
