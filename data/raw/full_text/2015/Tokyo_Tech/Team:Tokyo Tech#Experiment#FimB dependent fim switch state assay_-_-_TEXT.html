1. Introduction
In order to enable a prisoner coli to randomly select its option between cooperation and defection, we noticed that a fim switch(wild-type), which can invert a promoter sequence bidirectionally in the presence of FimB(wild-type) recombinase, is the part we need (Fig. 3-4-1-1).
 
Fig. 3-4-1-1. In the presence of FimB(wild-type) recombinase, the fim switch which is a promoter containing repeated DNA sequence, is inverted at random.
For implementation of Decision making coli, we newly constructed plasmid, PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ) that produces FimB(wild-type).  We also prepared two other new plasmids, BBa_K1632007 and BBa_K1632008 (Fig. 3-4-1-2). BBa_K1632012 enables arabinose-inducible expression of FimB(wild-type).  In BBa_K1632007 and BBa_K1632008 , either [ON] or [OFF] fim switch(wild-type) is placed upstream of GFP coding sequence.

2. Summary of the Experiment
Our purpose is to confirm that FimB(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) from [ON] state to[OFF] state and from [OFF] state to [ON] state (Fig.3-4-2-1). We prepared six plasmids below. We measured the fluorescence intensity from the GFP expression in the presence of arabinose. From the results, we confirmed that our fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state. From the results we also confirmed our fim switch(wild-type) is not inverted by the endogenous FimB and FimE and that FimB(wild-type) expression doesn’t affect the GFP expression. In order to confirm inversion more precisely, we also show the percentage of [ON] state with induction by arabinose and without induction. Also we show inversion in the level of DNA sequencing.

3. Results
3.1. Arabinose-dependent FimB(wild-type) expression
We tried to confirm that the fim switch is bidirectically inverted in the presence of FimB(wild-type) by using GFP as a reporter, under 4 different concentrations of arabinose. In the medium with 0 M arabinose, we supplemented the medium with 0.5 percent glucose in order to repress the leakage in the PBAD/araC promoter. Fig. 3-4-3-1 shows the histograms of the samples measured by the flow cytometer. In the results of the reporter cell (1), when the induction of FimB(wild-type) expression increases, the fluorescence intensity decreases. From this fact, we confirmed that the fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state by FimB(wild-type). From the result of the reporter cell (2), when the expression amount of FimB(wild-type) increases, the expression amount of GFP in the reporter cell (2) increases. From this fact, we confirmed that the fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [OFF] state to [ON] state by FimB(wild-type). From the results of the two reporter cells (1) and (2), we successfully confirmed that FimB(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state and from [OFF] state to [ON] state.
   The results of Positive control 1 and Negative control 1 confirmed that the endogenous FimB and FimE did not invert our fim switch(wild-type). Also, the result of Negative control 2, indicates that the expression of FimB(wild-type) do not affect GFP expression. The reason the fluorescence intensity of the Positive control 2 is increasing in proportion to the arabinose concentration is described in 4. Discussion section.

3.2. Supplemental experiments
To confirm our results that our FimB(wild-type) inverted the fim switch(wild-type) further, after scattering the samples on a plate, we counted the number of colonies in which GFP is expressed and the colonies which GFP is not expressed. After measurement of flow cytometer, we minipreped the cells culture of leftover and got plasmid mixture which contain pSB6A1 and pSB3K3 in each samples. For example, in sample (1), PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) (pSB6A1) + fim switch[default ON](wild-type)_gfp (pSB3K3), pSB6A1 represents PBAD/araC_FimB and pSB3K3 represent fim swtich[default ON](wild-type)_gfp and fim switch[default OFF](wild-type)_gfp. E. coli DH5alpha was transformed with the plasmid mixture and cultured on LB plate containing kanamycin and glucose. As a result, E. coli which at least have pSB3K3 containing fim switch[default ON]_gfp or fim switch[default OFF]_gfp form colonies. Some colonies may have both pSB3K3 and pSB6A1 plasmid. However, the fim switch(wild-type) is not inverted by the leak of recombinase because glucose repress araC that activates expression of recombinase.

The state of fim switch either [ON] or [OFF] in colonies is evaluated from fluorescence. Thus, colonies which contain fim switch[default ON] expressed GFP. On the other hand, colonies which contain fim switch[default OFF] do not express GFP. Fluorescence intensity were measured by plate reader. We also counted out the all colonies and those with fluorescence. In the results of the reporter cell (1), when inducing the expression of FimB(wild-type), the percentage of [ON] state decreased. Furthermore, from the results of the reporter cell (2), when inducing the expression of FimB(wild-type), the percentage of [ON] state increased. From the results of the two reporter cells (1) and (2), we successfully confirmed that the fimB protein inverts the fim switch(wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state and from [OFF] state to [ON] state (Fig. 3-4-3-2). This result was consistent with the histograms (Fig. 3-4-3-3).

Also, we incubated the colonies with fluorescence and those without fluorescence. We minipreped cell culture and asked DNA sequencing of each samples. Sequence complementarity in the specific region of the switch shows intended inversion of the switch from [ON] state to [OFF] state in all samples (Fig. 3-4-3-3).
4. Discussion
When the concentration of FimB(wild-type) increased by increasing concentration of arabinose, we confirmed that the fluorescence intensity decreased in both [ON] to  [OFF] process and [OFF] to [ON] process.
   The result of the reporter cell (2) shows that when the concentration of arabinose is increased to 0〜20 microM, the fluorescence intensity increases. This shows the function of FimB(wild-type) inverting the fim switch(wild-type) from [OFF] state to [ON] state. However, when the arabinose concentration is excess (5mM), the fluorescence intensity decreases (Fig. 3-4-4-1). According to [1], this is caused by the excess increase in the inversion rate of the fim switch(wild-type). When the inversion rate is too high, there is not enough time for transcription initiation. Consequently, GFP expression decreases.
 
Fig. 3-4-4-1. The histogram of reporter cell (2)
Even though there is no fim switch(wild-type) in the plasmid of Positive control 2, similar increase in fluorescence intensity dependent on the expression of FimB(wild-type) was found in our Positive control 2 (Fig. 3-4-4-2) This unpredictable increase in fluorescence intensity is caused by the decrease of dilution rate of proteins inside cells. The FimB(wild-type) expression, dependent on the arabinose induction, inhibits cell division that decreases protein concentration inside the individual cells. Therefore, the concentration of GFP in individual cell increases.
