1. Introduction
Prisoner A and B have the different growth rate because prisoner A and B produce the different protein.
The difference of the growth rate causes the problem that the replicated payoff matrix is asymmetric. The graph shown in Fig.4-2-1-1.
Fig.4-2-1-1.
We tried to solve this problem in this way of experimenting the different concentration of Chloramphenicol  in prisoner A and B. We calculated this optimized concentration of prisoner A and B by modeling.
2. Equations
We constructed the following model for this modeling.
The equations for production of CmR from AHL are the following (1), (2)
Then, the equation for the leakage of CmR is the following (3).
The equations for optical density of prisoner A and B in four damages are the following (4) ～ (11).
We determined the concentration of Chloramphenicol for prisoner A as the error of optical density of prisoner A and B in 4 damages after 8 hours fallen in±10% in this case the concentration of Chloramphenicol for prisoner B is 75µg/mL.
3. Result
In the case that the concentration of Chloramphenicol for prisoner A is 65µg/mL, the maximum absolute value of error of optical density of prisoner A and B in 4 damages is 8.1%. It can meet the conditions described in 2 .
We showed the graph of optical density after 8 hours to Fig.4-2-3-1.
