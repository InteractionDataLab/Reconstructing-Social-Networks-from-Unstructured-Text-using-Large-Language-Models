BBa_K1632012
Pbad/araC_fimB(wild-type)
FimB ( BBa_K1632010 ) is a Fim recombinase.  This is derived from the wild type MG1655.  FimB invert the fim switch in the [ON] to [OFF] direction and in the [OFF] to [ON] direction (Fig.5-3-0-1.).
From our experimental results, we confirmed that the FimB protein inverts the fim switch(wild-type) in the [ON] to [OFF] direction and in the [OFF] to [ON] direction with approximately equal probability and works ideally (Fig.5-3-0-2.).  The expression of FimB is controlled by arabinose in PBAD/araC_fimB(wild-type) ( BBa_K1632012 ).

J23100_rhlR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA
At the first stage of our wet experiment about chloramphenicol resistance(CmR), we used “rbs_CmR” ( BBa_K395160 by iGEM 2010 team Tokyo_Tech).  However, the result showed a leaky expression of CmR.  We inserted an ssrA degradation tag to the C-terminal of CmR.  In the our experiment using the Pcon_lasR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA ( BBa_K1632022 ) and Pcon_rhlR_TT_Plux_CmRssrA ( BBa_K1632023 ), we could not observe cell growth for cells that owned the ssrA-tagged plasmid, in the absence of AHL (Fig.5-3-1-1). From our experiment, CmRssrA work better than CmR without ssrA tag for our project.

fim switch[default OFF](wild-type)_gfp
We are the first team in iGEM to successfully construct both the fim switch[default ON](wild-type) and the fim switch [default OFF](wild-type) and experimented them.  These fim switch is derived from a wild type. The fim switch(wild-type) has a sigma 70 promoter which functions constitutively.  We submitted two parts, one in the [default ON] ( BBa_K1632004 ) and the other in the [default OFF] ( BBa_K1632005 )(Fig.5-3-2-1). The fim switch (wild-type) is inverted by two recombinases, FimB ( BBa_K1632010 ) and FimE ( BBa_K1632011 ).  Therefore, we can regulate the expression of the gene downstream of the fim switch (wild-type) by adding the Fim recombinase.  From our results of experiment, they work ideally (Fig.5-3-2-2 and Fig.5-3-2-3).

fim switch[default OFF](Tokyo_Tech/J23119)_gfp
We designed another fim switch with a standardized interchangeable promoter, fim switch (Tokyo_Tech).  A difference between the fim switch (wild-type) and the fim switch (Tokyo_Tech) is that we replaced the sigma 70 promoter to the J23119 promoter" ( BBa_J23119 ) and two restriction enzyme cut sites are added in each side of the promoter.(Fig.5-3-3-1).   Due to this addition of the restriction enzyme cut sites, we were able to replace the J23119 promoter ( BBa_J23119 ) in the fim swtich (Tokyo_Tech).  There is an example. fim switch [default ON] (Tokyo_Tech/R0010) ( BBa_K1632006 ) is made by removing the J23119 promoter ( BBa_J23119 ) and inserted Plac promoter ( BBa_R0010 ) (Fig.5-3-3-2) .

FimE is a Fim recombinase.  This Fim recombinase is derived from the wild type MG1655.  FimE invert the fim switch from in the [ON] to [OFF].  The expression of these Fim recombinases are controlled by AHL in Pcon_lasR_TT_Plux_fimE(wild-type)( BBa_K1632018 ) and Pcon_rhlR_TT_Plux_fimE(wild-type)( BBa_K1632019 ).
