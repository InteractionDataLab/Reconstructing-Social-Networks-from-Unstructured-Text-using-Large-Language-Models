1. Introduction
We genetically engineered two prisoner coli, Prisoner A and Prisoner B.  They are able to cooperate or to defect.  The genetic circuits, with the improved chloramphenicol resistance protein(CmR) part, of Prisoner A and B are shown in Fig. 3-2-1-1.  Our goal in this project is to replicate the payoff matrix (Fig. 3-2-1-2) with the four types of growth inhibition.  Using the improved plasmids we constructed, our E.coli version payoff matrix is replicated through wet experiments.

2. Summary of the Experiment
2.1. Replicating the Payoff Matrix of Prisoner A coli
The cell growth of the prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (1) and (2), as shown in the following (Fig. 3-2-2-1.), in the lower chloramphenicol (Cm) concentration (75 microg/mL) were measured and the payoff matrix was replicated.

2.2. Replicating the Payoff Matrix of Prisoner B coli
We have prepared new pairs of plasmids, (3) and (4), as shown in the following (Fig. 3-2-2-2.).  The cell growth of the prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (3) and (4), under 75 microg/mL chloramphenicol and also under 1nM 3OC12HSL, were measured and the payoff matrix was replicated.

Using the pair of plasmids we constructed, our E.coli version payoff matrix with the four types of growth inhibition was replicated through wet experiments.  The cell growth of the prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (3) and (4), grown under 75 microg/mL chloramphenicol and also under 1nM 3OC12HSL, were observed.
3. Results
3.1. Replicating the Payoff Matrix of Prisoner A coli
The cell growth of the prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (1) and (2) in the lower chloramphenicol (Cm) concentration (75 microg/mL) were measured after an eight hour incubation.  The payoff matrix was replicated as the following.

3.2. Replicating the Payoff Matrix of Prisoner B coli
The cell growth of the prisoner colis containing the pairs of plasmids (3) and (4),under 75 microg/mL chloramphenicol and also under 1nM 3OC12HSL, were measured.  The payoff matrix was replicated as the following.
