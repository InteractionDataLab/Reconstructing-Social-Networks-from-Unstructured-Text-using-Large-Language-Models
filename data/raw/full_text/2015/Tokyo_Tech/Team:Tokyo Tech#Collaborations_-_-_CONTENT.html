By calculating the sufficient amount of culture fluid of <I>E.coli</I> which produce Geraniol to preserve food in a certain lunch box.
The project is about making a method of preserving food not by cooling but by flavor, ‘KOZOKO: Flavorator'. </P><H3 class="sub5">Setting the situation and Method</H3><P class="text2">We assumed a situation and constructed a model that we were preserving rice in a certain lunch box and laying the “Geraniol sheet” which contains concentrated Geraniol produced by <I>E.coli</I> on the bottom of the lunch box.   The size of the lunch box was 10W×10D×4H. Rice was packed and the ‘Geraniol sheet’ was laid on the bottom of the lunch box. The “Geraniol sheet” was 8W×8D×0.2H. The sheet contained concentrated Geraniol produced by <I>E.coli</I> in a culture fluid.    As we laid the “Geraniol sheet” on the bottom of the lunch box, Geraniol contained in the sheet started to diffuse. We calculated the least concentration of Geraniol in the sheet in order to have the Geraniol concentration be above the effective bactericidal concentration even after laying the sheet for 24hours.</P><H3 class="sub5">Results</H3><TABLE width="940 px" border="0px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="940px"><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Fig. 7-5-1-1.</STRONG>The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=0[mm]</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="940 px" border="0px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="940px"><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Fig. 7-5-1-2.</STRONG>The State of Diffusion in the yz Plain at x=50[mm]</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="940 px" border="0px"><TBODY><TR><TD width="940px"><H4 align="center" class="fig"><STRONG>Fig. 7-5-1-3.</STRONG>The State of Diffusion in the xy Plain at z=40</H4></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text2">We use the culture fluid that <I>E.coli</I> were incubated for 48 hours.

However, the advice we received from Team Nagahama helped us a lot. We would like to say thanks to all the help we received from them.</P></DIV><DIV class="textarea"><H2 class="smalltitle">May Festival</H2><H4 class="text"><P>
The Japanese iGEM teams took part in the school festival at the University of Tokyo.
Our teams shared ideas and gave each other feedbacks. Together, we introduced synthetic biology to the public.
See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Practices">“Policy &amp; Practices”</A> page for further information.

We exchanged ideas about each other’s project and gave each other feedbacks.
The iGEM LZU-China team also participated in our “Prisoner’s Dilemma Experiment” that we conducted. This experiment is a sociological experiment concerning the safety of genetic modification and is part of our “Policy &amp; Practices”.

We are looking forward to sharing ideas with other iGEM teams. Teams will have the opportunity to present their projects and exchange their ideas in details with other iGEM teams and faculty advisors right before the Giant Jamboree.
