1. Introduction
To confirm the function of the fim switch in the presence of FimE(wild-type), we constructed two Biobrick parts, BBa_K1632013 (Fig. 3-5-1-1). BBa_K1632013 enables arabinose-inducible expression of the FimE(wild-type).  In BBa_K1632007 and BBa_K1632008 , either the fim switch [default ON] or the fim switch [default OFF] is placed upstream of the GFP coding sequence.

2. Summary of the Experiment
Our purpose is to confirm that FimE(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) from [ON] state to [OFF] state and from [OFF] state to [ON] state. We prepared six plasmids below (Fig.3-5-2-1). We measured the fluorescence intensity from the GFP expression in the presence of arabinose. From the results, we confirmed that our fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state and [OFF] state to [ON] state. From the results we also confirmed our fim switch(wild-type) is not inverted by the endogenous FimB and FimE and that FimE(wild-type) expression doesn’t affect GFP expression. In order to confirm inversion more precisely, we also show the percentage of [ON] state with induction by arabinose and without induction. Also we show inversion in the level of DNA sequencing.

3. Results
3.1. Arabinose dependent FimE(wild-type) expression
We tried to confirm that fim switch(wild-type) is predominantly inverted in the presence of FimE(wild-type) by using GFP as a reporter, under 4 different concentrations of arabinose. In the medium with 0 M arabinose, we supplemented the medium with 1.0 percent glucose in order to repress the leakage in the PBAD/araC promoter. Fig. 3-5-3-1 shows the histograms of the samples measured by the flow cytometer. In the results of the reporter cell (1), when the induction of FimE(wild-type) expression increases, the fluorescence intensity decreases. From this fact, we confirmed that the fim switch(wild-type) is inverted from [ON] state to [OFF] state by FimE(wild-type). From the result of the reporter cell (2), even when the expression amount of FimE(wild-type) increases, the expression amount of GFP in the reporter cell (2) does not change. From this fact, we confirmed that the fim switch(wild-type) is inverted only from [ON] state to [OFF] state by FimE(wild-type). From the results of the two reporter cells (1) and (2), we successfully confirmed that FimE(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) only from [ON] state to [OFF] state.
   The results of Positive control 1 and Negative control 1 confirmed that the endogenous FimB and FimE did not invert our fim switch(wild-type). Also, the result of Positive control 2 and Negative control 2, indicates that the expression of FimE(wild-type) do not affect GFP expression.

3.2. Supplemental experiments
To confirm our results that our FimE(wild-type) inverted the fim switch(wild-type) further, after scattering the samples on a plate, we also counted out the all colonies and those with fluorescence. Also we show inversion in the level of DNA sequencing.
   After measurement of flow cytometer, we minipreped the cell culture of leftover and got plasmid mixture which contain pSB6A1 and pSB3K3 in each samples. For example, in sample (1), PBAD/araC_fimE(wild-type) (pSB6A1) + fim switch[default ON](wild-type)_gfp (pSB3K3), pSB6A1 represents PBAD/araC_fimE and pSB3K3 represent fim swtich[default ON](wild-type)_gfp and fim switch[default OFF](wild-type)_gfp. E. coli DH5alpha was transformed with the plasmid mixture and cultured on LB plate containing kanamycin and glucose. As a result, E. coli which at least have pSB3K3 containing fim switch[default ON](wild-type)_gfp or fim switch[default OFF](wild-type)_gfp form colonies. Some colonies may have both pSB3K3 and pSB6A1 plasmid. However, the fim switch(wild-type) is not inverted by the leak of recombinase because glucose repress araC that activates expression of recombinase.
Fig. 3-5-3-2. Determination of percentage of [ON] state and colony formation using plasmid mixture extracted cell expressing FimE(wild-type).
The state of fim switch(wild-type) either [ON] state or [OFF] state in colonies is evaluated from fluorescence. Thus, colonies which contain fim switch[default ON](wild-type) expressed GFP. On the other hand, colonies which contain fim switch[default OFF](wild-type) do not express GFP. Fluorescence intensity were measured by plate reader. We also counted out the all colonies and those with fluorescence. In the results of the reporter cell (1), when inducing the expression of FimE(wild-type), the percentage of [ON] state decreased dramatically. On the other hand, from the results of the reporter cell (2), when inducing the expression of FimE(wild-type), the percentage of [ON] state remained being small. From the results of the two reporter cells (1) and (2), we successfully confirmed that FimE(wild-type) inverts the fim switch(wild-type) predominantly from [ON] state to [OFF] state (Fig. 3-5-3-2). This result was consistent with the histograms (Fig. 3-5-3-1).

Also, we incubated the colonies with fluorescence and those without fluorescence. We minipreped cell culture and asked DNA sequencing of each samples. Sequence complementarity in the specific region of the switch shows intended inversion of the switch from [ON] state to [OFF] state in all samples (Fig. 3-5-3-3).
