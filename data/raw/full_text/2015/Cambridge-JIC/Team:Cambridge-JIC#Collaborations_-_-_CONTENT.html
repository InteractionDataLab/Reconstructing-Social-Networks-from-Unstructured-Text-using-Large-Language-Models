Their constructs are being used for the Interlab Measurement study. As part of the measurement track the W&amp;M team assembled fluorescent constructs, and measured and reported their fluorescence. The samples were sent to us to confirm the correct assembly of the parts by validating their fluorescence. Their interest in seeing how their constructs performed (in terms of fluorescent output) perfectly matched our own need to test OpenScope on cell samples rather than fluorescent beads. In addition, optical components were obtained to extend our imaging capabilities to both GFP and RFP. In particular, RFP imaging has not been tested previously. </P><P>The W&amp;M team were kind enough to send us dried DNA samples containing constructs for GFP and RFP expression in <I>E. coli</I>.

It was therefore beneficial for them to have an independent group analyse the bacterial expression of their constructs, and for us to have some living fluorescent samples to image. Specifically, the bacterial transformants they supplied were reported to have the following phenotypes: </P><UL class="RFPlist"><LI><P>DH5α - No antibiotic resistance, no fluorescence (control)</P></LI><LI><P>DH5α - Kanamycin resistance, GFP and RFP fluorescence (in the same cell)</P></LI><LI><P>DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, RFP fluorescence</P></LI><LI><P>DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, GFP fluorescence</P></LI><LI><P>DH5α - Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol resistance, mostly GFP fluorescence with a small proportion of cells on the plate expressing RFP</P></LI></UL><P>Our objective was therefore twofold: firstly to test the capabilities of OpenScope in analysing bacterial samples for GFP and RFP fluorescence, and secondly to report back to Glasgow with our phenotypic analysis of their bacterial strains.</P><H4> Results:</H4><P>After preliminary testing using the RFP epi-cube, it was decided that imaging of RFP at this stage would not be possible.

The non-standard set-up (with a brighter LED) was used, and GFP expression was confirmed in p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells as expected (Fig. 3a-d). The images display an artefact of the square shape of the LED used, as there is an area of increased fluorescence in the outline of a square at the centre of the images (Fig 3c and d). </P><DIV style="float:left; margin-right: 20px"><P><I><B>Fig. 3:</B><B>a</B> Control slide (left) showing no fluorescence <B>b</B> p126.1 samples imaged using non-standard set-up  under 470nm excitation (centre left) <B>c</B> p126.1+p80.1 samples imaged using non-standard set-up showing fluorescence (centre right) <B>d</B> p126.1+p56.1 samples imaged using non-standard set-up (right).

Due to the technical limitations of OpenScope (see below), RFP could not be visualised. Hence a commercially available microscope was used to confirm RFP expression. In addition, GFP was reliably confirmed using the same microscope. Across the board, expression of the fluorescent proteins was as reported by Glasgow and W&amp;M iGEM teams. This confirms the functionality of the plasmids. </P><P>After successful visualisation of fluorescent beads labeled with GFP (Fig. 1), it was expected that OpenScope would enable visualisation of E. coli expressing GFP. However, results indicate that reliable detection was not possible using the standard set-up (single LED illumination, GFP epi-cube). Possible reasons are:</P><OL><LI><P>The fluorescent beads used are far brighter than biological samples, and therefore can be visualised with low-brightness LEDs</P></LI><LI><P>Bacterial cells are widely dispersed on a microscope slide when prepared from a liquid culture. Fluorescence can only be detected in clustered bacterial cells and colonies, therefore OpenScope cannot resolve individual fluorescent bacterial cells</P></LI></OL><P>Replacement of the 100mW LED with the 3W LED allowed visualisation of samples with reduced fluorescence intensity in the case of the p126.1, p126.+p56.1 and p126.1+p80.1 cells. The 100mW LED was sufficient only to image the J23106+I13504 samples. Overall, the results suggest that in order to reliably detect fluorescence the 3W high-power surface-mount LED is more appropriate. However, this is still not sufficiently reliable to make OpenScope useful for fluorescence screening at this stage. In addition, the artefact (image of the LED itself) seen when using the 3W LED means that the uniformity of illumination must be improved.</P><P>RFP is more challenging to image, as it has a narrow gap between the excitation (584nm) and emission (607nm).

As the Hardware track was new to this year’s competition, and being the only team following this track in the UK, we felt this would be a fantastic opportunity to introduce other teams to the track and highlight the important role of hardware in synthetic biology. 
Our workshop took the form of three stations, each covering a slightly different aspect of our project and each with a different discussion focus:</P><DIV class="factcol-container"><DIV class="factcol" style="background-color:#b1e7ad;color:#1b4f18"><H4><CENTER>Optics Bench</CENTER></H4><P>A working set-up of our first optics bench, and demonstration 3D printed material.

Discussion points:</P><UL><LI><P>Importance of, and our difficulty with, illumination</P></LI><LI><P>Remote control over Webshell</P></LI><LI><P>Epi-cube explanation</P></LI><LI><P>Stage flex-principle demonstration</P></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="factcol" style="background-color:#bde9fe;color:#123a68"><H4><CENTER>Build Your Own</CENTER></H4><P>An interactive demonstration on building our microscope from scratch. Discussion points:</P><UL><LI><P>Importance of documentation and instructions</P></LI><LI><P>Design choices</P></LI><LI><P>Discuss improvements required</P></LI><LI><P>How to use Arduino and Raspberry Pi</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><P>The entire team was involved, and this allowed members of other teams to chat and ask questions at all three stations while the equipment was being run. 
The level of enthusiasm from other team members was extremely encouraging, and we were very surprised by the number of questions about the hardware track in general. We hope that as a result of our worksop, some teams may consider it for next year’s competition. 
Perhaps one of the most important outcomes of the workshop was in raising awareness of the role of open source hardware (OSH). We emphasised the degree of collaboration and community that it fosters, in the context of our own project. Underlying this is the ability of other iGEM teams to build, modify and improve our microscope in the spirit of OSH and the competition. We invited and encouraged other team members to look at our designs, tinker with them and think about how they might alter them to fit their specific needs.
