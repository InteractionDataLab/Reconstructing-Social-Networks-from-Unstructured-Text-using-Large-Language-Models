Microscopy Server
Turn your Raspberry Pi into a web-accessible microscope.
Look and control your microscope from your computer, phone, table or with a monitor connected to the Pi itself. You can connect to the microscope just like another computer over SFTP. After installing WinSCP (Windows) or Cyberduck (Mac) or Nautilus (Linux), it is easy to connect to the Pi (default username: pi, password: raspberry). Download your images as if they were on another folder.
Our software runs on nginx, a widely used lightweight web server. Behind this, we run an image streamer ( mjpg-streamer ) and our own python scripts. nginx deals with the user control and load balancing, leaving us to implement the various features of our microscope.

Never get lost on your slide again. MicroMaps performs image stitching in the background, allowing you to navigate your slide, just like exploring an online map.

OpenScope integrates with your favourite image processing tool.
For many years, scientists have used ImageJ for image processing. Our ImageJ plugin allows you to remotely connect to  and control OpenScope, while also letting you take pictures and import them straight into ImageJ.
One click, no hassle.
