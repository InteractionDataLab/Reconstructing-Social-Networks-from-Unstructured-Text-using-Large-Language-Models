In this sense the two hardware licenses (CERN and TAPR) are similar. The most significant difference between the TAPR OHL and the CERN OHL is that the TAPR OHL attempts to deal directly with the patent aspect of hardware licensing, and currently is the only license to do so [1]. As mentioned previously, the aspects of hardware such as manufacture and use mean that it is not covered by copyright, and instead must be regulated under patent law*.</P><P>This makes the license extremely powerful if the original creator of the hardware patented their creation: they can waive their IP rights under the license and provide full access to products and derivatives. However, a problem arises when the Licensor does not have patent rights over the creation [1]. The cost and complexity of obtaining a patent is a significant obstacle that the creator must attempt to overcome if they want to patent their creation. If anyone else asserts IP rights over the creation under license, and is awarded a patent, then access to the creation is no longer universal under the TAPR OHL.</P><P>Ultimately the choice is yours: the TAPR OHL is particularly effective if the patent rights for the original work belong to the licensor, but it also has its drawbacks. As a license TAPR is older, but the CERN OHL has the backing of a strong community of physicists and does not deal as directly with patent rights.</P><P style="font-size:80%">* A reminder: copyright covers creative works such as designs, diagrams, software and other documentation.

It is a microcontroller that is programmed through the Arduino software IDE (<A href="https://www.arduino.cc/" class="blue">arduino.cc</A>).</P><P><B>CAD</B> – Computer Aided Design. The use of computer programs to make high precision 2D and 3D designs.</P><P><B>CERN OHL</B> – An open hardware license developed and used by CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) based on Copyleft principles.</P><P><B>Compatibility</B> – An issue that arises when different licenses have conflicting requirements that prevent them from being combined.   A particularly common issue with software.</P><P><B>Copyleft</B> – A license type that allows products, designs and software to be released freely for modification, distribution and use. Any derivatives must be licensed under the same conditions.</P><P><B>Copyright</B> – A legal right that gives the creator of a design, artistic work or software exclusive rights to its use and distribution. In most cases they last for a limited amount of time.</P><P><B>Creative Commons</B> - A global non-profit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools (<A href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="blue">CC Wiki</A>).</P><P><B>Git</B> – a revision control system created by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel. It allows modifications to be tracked and recorded.</P><P><B>Github</B> – An online Git repository that has a number of additional features to version control such as a graphical interface (<A href="https://github.com/" class="blue">github.com</A>).</P><P><B>GPL</B> – General Public License. The most widely used free software license, and the first Copyleft license released for general use.</P><P><B>License</B> – A permit for an activity that would otherwise be illegal. This can include distributing, using or modifying another’s designs or products.</P><P><B>Licensee</B> – A person exercising their rights under the license.</P><P><B>Network Protective</B> – A form of Copyleft license that has provisions for the use of software over a computer network. Code must be made available for people accessing the network.</P><P><B>Open-source</B> - Hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design (<A href="http://www.oshwa.org/" class="blue">OSHWA</A>).</P><P><B>OSHWA</B> – Open-source Hardware Association. An organisation that provides information and best practices for releasing open-source hardware.</P><P><B>Patent</B> – Recognition from the government for an inventor to have exclusive rights to make, use and sell the invention. Usually lasts for a limited amount of time.</P><P><B>PCB</B> – Printed Circuit Board. A board that connects electronics components using conductive tracks on an insulating board.</P><P><B>Permissive License</B> – An open-source hardware license that permits derivatives of the product to be made proprietary.</P><P><B>Proprietary</B> – A product privately owned by an individual or corporation under patent or trademark, and therefore not open to be modified, remixed or redistributed.</P><P><B>Strongly Protective</B> – A form of Copyleft license that adheres to all the standards of the Copyleft principles.</P><P><B>TAPR OHL</B> – An open hardware license developed and used by Tucson Amateur Packet Radio under the principles of Copyleft.</P><P><B>Viral</B> - A pejorative term for Copyleft licenses, referring to Copyleft licensed code ‘infecting’ proprietary software.</P><P><B>Weakly Protective</B> - A form of Copyleft license that has elements of a Permissive license. Computer code cannot be made proprietary, but can be made part of a larger proprietary program.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="footer-sec"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row  pad-bottom"><DIV class="col-md-3"><H4><STRONG>ABOUT US</STRONG></H4><P>
