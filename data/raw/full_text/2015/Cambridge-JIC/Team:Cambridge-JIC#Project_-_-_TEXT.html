Cambridge-JIC brings you OpenScope: the foundation to a new era of accessible microscopy.
Reducing cost
Increasing openness
Implementing software
3D printing components
Learn More
The environmental impact of OpenScope has been analysed to identify the consequences of its use
The features of commercially available and open-source microscopes are compared to those of OpenScope to contextualise its capabilities
The potential for future integration into other hardware projects is considered, and the modularity of the microscope is explored
Learn More
Choose between different features using our modular design. Find out the parts you'll need, their cost, and where we sourced them
Use the manual stage or go fully motorised for remote control
Capture  images under brightfield, darkfield and fluorescence
See More
All of our downloads. All in one place.
Find all the files you need to make your OpenScope, and so much more
Downloads mean that you can access the information about OpenScope offline.
They also provide more experimental detail about our project
