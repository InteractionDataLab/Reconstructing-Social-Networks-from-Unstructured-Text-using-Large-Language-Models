Atti
Never seen anywhere without his factor 50 suncream, he represents the token biologist on the iGEM team. His degree in biology makes him perfectly placed to make coffee and do the colouring-in when required. He studies Natural Sciences with specific interests in biochemistry and organic chemistry.
Katerina
Featured on the current Interpol most wanted list as an international assassin, as well as Gardening Weekly’s list of top bonsai cultivators. She has also appeared on EuroVision. In her free time, she studies Natural Sciences. Her specific interests include physics and biological sciences.
Lorenzo
One of the key negotiators in the recent Iran-US nuclear talks, Lorenzo is 80 kg of Iranian-Italian hybrid steel. He can go from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds, making him the inspiration for the Rihanna song ‘Shut Up and Drive’. Lorenzo studies engineering, with specific interest in information and bioengineering.
María
Raised by wolves until the age of 16. She often disappears around the full moon period and was once spotted howling at the sky. Fearing the return of her wolf family, she has installed stringent security measures in her house, including cameras in every room. She studies Bioengineering and, when not full mooning, can usually be found reading a book.
Ocean
noun. a very large expanse of sea, in particular each of the main areas into which the sea is divided geographically. Studies Natural Sciences specifically physics and computer sciences, and enjoys playing the violin in his spare time. His life story was the inspiration for the film ‘Ocean’s Eleven’.
Olivia
When she’s not cage fighting and practicing her MMA skills, Olivia can be found roaming the Siberian wastelands searching for prey. She studies Engineering, with a particular interest in Bioengineering.
Rajiv
The second person in history to reach the North Pole. He’s also rumored to have defeated Napoleon in single combat. Rajiv studies Engineering, and cultivates his mushroom garden in his spare time. It is rumoured that he is the true identity of Batman, although this has not been proven.
Simon
Enjoys a Fosters with the boys, dingo hunting and the occasional wombat stew. Do ask him to show you the scar where a bull shark tried to eat his foot. When he’s not surfing on Bondi beach and being featured on the latest cover of Men’s Health magazine, Simon studies Natural Sciences. He is interested in Biochemistry, Physics and Computer Science.  Loves 3D printing (in massive amounts).
Souradip
Inventor of the wheel, the telephone and also the internet, Souradip is a true alchemist at heart. He was once described as a “top bloke” by his contemporary Aristotle ca. 200 BC. Pursued by Interpol for hacking into MakeSpace, his current disguise is as a Medic. Unbeknownst to him, he drops this guise when given some electronics to program.
Will
Simon’s mysterious doppelganger. Shares very similar research interests with Simon and is never seen in the same room with him, leading some to believe that they are actually the same person. Will studies Natural Sciences, with specific interest in Biochemistry and Mathematics. He intends to create the biologically inspired version of Skynet when he does his PhD.
Tobey
Maverick physicist. Very little is know about Tobey's past, save that his birth coincided with the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 C.E. Speculation has lead some to conclude that he is in fact the reincarnation of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten.
Kate
Kate, along with Watson and Crick, was one of the lead discoverers of the deep fried Mars bar. It was this discovery that led her to Glasgow, the spiritual home of deep fried chocolates. She has since shifted her interests to Cancer Research, and is currently carrying out her PhD at the University of Glasgow into the relationship between Epstein Barr virus and cancer.
Jim
On the seventh day, Jim created Marchantia as a model organism. From here sprung the entire field of synthetic biology and the religion Scientology. Jim has studied more ‘ologies’ than you’ve had hot dinners, and is rumoured to have read every journal article ever written. In his down time, Jim likes to listen to The Ride of the Valkyries on repeat while repotting his liverworts.
