We would like to thank our supervisor, advisors, and the many people who have generously shared their time and expertise with us, and without whom this project would not have been possible, let alone finished in time…
Special thanks to:
Dr Richard Bowman, NanoPhotonics Center, University of Cambridge
For inspiring our entire project, and providing the basis for our microscope stage with his PiScope (an open-source, inverted, bright-field microscope). See here for more information about PiScope [1].
Prof Jim Haseloff, Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge
For his support and patience as our PI. Particularly for organising consultation meetings, logistics and helping at every step of the way.
Kate Armfield, PhD student, University of Glasgow
For being a wonderful full-time advisor, who has helped us in all aspects of our project, including logistics, press releases and lab supervision.
Barbara Landamore, Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge
For helping with risk assessments and lab protocols, and sourcing key materials.
Dr George Sirinakis and Dr Alex Sossick, Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge
For their advice on how to improve the optical performance of our microscope.
Prof. Dale Sanders, Head of the John Innes Centre, and Prof. Duncan Maskell, Head of the School of Biological Sciences, University of Cambridge
For enthusiastic leadership and generous support.
BBSRC/EPSRC OpenPlant Synthetic Biology Research Centre
For funding support.
Tobias Wenzel, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge
For his constant guidance with optical pathway design and illumination.
Luka Mustafa, Shuttleworth Fellow, IRNAS
For his appraisal of our hardware design and advice on custom PCBs.
Bernardo Pollak, Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge
For his assistance with samples for imaging, and advice about Marchantia.

Open Source Projects
Software
Below is a list of software programs that we have found useful for developing open-source documentation, supplemented with other commonly used programs:
OpenSCAD – a free, open-source, parametric CAD platform used to design 3D objects for printing (available from here )
Tracker – a free, open-source, video analysis and modelling tool. Used to track moving objects in videos and extract data (available from here )
Cura 3D – a free, open-source 3D printer interface from Ultimaker. Used to control printer settings (available from here )
Fiji - a free, open-source image processing and analysis platform. Particularly useful for microscopy (available from here )
Inkscape – a free, open-source vector graphics package. Extremely useful for 2D design followed by linear extrusion (available from here )
DesignSpark – a free electronics design software for PCB prototyping. Has an online library of over 80,000 parts (available from here )
Scribus – a free, open-source graphics software. Particularly useful for publishing (available from here )
Python – a free, open-source, programming language that allowed us to put together software quickly
Nginx – A FOSS lightweight web server on top of which we built our web interfaces.
OpenCV – A FOSS released under a BSD license that provides a library for image processing software (available from here )
For a detailed list of free, open-source software programs available, look here .
Hardware
Arduino – A low-cost, open-source microprocessor with a number of available add-ons. Includes its own specific programming software and language (available here ).
Raspberry Pi – A low-cost, linux-based computer board with a wide range of compatible modules including cameras and Wi-Fi adapters (available here ).
