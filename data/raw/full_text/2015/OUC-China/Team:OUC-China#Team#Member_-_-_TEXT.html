Our team consists of 11 students and two instructors. We are from Ocean University of China (OUC) which is a comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science. We come from 5 different colleges, majoring in biology, biotechnology, ecology, bioengineering, aquiculture, mathematics and industrial design.
In the processing of iGEM, we are trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. And we will never forget the time we fight together. Because, it was the best of times, it was the hardest of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of busyness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of disappointment, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of attraction, it was the summer of fever, we had nothing before iGEM, we had everything after iGEM.

For a long time, I've been long to do researches. However, I have no idea what research is, just a vague notion. During this competition, especially when facing puzzles and racking our brains to handle them, I got
to know what do I really like.

This year I joined in the team and got the unforgettable experience in my college life.It's impressive to learn things and solve problems together with a group of conscientious people, as I expected before participation.

The mainspring that I take part in the competition is that almost all of my friends in OUC decided to enjoy it at that time, I was sitting around and want to play with them. But
I find that I acquired much more than expect
in this year.

I wanted to do something with my dear friends in a brand-new field. The synthetic biology for me was a field I never touched or even heard before I joined in this team. What made me excited was that I could do the dry lab work as a student major in biology. Though it was a challenge for me in constructing modeling, I still did this with passion.

Joining in our team and meeting iGEM gave me a fantastic summer. I have found great friends, maybe important in the rest of my life, and also the direction I may move on in the future. I think I will remember forever the time we worked together.

Comments on iGEM:iGEM is not only a good platform for undergraduste to experience the process of scientific research,but also an original way to attract more people to understand Synthetic Biology.I really liefly encourage our team members to take part in iGEM,which is based on their enthusiam.
