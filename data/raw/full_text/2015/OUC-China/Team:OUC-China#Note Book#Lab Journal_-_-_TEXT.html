Week 1 (April21 – April 26)
Wet Lab Overview
To achieve the expected results we discussed and proposed four plans: A) Free ferritins combined with RNA thermometer. B) MTS (Membrane Targeting Sequence)-Ferritins combined with Two Component System. C) Free ferritins combined with free inteins. D) A fusion of ferritin subunit and intein. For Mag-receiver and Thermo-regulator, we chose to construct ferritin ftnA and RNA thermometer first.
Mag-receiver
To obtain ftnA gene by PCR, Top 10 cells were cultured in LB liquid medium. After failing in PCR for several days, Jinyang Liang and Qikai Qin decided to extract genome DNA from Top 10 instead of doing PCR directly.
Fig.1. Lane 7 is DL 2000 marker. Lane 1-6 are PCR peoducts(ftnA) cloned from Top 10, used different concentrations of culture. The Agarose gel electrophoresis shows bands between 500bpand750bp, the target sequence band is expected at 500bp. The sequencing results validated the correctness of the PCR products.
Qikai Qin tried to assemble ftnA into T-vector, then Cun Wei and Renjie Shang transformed the plasmids into Top 10 cells to amplificate ftnA gene. It’s a pity that there were false positive phenomenon when using blue-white screen.
Thermo-regulator
The experiments were designed to test the performance of three alternative RNA thermometers.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part)After setting our four plans, we started to search for references about ferritin and nanoparticles. We wanted to find a specific method to calculate the heating power of the ferritins and adjust it into our project.
(Device Part)For the need of electromagnetic field, we decided to make a device to generate it.
Week 2 (April 27 – May 3)
Wet Lab Overview
This week we decided to insert ftnA gene into plasmid pET-28a, because pET-28a is a high expression plasmid. We found that the Amp was ineffective, that’s why the transformation of T-vector was failed. The ftnA gene was inserted into T-vector because double digest experiment of PCR products was unsatisfactory.
We started constructing RNA thermometer circuits.
Mag-receiver
Qikai Qin extracted plasmid pET-28a.
Qikai Qin and Jinyang Liang repeated the PCR, digested the pET-28a and PCR products (ftnA) with BamHI and HindIII-HF, assembled the enzyme-digested products, and transformed the plasmids. PCR identification proved that the experiment failed. We thought that we should purified the enzyme-digested products before ligation.
Jinyang Liang extracted plasmid pET-28a.
After finding the Amp was ineffective, Cun Wei and JieLian repeated the ligation of ftnA and T-vector and transformation. Blue colony appeared on the plate. Renjie Shang and Jinyang Liang inoculated white colonies into LB liquid medium for digestion to identify the ligation.

This week we successfully assembled the K115001 with E1010, K115002 with E1010, and K115003 with E1010. There are two reasons why we failed for previous experiments: a) we used buffer as assemble because of the wrong tag. b) The ligation system was incorrect, we summarized that the appropriate proportion of backbone and part is 10:1.
Mag-receiver
JieLian and Qingdian Mu continued constructing pET-28a in case that the first batch was false positive.
Renjie Shang and Jinyang Liang did PCR to identificate the correctness of pET-ftnA.

Zhuo Pan digested J, K1, K2 and K3 with SpeI and PstI, digested E and K1E with XbaI and SpeI. Ligations of J and K1E, E and K1, K2, K3 were down by Cun Wei after gel extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Transformation was down by Zhuo Pan. Only K3E grew on the plate and the PCR identification shows that the ligation of E and K1 last week is failed. Cun Wei did PCR identification of K3E, there are no target bands on the gel.
Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did gel extraction of K1, K3, J and E which had been digested. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did two ligations respectively. Both transformations were failed.
We found the problem of assemble, and ordered new T4 assemble. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan did four groups of transformation: a) competent cells was spread on the plate without antibiotic. b) Plasmid was transformed into competent cells. c) Product of ligation was transformed into competent cells. d) The product of digestion was transformed into competent cells. Bacterium of a), b) and c) grew on the plate. This shows that the double enzyme digest and transformation has no problems.
Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan digested a lot of K1, K2, K3 and E. Ligation was down after gel extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Cun Wei and Zhuo Pan transformed product of ligation into DH5α competent cells. Bacterium of all experimental groups grew on the plate.

The sequencing proved the correctness of pET-ftnA.
This week we prepared and tested lab instrument about expressing protein and SDS PAGE.
Jingyang Liang cultured BL21 cells containing pET-ftnA, induced and biomineralized ferritin simultaneously. The strains were prepared for SDS PAGE.
Jinyang Liang harvested the biomineralized strains, resuspended them with PBS, and broke up cells by ultrasound. SDS PAGE was down to identify the ferritin expression in supernatant and sediment. The results shows that the bands stand for sediment is more wider than supernatant, that is, ferritins stayed most in sediments after breaking up cells.
Thermo-regulator
The sample was sent to sequencing, the results match the correct sequences except for K2E.
Cun Wei repeated ligation of K2E.

Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part)With the result from ferritin’s deterministic model’s the first simulation, we got an approximate amount of ftnA molecules in the steady state. Then Ruipeng Wei started to establish the deterministic model with ODEs based on mass-law and Michaelis-Menten equations to describe the mechanism of T7 platform.
(Device Part)Weiyan Chen tested the circuit built last week, it worked! So we turned to build the amplifier which can apply the sine signal onto the solenoid. So Weiyan Chen designed the amplifier circuit and simulated the expected effect on the software.

Zhuo Pan was responsible for the Gibson assembly. In this week, he consulted some papers and data about Gibson assembly and prepared materials to make the Gibson assembly Mix.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part)For the two deterministic models we did before, parameters finding and adjusting were performed to make the models more rigorous. And Ruipeng Wei did sensitivity analysis to find out which parameter hold the greatest importance in the model of T7 platform and recognized how the intein’s splicing efficiency influences the amount of reporter protein.
(Device Part)We were struck by a serious problem that we need to provide a lot of energy that cannot be afforded by such a simple amplifier to amplify the current strength. So we needed to get another way out. And it took time to search for supports and recalculate.
Week 7 (June 1 –June7)
Wet Lab Overview
pET-Ecoil-HL was under construction. The big plasmid project and double plasmids project for T7 RNAP were being designed. Gibson assembly was being prepared.

Trouble shouting but without result.
6.6
Traci toldusthe promoters they had us using (J23108, J23109, and J23111) all have two extra illegal SpeI sites in the plasmid which would make BioBrick assembly impossible.
Many thanks to Carnegie Mellon for finding this incredibly important problem.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) In order to find out whether our design of mag-receiver can work, Ruipeng Wei and Weiyan Chen simulated the temperature field around one single ftnA molecule. But unfortunately result showed no optimism. So we then searched deeply and got several new formulas to calculate temperature transmission.
(Device Part)For the sake of watching fluorescence better, Qikai Qin and Weiyan Chen decided to make a box named “Blue Light Generator” just for this usage. Qikai Qin ordered the blue LEDs whose wavelength is around 450 nm. The 450nm light is the second excitation wavelength of GFP, under which wavelength the GFP can stabilize for more minutes. At the meantime, Weiyan Chen and Ruipeng Wei made a solenoid.
Week 8 (June 8 –June14)

(Device Part)This week we got two opposite news, one is that we went well on the fluorescence-watching box; while the bad news is that we finally found it impossible for us to build an amplifier with such a high power.
Week 9 (June 15 –June21)
Wet Lab Overview
This week we designed primers that would be used to construct T7 platform. The total project for experiments was formed.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) Because protein molecules are randomly distributed in the cell and move around stochastically, Weiyan Chen and Ruipeng Wei added a parameter normally distributed in (0,1) onto the equations to describe molecules’ movement in every some time interval and calculated the temperature field of the whole cell again. But after debugging for several times we found it did not show a good result yet.
(Device Part)Weiyan Chen investigated several companies who produce the signal generator and amplifier, and visited many senior advisorsand professors to solve the problem about high power.
In the meanwhile, Qikai Qin and Weiyan Chen successfully made the device of observing the GFP or RFP. The Blue Light Generator was born this week.
Week 10 (June 22 –June28)
Wet Lab Overview
We stopped all experiments to prepare the final exam.
Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) This week, wet lab members have found ferritin’s unexpected leakage. We consider it to be the lacI binding sites on the PQE vector that caused the problem. So Ruipeng Wei used a novel method based on partition function to explain the leakage.

Xihan Zhang transformed the products into DH10B competent cells. Xihan Zhang did PCR identification. The electrophoresis shows that there are no bands when using primers VF2 and VR. However, there are target bands when using the primers designed by ourselves. It’s indicate that there are multi-sites binding exits.
Xihan Zhang and Jinyang Liang repeated the ligation and transformation. They use two pairs of primers to identify the ligation, the first pair is seg2-F and VR, the second pair is VF2 and seg2-R.
The electrophoresis shows there are target bands above 2000bp. The corresponding bacterium was inoculated to LB liquid medium containing arabinose and it fluoresced !

Dry Lab Overview
(Theory Part) From several references Ruipeng Wei concluded a theoretical formula fit for the temperature distribution calculation with stochastic movement. We did another more simulationand finally got a good result. From that we could conclude that ftnA is possible to heat the whole cell. Ruipeng Wei also did the sensitivity analysis of the ftnA’s deterministic model to find out every parameter’s importance of the model.
(Device Part)For a better view of bacteria attraction experiment, Xihan zhang designed a device made of acrylic plate whose core is a six well plate struck by six magnets. She called it “Captor beta”.

Week 14 (July 20– July26)
Wet Lab Overview
The ordered gene synthesis productions arrived. They are seg 1 to seg 5, which were used for constructing T7 platform.
Mag-receiver
Qingdian Mu did PCR identification of pQE-L*H, pQE-HL, pSB-ftnA and pSB-HL, no target bands. The sequencing of pQE-ftnA shows that the result sequence doesn‘t match the correct one.
Circuits 1 to 6 was under construction by Cun Wei and Qingdian Mu, the main problems were that more than one bands appeared after amplificating Gibson product, ligation was failed even with gel extraction.
Renjie Shang succeed in ferritin purification, proved by SDS-PAGE. To achieve an optimal induction concentration for Pet28a harboring ftnA, Jie Lian designed more IPTG concentration gradient from 0.1mM to 1mM. Considering the expression quantity and toxic damage to cell, we decided the final induction concentration as 0.8mM.
Jie Lian examined the supernate and purification product with Prussian blue staining and native-page. There was no color change for the concentration of samples was low.
Thermo-regulator
Zhuo Pan did PCR to get seg 1 to seg 5 fragments. Xihan Zhang did the agarose gel electrophoresis of five fragments and digested pSB1C3 to estimate the concentrations. Five fragment and the backbone were assembled by Gibson assembly. Xihan Zhang did the transformation and the bacterium were spread out on the plate with arabinose. The colony turned green on the plate. However, there no target bands on the gel after PCR identification. Besides, we transformed the plasmid into DH10B, the strain doesn’t turn green anymore. We failed to construct the T7 platform. We thought that there was incomplete plasmid containing GFP in E.coli, that’s why the strains turned green.

Jie Lian went on the SDS-PAGE, trying to identify an optimal IPTG concentration for pQE80l induction, but always failed for there was no apparent targeted band at 20~21kDa. For characterizing the magnetization effect, Renjie Shang added 3 milliliters of cell suspension (BL21 harboring pet28a-ftna and DH5α harboring pqe80l-ftna, bacteria were cultured in LB medium inoculated with 1mM ammonium ferric citrate to dishes above a Rubidium iron boron magnet.
The result of pet28a group was apparent while pqe80l group could see no difference. After analyzing, we speculated that ftnA can’t correctly express in the wrong host cell DH5α.
We tried more iron containing medium to incubate BL21 harboring pet28a-ftna and found that ferrous sulfate can result in more apparent pattern than ammonium ferric citrate.
Thermo-regulator
Although we had been constructing the plasmid more than one week, we didn’t get positive results. We thought that the PCR would trigger mispairing and that’s why we fail to assembled the fragments. So we started doing gel extraction to purify the products of PCR and concentrated the products with concentrator. We repeated the chart for seven times, but we still didn’t get positive results.

Cun Wei successfully constructed the pQE-ftnA in DH5α.
Qingdian Mu did three parallel experiments for constructing pQE-HL, only the first batch of bacterium grow on the plate. However, there are no bands on the gel after PCR identification. We found that the rTaq enzyme was inefficiency later.
Cun Wei was constructing pQE-L*H, there are only primer-dimers after PCR identification.
Cun Wei transformed Pqe80l-ftn from DH5αinto DH10B. After getting the sequencing data, the induction experiment was succeed with final concentration 1mM for Pqe80l.
The protocol of ni-sepharose purification was optimized. But Native-page and prussian blue staining still didn’t work.

Qingdian Mu did parallel experiments as follows.
We changed the project before PCR identifications were completed down.
Pqe80l was proved worked well. This week Jie Lian and Renjie Shang incubated bacteria with 7.125mM ferrous sulfate. However the unexpected positive results were observed in most of the control groups. We started to suspect the mag-attraction test. Jie Lian concentrated the ferritin purification product with Amicon Ultra-15ml (Millipore) and went on with Native-page and Prussian blue staining. No positive result.

Mag-receiver
Renjie Shang repeated the experiment from cultivation in Beijing, but using ammonium ferric citrate with final contrition 1mM, the SDS results were still poor and native page fail again.
Qingdian Mu returned to Qingdao, summarized the protocol of ferritin experiment, got down to doing the experiment following the new protocol. The electrophoresis device for SDS page in our lab is hard to operate, so we asked teacher Yan He for help. We were permitted to use electrophoresis device at her lab.
This week we designed a big experiment for Mag-receiver sub team. We prepared 32 Erlenmeyer flasks for the experiment , when we were going to inducing gene expression, the problem raised: the big incubator couldn’t down to 18℃. We have to abandon the original plan.
This week the main problem was that native page didn’t develop color. We speculated that the protein concentration was not enough.
The first preliminary experience prepared for ferritin concentration per cell quantification was conducted. At first Jie Lian measured the ferritin purified product prepared for adjusting the optical density quantitation protocol with BCA protein quantitation kit. But the data was not ideal because the measurement error was big.
