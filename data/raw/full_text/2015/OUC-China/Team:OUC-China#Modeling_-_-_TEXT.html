Overview
According to our project design, the modeling part also contains three modules, Magnetic Receiver, Heating, and Thermosensitive Regulator. In order to validate the feasibility of our project, we started from the simulation of ferritin’s expression quantity, and then turn to the temperature distribution calculation of single cell. With the feedback from wet lab experiments, we updated our statistics, parameters and results. From our initial simulation they also got the expect result and adjust their experiment methods.
For the third part “Thermosensitive Regulator”, we did analysis about the effect of splicing efficiency on the protein expression level. And simulated the temperature sensitivity of intein to explore the best plan of the T7 platform.
Thus, we created sub-pages for each of them to show our thoughts in detail and stored everything for recreating our model on GitHub.
In the end, we hoped our work can not only benefit our own project, but inspire more valuable ideas as well.
