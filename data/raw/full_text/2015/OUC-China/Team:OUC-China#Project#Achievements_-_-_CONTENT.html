                </P><P><B>√Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.</B>We’ve done our wiki and documented many parts using Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
                </P><P><B>√Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree</B>We’ve prepared for presentation and share our joyful summer using Poster.
                </P><P><B>√Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.</B>We’ve created a page and showed clear attribution of each aspect of our project. See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Attributions" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">Attributions</A>.
                </P><P><B>√Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.</B>We’ve documented many new parts. See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Parts" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">parts</A>.
                </P><H2>Silver Requirements (3/3)</H2><P><B>√Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6</B>We’ve validated that <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1679028" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">BBa_K1679028</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1679026" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">BBa_K1679026</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1679025" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">BBa_K1679025</A> and many other parts works as our expected.
                </P><P><B>√Participate in the Measurement Interlab Study. Submit measurement data to the committee by the study deadline.</B>We’ve participated in Interlab Study, and submitted data before deadline.
                </P><P><B>√iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. </B>We’ve successfully identified, investigated and address the shipment problems and created a good pattern for other teams.See <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Human_Practice/Transportation" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">Transportation</A> in our wiki.
                </P><H2>Gold Requirements (3/4)</H2><P><B>√Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project.</B>Except Transportation, we held 3 Camps for different target group. See Transportation and <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Human_Practice/Education" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">Education</A>.
                </P><P><B>√Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.</B>We helped NYU-Shanghai characterize PBAD and collaborated with many other teams and institutions. See <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Collaborations" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">collaborations</A>.
                </P><P><B>√Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique or a previous iGEM team measurement project.</B>We constructed Captor for easy measure of magnetism and test of optimum induce concentration, which have substantial improvement in cost and convenience. Employing Native Page test, we can accurately detect iron core in ferritin after in vivo mineralization. See <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/Captor" style="color:#0000FF;text-decoration: underline;">Captor</A>. and Magnetic Receiver
                </P><P><B>Demonstrate the ease of accessibility and/or portability of a new or existing measurement technique of your choosing. Document the use of the measurement technique in a lab other than your own on your team wiki.</B></P><H2>Best Model Requirements</H2><P>Before performing experiments, we analyzed the feasibility of our project design using our model. See more details in 
<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Modeling">modeling.</A></P><P>With the results from wet lab experiments, we gave the theoretical explanation and updated the simulation result to assist adjusting our project design. See more details in <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Modeling/Heating"> heating.</A></P><P>For the future design derived from our project, we analyzed the impact of splicing efficiency on the design and gave the principle of choosing intein with our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Modeling/Thermosensitive_Regulator"> model.</A></P><P><B>We deserve a gold medal, high score and best model !</B></P></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="container"><ADDRESS class="center-block">
