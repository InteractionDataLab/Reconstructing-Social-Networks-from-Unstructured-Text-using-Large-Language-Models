                Our team consists of 11 students and two instructors. We are from Ocean University of China (OUC) which is a comprehensive university with particular strengths in oceanography and fisheries science. We come from 5 different colleges, majoring in biology, biotechnology, ecology, bioengineering, aquiculture, mathematics and industrial design.
            </P><P>
                In the processing of iGEM, we are trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. And we will never forget the time we fight together. Because, it was the best of times, it was the hardest of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of busyness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of disappointment, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of attraction, it was the summer of fever, we had nothing before iGEM, we had everything after iGEM.
