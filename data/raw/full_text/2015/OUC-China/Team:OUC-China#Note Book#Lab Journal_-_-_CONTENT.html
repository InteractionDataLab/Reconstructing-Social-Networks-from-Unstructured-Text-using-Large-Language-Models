For Mag-receiver and Thermo-regulator, we chose to construct ferritin ftnA and RNA thermometer first.

We found that the Amp was ineffective, that’s why the transformation of T-vector was failed. The ftnA gene was inserted into T-vector because double digest experiment of PCR products was unsatisfactory.We started constructing RNA thermometer circuits.

                            (Theory Part) In order to find out whether our design of mag-receiver can work, Ruipeng Wei and Weiyan Chen simulated the temperature field around one single ftnA molecule. But unfortunately result showed no optimism. So we then searched deeply and got several new formulas to calculate temperature transmission.(Device Part)For the sake of watching fluorescence better, Qikai Qin and Weiyan Chen decided to make a box named “Blue Light Generator” just for this usage. Qikai Qin ordered the blue LEDs whose wavelength is around 450 nm. The 450nm light is the second excitation wavelength of GFP, under which wavelength the GFP can stabilize for more minutes. At the meantime, Weiyan Chen and Ruipeng Wei made a solenoid.

After getting the sequencing data, the induction experiment was succeed with final concentration 1mM for Pqe80l.The protocol of ni-sepharose purification was optimized.
