Overview
"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."
— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
This year, we tried our best to interact with the people and institutions we touched, in order to make our project have effect on them, then affect the larger range and even the whole world. Through communicating with professors, we got the most direct information about our project, including the background, research progress and contingent risks, which made us have a more profound realization on our work. Through communicating with other teams, we got a new understanding of our own project and widen our scope of knowledge. What’s more, we found our WeChat Official Account Admin Platform and facebook page to share the knowledge of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. It is a public welfare behavior that offers a convenient access for the public to know the brand new world of biology.
Another work we are proud of is transportation of biological product. An obvious matter for iGEM team is that the transportation always costs much time and money. To find a legal way to solve this problem, we consulted the officers of Qingdao Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission (QMHFPC) and Qingdao Customs District. Meanwhile, we also interviewed some express companies to know their attitudes to the personal biological product shipment. We found that many of them refused to delivery it in order to avoid the risk of policy and safety, which made it hard for iGEM team to send parts. While, we successfully solved this through cooperation with biotechnology company. And we made a protocol about the transportation which we considered it as a guidance to other teams.
Except from that, we knew the importance of education and smriti, so we held three camps for high school students, college students and 2016 pre-iGEMers, this summer. We carried on this original mission from 2011 OUC-China, and expanded on our own. Also, we summarized some matters need attention in logo design, which could be a guide for other teams.
