HiBind ® DNA Mini Columns
2 ml Collection Tubes
Binding Buffer* (XP2)
Elution Buffer
SPW Wash Buffer Concentrate
1. Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. It is strongly recommended however, that fresh TAE buffer, or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not reuse running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
2. When adequate separation of bands has occurred, CAREFULLY excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
3. Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1g/ml of gel, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3g will have a volume of 0.3 ml. Add an equal volume of Binding Buffer (XP2). Incubate the mixture at 55°C  -60°C  for 7 min or until the gel has completely melted. Mix by shaking or vortexing the tube in increments of 2-3 minutes.
4. Place a HiBind DNA Mini Column in a provided 2 ® ml collection tube.
5. Apply 700μl of the DNA/agarose solution to the HiBind® DNA Mini Column, and centrifuge at 10, 000 x g for 1 min at room temperature.
6. Discard liquid and place the HiBind® DNA Mini Column back into the same collection tube. For volumes greater than 700 μl, load the column and centrifuge successively, 700 μl at a time. Each HiBind® DNA Mini Column has a total capacity of 25μg DNA. If the expected yield is larger, divide the sample into the appropriate number of columns.
7. Add 300μl of Binding Buffer (XP2) into the HiBind® DNA Mini Column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 to 60 seconds at room temperature to wash the HiBind® DNA Mini Column. Discard the flowthrough and re-use the collection tube.
8. Wash the HiBind® DNA Mini Column by adding 700μl of SPW Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol. Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 30 to 60 seconds at room temp.(NOTE: SPW Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use. See label for directions. If refrigerated, SPW Wash Buffer must be brought to room temperature before use.)
9. OPTIONAL: repeat step 8 with another 700μl of SPW Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol.(NOTE: Perform the second wash step for any salt sensitive downstream applications)
10. Discard liquid and centrifuge the empty HiBind® DNA Mini Column for 2 min at maximal speed ( ≥ 13,000xg) to dry the column matrix.
11.Do not skip this step, it is critical for the removal of ethanol from the HiBind® DNA column.
12. Place a HiBind® DNA Mini Column into a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 30-50μl (depending on desired concentration of final product) of Elution Buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) directly onto the column matrix and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuge for 1 min at maximal speed (≥13,000xg) to elute DNA. This represents approximately 70% of bound DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.(NOTE: The efficiency of eluting DNA from the HiBind® DNA Mini Column is dependent of pH. If eluting DNA with deionized water, make sure that the pH is around 8.5.)

Materials Supplied by User:
Micro-centrifuge capable of at least 10,000 x g
Sterile 1.5 ml or 2 ml Centrifuge Tubes
Sterile 10-20 ml Centrifuge Tubes
Absolute (96%-100%) Ethanol
Sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes
Centrifuge with swinging bucket rotor
1. Isolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a starter culture of 1- 5 ml LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for ~ 12-16 h at 37℃ with vigorous shaking (~ 300 rpm). Use a 10-20 ml culture tube or a flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture. It is strongly recommended that an end. A negative strain of E.coli be used for routine plasmid isolation. Examples of such strains include DH5a and JM109.
2. Pellet bacterial cells by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Decant or aspirate medium and discard.
3. Resuspend the bacterial pellet by adding 250ul of Solution I/RNase. A solution, and vorteing (or pipetting up and down). Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. Complete resuspension (no visible cell clumps) of cell pellet is vital for obtaining good yields.
4. Add 250ul of Solution II and gently mix by inverting and rotating tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2 minute incubation may be necessary. Avoid vigorous mixing as this will shear chromosomal DNA and lower plasmid purity. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 min. (Store Solution II tightly capped when not in use to avoid acidification of Solution II from CO2 in the air.)
5. Add 350ul of Solution III and mix immediately by inverting several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms. It is vital that the solution is mixed thoroughly, and immediately after the addition of Solution III to avoid localized precipitation.
6. Centrifuge at ≥13,000 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.
7. Prepare the column by adding 100ul of Equilibration Buffer placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge at≥13,000 x g for 30-60 seconds. Discard the flow through liquid.
8. Add the cleared supernatant by CAREFULLY aspirating it into a clean HiBind DNA Miniprep Column (I) assembled in a provided 2 ml collection tube. Ensure that the pellet is not disturbed and that no cellular debris has carried over into the column. Centrifuge for 1min at≥13,000 x g at room temperature to completely pass lysate through the HiBind DNA Miniprep Column (I).
9. Discard flow -through liquid. Add 500ul of Buffer HB to w ash the HiBind DNA Miniprep Column (I). Centrifuge for 30 to 60 seconds≥13,000 x g at room temperature to completely pass liquid through the HiBind DNA Miniprep Column (I).This step ensures that residual protein contaminations are removed, thus ensuring high quality DNA that will be suitable for downstream applications.
10. Discard flow -through liquid and add 700ul of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol to w ash the HiBind DNA Miniprep Column (I). Centrifuge for 30 to 60 seconds≥13,000 x g at room temperature to completely pass liquid through the HiBind Miniprep Column (I) and discard flow -through liquid. NOTE: DNA Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use. See label for directions. If refrigerated, DNA Wash Buffer must be brought to room temperature before use.
11. OPTIONAL: Repeat w ash step with another 700ul of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol.
12. Centrifuge the empty column for 2 min at≥ 13,000 x g to dry the column matrix. Do not skip this step, it is critical for good yields.
13. Place the column into a clean 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. Add 50ul to 100ul. (Depending on desired concentration of final product) of Elution Buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) or sterile deionized water directly onto the column matrix and centrifuge for 1 min at≥13,000 x g to elute DNA. An optional second elution will yield any residual DNA, though at a lower concentration.
14. Yield and quality of DNA: Determine the absorbance of an appropriate dilution of the sample at 260 nm and then at 280 nm. The DNA concentration is calculated as follows: DNA concentration = A 260 x 50 x (Dilution Factor) ug/ml. A ratio of (A 260) / (A 280) is an indication of nucleic acid purity. A value greater than 1.8 indicates > 90% nucleic acid purity. Alternatively, yield (as well as quality) can sometimes be best determined by agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis by comparison to DNA samples of known concentrations. Typically, the majority of the eluted DNA is in monomeric supercoil form, although concatamers may also be present.
PCR Product Purification
1.Place PCR production in a provided 1.5ml collection tube, add Buffer p3 five times the volume of PCR production.(Note: If the volume of PCR production is less than 100μl，add ddH2O  until the volume is 100μl)
2.Add the mixture to a Spin Column, centrifuge for 30 seconds≥8000xg at room temperature to completely pass liquid through the Spin Column, discard flow-through liquid.
3.Add 500ul of Wash Solution to wash Spin Column, centrifuge for 30 seconds≥9000 x g at room temperature to completely pass liquid through the Spin Column, discard flow -through liquid
4.Repeat step 3.
5.Place the column into a clean 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. Add 15ul to 40ul.(Depending on desired concentration of final product) of Elution Buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) or sterile deionized water directly onto the column matrix incubate at room temperature for 1 minute, centrifuge for 1 min at≥13,000xg to elute DNA.
