We decided to use iron contained ferritin as the endogenous nanoparticle.</P><P>Ferritin is composed of 12 or 24 subunits, and in coming together they form a virtually spherical and hollow shell with an internal cavity that can accommodate up to 4500 iron atoms[1]. The iron is stored in the form of ferrihydrite iron cores normally that with superparamagnetic properties [2].</P><P>Superparamagnetic nanocrystals have the ability to serve as colloidal mediators for heat generation, so it is the ideal property we want to identify in our bio-mineralized bacteria[3]. Actually, the iron contained ferritin has been reported to generate heat in response to electromagnetic signal. [4]  </P><P>Besides, ferritin is an outstanding choice because of many advantages such as instability, safety for chassis and easiness of magnetic core synthesis rather than magnetosome and metal binding peptide.</P><P>We chose FtnA, ferritin from bacteria, which composed of 24 identical subunits Ftn [1] to serve as mag-receiver. It has a suitable size of 12 nm in diameter and its central cavity is around 7.5 nm in diameter (Fig.1) [5]. We’ve built a model to predict the heat producing efficiency of ferritin FtnA.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV style="width:45%;margin:0px auto;"><DIV style="border:solid 1px #9b9898;background-color:#e2e1e1;padding:0px 7px" class="adjust-ipad-hp1"><SPAN><CENTER class="img-example">Fig.1.

However, we failed to transform the plasmids into <I>E.coli</I>, so we constructed parts to express ferritin on our own. Ferritin ftnA gene was obtained by PCR of genomic DNA using Berlin’s primers. Then, we assemble ftnA gene with PT7 and PT5, name the circuits are PT5-ftnA, PT7-ftnA respetively. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV style="width:60%;margin:0px auto;"><DIV style="border:solid 1px #9b9898;background-color:#e2e1e1;padding:0px 7px" class="adjust-ipad-hp1"><SPAN><CENTER class="img-example">Fig.3.

So we needed another more ideal method to prove that our bacteria was successfully mineralized.</P><H2>Native PAGE Test</H2><P>In most occasions, TEM test is the most assurance test, and most literature verify their in vivo mineralization by this test. However, TEM test is quite expensive, and when we doing this test, we found that it’s hard to figure more detailed structure. Consequently, we can’t verify the iron core in ferritin through TEM test. So we explored a new method to verify the iron core synthesized by ferritin after mineralization.</P><P>From literature for in vitro [8], we learned that Native PAGE is one of the most powerful techniques for studying the composition and structure of native proteins, since both the conformation and biological activity of proteins remain intact during this technique.</P><P>Two native gels will be prepared, one of them is stained by potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) to determine the mineralized ferritin, the other is regularly processed by Coomassie brilliant blue(CBB), aiming to mark the locus of ferritin as the cross-reference with the previous one.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV style="border:solid 1px #9b9898;background-color:#e2e1e1;padding:0px 7px" class="adjust-ipad-hp1"><SPAN><CENTER class="img-example">Fig.8.

Dr. Xiaowen Wang explained that it is hard to observe the heated effect of ferritin solution. This protocol would be more promising if ferritin was high-throughout prepared, concentrated and freeze-dry into powder.</P><H2>Future Work</H2><P>The circuit PT5-FtnA-RNAT has been constructed and we would try to detect the whole cell heating again.</P><P>There are some methods to detect the local heating, such as using fluorophores as molecular thermometers, the fluorescence intensity was recorded with the Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device(EMCCD). [13]</P><H2>Valuing Protein Concentration per cell</H2><P>To supply our modeling with concentration of ferritin per cell, we explored a method for valuing protein concentration per cell, and tried to make it more convenient.</P><P>After biomineralization, we take a little bacterium that resuspended by PBS, and obtain the concentration of bacterium by Hemocytometer Counting, which is marked as C1(cells/ml). The other bacterium suspension is disrupted completely. After centrifugation, the suspernatant containing ferritin is used to do SDS PAGE, and then the optical density of the protein sample is obtained by using the gel imaging analysis system, then we can calculate the concentration of the sample, which is marked as C2(μg/ml).</P><P>The protein concentration per cell is marked as C, the formula as follows.
C=C2/C1 (μg per cell) </P><P>To obtain C2, we did SDS PAGE as follows. (Note: the SDS PAGE should be repeated for several times to get more accurate data.)</P><P>Lane 1, 0.5mg/ml BSA; Lane 2-4, ferritin suspernatant; Lane 5, suspernatant of bacterium containing empty plasmid; Lane 6, 1mg/ml BSA; Lane 7, 0.25mg/ml BSA; Lane 8, 0.1mg/ml BSA.</P><P>We use bovine serum albumin (BSA) at differernt concentrations to establish the standard curve that reveals the relation of optical density and protein concentration.</P><P>Firstly we used the gel imaging analysis system to establish the standard curve and directly calculated the concentration of samples. But the error was so big, that meant the arithmetic of the software couldn’t meet us need. So we established a new standard curve by simply changing the formula. Two new standard curves calculated from two SDS-PAGE pattern are as follows:</P><DIV class="=&quot;row&quot;"><DIV style="width:60%;margin:0px auto;"><CENTER><DIV style="border:solid 1px #9b9898;background-color:#e2e1e1;padding:0px 7px"><SPAN><CENTER class="img-example">Fig.14. Two standard curves</CENTER></SPAN></DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV><P>To our surprise, the relation found from new formula doesn’t show the linearity we supposed before. Besides, we found that using gel imaging analysis system to analyze optical density has poor precision that the results have big difference between each other. We speculate it’s probably due to the grey level image processing by the system.</P><P>Unfortunately we still can’t conquer the problem that the targeted protein band is hard to measured if the band color is too deep. The stability of the results also troubled us. We decided to try Matlab to analyze our data for future work.</P><H2>References</H2><P style="font-size:13px;">[1] Arosio P, Ingrassia R, Cavadini P.
