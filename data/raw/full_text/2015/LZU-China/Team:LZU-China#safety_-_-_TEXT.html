Safety
 
Our team determined to make all aspects of the entire project perfect, especially biosafety. The one and the only organisms we used is Escherichia coli  whose lab strains that are not harmful to human at all. The main risks in our experiment are the heavy metal we used to exam our parts. To reduce that, we do many experiments in draught cupboards and we use latex gloves and masks to protect ourselves.
Our device is designed of a safer future. We design a MFC-based device. The bacteria can sense many kinds of ions and it can improve the voltage in MFC. We modify the E.coli  to make it produce riboflavin when sensed ions. Our device is designed as an enclosed systems. The measurement of the wastewater is safe, and neither the genetically modified sensor cells nor the wastewater is impossible to leak at all. Our device is designed for industrial purpose, and it is really cheap.
Our device can be very helpful in many fields. For more information, please contacted with Xiangkai Li
