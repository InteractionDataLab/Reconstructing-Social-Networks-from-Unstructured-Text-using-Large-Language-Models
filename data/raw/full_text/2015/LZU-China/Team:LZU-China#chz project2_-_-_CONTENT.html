In China, Laozi, a well-known philosopher in the Spring and Autumn Period, thought highly of water and said, 
                            ‘The best of men is like water;And Water benefits all things.And does not compete with them.AndIt dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -
                              Wherein it comes near to the Tao.’<SUP>[1]</SUP>
                              However, in our daily life, although water is noble, it is not so strong and usually gets sick. With the development of industry and modern society, water is badly polluted. So what is water pollution? Water pollution happens when toxic substances enter water bodies and degrade the quality of water. Although over 70% of the earth is covered by water, fresh water, which can be used by humans, occupied only 2.53% of the global water resources. Over 80% of rivers in China have some degree of contamination<SUP>[2]</SUP></P></DIV><H6>Some picture about water pollution reference from the Internet.</H6><P>Water pollution can be classified into organic, inorganic and so on. What we care most is heavy metal pollution because heavy metal waste water is the current outstanding problem in the field of water pollution and becomes the focus of research in the controlling field.
                          </P><P>Heavy metals from industrial processes can accumulate in nearby water body, which are toxic to marine life such as fish and shellfish, and subsequently to the humans who eat them. Heavy metals can slow development, result in birth defects and some are carcinogenic. The most commonly encountered toxic heavy metals in wastewater include Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, and the less common include Chromium, Copper, Nickel, Zinc<SUP>[3]</SUP>. Three kinds of heavy metals are of concern, including toxic metals (such as Hg, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, As, Co, Sn, etc.), precious metals (such as Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, Ru etc.) and radionuclides (such as U, Th, Ra, Am, etc.)<SUP>[4]</SUP>. Heavy metals bring about serious environmental pollution, threatening human health and ecosystem.<SUP>[5]</SUP></P><P>here are millions people are struggling with water pollution. In China, for example, about 75 percent of the population (or 1.1 billion people) are without access to unpolluted drinking water, according to standards from China<SUP>[6]</SUP>. And our university, Lanzhou University, located on northwestern China, where lacking water especially. What’s worse, water pollution is also serious including heavy metal contaminants.
                          </P><H5 class="left-align">MFC</H5><P>Instead of exploiting more water resources, which has more and more negative influence[1], it’s better to make less pollution and treat water pollution.[2] And we must know what kinds of contaminations in the water and how much are them. So we chose MFC (Microbial Fuel Cells) to detect the heavy metal in water.
                          </P><P>So, what is MFC?</P><P>Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide new opportunities for the sustainable production of energy from biodegradable, reduced compounds. MFCs function on different carbohydrates but also on complex substrates present in wastewaters，which is an ideal approach to solve both pollution problem and energy crisis. Compared with traditional chemical methods of sewage treatment, MFC is environmental friendly and widely adept by various condition<SUP>[3]</SUP>.</P><P>A MFC converts biomass energy directly into electricity. This can be achieved when bacteria switch from the natural electron acceptor, such as oxygen or nitrate, to an insoluble acceptor, such as the MFC anode. A typical microbial fuel cell consists of two compartments: anode and cathode compartments separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM). In the anode compartment, microorganisms oxidize the fuel and generating CO<SUB>2</SUB>, electrons and protons. Electrons are transferred through an external electric circuit to the cathode compartment, while protons are transferred to the cathode compartment through the membrane. Electrons and protons are consumed in the cathode compartment, combining with oxygen to form water.</P><DIV class="col s12"><H6>Figure 1. The working principle of a microbial fuel cell.

Riboflavin has two active coenzyme forms, riboflavin 5'-phosphate (R5P; flavin mononucleotide [FMN]) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)<SUP>[9]</SUP>, which can both transfer electron. </P><H6>Fig 1 Riboflavin: C17H20N4O6. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin</H6><P>
                          As riboflavin’s structure shows, there is a transfer of two electrons from hydrogen and hydrid ions, so riboflavin can be regarded as a electron shuttle and even a kind of redox mediator. Though riboflavin is very important in mediator-driven bioelectricity generation, the detailed mechanism on electron transfer has not been precisely investigated yet<SUP>[10]</SUP>.</P><P>
                          Researchers find that increase of riboflavin biosynthesis can profounfly enhance extracellular electron transfer in bacteria and then improve the efficience of MFC. For example, the increase of riboflavin biosynthesis by Shewanella at the alkaline condition underlies the improvement of the electricity output in MFCs(Fig 2)<SUP>[11]</SUP>.</P></DIV><H6>
                            Fig 2  Increased riboflavin synthesis underlies enhanced electron transfer in Shewanella. We draw the conclusion that increased riboflavin synthesis can improve the MFC’s production.</H6><P>
                        So riboflavin became our star. Since it can be expressed in bacteria, we can combine riboflavin and MFC to improve the electricity output of MFC. And it is easy and mature to measure the concentration of rirboflavin in aqueous solution based on the technique of OD (optical density). The peaks of absorbance occur at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm(Fig 3)<SUP>[12]</SUP>. P. Drossler etc. investigated a wide range of pH values from pH -1.1 to pH  13.4 and made the absorption spectrum curve over different pH value(Fig 4)<SUP>[13]</SUP></P><H6>
                            Fig 3 Absorption spectrum of riboflavin in aqweous solution. And the peaks of absorbance occur around at 223, 266, 373 and 445 nm</H6><H6>Fig 4 Absorption cross-section spectra of riboflavin in aqueous solutions at various values of pH. The riboflavin concentration used in the measurements was around 10-4 mol dm<SUP>3</SUP></H6><P> In our laboratory, we used the multi-spectral scanner to analyse the optimal absorption wavelength and finally found absorption peak at 444nm is the optimum in pH 1.17. And our optimal absorption wavelength corresponds with previous researches. In order to make pH 1.17, we mixed 2ml 0.1mol/L HCl with 1ml riboflavin aqueous solutions extract from engineering bacteria. Then it is able to detect the concentration of rirboflavin by OD value.</P><P>There are many methods to get riboflavin by microorganism. In E.coli, a gene cluster, consisting of RibA, RibB, RibDG, RibH and RibE and separating to different transcription units, regulates the synthesis of riboflavin. The details of riboflavin biosynthesis have been figured out(Fig 5)<SUP>[14]</SUP>.</P>

Based on synthesis biology, our team creates a smart system called Micro Holmes which can monitor the pollutant inside the water in real time. Once the system was founded, through users’ laptops, smartphones or some other media, we would acquire the statistics of pollutant which has been analyzed by the system. Reforming the E.Coli, we endowed them with the ability of sensing the pollutant inside the water and delivering the message of it. Therefore, raising them inside the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), they can rapidly augment the voltage as soon as the polluted occurred. Then, by the automatically collecting and analyzing equipment, we can know the concentration of pollutant converted by the instant electric signal. Escherichia coli, a tiny but full of power creature, perfectly plays an important part as Holmes in our project. So, are you interest in how he was created and how he works?</P><P>First of all，Mr. Holmes must has a piercing eye to find the trail of pollutant; And after detecting pollutant, Mr. Holmes must has the ability to convey the message to us in time. Therefore, in order to constitute a series of inductivity parts—which can be efficiently expressed in E.Coli BL 21 bacterial strains—we link the efficient receptor of heavy metal ions with RibB--- the key synthesis gene of riboflavin. They can translate the information from the concentration of heavy metal ions to the riboflavin content, which is the product of reporter gene RibB. Riboflavin is a kind of redox mediator who works as a highly-efficient electronic transfer mediator. When the concentration of Riboflavin increased, it can improve the efficiency of electronic translocation between E.Coli and the anode and eventually augment the voltage. Combined with MFC (microbial fuel cell) system, we can measure the concentration of heavy metal ions in water through the voltage presented by MFC system and realize the conversion of heavy metal ions concentration to electrical signal. This method has lots of advantages, such as compatibility, high efficiency, instantaneity, reliability and so on.</P><P>The main idea of designing this experiment can be seen in the following flow chart.</P></DIV><H6>Fig 1 Whole Experiment Flow Chart </H6><P>In this project, parts were divided into two kinds. One is constitutive part, combined by various type of promoter, RBS, RibB and terminator. We constructed the constitutive parts to select a highly-expressed part of RibB. The other is inducible part with RBS, RibB terminator and promoter which can sense heavy metal ions. This kind of parts can highly express RibB so that it is practical to associate the concentration of heavy metal ions with the output of riboflavin. Therefore, putting the E.Coli BL 21 into the MFC, we collected the statistics of MFC on the condition that concentration of metal ion solution was already known. So we built the correlation model, then induced the E.Coli BL21 with the solution to be measured. It is easy to figure out the concentration by measuring the voltage of MFC. We can monitor the specific metal ions real-timely, quantitatively and swiftly through this way and more importantly, it has compatibility in the measurement of metal ion by changing the parts to detect different metal ions.</P><H4> </H4><H5 class="left-align">An efficient riboflavin synthesis gene: <EM>RibB</EM></H5><H6 class="left-align">1 An Introduction of <EM>RibB</EM></H6><H6 class="left-align">1.1 The biosynthesis of riboflavin inside <EM>E.coli</EM></H6><P><A href="#" title="23333">Riboflavin</A>, also <A href="#" id="ref1" onmouseover="over()" onmouseout="out()"> called</A> vitamin B2, can be synthesized by various kinds of plants and animals. The basic synthesis principal is similar, that one molecular of GTP and two molecular of ribulose 5-phosphate undergo a series of enzymatic reaction[1]. However, the operons vary from bacteria to bacteria. At present, we have made the principal clear in most kind of bacterium and in this project, we chose E.coli in which the riboflavin synthetic genes emerge as nonlinear gene cluster and was distributed into nonhomologous chromosome.</P><P>Fig 2-A shows the process of riboflavin synthesis and its relevant genes including RibA (coding GTP cyclohydrolase II), RibB (coding 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase), RibDG (coding a kind of bifunctional riboflavin specificdeaminase/reductase), RibH (coding lumazine synthase) and RibE (coding riboflavin synthase).

Besides, those genes are not focus on a same operon. According to some research, RibB is of vital importance to the synthesis of riboflavin which in charge of coding DHBP synthetase and can catalyze the synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate[3]. Researches conducted by Danielle Pedrolli and other researchers show that the FMN riboswitch, which is in the untranslated region of 5’ terminal of RibB, can regulate the expression of RibB so that it can inhibit the biosynthesis of riboflavin. Thus, the enzyme translated by RibB becomes a limiter of riboflavin synthesis. Therefore, we can evidently improve the output of riboflavin by knocking out the FMN riboswitch or overexpressing RibB. Related experiment statistics can be referred from Fig 3. Compared with the whole riboflavin synthesis genes cluster, RibB has the advantages of convenience, high efficiency and short sequence as it is only 654bp. Consequently, our team choosed RibB as a report gene to construct parts and then builded the connection between heavy metal ions and RibB and finally used the product of RibB—riboflavin to impact the voltage of MFC so that we realized the monitoring of heavy metal ions automatically, quantitatively and efficiently.

Genetic organization of the mar regulon in E.coli shows as Fig 2a. There are two promoter sites on the marO operator, and both of them can be bound by a kind of regulatory protein called MarR, which is coded by MarR and can repress the expression of marO(Fig 2b and Fig 2c)<SUP>[2]</SUP>. MarR is a very special and vital transcription factor, which can bound to either of marO’s two promoter sites rs1 and rs2(rs means repressor binding site). And MarR repressor is homodimer. And it can form tetramer once there is copper for its special structure(Fig 3). Copper(II) oxidizes a cysteine residue (Cys80) on MarR to generate disulfide bonds between two MarR dimers, thereby inducing tetramer formation and the dissociation of MarR from its cognate promoter DNA, two sites of marO(Fig 4)<SUP>[1]</SUP>. Some experiments firmed the explanation(Fig 5)<SUP>[1]</SUP>.</P><P>So we chose promoter marO as the copper sensor. Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> can oxidize Cys80 and make MarR apart from marO to derepress the MarR dimer. Than the promoter marO will start the following genes’ transcription. In our part BBa_K1755301, the report gene is riboflavin. So we associated the copper concentration with the output of riboflavin.</P><P>During our experiments, it is a big surprise for us to find that the marO is able to respond to Cr6+ as well though it is not so strong as Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>.</P><DIV class="col s12"><H6>

When there is no Hg2+, it cannot start the transcription. Upon binding the cognate metal ions, the metallated MerR homodimer causes a realignment of the promoter so that RNA polymerase contacts the -35 and -10 sequences leading to open complex formation and transcription.(see more details http://  parts.igem.org /Part:BBa_K346002).</P><P> So PmerT promoter can be induced by Hg2+ and start the coding of ribB downstream to increase the output of riboflavin. And there is some quantity relationship about the concentration of Hg2+ and the production of riboflavin. We can calculate the the concentration of Hg2+ by our “Micro Holmes” system.</P><P>2.1.3 Results</P><P>We transformed BBa_K1755305 into E.coli BL-21.

It is a positive regulator so F- can induce the promoter to transcript. Since the report gene is at the downstream of fluoride promoter, the riboflavin production can be influenced by the change of F- concentration.

It targets specially the fast growing demands from the open source community. pcDuino3 provides easy-to-use tool chains and is compatible with the popular Arduino ecosystem such as Arduino Shields.</P><P>Features &amp; Highlights:</P><UL><LI>• 100% compatible with original Arduino Shields</LI><LI>• 100% compatible with Linux and Android</LI><LI>• Further support for:</LI><LI>• C, C ++ with GNU tool</LI><LI>• Java with standard Android SDK Python</LI><LI>• Arduino pin header, Aduino UNO Slots: 14x GPIO, 2x PW M, 6x ADC, 1x UART, 1xSPI, 1x I2C</LI><LI>• Ethernet 10M/100Mbps, WiFi, SATA</LI></UL><P>This board has very sufficient GPIO pins, it can make everything you think out, so we take it.</P><P>And the next is the another important device, named voltage magnification, since the voltage from microorganism reaction is very low, so if we want to read the value precise, before reading this value, we must amplify it, and then connect it to my MCU’s simulation pins, and by the helping of A-D chip, we can make this simulate value to digital value, then, the MCU can process this value, what out’s doing is display this value to screen—this screen is a touchable screen, so the input to the MCU, we can make a software to access.</P><P>the connection of screen and pcduino</P><H5>Software Overview</H5><P>We design this software to read and process the voltage value.
                        The design tool kit includes three part, the first is demo, since some all knows reasons, we cannot take microorganism outside, so, we have to make a module named demo, from the demo part, you can know, how this hardware and software work. The second module is analysis part, the hardware real working, reading the voltage value from the microorganism reaction, and processed by the formula—we get this formula also by this MCU process—and then get the value of density of oil plants. The third part is pre-calculation part, this part</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="parts" class="section scrollspy row"><DIV id="popout" class="col s12"><H4 class="left-align">Part</H4><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5><H5 class="left-align">Part list</H5></DIV></DIV><DIV id="interlab" class="section scrollspy row"><DIV id="popout" class="col s12"><H4 class="left-align">Interlab</H4><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5></DIV></DIV><DIV id="future" class="section scrollspy row"><DIV id="popout" class="col s12"><H4 class="left-align">Future</H4><H5 class="left-align">to be finished</H5></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col hide-on-small-only m3 l3"><DIV class="pinnedx inorder"><UL class="sidelist section table-of-contents"><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#background">Background</A></H5></LI><LI class="sidelist">Water pollution</LI><LI class="sidelist">MFC</LI><LI class="sidelist">Riboflavin</LI></UL><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#wetlab">Wet Lab</A></H5></LI><LI class="sidelist">Introduction</LI><LI class="sidelist">Aefficient riboflavin synthesis gene:RibB</LI><LI class="sidelist">Pollutant sensor</LI><LI class="sidelist">Our MFC</LI><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#drylab">Dry Lab</A></H5></LI><LI class="sidelist">Micro Holmes</LI><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#parts">Parts</A></H5></LI><LI class="sidelist">Part list</LI><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#interlab">Interlab</A></H5></LI><LI class="sidelist"><H5><A href="#future">Future</A></H5></LI></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="page-footer teal"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col l6 s12"><H5 class="white-text">LZU-China 2015</H5><P class="grey-text text-lighten-4">222, TianShui South Road, Lanzhou, China, 730000</P><H6 class="white-text">Copyright 2015 Lanzhou University</H6></DIV><DIV class="col l3 s12"><H5 class="white-text">Acknowledgments</H5><UL><LI><A class="white-text" href="http://en.lzu.edu.cn/">Educational Administration Office, LZU</A></LI><LI><A class="white-text" href="http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/en/">Cuiying Honors College, LZU</A></LI><LI><A class="white-text" href="http://lifesc.lzu.edu.cn/">School of life, LZU</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-copyright"><DIV class="container">
