The protein RibB catalyzes the conversion of D-ribulose 5-phosphate to formate and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. This protein is involved in one step of the subpathway that synthesizes 2-hydroxy-3-oxobutyl phosphate from D-ribulose 5-phosphate. Proteins known to be involved in this subpathway in this organism are 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (ribB). This subpathway is part of the pathway riboflavin biosynthesis, which is itself part of cofactor biosynthesis.
