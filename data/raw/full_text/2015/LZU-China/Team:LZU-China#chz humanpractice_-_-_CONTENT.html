Then after recycling enough data, we compared and analyzed the consequence of questionnaires and the statistics we collected.</P><DIV class="col s12"><DIV class="col s12 m8 l 8"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="card-content"><P>This is a map we painted based on the statistics of the questionnaires. The dark green spot on the map represent those places in which people think have suffered a heavy metal pollution.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>It is obviously that, from the public perspective, severe heavy metal pollution usually occurs in industrial area and the comparable prosperous cities in the developing countries. Without doubting, that’s very easy to understand that they sacrifice the environment to get the economic growth.</P><P>Most of the countries, when it comes to its growth from ‘developing’ to ‘developed’, with the multifactor of its population growth, industry accumulating, imperfect technique and the climate and geography of its own, it does have more and severe heavy metal pollution.</P><DIV class="col s12"><DIV class="col s12 m8 l 8"><DIV class="card"><DIV class="card-content"><P>This is a river basin of China and the spot is based on Chinese questionnaires.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>According to the Chinese residence, whatever the pollutant is, pollution seems always concentrate at the middle and downstream. And at the same time, the industrial center of China is at the downstream of Yangtze River and Yellow River so these places become the harder-hit area of heavy metal pollution.</P><P>However, take Yangtze River as an example, there are several polluted area in the upstream which are the same severe situation as the downstream.</P><P>The data of this graph comes from our Chinese questionnaire as well. The reports from different medium recent years might contribute to the variation of the data, because the reports about mercury and chromium contaminants were in the majority, which corresponds with our graph. But when it comes to how serious it is about the heavy metal water pollution in China.</P><P>Excepting those data that can be used in the map, other statistic results about some questions seem to reflect the different attitude to water quality between Chinese and western people.</P><H6><P><STRONG>Q1: Is there any water heavy metals contamination on local?</STRONG></P></H6><P>A. No                           14.81%；63.64%</P><P>B. Yes, but not very serious          65.43%；27.27%</P><P>C. Yes, very bad                   19.75%；9.09%</P><P>Compared with the European who thought they live with clean water, most of Chinese considered their life have suffered from heavy metal pollution more or less.</P><H6><P><STRONG>Q2: Do you concentrate about the water contamination?</STRONG></P></H6><P>A.

Chemical detection              90.12%；60.00%</P><P>B. Biological detection              56.79%；70.00%</P><P>C. Physical detection               41.98%；50.00%</P><P>Physical detection methods of heavy metal pollution in water bodies are clearly less than the other two kinds of detection methods, such as biological or chemical. In chemical and biological detection of these two types of methods, Chinese people are aware of the basic chemical method, while European is more biased in favor of biological detection method, but their understanding of chemical detection method is not much lower than the biological detection method.</P><H6><P><STRONG>Q6: Do you think the present approaches that detect heavy metals are complicated?</STRONG></P></H6><P>A. Yes                          75.31%；46.15%</P><P>B.

European think the testing method is more realistic, after all, if want to have an accurate judgment towards the quality of the water situation, time and material costs are indispensable.</P><H6><P><STRONG>Q8: How do you think the genetically modified microbes using for restoring water heavy metals contamination?</STRONG></P></H6><P>A. Very promising, and know of it                 32.1%；18.18%</P><P>B. Very promising, but don’t know about it         46.91%；45.45%</P><P>C. Have no idea                               20.99%；36.36%</P><P>Data from the simple shows that people around the world have a good impression of biological testing method, but the majority don’t know too much about this detection method. To raise public concentration of biological water quality testing, we need more public propaganda.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col s0 m2 l2"> </DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="page-footer teal"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col l6 s12"><H5 class="white-text">LZU-China 2015</H5><P class="grey-text text-lighten-4">222, TianShui South Road, Lanzhou, China, 730000</P><H6 class="white-text">Copyright 2015 Lanzhou University</H6></DIV><DIV class="col l3 s12"><H5 class="white-text">Sponsors</H5><UL><LI><A class="white-text" href="#!">Link 1</A></LI><LI><A class="white-text" href="#!">Link 2</A></LI><LI><A class="white-text" href="#!">Link 3</A></LI><LI><A class="white-text" href="#!">Link 4</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-copyright"><DIV class="container">
