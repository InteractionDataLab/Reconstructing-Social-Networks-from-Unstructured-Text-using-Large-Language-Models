Plasmid Extraction
We used OMEGATM Plasmid Mini Prep Kit (D6943-02) to extracted plasmids.
1. Add 2mL bacteria liquid into a 2mL centrifuge tube;
2. Centrifuge the bacteria liquid at 12000r/min for 2 minutes;
3. Discard the upper clear liquid;
4. Add 250μL Solution I into the centrifuge tube. Vortex the tube until there is no solid
sediment left in the bottom;
5. Add 250μL Solution II into the centrifuge tube. Rotate the tube slightly until the liquid
being clear;
6. Add 350μL Solution III into the centrifuge tube. Rotate the tube several times until white
sediment appearing;
7. Centrifuge at 12000r/min for 20 minutes;
8. Transfer the upper liquid into a spin column with a collection tube, and centrifuge them at
10000r/min for 1 minute;
9. Discard the filtered liquid in the collection tube, then add 500μL HB Buffer into the spin
column. Centrifuge them at 10000r/min for 1 minute;
10. Discard the filtered liquid in the collection tube, then add 700μL DNA Wash Buffer into
the spin column. Centrifuge them at 10000r/min for 1 minute;
11. Perform step 10 again.
12. Discard the collection tube. Put the spin column standing for 1 or 2 minutes.
13. Transfer the spin column into a clean centrifuge tube. Add 30-50μL Elution Buffer which
has been preheated to 65℃, then centrifuge them at 10000r/min for 1 minute.
14. Take the liquid back to the spin column and centrifuge them for one more time.
15. Store the liquid which is the plasmid solution under -20℃.

Parts Examination
         Enzymatic activity testing
         1. Add 2-3mL blank medium into a clean cuvette.
         2. Add 2-3mL bacteria liquid into another clean cuvette.
         3. Take blank medium as the blank, examine the concentration of bacteria at 600nm in a VIS-Spectrophotometer.
         4. Add 2-3mL bacteria liquid into a centrifuge tube, then centrifuge it at 12000r/min for 3 minutes.
         5. Add 1mL upper liquid into a clean cuvette, then add 2mL more 0.1M HCl into it. Rotate the mixed liquid for several times to make sure it is well mixing.
         6. Take blank medium as the blank, examine the concentration of riboflavin at 444nm in a VIS-Spectrophotometer.
Running Device
         MFC assembly
         1. Treatment of carbon fiber felt
         The carbon fiber felt was first cleaned by deionized water，and was then boiled with 1mol/L NaOH and 1mol/L HCl each for 30 minutes. After each boiling,it was cleaned by deionized water until its pH value is 7. Finaly it was dried at 105。C for 20 minutes.
         2. Treatment of proton exchange membrane
         The proton exchange membrane was boiled in turn in 30% H2O2, deionized water, 0.5mol/L H2SO4 and deionized water for 30 minutes.
         3. Sterilization
         250ml graduated cylinders,2 250ml conical flasks,12 50ml centrifuge tubes,cathode chamber and anode chamber(with magnon),sterile water,gaskets and carbon fiber felt(fixed on titanium wire)
         4. Combination of cathode chamber and anode chamber
         A proton exchange membrane was put between the anode and the cathode,fixed with gaskets and parafilm.Check for leaks with sterile water.
         5. Treatment of bacteria solution
         Bacteria was cleaned with M9 medium, and the absorbance (OD values ) was measured in the 600nm wavelength and were adjusted to the 1.3--1.4.
         6. Add liquids to cathode chamber and anode chamber
                  6.1anode chamber:
                  24ml bacteria solution after treatment,216ml M9 medium,appropriate amount 20mg/ml CuSO4 mother solution (make sure the final concentration of Cu2+ are 0、1、2、3、4mg/L)
                  6.2cathode chamber:
                  240ml PBS（with 100mmol/L K3[Fe(CN)6]）
         7. Fixed carbon fiber felt
         Carbon fiber felt was put in front of the carbon fiber felt,and the titanium wire tied to it was fixed on the bottle cap of cathode chamber and anode chamber.
         MFC operation
         1. The MFC was put on the magnetic disk, the temperature and the speed of magnon were set, the temperature sensors were put into liquids.
         2. Voltage was recorded every other minute.Find the relationship between peak voltage and the concentration of Cu2+.
FCM
Methods
1. We extracted the plasmid by the OMEGATM Plasmid Mini Prep Kit (D6943-02).
2. BBa_I13504 was cut by XbaI and PstI. J23101, J23106 and J23117 were cut by SpeI and PstI. The I13504 was inserted into the 3 vectors above by T4 Ligase. Finally the devices we constructed were transformed into E.coli DH5α.
Cultivation
3. The cultivation of our bacteria was performed in test tubes (16cm long, diameter is 3cm) filled with 5ml LB medium. The incubator was kept at 37°C and 260 rpm shaking frequency.
4. Chloramphenicol was added to each media. Chloramphenicol was added from a 1000X stock stored at -20°C for a final concentration of 25 µg/ml.
Measurement
5. Cells were washed by PBS twice in order to clean the medium.
6. Measurement was experimented via LSRFortessa, the channel was 488nm/510nm.
7. The data was exported by FCSDiva as .fcs files. If one cell's FITC value is higher than 103, we believe that the cell is colored. We calculated the ratio of colored cells in total cells. The ratio*100 was set as the unit of the device's strength.
