Rong Xu
born in July 1987, is a doctor candidate studying in Lanzhou University. She is an expert of heavy metal reduction and cellulose degradation using gene modified bacteria and she does enjoy her researches. Moreover, she helps us with her enthusiasm overcome many kinds of problems about our project. So we believe that she is one of the best advisors in our team-LZU CHINA to attend this competition.

Xuejing Du
Xuejing Du is one of the student leader of group members in our project. His interest is microbiology and behavioural sciences. It is he who has recruited the key members of this team and has brought a new concept to MFCs. He not only wrote over the 80% of the paperwork but also has done 90% of the artwork for wiki, poster and uniform. Human practice, which we thought a tough, sophisticated burden, was carried by him. In addition, he has designed a questionnaire and made a survey about people's attitude towards sewage treatment and the use of microbial fuel cells in China and UK.His creative ideas help us vastly. Now, he is preparing for the presentation in order to help our team to attend Giant Jamboree in October.

Zhengdong Zhang
Amongst all the members struggling for our project, I rank as those busiest guys. My name is Zhengdong Zhang, working like a dog, dressed as a dull nerd. Not am I clever, but the reason why I had been busy was just I have few hobby. Like many of our team, biology science is my only lover.

Feifan Xu
My name is Feifan Xu, a junior student. It is my great honor to become part of iGEM LZU-China 2015. To be honest, I am a diffident guy more or less. So work like electrophoresis PCR or other molecule experiment are quite suitable for me. My primary job is parts construction. Besides that, the measurement of part expression quantity and a little MFC work is also my duty. I like swim in my free time. I love computer games too. After the experiment of the passing year, I find out a truth. The only failure is give up, if you keep fighting, hope is coming.

Fei Deng
Fei Deng majors in biology and he seems like a serious guy. Indeed, He is strict with lots of things, such as the operations of our experiments. But he is an easygoing man in daily life. He likes a lots of activities including playing football, reading books. While he said that he cannot tell us what he loves most. In this program, he constructed some parts such as part K1755003 and examined some parts to verify that they can really work. Besides, he wrote some text for our wiki.

Tianyi Shao
Hello,I am Tianyi Shao majoring in Chemistry from Lanzhou University.I don’t mean to exaggerate how splendidly our project performs in that Micro-Holmes as a pollutant detector is pragmatic and useful in every corner of this contaminated world.Three other partners and I are primarily in charge of the construction and operation of the MFCs,and collecting the data for an experienced formula that has widely applicability.I went to Japan for communication with top Japanese iGEM’s undergraduates in this summer and we all enjoyed this kind of opportunities to share our precious ideas.I am looking forward to having a brainstorm with you coming from all over the world in Boston.

I’m Ningning Yao, major in biology from Lanzhou University Cuiying Honors College. It’s my great honor to take part in iGEM as I am enthusiasm in life science. In the past half year, I made porin, constructed k1755003, joined the communication with some universities in Japan and accomplished the previous work of interlab. I also borrowed some experimental material from Jilin University, Nanjing University and Huazhong Agricultural University. Thanks to iGEM, this half year of experience made me feel fulfillment although my work isn’t too much. Wish LZU-2015 can get a good achievement.

I’m Ning Chai, a girl loves nature and is keen on plants. During the time after joining in iGEM, I spared every free time in lab. However, when I have some break time in the lab, I often listen to the pop music or read some English magazine. By the way, Durarara was watched after setting the PCR of RibB in the break time. Now, you must know some of me.

The School of Life Sciences at Lanzhou University has a long history. It originated as the Department of Botany and the Department of Zoology of National Lanzhou University, which were founded in 1946 as the first departments of life sciences in western China. After several generations' efforts in over sixty years, the School of Life Science is in a good development trend in many aspects, such as faculty and staff, discipline construction, teaching and researching, and local service. Basing its scientific research on the cold and arid environment in western China, the faculty has made great achievements. The School of Life Sciences is active in international collaboration in order to create an open and supportive academic atmosphere, extend academic horizons, and improve the faculty and students' ability in research and creativity.
Cuiying Honors College
Cuiying Honors College (CHC) was founded in August 2010 within Lanzhou University as part of China's Top-Notch Undergraduate Training Program. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance are investing in this new pilot scheme in order to develop future leaders with exceptional talent in the core disciplines. Every year this program only admits the best 1000 students from the 6 million new undergraduates nationwide. Lanzhou University has been selected as one of 19 institutions implementing this national program.
