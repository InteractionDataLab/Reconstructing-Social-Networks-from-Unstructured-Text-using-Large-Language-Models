Project
This is what We do
background
Our IGEM research project involves study of the autophagy phenomenon by using the GFP to reveal it more clearly. The Autophagy is a biological process which acts like a recycle factory. Like you put a pop can into the trash bin and then reproduce by the factory, the procedure of autophagy just catch the aging, denaturing, damaged organelles and send them into the lysosome which degrades the organelles.
Health
Autophagy is developed as a way to address the disease and maintain the health of human body. With the degradation of the denaturing cellular, our cells can have the ability to defend themselves without other medical treatment.
Anti-aging
Autophagy is also capable to keep us young and strong. It is better than the cosmetic we used which may cause other problem.
Fight with cancer.
Autophagy gets the potential impact to fight with cancer. However it still get some negative effect. The reaction taken place in the lysosome can consciously can unconsciously help the cancer cell to grow. It may be an efficient assist of deteriorating the denaturation of tumor cell. After all, it still play a paramount significance in the future genetic study.
Human Practice
How We do it
Environmental Impact
Since our subject is a fundamental work in this field, all the processes were finished in the laboratory. It did not bring any negative effects to our environment.
Safety
The experiment itself is totally safe. Although we met some trouble during the operation of experiment, fortunately, all the troubles did not cause any hurt to teammates or others.
Education
In order to make the public have deeper comprehending of genetic modification, we did a lecture and a questionnaire of people about GM food. The reason why we used the GM food as the topic but not the subject of our experiment was that our subject is too professional for normal people to understand.
Evaluation
We summarized and processed our statistics. It is not surprised that the students accept GM food in a much larger extent than that in general public.
