Protocols
Yeast Transformation
Written up by Bowman Clark
Purpose
This is a protocol for the transformation of plasmids into yeast.
Materials
Yeast culture
1.5 mL sterile tube
Pipette
One-Step buffer
10 microliters DTT - 1g - $42.90 Sigma Aldrich
5 microliters ssDNA - 1mg - $32 Sigma Aldrich
3 microliters plasmid
Sterile water
One-Step buffer - adding 80 microliters of (Possibly divide by factor of 10)
2.06g LiAc - 250 g = $51.50
40g PEG
Make 80 mL solution in water
Equipment
8000 rpm microcentrifuge – 134
42°C incubator - Water Bath B025
vortex – 134
Protocol
Start a 5 mL yeast culture and grow overnight
Take 500 μl of overnight culture and place in 1.5 mL sterile tube. Label tube with strain   name and plasmid name
Spin in microcentrifuge for 30 sec at 8K rpm to pellet cells
Remove and discard supernatant
Resuspend pellet in 1 mL sterile water by gently pipetting up and down
Pellet the cells and centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 30 sec again
Remove and discard supernatant
Heat ssDNA at 90-100°C for 5 min
Add 80 μl One-Step buffer (vortex after each addition), 1 μl of 1M DTT, 5 μl of ssDNA,   and 5 μl of plasmid. Mix well
Incubate at 42°C for 30-60 min
Add 1 mL sterile water to transformation, mix and spin at 8000 rpm for 30 seconds
Remove 800 μl liquid from tube and resuspend transformed cells in residual liquid
Plate on selective media
Parafilm plates and allow to grow for 2-4 days
Discussion
Add more plasmid if transformations are not working
Make a new 1-step buffer for every transformation - DO NOT USE AN OLD STOCK

Paragraph form
Inoculate 5 mL of yeast broth and grow the culture up overnight. Pipette 500 μL of the   culture into a sterilized 1.5 mL tube. Label the tube. Centrifuge the tube for 30 seconds at 8000   rpm to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant. Add 1mL of sterile water to the tube and   resuspend the cells by gently pipetting up and down. Centrifuge the tube again for 30 seconds   at 8000 rpm to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant. Add the following and vortex after each   addition: 80 μL One-step buffer, 10 μL of 1 M DTT, 5 μL of ssDNA, and 3 μL of plasmid. Mix   well. Incubate the tube at 42 degrees C for 30 minutes. Add 1 mL of sterile water to the   transformation and mix. Centrifuge again at 8000 rpm for 30 seconds. Remove and discard 800   μL of liquid from the tube, and resuspend the cells in the remaining liquid. Plate on selective   media.

iGEM Protocol: http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Ligation
Protocol Paragraph Form:
First, add the appropriate amount of vector, insert and water to PCR tubes for desired ligation   ratios. Next, heat the tubes in a water bath at 42 C to free up the sticky ends. Pipette the T4 Ligase   Buffer and add 1.5 ul toT4 each tube. Then pipette the T4 Ligase up and down and add 1 ul to each   tube pipetting the mixture up and down after addition. Finally incubate the tubes at 16 C for 16   hours in the thermocycler.
Restriction Digest Protocol
Written up by Bowman Clark (Adjusted by Lexi Petrucciani)
Purpose
To prepare parts for assembly
Materials
Ice and bucket/container
Eppendorf Tubes
Part A (Purified DNA, > 16ng/ul)
Part B (Purified DNA, > 16ng/ul)
Linearized plasmid backbone (25ng/ul)
dH2O
NEB Buffer 2
BSA
Restriction Enzymes: EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI, DpnI
Thermal cycler or Thermomixer
Equipment
List all the equipment needed to complete this protocol, including what lab # in Bindley or   another building it can be found in
Protocol
Keep all enzymes and buffers used on ice.
Thaw NEB Buffer 2 and BSA in room temperature water. Mix by shaking the   tubes, and flick/spin them to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.
Add 500ng of DNA to the appropriately labelled tube. Add distilled water to   the tubes for a total volume of 36.5ul in each tube.
Calculation example (with 25ng/ul as DNA sample concentration):
500ng ÷ 25ng/ul = 20ul of DNA sample
36.5ul (total volume) – 20ul (DNA sample) = 16.5ul of distilled water
Pipet 5ul of NEB Buffer 2 to each tube.
Pipet 0.5ul of BSA to each tube.
Add 4uL of the appropriate enzymes
For 3A:
Part 1: EcoRI and SpeI
Part 2: XbaI and PstI
Backbone: EcoRI and PstI(IF NOT ALREADY LINEARIZED)
For Standard:
Insert: EcoRI and SpeI
Vector: EcoRI and XbaI
The total volume in each tube should be 50ul. Mix well by vortexing. Spin the   samples briefly to collect all of the mixture to the bottom of the tube.
Incubate the restriction digests at 37°C for 4 hours, then use immediately or   store at -20C.
