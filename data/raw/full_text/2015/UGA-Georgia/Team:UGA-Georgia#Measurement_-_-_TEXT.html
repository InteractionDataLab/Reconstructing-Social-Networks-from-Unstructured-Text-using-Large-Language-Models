Caption: ESD (Extreme Studentized Deviate) test to identify individual outlier data obtained for each mutant colony. The top row represents 10 mutant colonies, while each column represents triplicate mCherry fluorescence measurements from each team for the corresponding colony. Fluorescence values were standardized into percentage values relative to colony M3C1, by making the average fluorescence values for this colony 1 or 100%. Both significant and possible outliers were removed in subsequent analysis. N.A., not available.
Caption for upper table: Correlation matrix of mCherry fluorescence data across 7 participating iGEM teams after removing individual outlier data (see below for the ESD test table). Compared to the upper table, most of the R2 values had been improved, indicating the outlier data did negatively affect the whole dataset.
Caption for lower table: : Correlation matrix of mCherry fluorescence data across 9 participating iGEM teams enabling identification of outlier data on the team level. The correlation between each pair of teams was assessed by plotting their respective fluorescence dataset against one another via a linear model, where a R2 value was calculated to reflect how well the correlation was. As shown in the highlighted orange cells, datasets acquired by the two teams were systematically deviated from datasets obtained by all other teams. Therefore, the datasets from those two teams were removed in subsequent analysis.
