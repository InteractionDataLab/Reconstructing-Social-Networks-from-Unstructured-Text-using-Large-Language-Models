We have learned much about the field of synthetic biology and have grown significantly as scientists in our attempt to expand the use of Archaea in the field of Synthetic Biology. This would not have been possible without the contributions of the many people and organizations listed below.</FONT></P><H2><B> Special Thanks to:</B></H2><P><FONT size="3">The first group that we must thank is the University of Georgia Microbiology Department. They have allowed us to use their equipment and provided us with the lab space needed to conduct our experiments. The Microbiology department has also provided us with essential funding to reach our experimental goals, as well as travel to the Jamboree to present our research. In particular, thank you to all graduate students in Dr. William Whitman’s Lab for equipment handling instruction. </FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The College of Engineering also played an instrumental role in our success. The graduates students provided us with much needed guidance that to ensure the success of the modeling project. Moreover, Dr. Yan’s lab was useful because of the state of the art equipment, which we were allowed to use. Finally, we are especially grateful for their financial support, which was used to defray the cost of attending the Jamboree.</FONT></P><H2>Thank you to our Archaeal InterLab participants!</H2><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:MIT">MIT</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook">Stony Brook</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Carnegie_Mellon">Carnegie Mellon</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary">William and Mary</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Vanderbilt">Vanderbilt</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Genspace">GenSpace</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:UCSF">UCSF</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Columbia_NYC">Columbia NYC</A></FONT></P><P><FONT size="4"> We would like to thank the following organizations at the University of Georgia for their generous financial support: </FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The Department of Genetics</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Franklin College of Arts and Sciences</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">The University of Georgia Alumni Association</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">President Venture Fund</FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">Office of the Vice President of Research</FONT></P><H2>Instructors</H2><H3>Dr. Zhe Lyu </H3><P>We are extremely appreciative of LZ.
