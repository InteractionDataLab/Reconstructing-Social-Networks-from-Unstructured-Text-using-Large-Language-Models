Welcome to UGA-Georgia iGEM 2015!
We have four exciting projects presented below!
Project1 - To create a library of Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) sequences for varying protein expression level in M. maripaludis
Achievement1 - Experimentally characterized 13 archaeal RBS mutants
Project2 - Establish the reproducibility, reliability and accessibility of our fluorescent measurements
Achievement2 - Created an Archaeal Collaboration Study joined by 9 iGEM teams to obtain a community data for in-depth analysis.
 
Project3 - Determine whether expression levels predicted for bacterial models would apply to Archaea
Achievement3 - No correlation observed between predicted expression levels by UTR designer and our experimental results.
 
Project4 - Model production of geraniol and biomass
Achievement4 - In silico modeled our part BBa_K1138000 in the context of flux balance analysis for improved geraniol production.
