Transformation of M3’s and M5’s occurred. 10 colonies were sequenced. Inoculation procedure for colonies certified from previous weeks gel and for other uncertified colonies occurred. </FONT></P><H5> Week 2 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Cell pellets were frozen for colonies that grew quickly. Oxygen exposure protocol was conducted on all colonies that had OD above .7. Media was made. Gel Electrophoresis and PCR was conducted on colonies that had protein extracted in previous week. </FONT></P><H5> Week 3 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Determined colonies for sequencing and DNA purification was conducted on these colonies. Inoculation of multiple colonies also occurred and two bench stocks of S0001 were subculture by transformation team. Agar media was also made. Frozen stocks were made and mutants were inoculated. </FONT></P><H5> Week 4 </H5><P><FONT size="3">- UTR Designer data gathering session and media was made. Inoculation was conducted and DNA sequencing results were determined. S001 were inoculated for transformation. </FONT></P><H4 align="center"> July </H4><H5> Week 1 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Transformation of new mutants occurred.  Oxygen Exposure Part 2 on the most recent triplicates had to conduct freeze/thaw of samples in pipes to lyse cells. Sequencing results were analyzed.</FONT></P><H5> Week 2 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Samples from the previous week were taken to the plate and fluorescent data was gathered. Data was gathered for Metabolic Modeling. Gel electrophoresis of PCR products that were made from last week’s protein extraction also occurred. </FONT></P><H5> Week 3 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Inosculation of new transformation and Oxygen procedure protocol occurred gels were ran of new tranformants. </FONT></P><H5> Week 4 </H5><P><FONT size="3">Subcultutured colonies using previously inoculated colonies that had gone into cell death. multiple gels were ran.
