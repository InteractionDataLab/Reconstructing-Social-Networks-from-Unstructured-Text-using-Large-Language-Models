General Safety
To begin, all team members were taught how to properly operate all lab equipment and were under close supervision until determined they could safely comply. Also, complete and concise protocols of all lab procedures were constantly referred to ensure the safety of team members and instructors alike. Other general topics such as proper waste disposal, attire, and cleanliness were applied to everyday lab tasks.
Organismal Safety
Due to the fact of our organism being a strict anaerobe, several precautions had to be taken to ensure its safety and hence reproducible results. All work had to be done in an anaerobic chamber, with all test tubes being sealed from the outside environment and pressurized with nitrogen. All frozen stock was kept at -80 degrees Celsius in which oxygen diffusion into the cryo-tube is negligible. All organisms used were safety level 1.
