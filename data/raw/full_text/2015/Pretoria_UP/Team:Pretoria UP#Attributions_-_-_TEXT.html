Attributions
The Team would like to thank everyone who made our iGEM experience possible. We are indebted to the numerous people, organizations, and institutions, who provided the UP Team with inspiration, support, guidance, wisdom, and funding. Without them we would never have achieved what we have, nor enjoyed this incredible experience to the extent we did.
