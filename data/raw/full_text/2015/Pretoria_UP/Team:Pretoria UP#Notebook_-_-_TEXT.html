Brainstorming workshop                               We decided to build on WITS_CSIR’s Chemotactic “Biotweet” design                               Discussed 5 potential improvements we could add:
1) E.coli torrents (information collation)                               2) Travel history                               3) ”Mob-coli”                               4) Trade routes visualisation of motile E. coli                               5) Conditional “Reply Tweet”

Split the team into smaller groups to work in parallel on each functional module in the prototype, researching previous iGEM projects with similar components and browsing the iGEM BioBrick repository for desired BioBricks

The team was now at the stage where it could decide on which components to test and how                               Recap on the different BioBrick assembly methods                               Developed procedure for characterising our constructs deciding on aspects such as choice of vector, experimental conditions and competition requirements.                               Refinement of switch: adoption of a permanent genetic switch

Decided on focusing our efforts on two modules and split the team in two groups to work on the separate modules:                               Cre recombinase switch                               AND gate                               Whatsapp and Facebook groups were created for communication purposes.                               A Google drive account was also created for the team to store all the work in one place.                               Identified possible complications with the Cre recombinase system.

Discussed the inverter switch mechanism and confirmed our design of the parts required to characterise this module.                               BioBrick specifications were discussed in context of the assembly standard 10.

Concerns raised about which plasmids to use for the experimental work to follow – multiple antibiotic resistance genes would be required.                               It was decided that the parts would be cloned into pSB plasmids for the characterisation.                               Decided that we would not have time to test the “AND” gate
