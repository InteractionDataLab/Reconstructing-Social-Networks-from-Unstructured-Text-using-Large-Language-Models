Motivation for Igem Participation
Biotechnology, although not my chosen field of study, is one of my enduring interests. The opportunity to work alongside some of South Africa’s most capable young scientists, in pursuit of a novel application for existing, and created, constructs, is extremely appealing to me on a personal level. As a Computer Science student, I lack the practical capabilities of some of my peers, but am extremely interested in learning and participating to the best of my ability.
In terms of my future studies, I believe that the knowledge gained throughout the course of this project will provide invaluable insight into unexplored approaches to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Novel problem-solving, using biologically inspired computer systems, has become a complex and fascinating part of modern information sciences; and, I believe, this project will afford me an incredibly rich learning opportunity.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I joined this team in a hope of further increasing my understanding of biotechnology, it has always interested me, and although it is not directly related to the degree I am aiming for (BSc Hons Medicinal Plants) it is a very important part of the world we live in today and its contribution to society is only growing larger each year. With endless possibilities, I felt that I needed to be a part of this community in some way, and I hope to make a large contribution to my team and also hope that my team makes a valuable contribution to scientific community.
Another reason that motivated my participation was the invaluable contribution that this opportunity would add to my CV, and the experience that would be gained in several of the laboratory techniques which will undoubtedly help me in my scientific career. In short, it is an amazing opportunity, and I am honoured to be a part of such an extraordinary team.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I have been exposed to science since a young age. My father is a virologist of the University of Pretoria and specializes in plant pathology. As a youngster I frequently accompanied to him work where I recall being fascinated by pH indicator colour changes, electron microscope images and the cabinets packed with arrays of chemicals. Growing up, my interest evolved from rocket science to (more realistically) chemistry and I finally settled on biology, specifically the molecular aspects.
I am currently engaged in an honors degree in microbiology with my research project aimed at creating a recombinant version of African horse sickness virus with a non-structural gene knock out. This project has been both challenging and engaging and I am looking forward to the remainder of the year.
I believe that society is in a revolution in which the great potential of biotechnology is being realized. Modern techniques are advancing our understanding of the fundamental workings of biological systems and new applications are being developed daily. This is undoubtedly a very exciting time to be in the position of young scientist entering a field with the resources and support currently being invested. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn about new molecular mechanisms and techniques. I look forward to meet people who have had years of experience in and share a similar appreciation for synthetic biology. Further I hope to share my experience with the members of our team and in doing so develop lasting friendships.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I’ve decided to participate in IGEM because it is a great learning experience .It provides an opportunity to learn more about the growing interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology and its applications. As a 3rd year student I have gained some theoretical knowledge in microbiology field and being a part of the IGEM team the idea of working in the lab to test the constructs and biobricks compiled in our project is quite exciting.  IGEM is also a good platform to work together with a team of aspiring scientists from different fields of study and with some great researchers as our team mentors there is plenty to learn from them.

Motivation for Igem Participation
The idea of creating new constructs and improving those previously made which may help improve all fields of science is very exciting. I had to grab the opportunity to work together with other young scientists and learn from those who have been in the field.
The global community is approaching a time where it will require innovative ways to maximize its resources. Synthetic biology is going to play a major role in an age where resources are limited and life depends heavily on science. Participating in iGEM will give me the opportunity to get a glimpse into this amazing new branch of science.  I’m hoping that my participation in this will inspire others to go into the field of science and explore the world.

Motivation for Igem Participation
I was pleased to be informed of the iGEM competition, because it provides a perfect opportunity to interact with my peers and learn from the mentors. I am eager to improve my skills in a lab environment and to adapt myself to such a working environment. I perceive this opportunity as a significant advancement in my University career and I value the experience I can gain from taking part in this competition. Furthermore, I can gain a lot of extra knowledge on subjects that do not necessarily form part of the undergraduate syllabus.
I believe that I am passionate about biology and I do enjoy working in a team environment. I realize that this is a perfect opportunity for me to gain valuable experience while I am still busy with my undergraduate studies, experience which will also be valuable in the future when I apply for work after I am done with my studies.

Motivation for Igem Participation
As a 3rd year Bsc Biotechnology student I was looking for ways in which I could learn more about my chosen field of study. Being part of the IGEM team provided that opportunity for me. I value the theory gathered from textbooks as well as the lecturers who go out of their way to ensure that we understand the things we learn in class but theory alone is nothing without being put into practice. I see IGEM as the first step to putting my knowledge to good use.
Over the last few months that I’ve been part of the IGEM team I’ve come to appreciate the beauty of science, its challenges and the solutions that it offers to real life problems.  There are a lot of areas that are still to be discovered which makes it more interesting. It has also exposed me to the vast scientific paths and careers and applications thereof. I’m grateful for this opportunity; I now have no doubt that I made the right choice in pursuing a career in science.

The three years that I have been enrolled in my field of study, I have begun to appreciate the vast capacity of application of synthetic biology. I believe that synthetic biology is the next step in the evolution of science in the 21st century. Being a part of the IGEM group has opened my eyes to the endless potential of this rapidly growing field to all components of science.
The opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people in their various fields of study is truly inspirational, as we are all able to learn from one another. I look forward to taking the knowledge that I’ve acquired and incorporating synthetic biology into human genetics.
