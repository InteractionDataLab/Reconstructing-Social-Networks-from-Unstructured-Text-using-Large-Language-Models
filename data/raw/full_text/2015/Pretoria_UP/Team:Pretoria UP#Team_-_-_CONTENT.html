My father is a virologist of the University of Pretoria and specializes in plant pathology. As a youngster I frequently accompanied to him work where I recall being fascinated by pH indicator colour changes, electron microscope images and the cabinets packed with arrays of chemicals. Growing up, my interest evolved from rocket science to (more realistically) chemistry and I finally settled on biology, specifically the molecular aspects. 	</P><P>		I am currently engaged in an honors degree in microbiology with my research project aimed at creating a recombinant version of African horse sickness virus with a non-structural gene knock out. This project has been both challenging and engaging and I am looking forward to the remainder of the year.	</P><P>		I believe that society is in a revolution in which the great potential of biotechnology is being realized. Modern techniques are advancing our understanding of the fundamental workings of biological systems and new applications are being developed daily. This is undoubtedly a very exciting time to be in the position of young scientist entering a field with the resources and support currently being invested. iGEM is a great opportunity to learn about new molecular mechanisms and techniques. I look forward to meet people who have had years of experience in and share a similar appreciation for synthetic biology. Further I hope to share my experience with the members of our team and in doing so develop lasting friendships.  	</P></DIV><DIV class="expander" id="expander3"><FONT size="1" color="grey" onclick="display(3)"> {Click for more information} </FONT></DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><H4>	Modjadji Makwela    		</H4><P>		BSc Microbiology : Focus mainly in Genetics and microbiology modules (3rd  year)</P><DIV id="hidden4"><H5>	Skills		</H5><H6>		Technical	</H6><OL><LI>		Chemistry skills- titrations , use of a spectrophotometer 	</LI><LI>		Microbiology skills- Autoclaving, seed collecting, tip packing and other basic laboratory tasks.	</LI><LI>		Computing- good typing skills	</LI></OL><H6>		Non-technical	</H6><OL><LI>		Team player	</LI><LI>		Helpful and willing to learn	</LI><LI>		Ability to work under pressure	</LI></OL><H5>	Hobbies		</H5><OL><LI>		Reading 	</LI><LI>		Drawing	</LI><LI>		Cooking	</LI></OL><H5>	Motivation for Igem Participation		</H5><P>		I’ve decided to participate in IGEM because it is a great learning experience .It provides an opportunity to learn more about the growing interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology and its applications. As a 3rd year student I have gained some theoretical knowledge in microbiology field and being a part of the IGEM team the idea of working in the lab to test the constructs and biobricks compiled in our project is quite exciting.
