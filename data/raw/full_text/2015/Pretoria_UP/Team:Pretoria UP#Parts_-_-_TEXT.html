BBa_K1768000
GFP with RBS Reverse Compliment
Description
The reverse compliment of Green fluorescent protein (GFP) Part:BBa_E0040 and and upstream Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Part:BBa_B0034
BBa_K1768001
Recombinase invertible constitutive promoter 1
Description
A reverse compliment of a constitutive promoter flanked by Lox66 and Lox71 which are recognised by the Cre enzyme and facilitates a single round of recombination between these sites. Thus the direction of the promoter can be changed allowing expression of a different gene than in the initial state. This part is the same as part BBa_K1768003 but Lox66 is upstream of the promoter with a downstream lox71.
BBa_K1768002
Quorum sensing-inducible mxiE transcription factor
Description
The LuxR receptor binds to the lux pR promoter to induce expression of the mxiE transcription factor (BBa_K1325001). mxiE forms a protein-protein interaction with the chaperone protein ipgC (BBa_K1325000) in order to transactivate the pipaH promoter (BBa_K1325004) via an "AND" operation.
BBa_K1768003
Recombinase invertible constitutive promoter 2
Description
A reverse compliment of a constitutive promoter flanked by Lox71 and Lox66 which are recognised by the Cre enzyme and facilitates a single round of recombination between these sites. Thus the direction of the promoter can be changed allowing expression of a different gene than in the initial state. This part is the same as part BBa_K1768001 but Lox71 is upstream of the promoter with a downstream lox66.
BBa_K1768002
Cre with N-terminal His tag
Description
The Cre recombinase protein open reading frame with an N-terminal His protein as an epitope for antibody recognition.
