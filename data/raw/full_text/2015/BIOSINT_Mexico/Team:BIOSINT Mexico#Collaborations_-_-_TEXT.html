This year, we had the opportunity to be in contact with many teams around the world, thanks to the Internet by contacting us.
We were able to answer several surveys, such as the Nankai Korea_U_Seoul and iGEM teams for their respective projects "712" and "iShare"
Also, to our Policy and Practices project, we asked several iGEM teams to answer a survey that evaluated the feasibility of our idea: A professional code of ethics for synthetic biology.
The teams that were helping us with this:
Technion-Israel
iGEM ​​Pasteur
iGEM ​​UNAH
WPI iGEM
Uniandes Colombia
Monterrey Tec-iGEM
iGEM ​​TecCEM
iGEM ​​Mingdao
CEM TEC HS iGEM
Manchester-Graz
iGEM ​​Stockholm
Thanks to all of you!
Furthermore, once it drafted the Code of Ethics, TecMonterrey helped us check and edit. But the work did not end there, but both teams also helped us to translate it into Swedish and French. You can review the codes of ethics in different languages ​​here
