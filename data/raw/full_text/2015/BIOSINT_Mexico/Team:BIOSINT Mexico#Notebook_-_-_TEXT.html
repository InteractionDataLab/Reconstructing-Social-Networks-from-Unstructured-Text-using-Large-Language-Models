Abstract
Here, at Team BIOSINT México, we believe that science must be a common good, which is beneficial to every human being and useful for the development of the society and the accomplishment of the greater good.
And, as a common good, science should be free and accessible for all the community, and in order to achieve this state, we should take actions that are directed towards socializing the knowledge with the public.
As our actions, and those of the SynBio community, should not have as a goal the public recognition neither the economical reward, they should be considered a form of art.
We consider that the easiest way for the public to acknowledge the current development of the scientific research, specially regarding the field of Synthetic Biology, is by the participation and socialization of this topics in a way that results comprehensible and easy to recognize and understand for the general public.
Therefore, art and its capacity to transcend the time and space, and the universal meaning it has, turn out to be the best possible way to share the knowledge in a meaningful, fun and effective way.

Cloramphenicol: 5ul/ml
Kanamicin: 25 ul/ml
Ampicilin: 50 ul/ml
CaCl2 Competent Cells
Streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells (Top10, DH5α, etc.) onto an LB plate (no antibiotics since these cells do not have a plasmid in them). Work sterile. Grow plate overnight at 37°C.
Make sure to autoclave 1 L LB (or your preferred media), 1 L of 100 mM CaCl2, 1 L of 100 mM MgCl2, 100 mL of 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v, 4 centrifuge bottles and caps, lots of microfuge tubes
Chill overnight at 4°C 100 mM CaCl2, 100 mM MgCl2, 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v
Prepare starter culture of cells
Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 10 mL starter culture of LB (or your preferred media – no antibiotics). Grow culture at 37°C in shaker overnight.
For the next day, inoculate 1 L of LB media with 10 mL starter culture and grow in 37°C shaker.
Measure the OD600 every hour, then every 15-20 minutes when the OD getsabove 0.2.
When the OD600 reaches 0.35-0.4, immediately put the cells on ice. Chill the culture for 20-30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling. Place centrifuge bottles on ice at this time.
(Spin #1) Split the 1 L culture into four parts by pouring about 250 mL into ice cold centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet in about 100 mL of ice cold MgCl2. Combine all suspensions into one centrifuge bottle. Make sure to prepare a blank bottle as a balance.
(Spin #2) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g in the refrigerated centrifuge (~3000 rpm) for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in about 200 mL of ice cold CaCl2. Keep this suspension on ice for at least 20 minutes. Start putting 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice if not already chilled.
(Spin #3) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g (~3000 rpm) for 15 minutes at 4°C. At this step, rinse a 50 mL conical tube with ddH2O and chill on ice.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in ~50 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol. Transfer the suspension to the 50 mL conical tube.
(Spin #4) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2100) for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol. The final OD600 of the suspended cells should be ~200-250.
Aliquot 50 μL into sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen. Store frozen cells in the -80°C freezer.
Heat Shock Transformation of E. coli
Note: Never vortex competent cells. Mix cells by gentle shaking.
Thaw competent cells on ice. These can be prepared using the CaCl2 protocol.
Place 20 ul of cells in a pre-chilled Eppendorf tube.
For an Intact Vector: Add 0.5 ul or less to the chilled cells
For a Ligation Product: Add 2-3 ul to the chilled cells.
Mix gently by flicking the tube.
Chill on ice for 10 minutes. (Optional)
Heat shock at 42 °C for 50 seconds.
Incubate on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200 ul LB, Terrific or SOC medium and recover the cells by shaking at 37 °C.
The recovery time varies with the antibiotic selection.
Ampicillin: 15-30 minutes
Kanamycin or Spectinomycin: 30-60 minutes
Chloramphenicol: 60-120 minutes
Plate out the cells on selective LB. Use glass beads to spread the cells. The volume of cells plated depends on what is being transformed.
For an Intact Vector: High transformation efficiencies are expected. Plating out 10 ul of recovered cells should produce many colonies.
For a Ligation Product: Lower transformation efficiencies are expected. Therefore you can plate the entire 200 ul volume of recovered cells.
Incubate at 37 °C. Transformants should appear within 8 – 16 hrs.
Transformation by Electroporation
Preparation of Electrocompetent Cells
Competent cells should never be vortexted, as this will cause them to lyse and release salts into the media. Resuspend cells by pipeting up and down with a large pasteur pipet. Once they are chilled, cells should be continuously cold.
The night before the transformation, start an overnight culture of cells. 5 ml LB Amp.
The day of the transformation, dilute the cells 100X. 100 ml LB Amp.
Grow at 30°C for about 90 minutes.
Harvest the cells. When the cells reach an OD600 of between 0.6 and 0.8.
Split the culture into 2x 50 ml falcon tubes, on ice.
Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 4000 rpm.
Wash and combine the cells.
Remove the supernatant.
Resuspend the cells in 2x 25 ml of ice cold water.
Combine the volumes in a single 50 ml falcon tube.
Wash the cells 2 more times.
Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 4000 rpm.
Resuspend in 50 ml of ice cold water.
Repeat.
Wash and concentrate the cells for electroporation.
Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 4000 rpm.
Resuspend in 1-2 ml of ice cold water.
We will use 200 ul of washed cells per transformation.
Dialysis of PCR or Digestion Products
DNA for electroporation must be free of salts to avoid arcing.
Float a filter in a Petri dish filled with water.
Millipore membrane filter 0.025 uM.
Pipet one drop of PCR product onto the filter.
200 ng is needed per transformation.
20 - 100 ul fits well on one filter.
Collect the drop after 30 - 45 minutes.
The volume will change, but the DNA is not lost.

The column was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes.
(The eppendorf tube contains the purified plasmid).
Plasmid purification by Midiprep
Harvest the cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 12000 rpm in the mini-spin. Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pelleted cells in 2 mL of Resuspension Solution auditioned with RNase solution. The bacterial pellet should be resuspended by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Add 2 mL of Lysis Solution and mix gently by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature.
Add 0.5 mL of the Endotoxin Binding Reagent. Mix immediately by inverting the tube 5-8 times.
Incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Note. After the addition of the Neutralization Solution and Endotoxin Binding Reagent it is important to mix gently, but thoroughly, to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris. The neutralized bacterial lysate should appear cloudy and contain white precipitate.
Add 3 mL of 96% ethanol. Mix immediately by inverting the tube 5-6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000-5,000 rpm to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.

Electrophoresis Agarose Gel
For each 100 ml of electrophoresis gel, weight 1 g of agarose.
Dissolve in the adequate amount of 1x TAE Buffer.
Heat in constant agitation. It could be done in microwave by heating in short intervals and agitating manually.
When completely dissolved let the flask cool a little then and 1.2 l of ethidium bromide 5 % p/p for each 50 ml of gel.
Agitate until it’s completely dissolved. If not used immediately store at 4 °C.
Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the suitable well comb in place (pour slowly to avoid bubbles which will disrupt the gel).
Place newly poured gel at room temperature for 20-30 minutes, until the gel has completely solidified.
Once solidified, remove the comb and place the gel into the electrophoresis unit (gel box).
Fill the gel box with 1x TAE buffer.
Load GeneRuler 1Kb Plus DNA Ladder 0.1 ug/ml weight one lane of the gel.
Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel, carefully mixed with 6X DNA Loading Dye.
Run the gel at 50-150V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel (20-45 min).
Use an UV light transilluminator to observe the DNA fragments on the gel.

The electrotransformation efficiency may be improved by heat inactivation of T4 DNA ligase at 65°C for 10 min or at 70°C for 5 min
The overall number of transformants may be increased by extending the reaction time to 1 hour.
If more than 2 u of T4 DNA ligase is used in 20 μl reaction mixture, it is necessary to purify DNA (by spin column or chloroform extraction) before electrotransformation.
