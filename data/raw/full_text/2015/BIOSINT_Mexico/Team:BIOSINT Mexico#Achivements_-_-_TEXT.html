spisPink & amilGFP optimized to Escherichia coli K12
After completing the insertion of gBlocks (IDT) designed (spisPink and amilGFP), into the plasmid pSB1C3, by following the relevant protocols; competent cells were successfully transformed and consequently the removal of plasmids (spisPink into pSB1C3) BBa_K1684000 and (amilGFP into pSB1C3) BBa_K1684001 was performed.
The Figure 6 presents a 1% agarose gel which contains two samples, by triplicate, next to the ladder. In line 1, 2 and 3 are located the triplicate samples of spisPink piece, optimized for E. coli K12 (BBa_K1684000), with a size of 2789 bp. Likewise on the line 4,5 and 6 are repeated samples of the piece amilGFP optimized for E. coli K12 (BBa_K1684001). For both BioBricks, the electrophoresis results correspond to the theoretical size, greater than 2500 bp and less than 3000 bp; also it can be seen that there is no variation between samples, replicas, indicating the reliability of E. coli K12 transformations.

RBS and Optimized biobricks
In Figure 7 different samples of parts used for transformation of competent cells; these two parts are composite biobricks, the first is composed by RBS (BBa_B0034) and the optimized chromoprotein sequence spisPink for E. coli K12 (BBa_K1684000), while the second is composed by a RBS (BBa_B0034) and the optimized chromoprotein sequence amilGFP (BBa_K1684001 ).
The agarose gel shown in Line 1, the negative control; Line 2, belongs to the purified DNA of pGLO (5371 bp), was run as a positive control. Line 3 and Line 4 contain duplicate products of BBa_K1684002 (BBa_B0034 + BBa_K1684000) biobrick, both results match the size of the plasmids, 2800 bp. Line 5 and Line 6 contain duplicate BBa_K1684003 (BBa_B0034 + BBa_K1684001) biobrick; however, a positive result is observed only in Line 5, with size of 2822 bp, while in line 6 only presents contamination, without the presence of any genetic material.

Optimized biobricks with Terminator
Finally, in Figure 8 samples composite parts are presented, the first BBa_K1684004, is composed of the chromoprotein sequence optimized for E. coli K12 spisPink (BBa_K1684000) and a terminator (BBa_B0010); the second part is composed of the chromoprotein optimized sequence amilGFP (BBa_K1684001) and the same terminator (BBa_B0010). This agarose gel shown on Line 1 and Line 2, the biobrick BBa_K1684004, in the first case the band run corresponding to its size, 2869 bp; however, on Line 2 the result was not the expected and only contamination was obtained.
In Line 3 and 4 results, was run the composite BioBrick BBa_K1684005, in the first case the result was not successful; In Line 4 however, the band is present with the respective size, 2890 bp, as a positive result. Finally on Line 5 is presented only the negative control.

First Summer Camp: Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology
The camp activity intended to raise awareness to the preparatory community of young people about synthetic biology. In this activity, which it lasted three days, the BIOSINT_Mexico team, supported by teachers and school physical plant staff, taught workshops on various themes and concepts related to the fundamentals of synthetic biology; also small and simple laboratory practices were conducted. One of the intentions of the camp was to share our knowledge of this new scientific branch to the youth; but above all, the goal was to teach young people in an entertaining way; the best way to learn!.
