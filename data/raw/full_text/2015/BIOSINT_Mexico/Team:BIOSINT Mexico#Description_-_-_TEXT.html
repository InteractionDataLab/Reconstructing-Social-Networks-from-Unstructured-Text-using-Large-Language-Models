Project Description
Tell us about your project, describe what moves you and why this is something important for your team.
What should this page contain?
A clear and concise description of your project.
A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.
References and sources to document your research.
Use illustrations and other visual resources to explain your project.
Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
