Advisors
We would like to thank our advisors Professor Natalie Farny and Professor Joseph Duffy for their support and guidance on this project. Professor Duffy was a stalwart supporter of our program and was instrumental in securing funding and resources for our project. Professor Farny was a mentor and constant source of direction throughout our project, providing invaluable knowledge, feedback, advice, and donuts. Both advisors have our deepest gratitude.
Our Team
Our team worked in pairs to specialize in various areas of research. While we all helped each other and contributed to the project we would like to give special thanks the pairs for their significant contributions in specific areas. We would like to thank team members Kayla DeSanty and Julie Mazza for their work with the biofilm assay. We would like to thank team members Chloe LaJeunesse and Charlotte Reames for their work on the freeze survival assay. We would like to thank team members Edward Dring and David Morgan for their work on cloning. All team members worked on the content of this wiki, however Chloe LaJeunesse deserves special thanks for her instrumental work in the design and creation of the wiki.
