AFPs have tremendous promise in biotechnology applications including cryogenic tissue preservation, freeze tolerance in crops, and improvement in the quality of frozen foods. AFPs have been utilized in a limited way by a number of previous iGEM teams, though very few AFPs have been analyzed thoroughly for use in <I>E. coli</I>, and rarely have they been explored comparatively. One of the most exciting new applications for APFs has only recently been discovered: Heisig et al. (2014) showed that a tick antifreeze glycoprotein, IAFGP, was disruptive to the formation of biofilms--cooperative structures formed by bacteria that contribute to serious problems in manufacturing, food processing, and human health. It remains unknown whether this biofilm-inhibiting property is a common feature of APFs or is specific to AFPs with particular structures or sequences.</P><P style="text-indent: 2em;">Our aim is to create a library of antifreeze proteins collected from diverse kingdoms of life and, by engineering <I>E. coli</I> to express them, test their antifreeze and biofilm-disruption properties. In addition, we hope to determine whether expressing multiple antifreeze proteins confers a cooperative advantage over single proteins. Finally, we plan to use the information learned to design synthetic antifreeze proteins for <I>E. coli</I>, idealized for either surviving low temperatures or disrupting biofilms. Our project will create a new toolkit for the synthetic biology community that will facilitate the development of synthetic systems that must survive in subzero temperatures, in addition to providing a potentially novel method for the control of biofilm dynamics.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
