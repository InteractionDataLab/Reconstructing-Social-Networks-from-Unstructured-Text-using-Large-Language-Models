Until now, the only documented antifreeze protein in the iGEM parts registry was ZeAFP . This year, the WPI iGEM team set out to build a library of antifreeze proteins for future iGEM teams and to characterize the freeze surivival and biofilm inhibiting properties of each antifreeze proteins. We successfully created a library of 39 coding, generator, and composite BioBricks consisting of 16 unique antifreeze proteins. All of the BioBricks in our library are listed in the table below.
