The strains we tested were JW4283, a fim H knockout and negative control for biofilm formation, and C2M+C5 and C9-3+C5, which express modified pili when induced by arabinose and rhamnose. Upon receiving agar stabs from the Harvard team, we streaked plates and incubated them at 37oC for 24 hours. Afterwards, we placed the plates in the refrigerator until we received the arabinose and rhamnose needed to induce pili formation in the experimental strains. Once we had all necessary materials, we grew 5mL liquid cultures of each of the 3 strains in LB in accordance with the protocol. The JW4283 culture was not supplemented with antibiotics or inducers, but the C2M+C5 and C9-3+C5 cultures were supplemented with 5 μL of chloramphenicol, 5 μL of ampicillin, 0.01% arabinose, and 0.5% rhamnose. We prepared the 1:100 dilutions in LB broth and M9 minimal media, which we found to support biofilm formation while designing our biofilm assay. The remainder of the protocol was left unchanged. Below are the results of the assay.</H10></P><P><CENTER><I>A photo of the biofilm plate after it was stained with crystal violet on 9/3/15.

These strains may be able to form biofilms under different conditions. Further investigation would have to be done to determine if different if different media types, incubation periods, or transformation into different strains of E. coli  could induce biofilm formation. Determining optimal biofilm formation conditions could allow the Harvard team to use the biofilm assay to gather quantitative results for their various binding assays. However, it is possible that the modified pili interfere with biofilm formation. In that case, the biofilm assay would not be a valid method of quantification.</H10></P><H3>Harvard</H3><P style="text-indent: 2em;"><H10>The Harvard team tested our TiAFP and BclA-TiAFP antifreeze proteins in the <A href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140917/ncomms5945/abs/ncomms5945.html">curli strain</A>, a strain of <I>E. coli</I> expressing modified CsgA fusion proteins. This strain, which forms biofilms, was developed by the Joshi lab and therefore readily available to the Harvard team. They followed our general biofilm protocol, linked above, with the exception of the following conditions:</H10></P><P style="text-indent: 2em;"><H10>1. Round-bottom plates at the Wyss were not sanitary so we used two flat-bottom plates.</H10></P><P style="text-indent: 2em;"><H10>2.

The plate reader results can be seen below.

Repetitions of the assay will have to be done in the future to verify our results.</H10></P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
