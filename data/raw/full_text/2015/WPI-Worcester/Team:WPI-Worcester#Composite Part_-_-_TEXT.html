TiAFP
The antifreeze protein TiAFP was isolated from the arctic snow fungus Typhula ishikariensis by Xiao et al. in 2010. We decided to follow though with this AFP in the interest of diveristy of the library as it's fungal origin was unique in our collection. TiAFP was incorporated into BBa_K1809013 , an untagged AFP with the promoter J23119.  TiAFP was analysed in our biofilm assay and displayed some of the greatest biofilm inhibition of the entire library, decreasing biofilm formation by 31.8%, as can be seen in the graph below. TiAFP was also analysed using the freeze survival assay, though results were inconclusive, as can be seen in the graph below.
