The Team
We are a big multinational team. Our different studies of sciences and engineering enable us to perform a multifaceted project. The scope ranges from biological aspects like the conversion of methanol to glycogen over engineering aspects like the building of a DIY bioreactor and developing the corresponding software up to accomplish an extensive public outreach. Our team is complemented by the great cluster of the Research Center Jülich and the RWTH Aachen University, which combine research with the power of engineering.
