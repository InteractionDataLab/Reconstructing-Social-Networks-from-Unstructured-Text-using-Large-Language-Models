Successful Sequencing of Polycistronic Construct
Building BioBricks out of polycistronic plasmid
15-08-19
Next steps
build RuMP pathway (AP19.mdh.hps.phi, like MCC but without xpk, for comparison)
bring the polycistronic construct into pSB1C3 (to provide it as a BioBrick) and into pSB1K3 (to characterize it further) METHODS:
CPEC
restriction with XbaI and SpeI and ligation
restiction with EcoRI and PstI and ligations
Gibson Assembly
digestion with XbaI and SpeI, then digestion with alkaline phosphatase, then ligation
15-08-17 polycistronic expression test

Results:
mdh: (expected 40,7 kDa) is visible as a big band in Q1Q3
phi+hps: (expected 20 & 22,6 kDa) there is a big band between 17 & 26 kDa
xpk: (expected 92 kDa) is visible as a big band in #Q1Q3#

Tasks for following days
masterplates and overnight cultures of transformations !!!red-white screening!!! (see above)  (sunday, 15-08-30) done
plasmid purification and cryos of overnights cultures  (monday, 15-08-31)
test digest for screening (monday, 15-08-31)
strategic decission on what to send in for sequencing (monday, 15-08-31)
is it possible to have all required BioBrick and expression plasmids sequenced and validated on wednesday? If yes, then we' ll have to concentrate on generating relieable data. If not, a small group has to focus on cloning, until it is finished. (monday, 15-08-31)

Summary
Our aim is to get AP19.Poly in the BioBrick backbones pSB1C3 and pSB1K3. Later this day we can make masterplates and overnight cultures of the AP19 clones in both backbones. Tomorrow plasmid purification and test digest will follow.
In the evening of wednesday we will prepare sequencing. We need positive clones of:
AP19.Poly in pSB1C3
AP19.Poly in pSB1K3
TODO for today
Night: AP19.Poly in K3 and AP19.Poly in C3 Masterplates and overnights

overnights of AP19.Poly in pSB1K3 didn't grow the night, so they were made again at 15:30
all purified plasmids of AP19.Poly in K3 are sceened by sequencing with one primer
ONE succesfull overnight of AP19.Poly in K3
15-09-03
from the AP19.Poly in pSB1K3 constructs just the overnight of #6 grew, these will be prepared for plasmid purification and tests (test digest/PCR)
as restriction ligation strategy for biobrick constructs seems to be not reliable, we try Gibson Assembly for AP19.Poly in C3/K3

Gibson Assembly transformation
The Gibson Assembly masterplates show also clones when no Gibson MM was used (just transformation of linar [?] DNA parts), so we can't trust the colonies on the plates with mastermix
DpnI digest seems not to work, so the ligation product was digested with DpnI again (1 µl of Schwaneberg DpnI, 1 µl of S2 DpnI, all afternoon at 37 °C)
after 9 h of incubation, constructs were transformed in BL21 (AP19.Poly in pSB1K3-constructs) and DH5alpha (AP19.Poly in pSB1C3-constructs)

plasmid purification and test digests:
only use 1.5 ml of culture
ID distribution of temporary prepped plasmids for analytic purposes:
AP19 Poly in K3: PK 1-15
AP19 Poly in C3: PC 1-15
store rest of the cultures in 4 °C room
do test digest with EcoRI and PstI of:
AP19 Poly in K3 "minipreps" of overnigths from Gibson Assembly
AP19 Poly in C3 "minipreps" of overnights from Gibson Assembly
wait for results, then purify remaining culture volume (this time with plasmid purification kit) of positive clones and prepare for sequencing.
use masterplates to inoculate new liquid cultures
maybe we need more volume to purifiy

alkaline phosphatase digestion
Last try (!!!) to get polycistronic construct into a BioBrick vector just as much work as absulutely necessary will be invested in this workflow
Added 1 µl of phosphatase to #OLAE#:D and #OLAE#:E. Incubation for 20' at 37 °C.
Ligation with #OLAE#:F. Product: #9VCN#: I (in pSB1C3) + II (in pSB1K3)
Transformation of 5 µl into BL21 Gold (DE3)

new purified plasmids of #9PBD# (MDH in pSB1C3), #H4M9# (HPS in pSB1C3) and #KFEY# (XPK in pSB1C3)
overnights of AP19.Poly in pSB1C3 that grew were all red, in these in pSB1K3 did not grow
new overnights were made from master plate at 10:00 am
15-09-12
even though there were colonies on the LB plate from the transformation, the clones didn't grow in a liquid LB overnight cultures!
all 15 clones didn't grow in overnight culture, even after several trials!
SEEMS LIKE SUCCESSFULL TRANSFORMATIONS OF POLYCISTRONIC CONSTRUCT IN BIOBRICK BACKBONE CAN'T GROW
NO POLYCISTRONIC CONSTRUCT IN BIOBRICK BACKBONE WILL BE SEND TO THE REGISTRY!
