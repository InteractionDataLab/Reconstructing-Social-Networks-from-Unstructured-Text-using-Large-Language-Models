Biotec lab; Attendens: Laura G., Tobi, Sarah, Sven
consumable material: petri dishes 2x
Promotor Library
We did another purification of cut agarose gel with J61002+LacI. The concentration measurement was nonsense.
It had to be checked if we already have enough backbone template for restriction and ligation.
We digested the backbone (different enzymes  for "with LacI-BS" and "normal") and heat inactivated.
Next steps (in general)
restriction with Xba and EcoRI of backbone (DRPV) in 10 preparations with 20 µl reaction volume each (this is enough for 100 ligations). Incubation at 37 °C for 40 min and heat inactivation at 80 °C for 20 min. Done for backbone with and without lacI. Freezed at -20 °C.
Restriction with Spe and EcoRI of each promotor in 1 preparation with 20 µl volume each (enough for 10 ligation for each promotor). Incubate at 37 °C for 40 min and heat inactivation at 80 °C for 20 min. Freezed at -20 °C.
For ligation , 2 µl of each DNA part from restriction is necessary.

for ligation is 2 µl of each DNA part from restriction necessary. Every restricted promotor is ligated in new backbone with lacI. Everything is freezed -20 °C in Falkon #2.

Biotec lab; Attendens: Laura G., Tobi
consumable material: DH5α
Promotor library:
Heatshock transformation of ligation products in DH5α , plate them on Amp-plates (clones with new lacI promotor should be colorless, the five clones with original promotors should be as red as their strength). We used 3 µl of ligation product on ca. 50 µl  of competent cells. After 30 minutes ice, 45 seconds water bath, 2 minutes ice we added 200 µl  of preheated SOC medium. Incubation for 1 hour (37 °C /250 rpm)
Plates incubate at 37 °C since 16:50.
next steps:
pick single clones from all transformations (19+4) for overnight cultures.
15-05-19
Biotec lab; Attendens: Laura G., Tobi, Sven
consumable material:
new LB-Amp-plates
Promotor library:
In generel poor cell growth but there are colonies on every plate. However, also the 5 promotors (08,09,11,15,19) in the original backbone (without LacI binding site) are white. They should be red. They might turn to red with more time?
We did masterplates (with 6 clones of each) of all transformations. J23102 and -09 only had as few colonies as there are spread on the masterplates.
We make overnight cultures from J23108 ori, -15 ori, -19 ori, -11 ori, -06, -17, -16, -05. "Ori" stands for the original J61002 backbone without LacI binding site.
Next steps:
Do cryos, plasmid preps and prepare sequencing from the overnight cultures (results might come on Friday)
Colony PCR from masterplates (on Thursday):Which primers would we use to check the orientation of our insert?

Sequencing results were aligned to planned sequences. All samples were negative. K1585114 und K1585107 had a point mutation in every promoter. We assume this mutation was introduced by PCR since it is present in all otherwise positive samples of the respective construct. A detailed overview can be found under sequencing results.

K1585119 was cultivated with and without IPTG to test the expression in comparison to the constitutive J23119. Cultures of J23108 and J23111 contructs looked slighty reddish on the transformation plates. This is expected since they are both medium strength promoters.

We discarded cryos and purified plasmids of the last unsuccessful sequencing.  Plasmid preps of J23108, 09, 11 and K1585107, 08, 09, 11, 14. Three clones each. Prepared sequencing samples of those constructs Comparison between J23119, K1585119 and K1585119 + IPTG. The constitutive promoter J23119 showed a strong rfp expression as expected. Both K1585119 cultures showed only a very weak expression. Repression via the LacI binding site therefore seems to be working as intended whereas the induction with IPTG failed. This may be caused by a too low IPTG concentration. To ensure this the experiment has to be repeated with multiple IPTG concentrations.
Note: It took quite a long time till rfp expression was visible, even the J23119 culture was still not red after 16h incubation.

Characterisation
Overnights of J23119 (constitutive, #BYS8#), K1585119 induced and non-induced (#CKYR# and #YFV9#) and pSB1K30 (positive control) to verify whether or not our IPTG stock is fine.
Induced cultures were prepared in 3 concentrations each: 0.2x (1 µM), 1x (5 µM) and 5x (25 µM).
pSB1K30 in NEB Turbo is used as positive control. Note: Plasmid with kanamycin resistance!

Do DpnI digest of J23107 & J23108 for 1,5h plus heat inactivation.
Result of induction test (only visual with green light):
constitutive J23119 has the strongest red colour. Not induced K30 & AP19 are colourless. Strain #CKYR# and #YFV9# have always the same colour under the same conditions. Induced K30 is always a little less colourful as the induced AP19s (that is unexpected). 0,2x IPTG shows no difference to not induced cultures. 1x IPTG is slightly red. 5x IPTG have red colour but not as strong as the constitutive one.
Experiment gives hardly any usable information. J23119 should clearly show a strong pink/red color visible in regular light (see documentation 15-06-17). The negative result of the J23119 implies that there might be some problems with cultivation. Cultures might not get enough oxygen to form the rfp (people at bio6 sometimes forget to switch on the shaker after they removed their samples).
'New Induction Test':
Same setup as before. This time we used shakers at the iAMB. Both IPTG stocks are tested at the same time
Overnights of J23119 (constitutive, #BYS8# from 2 different plates), K1585119 induced (3 times) and non-induced from #CKYR# and pSB1K30 in NEB Turbo ## induced 3 times and one not induced (Note: Plasmid with kanamycin resistance!)
For induction we used two different IPTG stocks 50x & 1000x.
Induced cultures were prepared in 3 concentrations each: 1x (5 µM), 5x (25 µM) and 10x (50 µM).
Incubation at 37 °C starting at 16:00.
Results:
J23119 cultures both show a very strong pink color after 24 h of incubation. All other cultures do not show a significant amount of rfp expression. Positive control is negative due to the use of a wrong strain (NEB Turbo is a cloning strain without T7 polymerase)
Next time we use BBa_I13507 in pSB1A30 in BL21 with Cas9 to express RFP (Cas9 will be destroied at 37 °C) (alternatively BBa_I13507 in pSB1A30 in BL21 is in Cryo #6DA3#). And pSB1K30 in BL21 (#KK16#).

Induction Test:
Repeat of the previous induction experiment. This time we used pSB1K30 and pSB1A30 (both induced 1x and not induced to test). One J23119 culture was used as positive control for general rfp expression.
Results:
Positive control was negative even after 40 h. Cultivation in bio6 shakers probably does not provide enough oxygen to enable rfp processing. We will try to do a first real characterization experiment in deep well plates next week. Aerobic conditions should not be a problem there.

We did a cryo wellplate with all verified promoters: 90 µl of 50 % glycerol to the overnight wellplate. Freezed in -80 °C in Bio7.
From this cryo wellplate we inoculated 2 wellplates with LB+Amp, one of these plates with IPTG.
We measured fluorescence and OD in the platereader every hour. We measured both OD and fluoresence to understand a possible correlation between both factors.
Note: mRFP has its excitation peak at 584nm and its emission peak at 607nm wavelength.

We did not do a measurement at the beginning because grey plates do not fit in the platereader. For measurement the cultures get transfered into black wells with glas bottom.
Incubation at 30 °C and 300 rpm started at 10:10 a.m.
We did an OD/F measurement at 19:00 because there should be some spots with only LB media as reference.

Results Summary
14 different Anderson Promoters are present in backbone J61002 with RFP (E1010) as control between the SpeI & PstI restriction sites.
These 14 Anderson Promoters are also present with an lacI-binding site.
The inhibition by lacI works perfectly.
The induction with IPTG is not significantly possible.
