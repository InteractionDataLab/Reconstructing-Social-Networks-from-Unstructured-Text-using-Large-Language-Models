Judging
We have fulfilled all medal criteria for Bronze, Silver and Gold. Please find details below.
Bronze Requirements (6/6)
Our team was successfully registered.
The judging form was completed.
We created our own Wiki.
We are excited to present our poster and project talk at the Giant Jamboree.
The different work of our project was attributed on the respective wiki page.
We submitted K1585320 among several other new BioBricks to the iGEM registry.
Silver Requirements (3/3)
We characterized K1585210 as part of the implementation of the MCC in E. coli and beyond that multiple successful gene knockouts.
This part was submitted to the registry.
Looking beyond our own lab work, we pursued an open dialogue about the chances and risks of community labs in Germany with Team Darmstadt, the Technik Garage and the Waag Society. We also discussed this subject at a symposium at our university. In order to help community labs with their organization, we had tubefront tested and valued it as a suitable software for that matter.
Gold Requirements (4/2)
On top of the aspects of mentioned in the Silver Medal Requirement, our team engaged in innovative human practices activities by starting of an educational advance following the principle of "teach the teacher" . Thereby, we provided teachers and community labs with materials for school experiments and worked out a possible interdisciplinary lesson based on our DIY bioreactor.
We demonstrated a functional prototype of glycogen accumulation systems, combining a functional operon with successful gene knockouts. We were the first to use CRISPR/Cas9 at our institute.
We helped Team UiOslo Norway establishing their methane sensor and elaborated the Nash assay as an effective way of testing their methane dehydrogenase.
We significantly improved an existing BioBrick by building a polycistronic construct of all glycogen forming genes , hereby extending the function of BBa_K118020 (Edinburgh 2008)
