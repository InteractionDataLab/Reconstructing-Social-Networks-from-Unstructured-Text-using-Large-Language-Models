The broad scope of DIY Biology
Following in the footsteps of iGEM Aachen 2014, we are building custom made hardware for custom made biology. Since there was no suitable design in any DIY platform (e.g. Hackteria.org, DIYBIO.ORG, Appropedia.org) we started to build our bioreactor system right from scratch. While demonstrating our first prototype at the MakerFaire in Hannover, we were fascinated by the exhibited DIY Biology projects. Inspired by the creativity and commitment of the "Makers", we decided take a deeper look into the European Community Lab scene.
Since not only iGEM teams but also Community Labs shared our problems with the organization of samples in the fridge, we developed tubefront , an organisation software for biological samples. Speaking of software, the use of software on computers, smartphones or tablets increases in laboratories all around the world. But is it safe to bring in these? In collaboration with iGEM Team Slovenia, we considered respective biosafety aspects by analyzing how many microbes live on the surfaces of such devices.
During the course of our project, we had the pleasure to meet and collaborate with a great number of passionate and creative partners inside and outside of the iGEM community. At our "Collaborations" page, we tell you about our active collaborations and more!
