The Future
After some trouble in iGEM 2014 that was partially induced by lack of documentation, we revolutionized the way how wetlab work was documented in our lab. Early in the project, we developed tubefront to keep track of each and every sample in our freezers.
By combining it with an instance of MediaWiki on our internal server, we were able to efficiently document everything from meeting protocols to financial stuff.
In all wetlab submodules, independent chronological documentation was done by the team members planning and doing the experiments. The following list covers all pages where detailed documentation about biological parts can be found.
