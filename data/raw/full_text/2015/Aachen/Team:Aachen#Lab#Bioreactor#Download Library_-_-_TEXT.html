The Future
Our goal was to finally create a detailed guide to construct a Do-It-Yourself Bioreactor. We have developed the basic devices and some structures but it can always be upgraded. We would like to give everyone the opportunity to try to customize it as per the needs of their experiments. Some of the prerequisites are a Lasercutter and a 3D printer. So get hold of them and start using these files.
Software Packages
Aachen_MasterControlprogram.zip
Aachen_PumpCalibrator.zip
Aachen_ODCalibrator.zip
The Source code of the whole Master Control Program software suite is available in the igemsoftware GitHub repository under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.0.
Hardware Design Files
Aachen_Lasercutter_files.zip
3D printer:
Aachen_PumpRotor.zip
Aachen_Stirrer.zip
Aachen_OD_Module.zip
Aachen_MainCircuit.zip
Further, we also provide software tools to help the end-user in recreating our project. Additional programs are made available to debug, test and run the bioreactor. The Arduino Firmware is available in two versions: one to enable the slaves to talk to each other (scalable) and the other one to provide higher possible aeration rates, but without inter slave communication.
Arduino firmware:
Pump debug/test: Aachen_PumpProg.zip
Stirrer debug/test: Aachen_StirrerDebug.zip
Pump Calibrator: Aachen_PumpCalibrator.zip
OD debug/test: Aachen_OD_final.zip
Final Arduino-Bioreactor Firmware:
with inter slave communication: Aachen_Slave_Com.zip
without inter slave communication: Aachen_without_Com.zip
