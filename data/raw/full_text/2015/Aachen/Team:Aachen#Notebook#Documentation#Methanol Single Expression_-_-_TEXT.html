because backbone is probably not well digested (and because we have all four genes right now!!), we make the restriction and ligation again

We picked only "red" clones, because we forgot to induce with IPTG.
with green light the red flourescence could be observed very well
we picked the few white clones and put them on a masterplate LB+K
next step will be a new colony PCR on monday.

We have to think about a new strategy, as the Biobrick assembly seems not to work
15-06-29
A new beginning! Work carefully! Our new approach is to ligate the RBS.CDS constructs into a prefix cut (with EcoRI and XbaI)  pSB1A3 vector containing the B0015.
In a next step we will swap the RBS.CDS.B0015 constructs into pSB1K30 backbones.
Monday and Wednesday are the days with the most workload, while tuesday and thursday give space to plan further steps
cut #FW6L# with EcoRI and XbaI; reaction volume: 50 µl; water: 36.3 µl; DNA: 6.7 µl

expected lengths:
BEX: 19 bp / 2273 bp (bands at expected length)

Products are stored in Falcon #FPTS#
ligation
Backbone J61002.J23119 (cut with SpeI/PstI) in #TF4M# Tube1 (derived from #AHZ6#) is already digested.
Ligate the backbone with each construct, products are stored in #YMVY#
Transformation
Heatshock transformation in BL21; plate on LB+Amp plates.
15-07-28
Masterplates of many transformants and overnights of 6 clones each.
15-07-29
Do colony PCR with masterplates with #A9W9# & #XE3D# (chosen annealing temp. 58 °C). (negative with RFP 1143bp, positive Hps 939 bp, positive Phi 858 bp, positive MDH 1461 bp).
results of cPCR and red/white screening disagree. In both screenings positive: phi #3, hps #1,2,3,4,5
do NEW masterplates and overnights.
15-07-30
Colony PCR on new masterplates
this time with one primer that binds on the backbone (#A9W9#) and an insert-specific reverse primer (for mdh: #MSP1#, hps:#HSP2#, phi:#PSP2#)
based on the colony PCR, overnights of mdh #4&5, phi #3&5 and hps #1,2,3 were used for cryos and plasmid purification.
cryo cultures: #4EMV# #3PVM#; #1MDN# #38L9#; #KL96# #B39O# #BEZO#
purified plasmids: #PS1M# #ONMP#; #LSHO# #KQ1W#; #MXYY# #1DPL# #KTZ8#
test digest of plasmids with EcoRI. Expected length of hps.J61002: 2731bp; phi.J61002: 2650; mdh.J61002: 3253bp; negative rfp.J61002: 2987 bp
15-08-03
run test digest from 30th July on gel: mdh#4, Mdh#5, phi#3, phi#5, hps#1, hps#2, hps#3; all bands at expected lenght
repeat colony PCR for hps with #A9W9# and #HSP2#; expected lenght is 621 bp, chosen annealing Temp 58 °C
overnight cultures of successful clones
15-08-05
Prepare three main cultures (hps #KL96#, mdh #3PVM#, phi #1MDN#). RFP control #13YN# did not grow. We have to use #BYS8#
Prepare 2 SDS (12 % for Mdh; 15 % for Hps, Phi) gels for tomorrow.
Preculture of #BYS8#
Tomorrow: Prepare cell pellets according to the protocol. Run one gel with Mdh and Rfp as control and a second gel with Hps, Phi and Mdh as control. The SDS-PAGE with Mdh and RFP as control has to be done on Friday.
15-08-06
Main culture of the Rfp control (BYS8). OD at 10.45 is 0.3. OD at 11:30 is 0.788. Take 2 2 ml samples at 17:15 and freeze the pellet.
Load SDS gel (15 %) with the 6 h-samples of Mdh (#3PVM#), Phi (#1MDN#) and Hps (#KL96#). Gel runs at 120 V for 90 minutes. Expected Mdh 40 kDa; Phi 20 kDa & Hps 22.5 kDa. All samples are negative.
Take 22h samples for back-ups and freeze them.
Prepare two more SDS gels (12 % for Mdh and Rfp tomorrow and one 15 % as backup for Hps,Phi & Mdh)
15-08-07
Prepare suspensions with OD 0.13 of the samples (6 and 22 hours)
Do SDS-PAGE Mdh and Rfp with 12 % acrylamid.
Hps, Phi & Mdh with 15 % acrylamid. Results can be found in SDS-Gels 15-08-07.
Gel with Hps, Phi & Mdh is completely negative.
Gel with Mdh & Rfp has a very strong band in the Rfp 6 h Sample slightly abouve 26 kDa but Rfp has 25 kDa.

Do 50 ml mainculture of A30 constructs (injected with 2 ml overnight culture) in LB media with ampicilin. Incubation started at 10:07. Induce with 60 µl 1000x stock IPTG at 12:15 (OD600 of samples: #IGEM# 0.79; #4P9H# 0.758; #TFE1# 0.871; #ONK4# 0.640; #6DA3# 0.310).
After 6 h (18:15) take 2x2 ml samples of each cultivation and again next morning.

Take 2x2 ml (21 h) samples of mainculture.
make two 15 % SDS-Gels.
