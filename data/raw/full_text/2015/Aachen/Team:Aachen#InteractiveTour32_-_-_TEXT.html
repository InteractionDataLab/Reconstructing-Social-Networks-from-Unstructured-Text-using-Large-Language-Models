The Future
The Bioreactor
Biological experiments often are very costly. Therefore it would be a huge benefit to do them in small scale. But where do we get equipment for such experiments?
So we decided to build a small scale bioreacor system ourselfs that fits with all common requirements on bioreactors. For the first step we designed pumps and stirrers to supply our cultures with medium and oxigen.
Pumps in motion
The pumps can pump between 0.5 ml/h and 20 ml/min
