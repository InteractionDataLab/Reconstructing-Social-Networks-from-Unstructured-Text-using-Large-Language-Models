Synthetic Biology - Opportunities for interdisciplinary Research from Biology to Engineering
In June, we attended an interdisciplinary symposium were we presented our project to a broad spectrum of scientists. The following discussions lead to a huge amount of feedback on our molecular and bioreactor design.
Furthermore, we recorded several interviews with speakers as well as guests of the symposium, including the keynote speaker Jay Keasling . Apart from project related questions, we mainly asked them about their opinion on open science in the context of education and the growing European Community Lab scene. Below you will find representative clips of the mentioned interviews:
Dr. Jay Keasling - "How can interdisciplinary projects promote open discussions?"
Thanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!
Dr. Jay Keasling - "What are the chances and challenge of synthetic biology?"
Thanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!
Dr. Jan Marienhagen - "What is currently the most promising approach in the search for a sustainable carbon source?"
Thanks a lot to Wisam Zureik for recording and processing the video material!
