“
I just feel, if people are learning and understand the technology, that maybe it'll be less scary to the general public

Fascination has no age
Team picture Maker Faire 2015
To gather some feedback on our prototyped DIY bioreactor, we followed the example of iGEM Team Aachen 2014 and exhibited at the Maker Faire. With more than 5500 visitors each day, the discussions, feedback and interest in DIY biology was overwhelming. Besides new ideas for our bioreactor, the experiences lay the cornerstone for our human practices approach. Inspired by the german Community Lab "Technik Garage", we started digging deeper into the society of DIY biology.
Thank you, Stratum Braunschweig!
Thousands of interested visitors, thousands of interesting discussions
No, this is not posed!
