The Future
Before we began with actual wetlab work, we accomplished various things in advance: We discussed lab organization methods and decided on tubefront and our MediaWiki for documentation infrastructure. For several weeks, in-depth literature research and modeling was done to plan the upcoming lab work, which was then started in late april. The first subproject we approached in the lab was the Promoter Library. After all essential primers and gBlocks were designed and delivered, the cloning for methanol and glycogen subgroups got started as well.
Within our project, we modularized our work into several subtopics in order to reach all milestones:
Promoter Library
Bioreactor
Glycogen
Methanol
Modeling
Wetlab Documentation
Protocols
How did we do wetlab work? Protocols and methods are summarized under Protocols and Documentation gives an overview on all pages where detailed wetlab documentation is available. Finally, safety was a constant priority of ours as we planned to work with methanol.
