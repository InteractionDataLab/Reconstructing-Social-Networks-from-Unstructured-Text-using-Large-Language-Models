glgXP double knockout and glgX single knockout in BL21
The primer SNYO binds specifically on the iGEM Aachen MultiSTOP and therefore indicates the insertion of this fragment. All double knockout candidates look good, but only #1 of the double knockout candidates has the correct length.
glgXP double knockout and glgX single knockout in BL21
The primer 6V6P binds in the genomic area, so this is a control beacuse a band is present whether the gene is disrupted or not.

we did not pick single colonies from LB- plate, so we repeat curing
three single colonies from each LB- plate (#3RZ1#, #ZPKP#, #PH3R# and #XHEK#) are picked and streaked on LB- and LB+K
none of the BL21 glgXP double knockouts worked!

Curing:
#ZPKP# -> all three clones were cured
#XHEK# -> only the first clone was cured
#3RZ1# and #PH3R#-> curing did not work for any clone
make overnights of the cured clones LB-
for #3RZ1# and #PH3R#: pick 6 more colonies and test them on LB+K (also plate on LB-)
double knockout did not work again!
we will test if our electrocompetent BL21 (DE3) ΔglgP still have the pCas by plating them on LB+K (30 °C)
