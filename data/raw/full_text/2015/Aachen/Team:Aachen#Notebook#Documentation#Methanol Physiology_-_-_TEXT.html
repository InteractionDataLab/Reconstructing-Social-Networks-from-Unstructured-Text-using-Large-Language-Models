First we examined the growth performance of #IGEM# (gene mdh in pSB1A30, T7 promoter!)
Prepare M9+Amp plates.
Plate #IGEM# & #6DA3# on M9+A plates.
Do LB overnight cultures of #IGEM# & #6DA3#.
Order 2 flowerplates with seal foil from Juelich.
15-08-12
Goal
make a nice growth curve
establish the procedure
Inoculation (make sure that cultures are comparable)
spin down 4 ml of overnight culture into one 2 ml tube
resuspend in 500 µl of sterile medium
measure the OD in a 1:10 dilution
add medium to adjust the OD to 5
in 50 ml falcons, prepare LB+A+MeOH+IPTG
1.5 mM IPTG (150 µl stock)
120 mM methanol (243 µl => 0,486 %vol; => 120 mM (like in Juelich-paper))
inoculate 50 ml medium with 0.5 ml of cells at OD=5
Cultivation
incubate the culture in shake flasks, V_R=500 ml, V_L=50 ml, T=37 °C, n=250 rpm

Take wellplate from biolector (BioVT) in the evening, seal it and freez it. no expected growth curve
The wellplate got discarded on the 22nd of August because we already got better samples for MeOH quantification via HPLC.

Growth of control and AP19.POLY on M9 with 1.25 M methanol (Shake flasks experiment)
Precultures (Overdays): In the morning, two 5 ml M9+K+40mM glucose cultures were inoculated with 100 µl LB overnight cultures of pSB1KRDP (#RP1O#) and AP19.POLY in pSB1KRDP (#AW9K#).
Carbon-limited M9 medium with methanol was prepared (8mM glucose, 1.25 M methanol).
In the evening, the cultures were centrifuged down and resuspended in 500 µl of fresh medium. OD was measured in  100x dilution and medium was added to adjust both to an OD of 3.75. Two shake flask cultures were prepared and inoculated with 1 ml to an initial OD of 0.15 (VR=250 ml, VL=25 ml, n=250 rpm, T=37 °C).
15-08-21
Growth of Control, Mdh expression plasmid and AP19.POLY on LB with 1.25 M methanol (Shake flasks experiment)
Used clones are control #RP1O#, "Mdh expression" #IGEM# & AP19.Poly #AW9K#. (#IGEM# has a T7 promoter and AmpR)
The overnight cultures were centrifuged down and resuspended in 500 µl of fresh medium.  The OD was measured in a 100x dilution and medium was added to adjust to an OD of 3.75. Three shake flask cultures were prepared (Antibiotic and IPTG ones) and inoculated with 1 ml to an initial OD of 0.15 (VR=250 ml, VL=25 ml, n=250 rpm, T=37 °C).
next day: HPLC samples were taken to figure out the end concentration of MeOH in the media.

The Biolector experiment was stopped after 22 h and all wells were prepared for HPLC analytics (Sample Nr. D8,E8,F8 & F5, F6, F7 & B5, B6, B7 & D5, D6, D7 for triplicates are already in HPLC; rest is freezed).
3 samples of the LB media with MeOH shake flask experiment were also analysed by HPLC.
Some wells are also prepared for SDS-PAGE for the proof of protein expression.

Shake flask experiment (2. of the day + night)
Grow polycistronic clone #AW9K# in LB media with different MeOH concentrations (0 M; 1,25 M; 1,6 M).
TO DO
repeat SDS gel of shake flask experiment samples (15-08-22)
SDS gel of Biolector experiment samples (15-08-22)
make plates and overday cultures of #IGEM#, #RP1O# and #AW9K# for further experiments

15-08-24
continue shake flash experiment 2 from last night
three cultures are grown until stationary phase. We used 20 ml of these cultures to restart the cultivation in new flasks. We added methanol and water to an end concentration of 1,25 M MeOH.
Expected results: If the culture in flask 1 and 2 start to grow again it is proofed that E.coli uses Methanol as a carbon source.
Layout:

24 ml LB+K added to old shake flask No.3 from last night experiment (which was 1.25 M MeOH before) #AW9K# is the cultivated clone. 2 ml MeOH are added (8.3 vol %; 2.0571 M MeOH).
start OD is 0.382 (at 15:15)
10:50 => Triplett OD 0.59; 0.54; 0.60.
17:45 => Triplett OD 0.77; 0.73; 0.66 & not diluted 0.515.
