There was not enough Polymerase for all of the mastermixes, so Phi, Hps, Xpk1 and Xpk2 are in the freezer (falcon #CBPQ#)
Gel electrophoresis (2log ladder) with Mdh amplification products, PCR tube with Mdh2 is in falcon #8K9Q#
No PCR product on gel for Mdh2 - The amplification of Mdh2 will be repeated with the other gBlocks tomorrow, when there's enough Polymerase again

do CPEC again tomorrow

colony PCR of the four transformants of xpk from 15-06-04 + gel picture: none has expected lenght
CPEC of #XPK1# and #XPK2# in #6WCN#
do CPEC not with PCR amplified gBlocks but with pure gBlocks, reduces risk of mutations in the long coding sequence

Can we trust the gel picture? Or should we do a CPEC to clone the mdh gBlock into pSB1C3 again? (linear pSB1C3 in #6WCN#)
Jonas:"I think we should do a CPEC today, just to be sure to have a backup to proceed with on wednesday. If sequencing does not give valid results on wednesday, we can do a colony PCR of the new clones and purify plasmid of the colony PCR validated clones."
