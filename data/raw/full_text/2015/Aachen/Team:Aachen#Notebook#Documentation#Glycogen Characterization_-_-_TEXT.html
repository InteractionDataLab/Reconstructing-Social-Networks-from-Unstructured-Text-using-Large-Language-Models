ΔglgX + glgC and ΔglgP + glgC growth experiment
M9 cryo cultures #QRYS# and #TY1V#
inoculated main cultures (50 ml) to OD 0.2 at 8:30 am
for every sample: OD, pellet with 109 cells and supernatant for HPLC
ΔglgX + glgC and ΔglgP + glgC growth experiment
Taking into account different OD starting points, it was observed that ΔglgP + glgC grew to an OD of 5, equally as the wild type. ΔglgX + glgC grew faster but only to an OD of 3.8.
15-08-19
test for rapid determination of glucose and nitrogen
glucose was not depleted in stationary phase (approximately 35-55 mmol)
nitrogen was not depleted in the stationary phase
new M9 medium will contain less nitrogen
growth curve shows that BL21 ΔglgX has a shorter lag phase than the control and dies earlier
taking into account the different starting OD, ΔglgP and the wild type grow equally
made 5 ml LB cultures of Bl21 ΔglgX, BL21 ΔglgP and BL21 WT at 1 pm
inocultated an 10 ml M9 preculture at 6 pm
15-08-20
growth experiment with BL21 ΔglgX, BL21 ΔglgP and BL21 WT
inoculated with OD 0.5
took OD samples, samples for glycogen quantification and HPLC
cultures stopped growing at OD 1
test showed that nitrogen was depleted after 9 hours and growth curve indicates that it had already been depleted earlier
for future experiment, the amount of nitrogen in M9 will be raised
15-08-21
made 5 ml LB cultures 11:30 am
inoculated 10 ml M9 precultures at 6 pm
M9 medium now contains 6.6 mM nitrogen ans 40 mM glucose
15-08-22
inoculated 25 ml main culture at 9:30 am (wild type, ΔglgX + glgC, ΔglgP + glgC)
measured OD with Aquila Biolabs "Cell Growth Quantifier" (CGQ)
ΔglgX + glgC and ΔglgP + glgC growth experiment online
This growth curve resulted from an online OD measurement with Aquila Biolabs "Cell Growth Quantifier"(CGQ). We observed that ΔglgX and ΔglgP showed the same growth behavior as in the previous experiment where the OD was measured manually. ΔglgX has a shorter lag phase but dies earlier at a lower OD than the wild type and ΔglgP.
purified glycogen samples from this experiment: #Z19V# and #BV1E#
15-08-23
used protocol for glycogen extraction from the glycogen kit to analyze cultures wild type and ΔglgX + glgC in pSB1A30

25 ml M9 main cultures inoculated to OD 0.2
measured OD with Aquila Biolabs online measurement tool
ΔglgX and ΔglgP growth experiment online
Testing the growth of the single knockouts only showed that ΔglgX and ΔglgP had an identical growth behavior compared to the combination of each knockout with glgC. ΔglgP and the wild type grow very similarly while ΔglgX dies earlier. Aquila Biolabs CGQ was used for online measurement
iodine staining of cell pellets from first growth experiment (15-08-18; CDW approximately 0.4 mg)
we used modiefied version of Lugol's iodine (5 mM I2 and 5 mM KI in water)
ΔglgP + glgC is stained more than the WT
acid hydrolysis of WT and ΔglgX + glgC samples from 15-08-22
made M9 overnight cultures of BL21 Gold to test the pre-extraction with glycogen kit
15-08-29
glycogen extraction of BL21 WT, BL21 ΔglgX, BL21 ΔglgP
used 21 ml of (adjusted to an OD of ~2.4)
iMH and iMB exceeded the protocol and centrifuged one more time, resuspended the pellet in water, centrifuged again and used the supernatant
the cell pellet was also stored
glyocogen extraction of two BL21 WT overnights to test the purification protocol
used 4 ml of OD 1.83
for acid hydrolysis: evaporation of HCl under the hood at 85 °C
5 ml LB precultures of BL21 WT, BL21 ΔglgX + glgC and BL21 ΔglgP + glgC
these cultures are inculated again to purify glycogen with samples that are adjusted to the same OD
samples will be purified, crude glycogen dissolved in water and centrifuged
supernatant will be used for acid hydrolysis
glucose then quantified with glycogen assay kit and HPLC
15-08-30
evaporation of ethanol and water in vacuum centrifuge for both WT samples
for samples of iMB/ iMH, water samples were adjusted to pH 3
then ethanol was added to the sample
the pellet with cell material were dissolved in water and  adjusted to pH 3
ethanol was also added to these samples
glycogen samples of acid hydrolysis (Bl21 WT, BL21 ΔglgX + glgC from 15-08-22) were quantified with the glycogen kit
attention: samples were not adjusted to the same OD
glucose rapid determination showed that there is no glucose in the BL21 ΔglgX + glgC sample!!!

15-08-31
precultures of #CL6W#, #WHPX# and #ZEYD# (from LB- plate), plate #BXR1# (ΔglgP is in Bio6) on LB-
do iodine staining with samples from yesterday (from different growth phases)
result: most glycogen is accumulated in the stationary phase
iodine staining with overday cultures (GlgA, GlgB, GlgC)
adjust all to the same OD and resuspend in 50 µL of iodine solution
result: all three samples (glgA, glgB and glgC) were darker than the wildtype, glgC was the darkest
with M9 culture of wild type:
centrifuge the whole culture down in a 15 ml falcon
resuspend in 5 ml NaCl (0.9 %) solution
do a dilution series
Centrifuge down
stain with idodine solution
pipette in well plate and measure absorbance
with overday cultures of WT, glgA, glgB, glgC:

use 4 ml of this culture and calculate how much of other cultures do you need for equal cell number
centrifuge cultures for 2 minutes
discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 300 µl iodine solution
plate BL21 Gold (DE3) WT, ΔglgX and ΔglgP on M9 and on LB- plates
to repeat absorbance measuremen: new 10 mL M9 overnights of Bl21 Gold (DE3) WT and ΔglgX (6.6 mM N)
compare wild type to ΔglgX, because ΔglgX strain is expected to have no glycogen-> detect absorbance of iodine stained glycogen
5 mL LB overnights of NEB10β WT, ΔglgX, ΔglgP and ΔglgXP, on both normal LB and LB+40mM Glucose
new overnight of glgC in pSB1A30 to make a new cryo culture, because the old one did not grow so well

hydrolize cell pellet in 500ul HCl
prepare Glucose standard and samples for HPLC (sunday)
Iodine staining
prepare glucose standard (0.05 µg - 2 µg) no staining: the "glycogen standard" is most likely only glucose so it cannt be stained with iodine
adjust samples to same OD and do staining
M9: WT, ΔglgP, glgB, glgA
LB: WT, glgA, ΔglgP
Iodine staining  ΔglgP vs. wild type

the stained samples were heated for 10 minutes at 90 °C
the heated samples were cooled down in a 25 °C heater
samples were analyzed in plate reader at 540 nm
15-09-09
sequencing did not work
do iodine staining with frozen pellets and GlgC
the pellets were first solved in 50 ul water
Iodine staining  glgCAB vs. wild type vs. glgC
Cultivated in LB+20mM glucose, BL21 Gold + glgCAB and BL21 + glgC stained distinctly darker than the wild type. It can be observed that  GlgC is more blue which indicates more linear glycogen. GlgCAB #1 is very dark, brownish which suggests a higher frequency of branches. This could result from the influence of the branching enzyme.
iodine staining calibration
prepare 50 µl glycogen solutions with 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 g/l concentrations

glycogen purification via KOH extraction
use 25 ml LB + 20 mM glucose cultures with BL21 glgCAB #1, WT, ΔglgP, ΔglgX glgA and glgC
for hydrolysis (for HPLC): do triplicates!
Dinitrosalicylic acid staining (OD of glg A, glg B, glg C, Wildtype, and ΔglgX were adjusted to the OD of ΔglgP = 2.57)
blank: 1:1 dilution of dinitrosalicylic acid in 0.4 M NaOH
feed glycogen-producing cells to WT
inoculated 2 BL21 wild type LB precultures  (5 ml LB) at 1:20 pm
inoculate two 10 ml M9 cultures of WT over night
inoculate one 10 ml LB + 20 mM glucose overnight culture of WT and one of glgCAB
induction of glgCAB after 2.5 h
result: no difference in growth could be observed. The hypothesis is: because glycogen degradation enzymes are not secreted, glycogen in the medium does not give cells an advantage in growth when grown on C-limited medium
15-09-12
feed glycogen-producing cells to WT
inoculated main cultures to an OD of 0.2 at 10:40 am
three 25 ml M9 C-limited cultures of WT

OD at 11:57 am (for calibration): 0.312 (WT1), 0.306 (WT2), 0.308 (WT3)
measurement was accidently interrupted
new start OD: 0.357 (WT1), 0.345 (WT2), 0.348 (WT3)
fed at 5 pm with 500 µl
adjust LB  WT and the CAB cultures to same OD
centrifuge, resolve in 500 µl water and boil for 10 minutes at 95 °C
WT 1: fed with WT
WT 2: fed with glgCAB
WT 3: fed with water
no difference could be observed
the cells do not secrete the glycogen degradation enzymes
boiling might not have disrupted the glycogen chains, therefore, cells might not be able to metabolize the feed
experiment should work if the feed is treated with HCl for acid hydrolysis first

glgCAB in ∆glgP BL21 Gold (DE3) clone #4 was stained darker than the ∆glgP BL21 Gold (DE3) culture
therefore, the combination of the knockoutof glgP and the overexpression of glgCAB leads to higher glycogen production
for glgAB, no remarkably darker color was observed
Iodine staining BL21 Gold (DE3) ΔglgP + glgCAB vs. BL21 Gold (DE3) ΔglgP
Cultivated in LB+20mM glucose, BL21 Gold (DE3) ΔglgP + glgCAB stained distinctly darker than BL21 Gold (DE3) ΔglgP. It shows that even higher glycogen accumulation can be achieved by combining overexpression of all three synthesis enzymes and the ΔglgP knockout.
do 10 ml LB + 20 mM glucose + IPTG  of BL21 Gold (DE3) glgA, glgB, glgC, glgCAB, ∆glgP, ∆glgX, ∆glgP + glgCAB
Dinitrosalicylic acid staining
dried pellets of the replicates of glg B and wild type were resuspended in 1 mL water
samples were splited into two 500 µL samples
staining protocol was executed with one 500 µL sample of each replicate
the other 500 µL sample was treated with the acid hydrolysis protocoll
