We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements. 
</P><P>
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
</P><H4>References</H4><P>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.</P><H4>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H4><P>Chinese sacbrood virus (CSBV), one of the strains of the sacbrood virus (SBV), causes death of larvae of the Chinese honeybee (Apis cerana cerana) by forming a sac-like shape, resulting in failure of pupation. CSBV is one of the main causes of the significant decrease of Chinese honeybee populations in the past 40 years. So far, no effective control method exists for this bee disease, besides the prevention strategy, the only one beekeepers adopting currently.</P><P>FAFU-China team aims to investigate the possibility of controlling this disease through silence of CSBVâ€™s RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene by using RNA-interference technology. Basicly, we try to clone the RdRp gene into plasmid L4440, and then transform the brewer yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) with the modified plasmid. Due to lack of T7 RNA polymerase, the brewer yeast cannot identify the T7 promoter, which is exactly the promoter of RdRp gene fragment in L4440, Therefore, another challenge task for us is to recombine the plasmid PYES2 with the T7 RNA polymerase gene fragment, and then similarly transform the brewer yeast.</P><P>When bees feed with honey containing the recombinant plasmid, the second stage of the treatment starts. With the plasmid PYES2, the yeast is able to replicate the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which nevertheless are soon cut into pieces by the dicer, also known as endoribonuclease. After being cut by the dicer, the dsRNA become siRNA (Small interfering RNA), which cause silence of RdRp gene.</P><H4>Inspiration</H4><P>See how other teams have described and presented their projects: </P><UL><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial/Project"> Imperial</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project_Overview"> UC Davis</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Overview">SYSU Software</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
