Because of the narrow schedule, Ruicheng and Junhao tried their best to apply fund supports from the College of Plant Protection and other administrative departments of Fujian Agriculture University (FAFU). And we are very grateful to receive the first fund support ($4000) to register the FAFU-CHINA team, which approved by FAFU vice-president, professor Wenxiong Lin. Meanwhile, we are very thankful to get help from Ms. Xiuhui Li, the vice-director of Office of Educational Administration. What’s more, our English teacher Penny offered potential help during our registration of the team. Without their help, our iGEM team would still be a plan.</DIV><DIV>After the establishment of team, Prof. Zujian Wu helped us with the experiment plan. Besides, Prof. Wu tried to help us get fund and academic help. He recommended Prof. Xiaolei Huang to be a co-instructor of the team. Prof. Huang helped to establish our team by his abundant teamwork experience. Meanwhile, he supervised the whole process of our project and helped us finish each part before deadlines. During the project, Prof. Bingfeng Zhou and Prof. Taiyun Wei offered necessary biology materials, respectively, including bees, honey, and virus. Without their help in academic and organization, we would not be able to complete our project on time. </DIV><DIV>Our team members are with different abilities and backgrounds, which is good to our project. Changlong Lu and Ruicheng Dai completed the experiments. As seniors, they often introduced advanced biological technologies to other freshmen team members. Zhili Lai joined FAFU-CHINA team because of the publicity from Junhao Lu. </DIV><DIV>Lai has strong abilities to solve kinds of problems. Besides experiments, he was mainly responsible for presentation and outreach of our work. Liangdi Chen contributed a lot in designing the logo of our team, posters and wiki. Meanwhile, Tong Tong, Mucheng Cai, Zirui Chen, Yifan Tang, Tengzhou Huang, Mengnan Li provided their contribution in several tasks, such as publicity, interview, human practice and so on.</DIV><DIV id="tablew"><TABLE width="100%" height="100%" border="2" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#000000"><TBODY><TR><TH><P>Ruicheng Dai</P><P>Changlong Lu</P><P>Tong Tong</P></TH><TH><UL><P id="top1">Experiments design</P><P>Purification of CSBV</P><P>Cloning of RdRp gene</P><P>Expression in HT115</P><P>Organization</P><P>Data analysis</P><P>Publicity design</P></UL></TH></TR><TR><TH><P>Liangdi Chen</P><P>Tengzhou Huang</P><P>Zirui Chen</P><P>Yifan Tang</P><P>Mengnan Li</P></TH><TH><UL><P>Wiki design</P><P>Poster design</P><P>Souvenir design</P><P>Logo design</P><P>Interview</P><P>Safety</P><P>Notebook</P><P>Human Practice</P></UL></TH></TR><TR><TH><P>Junhao Lu</P><P>Zhili Lai</P><P>Mucheng cai</P></TH><TH><UL><P id="top1">Observing bees</P><P>Organization</P><P>Seeking support</P><P>Presentation</P><P>Human Practice</P><P>Publicity design</P></UL></TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
