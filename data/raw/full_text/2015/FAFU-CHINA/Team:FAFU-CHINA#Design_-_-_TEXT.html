The design of production
To meet the need of beekeepers,an easily understanding method of usage is necessary. So we design the following method to put our engineered bacteria into application,and make it a complete production.
Take 6g glucose, 6g fructose and 1g yeast extract, and then suspend them in 50ml distilled water. Now we have the easiest forage for honeybees. Next add 5ml bacterial suspension of engineered bacteria into the forage, limiting the density under 1CFU/ml, which is within the standard of food security.Then you have the complete product.
Beekeepers who don't know anything about synthetic biology can use this product simply by directly feeding infected hives with the product. This is the easiest way we design for the usage of our product.
