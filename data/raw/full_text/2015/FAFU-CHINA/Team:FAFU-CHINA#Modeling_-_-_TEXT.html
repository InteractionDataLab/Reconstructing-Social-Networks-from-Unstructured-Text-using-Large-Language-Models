Remark: Team SCUT help us with some of our modeling work.
In FAFU’s project, it   is difficult to measure the quantitative data and determine the   amount of dsRNAs which is fed to the larvae. So in the modeling   part, we devoted to establishing an accurate mathematical model to   simulate the dsRNA expression according to the mechanism of T7   promoter. After the model is built, we can determine the   relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production   of dsRNA . Then we can control  the amount of dsRNAs which if fed   to the larvae by controlling the concentration of IPTG   easily.
We know that T7 promoter   is a kind of inducible promoter. Hill equation can be used to   simulate the effect of T7 promoter. In T7 strength model, the   independent variable is the concentration of IPTG, and the   dependent variable is the production of dsRNA.
1.The Model Simulating the   Change of dsRNA with Time in Different Concentration of   IPTG
By observing the pattern   of the data, we figure out that the Logistic equation, which is   often used to simulate the growth of population, can model the   trend best. Thus, we adapt the formula
in the following fitting, where a is the   concentration of dsRNA in the steady state.
When the concentration of IPTG=0.3mmol/L, the   result of curve fitting is:
General model:
Coefficients (with 95%   confidence bounds):
a = 0.3241 (0.299,   0.3492)
b = 35.95 (-79.99,   151.9)
c = 1.829 (0.3231,   3.334)
Goodness of fit:
SSE: 0.00333
R-square:   0.9676
Adjusted R-square:   0.9567
RMSE: 0.02356

When the concentration of IPTG=0.4mmol/L, the   result of curve fitting is:
General model:

a = 0.3474 (0.3261,   0.3686)
b = 46.66 (-63.55,   156.9)
c = 1.828 (0.7647,   2.892)

a = 0.3465 (0.3206,   0.3723)
b = 49.63 (-79.79, 179)
c = 1.76 (0.6333,   2.886)

2.The Hill Equation
By the work of first   part, it is found that the concentration of dsRNA will become   steady after around 4 hours, so we regard the concentration of   dsRNA after 4 hours’ culture as that of steady state. Then the   Hill equation is applied to model the relationship between the   concentration of IPTG and the production of dsRNA, the result of   curve fitting is: (where  is the maximal data we can get from the   data)
General model:
Coefficients (with 95%   confidence bounds):
Xm = 0.1265 (0.08411,   0.1689)
n = 2.239 (0.8187,   3.658)
Goodness of fit:
SSE: 0.003107
R-square:   0.9062
Adjusted R-square:   0.8828
RMSE: 0.02787
Figure 4: The curve is   matched by the formula mentioned above.
We sorted out data and   parameters and then beautified the graph.
Figure 5: It shows the   relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production   of dsRNA.
Figure 5 shows the   relationship between the concentration of IPTG and the production   of dsRNA. According to this mathematical model, we can work out   the accurate production of dsRNA which is fed to the larvae with   the concentration of IPTG which is put into the bacterial system   to induce T7 promoter.
