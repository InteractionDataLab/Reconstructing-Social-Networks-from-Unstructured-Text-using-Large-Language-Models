By taking this opportunity, we made communications with other teams.</DIV><DIV>NJU-China which is from M3 lab Nanjing University offered valuable advice about CRISPR and expression vector. Before we made a study of safety, we thought that E.Coli vector would bring potential safety problems. Therefore we planned to express dsRNA in saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meanwhile, we planned to integrate the target gene to genome to avoid the lose of plasmids. But Doctor.ChenXi pointed that efficiency of prokaryotic expression system was better than eukaryotic expressing system. And there would be several problems which we couldn’t predict, and because of it. We would not be able to complete the project in time.</DIV><DIV>After conversation, we had to face the question that what we should do in the future. Therefore we restudied the safety problems. Luckily, we found information that honey could restrain the growth of bacteria. Therefore we decided to choose HT115 as an expression vector. </DIV><DIV>Meanwhile, we visited Beijing Normal University after CCiC. BNU-China Team is a year-old team, they also met several problems about the establishment of the team. How to attract new team members has been becoming one of the most important things. In their views, we could hold academic lecture to attract students to join us. And holding science communication event would be a good choice for us to attract popularity. What’s more, we agreed that standard training and criterion would be essential for the construction of teams.</DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
