Plasmid Extraction
We use E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA Mini Kit I bought from OMEGA bio-tek company to
extract plasmids and the detail protocol is showed as bellow:
1. Isolate a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate, and inoculate a culture of 1- 5 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for ~12-16 hours at
37°C with vigorous shaking (~ 300 rpm).
2. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature
3. Decant or aspirate and discard the culture media.
4. Add 250 mL Solution I/RNase A. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix thoroughly.
5. Transfer suspension into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
6. Add 250 mL Solution II. Invert and gently rotate the tube several times to obtain a clear lysate. A 2-3 minute incubation may be necessary.(Avoid vigorous mixing)
7. Add 350 mL Solution III. Immediately invert several times until a flocculent white precipitate forms.
8. Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000 x g) for 10 minutes. A compact white pellet will form. Promptly proceed to the next step.
9. Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.
10. Transfer the cleared supernatant from Step 8 by CAREFULLY aspirating it into the HiBind DNA Mini Column. Be careful not to disturb the pellet and that no cellular debris is transferred to the HiBind DNA Mini Column.
11. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
12. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
13. Add 500 mL HB Buffer.
14. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
15. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
16. Add 700 mL DNA Wash Buffer.
17. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
18. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
19. Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.
20. Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
21. Add 30-100 μl Elution Buffer or sterile deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.
22. Let sit at room temperature for 1 minute.
23. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
24. Store DNA at -20°C.
Gel Extraction
We use E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit bought from OMEGA bio-tek company to recover our target fragments after AGE and the detail protocol is showed as bellow:
1. Perform agarose gel/ethidium bromide electrophoresis to fractionate DNA fragments. Any type or grade of agarose may be used. However, it is strongly recommended that fresh TAE buffer or TBE buffer be used as running buffer. Do not reuse running buffer as its pH will increase and reduce yields.
2. When adequate separation of bands has occurred, carefully excise the DNA fragment of interest using a wide, clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
3. Determine the appropriate volume of the gel slice by weighing it in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Assuming a density of 1 g/mL, the volume of gel is derived as follows: a gel slice of mass 0.3 g will have a volume of 0.3 mL.
4. Add 1 volume Binding Buffer (XP2).
5. Incubate at 60°C for 7 minutes or until the gel has completely melted. Vortex or shake the tube every 2-3 minutes.
6. Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column in a 2 mL Collection Tube.
7. Add no more than 700μl DNA/agarose solution from Step 5 to the HiBind? DNA Mini Column.
8. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.
9. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
10. Repeat Steps 7-9 until all of the sample has been transferred to the column.
11. Add 300 mL Binding Buffer (XP2).
12. Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥13,000 x g) for 1 minute at room temperature.
13. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
14. Add 700μl SPW Wash Buffer.
15. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute at room temperature.
16. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
17. Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column for 2 minutes at maximum speed to dry the column matrix.
18. Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
19. Add 30-50μl Elution Buffer or deionized water directly to the center of the column membrane.
20. Let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes.
