We report progresses of our project and discusses about the assignment what we will do next week. Our teammates are passionate for discussions and everyone shares documents they have read and what they have learned. Teammates ask questions about the papers shared. It usually take a long time to discuss questions related to our iGEM project. This activity drives us to read more literature and learn more knowledge.</P></DIV><DIV id="sub"><P>The advisers not only attend our meetings to listen our reports about experiment progresses, but also provide suggestions on the project. They may share research trends in their lab as well. Whatâ€™s more, sometimes they give a talk to introduce some experimentation which really light up our experiments.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
