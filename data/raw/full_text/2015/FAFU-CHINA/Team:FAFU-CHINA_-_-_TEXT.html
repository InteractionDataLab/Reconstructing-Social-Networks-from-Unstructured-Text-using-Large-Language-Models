Description:
To remove the barrier between science and normal people’s life, It is our responsibility to lead people into the wonderland of science. This is a lofty ideal, and thousands of people in many fields have already been working for it for years. But this time, we need some innovations, perhaps some funs too.
Play is not only a simple process. We believe that play is actually a way of being, a way of learning, a way of doing science. So now If u ever watched the TED of Beau Lotto .  You’ll know that play provides everything you need in oder to be a scientist, and that is what motivates us. If we add rules to play, we have a game which is actually what project is. And who can be better than children to play? Then we tried to spread the idea that everyone has the potential to be scientist as long as being offered an opportunity. Instead of giving a dull lesson about biology, this year FAFU-China decided to teach children how to play correctly, how to play with principles from science, and finally they will find their own way to science....
