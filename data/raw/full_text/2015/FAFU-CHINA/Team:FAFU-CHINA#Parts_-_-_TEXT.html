New Part
Part:BBa_K1864000
Part Name: CSBV-RdRP
Part type: Coding
Creator :Ruicheng Dai
Sequence :BBa_K1864000 Part-only sequence (876 bp)
Short Description:Our part is CSBV's RdRP,RdRP gene cloned into the L4440 vector,and transformed into E.coli strain HT115 to express dsRdRP.
Long Description: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),(RDR),or RNA replicase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. This is in contrast to a typical DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which catalyzes the transcription of RNA from a DNA template. CSBV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (CSBV-RdRp) is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of viruses with no DNA stage that have sense negative RNA.
Part:BBa_K1864001
Part Name: T7 RNA polymerase
Part type: Coding
Creator :Ruicheng Dai
Sequence :BBa_K1864001 Part-only sequence (2652 bp)
Short Description:T7 RNA Polymerase is an RNA polymerase from the T7 bacteriophage that catalyzes the formation of RNA in the 5'→ 3' direction.

Improvement
Part:BBa_K105026
Part Name: Gal1 promoter
Part type: Regulatory
Creator :Katja Karstens
Sequence :BBa_K105026 Part-only sequence (549 bp)
Short Description: Gal1 starts transcription in media containing galactose.
Long Description: One of the approaches frequently used in S. cerevisiae is employment of tightly regulated GAL1 that is repressed by glucose and induced bygalactose. In the absence of glucose, addition of galactose results in rapid induction of GAL driven genes.
