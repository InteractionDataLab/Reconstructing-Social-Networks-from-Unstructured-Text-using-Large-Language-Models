        Intracellular replication of CaMV may be strongly affected by the addition of CRISPR/Cas9 and in turn may influence viral spread. Therefore, it's crucial for us to accurately model the replication process to predict viral production over time. In this way, our model of replication will connect our work on <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Modeling/Cas9_Dyanmics">CRISPR/Cas9 Dynamics</A> with our agent-based modelling of <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Modeling/Intercellular_Spread">Intercellular Viral Spread</A>. The first goal of the model is to demonstrate the reduction of viral load over time due to CRISPR/Cas9 modification of ORFVI. This reduction in viral load will hopefully allow for plant defenses to effectively contain the virus before the onset of systemic infection.</DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="model-caption">Plant Cells</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><P>This leads to our second goal which is to integrate the intracellular replication and intercellular spread models to fully understand impact of CRISPR/Cas9.

        Finding and implementing accurate parameter values is crucial when trying to draw conclusions from a model. Our model contains nearly thirty parameters, each of which needed to be found to exactly reproduce the viral replication process <EM>in silico</EM>. Model dynamics may be drastically affected by our choice in parameters and this must be accounted for in our analysis. However, as with many models in systems biology our network suffers from the &quot;parameter problem&quot; described in chapter 1 of the book by Gunawardena  which arises from the complexity of biological processes and the difficulty in measuring parameter values.</P><P>A number of parameter values are the same as those used in an HBV model developed by Nakabayashi &amp; Sasaki . Parameters that have a reference in the &quot;Source&quot; column are ones we were able to find or derive accurate values for from the literature. Unfortunately, there are a few parameter values that could not be found (e.g. the half-saturation constant of P6 activation) and so we explicitly mention the absence of data in the table. In order to compensate for the lack of accurate parameters, we analyze our model over a wide range of parameters to determine how behaviour will be affected.</P><P> Lastly, for simplicity we normalized each concentration by the volume of the cell (volume=1.414x10$^{-13}$m$^3$).</P><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="paramTable"><H3 class="panel-title"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#biobackground" href="#collapseTable" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTable">

Again, this is because the virion concentration gradient changes along genome modification rate axis, not the RNA silencing axis.</P><UL><LI>When the maximum RNAi effectiveness is low (&lt; 6 x $10^{-4}$ $min^{-1}$), low virion numbers (0-10) occur when the genome modification rate is high (0.095 $min^{-1}$).  High virion numbers (60-70) occur when the genome modification rate is low (0.063 $min^{-1}$).  </LI><LI>When the maximum RNAi effectiveness is high (&gt; 6 x $10^{-4}$ $min^{-1}$), both the RNAi and the genome modification affect virion concentration.  For example, at a maximum RNAi effectiveness of 10 x $10^{-4}$ $min^{-1}$, a modification rate of only 0.05 $min^{-1}$ is necessary to reduce virion numbers to 0.</LI></UL><P>This serves as another confirmation that using a CRISPR system to reduce viral efficacy is a worthwhile endeavor, as CRISPR genome modification has a more significant impact on virion levels than the primary plant defense, gene silencing.  An ideal genome modification rate is ~0.095 $min^{-1}$, as this value is the threshold genome modification rate that decreases the virion numbers to 0 on both heat maps.</P><H3>Sensitivity Analysis: Effect of parameter values on steady-state</H3><P>Exploration of parameter values is crucial to determining how robust our system is, especially for parameters which we were unable to find values for. Below is a table showing the relative sensitivity of our system to each parameter at the value listed in the parameter table above. Note we omitted $f_u$, $k_p$, $k_a$, $\delta_3$, $\delta_4$, and $\delta_5$ since for each of those parameters the relative sensitivity was less than 0.01. $k_p$ and $k_a$ are two parameters from our parameter table that we were unable to find values for. The fact that the system is insensitive to changes in their values is good, it indicates our system is robust around these parameters. Biologically this is expected since $k_p$ and $k_a$ are mostly limited by the availability of substrates available for packaging and anchoring respectively.</P><P>We note that virion concentration at 16 hours is increased the most by increasing the transcription rate of 35S RNA. This is intuitive to us since this leads to more 35S RNA, which means more pregenomes to be packaged and more P3, P4, and P5 available to produce virions. We also see a significant increase from increasing the maximum number of genomes in the nucleus, transcription rates for P3, P4, P5, and P6, and the transcription rate of 19S RNA.</P><P>Virion concentration was also very sensitive to $k_g$ and $k_c$, our rates of P6 deactivation by CRISPR/Cas9. An increase in $k_g$ and $k_c$ effectiveness leads to a relatively larger decrease in virion concentrations. This is exciting since our application is focused around the implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Other parameters that will cause a large relative decrease in virion concentration are the maximum RNAi effectiveness ($L$) and the half-saturation constant for P6 activation.</P><H4>Relative Sensitivity at 16 hours</H4><TABLE class="table table-condensed"><THEAD><TR><TH>Parameter</TH><TH>Relative Sensitivity</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY><TR><TD>$\alpha_{35}$</TD><TD>$1.48$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$d_{max}$</TD><TD>$1.26$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\beta_3, \beta_4, \beta_5, \beta_6$</TD><TD>$1.06$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\beta_6$</TD><TD>$1.03$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\alpha_{19}$</TD><TD>$1.03$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\alpha_c$</TD><TD>$0.20$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$k_v$</TD><TD>$0.01$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$...$</TD><TD>$...$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\delta_v$</TD><TD>$-0.01$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$k$</TD><TD>$-0.05$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\gamma_d$</TD><TD>$-0.09$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\gamma_{19}$</TD><TD>$-0.14$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\gamma_{35}$</TD><TD>$-0.18$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$\delta_6$</TD><TD>$-0.34$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$v_e$</TD><TD>$-0.99$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$K_6$</TD><TD>$-1.03$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$L$</TD><TD>$-1.55$</TD></TR><TR><TD>$k_g, k_c$</TD><TD>$-1.74$</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3>Phase Plane Analysis: Effect of initial conditions on steady state</H3><P>We want to investigate how the total and relative concentrations of wild-type or $\Delta$-P6 virions will vary over time using different founder population compositions and varying the P6-deactivation rate. To investigate this we produced phase plane diagrams comparing the amount of wild-type virions in the cell against the amount of modified ones.</P><P>Below are three sections, each with a different $k_g$ and $k_c$, which show how the composition of virions in the cell will change over time with or without our CRISPR/Cas9 system. In each case, the lines are colour-coded by the initial concentration of virions. If the founder population is mostly wild-type the curve is dark blue, if founders are mostly mutants the curve will be green, and mixed populations will have a colour in between. Founder populations are varied from 0 to 10 genomes for each of the trajectories.</P><P>This analysis fits nicely with our viral spread model, as it will tell us how initial composition of founders will affect viral load. It also fits nicely with the CRISPR/Cas9 analysis as it shows how behaviour changes given different values for $k_g$ or $k_c$.</P><P><B>Note:</B> In each plot below âpure virionsâ refers to the number of virions in the cell which contain the wild-type genome while âimpure virionsâ refers to the number of virions containing the genome without functional P6.</P><H4>Phase plane with no P6 deactivation $k_g = k_c = 0$</H4><P>As shown in the four graphs below, phase planes with no P6-deactivation are not particularly interesting. Since there's no conversion from wild-type to modified genomes the lines are perfectly straight. Their slope is determined by the initial composition of wild-type and modified genomes while the final position after a given time are determined by the initial wild-type genomes (since only wild-type genomes produce P6).</P><P>After 4 hours there are no virions present in the cell which corresponds to the lag between initial infection and virion production. After 6 hours the cell begins to produce virions at fairly low concentrations. At 8 hours the cell produces slightly more. Finally, by 16 hours the number of virions has reached steady state, which is indicated by the regular line length. The lines do decrease in length as the slope increases since lines with a larger slope have more modified genomes which leads to less P6 and thus fewer total virions at steady state.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Phase diagram with $k_g$ = 0</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4>Phase plane with no P6 deactivation $k_g = k_c = 0.001$</H4><P>Much more interesting is when P6-deactivation is non-zero. At 6 hours there is a low amount of virions produced in the cell. At 16 hours we see most virion trajectories have reached steady state (seen in the graph by the top right limit), but these curves have another interesting property. Due to the conversion of wild-type virions the lines are curving upwards as there are more mutated genomes to produce them.</P><P>However, over time (seen clearly at about 48 hours) the total amount of virions curves back on itself. This is due to having all genomes having P6 deactivated and thus no transactivation from P6 to produce P3, P4, and P5. Once P6 has started degrading the concentrations of the other proteins decrease and so the total viral load lowers. After 80 hours we see that the total amount of virions will drop down to zero.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Phase diagram with $k_g$ = 0.001</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4>Phase plane with high P6 deactivation $k_g = k_c = 0.01$</H4><P>Here we see what happens when the P6-deactivation rate is high. Again, at 4 hours there are no virions present. At 8 hours there are virions present and again all the lines curve upwards due to the conversion of wild-type genomes to modified versions. Note also the âfeatheryâ pattens in the trajectories at 8 hours which are caused by the fact that we varied both wild-type and modified genomes from 0 to 10.</P><P>At 16 hours we see that with this high P6 deactivation rate the virions start to curve inwards much earlier than they did in the previous section. Finally, at 24 hours the viral load is in sharp decline due to the total lack of P6 in the cell.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Phase diagram with $k_g$ = 0.01</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION id="references" title="References"><H2>References</H2></SECTION></DIV><A href="#0" class="cd-top">Top</A><FOOTER><P class="footer-links" style="font-size:0.8em;"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Sitemap" style="font-size:1em;">Sitemap</A><A style="padding-right:0;font-size:1em;" href="http://igem.uwaterloo.ca">External Site</A>Â© 2015 Waterloo iGEM
