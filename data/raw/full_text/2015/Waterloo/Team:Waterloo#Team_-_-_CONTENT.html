Peivand loves learning, that’s all it matters to her.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Steven ten Holder</P></DT><DD><P class="description">As one of two wet lab leads, Steven contributed to early-stage design and helped train, manage, and troubleshoot the lab’s cloning and experimentation efforts. In addition to his enthusiasm for advancements in science and technology he finds time for skateboarding, piano, and entrepreneurship. His appeal for genetic engineering is best summarized by an old TED talk delivered by Gregory Stock: “A generation or so away… That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves. Now I don't mean extra gills or something -- something we care about, like aging.”</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Nadine Haymour</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Nadine, the Team Lead of the Policy and Practices team, helped with outreach events such as ESQ (Engineering Science Quest), and SHAD Valley. She is very interested in the ethics as well as commercialization of a produced lab product. With this interest she helped design and create a survey, and a scale-up document to explain how the lab’s product would be approved, sold, and utilized in the real world. During this, she helped a little bit in the lab for various small experiments when extra hands were needed. In her spare time she enjoys exploring new places, eating new foods and learning about very bizarre diseases and viruses, and the various methods of how to treat them.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Bill Lin</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Bill has been involved in writing some funding proposals and searching for conference housing in his first year on iGEM.

She has transformed bacterial cells, ran gels, and ligated constructs. Apeksha enjoys travelling and exploring new places when not in school or working.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Ayan A. Abukar</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Ayan’s 2015 iGEM journey began with her researching for the sgRNA swap component of the project. Soon enough she found herself pipetting PCR’s, ligating constructs and conducting transformations after the sun had set with her fingers crossed awaiting the next day’s results. Aside from devoting 73% of her life to the lab and referring to herself as the &quot;King of iGEM&quot; as often as possible; the remaining 27% of Ayan’s life is devoted to her pending writing career, pretending to be a photographer and just being an endless supply of sarcasm.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Erin Laidley</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Erin is the &quot;Queen of iGEM.&quot; Her primary contribution involved caring for the Arabidopsis plants (affectionately referred to as “her babies”) and preparing them for floral dips. Erin also occasionally pipetted and transformed things in the lab. When she isn’t in the greenhouse, Erin can be found with her nose in a book, playing the ukulele, or making a fool out of herself at Zumba classes. Her propensity for insightful commentary is renowned throughout the team and often misinterpreted as “sass.”</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Kate Beggs</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Kate is a student in psychology who somehow managed to do enough biology to be useful on the lab team. She has been helping with various smaller tasks involved in the construction of Cas9 and is also organizing the testing in protoplasts. In her spare time Kate likes playing music, talking about politics, and listening to reruns of the this American life podcast. That being said she is studying for MCATs this term so doesn't really have any time to spare.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Lauren Morse</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Lauren has contributed to the creation of the GFP/RFP Target plasmid and pco_Cas9 cloning.  She has been researching the structure of the Cas9 protein and the mutability of its base pairs in the design of an sgRNA swap system. Lauren is passionate about research in molecular biology and psychology, and volunteers as client support in a variety of organizations that offer counselling for mental illness, pregnancy options, and sexual health-related topics.  Her favourite movie is Cloud Atlas, and she loves finding the time on weekends to go out for a picnic and play tennis.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Patrick Diep</P></DT><DD><P class="description">As the co-op student for the summer, Patrick’s colloquially known job title is “Mitochondria.” He is the lab’s powerhouse who supplies the team with energy through his relentless effort to help lead the construction of the CRISPR/Cas9 immune system, and re-engineer the sgRNA scaffold. Whether he’s running advanced multiplexing protocols, or just cleaning the lab space, Patrick is in the lab from sunrise to sunset to ensure his team leads experience as little stress as possible. Outside of the lab, Patrick’s committed to promoting gender equity through WiSTEM, welcoming first-year students with Science Orientation, and helping develop a future stem cell storage service at CryoCapsule.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Peter Hoang</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Peter has mostly been involved in the diagnostics surrounding the pCAMBIA construct. Peter likes squash. Swag.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Samantha Hirniak</P></DT><DD><P class="description">This is Sam's third year as a part of the Waterloo iGEM team. After spending two years doing only Mathematical Modelling for the team, she decided to venture into the lab to learn more about experimental design and protocols. Here she learned a lot about floral dips, design of genetic constructs, trouble shooting, transformation and other basic cloning techniques. She also remained involved with the Mathematical Modelling team on more of a consulting basis. She is extremely interested how we can use both mathematical theory, engineering design principles, and biological knowledge to solve problems in today's society.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Vivian Chan</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Vivian has been working on various parts of the overall project.

Although his major is statistics, he relished the opportunity iGEM offered to try problems which are, to him, very novel. He spent the majority of his time on the team working with the different subgroups responsible for modelling the action of CRISPR and Cas9. Within these groups he mostly took minutes. When he isn't busy working on things he needs to do, he likes to lift weights, read news articles, and hang out with friends.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Emily Watson</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Though Emily is an aged, cynical student (3rd year eng), this is her first year with iGEM.  It is quite refreshing.  Emily is on the Mathematical Modelling team as part of the Viral Assembly group - a group dedicated to demystifying and modelling the inner workings of CaMV infection.  Specifically, she's contributed to an intracellular network map, developing diffential equations and unearthing parameters. It has been quite a fun challenge to work on a problem with no concrete answer.  She would like to thank 'google.ca' for helping her with all the complicated biology words.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Isaac Ellmen</P></DT><DD><P class="description">In Isaac's first year on the team, he was primarily involved with modelling Cas9 cuts. He also dabbled in gRNA design, protein modelling, wiki design and pretty much anything he could get his hands on. This was Isaac's first introduction to (synthetic) biology and he thinks it is absurdly cool. Outside of iGEM, Isaac enjoys coding, acting, math and crying over The Leafs.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">John Drake</P></DT><DD><P class="description">John is in his third year working with iGEM. This year he primarily worked with the viral assembly subteam in trying to figure out how virions are put together in infected cells and how we can stop them. He also worked with the viral spread team to build an agent-based model of viral spread because ABMs are cool. His spare time is occupied by the internet.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Joyce Zhang</P></DT><DD><P class="description">This is Joyce's first year with iGEM and in university as a BioMed Eng. She is a part of the subteam which modelled and researched viral spread and plant defences. She enjoyed researching and poring over journal articles, as well as seeing ideas spring to life and building something from the ground up. Additionally, she was estatic at the opportunity to attempt to wrangle new programming languages for the sake of modelling things. In her spare time, she likes to draw and paint, contemplate the mysteries of the universe and play in orchestras.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Kevin Thai</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Kevin has spent two years on the iGEM Math Modelling team, which has only served to further his indecision about which of biology and computer science is more interesting. As part of his role as part of the Tridimensional Trifecta this year, he has spent countless hours searching for and reading through almost non-existant documentation, and putting together hacky scripts in PyRosetta to determine the suitability of Cas9 mutants. In his spare time he looks up obscure music, naps while drinking coffee, and wonders how he ever ended up with so many open tabs in Firefox.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Kim Nguyen</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Kim is a Biology Joint Math student and is currently 1/3 of the tri-dimensional trifecta. Her work for iGEM includes sifting through papers, helping pick out sgRNA targets, writing python scripts (while simultaneously figuring out how to python properly), and designing cas9 variants to be modelled in PyRosetta. Kim is also helping with the wiki design since she sold already sold her soul to web design for money. In her spare time she enjoys hanging out with dogs, biking places, cooking, eating dessert, and being facetious.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Laura Vaughan</P></DT><DD><P class="description">This is Laura's first year as a part of iGEM after gleefully being introduced to the team last winter. Part of the Viral Assembly subgroup, she contributed an amalgamated preliminary viral network map and a large amount of research on plant defenses on the cellular level, in addition to modeling equations in SymBiology and helping out with the wiki, visuals for the final presentation and miscellaneous tasks along the way. She enjoys spending her time learning as much as she can about synthetic biology with a side of physics, design and coding.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Mark Lubberts</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Mark is a biology student who's managed to escape from mechanical engineering. He's part of the Tridimensional Trifecta, and spent a lot of time trying to understand Cas9 structure, and getting PyRosetta/PyMOL set up on Windows. If he wasn't busy writing this bio he'd be looking into how to mutate Cas9 in PyRosetta as well. He helped with finding the different sgRNA targets, and also wrote a couple wiki pages. Puns cause him physical pain, though Tessa doesn't seem to mind. Because she's terrible. When not busy with iGEM he's working on his 499 project, because Lactobacillus is a cruel organism.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Robert Gooding-Townsend</P></DT><DD><P class="description">This is Robert’s first year on iGEM, though he has been drifting towards mathematical biology throughout his entire degree. He investigated viral spread within plants, which involved tracking developments in this evolutionary arms race, fawning over the few papers that have explicit equations, and coding agent-based models. Unfortunately, his plot to include secret agents was against iGEM policy. In the rest of his life, he enjoys science comedy, classical music, reading a bit too intensely, and being aggressively interdisciplinary.</P></DD><DT><P class="name">Zoë Humphries</P></DT><DD><P class="description">Zoë has enjoyed her first year with iGEM, where her time in the Viral Spread subteam has been interesting, thoroughly challenging, and eye-opening. She researched viral transport and plant defense mechanisms, which were infinitely more complex than she realised. Learning about python and agent-based modelling was confusing at first, and then kind of awesome. She hopes to help with western blotting and coordinating all the events. In other parts of her life, she enjoys playing clarinet, rock climbing, singing running, swing dancing, and listening to podcasts (helps her pretend she’s an adult). </P></DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="accordion-group contentContainer"><DIV class="accordion-heading cover" id="policy" title="Policy"><A class="accordion-toggle cover-text" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#collapsePolicy">
