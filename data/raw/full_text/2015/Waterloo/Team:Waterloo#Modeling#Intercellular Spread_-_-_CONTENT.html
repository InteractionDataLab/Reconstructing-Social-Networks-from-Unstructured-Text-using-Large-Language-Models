Although fewer built-in functions could be an advantage (adding more flexibility and customization to the simulation), time constraints and unfamiliarity with Java pushed us to use <A href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</A> instead of MASON. NetLogo was easy to learn, well-documented and had a built in GUI. These were essential for rapid prototyping -- while some other choices would have been better able to handle large simulations, they would have had much longer development time for small changes, ultimately impeding our efforts to make a quality model. </P></SECTION><SECTION id="results" title="Results"><H2>Results</H2></SECTION><H3>Normal -- no intervention</H3><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Agent-based Netlogo model shows the spread of infection (red) and acquired resistance (blue) in a leaf where each agent simulates an ODE replication model. Without CRISPR, one leaf is entirely overwhelmed.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
We were quite successful in making a reasonable representation of the normal process of viral spread. A typical model run proceeds as follows:</P><UL><LI>The virus quickly spreads to most of the initially infected lead, with only a small amount of resistance developing.</LI><LI>Once it has spread to this entire leaf, it spreads into the plant’s vascular system and the main stem.</LI><LI>Soon, all of the vascular structure is carrying the virus. But the infection runs its own course in each leaf.</LI><LI>In some cases, resistance builds up and seals off the point of initial infection. In others, the infection spreads into the leaf, but a sizable fraction of it becomes resistant.</LI><LI>Apoptosis occurs near the boundaries between infected and resistant regions, often cutting off these regions from the rest of the plant. </LI></UL><P>In a few cases, the plant is lucky &amp; the initial infection was small, so the infection did not spread beyond the first leaf. However, most simulation runs result in over half the plant being infected.</P><H3>CRISPR/Cas9 – our intervention</H3><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Agent-based Netlogo model shows the spread of infection (red) and acquired resistance (blue) in a leaf where each agent simulates an ODE replication model. The CRISPR effect parameter (t1/2) is captured in the ODE.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
When we introduce our CRISPR/Cas9 mechanism, and hold all other parameters constant, we see that the infection is stopped remarkably quickly. It rarely spreads into the vasculature. 
The level of resistance is correspondingly lower, since the plant detects less of a threat.</P><P>This effective prevention of viral spread is maintained even with moderate increases in other viral parameters and/or decrease in resistance.</P><SECTION id="discussion" title="Discussion"><H2>Discussion</H2><P>As with many projects in mathematical biology, one of the biggest challenges is finding accurate parameter values. Our slider-based approach was a creative solution that enables us to investigate the balance of different factors in viral spread and resistance, but it was quite arbitrary. Our results remain fundamentally qualitative – we can tell our intervention helps, but we can’t say by how much.</P><P>There are two main ways this could be improved. One is simply to more systematically explore this parameter space. Computationally, this would take a long time, since there are many variables with very large feasible ranges, but it is conceptually simple. However, there is a risk that this would not be particularly illuminating.</P><P>A better solution is to push for inventive experiments that can better determine these parameters. Tromas and colleagues make excellent use of flow cytometry to get this kind of data . This allows them to determine the infectivity of cells as a function of time. While this doesn’t quite give the probability per time of <EM>attempted</EM> spread events, it’s a very promising line of inquiry.</P><P>A different direction in which this model could be improved is having a more detailed and faithful plant architecture. There are many types of cells in plant leaves, for example, as well as multiple interconnectin plant defense mechanisms. There are also orders of magnitude more cells than we rendered. These changes would be needed to make our model more accurate; they would also entail running it on different software.</P></SECTION><SECTION id="references" title="References"><H2>References</H2></SECTION></DIV><A href="#0" class="cd-top">Top</A><FOOTER><P class="footer-links" style="font-size:0.8em;"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Sitemap" style="font-size:1em;">Sitemap</A><A style="padding-right:0;font-size:1em;" href="http://igem.uwaterloo.ca">External Site</A>© 2015 Waterloo iGEM
