Here we learned and improved our skills in cloning and manipulating biological materials. We also tried to apply our ideas from paper to the real world.

Here, amazing talks about biology, engineering and philosophy took place. And here we debated about science and lab topics.
To sum up, the office that you can see in the picture in the left has been our home this summer: the place where we built the project, but also where we built our team spirit.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="grey"><DIV class="jumbotron"><DIV class="container"><H1>Safety</H1><P class="lead text-muted">Lab and Project Safety</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><H2>Safety in our Lab</H2><P class="lead">Our lab is classified as Level 1 of biosafety.

The curli is natively produced by several safe strains, like the TOP10 used for transformations. Our strain contains a CsgA deletion and can only produce the curli when transformed with the designed plasmid and induced. This part of the project is based on sufficient scientific publications and previous iGEM information and parts. Also, one assay is designed to test the efficiency of the biofilm created carrying a specific affinity tag. For the assay teeth pieces were used, taking care of all the existing regulations and safety recommendations. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-11 col-xs-11"><P class="lead">The chassis organism used for our project is a modified strain of the lab organism <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> K-12.

This will be arranged following the lab regulations, and the tooth will be provided following all the existing regulations. We will handle the part in the ML1 lab, and using gloves while working with the part. Furthermore, the teeth are cleaned properly before the use. The use of that samples is regulated by the Ministry of Economic affairs, Agriculture and Innovation of the Government of The Netherlands. The waste of all animal byproduct is designated as Specific Animal Waste (following Euralcode 180102). Later on, it is transported to the ZAVIN in Dordrecht for its destruction. For further information, you could contact the Residual Management Department of TU Delft (ReststoffenBeheer@tudelft.nl)</P><P class="lead">One of the problems to be faced with this project is the production of csgA as biofilm-maker unit. It has been reported previously as a virulence factor from harmful strains of E.coli, because the amyloid make the attachment to surfaces easier. However, we implemented two safety points for minimizing the risk of plasmid transmission to pathogen strains. First of all, the gene which codifies for csgA is preceded by a Rhamnose promoter. That prevents curli (csgA+csgB polymer) to be produces when no inductor is applied to the system. Furthermore, as rhamnose is a metabolizable inductor the gene expression could be avoided just by stopping the rhamnose supply. On the other hand, we aim our project for product testing or industrial production. So, the good laboratory practices and good manufacturing practices in these two fields should avoid any safety issue.</P></DIV></DIV><P class="lead">If our project could be fully developed into a real product, it would aim the following fields:</P><DIV class="col-md-11 col-xs-11"><P class="lead" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Factories</P><P class="lead" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Lab applications</P><P class="lead" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Consumer products</P><P class="lead" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Test products to be used in the human body</P><P class="lead">Test products on food</P></DIV><P class="lead">We would like to encourage every interested iGEM team or researcher in general to contact us for further details about the safety in our lab and project!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="white"><DIV class="jumbotron"><DIV class="container"><H1>Day Notes</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="panel-group" id="accordion1" role="tablist" aria-multiselectable="true"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV id="collapse1procedures" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="heading1procedures"><DIV class="panel-body"><H1>InterLab Study – Measurement Award</H1><DIV class="panel-group" id="accordion1notes_interlab" role="tablist" aria-multiselectable="true"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading panel-title" role="tab" id="heading1interlab_june"><A class="collapsed" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1notes_interlab" href="#collapse1interlab_june" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse1interlab_june">

Consequently, we have carried out new experiments using ampicillin (AMP) plates later.</P><P class="lead">In the plate with LB and CAM, using the cells transformed with the GFP marker plasmid (I13504), we couldn’t see any colonies early in the morning (probably because we kept the plates at room temperature).
