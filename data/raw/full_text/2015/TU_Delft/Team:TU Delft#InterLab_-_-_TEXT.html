InterLab Study
The Second International InterLab Measurement Study in Synthetic Biology.
Among 81 other teams from all over the world, our team decided to participate in this year’s iGEM Interlab Study of 2015.
Results
For this study, three devices needed to be constructed consisting of a constitutive Anderson promoter with low (J23117), medium (J23106) and high (J23101) promoter strengths expressing GFP (I13504) as reporter. Using the Biobrick distribution, the       required promoters and GFP were cloned in E.coli top10 cells, restricted and ligated to afford the final devices. Fluorescence was measured from overnight cultures using FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) to compare the individual promoter       strengths in relative units.
To measure fluorescence, single cells were excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and emitted light was measured at 530 ± 30 nm and a total of 30’000 events were recorded for each sample. The data is presented in relative units of fluorescence on the x axis and fluorescent side scattering (cell size, a constant parameter) on the y axis. A shift to the right side thus corresponds to an increase in fluorescence.
In order to compare the three different promoters described above, a histogram showing the fluorescence intensity at 530 nm versus the number of cells is made (figure 1.). In the figure, it is clear how J23101 leads to a better GFP expression in average,       while J23106 and J23117 show a lower performance in that order.

Negative and positive control
Plasmids containing only the promoter without GFP were used as negative controls to calibrate the FACS machine. The Biobrick I20270 (containing J23151 as constitutive promoter, obtained from the distribution) was used as a positive control. x label: fluorescence                 (relative units); y label: FSC fluorescence side scattering (cell size)
×
High promoter strength
J23101_I13504 was grown in biological triplicate (hi clone 1,2,3) and was measured in technical triplicate (a,b,c). x label: fluorescence (relative units); y label: FSC fluorescence side scattering (cell size)
×
Medium promoter strength
J23106_I13504 was grown in biological triplicate (med clone 1,2,3) and was measured in technical triplicate (a,b,c). x label: fluorescence (relative units); y label: FSC fluorescence side scattering (cell size)
×
Low promoter strength
J23106_I13504 was grown in biological triplicate (low clone 1,2,3) and was measured in technical triplicate (a,b,c). x label: fluorescence; y label: FSC fluorescence side scattering (cell size)
×
To process our raw data, the relative fluorescence of the corresponding negative controls, which were cells containing the same promoter without GFP, was subtracted from the measured samples expressing GFP to obtain our final data in relative units.

As expected, high, medium and low levels of fluorescence were measured in accordance with the promoter strengths used in our constructs. The weak promoter (J23117) however was lower than expected with only approximately 15 relative units surpassing the negative controls. In contrast, the medium promoter (J23106) is approximately 70 times stronger than the weak promoter (J23117) and the high promoter (J23101) is approximately 170 times stronger than the weak one (J23117). Compared, the high promoter (J23101) is approximately 2.3 times stronger than the medium promoter (J23106).
Using FACS, we measured 30’000 single cells and recorded the fluorescence level in triplicate for each sample. Surprisingly, these data sets are still prone to large errors with a standard deviation of roughly 10%.
