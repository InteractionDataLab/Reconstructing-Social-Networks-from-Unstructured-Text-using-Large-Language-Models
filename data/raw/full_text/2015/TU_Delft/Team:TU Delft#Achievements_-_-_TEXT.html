iGEM Giant Jamboree
At the Giant Jamboree, our final efforts went into delivering excellent final presentation, poster presentations and demonstrations of the Biolinker. You can check our poster here and presentation here
The Giant Jamboree took place in Boston, USA. The TU Delft team and the Biolinker had an amazing adventure together, while working and visiting some of the most famous USA landmarks
Medal Requirements
Bronze:
√  Register for iGEM , have a great summer , and attend the Giant Jamboree.
√  Complete the Judging form.
√  Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts (if any) using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
√ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
√  Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others , including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
√  Develop a working prototype of an open-source hardware tool that supports synthetic biologists working with BioBrick standard biological parts. Document your tool on the project page on your team wiki.
Silver:
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
√  Provide a demonstration of your hardware using a video tutorial that explains all the features of the hardware operation. Make the video available on your wiki. You must also send the video file to iGEM HQ (email hq [at] igem [dot] org).
√  Document your device on your wiki with information and associated files sufficient for a future iGEM team to reproduce your work . You should include relevant design schematics, 3d print files (or other), software and a Bill of Materials (BOM).
√  iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
Gold:
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:
√  Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
√  Help any other iGEM team utilize the hardware developed by your team. You must clearly show how your hardware was used and the results that were obtained. Results should take the form of a written report from the team testing the hardware and be posted on both team's wikis.
√ Demonstrate your hardware at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. If your equipment is too large to transport, create an installation to demonstrate functionality. Note: you may not bring live biological materials to the Jamboree.
