class="container"><P class="lead">Our main goal is to make a reproducible 3D printed biofilm. The strength of the biofilm is determined by the degree of intercellular connectivity through curli fibers. With modeling, it is possible to determine which factors have a strong influence on the intercellular connectivity. For instance, one could argue that a higher csgB nucleator production would lead to more curli fibers and therefore an improved connectivity. But if the csgA production would be limiting, solely short curli chains would be formed possibly preventing the cells to even interconnect. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Fig. 1</B>: Illustration depicting the cells interconnecting by curli fibers. The csgA protein is secreted by the cells to the extracellular space. A curli can be formed when the csgA reacts with the nucleator protein csgB, located at the outer membrane of the cells. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">The modeling can be divided in 4 sections. In <B>section 1</B>, the csgA production rate, intracellular csgA concentration and csgB membrane concentration are determined. As our csgA production is controlled under the induction of rhamnose, all rates and concentrations are calculated for two levels of induction [ 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose ]. In <B>section 2</B>, the rates and concentrations are used in a grid model which is able to make an estimate on the characteristic time of curli formation. In <B>section 3</B> the characteristic time for curli formation is used to predict the strength of the formed biofilm.</P><P class="lead">Finally, in <B>section 4</B>, an application in MATLAB is presented able to calculate the printing time of a certain figure or shape produced with our Biolinker 3D printer.

protein. For us, this protein is csgA under the induction of rhamnose. In the kinetic modeling 

section, a quantitative model was developed to calculate the promoter strength for different 

rhamnose induction levels. After determining the intracellular csgA concentration, csgA production rates of 2 

and 3 molecules were found for 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose induction respectively.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><H2>csgA production rate</H2><P class="lead">The csgA production rate is defined as the production of csgA per second per cell. To be able to calculate this number, the following unknown parameters need to be characterized:</P><P class="lead" style="margin-bottom:5px;">    I. Activity of the promoter (with different levels of rhamnose induction).</P><P class="lead">    II. Export rate of csgA to the extracellular space.</P><P class="lead">If these parameters are known, a model for the csgA production can be formulated and the export of csgA to the extracellular space can be calculated.  </P><P class="lead">The activity of the promoter, denoted as PoPs, can be calculated by a kinetic experiment with GFP. For this experiment, we made a construct with GFPmut3 (modified GFP variant with stronger fluorescent signal) and csgA under the same rhamnose promoter. The constructs used for this experiment are depicted in <B>Fig. 2.</B></P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Fig. 2</B>: csgA-GFPmut3 construct (left), csgA construct (right).</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">As csgA and GFP are under the same promoter, the fluorescence signal of GFP can be related to the production of csgA. It is assumed that the promoter activity is independent of the addition of the GFPmut3 gene. </P><P class="lead">As already mentioned in the “Project” section, both the fluorescence and OD600 were measured. It is important to also measure the cell density, as we are interested in the fluorescence per cell per second. To calculate how much fluorescence corresponds to a certain amount of GFP (in nanogram), a calibration curve has been constructed with wtGFP. As the ratio of emission maxima for GFPmut3 relative to wtGFP is 21 at an excitation of 488nm (Brendan et. al), the correct mass amount of GFP mut3 could be determined. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Fig. 3</B>: OD600 for 0% (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose (for both the csgA-GFPmut3 and csgA constructs). </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">In <B>Fig. 3</B>, the OD600 is plotted for each of the samples in the kinetic experiment. As can be seen from <B>Fig. 3</B>, there is some difference in OD600 between the samples. Therefore, the fluorescence signal normalized by the number of cells as shown in <B>Fig. 4</B>:</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Fig. 4</B>: Fluorescence signal normalized by the number of cells for 0% (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) and 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose with the csgA and csgA-GFPmut3 construct. The error bars are included for all experiments. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">As can be seen from <B>Fig. 4</B>, GFPmut3 only appears if the culture has been induced by rhamnose. Furthermore, it can be seen that a higher induction level of rhamnose leads to an increase in GFPmut3 and thus fluorescence. Finally, as the fluorescence signal is normalized by the cell density, one can make statements about the activity of the rhamnose promoter. The promoter seems to not be active right after induction, but more after 3 or 4 hours.  This is in accordance with data from literature (Wegerer et. al), in which a low amount of fluorescence with a rhamnose promoter was observed after 2 hours of induction. </P><P class="lead">The calibration line of fluorescence versus mass amount GFPmut3 is given in <B>Fig. 5</B>. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Fig. 5</B>: Calibration line of the fluorescence signal of GFPmut3 versus its amount in nanogram. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P class="lead">The corresponding function of the GFPmut3 calibration line with <I>mass<SUB>GFP</SUB></I> in nanogram is:</P><P class="lead">With the calibration line, which was made with the exact same settings as the kinetic experiment, the mass amount of GFPmut3 per cell can be calculated.

The only unknown remaining in this model is the promoter activity, which can be varied to correctly fit the data.  </P><P class="lead">The model that was made is a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations (ODE’s) describing the GFP mRNA concentration (<B>Eq. 2</B>), immature GFP protein concentration (<B>Eq. 3</B>) and mature GFP protein concentration (<B>Eq. 4</B>) in <B>Table 1</B>. All concentrations are modeled per cell per second. The immature protein is the nonfluorescent GFP, the mature protein is the fluorescent protein (which will be fitted to the data). </P><P class="lead">In the kinetic model, the growth rate of the bacteria is not a constant (as can be seen from <B>Fig. 3</B>). The bacteria grow exponentially from 2 to 3. 5 hours before going into the stationary phase.  Until  2 hours, the bacteria are in the lag phase of growth. This growing behavior, in the order lag phase - exponential phase - stationary phase, is characterized with the following differential equation (Koseki et al.):</P><P class="lead">In order to fit <B>Eq. 5</B> to the OD600 data depicted in <B>Fig. 3</B>, <B>Eq. 5</B> was solved analytically:</P><P class="lead">From <B>Eq. 6</B>, the parameters <I>OD<SUB>max</SUB></I>, <I>q<SUB>0</SUB></I> and <I>µ<SUB>max</SUB></I> can be fitted to the OD600 data depicted in <B>Fig. 3</B>. </P><P class="lead">The fit of <B>Eq. 6</B> to our OD600 data is shown in <B>Fig. 7</B>.

However, the growth rate function correctly describes the trend of the data.  </P><P class="lead">As all the growth rate for our culture as a function of time is known, the GFPmut3 kinetic model can be applied to calculate the promoter activity for different levels of rhamnose induction. The following values were found:</P><P class="lead">As can be derived from the PoPs values, the promoter is approximately 1.7 times more active when induced with 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose with respect to 0.2% (w/v) rhamnose. 
Now, the intracellular csgA concentration will be determined in order to relate these promoter activities to csgA production rates in molecules per second.  
</P><H2>csgA intracellular concentration</H2><P class="lead">From the kinetic experimental data, the steady state concentration of GFP was 1.9∙104 molecules per cell for 0.2% (w/v) rhamnose induction and 3.3∙104 molecules per cell for 0.5% (w/v) rhamnose induction. As the csgA is transported to the extracellular space, the intracellular concentration of csgA  (steady state) is not expected to be higher than the steady state concentration of GFP. Therefore, we estimate the steady state intracellular csgA concentration to be half the steady state concentration of GFP. </P><P class="lead">The intracellular steady state concentrations of csgA are thus:</P><P class="lead">In order to calculate the csgA concentration in and outside the cell, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) needs to be defined. This model is similar to the GFP ODE system, except that the csgA is transported out of the cell. As the transporter protein (csgG) is not ATP dependent (van Gerven et. al), it can be assumed that the rate of csgA transport is dependent on the intracellular csgA concentration times a transport rate constant (kt).

This means that there is a probability for the biofilm strength to be higher for 0.2% (w/v) rhamnose induction, although the contrary is more likely. </P><P class="lead">In conclusion, if the objective is to produce biofilms with different strengths, it is better to choose levels of rhamnose induction levels which are far apart.
