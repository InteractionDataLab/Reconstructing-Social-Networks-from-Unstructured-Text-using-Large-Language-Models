Brief Description
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and constitutes 18% of all female cancers (Jemal et al., 2002) Although there has been a slight decrease in mortality in breast cancer patients (Schiffman et al., 2002), it is not uncommon for even early-stage breast cancer to metastasize. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are constantly being pursued (Bange et al., 2001). It has been reported that some bacterial species preferentially replicate and accumulate within tumors. At critical cell densities, the binding of a regulator protein to the signal leads to the switch on of genes controlled by QS and therefore a coordinated population response Moreover, they possess certain advantageous features such as motility, capacity to simultaneously carry and express multiple therapeutic proteins. Its elimination by antibiotics makes it a promising new strategy in cancer treatment. Azurin is a copper-containing redox protein with low molecular Weight which can efficiently induce cell apoptosis by raising the intracellular levels of p53 and Bax. It has been found that Azurin receptors are hyper expressed on the surfaces of cancer cells relative to their expression on the surfaces of normal cells. We do intend to modify genetic material of bacteria species that localize and induce expression of Azurin in presence of tumor only.
