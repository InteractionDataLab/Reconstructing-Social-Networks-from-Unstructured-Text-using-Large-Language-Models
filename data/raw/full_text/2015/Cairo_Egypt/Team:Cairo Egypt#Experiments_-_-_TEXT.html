General Preparation
Gel Preparation
Prepare 50 mL of 0.7% agarose gel. Add 0.35 g of agarose to 50 mL of TAE buffer and boil in microwave until all agarose is melted. Stop microwave every 20 to 30 seconds and swirl  the solution to help the agarose dissolve. Required about 2 minutes for all of the agarose to  dissolve. a. 50mL 1X TAE buffer i. 10 mL of 50X TAE ii. 490 mL of DI water
Let agarose gel solution cool to about 55C (hot but not burning to the touch). This will take only a few minutes. Take gel solution to the Gulari lab and add 10 uL of ethidium  bromide (10 mg/mL). Swirl solution to mix for at least 30 seconds
Get about a 9 cm gel cast and put barriers at each end (make sure they are snug). Pour gel solution into cast, try not to create bubbles/foam.
Use pipette tip to pop any bubbles. If bubbles will not pop, use tip to move the to the sides of the gel.
Put comp into gel to create wells. Use the 13x comb. Put the comb near the beginning of the gel, second notch from the rubber stop. Leave gel on bench 20-25 minutes to solidify.
Preparation of Antibiotics
Ampicillin  100 µg/mL
Tetracycline 10 µg/mL
Chloramphenicol  25 µg/mL
Kanamycin 50 µg/mL
Preparation of LB media
Dissolve 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl in 950 mL deionized water.
Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.0 using 1N NaOH and bring volume up to 1 liter.
Autoclave on liquid cycle for 20 min at 15 psi. Allow solution to cool to 55°C, and add antibiotic if needed (50µg / mL of Amp or Kan).
Store at room temperature or +4°C.
Preparation of LB-Agar
Prepare LB medium as above, but add 15 g/L agar before autoclaving.
After autoclaving, cool to approx. 55°C, add antibiotic (if needed), and pour into petridishes.
Let harden, then invert and store at +4°C in the dark

Discard supernatant, Wash the pellet using 70% ethanol, remove the ethanol then spin down
Re-suspend the pellet in TE buffer
Measure the concentration and purity
Making a glycerol stock :
Pick a single colony of the clone off a plate and grow an overnight in the appropriate selectable liquid medium (3-5ml).
Add 0.5 ml of 40% glycerol in H2O to a cryogenic vial.
Add 0.5 ml sample from the culture of bacteria to be stored.
Gently vortex the cryogenic vial to ensure the culture and glycerol is well-mixed. Alternatively, pipet to mix.
On the side of the vial list all relevant information - part, vector, strain, date, researcher, etc.
Freeze glycerol stock in liquid nitrogen and store in a -80C freezer. This will also be a good time to record the strain information and record the location
Transformation from the registry
(from the competition protocols)
gel purification for PCR products "thermo scientific kit"
Before Starting. Add ethanol to Wash Buffer (W1) according to the label on the bottle. Equilibrate a water bath or heat block to 50°C.
Excise. Use a clean, sharp razor blade to excise a minimal area of gel containing the DNA fragment of interest.
Using a scale sensitive to 0.001 g, weigh the gel slice containing the DNA fragment.
Add Gel solubility Buffer (L3) to the excised gel in a tube as indicated in the table. Incubate the tube at 50°C for 10 minutes (or longer for large gel slices and high concentration gels), and invert the tube every 3 minutes. After the gel slice appears dissolved, incubate the tube for an additional 5 minutes. (Optional) Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the dissolved gel slice. Mix well.
Pipet the dissolved gel piece onto a column inside a Wash Tube. Centrifuge column at >12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column into the Wash Tube. Note: The column reservoir capacity is 850 µL. Use 1 column per 400 mg of agarose gel.
Add 500 µL Wash Buffer (W1) containing ethanol to the column. Centrifuge the column at >12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column into the Wash Tube. Centrifuge the column at maximum speed for 2–3 minutes. Discard the flow-through.
Elute. Place the column into a Recovery Tube. Add 50 µL Elution Buffer (E1) to the column. Incubate the tube for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge the tube at >12,000 × g for 1 minute. 7. Store. The elution tube contains the purified DNA. Store the purified DNA at 4°C for immediate use or at −20°C for long-term storage.
