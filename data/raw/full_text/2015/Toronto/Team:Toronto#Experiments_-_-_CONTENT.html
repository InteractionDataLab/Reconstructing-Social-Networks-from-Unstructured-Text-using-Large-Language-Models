SOC increases the transformation efficiency of cells, as it provides ample nutrients to cells that have
recently undergone stress as result of having been made competent. Accordingly, it will be used in
bacterial transformation to stabilize the cells and to increase transformation yields. Since SOC is high

antibiotic stocks are typically made from four antibiotics : Ampicillin, Kanamycin, Tetracycline
and Chloramphenicol. With the exception of chloramphenicol, the other antibiotics are light
sensitive and once stock is prepared they are wrapped in foil to reduce light exposure.</P><P>  An antibiotic comes in a powder form as the basic stock and is mixed with milli-Q water
to form a stock solution. Antibiotic stock preparation follows the same basic process for each
antibiotic, varying only in concentration which is dependent on the type of antibiotic used.</P><P>  Antibiotic stocks are prepared for use either in liquid or solid media. In the case of liquid
media, the antibiotic stock is simply added and mixed in. For solid media, usually agar and LB, the
media is sent for autoclaving, and while the media is still hot the antibiotic is added and mixed.
This is to ensure that the antibiotic can be mixed evenly amongst the media before it solidifies into
a solid state.</P><P>Antibiotics are used for the purpose of selection. In terms of synthetic biology, plasmids
confer selective antibiotic resistance when successfully transformed into their target bacteria.
Using liquid or solid growth media that has been treated with antibiotics provides a selection
control for those bacteria that have successfully incorporated the plasmid.</P><H3 id="-basic-terminology-and-concepts-"><STRONG>Basic Terminology and Concepts</STRONG></H3><P>There are some terms which will be commonly used to describe the preparation of

resistance due to the lack of ions. The filters used are 0.22 μm in size to ensure a high
level of purity. This water is used for preparing our antibacterial stock to ensure purity.</P><P><STRONG>LB</STRONG> – Lysogeny Broth, is a very standard and simple media to create due to its recipe
consisting of 3 components - tryptone, yeast extract, and sodium chloride. This mix of
anhydrous ingredients is added to water and then autoclaved, producing liquid media. The
production of solid LB for plates is done by adding agar, a protein isolated from certain
species of seaweed which coagulates the liquid into a gel like form when cooled. This is
done prior to autoclaving and is poured into the plates while still hot, where it will cool
into the plate shape.</P><P><STRONG>Aliquot</STRONG> - An aliquot is a term to denote a certain quantity of something. In this case an
aliquot of antibiotic stock would denote either 1mL or 0.5mL, depending on the antibiotic.</P><P><STRONG>Antibiotic</STRONG>- Compounds which inhibit bacterial growth. They act either bacteriostatically
by preventing reproduction of the bacteria, or bacteriocidally where they directly kill the
bacteria. Generally bacteriocides work by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan in
the bacteria's cell walls. Tetracycline is an example of a bacteriostatic, where it acts by
binding to the ribosomes of prokaryotic bacteria and inhibits translation.</P><P><STRONG>Autoclave</STRONG>- A piece of equipment used for sterilization. The autoclave performs much like
a pressure cooker: it subjects the contents inside it to a high temperature and high pressure
steam bath. Usually the temperature is 121 Celsius and at 15lbs/in2
20 minutes is enough to kill most microorganisms and render equipment sterile. When
adding antibiotics to media, it is done after autoclaving so that the heat does not destroy
the antibiotic activity.</P><H3 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</H3><UL><LI>Be careful when handling the antibiotic, and avoid contact with eyes, mouth and skin</LI><LI>When pouring liquid, commit to the pour to prevent spills.</LI><LI>Use proper PPE</LI></UL><H3 id="materials-and-equipment">Materials and Equipment</H3><UL><LI>100mL Pyrex Bottles</LI><LI>Magnetic Stir Bar</LI><LI>Magnetic Stirrer</LI><LI>Antistatic Weighing Boat</LI><LI>Analytical Balance</LI><LI>Milli-Q Water Dispenser</LI><LI>50mL Falcon Tubes</LI><LI>Aluminum Foil</LI><LI>20mL Syringe</LI><LI>0.22 μm Filter</LI><LI>1mL Microcentrifuge tubes</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Reagents</STRONG></P><UL><LI>4g Amphicilin</LI><LI>MilliQ water</LI><LI>400mg tetracycline</LI><LI>80mL 70% EtOH</LI><LI>2.72g chloramphenicol</LI><LI>80mL 100% EtOH</LI></UL><H3 id="procedure">Procedure</H3><H4 id="ampicillin">Ampicillin</H4><UL><LI>Stocks and Usage Stock Concentration 50 mg/mL in milliQ water</LI><LI>Aliquots 500μL (use a P1000 set to 0500)</LI><LI>Working Concentration 50 μg/mL

placed in a calcium chloride solution prior to freezing. The solution acts to
neutralize the cells so that they don't repel each other. The bacteria and plasmid
mixture will be chilled on an ice for 30 minutes. Placing the mixture in a 42
degrees Celsius water bath for 30 seconds will heat shock the mixture, which will
cause the transformation. Once the LB is added and mixed with the transformed
bacteria, it can be plated on the LB plate with an antibiotic. Since a lot of the
bacteria will not be transformed after the heat shock, plating E. coli with an
antibiotic will ensure only the transformed E. coli survive.

Resuspend each primer to a final concentration of 25nm/mL (25μM) in TE buffer using the formula:</P><P><STRONG>Resuspension volume (μL) = nm (from supplier label) x 40</STRONG></P><P> Vortex at maximum setting for 10 seconds, let stand 10 min then repeat twice.

Store frozen.</P></LI><LI><P>Template preparation</P><P> If the starting template for the final RDP part is contained within a circular vector such as a plasmid, then linearize it by choosing an appropriate restriction endonuclease whose site is located in the vector backbone but not within the part sequence. PCR amplification from a linear template increases the final yield of the PCR product while reducing the level of lowerband contaminants.</P><P>Since the PCR reaction uses 2μL of template @10ng/μL, digest 100ng of DNA in a final volume of 10μL.

Gel analysis is a fast way of assessing the efficiency of the assembly and the yield of the product. For a good build the major gel band should also be the longest with a size corresponding to the predicted length of your design. Typically a 1% agarose gel will resolve fragments up to 10 kb. Even if the desired product is not the major band, don’t give up! The preponderance of smaller bands should be inactive and will therefore be under represented amongst in the total colony count.</P><P><STRONG>Cell Transformation:</STRONG>
In our hands, builds up to 8 parts routinely yield hundreds of colonies using chemically competent cells. Use the cell type and transformation procedure your lab feels comfortable with, but keep in mind that the more ambitious your build becomes, the fewer colonies you will get. In these situations you may want to consider using a high-efficiency transformation protocol.</P><P><STRONG>Miniprep Analysis:</STRONG>
The number of minipreps that are required to identify correct constructions will depend upon the number of parts used in the assembly (accuracy drops fractionally with the number of parts added). At Synbiota, we can generally achieve &gt;80% accuracy with an 8-part assembly (including Anchor + Cap). For assemblies up to 8 parts, plan on doing 4-6 minipreps to be on the safe side.</P><P>The final construct will contain BsaI sites within the Anchor and Cap parts that will precisely excise the circuit at X’ or Z’ ends that begin the circuit and the X or Z ends that complete the circuit. Cutting 100-200 ng of miniprep DNA will therefore result in a fragment that corresponds exactly to the size predicted by your design, and a fragment that corresponds to the plasmid backbone that will range in size from 2.2-2.5 kb, depending the Anchors and Caps chosen for the assembly. Include an uncut control lane on the gel to be sure the enzyme has cut efficiently and to avoid confusion in interpreting band identities.</P><P><STRONG>DNA Sequencing:</STRONG>
Parts produced by PCR from the high-fidelity thermostable polymerases Phusion and Pfu, introduce errors at a frequency that is less, but close to physiological (Phusion: ~5x10-7 Pfu: ~1x10-6), therefore circuit errors that are contained within parts that have been derived by PCR will be extremely rare. For parts that have been chemically synthesized, the error frequency is considerably higher (~1x10-3) but since the total amount of synthetic DNA used in any given assembly is small, the likely hood of achieving an error-free construct is high. Nonetheless prudent researchers will always determine the DNA sequence of a circuit design either before functional testing or after discovering that something about the design is not working.</P><P>Complete sequence coverage of parts or circuits that are &lt;1000 bp can typically be achieved using the BBa RFC-10 forward primer, BBa_G00100 (5’- tgccacctgacgtctaagaa) and its reverse counterpart, BBa_G00101 (5’- attaccgcctttgagtgagc).</P><P>The forward primer is located in all of the Cap parts provided, and is situated 184 bp upstream of the BsaI site. The reverse primer is only present in the high-copy Anchors, and is situated 168 bp downstream of the BsaI site*. For longer parts and circuits, the additional forward and reverse primers required for complete sequence coverage can be automatically generated using the RDP sequencing primer design software tool.</P><H3 id="references">References</H3><P>Protocol obtained from Synbiota: <A href="https://synbiota.com/beta">https://synbiota.com/beta</A></P><H2 id="ligase-cycling-reaction-protocol">Ligase Cycling Reaction Protocol</H2><P><EM>Modified from a protocol written by Naveen Venayak</EM></P><H3 id="safety-precautions">Safety Precautions</H3><P><STRONG>SDS (safety data sheet)</STRONG>: Refer to the SDS sheets for all listed materials before entering the lab.
