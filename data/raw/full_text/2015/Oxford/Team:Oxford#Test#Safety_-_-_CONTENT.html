                            Before we were allowed into the laboratory, we were given a safety induction by the safety officer of the department. This included the hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and pieces of equipment, as well as how to minimise risk. Having completed this safety assessment, we were given a laboratory induction, in which our supervisor demonstrated each of the protocols, highlighting any points where there were safety risks associated, and, again, how to minimise these. Throughout the project, we have been following the safety protocols outlined by our supervisor. These range from the basics of wearing lab coats, goggles and gloves (which we change regularly), to dealing with chemicals such as ethidium bromide, to using equipment such as centrifuges and UV transilluminators. Details of the hazards and risks, and safety precautions we took to avoid these, can be found in the lab notebook.

                                We have a variety of different options when it comes to how our bacteria will be used. Each of these has their own set of safety considerations. For example, for medical applications, we need to consider strategies that are suitable for the welfare of the patient; for instance, if our bacteria are inside the patient and need to be killed, we need to trigger a method of self-destruction which will not release molecules which are harmful to the patient. Similarly, for industrial applications, we need to make sure that bacteria aren’t going to be spread to a very wide area (eg through the water supply), so we need a mechanism of killing them as soon as they become a threat. For each situation, we have a strategy for physical and molecular containment to ensure that our bacteria will never become a health or environmental risk.
                            </P><P>
                              Each of our kill switches is based on the lac operon. AI2 is a <A class="definition" title="quorum sensing" data-content="Bacteria switching genes on/off in response to cues in their environment that indicate population density. These cues can often be signaling molecules secreted by other bacterial cells - i.e. bacteria talk to each other.">quorum sensing</A> molecule for <A class="definition" title="E. coli" data-content="The fastest-growing strain of bacteria that we know everything about. Certain strains can make you ill, but you won’t find those ones in the lab."><EM>E. coli</EM></A>. We would use a <A class="definition" title="promoter" data-content="The section of DNA that the RNA polymerase enzyme binds to before it starts making the RNA strand - it is needed to start transcription, so it sits in the DNA before a gene. Regulates whether a gene is &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; and to what extent. They can be made to be sensitive to certain conditions so that if a bacterium senses a change in environment it can up or down regulate the expression of a certain gene (so there will be more or less of the protein encoded by that gene, produced in the cell).">promoter</A> which senses AI2 (eg LsrK), which would then stimulate the production of LacI. LacI is the repressor for the lac operon. We would then have an apoptosis <A class="definition" title="gene" data-content="A section of DNA which codes for a protein.">gene</A> (Caspase8) downstream of the lac promoter and operator. When there are <A class="definition" title="pathogen" data-content="Any organism or virus that can cause disease.">pathogen</A>ic <EM>E. coli</EM>, AI2 will be sensed, so the repressor will be expressed, and will bind to the operator upstream of the apoptosis gene, preventing the expression of Caspase8, and hence apoptosis will not occur. However, when there is no AI2 (eg all of the pathogenic bacteria have been killed, and there is no need for our bacteria to be around any longer), LacI will not be expressed. This means that it will not be bound to the operator, so Caspase8 can be expressed, triggering apoptosis. Additionally, if we want to kill the engineered bacteria before all the pathogenic bacteria have been removed (for example, if there was a problem with our bacteria which we had been unable to test), we can trigger apoptosis via the provision of IPTG. IPTG binds to LacI, causing a conformational change which prevents it binding to the operator. Hence, even if AI2 is being sensed, Caspase8 will still be expressed, triggering apoptosis. IPTG is not harmful to humans, so this will have no adverse effects, and can be easily introduced through the <A class="definition" title="catheter" data-content="A small, flexible tube inserted into the body to remove fluid. Urinary tract infections are a common side effect of using these.">catheter</A>. These kill switches can be modified by adding extra layers of sensing to the promoters, further narrowing the range of conditions that our bacteria will live in.
                            </P></DIV><DIV id="project-safety-within-catheter"><H3>Sealed within a section of catheter</H3><P>
                                Our first option is to keep the bacteria within a sealed section of the catheter. We would use semipermeable membranes to create a section within the catheter, with additional membranes further up the catheter in case of perforation which would allow bacteria to escape. The quorum sensing molecules would be able to diffuse through the membranes, and stimulate a response in the trapped bacteria, and the secretion products would be able to diffuse out to interact with the pathogenic bacteria outside.
                            </P><P>
                                For this situation, we would use a kill switch that is also sensitive to valine. This valine would be provided in the medium which would be present in the catheter compartment. This would mean that if the bacteria were to escape the compartment, the valine concentration would be insufficient to allow expression of LacI, so Caspase8 would be expressed, resulting in apoptosis.
                            </P><P>
                                Good points:

                                Problems:
                                  <UL><LI>The distance between the engineered bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria may to be too great to stimulate a response in the engineered bacteria/attack the pathogenic bacteria, because the quorum sensing molecules would effectively be too diffuse, giving a false reading of the population density of the pathogenic population. This could also result in the kill switch being triggered, because if there is not enough AI2 to keep LacI being expressed, apoptosis will be activated.</LI><LI>We’d need to find a way to sterilise the catheter either with the engineered bacteria inside (this is usually done using heat, which would denature normal <EM>E. coli</EM>) or adding the bacteria later, which would likely involve puncturing the membranes, which would compromise their integrity.</LI><UL><LI>A possible way round this is to puncture the wall of the catheter itself to insert the bacteria, then melting the edges together to seal it in. This would have to be performed under sterile conditions to prevent the sterility of the rest of the catheter being compromised, which would be tricky, as the sterilisation of the catheter occurs within a sterile bag, which you’d have to puncture and reseal as well.</LI><LI>Alternatively, catheters have a balloon which is filled with water to hold them in place. This is filled by pumping water between an inner and outer tube from an external junction. This suggests we may be able to add a second tube (so you have an outer layer for pumping water, a middle layer for pumping bacteria, and a tube through the centre for urine drainage), so that we can fill a section of our catheter with bacteria after it has been sterilised.</LI></UL><LI>We can’t increase the diameter of the catheter too much, as this would make the catheter fit worse, but we also can’t decrease the inner diameter too much either, because this would reduce urine flow through the catheter, and increase the risk of blockage, which would create more problems for the patient. Therefore, it could be tricky to design a suitably sized compartment for the bacteria, which will still contain enough bacteria to be effective.</LI></UL></P><DIV id="project-safety-beads"><H4>Bacteria enclosed in beads, sealed within a section of catheter</H4><P>
                                    To add an additional layer of protection into this system, we could encase the bacteria in <A class="definition" title="sodium alginate" data-content="anionic polysaccharide is distributed widely in the cell walls of brown algae, where through binding with water it forms a viscous gum.
">sodium alginate</A> beads, which would then reside within the compartment of the catheter. This has the advantage of preventing the bacteria colonising the urinary tract even if the membranes rupture, but there is the disadvantage that the treatment would be less effective due to diffusion speeds. Additionally, the quorum sensing molecules might not get into the bead in sufficient quantity to prevent the kill switch being activated.

                                      Bacteria can be fixed to surfaces using their pili or <A class="definition" title="flagella" data-content="A tail-like structure that some cells (including bacteria) use to swim around.">flagella</A>. We could use this option to attach the bacteria to the outside of the catheter, reducing the diffusion distance of the quorum sensing, increasing the efficiency of this system.

                                    Since the bacteria wouldn’t be in media for this option, they would need a different kill switch. This would only be sensitive to AI2, but we would use IPTG to induce apoptosis if problems arose. The IPTG could be easily supplied through the catheter.

                                      Good points:

                                  Our surveys have suggested that the general public are not against altering their microbiome, and having our engineered bacteria living freely inside their urinary tracts. In this situation, they would be either injected into the urinary tract or pumped in through the catheter, with no physical containment.
                              </P><P>
                                  Engineered bacteria are introduced to the urinary tract so that they can colonise and outcompete the pathogenic bacteria. If the population of pathogenic bacteria is above the threshold value that the engineered bacteria can recognise, dispersins and <A class="definition" title="artilysin" data-content="An artifically modified version of naturally occuring proteins called lysins that attack bacteria by cleaving their cell wall">artilysin</A>s will be produced to break up the pathogenic biofilms and kill the pathogenic bacteria. Some bacteria will also sacrifice themselves to take out more pathogenic bacteria in one go, using holins to break the engineered bacterial membranes. This helps to keep the population of engineered bacteria down. For these “self-sacrificing” cells, the holin system acts as its own kill switch, since when AI2 is sensed, the cell will be destroyed.
                              </P><P>
                                  Since there would be no physical containment, we would use the free-living kill switch detailed above. Once again, IPTG would play an important role in artificially maintaining bacterial populations at a safe level, or ridding the urinary tract of our engineered bacteria entirely.

                                  Good points:

                                  Problems:

                                  In this setting, we would house the bacteria within a cartridge, which will be stuck to the inside of the pipe. The cartridge will be separated into at least 2 compartments, one containing media and bacteria, and the other which allows water to flow past the bacterial compartment. The two compartments would be separated by a semipermeable membrane, which would have pores big enough to let <A class="definition" title="protein" data-content="An essential part of all living organisms.

                                  We would include a modified version of the kill switch, which has a promoter sensitive to AI2, valine and light. This means that only when valine is supplied in high enough quantities (eg when the bacteria are within the media containing compartment), when there is no light (eg when within the pipe), and when other bacteria are being sensed, LacI will be expressed, meaning that it will bind to the lac operator, preventing the expression of Caspase8, allowing the cell to live. If any one of these criteria do not hold, then the bacteria will be killed, since LacI will not be expressed.
