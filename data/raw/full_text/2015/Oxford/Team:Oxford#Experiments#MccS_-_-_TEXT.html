MccS
BBa_K1659100 MccS
We were also at one point interested in the antibacterial peptide MccS, but because it did not act via the mechanism we needed for the holin-endolysin design we decided not to pursue it further. Its literature review can be found at its part page .
We showed that it is toxic to E. coli RP437 ∆FliC but not MG1655. This adds to the argument presented in the original literature that Microcin S’ antimicrobial capacity is narrow-spectrum and has some degree of strain specificity. More cells are killed at 30°C than 37°C, likely a combination of higher peptide efficiency and lower growth rate at that temperature.
Figure 9: Expression host cell cultures were grown in a 96-well plate at 30°C with 200 rpm shaking.

From the data we can clearly draw 2 conclusions: 1. MccS is more toxic to RP437 than MG1655, to the extent where even low induction (0.002% arabinose) inhibits cell growth in RP437 almost entirely. 2. MccS appears more toxic at 30°C than 37°C.
