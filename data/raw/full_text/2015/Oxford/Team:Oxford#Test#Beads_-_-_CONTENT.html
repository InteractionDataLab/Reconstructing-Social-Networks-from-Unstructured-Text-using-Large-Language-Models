                                To improve on last years Oxford iGEM team biobead design, using agarose to make up beads and then coating them with a ethyl acetate and polystyrene mixture.

                                In a fume cupboard, break up a standard (polystyrene) petri dish into small pieces and dissolve in the minimum amount of ethyl acetate.
                            </P><P>
                                Prepare a 150 mL 1.5 % Agarose solution in beaker with screw cap. Microwave on high for 2 minutes and then cool to 40 °C in water bath. When microwaving ensure the screw cap is placed on loosely.
                            </P><P>
                                Remove agarose solution from water bath and bring to laminar airflow cupboard. Pour the agarose into petri dish to a depth of 1cm. Allow to set; this should take roughly 15 minutes.
                            </P><P>
                                Still under laminar flow, use an autoclaved 1 cm diameter hole borer to core out the required number of identical agarose cylinders and place in a second petri dish and leave to dry.
                            </P><P>
                                Bring uncoated ‘beads’ to fume cupboard. Using autoclaved needles, pick up individual beads and dip in ethyl acetate-polystyrene solution, stand each bead on a needle upright in fume cupboard on blob of blu-tac to allow ethyl acetate evaporation and the coating to set.  When the coating is almost set the beads should be able to be handled through gloves without damaging the coat. Remove needle and mould the polymer coat over the needle hole, sealing them.

                                Ethyl acetate poses the biggest safety hazard in this experiment so therefore do all steps involving it in the fumehood. Be careful of cutting self when breaking up the Petri dish, as the pieces can be sharp.

                                150mL of 1.5% agarose was made up using 2.25g of agarose powder and 150 mL of MilliQ.

                                In a fumehood, one standard petri dish was broken into small pieces and placed into a 500mL beaker. To this, 50 mL of ethyl acetate was added along with a stirrer bar and the mixture was left to stir for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the petri dish was still not dissolved so a further 10 mL of ethyl acetate was added and left to stir again.
                            </P><P>
                                The agarose was then poured into a petri dish to a depth of 1cm and left to set for 15 minutes. After this was set, using an eppendorf tube with the lid cut off cylinders of agarose were cut out and placed into a second petri dish.

                                After the agarose was left to dry it was taken to the fumehood, to be coated. The agarose beads were placed onto the end of pipette tips and then dipped into the ethyl acetate-polystyrene mixture. These were then left to dry standing up on the pipette tips.

                                The beads were left to dry overnight and it was found that the coating did not stick sufficiently to the agarose.

                                    To see whether any bacteria had been encapsulated the beads were viewed under a microscope. However due to problems focusing the microscope this was only completed for the first 2 beads.

                                    From these measurements the denisty and volume of the beads could be calutated.

                                    Experiment from <A href="#02-09-2015">02/09/2015</A> was set up using Crystal Violet instead of Sodium Fluorescence and repeated 3 times.

                                    Beads made up using 0.1% Crystal Violet:

                                    The results from these two days of experiments were then passed onto the modelers.

                                    Data collected and the averages of the absorption taken. The concentration of the solution can then be calucalted using the calibration curve made ealier.

                                    The data was the plotted on a graph of Concentration (µM) vs Time (min).
                                </P><P>
                                    From the graph if is easy to see the rate of diffusion out the beads increases and then levels out when there is an equilibrium between the sodium fluorescence concentration in the beads and the concentration in the solution.
