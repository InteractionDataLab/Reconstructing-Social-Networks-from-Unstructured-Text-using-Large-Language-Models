We would especially like to thank our sponsors for their most generous support:
HEFCE funds and regulates universities and colleges in England by invest on behalf of students and the public to promote excellence and innovation in research, teaching and knowledge exchange. This year, the council provided our team with financial support in the form of maintenance stipends for our team members.
The Wellcome Trust is an independent charity with a vision to achieve extraordinary improvements in human and animal health through the funding of biomedical research and promotion of public scientific awareness. This year, the trust has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
The biochemical society aims to advance the molecular and cellular biosciences, to promote their impact on biotech, agriculture, and medicine. This is achieved through publication, scientific meetings, and grants for scientists and students. This year, the society has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
The society for general microbiology is the largest microbiological society in Europe. It promotes understanding of microbiology to a vast range of stakeholders through publication of academic journals and organizing international scientific conferences. This year, the society has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research council is the lead funder of academic research in the biosciences for British Institutions. BBSRC’s mission is to “Promote and Support, by any means, high-quality basic, strategic and applied research, relating to the understanding and exploitation of biological systems”. This year, the council has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
SfAM is the oldest microbiology society in the UK, serving microbiologists around the world. As the voice of applied microbiology, SfAM works to advance, for the benefit of the public, the science of microbiology in its application to the environment, human and animal health, agriculture, and industry. This year, the society has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
The Society for Experimental Biology aims to promote, and increase the influence of, Experimental Biology within the scientific community and Society. This year, the society has provided our team with financial support through their joint iGEM funding scheme.
ATDBio was established to provide high quality oligonucleotides to scientists around the world, supplying a wide range of custom-made unmodified and chemically modified oligonucleotides for small and large scale applications. The company provided our team with financial support.
Snapgene is a user-friendly, multi-purpose software, which provides a simple user interface for construct design and clone verification. This year, the company has provided our team with free temporary licenses to access their software.
Synbiota is taking biotech beyond the walls of institutions, universities, and large corporations and into the public realm. Like an Arduino for living things, Synbiota's growing collection of modular RDP Standardized DNA parts can be rapidly assembled into complex genetic circuits in hours instead of weeks or months. The company provided our team with financial support as well as a Synbiota iGEM RDP Kit under their Synbiota iGEM Scholarship program.
