                            One of the fundamental principles of synthetic biology is the characterization of standard biological parts. iGEM HQ's
                            International InterLab Measurement Study is an endeavour at achieving the large-scale characterization of a set of
                            biological devices which has been previously designed and catalogued in the BioBricks Registry. In this study, iGEM teams
                            from across the world set out to measure the fluorescence of model organisms which have been transformed with devices
                            comprising the same green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene expressed at different levels by being fused to promoters of
                            different strengths. This would provide a large dataset from which a more accurate analysis that accounts for lab-to-lab
                            variations can be drawn.
                 </P><P>
                            The promoters characterized in the 2015 InterLab Study are three constitutive promoters of different strengths found
                            within the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson">Anderson Promoter Collection</A>, which were included
                            in the 2015 iGEM Distribution Kit. We assembled each of these three promoters upstream of a given GFP-encoding BioBrick and
                            transformed each of the composite parts into three different strains of E. coli to measure their respective fluorescence levels.
                            We measured fluorescence levels using a 96-well microplate reader, a flow cytometer, as well as a confocal microscope.
                        </P><P>
                            Theoretically, we should obtain the same results from different teams since the devices used are the same but differences in lab protocol and equipment can often cause variation in results between labs. The use of multiple methods allows differences between different techniques to be quantified as well. Hence this year, we have introduced yet another method of using the MicrobeTracker software suite which is an easy-to-use data analysis method that measures fluorescence in absolute values of mean pixel intensity. We have also conducted the measurement in three different strains of E. coli for comparison of fluorescence between different strains too. Again, we believe this is an approach that can be adopted by other iGEM teams in the future to further explore possible variations in lab protocol and equipment.
                        </P></DIV><DIV class="section" id="KeyFindings"><H3>Key Results and Findings</H3><P>
                            Through the data obtained from our microplate reader, we found that the strengths of the three promoters investigated are in the same order as Anderson et al's initial characterization
                            across the three E. coli strains which we studied. The relative fluorescence magnitudes we measured however do not agree with
                            the ratios presented in the Anderson study.
                        </P><P>
                            To eliminate the dependence on equipment parameters associated with arbitrary fluorescence units, we calibrated our fluorescence
                            readings against different concentrations of a fluorescent chemical standard, sodium fluorescein, and expressed fluorescence
                            intensity in units of its concentration.

                            iGEM Distribution Kit and transformed into <I>E. coli</I> DH5α. Upon plasmid extraction (using Omega Biotek E.Z.N.A. Plasmid DNA
                            Mini Kit I, Spin Protocol according to manufacturer specifications), restriction digest was performed on the SpeI and PstI sites
                            of the promoter plasmids to linearize them, and the XbaI and PstI sites of the RBS-GFP plasmid to isolate the RBS-GFP sequence.
                            Subsequent ligations were performed to insert the isolated RBS-GFP sequence into the linearized promoter plasmids,
                            yielding the composite parts BBa_K823005+I13504, BBa_K823008+I13504, and BBa_K823013+I13504, each containing an 8bp assembly

                            Sodium fluorescein was the chemical standard of choice for the plate reader fluorescence readings as it fluoresces in the same green colour as GFP at concentrations below 0.05M (above 0.05M, sodium fluorescein has a red tint).

The solution was then neutralized with 5mL 2M NaOH (fluorescein is a dibasic acid) to obtain 10mL of 0.5M sodium fluorescein solution (hereon referred to as NaFluo).

Each device was also measured in biological triplicate, whereby cultures were set up from three different colonies on the same streaked plate and measured accordingly.

                                    Our results for flow cytometry were in close agreement to both the order and the ratios of the strength of the promoters as in Anderson et al’s initial characterization. The relative strengths measured in different strains in our study is compared against the original Anderson study in the table below.

                                    Our microscopy results showed that the strengths of the three promoters investigated are in the same order as Anderson et al's initial characterization across the three <EM>E. coli</EM> strains which we studied. The relative fluorescence magnitudes we measured however do not agree with the ratios presented in the Anderson study as shown in the table below.

                                      While DH5α and RP437 ∆FliC gave similar results for microscopy, MG 1655 gave significantly different results as the other two strains. This could be a potential source of investigation by future iGEM teams.

                                      Another observation we made was that several <EM>E. coli</EM> cells (from all the different strains) with the constructs J123101 and J123106 had unusually long sizes and large deposits of proteins. This could potentially indicate the burden placed on the cell by the strength of these promoters.

                            Our methods have all given promoter strength in the same order as Anderson’s initial characterization studies although our ratios are not entirely in agreement. Through the use of different strains of <EM>E. coli</EM>, we have also discovered strain-to-strain variations which were clearly demonstrated in the histograms for microscopy results. This, in addition to the fact that microscopy results could be reported in absolute units without the need for a calibration curve, leads us to suggest that microscopy taken up by other iGEM teams in future years. Furthermore, the aforementioned strain-to-strain variation is another interesting point worth exploring by iGEM teams in future years.
