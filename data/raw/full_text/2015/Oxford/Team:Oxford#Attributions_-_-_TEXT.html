We would like to thank everyone who has had a contributing role in the completion of our iGEM project. From the initial inception, through development and and at each apparent dead-end, weâ€™ve been lucky enough to have a range of fantastic support and guidance. We also want to give thanks to everyone at iGEM for granting us this unique opportunity.
Special thanks to:
Dr. George Wadhams
For being a guidance to all 14 members of the Oxford iGEM team throughout the summer, and being incredibly patient with us in the wet lab! As our main supervisor, he has been the cornerstone of our project, providing invaluable assistance on construct design and experimental approach, as well as advice on the Wiki and presentation.
Dr. Chris Jones
For supervising our project and providing day to day contact for experimental troubleshooting. He has been a brilliant supervisor, explaining many complex protocols to us in an easily-understandable manner. We have learnt a great deal from him, especially in relation to microscopy and data analysis.
Professor Judy Armitage
For letting us come into her lab to complete the project under her supervision.
Professor Anthony Watts
Provided support and contact on behalf of the biochemistry department, specifically in relation to securing facilities such as lab space and access to equipment.
Professor Antonis Papachristodoulou
For providing us with guidance throughout the project. He helped us steer the modelling section as well as teaching us new techniques. We learnt a great deal because of his support.
Andreas Harris
For helping us set the course for our modelling section and explaining concepts to us when we were lost.
Professor James Malone-Lee
For giving his honest,  professional opinion on our project and its place in medicine. For giving us access to his clinic to speak with Doctors and patients as  much as we needed to. Perhaps most importantly for inspiring team member George to continue work on urinary infections through his generous internship scheme.
Dr. Sheela Swamy
For replying to our queries in under an hour without fail, for welcoming George into her consultations to talk to patients, for working hard to make sure George got answers to every question he wanted to ask and most importantly for protecting George from the patients who want to get in and out of the clinic without disturbance.
Laura Evans and Jan Harris
For being so accomodating and providing us with great insight to the treatment of UTIs.
Jessica Martyn
For advice and support in the early stages of the project and assistance with the presentation design. Also most importantly for coming up with our project name!
Nasir Ahmad
For providing much needed support and advice based on his own previous iGEM experience.  Particularly with regard to the presentation and how best to tell our projects story.
Also thanks to:
Andrea Szollossi
For offering design advice on constructing infographic images figures, which have been a great asset to our poster and Wiki. We have relied entirely on Andrea to provide us with our Western Blotting protocol, and tutoring us so that we can (just about) do it properly! Also, it has been great to have her to cheer us up on a daily basis!
Matt Smith
For giving us the best advice possible on protein purification & characterisation, introducing us to the finest Bolivian liquors, and showing us that you can never wear too much stash!
Thomas Folliard
For providing advice on increasing the efficiency of our molecular cloning protocols, including improving our PCR and Ligation steps. Tom has gone out of his way to aid many of us in the understanding of primer design, and has shown us the art of Gibson assembly - a technique we were sadly unable to pursue.
Dr. Andreas Diepold
For continuously restocking us with plasmids, ensuring that we are not thrown out of the lab for breaching safety rules and giving infinite amounts of advice on secretion.
Katy Austin
For putting us in touch with the right people to get an interview at BBC Radio Oxford. This was one of our main outreach events, and allowed Mabel to tick something off her bucket list!
Eleanor Taylor
A Bang! magazine artist Eleanor designed a number of graphics for our project. These included drawings of the Biofilm and a graphical representation of our projects mechanism of action. These added to the aesthetic appeal of of our Wiki.
Christina Rode
Produced some beautiful artwork and graphics for our project. Find more of her work here: http://www.christinarode.com/
Steve Dinsdale
For his help regarding the potential manufacture plans.
James Scott-Brown and Thomas Prescott
For their help with the modelling section of our project.
Dr. Andrew McBain
For his talk on biofilms.
Professor Timothy K. Lu and Professor Jef Boeke
For offering his thoughts on our project.
Max Crispin
For raising the question of the impact on the urinary biome.
Dr. Paul Driscoll
For being responsible for the conception and upbringing of one of our team members and for liking EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of our tweets and facebook posts.
