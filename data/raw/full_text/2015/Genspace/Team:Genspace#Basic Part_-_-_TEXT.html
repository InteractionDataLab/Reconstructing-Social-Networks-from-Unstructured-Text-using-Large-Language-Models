SuperFUNd Gowanus!
The Gowanus Canal is a heavily polluted waterway that runs through Brooklyn NY. A designated superfund site, it is slated for cleanup but nearby residents are concerned about the results. Our team is developing a biosensor for waste pollution, giving the community real time access to data on the health of the canal. Additionally we have mined the canal for extremophiles with interesting properties.

Note
In order to be considered for the Best New Basic Part award , you must fill out this page. Please give links to the Registry entries for the Basic parts you have made. Please see the Registry's Help:Parts page for more information on part types.
A basic part is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. BBa_R0051 is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are many opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts.
