This 1.8 mile long, 100 foot wide, canal was built in the 19th century and historically was home to many industries including manufactured gas plants, cement factories, oil refineries, tanneries, and chemical plants. After nearly 150 years of use, the canal has become heavily contaminated with PCBs, heavy metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, sewage solids from combined sewer overflows, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). in 2010 it was designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a SuperFund site. Efforts are now underway to clean up some of the former industrial sites along the canal’s banks, reduce sewage overflows, and improve water quality. </SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c0 c29">-From the </SPAN><SPAN class="c0 c19"><A class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.riverkeeper.org/campaigns/stop-polluters/gowanus-canal/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxtruViksecsT5VjAhBreR9ItBqg">RiverKeeper  Website</A></SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c29">The borough of Brooklyn has undergone a renaissance, driving up real estate prices and luring residential developers. The vision of a cleaned-up waterway flowing through the Gowanus neighborhood has developers vying for the permits to build high-rise residential units along the banks of the canal. These proposed developments are controversial. They have been challenged by residents of the neighborhood for many reasons, including</SPAN><SPAN class="c9"> the concern that new tenants would overwhelm schools and subways, and that the buildings themselves — 12 stories in spots — would perniciously transform the low-rise mingling of factories and row houses the current canal community has come
                    to love</SPAN><SPAN class="c29"> . One of the main fears voiced by by the Gowanus community is that addition of more residential units and the accompanying sewage production would adversely affect the health of the canal, which is already prone to contamination following rainstorms.</SPAN><SPAN class="c9">“The infrastructure is not there,” said Marlene Donnelly, a designer who has lived in the neighborhood for two decades. “My biggest concern is that the project will add 700 apartments with toilets going into the canal. They’re inundating a
                        system that’s overtaxed.” (</SPAN><SPAN class="c19 c12"><A class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/nyregion/development-plan-near-gowanus-superfund-site-is-scorned-and-celebrated.html?_r%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLpMOngh07WLk3X6MiU1MticVt4g">NY Times</A></SPAN><SPAN class="c9">)</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c9">Considering the videos we have seen on line, these concerns are well-founded and because there is so much money at stake for developers, we felt that they might try to hide the consequences of their construction.</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN class="c0">After engaging with several stakeholder groups (see our Human Practices section) we decided to use synthetic biology to 1) help alert residents in real time when sewage enters the canal and 2) find value in the current polluted state of the canal

We tested one of our three biosensors in the lab and it performed as expected. In consultation with the Gowanus community, landscape designers, and homeland security experts, we brainstormed around a biosensor that could be immobilized within containers deployed along the canal, providing the community with a visual indicator of water quality. </SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c20">Microbiome Mining</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN>Genspace has an ongoing project to assay the microbiome of the canal bottom sludge. We took advantage of the protocols that had been developed for this project and collected bottom mud samples from 14 sites along the canal chosen for their different conditions. We used a protocol published by Dr. Sean Brady’s lab at Rockefeller University to safely generate high molecular weight DNA that can be queried via PCR and also used for eventual production of a cosmid library. The goal was to mine the canal bottom extremophile DNA for new and useful metabolic and detoxification pathways since the organisms thriving in pollution from coal tar, paint factory solvents, etc. might have evolved to metabolize toxic compounds and may be useful for remediation. We completed a proof-of-principle experiment by using degenerate PCR primers that recognize antibiotic synthesis pathways. Further mining via PCR will be guided by pathway analysis of next-gen sequencing data from the ongoing Genspace microbiome study.</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c0 c20 c23">Biosensor</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c11 c0">Part selection and sensor design</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c0">Inputs:</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>After the group decided to build a biosensor for sewage pollution in the Gowanus Canal, the next obvious question followed; How? </SPAN><SPAN class="c12">Our first task was to identify detectable molecules the are characteristic of human waste to serve as inputs for our biosensor.

A quick search showed that there are two parts listed within the IGEM registry that are able to detect nitrate: Part BBa K216005 and Part BBa_K381001. The first part is a PyeaR promoter, responsive to </SPAN><SPAN class="c18">nitrate</SPAN><SPAN>, nitrite and nitric oxide. Unfortunately, this part is not available. The second part, BBa_K381001, consists of PyeaR and GFP compound, and was in the 2015 registry. We could use those parts to construct a similar circuit in which NsrR is constituitively produced. PyeaR is normally repressed by NsrR,but when Nitrate or Nitrite enter the cell they are converted to Nitric Oxide which binds to NsrR, halting the repression and allowing the production of any pigment or fluorescence gene or operon downstream of the PyeaR promoter. </SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2 c0">Outputs:</SPAN><SPAN class="c2"> In discussions with community representatives, we found that a real time indicator of human waste pollution was desirable. A bright color change indicating human waste pollution would act as a visual indicator and serve not only to alert the community but also to serve as a rallying point around remediation efforts. They requested a bright color such as red, which would also psychologically signal danger from an excess of pollution. A colored substance that would remain within the device and not diffuse out would also be desirable.

Since the community around the canal asked us for a biosensor that would produce a visual indication of high bacterial presence, we realized that placement of an RFP translational unit based on the ‘Rudolph’ RFP submitted by Genspace at iGEM 2014 (</SPAN><SPAN class="c13 c12"><A class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1429001&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGT2wb7ESSs5M1_sQG_OvcjArIOdQ">http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1429001</A></SPAN><SPAN class="c2"> ) downstream of the pLux would result in a color change in the presence of bacteria producing AHL.</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2">RDP-compatible parts for the upstream Lux-based device (based on </SPAN><SPAN class="c13 c12"><A class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J37019&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYdAtidVvCy9vdd-ZqrhmtjTjIyQ">BBa_J37019</A></SPAN><SPAN class="c2">) and the downstream Rudolph RFP (based on</SPAN><SPAN class="c13 c12"><A class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1429001&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGT2wb7ESSs5M1_sQG_OvcjArIOdQ">BBa_K1429001</A></SPAN><SPAN class="c2">) were created using a protocol supplied by Synbiota and template DNA from the Biobrick distribution kit.  For the RFP translational unit BBa_K1429001 we designed the primer to omit the RBS of the original part, and instead replaced it during the build with an RBS supplied in the RDP kit.

                        appear reasonable.  The unit-step change of AHL concentration to 0.1nM results in increased activity that attenuates to negative control levels after approximately 5 hours, consistent with being on the low-end of the AHL scale.  In

inhibits LsrR transcription.  This facilitates RNA polymerase binding to the LsrA2 promoter and ultimately increases expression of RFP.  When IPTG is present, the binding of LacI to IPTG results in

The paper states that “primer sets we used in this study are known to provide robust amplification of a wide variety of A/KS domains, particularly those found in the genomes of GC-rich soil bacteria traditionally associated with the production of medicinally relevant secondary metabolites.”</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2 c0">Results</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2 c0">It appears that at least some of the samples contain sequences that are worth further exploration!</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2">A-domains</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c2">KS-domains</SPAN></P></VIDEO></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="footer"><DIV class="container"><P class="text-muted">Place sticky footer content here.</P></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
