SuperFUNd Gowanus!
The Gowanus Canal is a heavily polluted waterway that runs through Brooklyn NY. A designated superfund site, it is slated for cleanup but nearby residents are concerned about the results. Our team is developing a biosensor for waste pollution, giving the community real time access to data on the health of the canal. Additionally we have mined the canal for extremophiles with interesting properties.
