Parts Summary
We submitted 11 new parts and 2 new devices
We synthesized and submitted a sequence-verified twin ( BBa_K1799015 ) for part BBa_K216005 since there was no DNA available for that part in the registry
We characterized two parts and two devices we submitted ( BBa_K1799000 , BBa_K1799002 , BBa_K1799018 and BBa_K1799019 .
We improved BBa_K117002 , a part submitted by the 2008 NTU-Singapore team that did not work according the Experience section, by synthesizing and submitting a new, working version ( BBa_K1799000 )
