INSTRUCTORS' ATTRIBUTIONS
JIANG Jiandong:
He provides feedback to our subject, provides the sufficient funding for biological experiment.
CHEN Xi:
He provides feedback to the subject, to provide experimental guidance for biological experiment.
STUDENTS' ATTRIBUTIONS
CAO Siyi:
He created the team video for our team NJAU_China. The animation was rendered using Blender, and the post editing was done using After Effects.
CHEN Zhiqin:
He was in charge of thinking of ideas and constructed plasmid. He verified that the E.coli strain K-12(HfrH) and Orit are available. And he constructed the transfer plasmid.
DONG Shupeng:
He is in charge of blue light sensor parts assembly, it is one of the most critical part of the whole system, including a constitutive promoter, an inductive promoter ,a part of RBS, a component of terminator, and two protein genes. He is going to connect them by the method of enzyme digestion and connection in sequence.
FANG Yuxing:
Yuxing Fang is responsible for modeling in our project, including basic modeling, parameter fitting and also data processing. He also did some assistant experiments for wet lab.
HUO Fan:
She searched and discussed every possible idea with the team. She is mainly in charge of the traI.On one hand, she connects with the IDT Company, getting the synthetic traIwithout restriction sites. She also does experimental works. She is aimed to get the gene from the Hfr cell in the use of testing our system.
LI Huiyu:
This year I help to establish the team, offer ways to propose a project and evaluate it with them. I enjoy the procedure which I can share my experience with them, time arrangement experience, resources to help project, what need to be done besides the experimental techniques.
REN Weijie:
His main job is to make a mathematical modeling of our system. He search some information about the data. At last, he make a modeling for our project. Besides, he has done a research about the public awareness of synthetic biology. Then he collected the data and analyzed the data to make a research report.
SHI Xiaoke:
She was primarily responsible for outreach work, outreach is a major. 1, responsible for contacts with other universities and the ability to communicate. 2, contact the various biotech companies, purchasing agents, etc. carry out propaganda of human practice, and publicity campus iGEM trials. 4, responsible for helping the team to buy tickets and to book the room and so on.
SONG Shuang:
Song Shuang was mainly responsible for some designing work in our team.She has designed the team badge and team clothes.And she also cooperated with her partners to design the poster of our team.
SUN Libo:
He takes responsibility for Interlab Study. In the meanwhile, he constructs CRISPR/Cas9 system and GFP verifying system together with Fanjun Zheng.
SUN Zhi:
He made great efforts in the research thinking, experimental design, team building and the division of tasks. He made a functional verification of traIin the bio experiment.
WANG Han:
Wang Han was mainly responsible for some designing work in our team. He designed using our team with the Taiwan team in the activities of the team badge and some show pictures. Then he designed the team banner. And he also cooperated with her partners to design the poster of our team, for example, the team's Web site background pictures, and exhibition posters
YANG Yang:
Yang Yang is mainly in charge of constructing the red light sensor plasmid, balancing the experiments in our team and has registered parts on parts.igem.org. Besides she has communicated our project with Professor Yong Wang in Shanghai Institute of Biology Science, who gives us wonderful suggestions and did experiment there for 2 weeks this summer vocation.
ZHANG Xun:
There are two parts in this experiment and she is responsible for the “not gate” of the blue part. There are two parts in this “not gate”：Ci and P (Ci), which can be used to control the protein-coding in this signal channel.
ZHENG Fanjun:
In our iGEM team, she takes part in constructing the Erase-plasmid. She looks forward the sgRNA of GFP and cas9 from parts offered by iGEM , link them, and task the effectiveness of this system with her partners. She also takes responsibility of the introduction of the relationships and differences between bio-computer and electronic computer in the human practice.
ADVISORS' ATTRIBUTIONS
YANG Bo:
She worked hard in our activity cost and biological experiment site application, also provides help in team building and human practices.
XU Xuan:
His major work is to introduce to 2015 NJAU iGEM team members the basic information to solve some problems like what is the relationship between iGEM and biosynthesis and how can we do experiment on our own to help them kick start to prepare this competition.
