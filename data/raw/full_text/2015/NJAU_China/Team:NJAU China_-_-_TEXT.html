Introduction
The conversion of transient information into long-lasting responses is a common aspect of many biological processes and is crucial for the design of sophisticated synthetic circuits. Whereas, the most cellular memories are limited to protein levels currently, which are transient, instantaneous and unapparent. To overcome these shortcuts, this year we design a system to achieve the storage of information by a transient stimulation but use a long-lasting response. Because of the similarity with the process of memory, we call it “the horcrux”.
Our Goals
We try to use two different strains of E.coli to be our “Recorder” and “Saver”. We aim to finish the plasmid construction and functional verification, then use GFP as a report gene to get some data so we can build a mathematical model for our system and predict the effect.
In order to enable our biological system to be able to handle data processing with computer information, our students want to design a device for our bacterial system to validate system functionality and measure and collect data. Furthermore, we want it to be widely applicable to the biological research.
Accomplishment
-Biological Experiment
We tried our best to construct the plasmid, made the functional verification, got some data and established the mathematical model.
  -Device Assembly
We have designed a set of simple starting and measuring devices for our biological system, and it will be used in our prototype design.
  -Human Practice
We conducted a wide range of “virtual interviews” for our subject areas. We have also exchanged our ideas and carried out some cooperation with some teams.
Future Plan
Try to optimize the system, reduce the complexity of the system.Finish the hardware device,test the reliability of the device and use it to collect data. Try to promote our device in a wider range of application.Improving the system data, especially the core data of traI, establish the mathematical model of the main system.Try to built a prototype of the system in the laboratory.
