Red Light Sensor
T
he chimaera Cph8 is the phytochrome Cph1 fusing with a cyanobacterial photoreceptor EnvZ which can engineer a red light-regulated transcription system in E. coli, with the phycocyanobilin-biosynthesis genes (ho1 and pcyA). The promoter OmpC is repressed by the function of red light and activated by dark.

Red Light Sensor with a GFP Reporter
G
FP can be used to evaluate the efficiency of red light sensor when this part is regulated by different promoters by measuring the florescence.
BBa_K1649002
Red Light Sensor with TetR Not Gate and GFP Reporter
A
s the transcription from the red light sensor is repressed by the function of red light and activated by dark, we use a not gate, repressor TetR to ensure the system is activated by red light. GFP can be used to test whether the circuit works.
BBa_K1649004
YF1-FixJ with Terminator
T
he LOV photo-switch YF1 was created by fusing the light perception domain of YtvA to the FixL kinase domain. YtvA acts as a blue-light photoreceptor and carries a blue-light-sensitive flavin-binding LOV domain. The response regulator FixJ forms a two-component system together with FixL. The sensor is inactive in light and active in the dark.

YF1 Blue Light Sensor with GFP Reporter
G
FP is used to report the function of blue light sensor.
