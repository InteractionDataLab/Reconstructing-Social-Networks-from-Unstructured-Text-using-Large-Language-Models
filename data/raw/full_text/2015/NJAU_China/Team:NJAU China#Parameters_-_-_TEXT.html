Now that we have done the fundamental estimation of our system,we need to put them into practical use.
There’re so many ways to use our fundamental modeling and is impossible to make them all done.So we put forward one situation for example.
The system receives blue light and begins to produce fluorescence at a time of t0=0min.Then stopped receiving blue light at t1=x min and start to receive red light.
Here comes the function(to simplify,we use single cell model)
Figure3.1 the curve of piecewise functions hve been mentioned above(with leakiness expression considered).At a time of t1=200min,the blue light was shut down and the red light is turned on. It simulates the fluorescence of practical situation.
