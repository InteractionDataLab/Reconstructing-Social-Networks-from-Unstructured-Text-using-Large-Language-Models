With this idea, we recruited more people to join our team.

						My name is xuan and I’m a senior student of biology major. Last year I was a member of 2014 NJAU-china iGEM team. In this year my major work is to introduce to 2015 NJAU iGEM team members the basic information to solve some problems like what is the relationship between iGEM and biosynthesis and how can we do experiment on our own to help them kick start to prepare this competition. Also, I will offer my experience of experiments to them occasionally, which I hope can enlighten those smart guys to get around some pitfalls in experiment. </P></DIV><H1>Students</H1><P>In order to facilitate the division of tasks and work efficiency, we have divided our team students into several groups. Then let them turn to introduce themselves.</P><DIV class="njauleftmember"><P><B>SUN Zhi </B>
						Hi, I’m SUN Zhi. I am a junior of NJAU. This year I served as a captain. This is a difficult challenge for me, but still I will try my best to do it well.I am very fond of biology, it let me feel the great power of nature. I think the synthetic biology is a kind of transformation of nature, and it also deepens our understanding of the world.I think it is worthwhile to take half of year in iGEM, it taught me a lot. </P></DIV><DIV class="njaurightmember"><P><B>LI Huiyu</B>
						As captain of NJAU_China 2014, this year I help to establish the team, offer ways to propose a project and evaluate it with them. I enjoy the procedure which I can share my experience with them, time arrangement experience, resources to help project, what need to be done besides the experimental techniques.
						I’ve already been to America to receive further education and I am truly excited that I can witness their success and share the idea with worldwide students! </P></DIV><H1>Biological Experimental Group</H1><P>This group of students is the core of the team. They took all the biological experiments as well as some other tasks such as human practices. There is no doubt that they are the truly iGEMers.</P><DIV id="lastmember"><DIV class="njauleftmember"><P><B>CHEN Zhiqin</B>

Although these do not sound very related, iGEM actually provides me a way to combine them! I created the team video for our team NJAU_China. The animation was rendered using Blender, and the post editing was done using After Effects. It has been a great experience to work with my team members and to explore the world of biological electrical engineering! </P></DIV><DIV class="njaurightmember"><P><B>WANG Han</B>
