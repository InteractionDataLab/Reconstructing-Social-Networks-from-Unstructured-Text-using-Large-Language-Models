Many of the studies have done quite well. In contrast, there is a shortage of our subjects, but we also put forward our own ideas for this field. Although at present we may not see the practical value of the project, we believe that there is not a simple project in the world, we still need to do our best to complete it.</P><H1>Project Evaluation</H1><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>W</SPAN><P>e know that the purpose of human practice is to explore the impact of our subjects on our lives and the impact of this world on our subjects. As for biological memory, many aspects of the problem are similar. How much information can be stored on the disk? How fast is the rate of information being stored? What are the potential applications of biological memory? In order to get further understand of these problems, we not only have collected the relevant research, but also start a “virtual interview” with the top experts in the field of biological memory.</P><SPAN>W</SPAN>e have investigated some of the latest developments in the relevant field of cellular memory and biological logic circuit. Through the investigation of related articles, we have made a brief summary of the basic issues in the field of biological memory.<B>1st. How to define &quot;biological memory&quot;?</B>
				Almost all of the articles defined biological memory as a process is a kind of process that transforms the instant signal into a permanent signal. This process is different from simple logic circuits. It is more akin to a sequential logical system, in order to be used for more complex calculations or output in the future.<B>2nd. Why do we need to study and transform the biological memory?</B>
				Some studies suggest that the existence of biological memory determines the fate of cells. This is a determinant of cell differentiation and epigenetic inheritance. Although the cells cannot be used as supercomputers, some of them are still very interesting, they are more like a computing process. So just as a scholar said, the construction of synthetic memory circuits will improve our understanding of natural networks, further aiding the creation of useful, new biological tools.<B>3rd. What kind of mechanism can be used to achieve biological memory?</B>
				The simplest mechanism is the construction of a number of bistable systems. Latest statistics show the biological mechanisms include nucleic acid hybridization, DNA recombination, chromatin modification, transcription, and post-transcriptional phenomena. The latest research uses the reverse transcription enzyme to be used as a means to achieve a biological memory.<B>4th. What are the future applications of biological memory?</B>
				Biological memory can be used to monitor the changes of environmental ecological factors and the monitoring of the disease. It can also be used to induce the expression of environmental change. In basic research, it can be used to monitor the dynamic changes of cell populations, and to advance simple synthetic devices into expertly constructed circuits with important applications.

We hope that the device we will complete can be used as a part of biological computer——a biological disk. We believe that, besides the field of biological memory, there is still a long way to go in order to achieve biological computer. We will have to pay the great efforts in the biological interface circuit components, biological self-organization and bio logical operations, even if it is just a simple imitation of von Neumann type computer. Therefore, we discuss to make another “virtual interview”. We were divided into several groups, accessing to relevant information about the biological logic element, cell differentiation and cell signaling information group. And communicate with the pioneer scientists in these areas via email, try to understand the progress in these fields and the potential contribution which can be made by the development in order to realize the computer.</P></DIV><H2>Compared with Normal Computers……</H2><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>E</SPAN><P>xploring into microorganism’s amazing features, we find two potential improvement that our device may achieve in comparison to traditional computers.</P></DIV><P>1. Environmental Limitation
			Nowadays, electronic components are supposed to work under certain environment. However, biologists have already found that microbial life has an amazing flexibility for surviving in extreme environments — niches that are extraordinarily hot, or acidic and et cetera. Thanks to synthetic biology, we now have the ability to gather wonder features into one cell which indicates that microorganisms are very promising to be strong enough to adapt to extreme conditions.
			2. Voltage Limitation
			In a traditional computer, 1 &amp; 0 is recognized according to high/ low voltage. But as our hardware reads and transforms fluorescence intensity to digital signals, we are able to divide signals to more subtle degrees such as 0-8. This may be an advantage.

				come true. On the other hand, the capability of computer is determined by the type of electrical elements. From radio tube to transistor, from discrete component to integrated circuit even 
				microprocessor, every progress of electrical element will make huge developments in computer area. Modern silicon based computer uses binary system and actualizes logical operation through 
				Boolean logic system. The logical gate is the algorithm to realize those operations. Meantime, these logical operation can also be achieved by biological molecules. At the molecular level, proteins will make self-modification when receive different chemical signals and self-modification can be regarded as output signals sometimes. In fact, the human body itself is a powerful super computer and make logical operations all the time. Thus, biological molecules are potential to be the great substitute for electrical elements in creating powerful bio-computer. Nowadays, people have attempted to use many biomaterials to construct basic logical gates such as nucleic acid, enzymes or other small molecules.</P><SPAN>H</SPAN><P>owever, one of the most difficult problems that limit computer development is about logical circuitry micromation. The physical elements of electrical circuitry could not smaller than 0.1 um. If scientists could construct nano-size materials through biological molecules, it is probably to create smaller but more powerful computer in the future. </P><SPAN>N</SPAN><P>owadays some researchers have proved that DNA can replace electrical elements to build the logical gates and realize logical operations, such as INHIBIT logical gate system based on DNase PW17 full of G and SET-RESET logical gate system.</P><SPAN>I</SPAN><P>n summary, molecular computer based on nucleic acid has made large achievements in the past 20 years. Because DNA could probably make nano-size molecular computer come true, bio-computer can have extraordinary parallel calculation ability. Though there still have some problem remaining to be solved, bio-computer will no doubt make the development of computer more hopeful and powful.

We have designed a survey of public awareness in synthetic biology, analyzing the status quo of the public's understanding of synthetic biology.
				</P><B>Survey Report</B><H2>1. Background</H2>
			The synthetic biology occurs in China a decade ago. In China, it doesn't have a high popularity. Most people are not very familiar with it, except for some professionals. However, for biological, genetic or other technologies, most people have learn about it in the middle school and high school .Most Chinese people are more familiar with the biological and genetic technology. China has less religious people. The Chinese traditional religion such as Taoism and Buddhism does not object to the creation and transformation of life. So the country is not very opposed to the genetic transformation of life. In China, we have a lot of genetically modified food. In recent years, the media has been constantly reported on the dangers of genetically modified food. As a result, most of the Chinese people began to hold a skeptical attitude to genetically modified food. But there is no obvious opposition to the technology in China.<H2>2. Brief Introduction of the Survey</H2>
			The main purpose of this survey is to know about the public's understanding and agreement of synthetic biology. The questionnaires has 19 questions in total. We put the questionnaire on a website to collect the answers. (http://www.sojump.com/jq/5554293.aspx).There are 137 questionnaires that were collected. The main object that we investigate are the friend and classmates of our group members. The time of the investigation was from 2015/8/12 to 2015/8/16. The analysis is conducted by Excel and SPSS.

Because the most people that we investigated are the friends or classmates of our group members, the undergraduate students that we investigate should be mostly belong to our school (Nanjing Agricultural University). Our school is an agricultural university and biology is one of the strengths of our school. So they should know more about the biological and frontier science.</P><B>(2) The situation of the acquaintance of the synthetic biology</B><EM style="text-align: center;">Have you ever known about synthetic biology?</EM><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Option</TH><TH>Number</TH></TR><TR><TD>Yes</TD><TD>60</TD></TR><TR><TD>NO</TD><TD>77</TD></TR><TR><TD>Effective numbers</TD><TD>137</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>In our survey, 43.79% of people have learned about synthetic biology, which is not the same as our expectations. It is likely that the result is caused by the object of our investigation. In our survey, there are 30 (21.90%) people whose personal professional is about the biological technology, 24 (17.52%) people whose professional has some relation with the biology, 68(49.27%) people whose personal professional has no relation with the biology, 15 (10.95%) people do not fill in the question. But the 30 people whose professional has some relation with the biology, 16(53.33%) of them have been known about the synthetic biology. This is no much difference with the overall 43.48%.</P><P>The course of synthetic biology in our school is few. Most of the professional, including the professional which is about the biological technology, are not exposed to synthetic biology. So the high proportion of synthetic biology in this survey may be related to the propaganda of our school and our team on iGEM.</P><B>(3) The acquaintance of the genetic technology</B><EM style="text-align: center;">Do you know about genetic engineering?</EM><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Option</TH><TH>Number</TH></TR><TR><TD>Yes</TD><TD>135</TD></TR><TR><TD>No</TD><TD>22</TD></TR><TR><TD>Effective numbers</TD><TD>137</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>About the acquaintance of the genetic technology, as we have said in the background, most of the people have learned the course about it in the middle school and high school.

In fact, almost half of the people are supporting the transformation of the gene, very few people think that the results of gene technology will bring more harm than good. But people still have doubts about the risks of gene technology. See the following table.</P><EM style="text-align: center;">How do you think about the risk of gene technology exists?</EM><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Option</TH><TH>Number</TH></TR><TR><TD>Very high</TD><TD>42</TD></TR><TR><TD>High</TD><TD>70</TD></TR><TR><TD>Commonly</TD><TD>13</TD></TR><TR><TD>Low</TD><TD>8</TD></TR><TR><TD>Very low</TD><TD>4</TD></TR><TR><TD>Effective numbers</TD><TD>137</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Most people believe that there is a high risk in the gene technology.

Chinese people have a kind of respect for life. But because the creation of life is not entirely respect for life and nature and not entirely persecution of life, the people's attitude of the problem is not obvious. But the Chinese people's respect for life can be seen from the following table.</P><EM style="text-align: center;">Do you think that humans have the right to manage arbitrarily the simple creatures that are created by humans?</EM><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Option</TH><TH>Number</TH></TR><TR><TD>Yes</TD><TD>24</TD></TR><TR><TD>No</TD><TD>87</TD></TR><TR><TD>Not sure</TD><TD>26</TD></TR><TR><TD>Effective numbers</TD><TD>137</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Most people think that humans have no right to manage arbitrarily the simple creatures that are created by humans.</P><B>4. Conclusion</B><P>First of all, the Chinese people are more familiar with the gene. This is mainly related to the education of Chinese in middle school and high school about biology. However, the synthetic biology is a discipline which has been produced in recent years and its influence in China is not very large. So the public not familiar with synthetic biology. But from the results of our investigation, we can see that the synthesis of biology and iGEM propaganda by our school and our team, to a large extent, improves the degree of popularity of synthetic biology in our school.</P><P>Secondly, the public supports the genetic technology. People believe that scientific progress is always good for society. The genetic technology is skeptical, because there are a lot of risks and drawbacks in the public perception. In the questions that I don't list, there is a question (question 18) showing that the public wants the government and scientists to enhance the level of regulation of genetic technology.</P><P>People's attitudes toward creating life are not clear, and it may be because that people can’t create a living creature very well with modern technology. There is no clear answer to the question of whether or not creating a living creature is a disrespect for life. However, people are opposed to arbitrary treatment of the life. In Chinese traditional culture, such as Buddhism and Confucianism, maintains a respect for life.</P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/2/22/NJAU_hp_Survey_of_the_public_awareness_of_synthetic_biology.pdf">PDF file of the questionnaire, please click</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
