From the view of the design of the subject, the operation of the experiment, the promotion of the project and so on, we realize that there is a lot of work to do to ensure the safety of the project. Here we simply divide our work into three parts to illustrate our ideas.</P><H2>Safe Project Design</H2><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>W</SPAN><P>hen we first designed the subject, we had imagined that our biological system could eventually replace the U disk as a portable storage terminal. But as the further investigation of the memory and other electronic components, we found that the current biological system is far beyond the electronic components. So finally we positioned our topic as &quot;a biological memory prototype&quot;. </P><SPAN>I</SPAN><P>ts users will be some of the scientists who will continue to think about the biological memory in the future. In combination, the system is only used in biological laboratories. </P><SPAN>I</SPAN><P>f we succeed in the subject, and get further development in the future, we believe that this project will play a major role in environmental monitoring, disease diagnosis, data logging and so on. In our vision, our system and mechanical devices are used at the same time, there are two strategies to ensure the overall operation. First, we design our device as a constant culture device. Second, without continuous cultivation, the device can only be used as a short-term data storage.
Compared with other technologies that do the same thing, we think our device has a greater space for development. If we can control the proportion of bacteria, we think that our device has the potential to simulate not only binary system, and then can store more information.
</P></DIV><H2>Safe Lab Work</H2><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>W</SPAN><P>e know that the biological experiment is an experiment with a certain security risk. There are many unknown factors in the operation. There are a lot of potential risks which will lead to unsafe Laboratory. This year our biological test team members are all the undergraduate grade two or three students, most of them have experienced SRT (student researching training), and before the formal experiment, Our instructors and advisors have trained our students in the experiments.</P></DIV><P>Training programs include:</P><UL><LI>Methods of microbiological sterilization and disinfection.</LI><LI>Preparation method of microbial culture medium.</LI><LI>Microbiological aseptic manipulation technique.</LI><LI>Microbiological culture method.</LI><LI>Microbial strain storage method.</LI><LI>Polymerase chain reaction principle.</LI><LI>DNA Plasmid Extraction Method.</LI><LI>Principle of agarose gel electrophoresis.</LI><LI>method for the reAgarose gel covery of gel</LI><LI>DNA molecular cloning method.</LI><LI>Experimental method for preparation and heat shock transformation of competent cells.</LI></UL><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>T</SPAN><P>his year, our instructors come from the environmental microbiology lab and the lab of Biochemistry and molecular biology, which have formed a very mature microbiological and molecular biochemistry experimental operation skills. We cooperate with the life science experiment center of Nanjing Agricultural University, finishing our biological experiment in the cultivation of Innovation Laboratory of life science and technology talents cultivation base, which has more stringent requirements for the standard of the experimental operation. So our biological experiment is basically in a state of safe.</P></DIV><H2>Safe Shipment</H2><DIV class="first_down"><SPAN>C</SPAN><P>ross border to submit DNA sample has a certain security risk. The customs of various countries will be strict inspection of all the entry of biological products. In order to ensure that our parts can meet the requirements of the registry as well as the smooth passing through customs security, we commissioned Genscript Company completed on our security identification and delivery of plasmid elements. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
