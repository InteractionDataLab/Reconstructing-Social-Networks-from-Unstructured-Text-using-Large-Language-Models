The iGEM is a communication event. He taught us that we canâ€™t shut ourselves up in a scientific study. Many times, other people will give you unexpected help, helping you improve the subject, giving you the material to look forward to.
Here we want to express our gratitude to these teams and organizations, they provide us with the necessary experimental materials and experimental environment.
Communication between teams
Exchange activities with several teams
In April this year, we went to Nanjing University, saw their team, and carried out a simple exchange.
I
n May, some of our members went to Shanghai, where we met the team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University SJTU_China and Tongji University China_Tongji. We exchanged our idea and put forward proposals to each other.
Attending Asian conference in Taiwan
I
n July of this year, some of our members went to Taiwan, participated in the iGEM Asian conference, which was held by the National Chiao Tung University team NCTU_formosa.
Cooperation with HSNU-TAIPEI
W
e got to know HSNU-TAIPEI in the Asian Conference in Taiwan. During that time, we communicate with each other about our project. Their genetic pathway has a selection of sensitive promoter of heavy metal ions this year, with which our students are very familiar. So we discussed the project together and finally modified partial gene pathway.
