   This year, our team hopes to extend the iGEM project to the whole university, to let more people in different disciplines to participate in iGEM and experience the fun of iGEM, rather than only the students in College of life science. With this idea, we recruited more people to join our team.
Instructors
JIANG Jiandong
Our instructor, Professor JIANG Jiandong is the most important person in our team. He provides the adequate funding for our team, provided valuable advice for our subject. His research field is biodegradation of pesticides by microorganisms and the dehalogenation mechanism of halogenated aromatics by aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
CHEN Xi
Our instructor, Professor CHEN Xi is also an important member of the team. He put forward some valuable suggestions for our subject, and he is always willing to guide the experiment operation of us.
Advisors
YANG Bo
Our advisor, YANG Bo is a very kind teacher who cares almost everything about our team construction. She has been concerned about the development of the team. She has provided a lot of convenience for our team, and helped us to complete the public relations work.
XU Xuan
My name is xuan and I’m a senior student of biology major. Last year I was a member of 2014 NJAU-china iGEM team. In this year my major work is to introduce to 2015 NJAU iGEM team members the basic information to solve some problems like what is the relationship between iGEM and biosynthesis and how can we do experiment on our own to help them kick start to prepare this competition. Also, I will offer my experience of experiments to them occasionally, which I hope can enlighten those smart guys to get around some pitfalls in experiment.
Students
In order to facilitate the division of tasks and work efficiency, we have divided our team students into several groups. Then let them turn to introduce themselves.
SUN Zhi
Hi, I’m SUN Zhi. I am a junior of NJAU. This year I served as a captain. This is a difficult challenge for me, but still I will try my best to do it well.I am very fond of biology, it let me feel the great power of nature. I think the synthetic biology is a kind of transformation of nature, and it also deepens our understanding of the world.I think it is worthwhile to take half of year in iGEM, it taught me a lot.
LI Huiyu
As captain of NJAU_China 2014, this year I help to establish the team, offer ways to propose a project and evaluate it with them. I enjoy the procedure which I can share my experience with them, time arrangement experience, resources to help project, what need to be done besides the experimental techniques.       I’ve already been to America to receive further education and I am truly excited that I can witness their success and share the idea with worldwide students!
Biological Experimental Group
This group of students is the core of the team. They took all the biological experiments as well as some other tasks such as human practices. There is no doubt that they are the truly iGEMers.
CHEN Zhiqin
I’m a sophomore student in Applied Chemistry. I was in charge of thinking of ideas and constructed plasmid. Outside the lab I enjoy playing basketball and traveling.
ZHANG Xun
My name is Zhang Xun and I am from Shan Dong Province. Three years ago, I started to study in Nanjing Agricultural University, becoming a member of experimental class. I am an outgoing and cheerful girl.  In my spare time, I keen to social volunteer service and give help to others. I have lots of hobbies. I like music very much and good at playing the piano. I also love dancing, especially classical dance.I firmly believe that: Constant dropping wears the stone.
DONG Shupeng
My name is DongShupeng, 21 years old. I am a junior student in Nanjing Agricultural University. I am not too outgoing, and also not too withdrawn. Hard in working but a little lazy in life.  My specialty is biotechnology. I chose Biology as the major in the university even through the whole life-time. There must be a marvelous linkage between the biological microscopic world and the great world of universe. So IGEM give me a chance to enjoy the interdisciplinary.We can create a microscopic world which under our control.
SUN Libo
Libo Sun majors in Biology (Microbiology), he has just finished his second year in Nanjing Agricultural University. He is a fan of Synthetic Biology thanks to last year's team's presentation in the school. Outside of science, he is active in extracurricular activities. He has been a volunteer helping with computer problems for parents who have lost their only child. He also enjoys tasty foods. In a nutshell, he is a cute and smart gay (shh…).
ZHENG Fanjun
My name is Zheng Fanjun. I’ m a sophomore from life of science college. Because of the interest of biology, I chose to be a member of NJAU-China iGEM team. Actually, I enjoy the time of experiments with my partners. Through this special competition, I have strengthened my understanding of biology and experiments. My interests are not limited at biology, traveling and reading novel are also my hobbies.
HUO Fan
I am HuoFan, a junior student of fishery major. I am a member of the experimental team, and I am charge of the traI gene. I felt very happy the days when I spent with my teammates in the lab.I am fond of playing basketball with my friends. I want to walk further, and find more, that makes me excited.
YANG Yang
Hello, I'm Yang Yang from Nanjing Agricultural University, majoring in life science. I have become a senior student this new term. As a member of NJAU-CHINA, I mainly did wet lab experiment. Being an iGEMer is a wonderful experience for me and I enjoy the time being with my teammates. Travelling and reading are my favorite in my spare time. Last but not least, I am very glad to meet you.
WANG Weiyi
Major in biology also try to do some electronic stuff. It‘s fun but it’s hard too. Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy gold!
Mathematical Model Group
This group of students is responsible for processing a large number of experimental data and trying to build a complete mathematical model using their excellent mathematical thinking.
REN Weijie
My name is Ren Weijie, I live in Zhangjiagang, Suzhou, China. I like mathematics, like reading book, like watching movies, like listening to music. The favorite song is Pachelbel's Canon in D. My major is sociology. I’m learning the liberal arts, but I am doing the things that are done by the science students. I'm a person who do not like sports and usually be lazy all day. In all, a man is full of conflict and a man wants to do a lot of things.
FANG Yuxing
Greetings. I’m Yuxing Fang, studying life science for major. Always hitting the door beam of laboratory with my height of 1.93meters (shoes on).Mainly in charge of the modeling. Love Math as well as biology. I like playing soccer though not good at. The hatest thing is hearing someone saying ‘oh my, can’t believe you don’t play basketball’. Again, I like soccer.

Art Group
This group of students has a very high artistic talent and inspiration. They can put all the pictures you can imagine into reality.
CAO Siyi
Hi! My name is Siyi Cao. I'm a junior in Brandeis University majoring in Computer Science and Biology. I'm very interested in computer animation and biological concepts. Although these do not sound very related, iGEM actually provides me a way to combine them! I created the team video for our team NJAU_China. The animation was rendered using Blender, and the post editing was done using After Effects. It has been a great experience to work with my team members and to explore the world of biological electrical engineering!
