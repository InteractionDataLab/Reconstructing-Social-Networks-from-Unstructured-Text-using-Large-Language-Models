So now that you have made it through to the very end of our wiki site, we want to thank you wery much for taking the time to explore our project. Hopefully  it sounds as interesting as we think it is, even though that is most unlikely.
First step is the Giant Jamboree on the 24th-28th of September in Boston, which we cannot be more excited about. We are looking forward to meet all the other fantastic teams, so many of them for the first time and a handfull of them again. And not at least discover all the incredible possibilities of synthetic biology. To take a philosophical approach to what is next we thought of the following.
What are we thinking of when we think of the future? Do we think of flying cars using Shawyer's EmDriveEmDriveelectromagnetic thruster, Global Robot Rights or   human civilization on distant planets? All of the above and all other thoughts of the future are mental constructions inferred from the past. One might argue that the material past and the material future are exactly the same just wrapped in different semantic paradigms. It is actually impossible to be in the future, but the future is constituted by the immediate past, and the now is impossible to grasp. So is the past actually the future?

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
