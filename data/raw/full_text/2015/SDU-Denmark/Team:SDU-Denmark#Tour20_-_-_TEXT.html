The antibody issue
Figure 1: A predicted Peptide Aptamer structure using Phyre2.
Since 1975, where Kohler and Milstein initiated the current era of antibody production by introducing the hybridoma technology, the applications have continuously been extended and mAbs have become an essential part in many aspects of research. Reference: Liu JK1 (2014) The history of monoclonal antibody development - Progress, remaining challenges and future innovations. Sep 11;3(4):113-6.
DOI: 10.1016/j.amsu.2014.09.001. [PubMed] The production is a bio engineered process carried out in mammalian cells. Despite several advantages, some drawbacks of using mammalian cells are often disregarded: they are cumbersome, costly and at the expence of animal lifes. Foremost requirements for a system capable of making mAbs are high growth rate and high production yield. The demand is continuously growing and the production market is exponentially rising. In the end of 2014, 47 mAbs have been approved for treatment in US and Europe and this number is estimated to be ~70 in 2020, with a world-wide revenue at nearly $125 billion.

We find it important to consider the cost, effectiveness and not at least the ethics that are connected to the use of animal cells. The effectiveness of antibodies is high, however, so is the cost. Despite strict control and legislation in Denmark regarding animal conditions, an alternative to laboratory animals will always be preferable. Furthermore  the decade long search for alternatives to animals in research implies that scientists also find the existing method  controversial. Read our page Animal Ethics for more information about this.
Peptide aptamers are molecules consisting of a scaffold protein with a variable loop ( Figure 1 ), which make them perfect in the search for an alternative to traditional antibodies ( Figure 2 ). The variable part can function as the heavy and light chains of an antibody, in which the variable loop functions as the antigen binding region.    By manipulating Escherichia coli into producing peptide aptamers many of the drawbacks by using mammalian cells will be minimized. Read more at The Alternative .
