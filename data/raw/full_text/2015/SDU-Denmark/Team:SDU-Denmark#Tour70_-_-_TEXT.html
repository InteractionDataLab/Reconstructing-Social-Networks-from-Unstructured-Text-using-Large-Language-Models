What is next?
Not all good things have to end. We present this year's iGEM project at the Giant Jamboree in Boston the 24-28th of September, but this does not mean the work on the project has to stop. We have been working within a strict time frame, but if there had not been a limit, our project could likely have moved mountains.
Despite of all our efforts; in the lab, in the community, on the wiki and with everything else there came along, many aspects still remains unexplored. We have thought and discussed next steps and a fare out future that could take this project to its next level.
Figure 1: PAST is the future.
A lot of the future work would be in the wet lab, aiming to examine a peptide aptamer, determine some of its parameters such as its affinity towards its target and its specificity. To read more about our idea for the future laboratory work, please go to Lab Work .
To know ones limitations is beneficial, because first then and only then, can one challenge and push his own limits. Working with living organisms provides many challenges and boundaries that we have yet to push through. We are aware of the limitations for our project. For more on this topic please go to Challenges and Limitation .
However, the challenges and limitations do not stop us, the peptide aptamers produced with our constructs have a broad range of usage opportunities. Apart from challenging the antibodies used in science, they also show promises in a medical aspect. We have discussed some of these aspects in Medical Aspect .
What the future brings no one can predict, but we are pretty sure that PAST is the future. The end .

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
