Peptide Aptamer Screening using Two-hybrid system
This is a project focusing on finding an alternative to the traditional antibody production. Currently, all marketed antibodies are made in vitro, by exploiting mammalian cell's immune system and its ability to produce antibodies against a certain antigen. Increasing demands implies the necessity of quicker methods to drive down the costs of production, both because of economical issues and the expense of animal lives. These are exactly the issues that we have been trying to accommodate. Sounds interesting, right? Take a tour through our wiki either by the menu function on the top of the page or the use our interactive tourmenu. Enjoy!
