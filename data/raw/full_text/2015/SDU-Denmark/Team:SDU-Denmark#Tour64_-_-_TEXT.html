"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales." - Albert Einstein
The Curios Little Story about a Curios Little Being
All the statistics show that it is the level of knowledge regarding GMOs that constitutes   people's attitude towards GMOs. Actually, this mechanism is quite natural and concern many   other instances. The less we know about a certain thing, the more we fear it, and if the road is   paved with fear, then irrational attitudes will be the offspring of irrational arguments. Our   mission is not to convert anyone's opinion concerning GMO, but to make people talk about it.   A GMO itself is not right or wrong, the existence of an organism cannot be wrong, it is how   we decide to use it that can be ethically discussed.   is the way to make sure that whatever opinion one might have, it is built on a solid foundation.   But how do we even start. People can be very hardheaded. Why are they hardheaded?   The have been shaped, twisted and turned by the circumstances of life and are in no way   what so ever in a place where such complicated issues  as GMOs can prioritized. They do not have the time... Then we  asked ourselves, if we were to share my thoughts on GMOs   with someone who has the time and it is not bias then that should it be? Children, of course.
Children are  blessed with an unpolluted mind and a wonderful ability to ask the most obvious questions in   ways that require not so obvious answers.  But for these questions to come into existence   and be verbalized by children, they must be introduced in a form that is understandable and in   some lengths entertaining.  If we can introduce  children to GMOs and at the same time tell   them a story with existential implications it just might do the   job.  Ripples of enlightenment   have been set in motion.  An introductory children's book about   GMOs with an undertone   of existentialism.  For Kids. Why make it easy?
A story for adults and children on the subjects of GMOs and Existentialism.  Some illustrations are  uncolored so that you can color them yourself.  There are both a digital version and a printable version.
Underneath this section we bring you a little teaser of our amazing children's book which is done by the SDU-Denmark 2015 team, sponsored by University of Southern Denmark and inspired by iGEM. If you want to read the whole book, you can open and/or download it right here: The Curios Little Story about a Curios Little Being Download
