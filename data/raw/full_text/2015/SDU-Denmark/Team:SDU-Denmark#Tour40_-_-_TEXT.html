Process
Figure 1: A process consists of multiple stages. This is the overall process the team went through.
20th-22nd March was the weekend where our process began. The preparation phase was initiated by a trip to Langeland, an idyllic place in the South Funen Archipelago. This was our supervisors idea, the ultimate opportunity to meet each other and brainstorm on projects. The trip was a success and we returned to SDU with a great idea in our minds; PAST (peptide aptamer screening using two-hybrid system) is the future.
Next, the idea phase, with several group meetings, discussions on how to execute our project and the  possible aspects that should be included. We designed a model for our system and started building our BioBricks, first on paper and then in the lab. To see which protocols, primers and such that we have used, please go to our Complete Journal .
Collaborations is one of the key stones in iGEM and of course we did a lot of it. Just to mention some of it, we went to Lithuania and exchanged some good advice with their brand new team. Helping others and receiving help is one of the things you can read about in our Collaboration section in this chapter.
Safety is an utterly important item on the agenda when working with genetically modified organisms. The worst case scenario would be if something leaked into the environment and caused irreversible damage. Go to our Safety page and read about how we have handled this aspect of our project.

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
