Standard Two-hybrid System Devices
BBa_K1638005
Plac-T18: The T18 domain of cyaA with a lac promoter. Intented for use in the bacterial two-hybrid system, where a protein of interest can be fused to the C-terminal. The bacterial two-hybrid system allows detection of protein-protein interactions.
BBa_K1638003
Plac-T25: The T25 domain of cyaA with a lac promoter. Intented for use in the bacterial two-hybrid system, where a protein of interest can be fused to the C-terminal. The bacterial two-hybrid system allows detection of protein-protein interactions.
BBa_K1638032
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T18: The T18 domain of cyaA with a lac promoter. Intented for use in the bacterial two-hybrid system, where a protein of interest can be fused to the C-terminal. The bacterial two-hybrid system allows detection of protein-protein interactions. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a protein-protein interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
BBa_K1638033
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T25: The T25 domain of cyaAA with a lac promoter. Intented for use in the bacterial two-hybrid system, where a protein of interest can be fused to the C-terminal. The bacterial two-hybrid system allows detection of protein-protein interactions. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a protein-protein interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
Control Devices
BBa_K1638011
Plac-T18-Zip: Leucine Zipper fused to the T18 domain of cyaA. The expression of the gene is under control of a lac promoter. This part can be used to validate the bacterial two-hybrid system as leucine zippers is known to form a homodimer.
BBa_K1638013
Plac-T25-Zip: Leucine Zipper fused to the T25 domain of cyaA. The expression of the gene is under control of a lac promoter. This part can be used to validate the bacterial two-hybrid system as leucine zippers is known to form a homodimer.
BBa_K1638031
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T18-Zip: Leucine Zipper fused to the T18 domain of cyaA. The expression of the gene is under control of a lac promoter. This part can be used to validate the bacterial two-hybrid system as leucine zippers is known to form a homodimer. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a positive interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
BBa_K1638030
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T25-Zip: Leucine Zipper fused to the T25 domain of cyaA. The expression of the gene is under control of a lac promoter. This part can be used to validate the bacterial two-hybrid system as leucine zippers is known to form a homodimer. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a positive interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
Screening Devices
BBa_K1638018
PLlacO-1-T18-linker-hTrx_scaffold-(3xFlag): The human thioredoxin scaffold fused to the T18 domain of cyaA through a flexible linker. The human thioredoxin scaffold is a scaffold used for presentation of peptide aptamers. When a random nucleotide library is inserted into the scaffold, one can use the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen against specific targets. An affinity 3xFlag-tag is fused to the C-terminal for detection purposes. The part is under control of the hybrid PLlacO-1 promoter.
BBa_K1638035
Plac-T18-linker-Intein-hTrx_scaffold-(3xFlag): The human thioredoxin scaffold fused to the T18 domain of cyaA through intein and a flexible linker. The human thioredoxin scaffold is a scaffold used for presentation of peptide aptamers. When a random nucleotide library is inserted into the scaffold, one can use the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen against specific targets. The intein is added for affinity purification purposes. This allows us to only purify the pure hTrx-based peptide aptamer. An affinity 3xFlag-tag is fused to the C-terminal for detection purposes.
BBa_K1638037
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T25-linker-CsrA: The carbon storage regulator CsrA fused to the T25 domain of the adenylate cyclase, CyaA. Made for the purpose to be a 'bait' in a peptide-aptamer screening using the hTrx-based peptide aptamer fused to the T18 domain of CyaA. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a positive interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
BBa_K1638038
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T25-linker-YhbJ: The RNase adapter protein YhbJ fused to the T25 domain of the adenylate cyclase, CyaA. Made for the purpose to be a 'bait' in a peptide-aptamer screening using the hTrx-based peptide aptamer fused to the T18 domain of CyaA. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a positive interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
BBa_K1638039
PcstA-RFP-term-Plac-T25-linker-Hfq: The RNA-binding protein Hfq fused to the T25 domain of the adenylate cyclase, CyaA. Made for the purpose to be a 'bait' in a peptide-aptamer screening using the hTrx-based peptide aptamer fused to the T18 domain of CyaA. The cAMP-induced promoter PcstA induce transcription of RFP when a positive interaction occurs and the T18 and T25 domains associate and catalyse the formation of cAMP.
Reporter Fusions
BBa_K1638009
Plac-T18-linker-GFP: Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to the T18 domain of the adenylate cyclase CyaA through a flexible linker. This part is used to check gene expression and validate that T18-fusion proteins will fold correctly.
BBa_K1638010
Plac-T25-linker-GFP: Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to the T25 domain of the adenylate cyclase CyaA through a flexible linker. This part is used to check gene expression and validate that T25-fusion proteins will fold correctly.
BBa_K1638007
linker-GFP: A flexible 10 amino acid linker fused to the N-terminal part of GFP. Intended for use in protein-GFP fusions, where this part can be suffixed to various proteins as a reporter of gene expression.
Others
BBa_K1638036
PLlacO-1-Intein: This part consist of an intein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA1 gene including a CBD-tag. This intein is a thiol-induced self-cleavable protein that enables the release of a C-terminal fused protein. The intein is under control of the hybrid PLlacO-1 promoter.
