Our team represents four different faculties; the faculty of science, the faculty of health sciences, the faculty of humanities, and the technical faculty.

Coming from different backgrounds and with different competencies we wanted to find a project that could unite our different set of skills and make them work synergistically.
</P></DIV><DIV class="memberWrapper" style="opacity:1;"><H3 class="team"> Kathrine Balslev Skovmøller </H3><P> Since I have some experience in creating magazines and other graphic work my primary job has been to develop our wiki and other PR  related tasks. Though I have never tried doing either HTML or CSS before it has been great fun and I have learned a lot of new awesome stuff. In my real life I study medicine on my 6<SUP>th</SUP> semester. My motivation for participating in this project was to meet new challenges and of course  have a fun summer and meet new people! I have been working on the medical and therapeutic perspective of our project.

Working with the iGEM team for the last couple of months has been the most fun and difficult time I have had at the university so far. What I have been doing most this summer was helping the others in their doings, in the wet-lab, a little dry lab and mainly Wiki. I have been jumping around between a lot of tasks and “groups”. I have been doing optimization for protocols and SOPs, plotting in missing details before uploading them to the wiki.

As a student of biomedicine I have a great interest in microbiology and molecular biology in a clinical perspective. My primary efforts have been in the wet-lab, but I have also had PR-related tasks. With a great interest in communication of science, I have also become the key presenter of our group. My motivation for applying for iGEM was to get a lot of “hands on”-experience and the chance to immerse myself into the subject. Throughout the project I have been challenged both professionally and personally but it has been challenges that I would not have been without.

I am currently studying biomedicine on the 5th semester, and when the opportunity to join the iGEM project presented itself, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to find new challenges and gain more experience in the lab. I have mainly been working in the wet-lab, and there I have faced exciting challenges and opportunities that allowed me to put the theoretical knowledge into practice. In addition to the scientific aspect, there is of course the interpersonal relations, which I feel the project encouraged us to expand on.

I am Miss Wet-Lab, here for the fun and experience in the laboratory. In the latter part of the project I transferred to the wiki-team for a better distribution of hands. I have studied Biomedicine for two years just starting on the third. Our project here in iGEM excites me because that all the knowledge I have achieved through my studies has been put to the test. Even through frustration and long nights this summer has been one to remember and if I got the chance, I would gladly do it again!

As a student of philosophy I have taken on the job to take a closer look at the ethics concerning synthetic biology and the extremely important enlightenment of the broader public.
I applied to iGEM because of the challenges along the way, the new acquaintances with equally curious people as myself, and last but not least the professional experience.

I am studying Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on my 5th semester. Participating in the iGEM competition has been very rewarding in all sorts of levels. Both when it comes to lab experience, but also with regard to how to work on a team project. The dry-lab has been my area of responsibility. I have always liked exploring everything in depth, so keeping track of sequences, designing constructs and having a theoretical overview of the project has come naturally to me. To transfer theory into practice is a passion of mine so it has been difficult to restrain myself from the wet-lab. For this reason I ended up spending many hours in the wet-lab too.

I am studying biomedicine on my 5<SUP>th</SUP> semester and I have primarily been working in the lab and on the oral presentation. My motivation for participating in iGEM was to get a lot of experience in the wet-lab (which I have gotten) and to get a summer that was not like any other.  There has been many late nights working in the lab followed by cheap red vine and foosball, which has made this iGEM-summer awesome!

I am studying chemical engineering on the 5<SUP>th</SUP> semester. Throughout my education I have sought challenges and joined iGEM to learn even more. It is my passion to work with novel ideas that could lead to great innovative initiatives. Though dipping my toes in the pool of wet-lab my main purpose has been to give this project a twist of real life in the form of a business plan and process design.
