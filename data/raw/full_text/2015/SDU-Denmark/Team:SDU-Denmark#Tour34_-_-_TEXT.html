Figure 1: Process Flow Diagram (PFD)
We as a team has decided to enter the manufacturing track. This was due to our excitement of the applicability of our project. We feel strongly, that the need of a replacement for mAbs and not least the opportunity to reduce usage of laboratory animals, should be explored on an industrial level.
The aim of PAST is to cater to customers with very specific needs. Therefore it has been decided to design several small-scale operations, which will allow the company to efficiently fill changing orders without accumulating large stocks.  It has not been possible to determine any values for the process design experimentally, therefore estimates has been made using data obtained on proteins considered to be as close in properties as possible to the peptide aptamers. Protocols and research papers have been extrapolated linearly, which is most often not possible. Therefore experiments should be conducted on both laboratory and pilot scale, and this proposal should only be taken as an indicator of the feasibility and competitiveness of the operation, and thereby the validity of carrying out the necessary experiments.  Below is our process design. Click the boxes to dig deeper into each section.
A1: Autoclave
Figure 2: Autoclave A1
Before the fermentation can begin, the substrate must be sterilized to avoid contamination of the   fermentation broth. For this procedure a batch   sterilization has been chosen. To ensure sterility the feed is heated to 121 [°C], the pressure set at 2 [bar] and the   residence time at 30 [min]. Reference: Michael L. Shuler and Fikret Kargi. Bioprocess Engineering - Basic Concepts; second edition; Pearson Education International; 2002 This was simulated in Aspen Plus using the BK10 method, and only the   compounds available in the database were considered. The simulation showed a volume of the autoclave of   26.6 [L] and a heat duty of 48,483 [kJ/batch]. The substrate consist of Water (H2O), Glucose,   Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), Monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), Epsom salt (MgS·7 H2O), Calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O),   Ironsulphate (FeSO4), L-arganine·HCl, tracemetals and Ampicilin, the composition can be seen in table 1. The   amount and composition of the substrate was based on a research artic le.. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

To avoid a flash occurring in the fermenter and ensure the survivel of cells, the substrate has to be cooled to 37 .[°C]. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch. Recombinant Trypsin Production in High Cell Density Fed-Batch Cultures in Escherichia coli. Biotechnology and Bioengineering. 1993; 41: 781-790 It has been chosen to grow the cells at   this temperature, though growth at lower temperatures have been shown to decrease the amount of   inclusion bodies formed. It has to be investigated at a later point if lower temperatures and the following   prolongation of cycle time, could lead to an increase in production. Reference: Jeffrey Fu, David B. Wilson and Michael L. Shuler. Continuous, High Level Production and Excretion of a Plasmid-Encoded Protein by Escherichia coli in a Two-Stage Chemostat. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 1993; 41: 937-946 As in A1 a simulation was run in   Aspen Plus, the results showed the use of cooling water to be 5,474 [L/batch], and a heat duty of   15,196,014 [kJ/batch].

Fermentation is carried out under two conditions. In this first phase growth is carried out as a batch until  glucose is depleted, and will take approximately 13 [h]. After which, cells will be grown to high densities in a   fed-batch. One hindrance for accumulation of high biomass concentrations is the formation of inhibitors as   acetate. By restricting the carbon source this formation can be reduced greatly, which can be viewed in   figure 5. The figure describes the experimental results presented in the research paper used for estimates.   The inoculum is scale linearly as in the case of the substrate. Therefore the same cell concentration is kept   and the time will not be affected. The fed-batch and induction will be discussed further below. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

The substrate used for the fed-batch phase of the fermentation is sterilized in A2.  The same type of   sterilization and conditions as in the A1 are chosen. Simulation in Aspen Plus   yielded a volume of  16.2 [L] and a heat duty of 7.457 [kJ/batch]. The composition of the   substrate can be viewed in table 4. It should be noted that in order to avoid  dilution of the cell concentration, the concentration of glucose is considerably   higher than in S1.. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

R1.2: Fed-batch fermentation
Figure 8: Fed-batch fermentation
As mentioned above, the fed-batch facilitate high yield of dry cells. The experimental data from the research  paper showed that a concentration of 75 [g dry cells/L] was reached after 27 [h]. This was deemed an   appropriate level to start induction. The results also showed that substrate was fed in a rate, where   glucose did not accumulate in the broth, and furthermore that the levels of acetate after an initial rise was non-  existent in the end of the fed-batch phase, see figure 5: Batch fermentation. The composition of   the fermentation broth before induction can be viewed in table 6. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

R1.3: Induction
Figure 9: Induction
Now the production of peptide aptamers can begin. The production is induced by Isopropyl-β-D-  thiogalactoside (IPTG), which is added to a concentration of 2 [mM]. The target concentration of product will be discussed during the   elution phase of the product recovery. The composition at start of induction and of the fermentation broth   can be viewed in table 7. It was shown that inducing in the late log phase let to  high yields of production, reducing the production phase to 4 [h]. Another benefit of the shortened residence time of the product, which reduces the risk of degradation by for example proteases. In the research paper the yield of product was reported to be   56 [mg/L] and the dry cell concentration was 92 [g/L]. Reference: L. Yee and H. W. Blanch.

C1.1: Equilibration
Figure 10: Equilibration of C1
This is the first step of the product recovery. Before applying the fermentation broth to the column it needs  to be fluidized. The fluidization process is described in greater detail during the next step. An important   parameter for the creation of a stable bed is viscosity, should viscosities of the different buffers used vary   in a degree that destabilizes the bed an inert viscous liquid will be added.. Reference: Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.

The expansion is achieved be applying 10 bed volumes (BV) of column buffer (20 mM (4-(2-  Hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt) (Na-HEPES) and 500 mM Sodium chloride   (NaCl)) at a flowrate of 300 [cm/h], which is recommended, though flows between 200 and 400 [cm/h] has been shown   sufficient. The composition can be viewed in   table 8. Determination of the BV relies on the production (see  equation 1), it has been decided to produce 2 [g/batch] of the peptide aptamer. This decision will be   elaborated in the decription of the elution step (C1.4). Reference: NEB-impact

BV [L]=(binding capacity of the beads [g/L])/(mass of product [g] ) = 1.19 L (1)
To estimate the time needed for equilibration, we need to estimate the volume of the column. Expansion is   reported to be 2-3 BV, therefore an expansion of 2.5 BV was chosen for calculations. Thus the column should   be able to contain approximately 3 L. A column with a diameter of 50 [mm] is deemed to be appropriate for   this process. To transfer this flowrate to a volumetric, it is calculated how large the volume is per cm, which   is approximately 0.02[L]. This corresponds to a volumetric flowrate of 6 [L/h]. Now the time of application   can be calculated to be 2 [h] and the height of the column to be 1.5 [m]. Reference: NEB-impact

C1.2: Application and wash
Figure 11: Application of fermentation broth and wash of C1
The benefit of the EBA is, that the fluidization leaves space between the beads for particulate matter to  pass through. Rendering the solid separation steps of traditional product recovery unnecessary.   This type of chromatography has been reported to be a one-step purification. Another benefit is the time reduction before the protein  is bound to the beads, further reducing the residence time.. Reference: Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.
(Link) Accessed July 18th 2015]
The bed is fluidized by controlling the density of the beads, and thereby the downward force of   sedimentation, and the upward force created by the flow. The sedimentation velocity is controlled by the   design of the beads. In a stable bed the beads follow a Gaussian distribution. This is obtained by varying the   density of the beads. Therefore the ordinary agarose beads are fitted with inert cores of varying diameters.  An unstable bed leads to risk of turbulence or   channelling, which will say that the feed does not have sufficient contact with the beads to bind the   peptide aptamers efficiently. Reference: Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.

In this step the fermentation broth is applied first, after which all impurities are washed out of the column by  applying 20 BV of column buffer. The streams can be viewed in table 9. Reference: NEB-impact

In this step Intein selfcleaves releasing the peptide aptamer. This is achieved by flushing the   column with 3 BV of cleavage buffer (20 mM Na-HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM threo-1,4-Dimercapto-2,3-  butanediol (DTT)), where after the resin is left at room temperature for 16 h, therefore it is assumed that all   buffer leaves the column as waste in this step. It has been reported, that product recovery is above 95%, therefore it is assumed that 95% will be cleav ed.. Reference: NEB-impact

Figure 15: Elution of peptide aptamer
Now the product is ready to be eluted with column buffer. Since the peptide aptamers are an alternative to   monoclonal antibodies, the concentration of the end product has been chosen by comparison of 50   products from Sigma-Aldrich. Concentrations of the antibodies range from 0.5-2 g/L, the most common   concentration (39 out of 50) was found to be 2 g/L, thus making this the target concentration of PAST’s   products. See pdf ( Sigma-Aldrich antibodies ) for details. Reference: NEB-impact   Pharmacia. Introduction to Expanded Bed Adsorption.

Due to the changing productions and the decision to release the broth at a predefined viscosity,   concentrations of the product in each batch will fluctuate. Therefore the aim is to produce 2.5 g of the   peptide aptamer per batch. The wanted concentration is reached by measuring the concentration at the   release of the broth and adjust the elution accordingly. This determines the volume   of the elution, the result can be viewed in table 13. Elution is performed with column buffer. If this buffer is   not suited for storage, it can be changed by dialysis, though for now it is assumed appropriate. Reference: NEB-impact

C1.5: Regeneration
Figure 16: Regeneration of the column
The last step of the product recovery is regeneration of the column, which prepares it for the next batch. It   has been reported that the resin can be reused 4-5 times, it is assumed that 4 times is appropriate. Regeneration is   performed by washing the bed with 3 BV of stripping solution (0.3 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) and   then leaving the bed to soak for 30 minutes. After which the column is washed with additional 7 BV of the   stripping solution, followed with 20 BV of water. Lastly 5 BV of column buffer is applied. Reference: NEB-impact
