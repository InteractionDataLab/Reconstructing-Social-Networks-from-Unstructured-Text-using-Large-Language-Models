"No one undertakes research in physics with the intention of winning a prize. It is the joy of discovering something no one knew before." - Stephen Hawking
Medal Requirements
Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
For a pice of the fun visit our Gallery
Complete the Judging form.
Click to view Judging form
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
For the project description go to Introduction and to view our Submitted parts
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We welcome and encourage you come see us at the Giant Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
All for the great people who stod by us though this process Attributions
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
BBa_K1638035
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
BBa_K1638009
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
We made a Survey, presented at UNF, visited the animal facilities at Odense University Hospital for more work beyond the bench go to Practices
Gold
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities).
Check out our Children's picture book
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Visit first time iGEM team from Vilnius university, sharing knowledge and experiences. For more visit Collaboration
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. This part must not come from your team's 2015 range of part numbers.
