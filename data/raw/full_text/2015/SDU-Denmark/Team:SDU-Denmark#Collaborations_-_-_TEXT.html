Collaborations
Figure 1: All the awesome people from the Nordic Jamboree. You guys rock!
A huge part of iGEM is collaboration and open source community. In the spirit of iGEM, we went to Lithuania from the 1st to the 3rd of June to help the Vilnius iGEM Team getting started on their project. Through the experience of former SDU-Denmark iGEM team participants, we were able to aid the Vilnius University with their very first iGEM team. We intoduced them to techniques for organizing the lab work, how to navigate and use parts registry, how to interpret the iGEM medal recuirements, wiki tips, and important iGEM deadlines.
Figure 2: The silver medal was earned by helping the 2015 iGEM Team from d'Aix Marseille Université by sharing their survey on chewing gum.
While pursuing the goals for our project we collaborated with other iGEM teams and participated in both a Danish and a Nordic Meetup.  The Danish Meetup was hosted by the DTU iGEM Team. This meetup took place the 24th to the 26th of april, where all of the other danish teams participated. The core of this meetup was a biobrick workshop, which took place in the DTU laboratory. This workshop was meant as an introduction for how to build a biobrick. A lot of the team members do nott have much experience with wet lab before iGEM, so this was also a general “how to”-guide for wet lab.  But the meetup also consisted of lectures about ‘How to do - Wiki’ and some cosy social games and a dinner.
The Nordic Jamboree was hosted by the Uppsala iGEM team in collaboration with the Stockholm iGEM Team. This took place at University of Uppsala from the 24th to the 26th of July and a lot of the nordic iGEM teams participated in this event. The main event of this meetup was the Nordic iGEM Jamboree competition, which was held on the 25th. The competition was meant as a chance to practise for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. The winning team of the Nordic Jamboree would receive The Golden Pipette. Other than this the event consisted of workshops, social events, and a dinner saturday evening with a following barcrawl.
After the Nordic Jamboree we were contacted by the Uppsala iGEM team. They needed help to find information on how many teams that had been using antibodies in their projects. This turned out to be a win-win situation, since we could use the data in our Business Plan ). We also helped the 2015 iGEM team from d'Aix Marseille Université by spreading their survey about chewing gum. We earned a silver medal for our efforts.

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
