"If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some." - Alan Perlis
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Figure 1: Petridishes piling up in the lab.
Throughout the project we did a lot of different experiments in the lab. To do this we needed to know what and how to do the these. For this purpose we used standard operating procedures (SOPs). All the SOPs are written by either us or some of the previous SDU iGEM Teams in collaboration with minimum one person with experience in the field of the given procedure. sometimes optimation of these SOPs is necessary, but never without asking a supervisor first. It was hereby secured that all persons was following the same procedures in the lab.
Below is listed all the SOPs used by the 2015 SDU iGEM Team:
SDU iGEM 2015 SOP0001 - Primer design for gene Knock Out (KO) in pathogenic E.coli
SDU iGEM 2015 SOP0002 - ​ON culture of E.coli

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe join a team yourself?
