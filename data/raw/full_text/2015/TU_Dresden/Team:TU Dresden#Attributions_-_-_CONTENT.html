The distribution of the work was done during the first meetings but it changed during the realization of the project according to the needs. Besides the work done by our team, we needed external help to perform some techniques.</P><H4>Arranging finances and finding sponsors</H4><P style="line-height:1.8;">In order to approach our potential sponsors, we created a sponsoring proposal to send around. <B>Bastian</B>, <B>Bo</B> and <B>Carolin</B> took care of sending numerous E-mails and making uncountable calls to companies. At a bonding fare in Dresden <B>Bastian</B>, <B>Bo</B>, <B>Ashwin</B>, and <B>Marvin</B> contacted further companies. We had the opportunity to meet some of the interested institutions. <B>Bastian</B>, <B>Bo</B>, and <B>Sethu</B> attended these meetings representing the whole team. <B>Juliane Hoth</B> from the BIOTEC was responsible to connect our financial platform with the sponsors. Additionally <B>Andrea Dünnebier</B> helped us arranging the flights and accomodation to attend the Giant Jamboree.</P><H4>Wetlab work</H4><OL><LI style="margin-bottom: 10px;line-height:1.8;">Correct folding study of target protein: This subproject involved three people: <B>Sethu</B>, <B>Abhinaya</B>, and <B>Ashwin</B>. The target protein chosen for our project was HER2 and they made the necessary analysis to characterize its structure. <B>Dr. Sofia Traikov</B> from the <B>Hoflack’s lab</B> and <B>Dr. Sivaraman Subramaniam</B> from <B>Stewart's lab</B> (BIOTEC) helped them with the protein purification. In order to perform the circular dichroism spectroscopy we used the help of the <B>Schlierf’s lab</B> (B-Cube).</LI><LI style="margin-bottom: 10px;line-height:1.8;">Investigation of P3 threshold for <I>E. coli</I> resistance: <B>Carolin</B> and <B>Bastian</B> successfully cloned the resistance <I>E. coli</I> needed. This subproject also involved <B>Carl</B> and <B>Robert</B>, who took care of performing the resistance experiments. </LI><LI style="margin-bottom: 10px;line-height:1.8;">Conversion of BACTH into an iGEM standard and analysis of function: <B>Bo</B> was responsible for this subproject. He later converted the BACTH system into an iGEM standard.</LI><LI style="margin-bottom: 10px;line-height:1.8;">Set up of flow system: <B>Carl</B> and <B>Robert</B> got involved in the design of the setup for our project and subprojects.</LI><LI style="margin-bottom: 10px;line-height:1.8;">Biobrick assembly: <B>Marvin</B> cloned the biobricks in the correct plasmid.</LI></OL><H4>Simulations and structure analysis</H4><P style="line-height:1.8;"><B>Melanie</B> was responsible for the bioinformatics part of the project. Therefore she characterized the interaction interface between HER2 and the affibody.</P><H4>Wiki</H4><P style="line-height:1.8;"><B>Romina</B> took care of the designing of the Wiki and organized its content. However all the information needed to fill the necessary sections was distributed between <B>all the team members</B>.</P><H4>Video</H4><P style="line-height:1.8;">We came up with the idea of the video through several improvised sessions of brainstorming. <B>Carolin</B>, <B>Bastian</B>, <B>Bo</B>, <B>Marvin</B>, <B>Sethu</B>, <B>Ashwin</B>, <B>Romina</B>, <B>Carl</B> and <B>Abhinaya</B> recorded the scenes for the video, but the assembly was done by Bo’s sister, <B>Joyna Heinz</B>. Another Heinz, <A style="text-decoration:none;" href="http://avienmusic.com/"><FONT color="#000000"><B>Avien</B></FONT></A> composed the music for the occasion.</P><H4>Acknowledgments</H4><P style="line-height:1.8;">We would like to express our gratitude to everyone who supported us during this experience; to <B>Prof. Thomas Mascher</B>, <B>Robert Braun</B> and <B>Julia Bartels</B> for their advices as iGEM veterans; to <B>Prof. Francis Stewart’s group</B> for providing us with lab space, materials, economical support for the flights of Frank, and for responding every question we had; to Georg Krainer for his help during the CD measurements; to <B>Dr. Jun Fu</B> for this help in the design of the plasmids we needed; to <B>Prof. Thomas Bley</B> for letting us work in his lab and supporting us financially;to <B>PD Dr. Christian Löser</B> for helping us with his knowledge and supplying us with his lab material; to the whole <B>Institute for Food and Bioprocess Engineering</B> for helping us with all our questions and lab work; to <B>Prof. David R. Liu's group </B> from Harvard University for their material supplies; to <A style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.behance.net/Parvathysubramanian/"><B><FONT color="#000000">Parvathy Subramanian</FONT></B></A> for editing the drawings and make them look better.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
