As part of our Cellular Machines course of the Master's in Molecular Bioengineering at the BIOTEC, we gave four talks to present our project to our classmates and professors. Our representatives were Bo, Bastian, and Marvin. Each one of them presented a significant scientific paper fundamental to our project before delving into a detailed description of our project.
Bastian presented the paper from Carlson et al. "Negative selection and stringency modulation in phage-assisted continuous evolution" in order to give a general idea about the PACE system and how it can be used for our purposes. You can find his presentation here .
Following, Bo explained the BACTH system using the paper called "The bacterial two-hybrid system based on adenylate cyclase reconstitution in Escherichia coli". Bo explained the origins of the BACTH system, the general workflow, further applications, as well as the pros and cons of this versatile assay. His presentation is available here .
The last talk was given by Marvin. He presented two papers concerning affibodies: "Affibody molecules: Engineered proteins for therapeutic, diagnostic and biotechnological applications" by LÃ¶fblom et al. and "Structural basis for high-affinity HER2 receptor binding by an engineered protein" by Eigenbrot et al. With the first paper, Marvin explained what affibodies are and the pioneering applications this class of small proteins offers. The second paper described the protein used in our project and its affibody, HER2 and ZHER2, respectively. This last presentation can be found here .
To sum it all up, Bo and Bastian presented our project SPACE-P (Structural Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution of Proteins). They displayed how SPACE-P connects key aspects of PACE, BACTH and affibodies to describe our project. They also introduced iGEM, our team, and further details about collaborators and the general setup of our experiment. Our concept and their presentation can be found here .
