The day before start a 1 mL LB culture with the respective antibiotic when  necessary and incubate at 30 °C (e.g. with pSC101BADaβγA) or 37 °C with 950 rpm o/n .
Place a bottle of sterile water at least for 2 hours on ice.
Start a 1.4 mL LB culture with the respective antibiotic, when necessary with 30 μL of the o/n culture and incubate at 30 °C (e.g. with pSC101BADaβγA) or 37 °C with 950 for 2 hours.
Put the cells on ice.
Keep the cells on ice whenever possible.
Spin the cells down at 8,000 rpm for 0.5 minutes in a cooling centrifuge at 2 °C.
Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice cold water with a pipette.
Spin the cells down at 8,400 rpm for 0.5 minutes at 2 °C.
Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ice cold water with a pipette.
Spin the cells down at 8,800 rpm for 0.5 minutes at 2 °C.
Discard as much supernatant as possible.
The remaining solution should be about 30 μL, resuspend the cells in it.
Use the cells immediately.
