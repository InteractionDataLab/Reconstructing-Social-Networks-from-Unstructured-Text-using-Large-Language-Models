Plasmid Design
All plasmids designed in this section were used as parts for the various subprojects. These plasmids were initially designed to have kanomycin selection marker. These were synthesized from IDT. Below, the plasmid maps of the various parts characterized as for this project can be found.
Please refer to the Parts section for the final updated parts in iGEM Biobrick format.
