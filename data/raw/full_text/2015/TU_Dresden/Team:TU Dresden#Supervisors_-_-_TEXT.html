Supervisors
Our team consists of 11 students and 2 supervisors. Our supervisors were Jana Herrmann and Frank Groß. Here you can read a little bit more about them.
Jana
Jana studied Molecular Biotechnology in Dresden and Munich. From biophysics to biochemistry to chemistry, she has been working on projects in different disciplines. However, her favorite discipline has always been Molecular Bioengineering. Therefore, she is happy to support the TU Dresden team to get SPACE-P into the orbit of iGEM. Being outside the lab, she enjoys the nature while hiking or cycling, and for working off energy – if something is left at the end of a busy week – she likes playing badminton. She says: “The iGEM competition is a great opportunity for the students to get a feeling of what it takes to plan and perform a project (also from the organizational and financial side) and to realize that having know-how is beneficial, but having a good network is as important.”
Frank
Frank studied biology at the Universtät Hohenheim and got his PhD at the Technische Universität Dresden. After three years as a postdoc with Syngenta at the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, he returned to Germany. He is interested in natural products, molecular bioengineering and lately in epigenetics due to group affiliation. “To be asked by the students to supervise the Dresden iGEM team is a honor. It was and is a hard learning process for all of us, since we are all novices in the iGEM hemisphere. But nevertheless, this project is a great opportunity for the students to learn how science is functioning: planning a project, writing proposals to get funding and finally realizing the plans at the bench in the wet lab and present the results.”
