Structure analysis of our targets and their interactions
In order to better understand the interaction between the affibody and HER2, we created a subproject designed specifically for this investigation. As a result, we discovered visual and numerical data and the following model was obtained. In this simulation, the interaction can be observed in a highly detailed manner. To read more about the video and other results we obtained, please refer to Results .
