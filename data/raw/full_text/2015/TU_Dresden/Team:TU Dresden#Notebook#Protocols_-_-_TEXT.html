3 mL of top agar (0.7 %) was prepared with IPTG (0.1 mM final) and X-Gal (40 µg/mL final).
Top agar was hold warm at 42 °C.
200 µL of overnight culture was added.
Phages were added.
LB plate was overlayed with the prepared top agar.
Measurement of the expression of P3 by E. coli co-expressed with CFP
Two cell cultures were cultivated at 37 ° C and at 200 rpm in a shaking incubator for 24 hours.
The optical density (OD) was measured until it had a value of 1.4 for both cultures.
To induce the CFP expression IPTG was added to one of the cultures to a final concentration of 2 mM.
After four hours of induction time samples were taken from the cultures and analyzed in a fluorescence spectrometer
The CFP fluorescence signal of the induced culture should be compared with the signal of the IPTG free culture. CFP can be excited at 439 nm and emits fluorescent light with a wavelength of 476 nm ( BBa_E0020 ).
For the CFP detection both culture samples were set to an OD600 of 1 and measured in the fluorescence spectrometer with the excitation varying from 350 to 450 nm (in steps of 5 nm) and the emission varying from 400 to 500 nm (in steps of 5 nm) leading to a 3D scan of the E. coli fluorescence.
Analysis of the plasmid stability
Take samples every 3 hours together with the ones for the phage infection.
Dilute the samples to a concentration of 10-5 and first plated on a LB plate without chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 °C.
Count the colonies on the next they and transfer them with a stamp to a LB-plate containing chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 °C.
Count the colonies aagain on the next day. Due to the fact that only the colonies containing the plasmid with the antibiotic resistance are able to grow, a ratio of stable cells can be calculated.
Analysis of the phage infection
Use the 10-5 dilution from the plasmid stability to analyze if the phages are washed out during the continuous cultivation and infection in the lagoon.
Plate 100 μL of the sample on a LB-plate containing chloramphenicol and X-Gal.
The infected colonies will turn blue because the phages carry a gen for the galactosidase leading to a blue color production.

Set up of flow system
Continuous stirred-tank cultivation
Fill the bioreactor (1 L Applikon) with 300 mL minimal medium with an OD600 of 0.04.
Inoculate the bioreactor with the medium and stir at 350 rpm and aerate with 5 NL h-1 (synthetic air).
Grow the culture until it reaches an OD600 of 0.2.
Start the continuous cultivation activating the feed pump to supply the reactor with fresh medium (62.5 mL h-1).
The culture is continuously removed from the bioreactor and pumped to the lagoon.
The medium in the bioreactor is set to 250 mL by adjusting the height of the extraction port. With the same principle the volume in the lagoon was set to 63 mL.
The culture in the bioreactor has to pass 2-3 volume changes before it reaches the steady state. In the next step the phages are added to the lagoon.
To ensure that the phages have enough time to regenerate and reproduce, they have 1 hour (1 volume change in the lagoon) without any influence from the inducer.
Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is added to the feed entering the lagoon (IPTG feed 6 mL h-1; final IPTG concentration: 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM).
Increase the IPTG concentration every 3 hours to ensure that the E. coli have at least 1 volume change with the desired IPTG concentration.
