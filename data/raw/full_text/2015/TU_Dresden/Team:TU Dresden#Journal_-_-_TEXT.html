Week 1: (23-30 June)
To check our cell’s transformation efficiency 5 bacteria plates are transformed with different concentrated plasmids(0,5-5-10-20-50 pg/µl)
There was no bacteria mass on plates,this results refer that our bacterias are not good enough foe engineering
Then we prepared new competent cells for our Project and we ordered our primers .
