DNA precipitation
Transfer the DNA into a 1.5 mL tube.
Add 0.1 Vol. of 3 M NaAc to it.
Add 2.5 Vol. of 100 % EtOH or at least 0.6 Vol. 2-propanol and mix.
Incubate at RT for 20 minutes; incubation at -20 °C may improve yield.
Spin down the DNA at 13,200 rpm for 10 minutes.
Discard the ethanol, but be careful not to lose the DNA-pellet.
Carefully add 150 μL 70 % EtOH to the pellet, centrifuge again at 13,200 rpm for 5  min if the pellet is only loosely attached to the wall of the tube.
Either decant or pipette out the 70 % EtOH with the large pipette, then  short spin and then use a pipette with a yellow tip to remove the remaining 70  % EtOH, but be careful not to lose the DNA-pellet .
Dry the pellet for 5-10 min at room temperature, or place the opened tube in a  heating block at 50 °C. Be careful to not over dry the pellet.
Re-dissolve the pellet in 12 μL of water, TE–buffer or 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5.
