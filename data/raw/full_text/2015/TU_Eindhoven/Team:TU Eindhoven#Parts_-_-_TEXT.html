Outer Membrane Protein X (OmpX)
- BBa_K1761000
Quick facts:
Length: 513 bp
Weight: 20kDa
Diameter of the beta barrel: 2 nm
Usage and biology
OmpX, or Outer Membrane Protein X, belongs to a family of highly conserved bacterial proteins that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells. It presents both C- and N-termini in the intracellular domain (see Figure 1). OmpX consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel all-next-neighbor β barrel. The core of the protein consists of an extended hydrogen-bonding network of highly conserved residues (see Figure 1) [1] .
Figure 1: A) The OmpX protein structure has been elucidated through NMR and X-ray crystallography. B) The square residues are important for the secondary structure of OmpX. To keep the structure intact, we introduce an amber stop codon in one of the protruding loops. Figure 1B has been adapted from [1] .
Gene Design
OmpX was identified and characterized by Mecsas et al and is 513 bp long. It contains a putative signal sequence, which makes sure that OmpX will be in the membrane [2] . To be able to use OmpX as a scaffold, you need to integrate the unnatural amino acid. To do so, some modifications must be made to this part. Within the original OmpX part, a codon was mutated into the amber stop codon TAG. This codon will be incorporated in the protruding loops of OmpX, loop 2 and loop 3 (see Figure 1). These loops were chosen because they are easily accessible and are not part of the beta-barrel of OmpX [3] . We believe that mutations in these loops will not disturb the secondary structure of OmpX. With a specific tRNA it is possible to implement a unnatural amino acid at the place of the TAG codon. For more information on which specific mutations we made, see our Project Design page.
To be able to use OmpX in a sensor system, we attached several intracellular domains, namely NanoLuc, mNeonGreen, mTurquoise, LargeBiT and SmallBiT. These domains can interact with each other in different ways. NanoLuc and mNeonGreen form a BRET pair, mTurquoise and mNeonGreen a FRET pair and LargeBiT and SmallBiT a luciferase. These constructs were attached to OmpX with a linker and were inserted in a pETDuet-1 vector that has 2 multiple cloning sites (MCS-1 and MCS-2).
Sequence
The sequence of our OmpX part has been verified by sequencing at StarSeq.

This BioBrick Part looks like Figure 2. It contains the prefix and suffix with the correct restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI). OmpX itself is 513 bp long.
Characterization
When mutated with the amber stop codon TAG, a unnatural amino acid with an azide-functionalized group can be expressed. After the expression of this amino acid, OmpX can covalently bind almost anything, as long as it contains a DBCO-functionalized group. The binding finds place by using a bio-orthogonal “click” reaction (SPAAC click chemistry).
Figure 2: SnapGene figure of the OmpX Part.
To test the functionality of this “click” reaction, some experiments were done by clicking DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA at the surface.  For all the experiments we used the following vectors: pETDuet-1 with one or two construct(s) inserted (OmpX + intracellular protein) and pEVOL-pAzF (tRNA + tRNA synthetase). Both vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3). The expression was introduced by adding arabinose, IPTG and the unnatural amino acid.
DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA Confirmation
To confirm whether OmpX is in the membrane and whether or not the unnatural amino acid is being incorporated into OmpX, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA was used. TAMRA is a fluorescent dye that can be used to verify the “click” reaction. If the unnatural amino acid is present, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA should “click” to the transmembrane protein OmpX and stay there. This can be analyzed with FACS. For more information about how to perform FACS experiments, see our Protocol Page .
To verify that OmpX is in the membrane, we used the OmpX – NanoLuc and OmpX – mNeonGreen constructs. These gave the following results after clicking with DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA (see Figure 3 and 4). From this it can be concluded that OmpX is in the membrane and that the “click” reaction works.

Outer Membrane Protein X (OmpX) with BamHI-linker and mNeonGreen
- BBa_K1761001
Quick facts:
Total length: 1439 bp
BamHI-linker length: 213 bp
mNeongreen length: 711 bp
Weight: 53kDa
Usage and biology
OmpX, or Outer Membrane Protein X, belongs to a family of highly conserved bacterial proteins that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells. It presents both C- and N-termini in the intracellular domain (see Figure 5). OmpX consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel all-next-neighbor β barrel. The core of the protein consists of an extended hydrogen-bonding network of highly conserved residues (see Figure 5) [4] .
Figure 5: A) The OmpX protein structure has been elucidated through NMR and X-ray crystallography. B) The square residues are important for the secondary structure of OmpX. To keep the structure intact, we introduce an amber stop codon in one of the protruding loops. Figure 5B is adapted from [4] .
mNeonGreen is a yellow-green fluorescent protein and is derived from a tetrameric fluorescent protein from cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum. mNeonGreen is the brightest monomeric green or yellow fluorescent protein yet described and is an excellent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor for the newest cyan fluorescent proteins [5] .
Gene Design
This construct consists of three parts, namely OmpX, a BamHI-linker, and mNeonGreen. OmpX is already described as a single part, and that same part, with the amber stop codon TAG incorporated for the integration of the unnatural amino acid, is used for this construct. For more information, see our Part OmpX .  mNeonGreen is connected to OmpX with a BamHI-linker. This linker is a 213 bp long flexible GGSGGS linker and by using the restriction enzyme BamHI, the linker can become 45 bp shorter. mNeonGreen was characterized by Shaner et al [5] . The BamHI-linker is inspired by the article of T.H. Evers et al [6] .
Figure 6: Schematical overview of the OmpX – mNeonGreen Part.
These three parts together give a construct with OmpX as transmembrane protein
and mNeonGreen as intracellular domain
(see Figure 6)
For all our experiments we used pETDuet-1 as a vector. This vector has two multiple cloning sites, namely MCS-1 and MCS-2. To be able to use this part as a sensor, we inserted both OmpX – NanoLuc and OmpX – mNeonGreen into this vector, both in different multiple cloning sites. Both multiple cloning sites were expressed. In this way, NanoLuc and mNeonGreen can function as a BRET pair (see Figure 7).

This BioBrick Part looks like Figure 8. It contains the prefix and suffix with the correct restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI). OmpX is 513 bp long, the BamHI-Linker is 213 bp long and mNeonGreen 711 bp.
Characterization
When mutated with the amber stop codon TAG, OmpX can covalently bind anything by using a bio-orthogonal “click” reaction. The presence of mNeonGreen in this construct is tested with a fluorescence assay.
Figure 8: SnapGene figure of the OmpX – mNeonGreen Part.
For all the experiments we used the following vectors: pETDuet-1 with a construct inserted (OmpX + intracellular protein) and pEVOL-pAzF (tRNA + tRNA synthetase). Both vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3). The expression was introduced by adding arabinose, IPTG and the unnatural amino acid.
DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA Confirmation
To confirm whether OmpX is in the membrane and whether or not the unnatural amino acid is being incorporated into OmpX, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA was used. TAMRA is a fluorescent dye that can be used to verify the “click” reaction.
If the unnatural amino acid is present, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA should “click” to the transmembrane protein OmpX and stay there. This can be analyzed with FACS. OmpX – mNeonGreen gave the following results after clicking with DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA (see Figure 9). From this it can be concluded that OmpX is in the membrane and that the “click” reaction works.

For more information about how to perform FACS experiments, see our Protocol Page .
Fluorescence Confirmation
To confirm whether mNeonGreen is present in the bacteria, a fluorescence assay was performed. Excitation took place at a wavelength of 480 nm with a laser. Emission was read out at 517 nm. From this experiment, it can be concluded that mNeonGreen is present and works (see Figure 10).

Outer Membrane Protein X (OmpX) with BsoBI-linker and NanoLuc
- BBa_K1761002
Quick facts:
Total length: 1241 bp
BsoBI-linker length: 213 bp
NanoLuc length: 513 bp
Weight: 46 kDa
Usage and biology
OmpX, or Outer Membrane Protein X, belongs to a family of highly conserved bacterial proteins that promote bacterial adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells. It presents both C- and N-termini in the intracellular domain (see Figure 11). OmpX consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel all-next-neighbor β barrel. The core of the protein consists of an extended hydrogen-bonding network of highly conserved residues (see Figure 11) [7] .
Figure 11: A) The OmpX protein structure has been elucidated through NMR and X-ray crystallography, B) The square residues are important for the secondary structure of OmpX. To keep the structure intact, we introduce an amber stop codon in one of the protruding loops. Figure 11B is adapted from [7] .
NanoLuc is a small sized and bright luciferase protein engineered for optimal performance as a bioluminescent reporter. The small size and bright luminescence bring exquisite sensitivity to reporter assays and other bioluminescence applications. The luciferase naturally occurs in the organism Oplophorus gracilirostis.
Gene Design
This construct consists of three parts, namely OmpX, a BsoBI-linker, and NanoLuc. OmpX is already described as a single part, and that same part, with the amber stop codon TAG incorporated for the integration of the unnatural amino acid, is used for this construct. For more information, see our Part OmpX .
Between OmpX and mNeonGreen we inserted a BsoBI-linker. This is a 213 bp long flexible GGSGGS-linker with two BsoBI-restriction sites. These sites give the possibility to shorten the linker with 45 bp. The BsoBI-linker is inspired by the article "Quantitative Understanding of the Energy Transfer between Fluorescent Proteins Connected via Flexible Peptide Liners" by T.H. Evers et al from 29 August 2006 [8] . These three parts together give a construct with OmpX as transmembrane protein
and NanoLuc as intracellular domain
(see Figure 12).
Figure 12: Schematical overview of the OmpX – NanoLuc Part.
For all our experiments we used pETDuet-1 as a vector. This vector has two multiple cloning sites, namely MCS-1 and MCS-2. To be able to use this part as a sensor, we inserted both OmpX – NanoLuc and OmpX – mNeonGreen into this vector, both in different multiple cloning sites. Both multiple cloning sites were expressed. In this way, NanoLuc and mNeonGreen can function as a BRET pair (see Figure 13).

Characterization
When mutated with the amber stop codon TAG, OmpX can covalently bind anything by using a bio-orthogonal “click” reaction. The presence of NanoLuc in this construct can be tested by adding furimazine and read out its emission spectrum. If it is present, there should be a maximum around 460 nm.

mNeongreen
- BBa_K1761003
Quick facts:
Length: 711 bp
Weight: 28kDa
Figure 17: mNeonGreen.
Usage and biology
mNeonGreen is a yellow-green fluorescent protein and is derived from a tetrameric fluorescent protein from cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum (see Figure X). It is the brightest monomeric green of yellow fluorescent protein yet described and is an excellent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor for the newest cyan fluorescent proteins [9] .
Gene Design
mNeonGreen was characterized by Shaner et al [9] . We inserted mNeonGreen in the pETDuet-1 vector together with OmpX and a BamHI-linker (see Figure 18). This linker is a 213 bp long flexible GGSGGS linker and by using the restriction enzyme BamHI, the linker can become 45 bp shorter. The BamHI-linker is inspired by the article "Quantitative Understanding of the Energy Transfer between Fluorescent Proteins Connected via Flexible Peptide Liners" by T.H. Evers et al from 29 August 2006 [10] .

This BioBrick Part looks like Figure 3. It contains the prefix and suffix with the correct restriction sites (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI). mNeonGreen is 711 bp long.
Characterization
mNeonGreen was characterized mNeonGreen by fusing it to an outer membrane protein (see below) as well as by expressing it on itself in the cytosol. For the expression of mNeonGreen in the cytosol, mNeonGreen was inserted after the constitutive promotor J23101. Even though no RBS was introduced into the composite part, the cells still showed fluorescence which could be measured with the Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer for both an in vivo excitation scan and a in vivo emission scan.

Split Luciferase
Another intracellular domain we used is a split luciferase. This split luciferase consists of two parts, namely LargeBit and SmallBit. We inserted these two parts both in a pETDuet-1 vector together with OmpX. LargeBit and SmallBit have an affinity towards each other, so when in close proximity they will come together and will give a luminescence signal. Followed is a short description of each part and of the NanoBit construct.
OmpX - LargeBit BBa_K1761005
LargeBit is the big part of this Split Luciferase. Its molecular weight is 18 kDa. OmpX (1) (with a correct mutation for the amber stop codon TAG), a BamHI-linker and LargeBit (2) together will look like Figure 1. This construct on its own has no function since LargeBit on itself has no luminescence activity.
*Sequence will be published later
Figure 1: Schematical overview of the OmpX - LargeBit construct..
OmpX-SmallBit BBa_K1761006
SmallBit is the small part of this Split Luciferase. Its molecular weight is 1 kDa, it is only 11 amino acids long. OmpX (1) (with a correct mutation for the amber stop codon TAG), a BsoBI-linker and SmallBit (2) together will look like Figure 2. This construct on its own has no function since SmallBit on itself has no luminescence activity. * Sequence will be published later.
NanoBit construct
NanoBit utilizes a structural complementation-based approach to monitor protein interactions within living cells. Protein interaction promotes structural complementation and generation of a bright, luminescent enzyme. Protein dynamics can be followed in real-time in living cells following addition of the Nano-Glo Live Cell Reagent, a non-lytic detection reagent containing the cell-permeable furamizine substrate. See Figure 3 for the whole construct.
Figure 2: Schematical overview of the NanoBit construct.
Characterization
When mutated with the amber stop codon TAG, a non-natural amino acid with an azide-functionalized group can be expressed. After the expression of this amino acid, OmpX can covalently bind almost anything, as long as it contains a DBCO-functionalized group. The binding finds place by using a bio-orthogonal “click” reaction (SPAAC chemistry). To test the functionality of this “click” reaction, some experiments were done by clicking DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA at the surface.
For all the experiments we used the following vectors: pETDuet-1 with one or two construct(s) inserted (OmpX + intracellular protein) and pEVOL-pAzF (tRNA + tRNA synthetase). Both vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3). The expression was introduced by adding arabinose, IPTG and the non-natural amino acid.
DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA click & bioluminiscence confirmation
To confirm whether OmpX is in the membrane and whether or not the non-natural amino acid is being incorporated into OmpX, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA was used. TAMRA is a fluorescent dye that can be used to verify the “click” reaction. If the non-natural amino acid is present, DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA should “click” to the transmembrane protein OmpX and stay there. This can be analyzed with FACS. For more information about how to perform FACS experiments, see our Protocol Page .
To verify that OmpX is in the membrane, we used the OmpX – LgBiT and OmpX – SmBiT constructs. These gave the following results after clicking with DBCO-PEG4-TAMRA (see Figure 3 and 4). From this it can be concluded that OmpX is in the membrane and that the “click” reaction works.
