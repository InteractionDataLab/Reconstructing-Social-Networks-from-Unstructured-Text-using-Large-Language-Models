iGEM is the worldâ€™s leading competition in the field of Synthetic Biology. We are the fourth iteration of TU Eindhoven students taking part in this awesome competition. Inspired by Eindhoven's last year's results and the exciting field of SynBio, we are driven to set the bar high with an innovative idea.
