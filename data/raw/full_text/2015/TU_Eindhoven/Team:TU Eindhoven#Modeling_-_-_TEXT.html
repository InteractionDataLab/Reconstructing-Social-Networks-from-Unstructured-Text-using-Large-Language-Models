Dig Deeper
See how we conceptually modelled our biosensor.
Next Chapter
Find out what results we obtained over the summer.
Modeling
Modeling provides an easy way to test the concept of our biosensor. By simulating our sensor, we can obtain more insight on how it behaves in many different situations.
Modeling Approach
Information on what was modeled and what choices
were made
The script
Check out how our models handles input and output. The used parameters are discussed here too and the model can be downloaded
Modeling Results
The results of the model are discussed here
