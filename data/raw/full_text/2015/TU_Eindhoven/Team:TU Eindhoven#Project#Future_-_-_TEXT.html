If the system is proven to be stable, a TEV-protease  can be used to release transcription factors in the presence of specific protein. TEV-proteases cleave a specific amino acid sequence, which we use to connect a transcription factor to a second OmpX . When the transcription factor is cleaved, it can start a signaling cascade. The advantage of TEV-protease is that one has a wide range of uses, since it can activate genes. This adaptability, however, comes at a cost; the process reacts a bit slower than the split luciferase approach.
