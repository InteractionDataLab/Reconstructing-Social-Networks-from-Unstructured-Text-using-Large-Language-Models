Timeline
Somewhere in the beginning of July, we started our wetwork. We started the summer off working in smaller teams: we had a team working on Gibson Assembly, a team responsible for Traditional Cloning and a team working on Interlab. In this way, we could fit tons of wetwork within the few weeks of the summer holidays. Below, we hope to give a short overview of how we started off and which experiments we carried out in which weeks.
See the black timeline below for a global impression of the major experiments carried out by the teams working with Gibson Assembly and Traditional cloning. These experiments brougth us were we are today and results can be seen here .
Week 26
- Preparing for take-off
Inventory of the lab supplies
Pouring LB Agar plates
Amplification of the pET-Duet-1 vector
Assessment of the safety requirements
Preparing stocks for antibiotics, glycerol, LB & MilliQ
Week 27
- The clone wars
Gibson Assembly:
Linearizing MCS-1 of pET-Duet-1 for Gibson Assembly
Digestion of the template using DpnI
Running a gel to check whether the linearization was successful
Our first Gibson Assembly!
Plasmid amplification into NEB 5-alpha
Traditional cloning:
Amplification of the pET-Duet-1 vector
Nde1 & Kpn1 digestion of the pET-Duet-1 vector (MCS-2) for traditional cloning
Week 28
- Et tu, pET-Duet?
Gibson Assembly:
Linearizing MCS-1 of pET-Duet-1 for Gibson Assembly and debugging: sequencing results came back disastrous. It seemed as if pETDuet-1 had turned on us. In the end, however, it turned out that we had used the wrong primers. Always use the right primers, folks!
Digestion of the template using DpnI
Running a gel to check whether the linearization was successful
Gibson Assembly for MCS-1
Plasmid amplification into NEB 5-alpha
Traditional cloning:
Amplification of the inserts
Xbal & Pstl digestion of the pET-Duet-1 vector (MCS-1)
Xba1 & Pst1 digestion of the inserts (MCS-1)
Nde1 & Kpn1 digestion of the inserts (MCS-2)
Ligation
Transformation in NB
Colony PCR & gel electrophorese: The inserts are succesfully ligated
Culturing of the colonies with the correct plasmid
Making a glycerol stock & sending the DNA for sequencing
Week 29
- Hopeful results
Gibson Assembly:
Plasmid isolation, followed by sequencing of the insert on MCS-1
Linearization of the vector on MCS-2
Gibson Assembly of MCS-2
Plasmid amplification into NEB 5-alpha
Colony PCR of MCS-2, showing promising results!
Culturing and preparing for protein expression
Protein expression:
Double transformation of pET-Duet-1 (MCS1) and pEVOL in BL21.
Culturing & making a glycerol stock
Traditional cloning:
The sequencing results are positive, everything is built in correctly.
Week 30
- The moment of truth
Gibson Assembly:
Plasmid isolation, followed by sequencing of the insert on MCS-2
Protein expression of the plasmids containing MCS-1:
Culturing and protein expression of MCS-1 containing pET-Duet-1 vector
Labelling the bacteria with DBCO-PEG4-Tamra
FACS results don't show the click reaction...
Double transformation & protein expression of the plasmids containing MCS-1 & MCS-2:
Double transformation, culturing and protein expression of pET-Duet-1 (MCS-1 & MCS-2)
The click reaction occured according to FACS results
Traditional cloning
The vector which already contained MCS-1 is digested at MCS-2
Ligation of vector & insert. This results in a plasmid containing MCS-1 (OmpX-NanoLuc) and MCS-2 (OmpX-neongreen)
Week 31
- Busy times
Gibson Assembly:
Succesfull double transformation of 12.2 at 20 ng/uL (rather than 4)
Gibson Assembly, Colony PCR and transformation of mNeonGreen into MCS-1
FACS:
Protein expression of bacteria containing MCS-1 and bacteria containing MCS-1 & MCS-2
FACS (labelling bacteria with DBCO-PEG4-tamra) shows a click reaction with bacteria containing MCS-1 & MCS-2. No click reaction occurs with bacteria containing only MCS-1.
Traditional Cloning:
Transform of the newly created plasmid MCS-1 (OmpX-NanoLuc) and MCS-2 (OmpX-neongreen)
