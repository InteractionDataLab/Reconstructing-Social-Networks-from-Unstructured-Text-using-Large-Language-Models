Results Over the course of the summer, we worked our socks off on our iGEM project. The fruits of our hard work are presented here. We have characterized and contributed 3 new parts to the Registry. In addition to the parts we have already contributed, we will be contributing the exciting new NanoBiT split luciferase to the registry as soon as Promega publishes the sequence. These parts were vital for our two COMB prototypes, which we have succesfully characterized. We also submitted these two prototypes as two composite parts to the registry, expanding the Registry with five new parts. Finally, we have joined and finalized the second annual Interlab Study. For more information on each of these results, follow one of the links below!
