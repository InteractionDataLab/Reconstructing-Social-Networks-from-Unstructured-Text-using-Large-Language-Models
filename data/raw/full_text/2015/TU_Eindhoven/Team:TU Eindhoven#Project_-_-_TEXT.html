Clickable Outer Membrane Biosensors (COMBs)
- An aptamer-based approach to a universal and modular biosensor platform
Ground-breaking drug discoveries are at the forefront of society. The success rate of curing, however, highly depends on an accurate and early diagnosis of disease
.
An illustrating example is intestinal cancer. The survival rate of patients diagnosed with intestinal cancer in the early stage is 90%, whereas the survival rate of patients diagnosed in the critical stage is a meagre 13% [1] . An accurate and early diagnosis saves lives.
An approach to diagnose disease is through the use of analytical instruments. Even though these instruments provide rich information which can lead to sound diagnoses, analytical instruments suffer from long processing and waiting times, as samples often need to be pre-treated and the instruments are frequently occupied. To overcome the long processing and waiting times, biosensors have been developed. These biosensors can be used on-site and are easy-to-use, but a universal approach in these biosensors is lacking. That is where we come in, as we have developed a universal membrane sensor platform for biosensors, which we call Clickable Outer Membrane Biosensors (COMBs).
Project Description
We dive a little deeper into the concept of COMBs in our Project Description. Click this image to read it!
COMBs
COMBs are the backbone of the modular biosensor platform we designed. Click this image to read more on COMBs.
Expression System
Read how we obtain bacteria expressing our non-natural COMBs here.
Experimental Approach
To test the viability of our COMBs, we have designed a few experiments. An overview of these experiments is shown on this page.
Protocols
All the protocols we have used during our iGEM Project are listed on this page. These include cloning protocols but also protocols for our experiments.
Timeline
During the iGEM competition, teams conduct research in a very limited timeframe. Visit this page to read how we managed to squeeze all wetwork in our summer.
