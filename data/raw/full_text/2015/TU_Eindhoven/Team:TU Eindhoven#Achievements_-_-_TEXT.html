Achievements
The TU Eindhoven team of 2015 has won a golden medal and has won the award for the Best Innovation in Measurement! The team was also nominated for the Best New Appliation Project award, as well as the Best Education and Public Engagement award.
Bronze Medal
We have registered our iGEM Team , had a great summer and plan to have a great time at the Giant Jamboree.
We have completed and submitted our Judging Form.
We have created and shared a description of our project using our Wiki and our parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We will be presenting a poster and will be holding a talk at the Giant Jamboree.
We have documented our Attributions and have given short descriptions of the roles of our Team Members .
We have documented four new BioBricks. One example is: BBa_K1761001.
Silver Medal
We have experimentally validated four of our BioBricks. In addition to the first part described under the Bronze Medal requirements, three more parts have been registered in the main page section of the new registry entry. These parts are: BBa_K1761000 , BBa_K1761002 and BBa_K1761003.
We have submitted each of these parts to the iGEM registry.
We scrutinized three possible application scenarios and contacted many stakeholders to resolve problems concerning ethics, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. For the educational outreach part we have talked to policy officers, but also to students and laypeople, and involved them into in discussions about synthetic biology. Check this out at our Policy & Practices section.
Gold Medal
We have taken our Human Practices activity to the next level by co-organizing a Synthetic Biology conference. This conference was a public event where several ministers joined for a discussion about synthetic biology.
We have hosted a collaboration which included 16 teams from 8 different countries. As part of this collaboration, we compiled a cloning guide in which we help future iGEM teams in choosing an appropriate cloning method for their project.
We have improved the application of Nanoluc part BBa_K1159001 . This part has been used to compile a BRET sensor together with mNeonGreen. NanoLuc was attached to the Outer Membrane Protein X (OmpX) and the BRET system has been used and characterized inside the E. coli bacteria.
