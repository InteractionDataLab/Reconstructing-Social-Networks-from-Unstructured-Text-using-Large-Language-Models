Amoy Newsletter
</H2><SPAN class="tekst1"> 
This year, we have taken part in the biweekly newsletter hosted by <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Amoy" target="_blank"> iGEM Amoy</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt" target="_blank">iGEM Paris Bettencourt</A> and <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris" target="_blank">iGEM Pasteur</A>. The newsletter presents projects of participating iGEM teams and focuses on topics interesting for Synthetic Biology. So far, special themes of the newsletter have been the controversial use of CRISPR to modify human embryos, software programs and the state of SynBio in many different countries. Check them out below!
<UL class="activiteitlijst"><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 1 - How to set up and operate an iGEM team.
<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler1"><DIV class="newsletterText">
This issue of the Newsletter was aimed at future iGEM teams. To this end, the Newsletter gives iGEM teams room to describe the composition of their team and how their team is operated. This includes which teachers and students guide the team throughout the competition, from which department the team members originate and how to overcome difficulties. We contributed to this issue by describing the composition of our team, the distribution of team roles as well as making jokes about pizza.
</DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 2 - Project introductions and ethical discussions.
<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler2"><DIV class="newsletterText">
The second issue of the newsletter was set to be published two weeks after Chinese scientists had succesfully used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the human genome. Sparked by the outcry within the scientific community, the newsletter gave room for ethical discussions on the subject. In addition to the ethical viewpoints from different iGEM teams from all over the world, the newsletter gave room for some iGEM teams to present their projects.
</DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 3 - Show our projects.

<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler3"><DIV class="newsletterText">
The third issue of newsletter gave room to iGEM teams to present their projects. This issue contains project descriptions from teams from South America, Asia, Europe and Northern-America, targeting problems like lung cancer, malnourishment and bee &amp; bat pathogens.
</DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 4 (special) - The development of synthetic biology in different countries.
<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler4"><DIV class="newsletterText">
For the fourth newsletter, Amoy asked contributing times to describe the development of Synthetic Biology in their home countries. The guide features among others pieces on synthetic biology in Canada, France, Honduras, Slovenia &amp; the US. For this piece, we assessed synthetic biology efforts within the Netherlands, describing the National Institute for Public Health and Environment, the Rathenau Institute and the Dutch multinational DSM. It seems that even though synthetic biology has sparked great interest from the public internationally, much bars still need to be cleared for it to be able to deliver on its promise. 
</DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 5 - Project update and three new parts.
<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler5"><DIV class="newsletterText">
The fifth issue of newsletter was dedicated to the projects. We contributed to the issue by giving a short and a little dated description of our project. In addition to this description, we placed a call for contributors to our cloning guide.
</DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="activiteit">
Amoy newsletter issue 6 - Special Issue: Software.
<DIV class="spoiler" id="spoiler6"><DIV class="newsletterText">
The sixth issue of the newsletter was a special issue centered around software different teams are using within their iGEM project. We contributed to the guide by giving an overview of the software packages we were using as well as short descriptions of these packages.

PenPal
</H2><SPAN class="tekst1"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary" target="_blank">Team William and Mary</A> has set up a PenPal application where different teams with the same interested were linked to each other. Our team was matched with <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Concordia" target="_blank">Concordia</A> as we were both working with membrane proteins. Through this PenPal match we have reached out to them and a brief discussion about both our projects has been taking place.

During the project we received an e-mail from <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:York" target="_blank">iGEM team York</A>. They were performing an investigation on the drinking water across different countries in the world. They wanted to determine the phosphate levels in water in different countries. To help them two different samples of 50ml H2O were taken. One sample was drawn from a kitchen water tap, the other was taken from a water tap outside. The pH of these samples was determined with the use of a pH meter. After the pH was taken they were filtered and send to York. Curious about their results? Check it our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:York/Collaborations" target="_blank">here</A> .

Interview
</H2><SPAN class="tekst1"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:NAIT_Edmonton" target="_blank">Team NAIT_Edmonton</A> has started a collaboration with teams from the track New Application. The purpose of their collaboration was to enquire teams on their process during this iGEM competition. They tried to investigate what problems teams ran into and how these problems were solved. To help them in their research we have agreed to do a skype interview. During this interview we discussed both ours and their project and how we  have overcome some troubles. Curious about their results? Check it our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:NAIT_Edmonton/Collaborations">here</A>.
