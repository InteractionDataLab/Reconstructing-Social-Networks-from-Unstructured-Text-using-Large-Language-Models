The Team
Meet the team
We are a group of 11 enthusiastic and motivated undergraduate students from Eindhoven University of Technology. Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is a research university specializing in engineering science & technology. The university focuses on science for society, science for industry and science for science. Strategic areas on which the TU/e is focussing are Energy, Health and Smart Mobility.
Inspired by the great achievement of last year’s iGEM team (Winner of the “Best new application project”, undergrad) and eager to explore the field of synthetic biology, we are driven to set the bar high with an innovative and socially relevant idea. If you want to find out more about the individual members, take a look at our very own memory by clicking on the image!
