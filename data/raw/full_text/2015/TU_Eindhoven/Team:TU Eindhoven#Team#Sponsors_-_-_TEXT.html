We would like to thank to following cooperations and organizations for helping us with our project:
ICMS
The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) provided us with funding. The ICMS combines mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and engineering to stimulate education and research of complex molecular systems. Their mission is to become the leading international multidisciplinary institute for research and education in this field of research. To achieve this they perform top research in complex molecular systems, train talented young scientists, organize interdisciplinary science activities and provide an advanced study center. For more information visit the ICMS Website .
Pamm
PAMM foundation supported us financially. PAMM foundation is a research center for medical microbiology and infectious diseases and for pathology in Veldhoven en Eindhoven, the Netherlands. They collaborate with general practicioners and hospitals in the region, the Dutch national health institutes (GGD) and health facilities. As a prominent research institute, PAMM values innovation in its research field and is working on diagnostics, consultation and prevention of diseases. For more information visit the PAMM Website .
Department of Biomedical Engineering
The Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Technology Eindhoven provides high-quality academic education and cutting-edge research. Open and personal contact between the 500 students, 100 PhD students and 70 researchers results in synergy of education and research.  They offer academic programs at several levels: bachelor, master and PhD programs, which integrate natural sciences and engineering disciplines with biology and pathophysiology. Research groups within the department cover subjects from regenerative medicine to biomedical image analysis to biomolecular engineering. For more information visit the Department of Biomedical Engineering Website .
UFe
The Universiteitsfonds supported us financially. The Universiteitsfonds supports the University in education, research and culture by helping fund activities which otherwise would not be possible to realize. For more information visit the UFe Website.
DSM
DSM provided us with a substantial sum to continue our lab work. DSM looks from a scientific point of view to health, nutrition and materials. They connect these fields to come up with new innovative ideas to improve economic welfare, the environment and public welfare. For more information visit the DSMWebsite .
EuropaBio
EuropaBio, the European Association for Bioindustries, promotes an innovative and dynamic European biotechnology industry. EuropaBio and its members are committed to the socially responsible use of biotechnology to improve quality of life, to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure diseases, to improve the quality and quantity of food and feedstuffs and to move towards a biobased and zero-waste economy. EuropaBio represents 77 corporate and associate members and bio regions, and 16 national biotechnology associations in turn representing over 1800 biotech SMEs. Visit the EuropaBio Website for more information.
SnapGene
SnapGene provided us with free licenses of their software. We used SnapGene to design and analyze our constructs. SnapGene created software for researchers to make cloning procedures easier, enabling researchers to better plan their cloning procedures. We found SnapGene to be extremely satisfying tool, since it combines a gentle learning curve with a wide range of resources. For more information visit the SnapGene Website .
Promega
Promega is a global leader in providing innovative solutions and technical support to life scientist in academic, industrial and government settings. The company is a manufacturer of enzymes and other products for biotechnology and molecular biology with a portfolio covering the fields of genomics, protein analysis and expression, cellular analysis, drug discovery and genetic identity. Promega has generously provided us with DNA constructs. For more information visit the Promega Website.
New England Biolabs
NEB is a leader in the discovery and development of recombinant and native enzymes for genomic research. These enzymes include restriction enzymes and endonucleases. The company is a major supplier of reagents for the life sciences research. New England Biolabs has generously offered all teams participating the iGEM competition of 2015 cloning kits, DNA ladders and polymerases. For more information, visit the NEB Website.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
IDT is generously offering 20 kb of DNA as gBlocksÂ® Gene Fragments free of charge to each iGEM 2015 team. We used these highly versatile and affordable Gene Fragments for Gibson Assembly. For more information visit the IDT Website.
