Safety
Safety is a very important part of projects in synthetic biology. Whether you are working in the lab, designing your constructs or writing protocols, safety is always just around the corner and needs to be kept in mind all the time. In order to manage the safety part of the iGEM project, we did several things: lab rules were mastered, MSDS sheets have been sought and the ins and outs concerning the applications of our project were worked out.
