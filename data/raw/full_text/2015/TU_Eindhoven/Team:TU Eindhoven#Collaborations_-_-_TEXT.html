Collaborations
The openness of the iGEM competition leads to an educational and competitive environment which stimulates the advancement of synthetic biology. These collaborations are formed between teams from all over the world, who can help each other carry out their projects. It also enables teams to collaborate with each other to make synthetic biology more accessible and bring it even further.
To make new cloning techniques a little more accessible, we started off compiling a cloning guide for future iGEM teams. For this guide, we were assisted by 14 teams who helped describe 9 different molecular cloning techniques. In addition, we joined other collaborations, such as the Amoy Newsletter, sending out water to York, being a PenPal, having an interview with NAIT_Edmonton and joining a symposium in Leuven. For more information on these collaborations, follow one of the links below.
Our Cloning Guide
We made a Cloning Guide which will help future generation iGEM teams with choosing a cloning method. With the help of 16 iGEM teams we formed a cloning guide with crucial knowledge and experience based tips on 9 different cloning methods.
Collaboration Attributions
Besides hosting our own collaboration we tried to help out other teams where we could. For an overview of other collaborations we joined, visit our attributions page.
