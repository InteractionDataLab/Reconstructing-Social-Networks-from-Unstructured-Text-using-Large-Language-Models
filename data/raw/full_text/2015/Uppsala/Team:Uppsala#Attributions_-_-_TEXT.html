It would have been difficult for us as students to come this far on the road to Boston without the following people who have helped us in many ways. We would like to thank each and every one for their support, guidance and encouragement.
Advisors
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and the director of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders primarily studies enzymes involved in regulating fate and function of the plethora of RNA molecules in the cell. Another goal of his is to develop novel antibiotics targeting RNA molecules. He has been our supervisor and a course administrator for the university course related to our project.
Gunnar Johansson
Gunnar Johansson is a professor in Biochemistry at Uppsala University. His research focuses on enzyme nanotechnology and sustainable materials technology based on biomass. Gunnar has been at our brainstorming sessions in the beginning of our project and provided his suggestions and advice on the feasibility of our project. He has helped us by providing chemicals and protocols for chromatographic techniques, sonication and SDS-PAGE.
Mikael Nissbeck
PhD student at Uppsala RNA Research Center (URRC), Department of Cell and Molecular biology, at Uppsala University since 2012 and is currently working with the human enzyme Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) in the Anders Virtanen group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center. Mikael has provided us with help and guidance when we had problem with protocols and in obtaining good results. He also assisted us with ordering primers, enzymes and reagents.
Sethu Madhava Rao Gunja
Research Assistant at Chemical Biology group, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology in Uppsala University since 2012 and is currently working on Physiological characterisation of human enzyme Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) in the Anders Virtanen group at the Uppsala Biomedical Center. Sethu has provided us with help and guidance over the methods that were used, specifically vacuum centrifugation and TLC.  He also assisted us with ordering enzymes and reagents.
Anthony Forster
Anthony Forster is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). He is researching synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery and is currently working towards the synthesis of a minimal cell. Anthony has provided us with valuable feedback and guidance during our initial meetings.
