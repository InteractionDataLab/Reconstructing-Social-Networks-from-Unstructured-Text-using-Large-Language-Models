   The aim of our group was to make a synthetic system in <I>Escherichia coli</I> expressing mono-rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipids are biosurfactants that can be used for improving bioavailability of PAHs. (Chen <I>et al</I>. 2013). PAHs, that we attempt to break down, tend to cluster due to their hydrophobic properties. The bioavailability of PAHs increases in the presence of rhamnolipids, improving their degradation by the enzymes laccase and dioxygenase. 3A assembly was used to assemble the genes <I>rhlA</I> and <I>rhlB</I> responsible for the mono-rhamnolipid production together with RBSs and a promoter. Assembly steps were verified by Sanger-sequencing. Different assays were used to verify the production of rhamnolipids in our system, among others drop collapse test, CTAB test and thin layer chromatography. The results indicated the presence of rhamnolipids.
  </P><H2>Introduction</H2><P>
  Breaking down PAHs extracellularly is problematic since they aggregate into clusters due to their hydrophobic properties and the efficiency of the enzymes laccase and dioxygenase will drop dramatically due to this. To counteract these cluster formations our strain of Escherichia coli will produce biosurfactants, namely mono-rhamnolipids, figure 1. This biosurfactant is made up of a hydrophilic rhamnose head and a 3-(hydroxyalkanoyloxy) alkanoic acid (HAA) fatty acid tail which can vary in length (Han <I>et al</I>. 2014). The mono-rhamnolipid will interact with and disperse the aggregated PAHs, increasing the efficiency of the enzymes that eventually will break down the PAHs.

  </FIGCAPTION><P>
  Using biosurfactants to disperse hydrophobic compounds is nothing new. Many microorganisms use biosurfactants to access carbon that would otherwise be unavailable to them. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the best characterized organisms that produces rhamnolipids (Oschner <I>et al</I>. 1995). Besides mono-rhamnolipids they also produce di-rhamnolipids which has two hydrophilic rhamnose heads (Moussa <I>et al</I>. 2014). These are not as good at dispersing hydrophilic compounds and will not be expressed in this project.
  </P><P>
  The enzymes responsible for producing the mono-rhamnolipids are called RhlA and RhlB. These make up the subunits of rhamnosyltransferase I and are organized in an operon for highest efficiency. The RhlA creates the fatty acid tail and the RhlB connects the tail to a rhamnose molecule. (Han <I>et al</I>. 2014) The genes that express these enzymes are labeled rhlA and rhlB and both of these genes were already present in the iGEM distribution kit. To express the genes a promoter was added together with RBSs at the sites needed, all added using 3A assembly.
  </P><P>
  To detect the mono-rhamnolipids a few assays were used. Drop-collapsing tests were used to confirm the presence of biosurfactants and CTAB plating were used to confirm that rhamnolipids were produced. Finally to confirm them as mono-rhamnolipids a TLC and mass spectrometry was conducted.
  </P><H2>System design</H2><P>
  For our project we wanted a system that only expressed mono-rhamnolipids, see gene construct, figure 2. Biobricks (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1331001"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1331001</SPAN></A>) <I>(rhlA)</I> and (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1331004"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1331004</SPAN></A>) <I>(rhlB)</I> encode for enzymes Rhl A and Rhl B which together makes up rhamnosyltransferase I and are responsible for biosynthesis of mono-rhamnolipids. A constitutive Anderson promoter was used for the system to always express the  genes.
  </P><P>
  In the original operon <I>rhlA</I> and <I>rhlB</I> are expressed together with <I>rhlC</I>, which encodes for rhamnosyltransferase II (Rahim <I>et al</I> 2001) and regulatory genes <I>rhlI</I> and <I>rhlR</I> (Pearson  <I>et al</I>. 1997). Since only mono-rhamnolipids are desired in our construct, <I>rhlC</I> is not incorporated into our construct. Expression of <I>rhlA</I> and <I>rhlB</I> is possible without the regulatory genes and they were as well not included in the final construct.

  </FIGCAPTION><H2>Method</H2><U><P>Assembly</P></U><P>
  3A assembly was used to assemble the parts that were required to build the construct from the iGEM distribution kit. First RBS, (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_B0034</SPAN></A>) was assembled with gene <I>rhlA</I> and <I>rhlB</I> respectively into
 (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688002"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688002</SPAN></A>) and (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688002"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688003</SPAN></A>). This was followed by assembly of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688002"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688002</SPAN></A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_B0034</SPAN></A> and  <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688003"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688003</SPAN></A> into <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688001"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688001</SPAN></A>. An Anderson promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23101"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_J23101</SPAN></A>) was assembled with this part to give the final construct, (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688000"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688000</SPAN></A>). The length of the assembled part was confirmed using gel electrophoresis at each stage and correct assembly was verified using Sanger sequencing.
  </P><P>
  For assembly steps <I>E.coli</I>, strain DH5Î± was used as a chassi since it gives good plasmid preparation results and high transformation frequencies. (Forster <I>et al</I>. 2014) The final construct was transformed into <I>E.coli</I>, strain BL21DE3 since it gives better protein expression.
  </P><P>
  To verify expression of genes <I>rhlA</I> and <I>rhlB</I> the final construct was assembled together with (<A hrf="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1688004"><SPAN class="res_link">BBa_K1688004</SPAN></A>), a dTomato construct consisting of an RBS and a gene encoding for a modified RFP. This gives the bacteria a unique red fluorescent colour when the genes are expressed.
  </P><U><P>Characterization</P></U><P>
  A couple of assays were performed to determine the presence of mono-rhamnolipids. First of all a drop collapse test was conducted for confirmatory reasons. In the presence of biosurfactants, the drop collapses due to the decrease of surface tension of the hydrophobic surface (oil). In the absence, the drop does not collapse and remains intact like a bubble. (Walter <I>et al</I>. 2010)
  </P><P>
  To further determine the presence of mono-rhamnolipids CTAB (cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide) plating was used. This is a widely used method for detecting rhamnolipids. Agar plates containing the CTAB were made using a standardized protocol. The plates contain methylene blue and CTAB. The rhamnolipids forms a complex with the CTAB and forms a halo around the colony. One can thus conclude that if there is a halo, rhamnolipids should be present. (Siegmund and Wagner. 1991)
  </P><P>
  Both the drop collapse test and the CTAB test are nonspecific and only show indication that there are biosurfactants and rhamnolipids respectively present. To confirm the presence of mono-rhamnolipids, a thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted of the sample and with standard mono-rhamnolipids as reference. Mono-rhamnolipids were extracted from bacterial supernatant by solvent-extraction method using ethyl acetate and run on TLC silica plates using orcinol-sulphuric acid as a staining solution (Laabei <I>et al</I>. 2014). The extracted lipids were also sent for mass spectrometry analysis for further confirmation.
