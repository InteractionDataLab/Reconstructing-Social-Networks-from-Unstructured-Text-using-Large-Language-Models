The Kit-y Lacs have been working with the laccases from the iGEM distribution kit, CotA and CueO, as well as the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase. These enzymes are the main degradation machinery in our system.

Cryosleep
Laccalicious have been working with the NahR/Psal promoter system that regulates the expression of our degrading enzymes, as well as reporter genes that indicate that PAH:s are being degraded. They have also tried to incorporate a new, modified laccase into the construct to test its potential.

The Biosurfers have tried to express rhamnolipids, biosurfactants that dissolve the hydrophobic aggregates of PAH:s and allow more interactions with our degrading enzymes.
