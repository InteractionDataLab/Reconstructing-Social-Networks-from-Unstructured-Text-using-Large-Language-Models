Visiting a high school in Uppsala
One of our objectives alongside our main project is to highlight the importance of spreading information about synthetic biology as a subject. We therefore decided to visit a school in Uppsala, with the purpose of informing the students of all the good things that can be done and is enabled with synthetic biology, and how better to do this than talk about iGEM?
We chose to pay a visit to the high school Rosendalsgymnasiet, in order to inform its students about the possibilities that synthetic biology enabled, and also try to obtain their opinions on the subject. This school was chosen due to its strong program in natural science, and the presentation were to be held to the students who is completing their third and last year and are going to take a course in biotechnology over the coming year.
The lecture was focused both on teaching the students about synthetic biology, its applications in general and on informing them of iGEM in particular. The students appeared to be very interested in the subject and followed the presentation closely. Afterwards questions about the applications of synthetic biology were answered, not to mention about our project in particular. We felt very well received by the school and the students, and would say that it appeared to be a rewarding experience for everyone involved!
