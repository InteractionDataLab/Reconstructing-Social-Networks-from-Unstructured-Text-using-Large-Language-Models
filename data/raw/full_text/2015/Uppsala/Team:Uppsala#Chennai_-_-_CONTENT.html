  One of our team members met Team SVCE Chennai during her vacation in India and came to know that they are participating in iGEM for the first time. Since they were from the same institute where she pursued her bachelors, she went right away to meet them during her vacation. Both our teams agreed to collaborate. 
  </P><P>
  As they were completely new to the iGEM, she explained to them how iGEM actually works and provided some tips on how to organise a student project. After she got back, we were in regular contact through skype meetings and frequent email conversations. They helped us by filling the survey forms for our Policies and Practices work and we also gave suggestions on where to focus for the  same with respect to their project which is engineering mini cells to produce bacteriocin that causes gastrointestinal infections . We also helped them on passing their survey form to the doctors in Sweden to get an expert opinion related to their project.
  </P><H2>Collaboration with SDU Denmark</H2><P>
  After the Nordic Jamboree we were discussing a sponsor deal with the antibody producer Agrisera who wanted to find out the amount of antibodies used in iGEM. During SDUâ€™s presentation at the Nordic Jamboree we found out that their project were focused on creating an alternative to antibodies using <I>E. coli</I> and we thought that a collaboration could be beneficial to them as well. SDU did an analysis of how many iGEM teams used and are using antibodies. The collected and compiled data of iGEM teams using antibodies was later on shared between Uppsala and SDU.
