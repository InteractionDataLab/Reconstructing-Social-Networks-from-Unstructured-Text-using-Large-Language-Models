Experiments and protocols
A majority of the protocols we used originate from the book "Synthetic biology-A lab manual", written by Anthony Forster, Erik Gullberg and Josefine Liljeruhm. They can therefore not be published here. We do however recommend you to buy it, as it was a great help in our project. The following protocols from the sixth chapter of this book were used:
0.9% NaCl
50% Glycerol
1M CaCl2
10x TBE Buffer
SOB Medium
LB Medium
LB Agar Plates and Addition of Antibiotics
Overnight Cultures with antibiotics and glycerol stocks
Agarose gel electrophoresis
Preparation of competent E. coli cells using CaCl2
Transformation of CaCl2 competent E. coli cells
Bacterial re-streak techniques
Digestion with DpnI
3A assembly
Colony PCR
We also used several other protocols which we share below.

Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)
Materials needed
IMAC Column; ice, stand, sample tubes.
Sample Buffer (50mM of Sodiumphosphate, 60mM imidazol, 1 M NaCl: pH 7.1)
Elution Buffer (50mM Sodiumphosphate, 300mM imidazol, 1M NaCl: pH7.1)
Pump
Ni(II)sulfate solution (20mM)
Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow gel.
Step 1: Packing of the IMAC column.
Assemble the columns bottom part, tube and adapter. Leave the top adapter. It will be connected last to remove any bubbles.
Degas 200ml sample buffer and roughly 200mL deionized water.
Calibrate the pump flow rate to 1ml/min.
Pipette carefully degassed gel into the column (the column should be filled with 1-2cm of sedimented gel).
Fill the column carefully, without stiring the gel, with deionized water.
Connect the last adapter and make sure there are no bubbles in the column. (Connecting it migth require some force).
Step 2: Equilibrate the column
By equilibrating the column with Ni2+ ions, the HIS-taged proteins will bind to the column.
Run 20mL of NI(II)sulfate solution thorugh the column.
The gel will be saturated with Ni^+2. The waste solution should be gathered in a special tube for separete disposal due to environmental reasons.
Wash the column with roughly 20ml of deionized water. This will remove the excess of Ni+2.
Now equilibrate the column with 30ml of degassed sample buffer.
Step 3.  Running the column with sample.
Degas 70ml of elution buffer.
Run your sample through the column. Gather the flowthrough liquid in a marked collection tube.
Wash the column with 30 ml of degassed sample buffer. Gather the flowthrough in 10ml fractions (Mark your fractions) . This will wash out losely bound proteins.
Now elute your sample by running 20ml degassed elution buffert. Gather the flowthrough in 5ml fractions
Now wash the column with 20 ml of degassed elution buffer and gather 10ml fractions. This is to make sure that all of the sample has been washed out.
Ion exchange cromatography protocol
Buffer
Prepare a phosphate buffer with a pH above or below relative to the proteins Pi.
The buffer should either positive or negativly charge the protein dependent on the charge of the Ion exchange coloumn.
Ion exchange column
Colomn Size: the size of the colomn is chosen based on the binding capacity of the gel matrix.
NaCI Gradient
Prepare a NaCI gradient to wash the columnbound protein with.  Following NaCI gradient can be modified and custom made: Stock solution of NaCl with 1M diluted into 11 different 50ml falcon tubes and with one 0mM. Gradient of NaCl with concentrations:
0 mM
50 mM
100 mM
150 mM
200 mM
250 mM
300 mM
350 mM
400 mM
450 mM
500 mM
1000 mM
Step 1
Before running your cell lysis through the column it needs to be equilibrated by the chosen buffer.
Run at least 2 column volumes 10x the concentration of the buffer.
Run at least 2 column volumes 1x the concentration of the buffer.
Step 2
Running sample through the column
Run the sample through the column
Your protein is now bound to the gel matrix.
Step 3
Wash the column with the NaCI matrix.
Use the same amount of collection tubes as the number of different NaCl-gradients you will use.
Run the first concentration of the NaCI gradient and collect in a marked collection tube.
Continue running the NaCI gradient and collecting in collection tubes.
Your sample is now, hopefully and if done correctly, in one of your collection tubes.

Biosurfactant characterization protocols
Drop collapse test
Materials required: 50mm petri plates, stop watch, olive oil and bacterial culture
Method:
A 50mm petri plate was covered with 600 µl of olive oil.
In the centre of the plate, small drops of either 50 or 100µl of bacterial culture were placed.
The drop was observed for eventual collapse and the diameter of the drop was measured after 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min.
A collapsed drop indicate that the presence of biosurfactants.
Thin Layer Chromatography
Materials required: Bacterial culture, 0.45 syringe filter, ethyl acetate, ethanol, chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, orcinol, sulphuric acid, hot air oven, vacuum centrifuge and TLC silica plates
Sample preparation:
Overnight bacterial culture was centrifuged 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Supernatant of the samples were filtered using 0,45 μm syringe filter.
The filtered supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate in 1:1 v/v ratio three times.
The organic solvent was removed by evaporation using vacuum centrifuge overnight.
10 μl 99% ethanol was added to the dried samples which then could be loaded on TLC silica plates
TLC Analysis:
TLC was performed using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid in a ratio of 65:15:2 as a developing solvent.
For visualisation, the plate that has been developed was air dried and sprayed with a detection agent composed of 0.075 g orcinol, 4.1 mL sulphuric acid (60 %, v/v) and 21 mL deionised H2O.
The plate was left to dry at room temperature, and then, the sugar moieties were stained by incubating the plates at 110 °C for 10 min.
