Our journey to Gold
After a summer with a lot of fun and a lot of laboratory work, 14 out of 24 students went to the Giant Jamboree in Boston, Massachusetts, USA to present the project to the judges and the other teams.
All the iGEM teams gathered in the great auditorium and we were welcomed to the Jamboree by the heads of iGEM HQ. Our project presentation was scheduled for the first day of the Jamboree. We were working rigorously on the presentation up until the moment. The team was both excited and nervous but in the end it was a big success. We had an audience of other teams that filled up the whole room that was there to support us.

The session was distributed over two halls and there were refreshments for everyone. There were two halls for posters where the teams and judges could mingle around and talk to the different teams about their projects and achievements, and several halls for presentations, so that several team could present simultaneously. The Jamboree took place over 4 days where we hade time to go and see some other teams presentations and talk to them about their interesting projects.

Our own video iGEM Funk was shown on the big screen during the award ceremony and it was a success! Psst. if you have missed our youtube videos, click on the youtube button down in the bottom of the page or click on the picture to go directly to the iGEM Funk-video!

The whole iGEM Giant Jamboree was a great experience where we got to showcase our project that we worked hard on over the summer. In the end, our efforts were rewarded with a Gold Medal! Our project was also nominated for Best Project in the Environment track! (meaning that we were in the top four teams out of 33 iGEM teams in that track!)

There were 280 teams present at the Jamboree. It was great fun being able to meet other students from all over the world!
Now that the summer is over and the competition is finished we are happy to say that we all are pleased with the results of our project and very proud of our achievements. We all had a very exciting journey, both in the lab and to Boston where we gained a lot of knowledge about synthetic biology and teamwork!
