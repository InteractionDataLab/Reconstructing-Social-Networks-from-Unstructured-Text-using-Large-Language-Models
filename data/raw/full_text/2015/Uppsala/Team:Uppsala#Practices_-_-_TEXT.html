The policies and practises have always been an important part of the Uppsala iGEM projects and we have worked hard this year to incorporate it as much as possible in our project. We have tried to reach out to the community in various ways. We visited a high school in Uppsala to inform younger students about iGEM, synthetic biology and the great possibilities that exist in this field of study. We also visited a power plant to investigate how the Decyclifier could be incorporated in the industrial process to further reduce the concentration of toxic PAHs. Surveys were made for the public to both inform people about our project and synthetic biology and in return learn their opinions of it.
To further connect with society we have been active on different social media throughout the summer, like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. More than that we had interviews and articles about the project and iGEM published in several newspapers.
This summer we have had collaborations with several other iGEM teams. Together with the Stockholm iGEM team we organized a much appreciated Nordic iGEM conference where we were lucky enough to have Randy Rettberg, the chairman of iGEM organization, visiting and participating in the activities we had planned.  Furthermore we helped the Indian team SVCE Chennai, who are participating in iGEM for the first time, to get started and together with SDU Denmark we collected and compiled data of iGEM teams using antibodies when discussing a sponsor deal with the antibody producer Agrisera.
