Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent carcinogens produced by various activities ranging from grilling meat to coal gasification. Our project aims to degrade high molecular weight PAHs present in industrial waste from district heating plants. There is currently no sustainable way to handle this waste and therefore it is deposited in landfills. We want to solve this problem by  employing a bacterial based system.
Our cells need to be able to detect the PAHs for direct degradation. However the high molecular weight PAHs do not readily pass through the cell membrane. We solved this obstacle by using the low weight PAH, naphthalene, as an indicator for the presence of heavier PAHs. The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes the expression of a series of enzymes for PAH degradation which are secreted outside the cell where they can oxidize and cleave the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds. This in turn makes them available for downstream biodegradation. To increase the degradation efficiency, our system also produces rhamnolipids. These are biosurfactants that prevent the PAHs from aggregating, making them easier for the enzymes to access.

Laccase and dioxygenase are enzymes that are central to our project. Click here to learn more about how we use them!
The degradation of naphthalene is what activates our whole construct. Click here to learn more about how this happens!
We used rhamnolipids to increase our enzymes' accessibility to the PAH:s. Click here to find out more about how we incorporated them into our system!
We needed a fluorometer to measure the efficiency of our system, but we quickly noticed that getting hold of one was not that easy. Therefore, we built our own!
We collaborated with the iGEM team from Stockholm to arrange a meetup of nordic teams in Uppsala. Click here to learn more about the Nordic iGEM Conference!
