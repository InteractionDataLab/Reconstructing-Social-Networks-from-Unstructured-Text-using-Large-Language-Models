BBa_K1688004
Coding
726 bp
Composite part consisting of the RBS, BBa_B0034, and the red fluorescent protein, dTomato (BBa_K1688019). dTomato has not been bricked previously.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688005
Coding
3810 bp
BBa_J61051, nahR with nahR and sal promoters (Pr and Psal), codes for the inducible repressor NahR, which suppresses Psal in the absence of salicylate. This biobrick makes it possible to regulate the expression of the red fluorescent protein, dTomato, and the modified D439A/M510L CueO laccase (ModLac) with attached N-His6 tag and C-export tag (HlyA, BBa_K554002).
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688006
Coding
1800 bp
A modified laccase (D439A/M510L CueO) with N-His6 tag attached to it via a linker sequence and an export tag (HlyA, BBa_K554002) attached to its C-terminus.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688007
Coding
1843 bp
Assembly of Anderson promoter BBa_J23110 and RBS + ModLac with HlyA tag (BBa_K1688006). ModLac is a modified laccase (D439A/M510L CueO) with N-His6 tag attached to it via a linker sequence and an export tag (HlyA, BBa_K554002) attached to its C-terminus.

BBa_K1688008
Coding
1651 bp
An RBS assembled with the dTomato coding sequence, expressing a modified RFP.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688009
Coding
4977 bp
The regulatory NahR construct assembled with the coding sequence for dTomato, as well as the coding sequence for the modified laccase.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688010
Coding
769 bp
Assembly of Anderson promoter BBa_J23101 and RBS + dTomato (BBa_K1688004). dTomato has not been bricked previously.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688011
Coding
769 bp
A constitutive Anderson promoter assembled with the coding sequence for the modified laccase without an export tag.
Laccalicious
BBa_K1688012
Coding
2002 bp
A constitutive Anderson promoter assembled with the coding sequence for the modified laccase without an export tag.
