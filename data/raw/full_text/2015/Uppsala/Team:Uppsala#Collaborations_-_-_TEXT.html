Collaborations
Nordic iGEM Conference
Helping other teams
Collaborations between teams is the very foundation of iGEM, and this year the Uppsala team partook in three major collaborations. Firstly, we arranged and hosted the very first Nordic iGEM conference together with the Stockholm iGEM team. In this project, planning, innovation and physical work was done in total collaboration. Secondly, we assisted the Chennai team in the start-up of their very first iGEM project. Planning an entire iGEM project is hard enough as it is, and to do it without any previous knowledge of the completion is even trickier. As such we provided Chennai with all the help we could give. Lastly we had a survey collaboration with SDU Denmark regarding the use of antibodies in iGEM.
Apart from these major collaborations, we also assisted several teams by answering surveys and providing them with previous years Uppsala biobricks not present in the distribution kit. Among the most popular were the famous Uppsala chromo proteins that were shipped to both Australia and Taiwan.
