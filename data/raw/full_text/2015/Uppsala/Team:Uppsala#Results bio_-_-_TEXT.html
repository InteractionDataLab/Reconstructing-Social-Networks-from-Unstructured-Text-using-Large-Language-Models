Red fluorescent color expression of cells from figure 3 indicates that the mono-rhamnolipid gene construct is working, in effect the genes rhlA and rhlB are transcribed.

Figure 5: A bar graph displaying the expansion of drop of different samples. Data from table 3
Table 2 and figure 4 displays data of drop expansion test with standard mono-rhamnolipids (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1 and 1.6 mg/ml). Table 3 and figure 5 displays the data of drop expansion test of LB medium, supernatant extracted from E.coli BL21DE3 with BBa_K1688000 respectively untransformed and supernatant extracted from E.coli DH5α with BBa_K1688000 respectively untransformed.
Table 2 shows that a higher concentration of mono-rhamnolipids causes the drop to expand more and collapse faster. This verifies that presence of rhamnolipids can be indicated from drop collapse tests. The drop from sample BBa_K1688000 in BL21DE3 from table 3 collapsed after 30 seconds and expansion of drop diameter was 120% within 5 minutes from 1 cm to 2.2 cm which indicate presence of biosurfactant. The drop from sample BBa_K1688000 in DH5α collapsed and diameter expansion of drop was 90% after 20 minutes. This indicates some presence of biosurfactants. As expected the test indicate that BBa_K1688000 has higher expression rates and rhamnolipid production was higher in BL21DE3 than in DH5α as BL21DE3 is good for protein expression. The negative controls, LB medium and untransformed BL21DE3 and DH5α showed very little expansion or no expansion, which is expected as they do not produce biosurfactants.

Clear spots were detected in lane 2, 4, 5 and 6 in figure 7 corresponding to the sample extracted from BL21DE3 cells with biobrick BBa_K1688000 and standard mono-rhamnolipid 10, 30 respectively 50 μg. The detection spot of BBa_K1688000 had a retention factor 0,82, the same or similar retention factor as the detection spots for standard mono-rhamnolipids (table 4), which confirms mono-rhamnolipid synthesis by BBa_K1688000 in BL21DE3 cells.
Negative control; BL21DE3 untransformed in lane 1 (figure 7) showed no spot which is expected as BL21DE3 do not produce biosurfactants naturally. P. putida as a positive control showed no spot. This might be because of too low concentration of rhamnolipids in sample, problems with extraction of rhamnolipids or sample contamination. Low concentration of rhamnolipids in supernatant might be because of used medium and growth conditions.

Conclusion
The drop collapse test, CTAB test, TLC and mass spectrometry showed positive result and we could confirm that mono-rhamnolipids are expressed by our construct ( BBa_K1688000 ) with E.coli BL21DE3. However, we still need to study their expression in the presence of PAH degrading enzymes (dioxygenase and laccase) and PAHs, to know whether these may influence the mono-rhamnolipid synthesis. Our future plan is that biosurfactant strains will be used together with the strains that expresses the PAH degrading enzymes. The biosurfactants will make the clustered PAHs more available to the degrading enzymes which will result in a more efficient degradation.
