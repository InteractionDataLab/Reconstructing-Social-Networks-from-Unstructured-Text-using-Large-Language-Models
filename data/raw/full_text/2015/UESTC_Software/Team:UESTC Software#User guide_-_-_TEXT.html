Main window
This is main window of MCCAP, and only two buttons on it.  Click on the “start” button to start using it. If you are using for the first time, you can click on the “help” button beside.
Choosing reference species
Click on “start” and then we come into a window which is used to choose reference species. You can choose species by pulling them to right side or double clicking them.
Main buttons
There are six buttons on the bottom. From left to right are sort, home, save,  history, reset and next.
What we need to explain are “save” and “history”.
You can save the current reference species by save button.
And then check them by history.
These two buttons are used for comparison of two minimal gene set.
Viewing minimal gene set
Let us click on next. What appears in front of us is the result of minimal gene set and corresponding gene network.
Click one of categories to view the minimal gene set.
Click one of gene cluster to see detailed information. Left side is list of genes, and right side is base information of gene cluster and corresponding biobricks.
Click “view all” to see all biobricks which corresponding genes are included in our database.
Download minimal gene set
Click download button to download the result of minimal gene set.
Comparing two minimal gene set
Save at least two sets of reference species, then you can check them by clicking “history” button. Select two of them, and click on the arrows to view the result.
Viewing gene network diagram
You can click on the “pathway” or “module” to view corresponding gene network diagram.
Then there is a list of gene network diagram.
Each gene in minimal gene set has been marked with red color.
