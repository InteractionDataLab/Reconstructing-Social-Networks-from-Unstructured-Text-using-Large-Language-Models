Find father
Find father is a mini game which is coded by UESTC—software of iGEM. Actually, it is a game for simulating minimal genome selection and linking with PC—side software. It is developed completely by xcode. And it tells players the basic process through an ancient Chinese story that the dragon breeds nine sons. Authentically the story is rearranged by us.
Recur roles of the ancient story
With careful preparation of our art designers, we use five roles as far as possible. However, there are nine roles in ancient story. It can reduce the difficulty of the game to some extent. It lets players enjoy fun and the feelings of freshness of ancient story.
Each image is
painted manually by our design team.
The background, interface, buttons and vivid characters in the game are painted manually by our art designers. We studied the description of the five roles in ancient story. Then art designers showed five vivid characters as far as possible.
Fully understand
the essence of the game
The core of the game, which is applied skillfully in the entire game. In the process of experiencing game, players can understand basic ideas of finding minimal gene easily. It can not only help understand knowledge of synthetic biology, but also can help understand PC—side software.
Dramatic Game mode
The mode of entire game is based on the core of the game. The key concept is that the gene is regarded as the minimal gene, if it appears  more than half of the individual. The game is the same. A gene is regarded as the gene when we find a gene that appears more than half of the sons of dragon. After we have found all essential genes, their father—dragon will be called.
