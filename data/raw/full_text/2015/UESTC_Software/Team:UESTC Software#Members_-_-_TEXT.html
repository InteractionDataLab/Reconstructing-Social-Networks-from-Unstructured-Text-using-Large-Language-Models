Duan Yaocong
Major: Biotechnology
Hi everyone! This is my third year in Biotechnology. I’m the team leader and responsible for the contact with instructors and advisors, team management and software development as well. In IGEM I can find an opportunity to develop our ideas and to be a part of science. Through the processes we are doing a lot of things and now I have a greater vision of synthetic biology. I love our team, just like home, we are all working and giving our best for our project.
Zou Wenbo
Major: Biomedical Engineering
Leader of team and IOS programmer. I’m very glad to be a member of our software team and enjoy the atmosphere of our team for chasing the same goal together. In the last few months, I have gained much more synthetic biology knowledge and programming skill. So far, joining IGEM is the most exciting thing in my college life. I truly look forward to sharing our project with IGEMers around the world. Also hope to gain a better grade for our team.
Mai Huahe
Major: Information and Software Engineering
Hello everybody! My name is Mai Huahe. It is my pleasure to participate in this competition with several companions. Among our team, I focus on the wiki’s designing   and making, together with another partner. Although at first we are we were so confused about the aspect of design, after a fierce discussion with teachers and teammates, we confirmed a perfect designing plan at last. I feel so happy to work with these lovely partners and enjoy this wonderful experience.
Wen Yuji
Major: Information and Software Engineering
Hello, dear IGEMers! It’s Wen Yuji here, a senior student in Information and Software Engineering Department of UESTC. It is an unforgettable experience working with students in Biology Department. I take part in the wiki designing with Mai Huahe. Beyond that, I’m a web editor. I’m extremely happy to take place in the UESTC-software IGEM team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement.
Xia Song
Major: Biomedical Engineering
It is my third year in Biomedical Engineering. I’m the main designer of the poster and other parts that need art design. Participating in IGEM team is a good opportunity for me to improve my skill of design, and also enhance my interests of the subject called biology. What’s more, I realize that I should keep an open mind to graduate school or a career in different areas of science and biology.
Yang Xue
Major: Biomedical Engineering
Hello folks! It’s Yang Xue here. This is my first year at IGEM. For me, IGEM means being with friends and having fun by doing things and stepping forward together. Of course fun is not what IGEM all about, it also requires lots of research and work. I play an important role in promoting the process of project and do much work on the arrangement for wiki. I think IGEM is a perfect way to improve my knowledge and enjoy being a part of science, IGEM.
