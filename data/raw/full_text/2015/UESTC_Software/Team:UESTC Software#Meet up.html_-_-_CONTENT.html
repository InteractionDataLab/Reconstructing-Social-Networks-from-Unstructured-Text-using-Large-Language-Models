So on July 25, 2015, we invited Sichuan University , Sichuan Agricultural University, Southwest University of Nationalities，Chengdu Shude High School and Bio maker to participate in the party which is organized by us(UESTC).
					</P><P>  Firstly, the advisor Huang Jian introduced the history and background, some requires of iGEM and some matters of needing attention according to his experience in the communication meeting. Then, each school had its own report. Sichuan University iGEM experimental team had introduced their own nitrogen and carbon sequestration technologies in microorganism. Another experimental team of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China shared their novel magnetotactic bacterium. We also shared our stories, introducing the software development of minimum set of genes prediction technology in the perspective of bioinformatics, including the MCCAP and FIND FATHER. With the deepening of communication, we spread a wide mind exchanging. It made everybody a clearer understanding of the iGEM project and promoted more interest. This is a good start for the collaboration of iGEM teams in southwest of China. In the end, the instructor Guo Fengbiao made a summary and encouraged us to do what we like. After the end of the seminar, we wrote press releases and published in school website of UESTC, making more people know more information about iGEM.
					</P><P>  We felt surprised and cheerful to discuss tasks with other teams. Thanking for each school coming for this party. And we can`t wait to go to Boston for Giant Jamboree!

Both of us introduced our software to the high school students, which was very interesting. We introduced our own iGEM tasks and shared a lot of experience. Besides, we talk about iGEM more after the meeting.

The data of genome sequencing is very sophisticated and enormous. But their study was charming and provided some advice with our tasks as well.
