This is my third year in Biotechnology. I’m the team leader and responsible for the contact with instructors and advisors, team management and software development as well. In IGEM I can find an opportunity to develop our ideas and to be a part of science. Through the processes we are doing a lot of things and now I have a greater vision of synthetic biology. I love our team, just like home, we are all working and giving our best for our project. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="mem_Per_des"><DIV class="tablecell_box"><H2>Zou Wenbo</H2><P>Major: Biomedical Engineering</P><P>Leader of team and IOS programmer. I’m very glad to be a member of our software team and enjoy the atmosphere of our team for chasing the same goal together. In the last few months, I have gained much more synthetic biology knowledge and programming skill. So far, joining IGEM is the most exciting thing in my college life. I truly look forward to sharing our project with IGEMers around the world. Also hope to gain a better grade for our team.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="members_li clearfix swiper-slide"><DIV class="wen_half_content ani" swiper-animate-effect="fadeIn" swiper-animate-duration="0.3s" swiper-animate-delay="0.1s"><DIV class="mem_Per_des"><DIV class="tablecell_box"><H2>Mai Huahe</H2><P>Major: Information and Software Engineering
								Hello everybody! My name is Mai Huahe. It is my pleasure to participate in this competition with several companions. Among our team, I focus on the wiki’s designing   and making, together with another partner. Although at first we are we were so confused about the aspect of design, after a fierce discussion with teachers and teammates, we confirmed a perfect designing plan at last. I feel so happy to work with these lovely partners and enjoy this wonderful experience.
