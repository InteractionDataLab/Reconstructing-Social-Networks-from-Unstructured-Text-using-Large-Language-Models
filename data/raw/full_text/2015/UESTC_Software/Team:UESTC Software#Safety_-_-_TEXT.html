Does your software open source? Could it be used by others?
Yes, our software is GPL. And everyone can use it but it is mainly to assist researchers.
How do you verify the results that your software run? Are they right?
To a certain extent , we compare the results that our software run with the data from paper called CEG: a database of essential gene clusters. On the other hand, we do the validation about our results through modeling.

What function does your software has?
My software has many advantages. MCCAP will inspire our interests by seeking our common ancestor, making the chassis of artificial cell, producing antimicrobial drug targets and promoting the synthesis of bacterial strain which is more adapted to the needs as well.
If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?
The researchers who study and specialize in genome will benefit most if our product is successful. It will lay groundwork for creating artificial life as well. However, the software may replace some people`s work, which would lower their salary.
Where will your product be used? Can it cause pollution?
It is mainly used in laboratory. It can`t cause any pollutions.
Who will use your product?
Not only people who research in minimal gene set and essential genes will make use of our software, but also apps developers. We provide complete API which are able to invoke most of our software functions smoothly in their own software.
What are your organization's security guidelines? Please give a link.

Does it have some risks in health of people?
No, it doesn`t.
Does it have some risks of environment (From the wasting water or others )?
No. Our software doesn`t contain these dangers and pollutions.
Please describe the risks of your software.
It predicted the minimum set of genes is not absolutely correct. It has a measure of error.
