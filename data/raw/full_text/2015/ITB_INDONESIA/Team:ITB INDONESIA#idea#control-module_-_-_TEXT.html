Control Module
Lac promoter is known to be a leaky promoter. It means that there will be a transcription even though lactose is absent. To increase the control-ability of our construct, we add LacI module. We differentiate the strength of additional LacI production (none, weak, medium, or strong) using constitutive promoters with different strength.

We are able to assembly the medium and strong control, but unfortunately we were unsuccessful to transform the weak promoter part from BioBrick 2015 distribution, therefore we couldn't assembly the weak device.
