Ika Agus Rini
Biotechnology, Graduate
Team Leader
She is the leader of ITB_Indonesia team or you could call her the “General Assistant”. Ika has to arrange the team for what they need to do based on the final decision of the team meeting. She does the work of wetlab and other divisions. See?? She looks like a general assistant but she’d love it very much.
Her hobby is reading, but reading journal isn't her hobby. Besides that, She really likes watching movie and cycling, because they make her relax and also kills the stress after lab work.
She joined this team because she just wants to enrich her experience because she is experience seeker...
After joining the team, hwooooooo so many things to think, so many things to do but she'd love it very much because it makes her upgrade herself about a lot of things.

Public Relation
He is the Head of Wetlab Division of ITB_Indonesia, holds the responsibility to conduct the experiments. Despite his tight schedules, he loves reading, swimming, listening to classical musics, and series-binge watching.
His motivation to participate in this team is to develop the synthetic biology in Indonesia.
He thinks that the ITB_Indonesia 2015 is an AWESOME team.
“Yes, wetlab is exhausting but the whole experience of working interdisciplinary with awesome people is so engaging and mind-opening.”
She is the secretary of our team and also a member of the wetlab division.
Her main responsibility as secretary is to manage administration tasks in the team such as proposal activity for internal and external fundraising, and a lot of letters for iGEM ITB_Indonesia activity permission. At the wetlab division, she does some couple tasks and make sure the facilities and equipments are available for the wetlab work. She also loves to help fundraising project whether she keeps the money or accounting the money that flow in and out in our lab.
Her hobbies are traveling and snorkeling around Indonesia, even now she rarely does it because she still conducts her research in master degree. Her other hobbies is drawing, make a doodle and some random amateur design, she puts a couple of her artwork in her social media network such as Inst**ram and T*m*lr.
Indah is very interested in synthetic biology and she hopes by joining ITB_Indonesia team will enrich her experience in manage big interdisciplinary research project. Besides that, she wants to improve her team management skill and team working skills together with ITB_Indonesia member.
After several months in the team, she feel like sit in ferris wheel because sometimes it up, sometimes it down, feel like sweet and bitter simultaneously. In her opinion iGEM is the real competition not only comparing our work with other team, but also how we can manage and improve ourselves together to be more competent to reach our project goal. It is all about teamwork, hard working, responsibility and of course, big heart. She really love her team mate :).
Haryanto is working together with the human practice team to hold education and public engagement related events in order to promote synthetic biology in Indonesia and to educate the society.
At his free time, he loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games.
He was eager to join this team because he'd like to participate in a international level competition and also to enhance his leadership experience besides expanding his connections.
Based from his experience, he could gain a lot of experiences after joining this team, by overcoming all the challenges and issues regarding the iGEM competition. My fellow iGEM team members inspire me a lot in their own way and this made him happy.
As a fund raising coordinator, first, she evaluates iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2014 sponsorship tracks. Collect company contacts that have a prospect for our sponsorship proposal through colleagues and company’s website. Once the proposal is done, it is reviewed by the team members. Then she selects team members who will be responsible to send the proposal to some of the listed company. Proposal is sent by mail or email. The company is contacted for proposals confirmation by phone or email after 2-4 weeks. Another fund raising role is done by selling beverages, flowers, lunch, iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt, and etc.
Not only actively involved in the fund raising activities, as a wetlab team member, she is responsible for laboratory preparation such as accommodate laboratory supply, provide competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression. Then assembling reporter module and also have it transformed to E. coli cells.
Her hobbies are playing with cats and playing music.
Since contributing in synthetic biology is completely new for her, so she hopes that this practice will be more comprehensive rather than lecture in class. This practice provides her an ability to be creative and innovative inside or outside the laboratory. This competition also supports her to build a teamwork with a different disciplines and improve our leadership and managerial skill, how to act with integrity, courage, dedication and full of responsibility. So, iGEM is not only a place to get involved in synthetic biology but also a race in world class competition. I hope that in 2015 ITB could maintain the gold titles.
iGEM provides her a really brand new experience working with synthetic biology and also with the team, where we came up with unpredictable results. First, the modelling division confirmed that out first designated module will not work as expected. Then our wetlab division has to turn back re-designing a new module that fully approved by the modelling division. Second, Indonesia 2015 first quarters unstable economic condition consequence many of our proposal got rejected. While we have to deal with the weakness of IDR (Indonesia Rupiah) exchange value to USD (US Dollar). This situation urges our team to raise the money harder, for example by designing and selling an iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt to our colleagues. But this moment also makes our team solid. Third, Seminar and Meet Up iGEM 2015 All Indonesia Team, which was initiated and held by our human practice division is overall awesome. This was the very first moment where all iGEM Indonesia team could be gathered. At this meetup we also shared our iGEM project to the participants whose have different background such as computational, chemistry, mathematics, and etc. Lastly, iGEM competition is completely unforgettable experience for her. Viva iGEM!
He is the one responsible for our public relations matters, striving to connect ITB_Indonesia team with the other iGEM teams and the society.
At his free time, he loves badminton and swimming.
He hopes to help to create a bigger achievement for ITB_Indonesia team.
He thinks our team is great, because we have high spirit to win this competition.

She is one of the design and also wetlab division of ITB_Indonesia. She is one of the team member who designed our team costume.
She wants to learn many things by joining this team.
She thought that this team has a good team work and there are so many thing to do.
She is the coordinator of design division at iGEM ITB team. Paramita, usually called Mita, plans every art and design related work in iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2015 team and coordinates the designing projects with team members, including team Wiki, team hoodie and t-shirt, team logo, posters, presentation, etc.
She loves drawing to fill her free time.
She was eager to join th iGEM ITB this year because she wants to get new friends, new knowledge, new experience. In addition, she’d like to share anything she has with the others, and also to introduce what Synbio is to the world.
She said that, “Being in iGEM ITB team is not easy at all! Need extra energy hahaha!”
Rifqi plays important role in our team. He gives his time and energy at three divisions, that are human practice staff, sponsorship, and design.
Cycling is his hobby.
He joins iGEM ITB 2015 because he wants to improve his social skill in human practice division. Besides that, he is also interested in life science experiment and wants to share this excitement to all the world~
He feels that he has sharpened his ability, especially public speaking because of our work in some places to sell something. He also enhances this skill because he is highly involved in the one of the human practice projects, Car Free Day (CFD) Survey.
She is actively involved in both wetlab and human practice division. At wetlab division: her work is in bioinformatics, she examines the sequencing result, align 16S sequence and make a phylogenetics tree for confirmation. She also studies the rhlAB genes in many bacteria (Pseudomonas, Bulkhorderia, and Bacillus) from database to understand the differences. On the other hand, at human practice: her worked is to promote Indonesian iGEM Team in Bandung Indonesia especially ITB_Indonesia Team and made a Meet Up event to gather all Indonesian iGEM Team.
Her hobby is drinking coffee, listening to music, and hanging with friends.
She likes studying biology. Her field is molecular ecology and conservation. She learned that she could apply synthetic biology to cope with ecological problem so she want to learn about synthetic biology and gain some experience to participate in international competition.
She thought that, “Synthetic biology is very diverse and it consist of many fields. We need to work together to solve a problem. I gain many information and I learn new fields. It was some experience for me.”
You could call her “Ida”. “A double agent” is undoubtedly needed in iGEM team. Just like the other members, she also works for human practice activities besides wetlab division. Sharing our project to people is one of her favorites.
For her wetlab activities, working with primer and synthetic gene is her main focus. She designs the primers and analyzes our synthetic genes. She also works with PCR and gel electrophoresis as her daily routine in our laboratory.
“Just give her tons of novels and she will nail it. Indeed, she loves to read books especially novels.
To learn, not to ask.
To think, not to judge.
To contemplate, not to disregard.
Those are her motivations.
She said that, "Happiness is when you are lovable in a lovely team, and now I am happy because I have my team."

She is a member of the wetlab team. Her main job is doing experiments resulting with the standard curve and growth curve of bacteria used in our project. She thought that in the experiments we must measure amount of bacteria/mL, concentration of specific substrat (D-glucose and lactose), concentration of rhamnolipid produced by bacteria etc... Unique challenges in this job are risk of contamination, inoculate bacteria with spread technique which need full of patience otherwise the medium will rupture and can't be used, and also we must work near fire and alcohol.
Her hobbies are handycrafting, writing, cooking
She wants to learn more about molecular laboratory activity, especially how to engineered gene of bacteria and also to learn teamwork, hear others opinions and learn to discuss to solve problems.
Many lesson she got joining to  the iGEM ITB 2015. She learns how to work in team. She got many friends from other study programs. She hopes the crowdedness of laboratory schedule will improve her skills with the laboratory situations and challenges in there..
He does wetlab kind of stuff that is related to microbiology field with less influence from genetic based method.
Rio loves doing multiple kind of sports and playing with cats.
Joining the team is one of the way for him to try to push himself to the utmost limit of his ability to allow proliferation of his ability in this field.
His testimony after involving in the team  is that “Pretty tire some and actually not much can be helped considering most of the problem were financial or lack of equipment.”
Kinanti helps a lot at the human practice and wet lab division.
At her sparetime, she likes to read, write, doodle, learn to cook, swim and listening to music. Tough, most of the time she spends her time to observing and listening to the surroundings.
Her ultimate motivation is to learn and to contribute in the development of Synthetic Biology in her college and her country.
For the iGEM ITB 2015 team, she thinks that it's really exciting because she really has to learn a lot, and learned a lot during participating in the team. The team members are diverse and yet very open to share their minds.
Satria is the member of the wetlab division.
He provides competent E. coli cells for cloning and expression, assembling reporter module, provide standard and growth curve of E. coli BL21
This guy love to sleep in his free time.
He’d just want to contribute in his own way by joining this team.
There are so much things that he had discovered about synthetic biology, and he realizes how small the world we lived in, based from his experience at ITB_Indonesia.
Udin is the member of modelling division at our team.
He loves reading novel, playing violin, playing computer game, and also solving riddles.
He’d like to apply mathematics in everyday life and to promote mathematics in Indonesia by joining the team.

This guy is the wiki guy.
He's among the few who understands code in the team.
He wonders why he didn't go on to study computer science.
The iGEM 2015 team gave him an opportunity to practice coding and have fun while doing it.
Lusi is our team treasurer and wetlab member. She helps us in collecting money fee from each member every week, updating financial report, and arrange fundraising event such as selling drinks at graduation ceremony.
She loves reading, listening to music, running, and swimming.
She is aiming to join an international competition this year and she has been familiar with iGem since last year. That's why she join the iGEM team this year so she could fulfill her resolution. She is very happy yet busy in this summer. It's an exciting experience to join the iGEM team of ITB for her.
Help wetlab team to make competent cell, make standart curve bacteria, etc and help human practice project such as sosialization about our project to civilization.  walking, watching TV, cycling.
this is a fancy and fantastic competion so maybe she will dissapoint if she doesn't join this project. another reason is want to learn about everything about how to work as a team work, how to work in molecular biology.
After join she think that she get syndrome called "Horizontal gene Transfer" hehe....but it's no problem because in this team she can find a new friend and a new big family..  there are many experience, in here she learn about failed, about trial and error, and about victory yeye...
Ivan loves to play.
Involving in the modelling division of iGEM ITB team is a way for him to get new experience about bacteria modelling.
He thought that there was so much fun at the team.
