Seminar and Workshop at Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung
Once again, on June, 16th, we had the chance to promote synthetic biology and iGEM competition to the students at UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung. ITB_Indonesia public relation had contacted the university since 2 months ago. We were very excited, finally, we were able to conduct this event after so much preparation. The seminar was entitled, “Biodiversity as Basic Knowledge for Synthetic Biology”. This time, we did not only hold an usual seminar where the speakers shared about synthetic biology and iGEM, but also we had a bioinformatic workshop as an innovative human practice activity. As we had investigated before, most of the students or respondents whom participated in our survey/questionnaires were interested in synthetic biology. So, we realized and though of a way to help the students to gain more insights about synthetic biology. There was a saying, “Practice makes perfect!”. Therefore, we designed this workshop in order to help the students understand about primer design, allignment, and how to create a phylogenetic tree. The students from the campus learnt from us enthusiastically since this was the first time for them to learn more about synthetic biology and bioinformatic for the first time!
After the event ended, we had more time to discuss with the Head of Biology Department of the campus, Dr. Tri Cahyadi. He greeted us warmly and were looking forward to collaborating with ITB in the future. Since one of the university visions is to go international, participating in an international competition such as iGEM would be really awesome. He planned to delegate some of his students to ITB to learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM. The following video showed his support for us:
“Hello, let me introduce myself, I am Tri Cahyadi, the Head of Biology Department, Faculty of Science and Technology, UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung. Good luck for ITB_Indonesia team in iGEM competition, in Boston. I hope the team will be success, and be the best as one of the representatives from Indonesia. Since we are from the same city, Bandung, Bandung Juara! For ITB, from UIN Bandung, good luck! Do your best and get the gold medal!” Dr. Tri Cahyadi
