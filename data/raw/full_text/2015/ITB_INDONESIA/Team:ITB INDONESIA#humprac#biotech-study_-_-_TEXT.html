Biotechnology in Indonesia
Biotechnology is one of the developing field in many research institutions in Indonesia. The human practice team of ITB conducted a brief study about the topics of research of biotechnology-related field in many institutions in Indonesia. The result of the study could be used as references by high school students to choose their  school for higher education. In addition, the study also could provide brief information related to the biotechnology-related research in Indonesia, thus the iGEM teams from Indonesia and even the world could find the opportunity for collaboration in the future. We sincerely hope that this study would be helpful for everyone.
