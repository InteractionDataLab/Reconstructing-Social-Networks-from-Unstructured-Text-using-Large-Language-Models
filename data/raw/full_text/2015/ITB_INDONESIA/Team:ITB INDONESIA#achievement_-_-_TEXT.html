Bronze
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete the Judging form.
Create a Team Wiki.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part1 or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
1 BioBrick Part : BBa_K1685001
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part2 or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. This working part must be different to the part documented in bronze medal criteria #6.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Your part must be different to the submission for Bronze medal criteria #6 (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception or other activities (See the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams exemplary work).

Gold
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative human practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the human practices hub for information and examples of previous teams comprehensive and innovative activities).
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Improve the function OR characterization of an previously existing BioBrick Part3 or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year of the iGEM competition) and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your 2015 part range.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
