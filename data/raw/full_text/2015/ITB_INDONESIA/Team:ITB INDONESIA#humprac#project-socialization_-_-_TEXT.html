Project Socialization at Car Free Day (CFD) Bandung
Bandung, the capital city of West Java, has various interesting and attractive events. One of those is the Car Free Day at the famous district of Bandung, Dago. At this every Sunday event, the iGEM team of ITB had a talk with the people of Bandung and tourists from other cities. We also asked for the participation and support from the society for our team by answering our questionnaires regarding to synthetic biology and its applications. There were already three times conducted projects, April, 19th 2015; May, 31st 2015; June, 14th 2015.
