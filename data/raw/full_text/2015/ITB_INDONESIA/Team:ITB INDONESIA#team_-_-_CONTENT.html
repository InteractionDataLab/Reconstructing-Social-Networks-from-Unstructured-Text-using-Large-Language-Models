Despite his tight schedules, he loves reading, swimming, listening to classical musics, and series-binge watching.</P><P>His motivation to participate in this team is to develop the synthetic biology in Indonesia.</P><P>He thinks that the ITB_Indonesia 2015 is an AWESOME team.</P><P>“Yes, wetlab is exhausting but the whole experience of working interdisciplinary with awesome people is so engaging and mind-opening.”</P></DIV><DIV class="biodata indah"><P>She is the secretary of our team and also a member of the wetlab division.</P><P>Her main responsibility as secretary is to manage administration tasks in the team such as proposal activity for internal and external fundraising, and a lot of letters for iGEM ITB_Indonesia activity permission. At the wetlab division, she does some couple tasks and make sure the facilities and equipments are available for the wetlab work. She also loves to help fundraising project whether she keeps the money or accounting the money that flow in and out in our lab.</P><P>Her hobbies are traveling and snorkeling around Indonesia, even now she rarely does it because she still conducts her research in master degree. Her other hobbies is drawing, make a doodle and some random amateur design, she puts a couple of her artwork in her social media network such as Inst**ram and T*m*lr.</P><P>Indah is very interested in synthetic biology and she hopes by joining ITB_Indonesia team will enrich her experience in manage big interdisciplinary research project. Besides that, she wants to improve her team management skill and team working skills together with ITB_Indonesia member.</P><P>After several months in the team, she feel like sit in ferris wheel because sometimes it up, sometimes it down, feel like sweet and bitter simultaneously. In her opinion iGEM is the real competition not only comparing our work with other team, but also how we can manage and improve ourselves together to be more competent to reach our project goal. It is all about teamwork, hard working, responsibility and of course, big heart. She really love her team mate :).</P></DIV><DIV class="biodata haryanto"><P>Haryanto is working together with the human practice team to hold education and public engagement related events in order to promote synthetic biology in Indonesia and to educate the society.</P><P>At his free time, he loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games.</P><P>He was eager to join this team because he'd like to participate in a international level competition and also to enhance his leadership experience besides expanding his connections.</P><P>Based from his experience, he could gain a lot of experiences after joining this team, by overcoming all the challenges and issues regarding the iGEM competition. My fellow iGEM team members inspire me a lot in their own way and this made him happy.</P></DIV><DIV class="biodata annisa"><P>As a fund raising coordinator, first, she evaluates iGEM ITB_Indonesia 2014 sponsorship tracks. Collect company contacts that have a prospect for our sponsorship proposal through colleagues and company’s website. Once the proposal is done, it is reviewed by the team members. Then she selects team members who will be responsible to send the proposal to some of the listed company. Proposal is sent by mail or email. The company is contacted for proposals confirmation by phone or email after 2-4 weeks. Another fund raising role is done by selling beverages, flowers, lunch, iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt, and etc.</P><P>Not only actively involved in the fund raising activities, as a wetlab team member, she is responsible for laboratory preparation such as accommodate laboratory supply, provide competent <I>E. coli</I> cells for cloning and expression. Then assembling reporter module and also have it transformed to <I>E. coli cells</I>.</P><P>Her hobbies are playing with cats and playing music.</P><P>Since contributing in synthetic biology is completely new for her, so she hopes that this practice will be more comprehensive rather than lecture in class. This practice provides her an ability to be creative and innovative inside or outside the laboratory. This competition also supports her to build a teamwork with a different disciplines and improve our leadership and managerial skill, how to act with integrity, courage, dedication and full of responsibility. So, iGEM is not only a place to get involved in synthetic biology but also a race in world class competition. I hope that in 2015 ITB could maintain the gold titles.</P><P>iGEM provides her a really brand new experience working with synthetic biology and also with the team, where we came up with unpredictable results. First, the modelling division confirmed that out first designated module will not work as expected. Then our wetlab division has to turn back re-designing a new module that fully approved by the modelling division. Second, Indonesia 2015 first quarters unstable economic condition consequence many of our proposal got rejected. While we have to deal with the weakness of IDR (Indonesia Rupiah) exchange value to USD (US Dollar). This situation urges our team to raise the money harder, for example by designing and selling an iGEM_Indonesia T-shirt to our colleagues. But this moment also makes our team solid. Third, Seminar and Meet Up iGEM 2015 All Indonesia Team, which was initiated and held by our human practice division is overall awesome. This was the very first moment where all iGEM Indonesia team could be gathered. At this meetup we also shared our iGEM project to the participants whose have different background such as computational, chemistry, mathematics, and etc. Lastly, iGEM competition is completely unforgettable experience for her.
