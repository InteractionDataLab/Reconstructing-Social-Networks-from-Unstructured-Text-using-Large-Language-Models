Seminar and Meetup of Indonesia iGEM Teams
The ITB_Indonesia is proud to be able to host the first meetup of all of iGEM Teams of Indonesia this year at June, 27th 2015. By this great opportunity, we also collaborated with UB_Indonesia and UI_Indonesia to held a seminar. During this seminar, we also had the chance to share each of team’s project this year. In addition, we also asked the participants to flll the Oxford Team’s questionnaires as the form of our human practice collaboration. Not only that, we were also very happy to welcome the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes, through the live chat via skype video call. At the end of the seminar, while having the dinner, we had a discussion regarding the opportunity for collaboration in the next future.Through this seminar, the audiences learnt the sciences behind synthetic biology shared by our first speaker. There were also a lot of questions from the audiences. We believe that through this activity, one of our goals for education and public engagement, which is to spark curiosity was achieved.
Shanghai Meetup
On June, 8th, the public relation of ITB_Indonesia had an opportunity to meet with three teams of China iGEM teams: NYU, STJU, and Tongji in Shanghai, China. A discussion was held to share our project and to learn from each other. On this short visit, our PR learnt and gained insights about the great idea of those three teams ideas and shared them to us in Indonesia.
