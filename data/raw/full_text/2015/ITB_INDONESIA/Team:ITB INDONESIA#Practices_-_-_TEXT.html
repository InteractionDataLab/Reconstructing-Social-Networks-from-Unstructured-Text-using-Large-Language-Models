This year, ITB_Indonesia explores the area related to public engagement and education for the policy and practices. We realized that in order to have a comprehensive point of view over a problem, we also need to cover the perspective from the members of the public. Advices and opinions from the experts should be taken into consideration while doing the project. Thus, the integrated work between the wetlab, drylab, and the policy and practices could be achieved. To share our project and educate the society is also one of the fundamental part of the scientist.The following video would summarize some of the activities that we had done, such as seminar, socialization, and interview with the experts.
