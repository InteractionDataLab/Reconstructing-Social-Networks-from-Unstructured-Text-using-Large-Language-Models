The human practice team of ITB_Indonesia held a seminar with the topic about Synthetic Biology at the library of Institut Teknologi Bandung at May, 2nd 2015. The seminar was attended by many students within the ITB enthusiastically. At this seminar, we provided general knowledge regarding synthetic biology and presented the project of iGEM ITB 2015 this year about Rhamcolipid.
