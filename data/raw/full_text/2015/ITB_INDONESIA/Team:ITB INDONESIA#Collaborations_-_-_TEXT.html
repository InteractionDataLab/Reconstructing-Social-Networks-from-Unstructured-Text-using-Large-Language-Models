Collaborations
As a community, cooperation and collaboration are inevitable in order to achieve better results. ITB_Indonesia took this chance to broaden our network and scope of works by collaborating with the following universities and institution.
Oxford
On the June, 13th, our team contacted Henry, member of the Oxford iGEM team. We had a brief  discussion and shared our project each other through skype video call. As the result, we agreed to exchange questionnaire as a form of human practice collaboration. The Oxford team questionnaires were distributed by ITB_Indonesia team at the Seminar and Meetup event on June, 27th. This was a great opportunity to distribute the questionnaire since the audiences came from many universities and backgrounds. The results of the questionnaire were summarized and sent to the Oxford team. On the other occassion, the Oxford team also distributed ITB team questionnaire and gave us the results. Oxford .
Universitas Indonesia and Universitas Brawijaya
On June, 27th, ITB_Indonesia hosted the first meetup where all of the Indonesia iGEM teams gathered together. We collaborated with UI_Indonesia and UB_Indonesia to conduct a seminar about synthetic biology and shared each of our team project to the public. Through this seminar, we promoted synthetic biology and iGEM to the audiences. We were very happy because we had a chance to have a skype video call with one of the iGEM HQ representative, Ana Sifuentes.
UB_Indonesia
We provided UB_Indonesia 2015 team with E. coli DH5a competent cells. We also helped them by cloning their G-Blocks to pJET, and transformed it to E. coli DH5a. We also transform promoter T7 (BBa_K525998) from iGEM 2015 disribution parts  to E. coli DH5a. Then, we assemble the promoter part with their G-Block into pSB1K3. We send back all parts.
Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia
This year, the ITB_Indonesia team was very happy because we could mentor one of the another university student in the lab. We mentored a student, Hilal, about the iGEM competition and several skills in the lab. We explained about plasmid isolation method of transformant bacteria, how to clone the DNA utilizing PCR, and how to analyze it using electrophoresis. And the last but not least, we helped him to know more about our project. Through this mentorship program, Hilal could learn and gain many insights from us and hopefully in the near time his university could start their own iGEM team too!
LEMIGAS
Research and Development Center for Oil and Gas Technology
Pusat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Teknologi Minyak dan Gas Bumi
This year, ITB_Indonesia project is related to the production of biosurfactant that would be utilized for EOR. Therefore, we collaborated with LEMIGAS, one of the research center in Indonesia involving in oil and gas technology. We measured the interfacial tension of our surfactant at the EOR laboratory there. LEMIGAS is also conducting research to produce surfactant for EOR application. Therefore, our project data would be useful for them. In addition, the result of the measurement seemed promising and they take interest in our project.
