Reporter Module
We want to make our system to be easily observed. Using RFP under Lac promoter, the culture will turn red during rhamnolipid production. When the lactose is exhausted, the colour will fade, telling use that additional inducer (lactose) is needed to continue the production. We use RFP with LVA tag designed by Edinburgh 2014 to make the reporter has fast turnover. But because RFP measurement need fluorescence spectrophotometer, we try to use chromoprotein as reporter. Using the tag designed by Edinburgh 2014 , we designed tagged aeBlue protein and tested its turnover.
