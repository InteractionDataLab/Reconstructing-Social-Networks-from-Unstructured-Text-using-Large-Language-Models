Hopefully, this brief study could provide the fellow iGEM teams or other teams in the future a brief and general knowledge about EOR in Indonesia and the world.</P><H2>Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) Study</H2><SECTION><DIV class="img-caption" style="float:right; display:inline-block; margin-top:0;"><SPAN><B>Fig. 1</B> Typical injection oil wells<SUP>[4]</SUP></SPAN></DIV><P>One of the main source of energy in the world is the utilization of oil and gas. Thus, many efforts have been taken to increase the production of oil and gas by many companies. There are three phases in oil recovery, primary, secondary, and tertiary (enhanced) recovery. Firstly, the companies would use the primary and secondary recovery the oil field. However, the utilization of tertiary recovery is inevitable in the future<SUP>[1]</SUP>. In the US, however, producers have attempted several Enhance Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques to increase the production of oil, from 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir’s original oil in place, higher than primary and secondary recovery<SUP>[2]</SUP>.
EOR technologies could be grouped into the following categories<SUP>[3]</SUP></P><P><STRONG>Thermal EOR (TEOR)</STRONG>
This method utilizes cyclis steam and hot water injection, steam and hot water flooding, and (rarely) the in-situ combustion of hydrocarbons. The principle of TEOR is to reduces the viscosity of the oil sufficiently by heat to enable it to be recovered. 
</P><P><STRONG>CO2-EOR</STRONG>
This method was more recently applied compared to the TEOR and is also the fastest growing EOR application.
</P><P><STRONG>Other gas EOR</STRONG>
The other gas used for this method is the hydrocarbon and nitrogen. Generally, this method is not cost-effective in the U.S. and is expected to continue to decline over the next decade.
</P><P><STRONG>Chemical/Microbial EOR</STRONG>
This method involves the addition of chemical or microbial agents to the reservoir to modify the fluid properties, thus the oil recovery is more favorable. The principal chemical EOR methods include injection of polymers, alkaline chemicals, or surfactants.

<H3>Chemical EOR among OPEC Countries</H3><P>If we are talking about technology to enhance oil production then we can’t exclude OPEC member countries. According to OPEC’s Annual Statistical Bulletin, OPEC members has  81% of world’s crude oil reserves at the end of 2014. As we can se in Figure 1, among OPEC countries Venezuela ranks first with 299,95 bb (billion barrels) oil crude reserve (24,9%),  followed by Saudi Arabia with 266,58 bb (22,1%), Iran with  157,53 bb (13,1%), Iraq with 143,07 bb (11,9%), Kuwait with 101,50 bb (8,1%), and Uni Emirate Arab with 98,7 bb (8,1%)<SUP>[6]<SUP>.</SUP></SUP></P><DIV class="img-caption"><SPAN><B>Fig. 2</B> OPEC proven oil crude service<SUP>[6]</SUP></SPAN></DIV><STRONG>Venezuela</STRONG><P>Venezuela as the country that has the biggest oil crude reserve is dominated by heavy oil sand reservoir. Because of the lithology, Venezuela currently using thermal EOR and hydrocarbon gas injectors though still having limited succsess in EOR.  Further research on lithology and oil fields’s characteritics ia needed by venezuela to explore and develop opportunity to chemical EOR<SUP>[7]<SUP>.</SUP></SUP></P><STRONG>Iran</STRONG><P>According to research that already conducted, Irani oil industry payed more attention to gas injection but received poor sweep effeciency. Water flooding alternative has been conducted either, but only few and cost too high . According to EOR Technology Market Forecast 2012-2022, Iranian EOR Technology forecast is increasing <SUP>[8],[9]<SUP>.</SUP></SUP></P><STRONG>Iraq</STRONG><P>In Iraq, some studies has done to describe reservoir’s rock and fluid properties in the oil fields and what kind of EOR technology fits each oil fields. Until now, 78% of EOR project done in Iraq is thermal and chemical EOR . Both thermal EOR and surfanctant EOR used for enhancing production of light oil. Some of oil fields that predicted to fit chemical EOR in Iraq are Bai-hassn, Majnoon, Buzurgan, and Nour. There are also research on chemical properties needed in surfactant to be used in EOR technology . To be brief, Iraq’s EOR technology is getting more attention, opening opportunity for chemical EOR (especially surfactant ) to develop<SUP>[10],[11]<SUP>.</SUP></SUP></P><H3>Summary</H3><P>With all of its potential of oil crude reserves, OPEC countries has not been advanced in EOR technology. Further research about oil fields characteristics and review of preceeding EOR technology process is needed. But, OPEC countries is open and on their way to improve their tertiary oil recovery.  </P><DIV class="img-caption"><SPAN><B>Fig. 3</B> Number of EOR project worldwide<SUP>[7]</SUP></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="img-caption"><SPAN><B>Fig. 4</B> EOR projects percentages (Alvarado and Manrique 2010)<SUP>[10]</SUP></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="img-caption"><SPAN><B>Fig. 5</B> Lithology distribution for EOR projects (Alvarado and Manrique 2010)<SUP>[10]</SUP></SPAN></DIV><P>
