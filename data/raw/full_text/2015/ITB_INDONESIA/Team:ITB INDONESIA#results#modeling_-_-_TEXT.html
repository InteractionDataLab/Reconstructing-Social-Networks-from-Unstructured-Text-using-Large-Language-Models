Modeling Results
Initially, we wanted to design a rhamnolipid production system that has rhamnolipid-producing enzyme under trp promoter and has a nitrogen sensor. We modelled the cell growth and rhamnolipid production based on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It turnt out that the system doesn't behave as we wanted. The rhamnolipid production started when the nitrogen is exhausted, therefore the production and reporter devices would be on at the same time.
We changed our system into much simpler one, utilising T7 promoter with lac operator. We expressed GFP under the same promoter and measured the intensity. We used this data to calculate the synthesis of our enzymes, rhlA and rhlB. Finally we used this data to calculate the rhamnolipid production.
