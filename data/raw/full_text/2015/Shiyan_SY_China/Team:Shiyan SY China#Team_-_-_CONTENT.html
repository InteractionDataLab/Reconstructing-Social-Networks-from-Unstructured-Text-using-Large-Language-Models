From my perspective, the coolest thing of science is that I can obtain much knowledge about the nature through experiments and studies. In our team, I take charge of the experimental parts with three other team members. I learned a lot from the lab and I plan to try to have more opportunities to study in chemistry or biology labs. 
</DIV></LI><LI><DIV class="text">I am Kechun Zhao.I'm doing iGEM because I can develop some interests. I'm interested in biology and chemistry. I love doing experiments.

The first time I heard about iGEM and Synthetic Biology was when my friend was promoting the iGEM a few months ago. Although I had always been weak in Biology in school, I had to admit that Synthetic Biology was attractive and iGEM was a cool platform to learn and compete. Therefore, I joined this team.I am responsible for the things beside the Biology such as the making of the wiki.</DIV></LI></UL></DIV><P style="font-weight: bold;"> Our Team Pictures:</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="sc"><DIV class="mainTitleHeader"><A name="t2"><P style="font-weight: bold;">Team Instructors</P></A></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV class="mainContainer"><DIV style="height:195px;"><DIV style="font-size:16px;">Dr.Mingkai Xu, obtained phD degree in Microbiology from the Institute of Applied Ecology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction. </P></DIV><P>For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
</P><P>What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
</P><P>We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.
