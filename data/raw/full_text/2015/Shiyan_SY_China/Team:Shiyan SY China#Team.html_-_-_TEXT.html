You have to believe in yourself. That’s the secret of success.

Team Members
 
The team Shiyan_SY_China constitutes by our nine students and five tutors such as Dr. Xu Mingkai to instruct and help us. Some of us own deep interest in biology, some are enthusiastic about mathematics, some are interested in music and sports, also some are experts at making the software and studying intensively. We utilize our curiosity and energy to construct our team. Thanks to all the people who have helped us, without them, we couldn’t explore a new and interesting field.
I am Chu Jinyan,I participate in the iGEM for challenging myself to form my leadership and to achieve some first hand experiences about biology experiments and software making. Due to the admiration of doing experiments, I own the desire to be a scientist. I am the leader of students group and the administrator of the software part in our team, and also a participator of the biology experiment.
I am Liu Yiyang, one of the members of the Shenyang_SY_China team and the leader of the experiment group in our team. As I have great enthusiasm in Biology and want to achieve more knowledge about gene engineering, I take part in the IGEM. I love Biology so much that I decide to devote my lifetime to experiments and research.I learn a lot about teamwork and confirm my will to dedicate to Biology.
My dream is to be a scientist in the future because I really love chemistry and biology. From my perspective, the coolest thing of science is that I can obtain much knowledge about the nature through experiments and studies. In our team, I take charge of the experimental parts with three other team members. I learned a lot from the lab and I plan to try to have more opportunities to study in chemistry or biology labs.
I'm doing iGEM because I can develop some interests. I'm interested in biology and chemistry. I love doing experiments. I think I can achieve more experience in iGEM. I can have more friends with the same interest, and I learn how to work with others.I love drawing and dancing and insist in doing them.In our group, I am responsible for experiments and art designing.In the future, I want to be a scientist.
I am Chen Sijian. By joining the IGEM competition, I hope that my programming skills, html and javascrip, will be developed.Second, my interest and dream is to construct robots which bases on the solid foundation of programming.Resulting from the reason above,I think that I am supposed to attend the competition.I am the website engineer of our team.I would like to be a website engineer in the future.
At the beginning, I was very interested in computer programming as well as this group lack of this kind of talents. I joined IGEM competition.Although I would sacrifice my entertainment time, I could exercise myself and do one’s bit for group. Regard to auspices, I know I need to positive to contact other people and sometimes I would suffer some difficulties. But I will overcome it and to achieve fund for the group.
Jiacong Gu, the art editor of our team SHIYAN_SY_CHINA. I'm responsible for designing promotional posters as well as doing art-related work which is my ideal things to do in the future. To strengthen friendship with other team members, to promote my own skills during cooperation and to acquire the inspiration brought by combination of science and art are what I hope to gain from attending this competition.
Thanks to iGEM, I can further develop my interests about html. Besides, I have also received social practical experience during the process of promoting iGEM to the public, which is the reason for me to join the iGEM competition.I'm in charge of making parts of the team's home page. Moreover, I am also be responsible for the promotion of the iGEM to the public.As a high school student, I want to choose programming related major in my college study.
Hi, I am Pai Qu from Liaoning Province Shiyan High school. The first time I heard about iGEM and Synthetic Biology was when my friend was promoting the iGEM a few months ago. Although I had always been weak in Biology in school, I had to admit that Synthetic Biology was attractive and iGEM was a cool platform to learn and compete. Therefore, I joined this team.I am responsible for the things beside the Biology such as the making of the wiki.

Basic division of work:
Chu Jinyan: captain, organizing a team, experimental group, wiki design, human practice
Liu Yiyang: leader of experimental group, main debater, human practice
Zhao Fanglin: leader of defense group, member of experimental group, human practice
Zhao Kechun: IDEA of project, member of experimental group, human practice, sponsor
Dai Zhehao: leader of software group, human practice, sponsor
Zhu Rui: human practice, (lecture, Sojump survey, etc.), software group
Chen Sijian: human practice,( magazine production), software group
Qu Pai: human practice, software group
Gu Jiacong: art designing, design, banner, poster
Specific division of work:
IDEA of project: All members of experimental group discussed freely about the project. By the way of brainstorming, we upset impossible arguments and confirmed the direction which we were really interested in and the goal could be achieved. Each of us made his contribution no matter which division of work he hold a post in.
Project design： Dr. Xu Mingkai, who supervised us in completing project design. With his help, we made a better understanding of principles of project and experimental methods.
Project: Liu Yiyang, Chu Jinyan, Zhao Fanglin and Zhao Kechun, members of experimental group, instructed by Dr. Xu Mingkai, did their experiments in the Institute of Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
WIKI: Guided by teacher Wang Zhichao, Dai Zhehao, Chen Sijian, Zhu Rui, Qu Pai, members of software group finished working on wiki. Every student from  experimental group made efforts to improve their website content.
Human Practice: All members participated in it to make contributions.
Sponsor: Dai Zhehao, Zhao Kechun

Collaborations
We really appreciate LZU-China’s help in 2015’s iGEM competition. LZU-China is a team supported by Lanzhou University which is the best university in the northwestern region of China, ranking as one of the top 30 among over 1,500 universities across China. And they have taken part in the last 2 years’ iGEM competition. This year, they mentored us and shared their competition experience with us. They provide many valuable suggestions which are about the presentation, the wiki design and the parts construction.
For example, they provided many useful advises for the construction of parts. We are HS team so that we do not have much experience in genetic engineering. LZU-China helped us to solve many problems we met like selecting the clone, assembling the plasmid.
What’s more, they pointed an important mistake for us, which made us avoid adding a wrong part, and told us many things about the part shipping. We completed the part submission form with their assistance. They helped to choose the suitable Part ID and told us how to fill in the Registry.
We are particularly grateful to International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC). Dr. Mao Yong helped us to understand match process and how to enter for it in our preparatory phase. And igem team from Tianjing University, which presented handbook to us by post.
