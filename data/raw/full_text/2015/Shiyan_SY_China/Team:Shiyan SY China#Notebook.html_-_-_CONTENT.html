It was the first time we heard about iGEM and became interested in it. We wanted to involved into this competition to test our ability and challenge our limits.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> December, 2014 </H><P>
We sought advice from International Teenage Competition and Communication Center (ITCCC), where Dr. Mao Yong suggested us that we should establish a team and find a suitable lab or build a high school lab by ourselves.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> January, 2015 </H><P>
We discussed with our teacher about building a competition team for iGEM. Although strongly supported by Zhang Shuang, teacher of international department of Liaoning Province Shiyan High School, we can’t build a lab in our high school. Therefore, we need to find a lab outside.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> February, 2015 </H><P>
It took so much money to build a lab by ourselves and our school doesn’t have the resource to do so either. So we turned to life science department of Liaoning University for help in February. Professor Wang Qiuyu learned what we wanted, how we loved biology, math and modeling and our wishes to get opportunities to put the theory of synthetic biology into practice. He support our idea and approved that we work together with his team to study synthetic biology.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> March, 2015 </H><P>
We used Weibo, QQ and posters to recruit members into our team. Finally we have a team of nine. We divided up work based on individual’s specialty. Some liked biology, some loved math, and also some preferred software. Together, we are IGEM team shiyan_SY_China.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> April, 2015 </H><P>
We brainstormed projects in the whole April. We checked past IGEM projectsrace and selected topics which we were truly interested in. Each of us picked 4 or 5 interested topics, which varied from environmental protection, sewage treatment, fat degradation, glowing and power-saving yeast to biodegradable plastics. But teacher Wang warned us that those experiments would be too hard to be finished.
</P><P>
We seized an opportunity to visit a lab in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and discovered a more valuable field for research, food safety! We received explicit support from Dr. Xu Mingkai, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who finally agreed to be our director . Until now, we got another lab in higher standard with more advanced facilities.
</P><P>
At the end of April, we confirmed our project and divided 9 of us into experimental and software group. Meantime, we began wiki design and scheme. Soon, we decided to work on a special issue about iGEM together with magazine World.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> May, 2015 </H><P>
To get safer food, we decided to create an engineered bacteria to degrade farm chemicals, . So when to degrade farm chemicals? What kinds of farm chemicals were sprayed on the vegetable and fruit? Were there any residues? Through investigation on a bigger scale, we found the problem of excessive farm chemicals were so severe that would drop the quality of vegetable and fruit. Nearly 70% of farm chemicals was pesticides. Organophosphorus insecticides accounted for 70%, and 70% of them were supertoxic with high-persistent pesticides.
</P><P>
We were going to edit plasmid in E. colito solve the issue of over dosed pesticide residue.
</P><P>
Would the secondary pollution becaused ? Teacher Xu Mingkai suggested that we could design the segment to make the engineered bacteria suicide. Thus, the secondary pollution wouldn’t show up. We found OPDA enzyme and ccdB in the plasmid repository of iGEM useful to us. On May 11th, we entrusted BGI with total gene sequences synthesis of F1 and F4.
</P><H style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;"> June, 2015 </H><P>
We contacted with director in IDT Beijing office, the official partner of iGEM. We confirmed the sequences of designed, synthesis methods and time, and placed the order to IDT. The ordered synthesized by BGI arrived in Shenyang. We set out to do preliminary work.
</P><P>
The first step we took is to discuss special IGEM issue on World, covering a wide range of matters about ethnic principles, advantages and disadvantages, safety of synthetic biology.
</P><P>
We had revised our project in June.

（2015-08-11）Validation of DNA sequencing of positive plasmids in Sanger way:
</P><P>Picked up three positive plasmids and delivered them to BGI in Beijing to be sequenced. To ensure the correct sequencing results, way of “bidirectional measure” was applied in the two groups of primers:</P><P>F1F：CCGGAATTCTTTACGGCTA</P><P>F4R：CAACTGCAGTTATATTCCCCAG</P><P>VF2：tgccacctgacgtctaagaa</P><P>VR：attaccgcctttgagtgagc</P><P>Sequence primers:</P><P>Results of sequencing proved clone were correct.</P></DIV><DIV align="center"><P>Figure 18.

Eight modules in the website (wiki) were on their way；The first draft of magazine had been set typed. We then proofread the content and layout once more.</P><P>We handed in the project overview in August, Final Safety Form  and chose tracks for competition. After reviewing, we re-organized into experimental group, defense and software group, which were in the charge of Liu Yiyang, Zhao Fanglin and Dai Zhehao.</P><P style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold;">
September, 2015
</P><P>We started to prepare the judge form, PPT and poster. Banner has been submitted. We are going to work on the final checkup of the Wiki.</P><P>Work on the final preparation for the competition: make uniform shirts, book airline tickets and hotel; simulate defense.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV class="footer"><P>© 2015 Shiyan_SY_China iGEM Team.
