See the lists below for how each criterion was met.</P><H3>Bronze</H3><OL><LI>
                Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
                <P>This <A href="https://igem.org/Team.cgi?id=1869">Santa Clara team</A> is officially registered for iGEM. The team had a fantastic summer and will attend the Jamboree.</P></LI><LI>
                Complete the Judging form.
                <P>Done.</P></LI><LI>
                Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
                <P>The description of the project can be found on the team <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara">wiki</A>.Documentation of the parts can be found on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (see the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Parts">Parts</A> page for links to each part).</P></LI><LI>
                Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
                <P>The team will present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.</P></LI><LI>
                Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. 
                <P>This may be found on the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Attributions">Attributions</A> page.</P></LI><LI>
                Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
                <P>Two basic BioBrick parts were made in this project: CFA synthase (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1869000">BBa_K1869000</A>) and SAM synthetase (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1869001">BBa_K1869001</A>).</P></LI></OL><H3>Silver</H3><OL><LI>
                Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
                <P>A composite BioBrick Part was made in this project and experimentally verified: pLac::RBS::CFA synthase (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1869002">BBa_K1869002</A>).</P></LI><LI>
                Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.)
                <P>The composite part above has been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry.</P></LI><LI>
                iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
                <P>See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Practices">Practices</A> page for projects beyond the bench.</P></LI></OL><H3>Gold</H3><OL><LI>
                Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
                <P>See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Practices">Practices</A> page for details of how the design of the project was informed by our Human Practices activity.</P></LI><LI>
                Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
                <P>See the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Collaborations">Collaborations</A> page for details of our team's assistance with the projects of other iGEM teams.</P></LI></OL><UL class="pager"><LI class="previous"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Santa_Clara/Results"> Results
