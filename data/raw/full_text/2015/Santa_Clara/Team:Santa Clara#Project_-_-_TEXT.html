This is an example of a two-column using the convenient Bootstrap grid system (you can read about it on w3schools).
You can add multiple rows for displaying diffent content (or we can use an accordion system that you see on the Notebook page).
Note that the columns can be of equal width (as seen in the first row) or of different widths (as seen in the second row).
Also, no styling has been applied yet (text/image centering, background colors, etc). This will be added soon.
Some text can go below the image (like a caption).
Header for second column
The second column is a great place for more text!
Header for first column
You can also alternate the images and text between the columns to create a pleasant visual effect.
Here, the text is in the first column and the image is in the second column.
Text below second image.
Of course, you can still use the traditional one-column format.
