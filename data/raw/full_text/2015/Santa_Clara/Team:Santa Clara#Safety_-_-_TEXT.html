Safety
At Santa Clara University we have high standards health and safety for students, faculty and staff. We uphold the values strictly and strive to keep the university community safe. The Environment Health and Safety Departmentâ€™s (EHS) mission is to: "support and advance the teaching, learning and research activities of the University through promotion of a safe and healthy campus environment by providing and coordinating programs and services that minimize safety, health, environmental and regulatory risks to the SCU community. The Environment, Health and Safety Department work to:
Provide a safe campus learning and work environment
Ensure a process of regulatory compliance

Our Project
Biological Chassis: Escherichia Coli
Sterile Equipment was used when dealing with E. Coli
All disposables in contact with E. Coli were sterilized via autoclaving to kill all live remnants.
Sterile Technique
All glassware, tips, consumables, and culture medias were autoclaved before use to prevent contamination.
Autoclave is only used by students who are autoclaved trained by Biology Prep Room Staff.
Proper Protective gear must be worn when using autoclave to prevent harm to user.
Part Use
All parts used/created are inherently/work in bacteria to no harm to the host or to humans if contamination occurs.
In Gel Dye Substitution
Traditional DNA visualization on agarose gels is accomplished through Ethidium Bromide. Ethidium bromide is a carcinogenic chemical and needs to be disposed of in special manners.
Instead a synthetic in gel dye was used to visualize DNA instead of Ethidium bromide. This allowed for no special waste or care.
Gel Red can be purchased here
