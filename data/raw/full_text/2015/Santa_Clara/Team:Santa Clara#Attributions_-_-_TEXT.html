Throughout this project we were working independently of professors and faculty advice.  From start to finish we built the project ourselves.  We conducted the background research and carried out experiments within our own ability.  Any help from faculty or professors was all conceptual in troubleshooting protocols and experiments.  The Policy and Practice was done by law students without the advice or guidance of professors.  They reached out to other teams and established everything on their own.In it's entirety this is a completely and solely student built project.
We have many people we would like to thank for their help in the design, execution and support of this project.  These groups and individuals offered a helping hand as we maneuvered through our first year competing in iGem.  So from our entire team to all of you we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Santa Clara University Provost Office
We would like to thank the Provost office for funding our endeavors for our project this year.  Without their help we would not have been able to transform our idea into reality.
School of Engineering
A special thank you to the School of Engineering for kick starting us and allowing us to be nestled under their wing to facilitate building of our team and project. Specifically the Dean Godfrey Mungal for believing in us from the very beginning.
Bioengineering Department
Thank you to the bioengineering depart for their support and use of facilities as we worked this past summer on our project.
Linda Kahl
Linda has been a great help in the entirety of the planning of our project from the very beginnings to the very end.  Thank you for all your help and sharing this experience with us.
Tracy Ruscetti and Christelle Sabatier
Dr. Ruscetti and Dr. Sabatier of the Biology Department have been a great help with the design and troubleshooting of our project.  Without them we would not have been able to complete as much as the project as we did.
Biology Prep Room Staff
We would like to extend a huge thank you to the biology prep room staff. They graciously allowed us to use their space and equipment, and offered support for our project. They also assisted us with ordering everything we needed for our project. In addition we would like to thank the Bioengineering Lab Manger Adrian Valones, not pictured, for his assistance with ordering as well. If it were not for these people we would not have been able to successfully complete our project this year.
Jonathan Zhang
Dr. Zhang has been a great advisor as we work through all the problems along the way.  He has been there through all the planning, frustration, and joy as we completed our project.
Bill Mains
Without Professor Mains we would not have had the opportunity to compete in iGem this year.  He approached us and asked if we would like to be a part of this wonderful opportunity.  Because of that we are where we are now.
Friends and Family
Lastly without the support system of our family and friends none of us would be where we are today. Their love and moral support has kept us afloat through the rough times and they were there to celebrate with us when we succeeded.  Thank you for everything.
Sponsors
The last group we would like to thank is our sponsors. These companies allowed us to pursue our project to the fullest through funding and other support systems.
