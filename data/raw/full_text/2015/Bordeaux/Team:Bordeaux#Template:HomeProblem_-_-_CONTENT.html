In fact, Aquitaine is one of the 4 regions which produces the most wine. However, vineyards are threatened by an oomycete called <B><I> Plasmopara viticola </I></B>, otherwise known as <B>Downy Mildew </B> which affects the quality of wine by causing irreparable damages to grapevine organs.  This microorganism infects the grapevine’s tissues, particularly it's leaves, draining the plant’s resources and preventing its photosynthetic capacities. </H6><H6 align="justify"> The most common preventive treatment used by vineyards in the region is called <B> « bouillie bordelaise » </B> and is composed of <B> copper sulfate </B>, a product which has <B> toxic effects </B> on the surrounding soil. Although this treatment is efficient and does help to protect the plant from harmful microorganisms, this  method  has a  <B> bad environmental  and  sanitary impact </B> since the copper present in the treatment infiltrates in the ground and prevents the growth of other types of plants, therefore impacting the biodiversity of the region. Furthermore,  long term contact with these chemical components can  create symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or renal/hepatic dysfunctions for those living in these contaminated areas.</H6><H6><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bordeaux/Problem"> click here for more information on the problem of mildew in the Aquitaine region </A></H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
