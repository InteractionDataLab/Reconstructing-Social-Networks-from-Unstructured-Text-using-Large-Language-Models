More than 850 million bottles are sold every year and a economy of more than € 3.7 billion. Today, the red wines represent 86% of total volumes produced by the vineyards of Bordeaux, 89% of exports in volume and 92% in value. 
 The Bordeaux vineyard now covers 123,000 hectares for 270,000 hectares of farmland. Soils and Girondins basements are rather shallow. The Gironde, the Garonne and the Dordogne soften the climate and meet the water needs of the vineyard. Found on the left bank of the Gironde and Garonne gravelly, sandy, clay, from the erosion of the Pyrenees. On the right banks, soils are likely limestone and limestone. The warm ocean current of the Gulf Stream accentuates the temperate climate and the Landes forest forms a protective shield against the winds of the ocean. 
 We can find lots of grapes : 
   Reds: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot. 
 Whites: Sauvignon, Semillon, Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, Colombard.
 Apart from small local names among the most famous, all other larger in size, occur depending on the vintage, more or less significant quantities of Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur. </P><H6> Some mildew key figures </H6><P align="justify"><B>15 </B>  is , on average, the number of treatments that had to make a winemaker in 2012 to fight against mildew.

 Over the last 20 years, no less than 3 mildew epidemics were recorded in France . These outbreaks have a direct impact on the production of wine. As shown in the graph below,  represents the number of hL (millions) produced over time , production in 1998 , 2001 and 2006 dropped by over 50 % compared to previous years.
  </P><P align="justify"> In 2010, each hectar or grapevine had received around 16 chemical treatments (this number was 15 in 2006) and varies greatly between regions. Amongst the biological threats on grapevine, mushroom parasites are far ahead of insects and fungi (12 fungicides are used against 2 insecticides and 2 weedkillers). Over 95% of the fongicide treatments in 2010 were due to mildew and oidium, sicknesses that are favorized by rain, humidity and heat. They bring the global quality of the wine down by reducing it's composition in phenols and sugars. 
 The risc of contamination on the leaves begin during the period where the floral buds and futur grapes are growing and lasts until the moment when the grapes touch each other. The sensibility period between oidium and mildew have common momments and vinyards don't heasitate to mix anti-mildew and anti-oidium solutions making the concentrations of these chemicals twice more concentrated in the grounds.
 Downy mildew requires optimum conditions to reproduce and infect. A warm, moist, and humid environment is required. Studies in Sicily have shown optimum time for oospore germination is between the end of February and the middle of March. With this understanding, if fungicides are used just before these conditions occur, and have proven to be efficient measures. Other methods include proper watering, and a good location where the plant can receive continual sunlight. </P><P> What are the problems with these treatments ?

This allowed us to speak to the producers on how much their production is threatened by oomycetes such as mildew and to see if they would eventually be interested in an alternative preventive solution that would be eco-friendly. At the same time, this allowed us to search for sponsors in the region to raise money for our lab work. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><P> to be continued ... </P><P> Read more at <A href="http://www.lavigne-mag.fr/actualites/bordeaux-enquete-sur-une-attaque-imprevue-de-mildiou-105408.html#JrRQ87eWGid6OCFo.99"> LaVigne Mag </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
