In some cases, during the use of ethidium bromide, nitrile gloves are mandatory. Other experiments must be conducted with safety glasses.

Most products used are classified as non-hazardous (even for the sulfation protocol). Chemical products are just irritants and so handle it with gloves. In the lab, there is a specific solvent cabinet for liquid wastes. </P><P align="justify"> • Moreover, all biological waste will be autoclaved before disposal. All work is done on benches or under open-front hoods. </P><P align="justify"> • We worked with non-toxic organisms as <I> Escherichia coli </I>(BL21) and <I> Saccharomyces cerevisiae </I>(Invsc1) but, all waste that has been in contact with bacteria was put to bacterial waste in aseptic conditions. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
