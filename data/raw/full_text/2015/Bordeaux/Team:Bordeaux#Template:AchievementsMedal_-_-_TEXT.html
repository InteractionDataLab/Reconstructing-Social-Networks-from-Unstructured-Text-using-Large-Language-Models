Attributions
Wiki support: Our wiki is based on Evry's 2014 wiki
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project. The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others. For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.

Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part main page.
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. This working part must be different to the part documented in bronze medal criteria
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Your part must be different to the submission for Bronze medal criteria #6 (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Your activity could center around education, public engagement, public policy issues, public perception or other activities (See the human practices hub for more information and examples of previous teams exemplary work).
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative human practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the human practices hub for information and examples of previous teams comprehensive and innovative activities).
Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Improve the function OR characterization of an previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year of the iGEM competition) and enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your 2015 part range.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions (biological materials may not be taken outside the lab).
