Teams work with students and advisors from the humanities and social sciences to explore topics concerning ethical, legal, social, economic, safety or security issues related to their work. Consideration of these Human Practices is crucial for building safe and sustainable projects that serve the public interest. For more information, please see the Practices Hub. </P><P align="justify"> Some Human Practices topic areas

You'll find in this section a preview of what we did this year </H6><H5 align="left"> Cap Sciences </H5><P align="left"> Cap sciences is an animations center in Bordeaux, open to all which tries to help people discover and understand scientific phenomenons, new technologies and their industrial applications. They try to make science accessible to everyone and to engage a large variety of people in scientific activities. They were glad to hear about our project and we have been in contact with them all throughout the year, presenting what we've done on popularization. Here is a link to an interview we had with them at the beginning of the year: </P><P> ----- </P><A align="left" href="http://videos.cap-sciences.net/Mediasite/Play/211e36530d4041b6b5b349f20c00ab5a1d?catalog=b54db14b-e6b2-4b65-8c9c-cdc78683d9a2&amp;playFrom=1926&amp;autoStart=true"> Watch our interview!</A><P> ----- </P><P> ----- </P><P align="left"> This partnership also pushed us to go talk to people on the street to understand where their fear of genetically modified organisms comes from and to raise awareness on what is being done nowadays with synthetic biology in our everyday life. Caroline, Charlotte, Gilles and Diego spent a few afternoons in the streets of Bordeaux trying to get in contact with walkers. These conversations tought us that in Bordeaux the main concern about GMO's is that people are unaware about what they really are and the possibilities that synthetic biology offer us. Furthermore it made us start to realize the importance of scientific communication and for the need to think about our project from an ethical and safety point of view. For more information on the questions we asked ourselves please see the Ethics page! </P><P> SURVEY TO PUT HERE </P><P> . </P><H5 align="left"> Presentation of Synthetic Biology in Lycée Montesquieu </H5><P align="justify"> IGEM Bordeaux also wanted to raise teenager's awareness of synthetic biology. On 2015, May, 21st, Jean, Savandara and Lily made a presentation of synthetic biology at the school &quot;Lycée Montesquieu&quot; in Bordeaux, showing its interest by giving some interesting applications. </P><P> . </P><H5 align="left"> Lab Life </H5><P align="justify">After a few years of thinking about it, our game is finally going to be created physically.
