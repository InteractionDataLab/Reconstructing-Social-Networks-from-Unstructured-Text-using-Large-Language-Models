More than 850 million bottles are sold every year and  worth almost € 3.7 billion. Today, the red wines represent 86% of total volumes produced by the vineyards of Bordeaux, 89% of exports in volume and 92% in value. 
The Bordeaux vineyard now covers 123,000 hectares for 270,000 hectares of farmland. The climate and the terroir is particulary favourable for a exceptionnal vineyard. Indeed, soils and Girondins basements are rather shallow. The Gironde, the Garonne and the Dordogne make the climate cool and provide the water needed by the vineyard. On the left side of the Gironde and Garonne, there is  gravelly, sandy, clay soil made by the erosion of the Pyrenees. On the other side, soils are likely limestone wich is suitable for vineyard. The warm ocean current of the Gulf Stream accentuates the temperate climate and the Landes forest forms a protective shield against the winds of the ocean. </P><P align="justify" style="text-indent: 3vw;">  One of the caracteristics of the bordeaux vineyard is the great diversity of the grape variety, we can find lots of grapes :
 Reds: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot. 
 Whites: Sauvignon, Semillon, Muscadelle, Ugni Blanc, Colombard.

        </P><P align="justify" style="text-indent: 3vw;">  Treatments against mildew have a cost that varies between <B> € 50,000 and € 164,000 per year.Over the last 20 years, no less than 3 mildew epidemics were recorded in France . These outbreaks have a direct impact on the production of wine. As shown in the graph below, represents the number of hL (millions) produced over time , production in 1998 , 2001 and 2006 dropped by over 50 % compared to previous years.

  </B></P><P align="justify" style="text-indent: 3vw;">  In 2010, each hectar or grapevine had received around 16 chemical treatments (this number was 15 in 2006) and varies greatly between regions. Amongst the biological threats on grapevine, mushroom parasites are far ahead of insects and fungi (12 fungicides are used against 2 insecticides and 2 weedkillers). Over 95% of the fongicide treatments in 2010 were due to mildew and oidium, sicknesses that are favorized by rain, humidity and heat. They bring the global quality of the wine down by reducing it's composition in phenols and sugars. The risc of contamination on the leaves begin during the period where the floral buds and futur grapes are growing and lasts until the moment when the grapes touch each other. The sensibility period between oidium and mildew have common momments and vinyards don't heasitate to mix anti-mildew and anti-oidium solutions making the concentrations of these chemicals twice more concentrated in the grounds. </P><P align="justify" style="text-indent: 3vw;">  Downy mildew requires optimum conditions to reproduce and infect. A warm, moist, and humid environment is required. Studies in Sicily have shown optimum time for oospore germination is between the end of February and the middle of March. With this understanding, if fungicides are used just before these conditions occur, and have proven to be efficient measures. Other methods include proper watering, and a good location where the plant can receive continual sunlight. </P><P align="justify"><B> Reference </B>:  <A href=" http://www.oenologie.fr"> www.oenologie.fr </A> / <A href="http://www.vins-bordeaux-negoce.com"> www.vins-bordeaux-negoce.com </A> / <A href="http://www.vignevin.com"> www.vignevin.com </A> / <A href="http://www.vinopole.com"> www.vinopôle.com </A></P></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><H6> Business time : SWOT Analysis </H6><DIV class="col-lg-6"><P align="justify"><B>Using Strengths to take Advantage of Opportunities </B> The reproducibility of our project and the high quantities of E. coli and Saccharomyces c. are in line with the future demand of vineyards.

This allowed us to speak to the producers on how much their production is threatened by oomycetes such as mildew and to see if they would eventually be interested in an alternative preventive solution that would be eco-friendly. At the same time, this allowed us to search for sponsors in the region to raise money for our lab work. Unfortunately, since these assemblies bring together mostly the commercial team who's aim is to land big clients, our sponsoring wasn't successful.         </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION align="center"><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><H6><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Bordeaux/Team" style=" color: #FF5E00;"> About our Team ☚</A>   Previous Page .
