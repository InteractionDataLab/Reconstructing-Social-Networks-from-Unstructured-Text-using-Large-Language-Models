We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together. You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion. In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team. Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:

    Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device
    Characterize another team's part
    Debug a construct
    Model or simulating another team's system
    Test another team's software
    Help build and test another team's hardware project
    Mentor a high-school team
