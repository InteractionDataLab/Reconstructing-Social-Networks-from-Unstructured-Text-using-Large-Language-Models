All the work was done by students : wiki design , fundraising , policy and practices as all the cakes shown on social networks :) .  In order to be more efficient, we decided to divide the work in little teams. We recieved however, a lot of help all throughout the year. First, we want to thank the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology for hosting us all the year and during our internships. Denis DUPUY, our supervisor who gives us many judicious advices and Jonathan MILLET who succeeded to coexist with many team members of iGEM Bordeaux during all this summer. Our team had to use several machines which not belong to our lab. That’s why we had to collaborate many times with the neighbor labs. We hope that they enjoyed our cake as gift. ;)
Team Plant
- Marie CECILLE proposed the original idea to work on Downy Mildew since the beginning of the brainstorming sessions.
- Hiba BENMOHAMED who contacted Anthony and realized the tests on plants
- Jean-Rémy BROSSIER worked on Curdlan tests , research about grapevine natural defenses and Mildew effects.
- Charlotte MAILLOT for all the researches about plant physiology and grapevines reactions .
SPECIAL THANKS TO:
- Michel Hernould Professor Bordeaux University, UMR 1332 Fruit Biology and Pathology INRA Bordeaux. He gave us a precious advices about plant devlopment, and allowed to the team to meet Anthony Bellee in order to test the effect of Curdlan in grapevine.
- Anthony Bellee PhD student attached to INRA , SAVE unit : "UMR 1065 Santé et agroécologie du vignoble" who helped us a lot and informed us about how Downy mildew acts on grapevines, we also visited grapevines plot at INRA. Mr Bellee hosts us at his lab, and permits to our team to realize the tests with all the needed materials.
