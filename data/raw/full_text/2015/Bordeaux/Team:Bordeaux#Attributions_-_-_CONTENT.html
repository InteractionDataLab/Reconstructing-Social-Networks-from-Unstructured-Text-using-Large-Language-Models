In order to be more efficient, we decided to divide the work in little teams. We recieved however, a lot of help all throughout the year. First, we want to thank the <B>European Institute of Chemistry and Biology</B> for hosting us all the year and during our internships. Denis DUPUY, our supervisor who gives us many judicious advices and Jonathan MILLET who succeeded to coexist with many team members of iGEM Bordeaux during all this summer. Our team had to use several machines which not belong to our lab. That’s why we had to collaborate many times with the neighbor labs. We hope that they enjoyed our cake as gift. ;)
