Who is going to do all of this you ask?
Well, this year's iGEM Bordeaux's team is made up of 23 devoted students from diverse backgrounds. Whether we be from the Bordeaux University, from a biotech engineering school or from a Science Engineering school, we are all united for this unique project and are willing to give it our all to make it succeed!
In order to do so, we united our scientific knowledge and contacted various researchers to put together our protocols. At the same time, our team has spent time and energy thinking about various non-scientific aspects of our project including how to popularize scientific knowledge to raise awareness on the possibilities of synthetic biology. We have also considered throughout the project ethical and bio-safety thematics in order to insure that our protocols are not hazardous for the environment and that any genetically engineered microorganism is controled within the lab.
