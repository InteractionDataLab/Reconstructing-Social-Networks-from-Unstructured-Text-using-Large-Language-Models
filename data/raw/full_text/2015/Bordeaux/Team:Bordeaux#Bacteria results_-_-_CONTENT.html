<I>crdA, crdC, crdS </I>genes occupy a contiguous 4,948-bp region in <I>Agrobacterium sp. ATCC31749</I>.
N.B. We tried to work on these three genes. However, amplification attempts by PCR were unsuccessful for <I>crdA</I> and <I>crdC</I> genes.

So we decided to use <I>OsmY</I> promoter (BBa_J45992) characterized by MIT 2006 iGEM team which is active in stationary phase and under high osmotic pressure condition. This promoter imitates Curdlan biosynthesis in <I>E.coli</I> without the nitrogen stress.</P><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 1: Growth dependent regulation with three promoters

✵ We worked on M63 medium because a mineral salt medium is used on the literature [1]. M63 is a minimal, low osmolarity medium for <I>E.coli</I>, resulting in slower growth rate of these cells.
→ With this medium of known composition we were able to control parameters for the production of our molecule of interest.
✵We worked also on LB medium because this is the most common medium used in the laboratory.</P><P class="reference" align="left">  [1] Dae-Young J, Young-Su C. <I>  Improved production of Curdlan with concentrated cells of Agrobacterium sp. </I> Biotechnol.

As we can see, the growth is much lower in M63 than in LB medium.
✵ For LB medium, we obtained 0.8 OD after 5h.
✵ For M63 medium, 0.8 OD is obtained much later.
→ So, entire process of production goes on 2 days in LB medium and 3 days in M63 medium.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-6"><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 2: Bacteria growth in two media</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><H5 align="center"><B>LABORATORY WORK</B></H5><DIV class="col-lg-6"><H6 align="center">1.Cloning</H6><P align="justify">To achieve our Curdlan production by <I>Escherichia coli</I>, it was necessary to integrate our interest gene <I>crdS</I> controlled by the promoter <I>OsmY</I> in two types of plasmids:
           ✵ in pSB1C3 plasmid for the characterization of our biobricks 
              • <I>OsmY</I> promoter only
              • <I>crdS</I> gene only

The selection of transformed bacteria is done by chloramphenicol resistance for pSB1C3 plasmid and by ampicillin resistance for pUC plasmid. </P><P align="justify">To check that cloning work, plasmids are digested with EcoR1 and Pst1 restriction enzymes. </P><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 3:Agarose electrophoresis gel </B></P><P align="justify"><U>Figure 3.</U> As we can see, the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing <I>OsmY</I> promoter and <I>crdS</I> gene is a bit higher than the band corresponding to the piece of linearized plasmid containing <I>crdS</I> gene only. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><H6 align="center">4.Purification and Quantitative analysis</H6><P align="justify"> To obtain Curdlan, cells were chemically destroyed by NaOH and many centrifugations.
            Curdlan purification was performed by neutralization after adding acetic acid.
            Quantitative analysis was done before and after purification to compare and eliminate non significant measures (background signal). </P><P align="justify">N.B. Also, we use a polarimeter to characterize our Curdlan molecule produced. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1"><H5 align="center"><B><I>E. coli</I> CURDLAN PRODUCTION </B></H5><P align="justify">We produced some Curdlan compared to non transformed strain of <I>DH5α</I>. We analyzed data with a student test to prove our results are significant. The theoretical concentration obtained in the Control condition corresponds to the non significant measure (background signal).
        
N.B. We realized these figures by doing the average of all production results in each medium.</P><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 5: Quantitative analysis of purified Curdlan with aniline blue</B></P><P align="justify">→ Each medium can be used for the Curdlan production. But, we can’t compare these two results and say that produced Curdlan quantity is higher in LB than in M63 medium because productions are not realized at the same time in these cases.</P><P align="justify"> In following results, we have studied production in M63 and LB media started at the same time. </P><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 6: Quantitative analysis of purified Curdlan with aniline blue</B></P><P align="justify">→ Now, thanks to a statistic test, we can conclude that Curdlan production is doubled in LB medium compared to M63 medium. </P><P align="justify"> LB medium has an unknown glucose concentration contained in yeast extract whereas in M63 medium we have controled  this parameter. We suppose that LB glucose concentration is higher than in the second medium. That will be explain the difference between these two conditions. </P><P align="justify"> However, compared to <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, our results are very low: about 10 to 20µg/mL for Bacteria to  100µg/mL for Yeast. </P><P align="justify"> We have tried some optimization protocols but without success. </P><H6 align="center"> Characterization </H6><P align="justify"> Part 1. To verify <I>OsmY</I> promoter is only active in the stationary phase, we realized Curdlan quantitative analysis every hour of a culture in LB medium. The switch of temperature for the culture is linked to the transition in stationary phase. 
        → As we can see, Curdlan appears after the switch at 27°C. So, <I>OsmY</I> promoter is active in stationary phase only. <B>(Fig.7)</B></P><P class="reference" align="center"><B> Figure 7: <I>OsmY</I> promoter characterization </B></P><P align="justify"> Part 2. To verify produced molecule is Curdlan, we analysed samples with a polarimeter. The reference used was Curdlan bought to do standard range  for the quantitative analysis with aniline blue.</P><P align="justify">A substance is optically active or has a rotatory power when it deflects polarization plane of light from an <I>α</I> angle. This rotatory power is related to the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon within the molecule. All sugars (except dihydroxyacetone) are chiral molecules, so they all have a rotatory power. This property allows the polarimetric determination of sugars in pure solution thanks to the law of Biot. </P><P align="justify"> There are two types of optically active substances:
        ✵Those which deflect polarization plane of light from an <I>α</I> angle to the right. The measured angle is positive and the substance is in dextrorotatory form.
        ✵Those which deflect polarization plane of light from an <I>α</I> angle to the left. The measured angle is negative and the substance is in levorotatory form. </P><P align="justify"><U>Results</U>– Results were obtained with a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter.
