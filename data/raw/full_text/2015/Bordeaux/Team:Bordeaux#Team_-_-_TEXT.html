The C.elegans Tamer !!!!
Denis Dupuy was born in Pau, France. As a young man in Pau, Denis studied Biology at University of Pau with the hopes of becoming a career scientist by day and a Superhero by night, so he decided to do what it was necessary to accomplish his dreams. A remarkable student, he later landed his first postdoctoral dream job at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute of Boston. These dreams, however, were soon shattered when a near-fatal C.elegans accident left him without superpower. During his recuperation at Bordeaux in the U869 INSERM team, Denis heard about an International Student Synthetic Biology Competition : iGEM. Suddenly, it is the revelation, he cannot save people with his superpower. From that moment he decided to create the first Bordeaux team (like Professor Xavier in X-men), and trained some young aspiring biologists to make the world a better place. Soon, he discovered a new passion that took over his life... Denis developed a talent for PCR that was often copied, though never rivaled.

Media
Communication
During the entire year, our team did its best to get people interested in Synthetic Biology. The first step to reach this goal was to inform people of the project’s information and progresses through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Then, we promoted our project during public events such as Vinexpo (Largest international wine Congress) in Bordeaux and la Foire au vin. At these events, the team relied on flyers and a brochure to give people the objectives and the principle of Cur’dVine. The flyer we use is represented just below:
Interviews
To make people aware of the iGEM competition and to make them know our project, the team has led interviews with Bordeaux Sciences Museum, Cap Science. For more details, please look at our Policy and Practices page.
Press
All the team’s efforts have been noticed by the media in Bordeaux. It had been the case of U, the magazine of Bordeaux University, who published a paper on us on July 2015. You can read the article on link below. The team has also send press release to other media (TV, radio, news paper) Unfortunately we are still waiting for answers.
After getting the gold medal during the competition, the newpaper "Sud Ouest" interviewed us twice to relate our victory. We were also interviewed again by the University to talk about our Boston trip.
