Supervisor: Denis Dupuy
The C.elegans Tamer !!!!
At Bordeaux, our supervisor is not there to tell us what to do or even how to do it. He is there to teach us how to handle our team, how to think for ourselves and act independently. However, he has given us time and effort to make our project come to life and the whole team is greatful!

Media
Communication
During the entire year, our team did its best to get people interested in Synthetic Biology. The first step to reach this goal was to inform people of the project’s information and progresses through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Then, the promoted the project among people during public events such as Vinexpo (Largest international wine Congress) in Bordeaux. At these events, the team relied on flyers and a brochure to give people the objectives and the principle of Cur’dVine. The flyer we use is represented just below:  FLYER
To make people aware of the iGEM competition and to make them know our project, the team has led interviews with Bordeaux Sciences Museum, Cap Science. For more details, please look at our Policy and Practices page.
Press
All the team’s efforts have been noticed by the media in Bordeaux. It had been the case of U, the magazine of Bordeaux University, who published a paper on us on July 2015. You can read the article on link below. The team has also send press release to other media (TV, radio, news paper) Unfortunately we are still waiting for answers.
