To sum it up
We plan on using two host organisms: Sacharomyces cerevisiae which naturally produces Curdlan and Escherichia coli , the most common organism used for synthetic biology. Our genes will be synthethized industrially by IDT and will be inserted respectively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli with their appropriate promoters. These modified cells will then be cultivated to produce our Curdlan molecule in large quantities. The final step of our project will be to extract the curdlan molecule, to quantify our production and to sulfate the molecules if possible.
