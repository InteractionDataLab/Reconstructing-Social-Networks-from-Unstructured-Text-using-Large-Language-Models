Solution
This year, iGEM Bordeaux proposes an eco-friendly alternative treatment to prevent Downy Mildew: replacing copper sulfate by Curdlan , a sugar biopolymer which stimulates the plant's immune system . But what does that mean?
Actually, the plant naturally defends itself against pathogens through two distinct levels of immunity, a specific and non specific imunity which both cause a depolarization of the infected cell membrane and triggers the production of antimicrobial metabolites. Curdlan is recognised by the non specific immune system and activates it, with mechanisms similar to modern day vaccines.
The production of our molecule will be done using non-pathogenic micro-organisms which can easily be grown in our lab: Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These are two microorganisms commonly used in synthetic biology and that are amongst the most well known organisms on the planet.
