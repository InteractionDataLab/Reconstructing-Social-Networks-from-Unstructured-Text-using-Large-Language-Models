After production of Curdlan , we tested his effect on grapevine at INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Research) . With the help of Mr Anthony Bell√©e, our teammate applicator Curdlan to young leafs (4/5 days),and the day after she infects the leafs with Downy Mildew (see protocol page). The tests results will be available on Monday September 23th after the wiki freeze so we will present them at our presentation in Boston.
