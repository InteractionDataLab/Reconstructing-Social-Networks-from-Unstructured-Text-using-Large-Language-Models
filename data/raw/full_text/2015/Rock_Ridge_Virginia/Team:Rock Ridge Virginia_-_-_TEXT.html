Welcome to the Rock Ridge High School iGEM 2015 Wiki Page!
As a first year running iGEM team, we can't wait to see what this competition has in store for us. This summer, we have been working very hard to complete our projects while still maintaining the fun aspect of the club. We hope you enjoy our Wiki Page on all of our difficult work.
