At these events, we will present our projects as well as demonstrate different experiments that are related to synthetic biology.  We will also lead the discussion on the benefits and problems with this technology, while also organizing a science exhibition for students that live in our area, which will be used as an opportunity to explain our project.  Through this, we hope to gather support from the community. At this event, students will able to make their own take-home science projects, play around with advanced technology, and participate in many more fun and engaging activities.  Our plan is also to visit different high schools in our area and surrounding counties, through which we hope to instill a passion of iGEM in order to entice them to join in the near future.  If they do, we will help them with our knowledge, equipment and experience for the competition.</P><H2>May 1st: Brambleton Presentation:</H2>
	We got to talk with our community officials and spread awareness about our project, our first steps towards human outreach.

<H2> May 17th: Lyme 5k/10k Run </H2>

We presented our projected to our community and spread awareness about what we were doing to do against Lyme disease.




<H2> June 8th, 2015: iGEM Phoenix Stem Event: </H2>

This event was held to educate and engage interest in the fields of science, math, engineering, and technology for young students from ages 3-13. Kids were able to build rockets, make elephant toothpaste, extract DNA from strawberries-select genes so they can make their own organisms, build catapults, and much more! It was a really good way to introduce synthetic biology to a young audience. 


<H2>August 27th, 2015: We make an appearance on Loudoun Times Mirror </H2>

 This really helped get the word out and really brought us recognition and support!
