April.
We held interests meetings, talked about iGEM and brainstorms ways to get funding and brainstorm possible projects
May.
Our team was ready and we met with the Brambleton HOA, they are a bridge to our community
June
We had two projects, in case one of them does not work: Vaccine platform and the bacteria mimic. And we focus our efforts in Lyme disease,something that truly affects our area, neighbors, and family members
We reach out the Lyme 5K organization and we are able to present our project as well as to distribute information about Lyme and how to prevent it.
we kick start our fund raiser with the iGEM phoenix stem day. This was the perfect way to present our project and synthetic biology to the new wave of scientist
July
University of Maryland meet up!
We started ordering materials and reagents. Finally we can start our project!
August
Based on our conversation with UMD iGEM team we redesign and focus on one project. We decided to go forward with the bacteria mimic although it will now be called the "Living vaccine"
IDT parts arrive
Everything is moving very slow, and a lot of things are not working. Specially our transformation protocol. We contacted UMD and UVA to see if they had any competent cells that we can use for the interlab study. We've done many transformations but only a few plates are working.
the janitors waxed the floors so we could not meet for almost 4 days.
This is our most productive month, everything seems to be working, specially the transformation.
The news crew came to our lab to see our program and the iGEM program.
September
We had to stop working in the lab and focus on getting money, there are too many people that wan to go to MIT, but we can't fund raise enough money for everybody. Our mentor decided that the funding that we get will be to take students that have shown dedication to the program. <
