We would like to thank our team captains, Sneha and Gwyn for organizing the team, setting up schedules for fundraiser or team events, making and managing our team's webpage and wiki page and for making sure that team members are productive (Gwyn's nickname this summer was mom), we love you Gwyn! ;p
Vigensh is our Lab manager and he was very efficient at managing the lab's materials, making sure we always had enough DiH2O, a good resource if students needed help in that lab and making sure that our work moved forward.
Shareen was our graphics designer, she designed our logos and flag, she is very talented. Arun and Ajay are twin brothers and they helped with the design of our flayers for the team's events
Pramod was very dedicated and he did a great job optimizing the protocols we needed for the fruitfly studies.
Jakob (JJ) is our technology expert and he help set up our wiki page and he developed the app for our project.
Shrunal and Gurveer were invaluable in our lab, they probably made closed to 1000 plates, buffers, and DNA gels.
Uday was in charge of making the computer models for our project, it really gave us an insight on how our parts may work inside the bacterial cell.
Aidan, Pavan, Ajay and Arun designed and constructed our microgravity chamber. Our initial budget was $20 but it quickly rose to almost $50.
We want to thank Michelle, she is a visiting student from a nearby High School (Broad Run), she helped with the design of our hardware as well as the mathematical model, we hope she will join our group next year.
We would really like to thank Josh and the entire team of the University of Maryland iGEM team. They provided us with invaluable advice which made us revise our plans and finalize our project.
We also want to acknowledge the members of the University of Virginia iGEM team, they were always very supportive and answered any questions we had.
From our mentor: We would also like to acknowledge Kitwa from iGEM, she is very supportive, she helped us identify and locate the plasmid that we needed and has given as helpful advise for our teams registration to the Giant Jamboree.
Brambleton Home Owners Association helped us spread the word about events and fund raisers.
Loudoun Education Foundation for their help in our look for partners and sponsors
Lastly. We want to give thanks to our adviser Mario Saavedra, for guiding us throughout the summer and providing us with a great opportunity such is iGEM
