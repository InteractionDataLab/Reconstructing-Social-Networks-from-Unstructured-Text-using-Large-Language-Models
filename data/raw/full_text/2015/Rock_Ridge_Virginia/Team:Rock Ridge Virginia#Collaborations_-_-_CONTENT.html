We participated at the University of Maryland's (UMD) meet, thanks to this event were were able to meet other iGEM teams and collaborate with them</P><H4> University of Maryland </H4>

The University of Maryland iGEM team really helped point out the weakness of our initial design and they gave us suggestions based on their experience and research. Our initial project or device had 3 different proteins controlled by one promoter and they helped us redesign it so each gene is now controlled by its own promoter. From the beginning everytime we needed help they were readily available and responded quickly. 


<H4> University of Virginia </H4><P> Our first project was based on a previous project from the University of Virginia iGEM team, we were very glad to have met their team at the UMD's Meet. Through email we were able to collaborate, specially with our measurement study, they helped us navigate the different types of vectors the devices were in and what we can do to optimize our transformation to get better results. We would like to specially thank Rena for being a bridge between the two teams </P><H4> Loudoun Lyme </H4><P> Because of our project we were able to collaborate with Loudoun Lyme, an oganization dedicated to the spread of information and awareness in our region about Lyme disease.  This collaboration also gave us great exposure in our community and the iGEM program, we were glad to meet a fellow igemer from a past Duke University iGEM team. We were able to talk about Lyme disease, explain strategies on how to have a safe nature experience and show case our project. We distributed flyers with information, our booth was very popular, so much that we got the attention of NatCapLyme (National Capital Lyame Disease Association). A natinal organization dedicated to the treatment of Lyme disease. We are really looking to collaborate with NatCapLyme this coming year . </P><H4> Broad Run High School </H4>

Once we learned that Broad Run HS had an iGEM team we started collaborating with them, explaining what iGEM offers, and specially the IDT offer to all teams. They came to Rock Ridge several times and we talked about our projects and we share our accomplishments and experiences at Rock Ridge and we offer lab space for their project since they had to travel to Maryland about 1hr drive from our location. Throughout the summer we communicated and talked about lab resources, funding and ideas to get to the Giant Jamboree this year.
