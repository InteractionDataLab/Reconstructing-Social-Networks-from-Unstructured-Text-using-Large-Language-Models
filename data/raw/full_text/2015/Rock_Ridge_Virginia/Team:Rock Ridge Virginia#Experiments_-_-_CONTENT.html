We tried to use this minicell as a vaccine platform using Wolbachia Surface protein as an immunogenicity factor/adjuvant for other protein that are not very immunogenic. Our goal was to immunize animal vectors and make them immune to the Lyme bacteria. We were going to use 4 common surface proteins from Lyme: OspA, OspC, DbpA, and DbPB. We selected these proteins because based on research they are the most common protein that are expressed in the different animal vectors. Unfortunately due to the lack of resources and the need to focus, we are putting this project in our drawer for future use.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV><H3><EM>Bacteria mimic/Living vaccine</EM> project</H3><DIV><DIV class="pure-g"><DIV class="pure-u-1-2"><UL><LI>Idea
                                                </LI><LI>After researching for the vaccine platform, we realized that the only component needed for the Lyme bacteria to colonize the Tick's gut was OspA. We started brain storming as how we could use it to combat Lyme disease. We first thought of making a bacteria that can secrete the Tick Receptor of OspA protein (TROSPA), which was shown to be active and able to bind in its soluble and truncated form to the Lyme bacteria's OspA. We quickly realized that our secreted protein may not co-localized with Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme bacteria) and therefore be ineffective. This is how the idea of making a mimic came about, if we wanted our bacteria to co-localize with the Lyme bacteria then our bacteria would have to resemble Lyme. And the only protein needed to accomplish this is OspA. Through our research we also realized that this technique can potentially work for other insect born diseases. The only problem that we had was how to vertically transfer (parent to offspring) our mimic to the next generation of ticks, so they are also vaccinated against Lyme disease. We knew the key was the sex cells and we found our answer on another bacteria, a symbiot called Wolbachia. Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) is responsible for bacteria host interaction, it is the major surface protein in Wolbachia and if co-localizes well with the sex cells of female insects.
