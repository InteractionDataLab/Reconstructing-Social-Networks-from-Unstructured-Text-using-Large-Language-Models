We are Team METU_Turkey! </H3><H1>Integrated Human Practice</H1><P>We are aware that science is not just about making experiments and that science should not just be contained in a laboratory.scientific projects must shed light on the current problems of society. Another important requirement is that scientific projects work and that they remain in the limits of ethical boundaries. we as the metu igem team, kept these in mind when we came up with our project. We are aware that there is no other treatment than a complete gluten free diet. While working on our project, we made sure to inform the general public about the difficulties of living with celiac disease.</P><H1>Education &amp; Public Engagement</H1><P>Engagement As METU Turkey, we make a considerable effort to present our project and raise awareness. Firstly, we focus on making the society aware of our project, gluten detection and degredation. For this reason, the survey we have done and also video we have shot with significant amount of people are the most important parts of our human practice approach. Results of the Gluten intolerance questionnaire shows that 9.2% of surveyed people have celiac decease and these people suffer from some problems about gluten-free products. When we asked people that ‘’Should METU develop a more basic and cheap way for these gluten-free product or not?’’, 84.6% of the answers were yes. This result gives us courage to continue on our project and achieve our goals. Our video titled ‘’Gluten &amp; Gluten-free Products Awareness’’ is the second important part of our human practice work. With this video, we can see how much people know about celiac disease and in accordance with this information we can explain this disease to them. In addition to that, we had the chance to tell people about our project and all of the people we have interviewed gave us their support.</P><H1>Play our Sad_Celiac_Boy game! (Mac competible)</H1><H1>An Interview with Prof. Doctor H. Canan Sümer</H1><DIV margin="300px"><P>Prof. Doctor H. Canan Sümer graduated from METU department of psychology. After that, she got her phd from Kansas State University. Then, she started to work at METU department of psychology and she is still working there.  We asked her some questions about celiac disease because she has been diagnosed with celiac disease quite recently. We wanted to know how she deals with this disease and what can she suggest to other people who also have celiac disease. This interview shows us what patients go through before and after celiac disease diagnosis. Therefore, this interview helps us understand what celiac disease patients need, which helps us improve our project.</P></DIV><H4>When were you diagnosed with celiac disease?</H4>
About year ago, actually eleven months to be perfect.. <H4>Could you please tell what happened after diagnosis process?</H4>
They performed blood test, endoscopy and colonoscopy to diagnose me with the disease. Following the diagnosis, my doctor directed me to dietitian where I received some important information concerning my diet, but I was already prepared at time as I had already searched a number of pages and a number of groups that are available in the Internet.  <H4>What were your symptoms and signs of your diseases before diagnosis?</H4>
I felt horrible after eating certain foodstuffs. I was not able to digest them. Even if I had little to eat, I felt a fullness in my stomach. Most of the time, I felt bad after meals.<H4>Is there any treatment of your disease?</H4>

A completely gluten free diet helps you feel much better and this is what I am doing. My diet is 100% gluten free and I pay strict attention to possibility of contamination.<H4>What sort of replacements do you use regarding the products that contain gluten?</H4>

There are a number of products available. There are things like gluten free flour, breads, cookies, crackers, pasta. Most of these are available from Turkish brands. Also, I use corn and corn flour and quinoa. <H4>In Turkey, people usually prefer products including gluten such as bread, pie, and cookies. What do you do when you go to the restaurants? Is there any place which you prefer the most?</H4>

When I go to a new restaurant, I talk to the head waiter or the cook  if possible, and I explain my situation. I usually check which dishes might contain gluten. Moreover, I sometimes carry my own bread. Plus, there are gluten free restaurant in the town that I live. There is place that I like to go. They have an excellent selection of gluten free meals.  <H4>How do you prevent gluten contamination for foods that you prepared?</H4>

It is not a big deal for me, because I physically separated my kitchen. One part of my kitchen contains the gluten free food while the other part contains food that has gluten. <H4>Before and after diagnosis, which changes happened in your body?</H4>


Compared to the time before my diagnosis, I feel much more energetic. My skin is not as dry as it used to be. I regained my appetite, so I am not losing weight anymore. Also, my hair loss stopped. <H4>Is there any suggestions to celiac patients?</H4>
100% gluten free diet and nothing else. If you do that, there will not be any problems.
