Hello dear synthetic biology fans! We are METU iGEM Team members. Now you can learn more about us and our specialities. Our team consists of various people from the field of BioScience. We have spent lots of time to get prepared well! (Exactly 7/24) Everyone in this team has done all the duties and we had a very successful team work. Lastly, we are very proud to be a part of this Group & Project.
TEAM MEMBERS
İlkem Kumru
Hello dear iGEMers, it's Ilkem Kumru here, a senior student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my third year in iGEM. I am the team leader of this year's team. I take part in WetLab, P&P, Modeling, wiki designing and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM Team, where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death , and it is also the only place where I feel as immortal as my love of science.
Dorukcan Özköse
Hello all H.s.sapiens. My name is Dorukcan Özköse and I'm a junior student in Molecular Biology and Genetics Department at METU. This is my second year in iGEM, hence I'm so excited and curious about all synthetic biology subjects and our project. I love swimming, sightseeing and doing science about genetics. Good luck to all teams that are in iGEM 2015 contest.
Uğurcan Sakızlı
Hello people! =^o t o^=  I’m Uğurcan SAKIZLI and they call me “ghu” which is my nickname on the internet. I am just graduated from Biology Department of METU and I was –fortunately- dragged into the iGEM team by İlkem again and again. So, this is my third iGEM experience. I still believe what I learn here will become useful in my future education and life. I like working in the wetlab but I’m mainly participating in the modeling team. Yarışmacı arkadaşlara başarılar diliyorum.
Melda Ercan
Hi! I'm Melda Ercan. I'm a third grade student from biology department. This year is my first year with METU_Turkey Team. Despite being new member in the team, I've already felt that iGEM is like a playground where  you can use their toys with your own creativity. I am mainly involved in the wetlab part of our team and also take a role in human practice part. I believe that this experience will make a great contribution to not only my knowledge but also my decision about the studying area of biology which I would like to be in.
Sinem Usluer
Hello I am Sinem Usluer. I’m third year student department of Molecular Biology and  Genetics at METU. This is my first year at iGEM. I hope that I will learn lots of things that are  very important for my future career. I'm so excited and curious about modelling and wetlab  and so I am very happy to be part of the iGEM. I love swimming, biking and reading articles  about genetic and diseases.
Doğa Bingöl
Hi everyone, my name is Doğa Bingöl. I am a senior student at biology departmant. I have participated in iGEM because I have decided to experience my theoritical knowledge in wetlab. Moreover, I want to make new friendships. Before iGEM I had participated in another lab which includes effects of stress on mice. This research is very enjoyable because I love spending time with animals. My hobbies are reading novels and writing some short stories. I also like hanging my friends. See you soon
Duygu Vonal
Hi everyone. I am Duygu VONAL, a third year student in Chemistry Education  department of METU. This is my first year in iGEM. I am so excited to be member of iGEM  team. I think participating in a project will help me to improve myself in terms of different ways.  Especially, wetlab part of this system caught my attention. Also , I believe that I can help my  friends in terms of supplying needed chemicals or synthesis of them. This team will improve  me both technical and interpersonal ways.
Helin Tercan
Hello folks! It’s Helin Tercan here. I’m a third year Molecular Biology and Genetics student. This is my second year at iGEM. For me iGEM means being with friends and having fun. Of course fun is not what iGEM is all about, it also requires lots of research and lab work. I take part in mostly wetlab. Besides iGEM and synthetic biology, I really enjoy reading science fiction and cooking for loved ones. That’s all for now :3
Gökberk Kaya
Hi everybody! It's Gökberk Kaya here. This is my second year in Biology department. That is my first year in iGEM team. I am looking forward to being a part of such a great organization. To have the opportunity to experience new stuff in Biology and to contribute to the teamwork led me to join iGEM team. My field of interest in Biology is Biochemistry and Neurology, I hope someday, I can contribute to these fields. Moreover, I like reading and exploring new habitats. Good luck to all teams which are in iGEM 2015 contest, see you soon.
Bengisu Molyer
Hello! I’m Bengisu Molyer. I am a second year molecular biology and genetics  student at METU. Ever since I was a kid I was really interested in biology so I am  really happy to be here. This is my first year in iGEM and I am really excited to be  a part of it. By working hard with my teammates, I know we will come up with  something amazing! I also enjoy reading, singing and playing the piano. I hope to  meet you all at the jamboree :)
Gökalp Yıldırır
Hey everyone! This is Gokalp, a second year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics in METU.  This is my first year at iGEM and I am interested in Modeling and WetLab and the Wiki.  Biology makes me perceive the world in an alternative way and I realize how  significant (but not as significant as we think) we human beings really are.  Besides iGEM, I like playing saxophone, cycling and reading. I LOVE traveling to  new countries. Hope to see you there, gorusuruz!
Yağmur Berfin Yazan
Hi there! I am a senior student in biology. I love to work in laboratory, I try to help people as much as I can and I care about environment. iGEM combines all, and that is why i joined iGEM. I take part in wetlab and human pracitce mainly. I am a performer in a theater named "Fareler Tiyatrosu". I am learning to play bridge. Also, I like to learn new languages. Good luck to all!
Öykü Ece Tosun
Hello humans! Öykü Ece Tosun is talking :) It is my first year in molecular biology and genetics department and also it is my very first year in iGEM, too. Being member of this kind of team is amazing. I always love working together and doing scientific things with team. Mostly these parts attracts me, but also MIT part should not be forgotten! :)) I will work in wetlab and modelling, I guess because I already know something about wetlab and I continue to learn about it during my education, but modelling is a different unexplored area for me and I'm very curious about it. Besides iGEM and science, I really enjoy painting. In fact, I intend to be an artist like Salvador Dali but without moustache :-}) I hope to see you in Boston!
Ekin Özsüle
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; My name is Ekin Özsüle. I'm a second year Biology student. This is my first year in iGEM. I always want to be a part of a lab and do some science even I was a little child. When I was a child I always read, do some little experiments like burning house, poking wasp nests, drowning in a lake, eating poisonous plants etc. And now I have a perfect opportunity to do something crazy. I love all things that are related with science. I also love history, science, literature, science, gaming, science, learning new things and science. Did I mention science?
Dilara İşbaşarır
Hello everyone. I’m Dilara İşbaşarır. I’m a third year biology student in METU. The idea of the being a part of a study  which aims to be beneficial for humans and environment really fascinates me and I think iGEM is one  of the best places as a start point to achieve this. Therefore, I joined to iGEM this year. The working  in such a team provides very different insights and makes easier to improve ourselves in many areas.  I take part in wetlab and Human Practice. In my spare time, I enjoy learning Japanese, reading belles- lettres and hanging with my friends. I wish good luck to all teams.
Çiğdem Yılmaz
Hi there! I am Çiğdem Yılmaz and I’m dealing with the experiments to get a PhD degree in METU, Biology Department. I've come a long way up here and I’m still making my way with an endless curiosity which is the reason why we all try to change the world for the better. As an assistant advisor of this iGEM team consisting of creative and smart students, I’m trying to do my best as far as possible.  Good luck to all iGEMers and don’t forget that: ‘’if there is a will, there is a way..’’
Melike Dönertaş
Hi! This is Melike, M.Sc. Biology student and iGEM Modelling Team advisor. This is fifth iGEM team that I'm involved in and as usual I had so much fun working with such a creative & open-minded team. I hope all iGEMers will always find something to improve/re-design in life. Best wishes!
Elif Özçelik
Hi guys! I am Elif Özcelik and I am a student at department of molecular biology and genetics. This is my third year in this department and first year in iGEM. I am happy to work for iGEM. When I was a little, daydreamer child, I thought a person who creates things, works in a laboratory and devotes whole life to science should live in a science fiction book, and this thought made me excited for such a life. Now, as a university student, I know this dream is not so far for me. Of course, this is not a science fiction book :) but iGEM provides me a huge step to living for science. Spending nights at laboratory, making researches during whole free times and repeat procedures again and again are hard sometimes for some of us, even for me. I neglected painting and fencing but still iGEM gives a giant pleasure to create some good things (like painting and I hope it will give a success and proud that a professional fencer feels through her veins). Thank you, iGEM to help me live in one of my childhood dream.
