Project Circuit
We modernized m-cherry (BBa_J06504) part to report the absence of the gluten protein in a solution or in a dough that our updated Kumamax enzyme is inactive in the environment. When the absence of the protein of the gluten our repoter gene is expressed and give red light to environment. Besides LacI promoter works under acidic environment in the dough formation.
Kill Switch Circuit
Strong promoter without thickener of LuxR and antiholin sequence: For our kill switch model first we design a circuit that secrete antiholin LuxR gene to supress the activity of holin and endolysin enzymes for working under normal conditions by digesting gluten into its small particles. After this composite part we design a new circuit that our composite gene part secrete a thickener(Xanthan Gum) that dough doesn't lose its stability and viscose structure type for consumers' choice.
Lux promoter activated by thickener(Xanthan Gum) gene part of LuxR and it start to lyse the cell with holin and endolysin activity.
