This year we decided to work on e-coli so that we going to follow a guaranteed way to make our necessary experiments and observations. This helps us to gain an improved safety. When we consider about future of this project, we primarily aim to overcome problems with gluten-free products such as variety and price. Beside of these problems, we also aim to supply people a practical way which can help them to make their own bread at their homes. If doing gluten-free bread will be easy then other products also will be easily available. These home make kits will be time saving for celiac disease people. As shown in the gluten intolerance survey results, most of the surveyed people support us about this idea. In reality, working on yeast will be an important step to improve less cost and time saving way to produce gluten-free products. Working with p GAPZ A vector generally produce greater yields than inducible expression.
