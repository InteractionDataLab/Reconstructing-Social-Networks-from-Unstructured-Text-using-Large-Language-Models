Characterization of K1392991
Here, we characterized the part K1392991 by ligasing K316003 and J23108. After centrifugation E. coli DH5a at 3000rpm for 3 minutes, we burst the cells and let the enzymes free in solution. Then, adding 1 mL of catechol(0.1M) into tube, color change into green.
At the following picture, there is Catechol (1,2-benzenediol) present in Left tube. It proves that in presence of catechol there is a degredation process in k316003+j23108.
There is no Catechol (1,2-benzenediol) present in Right tube. It proves that in absence of catechol there is no degredation of PET in k316003+j23108.
This characterization contains parts that Imperial_College_London created in year 2010, we have proved that it works well and we aproved its function with our own construct of its use.
At the following picture, the liquid is 0.1M catechol (1,2 benzenediol) itself:
According to gel image: Left, part is closed to 2300bp. Right, linearized backbone is closed to 4000bp.
K1392931 (Hydratase, 810bp)
We got those photos after PCR of E. coli BL21 (DE3). We have tried colony and liquid culture of E coli. BL21 (DE3)
K1392932 (Aldolase, 1014bp)
We got those photos after PCR of E. coli BL21 (DE3). We have tried colony and liquid culture of E coli. BL21 (DE3)
