Getting the DNA Parts from the Kit Plate: 1)Add 10 microliter of ddH2O into the wanted well. 2)Wait and get the part by pipetting. 3)Make sure to keep stock from these parts since there is so less of  them. 4)In case of having too less sample, you can dilute the stock 10:1  with ddH2O.     Midi Prep Plasmid Isolation Protocol: A)Bacterial culture, harvest, and lysis. 1)Pellet 25 ml (high copy)  or 100ml (low copy) overnight LB culture  at 6000xg for 15 min at +4˚C. 2)Homogeneously resuspend the bacterial pellet in 4 ml Buffer P1. 3)Add 4 ml Buffer P2, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4-6 times,  and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. 4)Add 4 ml Buffer P3, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4-6 times,  and incubate on ice for 15 min. B)Bacterial lysate clearing 5)Centrifuge at ≥20.000 xg for 30 min at +4 ˚C. Re-centrifuge the  supernatant at ≥20.000 xg for 15 min at +4 ˚C. C)Bind, wash, and elute plasmid DNA on QIAGEN-tip. 6)Equilibrate a QIAGEN-tip 100 by applying 4ml Buffer QBT and allow  column to empty by gravity flow. 7)Apply the supernatant(step 5) to the QIAGEN-tip and allow it to enter  the resin by gravity flow. 8)Wash the QIAGEN-tip with 2x10 ml Buffer QC. Allow Buffer QC to move  through the QIAGEN-tip by gravity flow. 9)Elute DNA with 5 ml Buffer QC into clean 2 ml, 15ml or 50ml vessel. D)Precipitate, wash, and redissolve plasmid DNA 10)Precipitate DNA by adding 3.5 ml room-temperature isopropanol to the  eluted DNA and mix. Centrifuge at ≥ 15.000 xg for 30 min at +4℃.  Carefully decant supernatant. 11) Wash DNA pelelt with 2ml room-temperature 70% ethanol and  centrifuge at  ≥ 15.000 xg for 10 min. Carefully decant supernatant. 12) Air-dry pellet for 5-10 min and redissolve DNA in a suitable volume  of buffer.     Plasmid Isolation Protocol: Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250μL of the Resuspension Solution.  Transfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria  should be resuspended  completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps  remain. Add  250μL of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the  tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Add 250μL of the Lysis Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly  by inverting the tube 4-6 times. Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA. Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by  decanting or pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white  precipitate. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place column  back into the same collection tube. Add 500μL of the Wash Solution to the GeneJET spin column.  Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through. Place  the column back into the same collection tube. Repeat the wash procedure using 500μL of the Wash Solution. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to  remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual  ethanol in plasmid preps.Transfer the GneJET spin column into a fresh  1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 50μL of the Elution Buffer to the  center of GeneJET spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA.  Take care not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. Incubate  for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 2 min. Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20 ˚C.     80% Glycerol Preparation: Add 80ml 99.7% glycerol to 20ml demineralized water Autoclave
