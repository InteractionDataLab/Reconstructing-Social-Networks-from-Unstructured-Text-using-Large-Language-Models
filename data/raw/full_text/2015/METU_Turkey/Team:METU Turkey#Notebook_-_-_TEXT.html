COLLABORATION WITH PASTEUR
Serdar is a nice boy. It was easy to communicate and speak with him. Ilkem was again full of care for both of the teams like he always is O Sharing ideas and problems with another team made us more comfortable. The competition can make students stressful!!  In addition, one of the advisor instructors of Pasteur team joined us and he made us laugh with his funny personality.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY BENGISU!
After an exhausting meeting, we got together and arranged a little surprise for Bengisu! It is nice to share both happiness and responsibilities!
Throughout the year,
Lab Work
Team members lose themselves when they are working. Sometimes we cannot bring them back ! We all love bacteria. Ilkem sure is extra careful about the lab safety rules! O Good job İlkem!
Brainstorming
They look bored right? Maybe it looks like that but actually they are thinking. The team gets together and decides on important points so that our project can move forward.
Lab Materials
These materials have become our friends during our lab sessions. We treat our plates as if they are our children. They never betray us. Love your lab materials! O
Training
Experiments need attention. Experienced members of the METU iGEM team teach the necessary lab skills to new members. This way, METU iGEM team improves.
Meetings
We had a lot of meetings during the year. These are just a few of them. Some of them were stressful, some of them hopeful. Sometimes we had serious problems. However, thanks to our determined personalities we overcame all of these problems. In addition, we cannot ignore the contributions of our advisor instructor Mr. Son who have always helped us remain hopeful and lit us the way when we thought we cannot possibly move forward.
