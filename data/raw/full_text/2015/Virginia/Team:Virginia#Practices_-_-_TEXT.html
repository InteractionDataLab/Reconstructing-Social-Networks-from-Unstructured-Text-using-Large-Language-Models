Part I: Education Pamphlet
The educational pamphlet we prepared for the human practices portion of our project is intended to   educate readers about diabetes, its symptoms and treatments, and how our solution would fit into a   diabeticâ€™s lifestyle.  This pamphlet, displayed below, would be a beneficial tool for both users of our   product and individuals interested in diabetes.

Part II: Synthetic Biology Documentary
With so many moving parts in our synthetic biology investigation, a documentary seemed like an ideal   choice to showcase what we have been doing over the summer and how this research will translate into   an effect mechanism of change in the surrounding scientific community.  Our documentary consists of   several components, including (but not limited to) explaining diabetes, the types of diabetes, and the   prevalence of diabetes in the US and globally; explaining the premises of synthetic biology, the iGEM   Jamboree and spirit of competition, and our project; seeking advice of tenured professors to evaluate   the legitimacy and validity of our research and its ability to partially combat diabetes; and investigating   the process, primarily dictated by the FDA, of how to approve a product to be marketed to the public.    This documentary saw the consultations of several highly regarded professors including Dr. Susanna   Keller, Dr. Keith Kozminski, Dr. Anthony McCall, and Dr. Gil Siegel on various topics as stated previously.    Furthermore, Dr. Owen Fields of the Pfizer pharmaceutical company and Dr. John Herr provided us with   commentary on the processes behind traversing through FDA approval to market our probiotic to the   diabetic and pre-diabetic public.  We concluded the documentary with a brief, yet nonetheless accurate   survey of FDA regulations of our would-be product/probiotic as well as any labeling and fast-tracking   categories our product could fall under.

Part III: Software
Once the assays have been performed to determine the levels at which Levan and glycogen are formed   in the gut, we deemed it novel and necessary to develop an online/mobile application for individuals   that may take our probiotic.  Several diet applications exist for both Android and iOS and this application   would be the final step in our product interfacing with the client (the first step being the pamphlet   educating the client about diabetes and various health benefits our product can provide and the second   being the documentary that showcases the process of getting the product approved by the FDA as well   as several consultations with pharmaceutical companies and tenured professors as to the merits and   legitimacy of our product).  The application would be a rudimentary one that would require caloric input   by the user and, by virtue of an algorithm derived from the results of the assays, a quantity of the   product needed to be consumed to neutralize a postprandial glycemic spike would be displayed on the   mobile screen.
