IPTG Promoter+RBS+EIIA+TT
BBa_K1600001
IPTG Promoter+RBS+EIIA+TT
BioBrick BBa_1600001 serves to increase the uptake of glucose by the cell. This extra glucose will then be   polymerized by one of our following BioBrick devices (BBa_K1600002) . This composite BioBrick is composed   of BBa_K215000 (IPTG-inducible promoter plus RBS), and BBa_K1508003 (EIIA plus terminator).

BBa_K1600002
Promoter+RBS+GlgC+RBS+SacB+TT
BioBrick BBa_1600002 is our composite polymerization circuit. This BioBrick polymerizes glucose into glycogen, polymerizes levan from fructose,   and possesses the kill switch responsible for lysing the cell. This composite BioBrick is composed of   BBa_J23110 (promoter), BBa_K118018 (RBS and Glgc), BBa_K322921 (RBS and SacB) and BBa_B0015   (double terminator).
EIIBC
BBa_K1600000
EIIBC
BioBrick BBa_K1600000 also serves to increase the uptake of glucose by the cell, helping EIIA. EIIBC is   the actual channel so this BioBrick would upregulate the uptake of glucose. The only part on this   BioBrick is EIIBC which we extracted from the genome via PCR.
