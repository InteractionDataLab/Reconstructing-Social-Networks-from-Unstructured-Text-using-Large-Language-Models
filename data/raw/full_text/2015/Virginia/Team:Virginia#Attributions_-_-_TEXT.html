Advisors
Keith Kozminski, Ph.D.
Associate Professor of Biology, University of Virginia
Dr. Keith Kozminski has been an integral part of the iGEM program at the University of Virginia since   2008.  With over 25 years of experience in the field of molecular and cell biology, Dr. Kozminski was an   invaluable resource to the team.  Dr. Kozminski received his PhD in 1995 from Yale University and   completed Postdoctoral Research at the University of California at Berkeley until 2001.  In 2002 Dr.   Kozminski joined the faculty of the Department of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences and the   Department of Cell Biology at the School of Medicine.  Dr. Kozminski’s research focuses on the   molecular mechanisms that regulate asymmetric or polarized cell growth.  Outside of education and   research at the University of Virginia, Dr. Kozminski is an editor of Molecular Biology of the Cell and the   journal of the American Society for Cell Biology. Additionally, Dr. Kozminski works for the National   Science Foundation as a scientific review panelist.  As advisor to our team, Dr. Kozminski was a fantastic   source of guidance and inspiration.  We are incredibly grateful to him for all of his aid over the course of   our research.
Jason Papin, Ph.D.
Professor of Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia
Dr. Jason Papin is a professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia, and he serves as one of the University of Virginia iGEM team’s advisors. Dr. Papin received his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2004. Dr. Papin’s research interests focus on modeling of biochemical networks and their role in disease states. Dr. Papin is an invaluable resource when it comes to learning about computational modelling and always lends his help to the team when we are in need.
Matthew Tucker
Matthew Tucker serves as one of the University of Virginia iGEM team’s advisors. Matt is a two-time iGEM veteran, participating in U.Va.’s 2013 and 2014 projects. He is a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, with a degree in Chemical Engineering with a concentration in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering. Matt always lends himself to helping the team in any way he can, and he is an invaluable resource to the iGEM team.  Without his constant aid and technical advice, we would probably still be at the starting block, and for this we offer Matt a very special thank you.
Other Supporters
Kay Christopher
Upper Level Labs Preparator, University of Virginia
Kay Christopher has been a huge supporter of many iGEM teams over the years, and graciously provides the team with her lab space, her materials, and most importantly, her invaluable knowledge. The 2015 iGEM team thanks Ms. Christopher immensely for her support.
Frederick Epstein, Ph.D.
Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering, Professor of Radiology, U.Va.
Professor Fred Epstein has been a supporter of a few iGEM teams, and through the funding of the U.Va. Biomedical Engineering Department, Dr. Epstein has generously provided financially for U.Va. iGEM over the years. We are very thankful to Dr. Epstein for his ongoing support of U.Va. iGEM.
George Cahen, Ph.D.
Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, U.Va & Associate Vice President, Virginia Engineering Foundation
Professor George Cahen is a long-time supporter of U.Va. iGEM, and he has graciously supported iGEM financially through the Lacy Alumni Engineering fund, but even more importantly Dr. Cahen has remained a contact point and resource for many iGEM teams, and we are very thankful for his ongoing support.
Susanna Keller, M.D.
Dr. Susanna Keller is a distinguished MD/Ph.D member of the University of Virginia research facility   located in Fontaine Research Park.  Her research interests include insulin signaling, metabolism, and   intracellular insulin trafficking across membranes, which fortunately complement our VGEM project this   year.  Dr. Keller has been instrumental in giving us feedback on the scientific merits of our project and   providing us with opportunities for Policy and Practices.  She will be a key interviewee of the   Documentary/Podcast segment of our Policy and Practices component where she provides very   informative and pragmatic feedback and data about diabetes and our project in general.
Office of the Vice President for Research
U.Va. iGEM is especially grateful to the fine faculty with the Office of the Vice President for Research, who, once again, has been the largest financer of U.Va. iGEM. We could not do anything that we do without their very generous donations, and we are thankful for their continued support.
