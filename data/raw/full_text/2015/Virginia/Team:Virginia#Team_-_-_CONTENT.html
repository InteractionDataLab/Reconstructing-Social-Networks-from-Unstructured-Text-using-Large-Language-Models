Supraja can’t quite make up her mind about what she’s studying, but we know it’ll be something that’s fairly science-heavy. A dedicated member of iGEM 2015’s so-called BioSquad, she can be seen in the lab at ungodly hours of the night screaming something about failed competent cells.</P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-dominic"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Dominic Ritchey</H3><H5>Wiki Programmer and Co-Chief Financial Officer</H5><H4>Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Computer Science &amp; Biology</H4><P> Dominic Ritchey is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia from Columbus, Ohio. Dominic is studying Computer Science and Biology because he has no idea yet what he wants to do with his life. Dominic is the Chief Financial Officer and Wiki Programmer for the team, so he has not even touched a pipette in the lab as of yet. Dominic is a dedicated member of the so-called Ca$hCrew, and he can often be found camped-out in a U.Va. library coding for hours on end.  </P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-jingyuan"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Jingyuan Zhang</H3><H5>Laboratory Technician &amp; Biological Research Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2017 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering</H4><P>Jingyuan Zhang is a rising third-year at the University of Virginia from Beijing, China, and she studies Biomedical Engineering. Jingyuan is a dedicated member of the BioSquad, and officially she is one of the team laboratory technicians. Jingyuan can frequently be found running hastily around the lab with multiple timers going off. </P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-liam"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Liam Wolf</H3><H5>Administrator, Co-Chief Financial Officer and Policy &amp; Practices Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Systems Engineering</H4><P>Liam Wolf is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Liam is studying Systems Engineering, even though no one really knows what that is. Liam is involved in just about everything the team does, whether he is asked or not, and the team lovingly (and mostly jokingly) refers to him as the Overlord. Officially, Liam is the team Administrator, though he is also involved in every other part of the project. Liam claims that, one day, all 9 team members will get together for a team-building activity, but no one really believes it. </P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-rena"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Rena Yuan</H3><H5>Policy &amp; Practices and Biology Research Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2018 - College of Arts and Sciences, Biology and Statistics</H4><P> Rena Yuan is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia studying biology and statistics. Rena is originally from Long Island, New York, but is now a NOVA (Northern Virginia) transplant. Rena is a dedicated member of the so-called BioSquad and though she works full-time in another position, she can frequently be seen coming into the lab at 4:00 am in order to get some of her work done, even when she knows that she’s not expected to do so.</P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-issac"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Issac Li</H3><H5>Head of Modelling, Policy &amp; Practices Team Member and Biology Research Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2016 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering</H4><P> Issac Li is a rising fourth-year at the University of Virginia studying Biomedical Engineering from Shijiazhuang, China. Issac is the official Head of Modeling for the 2015 team. Issac is a de facto addition to the BioSquad and also aids in Policy and Practices. </P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-sean"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Sean Sequeira</H3><H5>Modelling Team Member, Policy and Practices Team Member, and Finance Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering</H4><P>Sean Sequeira is a rising second-year studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia from Glen Allen, VA.  He is a valued member of the Financial Team, the Modelling team, and the Policy and Practices team.   Sean can frequently be found working on probiotic research, figuring out sources for funding, or thinking of ways to make the Policy and Practices documentary Oscar worthy.</P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-shiran"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Shiran Su</H3><H5>Laboratory Technician and Biological Research Team Member</H5><H4>Class of 2016 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering</H4><P>Shiran Su is a rising fourth-year at the University of Virginia from Nanjing, China. Shiran is finishing up her degree in Biomedical Engineering this year. Shiran is a dedicated member of the so-called BioSquad. Without fail, one can either find Shiran somewhere in the building taking a quick daytime nap on a bench or lecturing another engineering teammate about the ease of the U.Va. engineering curriculum, especially after s/he has been complaining about a difficult class.</P></DIV></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="popup inactive" id="popup-connor"><DIV class="text-wrap"><P>(click to close)</P><H3>Connor Jahelka</H3><H5>Head of Policy &amp; Practices</H5><H4>Class of 2017 - College of Arts and Sciences, Biology </H4><P> Connor Jahelka is a rising third-year at the University of Virginia from Fairfax, Virginia. Connor is studying biology and splits his time between a neuroscience lab and iGEM during the summer. Connor is the Head of Policy and Practices for this year’s team.  Connor has a notoriously faulty alarm clock, on which he blames his persistent lateness, and he works most effectively when given very detailed, itemized to-do lists and constant negative reinforcement, mostly provided by Liam.</P></DIV></DIV></A><DIV class="wrapper1"><DIV class="team_profile_link"><A href="https://igem.org/Team.cgi"><DIV><P>Official iGEM Team Profile</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="team_profile_link"><A href="http://seas.virginia.edu/students/igem/"><DIV><P>Official U.Va. iGEM Website</P></DIV></A></DIV></DIV><H1>University of Virginia 2015 iGEM Team Members</H1><P id="parenth">(click an image to learn more about any team member)</P><DIV id="team-info"><DIV class="container"><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="supraja-box"><P>Supraja Chittari</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="dominic-box"><P>Dominic Ritchey</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="jingyuan-box"><P>Jingyuan Zhang</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="liam-box"><P>Liam Wolf</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="rena-box"><P>Rena Yuan</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="issac-box"><P>Issac Li</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="sean-box"><P>Sean Sequeira</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="shiran-box"><P>Shiran Su</P></DIV></A><A href="javascript:void(0);"><DIV class="team-box" id="connor-box"><P>Connor Jahelka</P></DIV></A></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV id="foot-text"><P>University of Virginia iGEM</P><P>148 Gilmer Hall</P><P>485 McCormick Road</P><P>Charlottesville, Virginia 22904</P><P>United States of America</P><P><A href="mailto:virginia.igem@gmail.com">
