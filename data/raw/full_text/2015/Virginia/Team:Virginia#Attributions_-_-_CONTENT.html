2008.  With over 25 years of experience in the field of molecular and cell biology, Dr. Kozminski was an 

invaluable resource to the team.  Dr. Kozminski received his PhD in 1995 from Yale University and 

completed Postdoctoral Research at the University of California at Berkeley until 2001.  In 2002 Dr. 

Kozminski joined the faculty of the Department of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences and the 

Department of Cell Biology at the School of Medicine.  Dr. Kozminski’s research focuses on the 

molecular mechanisms that regulate asymmetric or polarized cell growth.  Outside of education and 

research at the University of Virginia, Dr. Kozminski is an editor of Molecular Biology of the Cell and the 

journal of the American Society for Cell Biology. Additionally, Dr. Kozminski works for the National 

Science Foundation as a scientific review panelist.  As advisor to our team, Dr. Kozminski was a fantastic 

source of guidance and inspiration.  We are incredibly grateful to him for all of his aid over the course of 

our research.

Dr. Papin received his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2004. Dr. Papin’s research interests focus on modeling of biochemical networks and their role in disease states. Dr. Papin is an invaluable resource when it comes to learning about computational modelling and always lends his help to the team when we are in need. </P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="3"><H3>Matthew Tucker</H3><P> Matthew Tucker serves as one of the University of Virginia iGEM team’s advisors. Matt is a two-time iGEM veteran, participating in U.Va.’s 2013 and 2014 projects. He is a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, with a degree in Chemical Engineering with a concentration in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering. Matt always lends himself to helping the team in any way he can, and he is an invaluable resource to the iGEM team.  Without his constant aid and technical advice, we would probably still be at the starting block, and for this we offer Matt a very special thank you.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="4" style="background:#007bb6;"><H2>Other Supporters</H2></TD></TR><TR><TD class="small-td"><H3>Kay Christopher</H3><H4>Upper Level Labs Preparator, University of Virginia</H4><P>Kay Christopher has been a huge supporter of many iGEM teams over the years, and graciously provides the team with her lab space, her materials, and most importantly, her invaluable knowledge.

intracellular insulin trafficking across membranes, which fortunately complement our VGEM project this 

year.  Dr. Keller has been instrumental in giving us feedback on the scientific merits of our project and 

providing us with opportunities for Policy and Practices.  She will be a key interviewee of the 

Documentary/Podcast segment of our Policy and Practices component where she provides very 

informative and pragmatic feedback and data about diabetes and our project in general.
