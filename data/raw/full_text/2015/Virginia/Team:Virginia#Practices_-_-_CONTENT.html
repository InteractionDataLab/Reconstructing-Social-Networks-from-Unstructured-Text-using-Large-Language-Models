educate readers about diabetes, its symptoms and treatments, and how our solution would fit into a 

diabeticâ€™s lifestyle.  This pamphlet, displayed below, would be a beneficial tool for both users of our 

product and individuals interested in diabetes.

choice to showcase what we have been doing over the summer and how this research will translate into 

an effect mechanism of change in the surrounding scientific community.  Our documentary consists of 

several components, including (but not limited to) explaining diabetes, the types of diabetes, and the 

prevalence of diabetes in the US and globally; explaining the premises of synthetic biology, the iGEM 

Jamboree and spirit of competition, and our project; seeking advice of tenured professors to evaluate 

the legitimacy and validity of our research and its ability to partially combat diabetes; and investigating 

the process, primarily dictated by the FDA, of how to approve a product to be marketed to the public.  

This documentary saw the consultations of several highly regarded professors including Dr. Susanna 

Keller, Dr. Keith Kozminski, Dr. Anthony McCall, and Dr. Gil Siegel on various topics as stated previously.  

Furthermore, Dr. Owen Fields of the Pfizer pharmaceutical company and Dr. John Herr provided us with 

commentary on the processes behind traversing through FDA approval to market our probiotic to the 

diabetic and pre-diabetic public.  We concluded the documentary with a brief, yet nonetheless accurate 

survey of FDA regulations of our would-be product/probiotic as well as any labeling and fast-tracking 

categories our product could fall under.

in the gut, we deemed it novel and necessary to develop an online/mobile application for individuals 

that may take our probiotic.  Several diet applications exist for both Android and iOS and this application 

would be the final step in our product interfacing with the client (the first step being the pamphlet 

educating the client about diabetes and various health benefits our product can provide and the second 

being the documentary that showcases the process of getting the product approved by the FDA as well 

as several consultations with pharmaceutical companies and tenured professors as to the merits and 

legitimacy of our product).  The application would be a rudimentary one that would require caloric input 

by the user and, by virtue of an algorithm derived from the results of the assays, a quantity of the 

product needed to be consumed to neutralize a postprandial glycemic spike would be displayed on the 

mobile screen.
