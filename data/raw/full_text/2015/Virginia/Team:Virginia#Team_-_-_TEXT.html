Supraja Chittari
Poster and Presentation Coordinator & Biological Research Team Member
Class of 2018 - College of Arts & Sciences, Undeclared
Supraja Chittari is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia from Vienna, Virginia. Supraja can’t quite make up her mind about what she’s studying, but we know it’ll be something that’s fairly science-heavy. A dedicated member of iGEM 2015’s so-called BioSquad, she can be seen in the lab at ungodly hours of the night screaming something about failed competent cells.

Dominic Ritchey
Wiki Programmer and Co-Chief Financial Officer
Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Computer Science & Biology
Dominic Ritchey is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia from Columbus, Ohio. Dominic is studying Computer Science and Biology because he has no idea yet what he wants to do with his life. Dominic is the Chief Financial Officer and Wiki Programmer for the team, so he has not even touched a pipette in the lab as of yet. Dominic is a dedicated member of the so-called Ca$hCrew, and he can often be found camped-out in a U.Va. library coding for hours on end.

Jingyuan Zhang
Laboratory Technician & Biological Research Team Member
Class of 2017 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering
Jingyuan Zhang is a rising third-year at the University of Virginia from Beijing, China, and she studies Biomedical Engineering. Jingyuan is a dedicated member of the BioSquad, and officially she is one of the team laboratory technicians. Jingyuan can frequently be found running hastily around the lab with multiple timers going off.

Liam Wolf
Administrator, Co-Chief Financial Officer and Policy & Practices Team Member
Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Systems Engineering
Liam Wolf is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Liam is studying Systems Engineering, even though no one really knows what that is. Liam is involved in just about everything the team does, whether he is asked or not, and the team lovingly (and mostly jokingly) refers to him as the Overlord. Officially, Liam is the team Administrator, though he is also involved in every other part of the project. Liam claims that, one day, all 9 team members will get together for a team-building activity, but no one really believes it.

Rena Yuan
Policy & Practices and Biology Research Team Member
Class of 2018 - College of Arts and Sciences, Biology and Statistics
Rena Yuan is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia studying biology and statistics. Rena is originally from Long Island, New York, but is now a NOVA (Northern Virginia) transplant. Rena is a dedicated member of the so-called BioSquad and though she works full-time in another position, she can frequently be seen coming into the lab at 4:00 am in order to get some of her work done, even when she knows that she’s not expected to do so.

Issac Li
Head of Modelling, Policy & Practices Team Member and Biology Research Team Member
Class of 2016 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering
Issac Li is a rising fourth-year at the University of Virginia studying Biomedical Engineering from Shijiazhuang, China. Issac is the official Head of Modeling for the 2015 team. Issac is a de facto addition to the BioSquad and also aids in Policy and Practices.

Sean Sequeira
Modelling Team Member, Policy and Practices Team Member, and Finance Team Member
Class of 2018 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering
Sean Sequeira is a rising second-year studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia from Glen Allen, VA.  He is a valued member of the Financial Team, the Modelling team, and the Policy and Practices team.   Sean can frequently be found working on probiotic research, figuring out sources for funding, or thinking of ways to make the Policy and Practices documentary Oscar worthy.

Shiran Su
Laboratory Technician and Biological Research Team Member
Class of 2016 - School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Biomedical Engineering
Shiran Su is a rising fourth-year at the University of Virginia from Nanjing, China. Shiran is finishing up her degree in Biomedical Engineering this year. Shiran is a dedicated member of the so-called BioSquad. Without fail, one can either find Shiran somewhere in the building taking a quick daytime nap on a bench or lecturing another engineering teammate about the ease of the U.Va. engineering curriculum, especially after s/he has been complaining about a difficult class.

Connor Jahelka
Head of Policy & Practices
Class of 2017 - College of Arts and Sciences, Biology
Connor Jahelka is a rising third-year at the University of Virginia from Fairfax, Virginia. Connor is studying biology and splits his time between a neuroscience lab and iGEM during the summer. Connor is the Head of Policy and Practices for this year’s team.  Connor has a notoriously faulty alarm clock, on which he blames his persistent lateness, and he works most effectively when given very detailed, itemized to-do lists and constant negative reinforcement, mostly provided by Liam.
