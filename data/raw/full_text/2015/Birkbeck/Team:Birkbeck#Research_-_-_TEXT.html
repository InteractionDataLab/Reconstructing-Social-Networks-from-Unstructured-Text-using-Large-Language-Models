Videos from Dr. Kahn (a vet on the front line in Pakistan) & Dr. Bhakta (Head of ISMB Mycobacteria Research Laboratory at Birkbeck) set the seen for the requirement of rapid diagnostic systems. A discussion on how our product could be applied. This section finishes with a discussion on neglected diseases with a particular focus on Tuberculosis global distribution.
This section contains detailed information on experimental procedures which was carried out.
The measurements section of this site contains all the data generate (from the interlab study to our biobricks). Detailed statistical analysis with the results discussed in detail.
The modelling section lays out our methodology & the way in which we expect our systems to behave.
The results section contains the raw data obtained from our cloning experiments. Here we demonstrate the insertion of synthesised Gblocks into vectors by restriction diagnostics.
The results of our data and analysis are briefly summarosed in this section.
An overview of safety precautions carried out. Our COSHH risk assesments & Lab induction safety details are in this section
