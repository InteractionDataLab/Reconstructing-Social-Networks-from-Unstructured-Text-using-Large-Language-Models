Creating electrocompetent cells
Making of competent cells
Step 1 - Overnight Culture Preparation
1. Transfer 10 mL of sterile LB to a 50 mL Falcon Tube.
2. Inoculate media with a single colony of E. coli cells.
3. Incubate overnight at 37°C, in a shaker at 230 rpm.
Step 2 - Preparing Electrocompetent E. coli Cells for Storage.
1. Add 150-200 mL of LB media to the autoclaved 2 L conical (NB/ culture volume must be 1/10 of the total flask volume).
2. Use a 0.5% inoculum from step 1.
3. Incubate at 30°C until OD600 ~0.6 (approximately 4 hours).
4. When culture reaches OD600 = 0.6, cool to 4°C
Step 3 (after culture OD600 ~ 0.6 has been achieved)
1. Aliquot 50 mL of culture into Falcon tubes. Incubate on ice
2. Pre-cool centrifuge to 4°C
3. Centrifuge the tubes for 10 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm.
4. Decant supernatant.
5. Wash 1: resuspend pellet in 10 mL of 1 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7). Incubate on ice for 5 mins. Gently disturb tube every 30 seconds to facilitate resuspension of the pellet.
6. Centrifuge for 10 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm
7. Decant supernatant & resuspend pellet in 10 mL of 1 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7). Incubate on ice for 5 minutes. Gently disturb tube every 30 seconds to facilitate resuspension of the pellet.
8. Add two of the Falcon tubes together when cells are fully resuspended (giving two 20 mL cell suspensions). Top each cell suspension up to 50 mL with 1 mM Hepes (pH 7).
9. centrifuge again for 10 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm.
10. Decant the supernatant & resuspend the pellet in 10 mL Hepes (pH 7). Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
11. centrifuge again for 10 mins at 4°C at 4000 rpm.
12. Decant the supernatant & resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of Hepes (pH 7). Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
13. Add glycerol to a final concentration of 12.5% (vol/vol). Mix thoroughly (but GENTLY) & incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
14. Aliquot 50 µL of cells suspension into 500 µL tubes and store at -80oC.
