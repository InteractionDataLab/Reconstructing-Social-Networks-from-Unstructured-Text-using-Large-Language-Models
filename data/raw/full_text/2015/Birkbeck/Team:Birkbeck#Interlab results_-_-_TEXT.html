Fig. 1: Growth Curve of E. coli DH5α Strains Following Culture Optical Density of 600 nm.
Growth kinetics was initially studied using 50 mL cultures. Fig. 1 shows the growth kinetics of E. coli DH5α & derivative strains containing plasmids from the InterLab study.  The growth curve shows that the E. coli strain that contains the P1-gfp expression device grows at a slower rate than the other strains investigated. At 220 minutes the E. coli DH5α P1 strain has a significantly lower OD600 than the E. coli DH5α (P=0.023). E. coli DH5α remains significantly higher in OD600 than E. coli DH5α with the P1-gfp expression device (P=<0.001). The only difference between the E. coli DH5α & E. coli DH5α positive control device is observed at 280 minutes into the growth curve (P=0.016) where the positive control has a higher OD600. The multiple comparison table showing P values can be viewed in Table S1.

Fig. 2: Growth Curve of E. coli DH5α Strains Following Culture Optical Density of 395 nm.
In order to investigate if there could be a point in the E. coli DH5α growth curve in which a signal from the GFP could be detected by absorbance, the growth curves were also conducted using the major absorption peak of GFP (wavelength 395 nm). The growth curve data for the culture optical density is displayed in Fig. 2.
When comparing the data point of E. coli DH5α strains, there appears to be a significant increase in culture OD395 in the E. coli cells with the P1-gfp expression device (P<0.001). This apparent signal is only present between 60-100 minutes of growth. When comparing the positive control & E. coli DH5α1, there is no significant difference between the data sets at 60 or 100 minutes (P=1 for both time points). A small potential signal is observed from the oositive control gfp expression device at 280 minutes (P=0.012) & 300 minutes (P=0.006). This significance is lost after 300 minutes (P=0.262). See Table S2 for more details. In order to verify these results & to test for the feasibility of scaling down to a 96-well microtitre plate assay, a 10 hour growth curve was conducted in a 96-well microtitre plate (see Fig. 6-8).
Fig. 3: Viable Count of E. coli DH5α After 60 mins.
In order to assess how many viable cells correspond to different optical densities, a viable count was conducted on E. coli DH5α1 at 60 minutes (Fig. 3 & Table 1), 175 minutes (Fig. 5 & Table 2) & 225 minutes (data not shown due to high level of contamination).
Considering the OD600 of the E. coli DH5α1 cultures at 60 mins, triplicate cultures were OD600 = 0.029, 0.01 & 0.025. The viable count of each of the cultures gave a mean of 2.57×106 cfu/mL (Table 1). It can therefore be concluded that an E. coli DH5α culture at an OD600 = 0.021 corresponds to approximately 2.57×106 cfu/mL.

Fig. 4: Viable Count of E. coli DH5α After 175 mins.
At 175 minutes into growth, the E. coli DH5α1 cultures had OD600of; 0.255, 0.216 & 0.262. The viable count of each of the cultures gave a mean of 1.33×108 cfu/mL (Table 2). It can therefore be concluded that an E. coli DH5α culture at an OD600 = 0.244 corresponds to approximately 1.33×108 cfu/mL. Considering the previous OD600 (0.021), there is approximately a 10-fold increase in OD600 which corresponds to nearly a 100-fold increase in viable cells.

Comparing the positive control gfp expression device with E. coli DH5α, at no point in the growth curve does the fluorescence of the positive control gfp expression device increase above that of the E. coli DH5α culture. Even at 580 minutes of culturing the positive control does not increase in fluorescence above the E. coli E. coli DH5α (P=0.677).
Comparing the P2-gfp expression device with E. coli DH5α, Initially there is no significant difference between the two cultures in fluorescence (P=1). There is a highly significant Increase in fluorescence from P2 at 180 minutes (P=0.007).
