Preparing chemically competent cells
Making chemically competent cells
1. Grow 5 mL overnight culture in LB broth.
2. Sub-culture (1% inoculum) in 25 mL of LB.
3. Grow until OD600 = 0.3-0.5 (DH5a, this is around 2 hours).
4. Put on ice for 20 mins (can be longer, not an essential step).
5. Spin cells down at 4oC at 4,500 rpm for 20 mins.
6. Resuspend in 2.5 mL of ice cold TSB.
7. Leave on ice for at least 10 mins.
8. Snap freeze in 50 uL aliquots to -80oC or use immediately.
