Ariana "the Explora" Mirzarafie-Ahi
BSc Biological Sciences Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Ariana was offered a place at Birkbeck in 2011. At this time, higher education reforms took over with tuition fees tripling and the removal of part-time education grants. She feels privileged to have gone to such a distinctive institute at the heart of London and owes her great academic experience to Birkbeck.
Ariana graduated this year from Birkbeck, University of London with a BSc in Biological Sciences. Her final year project was on investigating protein nano cages, and throughout the years had research internships on protein crystallography, tissue engineering and bioinformatics. After iGEM Ariana is starting a PhD in Interdisciplinary Biosciences at UCL.

Elliott Parris
MSci Natural Sciences Graduate, University College London
Elliott is a 2015 University College London MSci Natural Sciences Graduate, where his major was Genetics, Evolution & Environment and his minor was Synthetic Organic Chemistry.       iGEM offered a unique opportunity for him to bridge his degree disciplines with invaluable synthetic biology experience; the field in which he wishes to acquire a doctorate position.
The first in his family to go to University, he feels privileged to be a part of the first Birkbeck team and all that it represents – determination, perseverance, progression and success.      Besides his desire to implement synthetic biology on healthcare, one long-term goal of his is to engineer organisms that can reverse drivers positively feeding back into climate change.       A football fanatic and player alike - he eats like a pig, drinks like a fish and cycles with animosity.

Sean Ross Craig
BSc Microbiology Graduate, University of Dundee; MRes Microbiology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
A University of Dundee BSc Microbiology 2012 Graduate, he worked as a chef for a year and a half after graduation. Birkbeck, University of London gave Sean the opportunity to study the subject that he loves and work at the same time. He was able to complete his MRes due to the flexibility of Birkbeck. Without an institution such as Birkbeck offering the flexibility in study, he would not have been able to obtain a research based post-graduate qualification.  Being a part of the iGEM team means a lot to Sean & he hopes to give back to the great institute that provided him with the opportunity to pursue a career in academic science.
When Sean is not looking at Biosynthetic pathways or dreaming up scientific ideas for the good of mankind sean enjoys playing & watching football. He also has a keen interest in nature. He has the pace to keep up with Elliott on the eating front (but doesn’t have the stamina to eat the sheer volume) however, does have the stamina on the drinking front.

Dr. Vitor Pinheiro
Lecturer, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London
Originally from Brazil, Vitor went to northern Scotland for a gap year and fell in love with the weather. As the second best student in Economics in his year (in a class of two), he decided early that Mathematics was a far better investment – ditching Economics in favour of Further Mathematics. He joined University of Cambridge to do Physics, heard the calling of Chemistry but due to a poor choice of modules in the Natural Sciences Tripos, ended up a biochemist (BA, MSci and the freebie MA).
He stayed in Cambridge for a PhD in bacterial pathogenesis and for his post-doctoral career in synthetic biology. In his steady march South, he joined UCL and Birkbeck as Lecturer in Synthetic Biology in 2013.

Yan-Kay Ho
BBSRC LiDO PhD student
MSc Natural Sciences Graduate, University College London
Yan-Kay has always had a keen interest in science: from genetics and evolution, to developmental biology, and animal behaviour. She's even dabbled a bit into palaeontology, ecology, and systems biology. Now, through the BBSRC London Interdisciplinary Biosciences PhD LiDO Consortium programme, she is seguing* into the exciting field of synthetic biology. That is, having first taken this turn in the road via iGEM on the UCL Team 2014. Of course, the road continues further, and this is why she finds herself advising a new cohort of iGEM students, both on the Birkbeck (and UCL) 2015 Teams.

Part-time Team Members
Birkbeck as an institution prides itself on being accessible to all, and so Birkbeck's iGEM team made sure it was also. We had team members dedicated to the project from the outset but, because of working full-time and other commitments extending through the entirety of the project, could only commit a limited amount of time. They therefore used their expertise to aid particular aspects of the project when possible. Their roles in the project are also outlined below.
Wayne Pires - Birkbeck iGEM Team Founder
BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Mervyn Richardson - Outreach Participant
2nd Year BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London
For the last 9 years, Mervyn has been working in the logistics industry at DHL Express. He has always been fascinated by genetics and finds the intricacies of the bio-molecular world intellectually stimulating. Now, Mervyn hopes to embark on a new and rewarding career in the biosciences.
Mervyn is currently working at DHL and studying towards a BSc in chemical & molecular biology at Birkbeck University of London. He feels privileged to be in the first iGEM team to represent Birkbeck and is committed to setting a high standard paving the way for successive teams in the future. Mervyn joined the team to improve on lab skills & work towards solving the issue of diagnostics at the point of care in developing countries.
Shapoor Mohamadi - Outreach Participant
2rd year BSc Chemical & Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London
Shapoor is an accidental would be biochemist. 12 times he has started a university degree and 12 times he decided it wasn’t for him! Along the way Shapoor has gained qualifications in IT, Business, Mathematics & Natural Sciences. His favourite subject was Natural Sciences which he chose to take further by studying a BSc in Chemical & Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. The flexibility of Birkbeck has enabled Shapoor to work full-time and study part-time towards a BSc. He has worked hard and stuck to this degree route and has now successfully completed his second year.
Shapoor has an interest in a wide range of academic subjects ranging from philosophy to international relations. One of his main passions is fine literature (particularly poetry). Shapoor has a keen interest in fashion and fancy/colourful hats!

Tim Walker - Policy and Practice Advisor
BSc Biological Sciences (Biotechnology) Graduate, University of Edinbrough; MRes Microbiology (Distinction) Graduate, Birkbeck, University of London
Tim is fascinated by the rich diversity of the microbial world, and how this can be utilised for biotechnological and medical usage.
During this time he felt restless and enrolled on the part-time MSc Microbiology course at Birkbeck. Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. "Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made". He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes."
Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice & Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist. Tim is very excited by the project we are developing and looks forward to showing everyone at the Giant Jamboree everything we have achieved!
