						Birkbeck as an institution prides itself on being accessible to all, and so Birkbeck's iGEM team made sure it was also. We had team members dedicated to the project from the outset but, because of working full-time and other commitments extending through the entirety of the project, could only commit a limited amount of time. They therefore used their expertise to aid particular aspects of the project when possible. Their roles in the project are also outlined below.

Along the way Shapoor has gained qualifications in IT, Business, Mathematics &amp; Natural Sciences. His favourite subject was Natural Sciences which he chose to take further by studying a BSc in Chemical &amp; Molecular Biology at Birkbeck, University of London. The flexibility of Birkbeck has enabled Shapoor to work full-time and study part-time towards a BSc. He has worked hard and stuck to this degree route and has now successfully completed his second year.Shapoor has an interest in a wide range of academic subjects ranging from philosophy to international relations.

Almost immediately he rediscovered his passion for microbiology and the following year he quit recruitment and transferred to a full-time MRes research project. The project was to assess the activity of a light-activated antimicrobial surface. &quot;Despite blowing my life savings and having to also work part-time to support myself, it was the best decision I've ever made&quot;. He fell in love with research and his hard work has earnt me a BBSRC PhD scholarship to investigate the biosynthetic capabilities of Actinomycetes.&quot;Tim's effort in the Owligos team is around Practice &amp; Policy and Sponsorship. Tim is proud to be a part of the inaugural Birkbeck iGEM team because, without the flexible learning opportunities they offer to full-time working people, he wouldn't have been able to complete a Masters and wouldn't now be living his dream as a research microbiologist.
