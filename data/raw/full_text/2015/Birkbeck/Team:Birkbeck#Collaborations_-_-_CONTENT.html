    					This June <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:UCL">University College London</A>, Birkbeck and  <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:London_Biohackspace">London Biohackspace</A> attended a jointly organised iGEM boot camp featuring BioBrick making in the lab, presentations from key iGEM team advisors as well as Skype talks with iGEM Headquarters representatives, DIY spectrophotometers, wiki design and extra lab skills.
					</P><P>
    					The DIY track group assembled a functional spectrophotometer at the London Biohackspace using 3D printed components, while the Software track group learnt
    					the basic progrsmming required in developing the iGEM wiki and submitting BioBricks to the registry. Finally, the extra lab group received insights into
    					the most efficient cutting edge cloning technologies relevant to iGEM work.

only a reactant and a final product, a user can obtain possible paths using our program. Gil helps people find the most plausible de novo pathway just like Google Maps.&quot; We are thrilled to have had our opinions taken into consideration as part of this process!
