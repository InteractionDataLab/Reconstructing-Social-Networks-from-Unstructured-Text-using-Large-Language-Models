The C-terminus of the protein (ORF-314) contains the recognition site that confers binding specificity to the OmpC membrane protein of <I>E.coli</I>[1].</P><P>To transform ORF-314 sequence into a BioBrick basic part, we had the coding sequence synthesised, including the BioBrick prefix and suffix. The sequence was optimised to remove illegal restriction sites. We restricted both our synthesised ORF-314 and the linearised plasmid backbones (pSB1C3 for shipping, and pSB1K3 for further processing) with <I>EcoRI</I> and <I>PstI</I> restriction enzymes, before ligating the two pieces together using T4 DNA ligase. Success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with <I>EcoRI</I> and <I>PstI</I> restriction enzymes followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1), with pSB1C3 alone and ORF314 alone as controls. The construct was also confirmed by sequencing. ORF-314 was submitted as <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1846000">BBa_K1846000.</A></P><P><B>Figure 1. Agarose gel electrophoresis of ORF314 inserted in pSB1C3 and restricted with <I>EcoRI</I> and <I>PstI</I>. The expected band sizes are 1 kb for ORF314 and 2 kb for pSB1C3. Successful results were obtained for samples 2 and 3.</B></P><H3><B>stf (short tail fibre) gene (BBa_K1846004)</B></H3><P>The <I>stf</I> gene encodes the short tail fibres found in the Ur-lambda bacteriophage, the original isolate [1]. The wild type lambda strain (λ-PaPa) that is most commonly used in research carries a frameshift mutation in the <I>stf</I> gene sequence producing no such fibres. It has been shown that the presence of these additional thin tails results in the more efficient adsorption to the host, <I>E.coli</I> [1].
</P><P>The <I>stf</I> gene is a product of two open reading frames: ORF-401 and ORF-314. Introduction of 1 bp just after ORF-401 removes the frameshift fusing the two coding regions together which results in a functional short tail fibre protein consisting of 774 aa [2]. The C-terminal end of the stf protein (i.e. ORF-314) offers host receptor recognition for OmpC (Outer membrane protein C) on the surface of <I>E.coli</I>, widening receptor specificity and host range relative to λ-PaPa which only recognises the <I>E.coli</I> Maltoporin (<I>lamB</I> gene product) through its tip attachment protein J [1],[3]. Additionally, the C-terminus (ORF-314) displays a high level of homology with the gp37 of bacteriophage T4 [4].</P><P>The gene has been assembled using the synthesised ORF-401 with a linker sequence (removing the frameshift mutation) and ORF-314. The sequences were optimised to remove illegal restriction sites to make the sequence BioBrick-compatible. We cloned the two open reading frames and a linker into a single in-frame coding sequence (into a pSB1C3 backbone) using Gibson assembly. Success of the cloning procedure was confirmed by restriction with <I>EcoRI</I> and <I>SpeI</I> restriction enzymes followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 2) and in part by Sanger sequencing. This BioBrick was registered as part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1846004">BBa_K1846004</A>. </P><H3><B>tfa gene (BBa_K1846002)</B></H3><P>The tfa (tail fibre assembly) protein of bacteriophage lambda assists in the assembly of the stf (short tail fibre) protein into a functional short tail fibre [4],[5]. Tfa gene displays a high level of homology (~40%) with the gp38 of bacteriophage T4 [1],[4],[6].</P><P>Sequence was optimised to remove illegal restriction sites. The gene sequence is currently available only as part of a composite part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1846001">BBa_K1846001</A>.</P><H3><B>J gene (BBa_K1846008)</B></H3><P>The bacteriophage lambda J gene encodes the tip attachment protein that forms the base plate of the bacteriophage's tail. It is responsible for host protein recognition and specificity. C-terminal residues of protein J have direct binding interactions with the maltoporin (LamB), a membrane protein of <I>E.coli</I>, allowing irreversible attachment of the phage to the host and facilitating DNA injection [3],[7].
</P><P>We obtained this sequence as part of a collection of bacteriophage lambda parts from Technion, Haifa, Israel; this specific sequence was part of their previous BioBrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K784017">BBa_K784017</A>. The sequence contains a number of illegal PstI restriction sites. The BioBrick has been registered as part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1846008">BBa_K1846008</A>, however we haven't been able to complete the removal of the restriction sites in time,  so the part has not as yet been submitted to the registry.</P><B>References</B><P>[1] Hendrix, R.
