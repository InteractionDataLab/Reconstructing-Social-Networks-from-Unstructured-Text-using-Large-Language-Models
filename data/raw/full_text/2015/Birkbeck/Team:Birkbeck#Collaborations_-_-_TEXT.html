Getting London teams ready for iGEM
Click here to learn more about our joint organised London iGEM Bootcamp
This June University College London , Birkbeck and London Biohackspace attended a jointly organised iGEM boot camp featuring BioBrick making in the lab, presentations from key iGEM team advisors as well as Skype talks with iGEM Headquarters representatives, DIY spectrophotometers, wiki design and extra lab skills.
The DIY track group assembled a functional spectrophotometer at the London Biohackspace using 3D printed components, while the Software track group learnt          the basic progrsmming required in developing the iGEM wiki and submitting BioBricks to the registry. Finally, the extra lab group received insights into          the most efficient cutting edge cloning technologies relevant to iGEM work.
Publishing the Birkbeck iGEM experience
We gave our articles, written for the team diary and wiki, a greater lease of publicity by sharing them with Amoy iGEM Team for exposure via Newsletter.
Working on Technion iGEM BioBricks
Ongoing progress on Technion Israel iGEM parts from past competition that we are in the process of characterising and improving.
Reinforcing Interlab Data
Click here to learn more about how we collaborated for extra robustness in our InterLab Study results
We’ve shared our Interlab findings with London teams and are exchanging parts in order to further study their expression in different laboratories,          conditions and equipment. This will add additional layers of data, analysis and conclusions to our individual Interlab results.
Raising project awareness on YouTube
Click here to learn more about this video of Sean and Ariana in the Trinity iGEM serioes: So you think you can synthesise?
Our project-related, instructional and entertainment videos aim to engage the public in synthetic biology, safety and research impact. We provided these to iGEM Academy run by Trinity iGEM to enrich their content and spread the word about Birkbeck iGEM 2015 questing to tackle one of the current world          healthcare problems using bacteriophages.
Hosting London teams for Catch-Up and Presentations
Click here to learn more about the London Meet-Up we hosted on 31st July at Birkbeck.
Following on from the Boot Camp, we organised a London-wide meetup for the 5 teams to practise presentations, receive feedback, discuss ideas and socialise!
Providing modelling and experimentation experience
Our findings on the discrepancy between modelled and experimental results were discussed by all team members in a lot of detail, and provided to         Aalto-Helsinki iGEM to enable their further analysis. This will be invaluable for future iGEM projects and beyond.
Contributing to perception of universities taking part in iGEM
We teamed up with Tianjin iGEM to discuss the issue of participation of institutions in iGEM each year, and assess the factors that contribute most heavily to who can take part in the competition and how the results outcome influences investment and public relations for future teams.
Producing raw data for GM chewing gum degradation effort
Aix-Marseille iGEM team have awarded us Gold for our effort in obtaining survey data from the public in London on chewing gum consumption, knowledge, degradation and GMO perception.
Getting competitive in “So you think you can synthesise?
Our instructional videos on transformation entered the YouTube competition designed by Macquarie-Sydney Australia iGEM team where we are currently running in Round 3!
Contributing our perception of fracking for CU Boulder iGEM
Click here to learn more about our collaboration with CU Boulder iGEM, and watch some blunder videos!
BBK iGEM team members answered questions about fracking and alternative energy in an effort to investigate our perceptions of these very current and controversial topics that may benefit immensely from synthetic biology. Here are some blunder clips!
Double-checking Safety with iGEM Paris Saclay
By providing details of our project chassis, the safety issues we anticipated and the methods we used to ensure proper containment, we contributed to the community experience and knowledge base that will safeguard iGEM projects and iGEMers for years to come, fostering a sound approach to lab work and treating GMO with due caution.
Giving Feedback to iGEM Nankai on their iShare Platform
Our iGEM project experience, specifically to do with how difficult it was to obtain all necessary experimental materials as well as insight, formed the basis of our feedback to iGEM Nankai with regards to their development of iShare, an iGEM sharing facility between teams to facilitate exchange of items. This will prove key to accelerating future iGEM work and communication between representatives worldwide using the same parts.
Contributing attitudes to iGEM Korea_U_Seoul of scientist usage of Open Data, Open Source software and Open Access in the context of Synthetic Biology
We shared our experiences and enthusiasm for sharing software for iGEM, especially for bioinformatics and modelling, to help develop 'Gil', described by iGEM Korea_U_Seoul "The software ‘Gil’ is a bio-pathfinder for synthetic biologists. Given only a reactant and a final product, a user can obtain possible paths using our program. Gil helps people find the most plausible de novo pathway just like Google Maps." We are thrilled to have had our opinions taken into consideration as part of this process!
