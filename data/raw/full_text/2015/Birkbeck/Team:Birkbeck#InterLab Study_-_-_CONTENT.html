Grren fluorescent protein (<I>gfp</I>-mut3b – E0040) was used as a reporter for expression and the level of gene expression was determined by measuring the fluorescence of each <I>E. coli</I> DH5α strain generated. The promoters under investigation were designed by John Anderson and submitted by the Berkeley iGEM 2006 group (with reference to <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J23100">Part description</A>&amp;<A href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:UC_Berkeley/2006">UC Berkeley/2006</A>).</P><P>The previous InterLab Study (2014), described by Dr. Jake Beal (iGEM Foundation) at the 2014 Jamboree in the following <A href="https://vimeo.com/120088076">link</A>, was composed of 45 teams representing 18 countries globally. As part of our project in designing a phage-based diagnostic tool, detection of signals is fundamental to our end goal. Studying the expression levels of different promoters in a standardized fashion maybe one way in which an output can be achieved with our product.</P><H2><U><B>Cloning</B></U></H2><P>In order to investigate the promoter expression, <I>gfp</I> had to be expressed by each of the promoters. The BioBrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13504"> BBa_I3504</A> contains a ribosome binding site (RBS – <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034">B0034</A>), <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_E0040">gfp-mut3b (E0040)</A> and two terminators (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0010">B0010</A>&amp;<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0012">B0012</A>). Cloning this BioBrick into different promoters will result in the expression of <I>gfp</I> and therefore detectable fluorescence from cells. The level of fluorescence detected from each of the promoters can be used to assess promoter activity.</P><P>The positive control in this study was; <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I20270">pSB1C3-Bba_I20270</A>. Two negative controls were used; <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0040">pSB1C3-BBa_R0040</A>&amp;<I>E. coli</I> DH5α containing no plasmid</P><P>2 A assembly was carried out to make all 3 devices. The <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13504"> BBa_I3504 BioBrick</A> was in a plasmid backbone containing an ampicillin resistance cassette with each of the promoter devices in a plasmid backbone containing a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (P1 [<A href="http://parts.igem.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23101"> BBa_J23101</A>], P2 [<A href="http://parts.igem.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23106"> BBa_J23106</A>] &amp; P3 [<A href="http://parts.igem.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23117"> BBa_J23117</A>]). </P><P>The BBa_I3504 plasmid was digested with <I>XbaI</I>&amp;<I>PstI</I> in order to liberate the BBa_I3504 BioBrick. Each of the promoters were restricted with <I>SpeI</I>&amp;<I>PstI</I> in order to open up the plasmid and allow digested BBa_I3504 to anneal and be ligated into each of the promoters. The cloning process is diagrammatically shown in <B>Fig. 1</B>. 
</P><P><B>Fig. 1: Cloning Strategy for Device Construction</B>.</P><P>Three colonies from each transformation were picked and grown in 5 mL LB broth (supplemented with 35 μg/mL chloramphenicol). 500 μL of overnight culture was used to make glycerol stocks with the remaining culture used for miniprepping &amp; restriction diagnostics with <I>EcoRI</I>&amp;<I>PstI</I>. The expected restriction pattern is displayed in <B>Fig. 2</B> with the restriction diagnostic results being displayed in <B>Fig. 3</B>.

Plates were incubated at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C overnight in a static incubator.</P><P>3 discrete single colonies were used to inoculate 10 mL of LB broth supplemented with 35 μg/mL of chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C shaking at 250 rpm for 18 hours.</P><P>After 18 hours of incubation, the optical density (at a wavelength of 600 nm – OD<SUB>600</SUB>) of each culture was taken by aliquoting 200 μL of overnight culture into a 96-well plate and measuring the absorbance of each culture at OD<SUB>600</SUB>. Each culture was diluted back to an OD<SUB>600</SUB> = 0.5 by calculating the required volume of culture to be diluted in sterile LB broth; Volume used in inoculation = (Desired OD/Actual OD) × Volume to be inoculated. The diluted OD600 was measured and adjusted where required. When an OD<SUB>600</SUB> range between 0.475-0.525 was achieved, fluorescence of each culture was then measured after standardization. Fluorescence was measured using a BMG-LabTech FLUOstar omega plate reader. The excitation was 485 nm with fluorescence being measured at 520 nm</P><H2><U><B>Results</B></U></H2><P>The differences in means of each triplicate cultures were analysed. <B>Fig. 4</B> displays the mean of each of the standardize OD<SUB>600</SUB> with error bars representing 95% confidence intervals.

Inspecting the multiple comparison table, there is no significant difference between the means of the <I>E. coli</I> DH5α strains standardized. This data shows that each culture was successfully standardized by dilution to an OD<SUB>600</SUB> range between 0.475-0.525.</P><P><B>Fig. 5: Means of Standardized Devices OD<SUB>600</SUB></B>.</P><P>Each of the OD<SUB>600</SUB> = 0.5 dilutions were grouped and averaged. The data is displayed in <B>Fig. 4</B>. A <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Birkbeck/InterLab_Study/grouped_standardized_OD600">one-way ANOVA</A> between the different expression devices showed that there was no statistical differences between each expression device with regard to OD<SUB>600</SUB> standardization (P=0.284).</P><P><B>Fig. 6: Means of Standardized Triplicate Devices Fluorescence</B>.</P><P>The mean measurement of fluorescence for each triplicate is displayed in <B>Fig. 5</B>. There was <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Birkbeck/InterLab_Study/fluorescence_ANOVA_ungrouped">very highly statistically significant</A> differences the between all the triplicates (P&lt;0.001). However when comparing the same <I>E. coli</I> DH5α strain, there was no significant difference between the triplicates. This data shows that there is a difference between the different promoters under investigation &amp; the control <I>E. coli</I> DH5α strains with no difference between each of the triplicates.</P><P><B>Fig. 7: Means of Standardized Devices Fluorescence (au)</B>.</P><P>The data from <B>Fig. 5</B> was grouped according to expression device and is displayed in <B>Fig. 6</B>. Conducting a <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Birkbeck/InterLab_Study/fluorescence_ANOVA">one-way ANOVA</A> on the data; P1, P2 &amp; positive control expression devices shows a very highly significant difference between all other expression devices (P&lt;0.001). Comparing the mean of P3 device with P1, P2 &amp; positive control, there appears to be a very highly significant difference (P&lt;0.001) with P3 showing the lowest level of fluorescence. The P3 device shows no statistical significant difference between the B0012 &amp;<I>E. coli</I> DH5α negative controls (P=0.704 &amp; P=0.243 respectively). There is no statistically significant difference observed between the two negative controls (P=0.967).</P><H2><U><B>Conclusion</B></U></H2><P>Results from this study indicate that the P1-<I>gfp</I> expression device yields the highest expression levels after 18 hours of growth. P2-<I>gfp</I> expression device has a higher expression level than the positive control but a lower level of expression when compared to the P1-<I>gfp</I> expression device. Te P3-<I>gfp</I> expression device has a fluorescence level which is comparible to the negative controls used in this study. Each of the <I>gfp</I> expression devices P1, P2 &amp; positive control from this study were further characterised in our InterLab Study Additional Results <B>Fig. 9: Growth Curves of Different Strains of E. coli DH5α Following Culture Fluorescence</B>, which is in the tab below.
