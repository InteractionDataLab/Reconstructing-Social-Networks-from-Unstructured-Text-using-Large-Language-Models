BBa_K1714007
Our favorite composite part is BBa_K1714007 .This part has PBAD as a promoter, BBa_B0034 as an RBS, thanatin inserted Ag43 as a CDS, double terminator as a terminator. We recommend this part because of its low toxicity for host cells in inactivate form and it secret thanatins by Asp-N treating. Secreted thanatins are toxic for bacteria. So by seeing this result, we can succeeded in difficult thanatin production by using inactivate form using Ag43. This part successfully secret thanatins and caused toxicity. So we succeeded in making new way to secret AMPs by using Ag43.
