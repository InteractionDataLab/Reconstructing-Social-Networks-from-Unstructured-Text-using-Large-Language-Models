Safe Lab Work
In our lab, we take measures for safety under Japanese low and Hokkaido University guidelines. Please see About Our Lab for more information.
Safe Project Design
In our project, we have designed biodevices that make antimicrobial-peptides (AMPs). In the real world, we could be used in factories or for food, but this time, we have worked on them only in lab level. If it will be developed to be used in real world, we need to take measures to prevent genetically modified organisms to be released to the environment.
