Masaya MITSUMOTO
Biologocal Sciences (Macromolucular Functions), School of Science (B3)
Hello! I'm Masaya Mitsumoto and I'm learning chemistry, physics in molecular biology in my department. I want to create "completely" artificial organisms in the future. So at first, I want to create proteins with artificial functions by solving protein folding problem (of course, it's very very difficult...).
Yuri SAKAI
Division of Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science (B3)
I like reading books and painting pictures.
Tamaro SAKURAI
