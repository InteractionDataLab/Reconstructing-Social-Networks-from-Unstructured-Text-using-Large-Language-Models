Here is the search box in search page:</P><P>First,enter the keyword, like “protein”
Then click button ‘Device’
Button ‘Advanced’ is used to change weight,click it and you will see this page:</P><P>Change weight as you like,
For example:
Set Uses to 1
Set Part Results to 20
Set Confirmed_times to 1
Set Number_comments to 1</P><P>
        Leave the rest as the defaults and click button ‘Sure’.
You will see result like this:</P><H1>Search for Part:</H1><P>Searching for part is a similar process
For example,
We enter keyword ”DNA”,click button ‘Part’ and change weight the same as the example of searching for device above
(Set Uses to 1;set Part Results to 20;set Confirmed_times to 1;set Number_comments to 1).
Then you will see the result as below:</P><H1>Construct:</H1><P>Construct page can help you design a new device intelligently. 
Let us see a simple example:
Drag the icons from the left of the page and construct a simple device with a regulator,coding area,a reporter and a terminator.
Now you will see your device in graphical form:</P><P>Click button ‘Advise’ and select biobricks for your device.You can fill in functions if you want.
History id will show all ID of biobricks in your device.</P><P>When you have finished a device, you can click &quot;Next-Evaluate&quot; button on the bottom right corner to evaluate this device.</P><H1>Evaluate:</H1><P>This page can help you evaluate a device,this device can be a existing device or a brand new device you have just designed.
Continuing with the example of ‘Construct’.When you have clicked button ‘Next-Evaluate’,you will jump to Evaluate page like this:</P><P>You can delete any of these biobricks or insert new biobricks to change this device.
Of course,you can delete all and refill ID to start the evaluation of a new device.
Choose Accuracy on the top left of the page,then click  &quot;Evaluate&quot;to start the evaluation.
After a short wait,you may get results as below:</P><P>Here you can see overall score of the device and ‘Optimal ID’.
‘Optimal ID’ is a list of biobricks recommended to replace original biobrick,you may choose biobricks from them to optimize this device.</P><P>Do not forget use button ‘Upload’ if you want to upload this device to our database.  </P><H1>Upload:</H1><P>
        Upload page is very easy to use,
Continuing with our example,</P><P>
        If you want to upload a new biobrick to our database,just fill in all necessary information and click button ‘Submit’.
When you see</P><P>That means you have uploaded successfully .</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
