Our software ‘Base’ have four based functions:
Search,Construct,Evaluate and Upload.
This document will use some specific examples
to help you learn how to use our software.
Search for device:
When you want you use our software to search for a device,you may follow such steps:
Here is the search box in search page:
First,enter the keyword, like “protein”
Then click button ‘Device’
Button ‘Advanced’ is used to change weight,click it and you will see this page:
Change weight as you like,
For example:
Set Uses to 1
Set Part Results to 20
Set Confirmed_times to 1
Set Number_comments to 1
Leave the rest as the defaults and click button ‘Sure’.
You will see result like this:
Search for Part:
Searching for part is a similar process
For example,
We enter keyword ”DNA”,click button ‘Part’ and change weight the same as the example of searching for device above
(Set Uses to 1;set Part Results to 20;set Confirmed_times to 1;set Number_comments to 1).
Then you will see the result as below:
Construct:
Construct page can help you design a new device intelligently.
Let us see a simple example:
Drag the icons from the left of the page and construct a simple device with a regulator,coding area,a reporter and a terminator.
Now you will see your device in graphical form:
Click button ‘Advise’ and select biobricks for your device.You can fill in functions if you want.
History id will show all ID of biobricks in your device.
When you have finished a device, you can click "Next-Evaluate" button on the bottom right corner to evaluate this device.
Evaluate:
This page can help you evaluate a device,this device can be a existing device or a brand new device you have just designed.
Continuing with the example of ‘Construct’.When you have clicked button ‘Next-Evaluate’,you will jump to Evaluate page like this:
You can delete any of these biobricks or insert new biobricks to change this device.
Of course,you can delete all and refill ID to start the evaluation of a new device.
Choose Accuracy on the top left of the page,then click  "Evaluate"to start the evaluation.
After a short wait,you may get results as below:
Here you can see overall score of the device and ‘Optimal ID’.
‘Optimal ID’ is a list of biobricks recommended to replace original biobrick,you may choose biobricks from them to optimize this device.
Do not forget use button ‘Upload’ if you want to upload this device to our database.
Upload:
Upload page is very easy to use,
Continuing with our example,
If you want to upload a new biobrick to our database,just fill in all necessary information and click button ‘Submit’.
When you see
That means you have uploaded successfully .
