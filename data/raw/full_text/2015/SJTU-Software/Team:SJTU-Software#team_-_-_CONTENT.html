Known for its  abundant teaching resources and cutting-end scientific researching level. SJTU not only keep its edge on traditional advantage fields like naval architecture, engineering and electronic, but also make great progress in fields like life science, medicine, finance and so on.  Though the school of life science and biotechnology of SJTU does not has a long history, it has developed dramastically during these years, especially bioinformatics, which ranks first in China.   SJTU first had software team in 2014. This year, we have a brand-new software team: the 2015 SJTU software team. Our team is supported by the school of life science and biotechnology. Three professors of our this school became our mentors who helped us to organize the team and provided us with helpful advices. The team members are most from Bioinformatics. Some from the school of electronic, information and electrical engineering and one is from the school of media and design. The combination of students from different majors let our team be more creative and efficient. 
    We spend most of our time finishing the software in the bioinformatics computer room where we can use computer and Internet freely and close to mentors’ offices. Here we have some pictures about our daily work situation. Although the summer in Shanghai is hot and sometimes coding was boring and drove us crazy when we had to work 24/7 for the deadline. We still had so much fun this summer and finished our project finally!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="members"><H1 style="position: absolute; left: 45%; z-index: 1000; font-size: 40px; overflow: visible">Members</H1></DIV><DIV class="advisorContent"><P class="panelTitle"><B>Advisors&amp;Mentors</B></P><P>We would like to thank the following people who spare no efforts to help us and provide us with many precious advises.
     Chaochun Wei (associate professor, Ph.D. Supervisor. 
     In 2006, he got a PhD in computer science in Washington University(St Louis).
