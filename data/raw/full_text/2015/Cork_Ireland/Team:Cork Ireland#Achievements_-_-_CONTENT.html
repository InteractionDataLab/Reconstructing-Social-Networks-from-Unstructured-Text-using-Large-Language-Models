		Integrate findings of Human Practices investigation into design and execution of project:
		</H3><P>
		Taking advantage of a medical summer elective at UCC, we decided as part of our project to send one of our members to an African hospital in Malawi. Donnchadh spent the month of June there investigating the usefulness and potential application of our detection system. While he was there he took this opportunity to explain the scientific concepts of synthetic biology and of our Basehunter System to the medical and laboratory staff. He spoke to the local people and at schools about the upcoming field of synthetic biology and our aims 
		with the iGEM project. He also spoke to a witchdoctor about modern science and the medicine it is capable of producing using synthetic biology.
		</P><P>
		While Donnchadh was in Malawi, he identified a potential application for our novel DNA detection system. He discovered through interviewing the laboratory staff at Nhkoma, spending time on the hospital wards and from our survey that there is a need for more rapid testing of certain 
		diseases which can be done cheaply and simply. He found that running machinery in these countries can be expensive so a 
		low cost alternative such as Basehunter is favourable.
		</P><P>
		In our talks with an experienced biomedical scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey, we found that a niche exists even in developed labs 
		for a rapid diagnostic for <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> (TB). As TB is slow growing, it is difficult to culture. For this reason, 
		lab results are often delayed even weeks for a confirmation of results. Basehunter could provide a simple and rapid method 
		to identify TB in samples. For this reason we designed a TB detector and began to verify 
		that it functions as well as the other detectors. In this way, our Human practices investigations highlighted a real world problem 
		that we sought to address.
		</P><H3>Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project:</H3><P>
		We demonstrated a functional prototype of our project in our own lab. We then collaborated with both TCD and UCL to see if the 
		prototype would be functional in another laboratory setting. Find our <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Cork_Ireland/Design">design</A> here.

		</H3><P>In July we met with the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Cork_Ireland/Collaborations">Trinity College Dublin</A> iGEM team who are taking part in iGEM for the first time. We provided feedback on their project work and told them what to expect at the Jamboree. We were in contact with the team in its early days before the team members were selected and stressed the need for a diverse team from many backgrounds. This was something we learned at iGEM last year and knew it was important to relay this advice. We also suggested that the team should not focus entirely on lab work and that engaging with the community throughout their project is encouraged.</P><P>Over the course of working on the projects, we kept in contact with the team and aided them in their efforts to create a <A href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjPJThAlEuACPeOl_VLHlNw">Youtube Channel “iGEM Academy”</A>with videos of common lab protocols by providing a video tutorial of our “Detector Reaction” for use with our Basehunter parts.</P></DIV><DIV id="silver_dis"><H2>Silver Medal Discussion:</H2><H3>
		Experimentally validate that another new BioBrick Part (ii) of your own design and construction works as expected &amp; document 
		the characterisation of this part on the Registry:
		</H3><P>
		HPV 55bp Detector Part was designed, constructed and validated over the course of the project. Its sensitivity and specificity was determined and an optimised protocol for its construction and use was developed.

		Identify, investigate &amp; address issues relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual 
		property rights (Human Practices) in the context of the project:
		</H3><P>
		This year Cork iGEM identified intellectual property rights as an issue. We interviewed <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Cork_Ireland/Practices#interviews">Cathal Garvey</A> to 
		investigate the issue and see his views on the issue.
		</P><P>
		Issues relating to the safety of the system for use as a diagnostic were identified. As with all diagnostics, this system must be 
		optimised, standardised and deemed as good as or better than current procedures. The use of live cells in a diagnostic system is a 
		unique feature which may lead to unforeseen complications such as unsuitable growth conditions in some settings or the impact of 
		contaminating growth on results. To address this, we investigated suitable controls and validates our results by having outside 
		labs (TCD &amp; UCL) carry out our tests. We also sought the advice of experienced Biomedical Scientist, Dr. Brigid Lucey on the issue.
		</P><P>
		Another aspect of our human practices work was that done by team member Donnchadh in Malawi. The issue of sustainability of our detector 
		in a real life lab setting was investigated by Donnchadh as he visited hospital labs in Malawi where the detector may theoretically be used. 
		He surveyed staff members on the equipment and reagents they had and whether they believed such a detector was a viable and sustainable tool. 
		We considered this in the design of our prototype and what to include in kits sent to <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Cork_Ireland/Collaborations">TCD &amp; UCL</A> labs.
		</P><P>
		While in Malawi, Donnchadh evaluated resources in the lab and what diagnostics tests are available to patients of that hospital. 
		Speaking to Dr.Bridget Lucey, a Biomedical Scientist in Ireland and the Biomedical Scientists working in Malawi- the issue of social justice was very clear regarding the standard of diagnostic tests available. With Basehunter, we can help bridge the gap between the inadequate resources and tests available in Malawi and those available in Ireland. This innovative Basehunter technology will make first world standard health care diagnostics available to all. Our project aims to bring first class molecular 
		diagnostics to areas where it currently is not by providing an alternative to expensive equipment such as PCR machines. With this in mind, 
		we designed our kits to be low cost, easy to ship and practical for use in labs which may be small and under-resourced. Blaine Doyle, CEO of GlowDx (which is a molecular diagnostic company), gave advised us on how to keep our costs as low as possible while ensuring an effective detector. 
		</P><P>
		Knowledge of  synthetic biology was also limited in Malawi and this may hinder acceptance of our detector. To address this, Donnchadh 
		explained our project and gave detail on what exactly synthetic biology is to workers in the hospital lab. We also learned of a culture 
		of seeking medical care from witch doctors in Malawi. Donnchadh explained the concept of synthetic biology to this figure in the community 
		where he worked, and got her approval of this and an acknowledgment that other advancements in science and medicine can aid in healing also.
