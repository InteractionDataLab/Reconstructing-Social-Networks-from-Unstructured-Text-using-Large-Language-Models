We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements. 
</P><P>
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
</P><H4>References</H4><P>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.</P><H4>Inspiration</H4><P>See how other teams have described and presented their projects: </P><UL><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Imperial/Project"> Imperial</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project_Overview"> UC Davis</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Overview">SYSU Software</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
