55bp HPV Detector (K1698001)
Sequence: CTCTTCAcctgtgtaggtgttgaggtaggtcgtggGTACCAATAATAA AAGCTtcagccattaggtgtgggcattagtggCACTGC
Part may be activated by established protocol to become a detector plasmid for a 55bp Target sequence, found on the HPV L1 Capsid gene.
For protocol for construction of detector by digestion of plasmid see here .  The Target is located in the HPV genome flanked by HaeIII restriction sites. Detector may work best if genomic sample first digested with this enzyme to create target fragment of the correct length.  The part was cloned into a plasmid containing BBa_K584001 to allow examination of cells following successful transformation using a fluorescent microscope. Also, presence of GFP expressing part meant that detector colonies could be differentiated from control colonies. For more information see here .
The sequence of this part with K584001 biobrick part may be found on the Registry of Standard Parts.
For more information on how the detector plasmid worked see here .
Assessment of this detector parts selectivity may also be seen here here .
62bp SRY (K1698002)
Sequence: GCTCTTCACCATGTCAAGCGCCCCATGAATGCATTT ATGGGTACCAATAATAAAAGCTTGTGGTCC CGTGGTGAGAGGCACAAGTTGGCACTGC
Part may be activated by established protocol to become a detector plasmid for a 62bp Target sequence, found on the SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome.  Further optimisation of part is needed for use in distinguishing male and female genomic DNA. Part is accurate in detecting target when isolated from a genomic sample.

32bp SRY Detector (K1698003)
Sequence: GCTCTTCAgttgcctcaacaaaactgGTACCAAT AATAAAAGCTtacaaccttctgcaCACTGC
Part may be activated by established protocol to become a detector plasmid for a 32bp Target sequence, found on the SRY gene, located on the Y chromosome.  For protocol for construction of detector by digestion of plasmid see here .  The part was cloned into a plasmid containing BBa_K584001 (after biobrick prefix) to allow examination of cells following successful transformation using a fluorescent microscope. Also, presence of GFP expressing part meant that detector colonies could be differentiated from control colonies. For more information see here .

Sequence: GCTCTTCTCAGCCTTCCCGgtacctaa ttcggatcCGCTGGCTACCCCACTGC
Part may be activated by established protocol to become a detector plasmid for a 24bp target sequence found on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome  For protocol for construction of detector by digestion of plasmid see here .  The sequence of this part with K584001 biobrick part may be found on the Registry of Standard Parts.
