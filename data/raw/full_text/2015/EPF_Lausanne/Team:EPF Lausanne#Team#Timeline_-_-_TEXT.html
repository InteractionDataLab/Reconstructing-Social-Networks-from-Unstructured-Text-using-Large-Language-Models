The bible
The E. Coli part of our project is strongly based on the paper of Bikard et al. "Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system". Bikard sent us his strains JEN202, JEN202+PWJ89 and DH5A+PWJ66. We also ordered a plasmid containing dCas9 and the synthetic DNA encoding fou our gRNAs.
Blast
02.04.2015
In our project dCas9 target DNA sequences using gRNAs and acts as an activator or an inhibitor depending on its position. Axel and Cyril created a C++ program to blast random generated  gRNA sequences on the E. Coli or Yeast genome.
And the winner is...
26.03.2015
...the new framework for biologic circuits using dCas9.
The lab starts!
24.03.2015 - 26.03.2015
TAs start to train us in the lab: medium and agar plates preparation
Brainstorming finalists
19.03.2015
Three cool ideas came out of the brainstorming:
A new framework for biologic circuits
Lung cancer therapy using dCas9
Cell-cell communication through exosomes
Brainstorming
26.02.2015 - 12.03.2015
The team is split into small groups, brainstorming for an interesting project that will occupy us during the summer.
First meeting: iGEM officially starts!
19.02.2015
First meeting with everyone: 12 teammates, 7 TAs and 3 advisors.
