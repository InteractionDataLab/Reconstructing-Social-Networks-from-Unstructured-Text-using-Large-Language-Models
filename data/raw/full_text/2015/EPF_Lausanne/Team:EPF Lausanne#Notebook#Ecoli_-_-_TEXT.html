Construction of pdCas9-w
07.05.2015 - 01.06.2015 + 28.07.2015 - 05.08.2015
pdCas9-w contains a gene that produces dCas9 fused to the w subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), which recruits RNAP, controlled by a Tetracycline inducible promoter.
Materials and method
Open pdCas9-bacteria by Phusion PCR (cf. Protocols) with primers f_Gbs_pdCas9 and r_Gbs_pdCas9 + PCR product purification (cf. Protocols) + agarose gel electrophoresis of 2 µL purified PCR products. pdCas9-bacteria was a gift from Stanley Qi (Addgene plasmid # 44249) [1].

Linearized pdCas9-w is expected to be 6705 bp.We tested many parameters: HF vs. GC buffer, different annealing temperatures and different extension times. All samples visible on gel were successfully amplified (cf. Fig.1).For next steps, sample from lane 1 (cf. Fig.1) was used.

Gibson assembly of pdCas9-w
Gibson assembly, transformation: 19.05.2015. Colony PCR: 29.05.2015. Restriction analysis: 01.06.2015.
Colony PCR yields 666 bp amplicons if Gibson assembly worked and 396 bp amplicons if the plasmid self-ligated.Lane "C" is a negative control: PCR was run with all components except template DNA. It is empty which means there is no contamination (cf. Fig3d).Colony PCR shows that Gibson assembly worked for some samples (cf. Fig.3). To avoid working with too many samples, we kept the ones from lanes 16, 22, 25, 31, 37 and 43 for the next steps.
pdCas9-w was analyzed by restriction digest with BamHI and KpnI separately, both are single cutters in pdCas9 and double cutters in pdCas9-w. Digestion by BamHI yields fragments of 6147 bp and 834 bp, digestion by KpnI yields fragments of 4534 bp and 2447 bp (cf. Fig.4). Too much ladder was loaded so it is difficult to estimate the size of the fragments. The smaller fragments are also very difficult to see. By looking at the relative heights, we can see that all colonies seem to have the w subunit insert. There is only the undigested sample for colony 16 that is not visible, probably due to an error while loading the gel.
Sequencing confirmed that sample 22 is in fact pdCas9-w. We used this sample for the next steps and stored it as a glycerol stock (c.f. Protocols).
Fig.3 - Gels of colony PCR of dCas9-w Gibson assembly products. Gibson assembly worked for samples that have 666 bp amplicons: lanes 5, 6, 16, 22, 25-28, 30, 31, 37, 41, 43. All other lanes are self-ligation (396 bp amplicons).
Ladder: 1kb Generuler.
Fig.4 - Gels of restriction digest of pdCas9-w Gibson assembly products. Each colony is present on gels in triplicates: undigested (7kb but migrates faster than linear DNA), digested by BamHI (6147 bp + 834 bp) and digested by KpnI (4534 bp + 2447 bp). All digestions worked and show that plasmids contain the w subunit. Undigested plasmid for sample 16 is not visible due to a technical error.
Ladder: 1kb Generuler.
Site-directed mutagenesis of dCas9-w
Site-directed mutagenesis: 28.07.2015, 29.07.2015. Restriction digest: 05.08.2015
The first restriction digest analysis of many pdCas9-w-mut colonies was inconclusive, so we chose one colony to do a second restriction digest analysis (cf. Fig.5). First, note that the ladder did not work well so we will ignore it and only look at the relative heights and number of bands. Also, lanes 1, 4 and 6 concerned another experiment so we will ignore them.
pdCas9-w and pdCas9-w-mut undigested (cf. Fig.5 lanes 2 and 8) should both contain the 7 kb circular plasmid. pdCas9-w digested with BsrBI (cf. Fig.5 lane 7) and pdCas9-w-mut digested with EcoRI or BsrBI separately (cf. Fig.5 lanes 10 and 11) should contain the linearized 7 kb plasmid. pdCas9-w digeted with EcoRI (cf. Fig.5 lane 5) should contain two fragments of 5.6 kb and 1.4 kb. pdCas9-w digested with EcoRI and BsrBI (cf. Fig.5 lane 3) should contain three fragments of 3.2 kb, 2.4 kb and 1.4 kb, pdCas9-w-mut digested with the same enzymes (cf. Fig.5 lane 9) should contain two fragments of 4.6 kb and 2.4 kb.We can see that the pattern on the gel is correct so the mutagenesis worked. Notice than the circular plasmids migrated less than the linear plasmids and also that the undigested plasmids seem to contain a second smaller fragment which is probably contamination.

Construction of pdCas9-w-sgRNAs - 08.07.2015 - 02.09.2015
pdCas9-w-sgRNAs contain a gene producing dCas9-w controlled by a Tetracycline inducible promoter and sgRNA producing cassette (constitutive promoter).
These experiments consist of inserting one or two sgRNA producing cassettes (cf. Fig.6) into pdCas9-w. In part 1, one sgRNA (X0, X4, X35, Z0, Z4 or Z35) was inserted into pdCas9-w by Gibson assembly. For technical reasons, we were unable to make most constructs with two inserted cassettes using this method. In part 2, we extracted sgRNA cassettes from existing constructs and inserted them in other constructs that already contained one other sgRNA cassette.

Open pdCas9-w by restriction digest
16.07.2015, 19.07.2015, 26.07.2015, 02.08.2015 (repeats)
The digested and undigested plasmids have the same size. Circular fragments migrates differently (generally faster) than linear fragments of the same size. This means that the undigested and digested plasmid will migrate differently. Even though the ladder is not clear, we see that the digested sample migrated more slowly than the undigested sample (cf. Fig.7). The restriction digest was successful.Digestion was repeated at least 4 times, we needed it for many PCRs.
Fig.7 - Gel of pdCas9-w digested by BamHI (lane 1) and undigested (lane 2). Digested plasmid is lower on gel, which means digestion worked.

Amplified sgRNA cassettes are expected to be about 370 bp.sgRNA cassette Z0 was amplified with Q5 PCR, both samples were successfully amplified (cf. Fig.8a). sgRNA cassette Z4 was amplified with Phusion PCR, samples 3 and 4 were successfully amplified (cf. Fig.8b). sgRNA cassette Z35 was successfully amplified with Phusion PCR, it is hardly visible on the gel (cf. Fig.8c). sgRNA cassette X0 was successfully amplified with Phusion PCR (cf. Fig.8d). sgRNA cassette X4 was successfully amplified with Phusion PCR (cf. Fig.8e). sgRNA cassette X35 was successfully amplified with Phusion PCR (cf. Fig.8f).
Many PCRs were necessary to obtain all sgRNAs because of technical problems, such as PCR reactions not working and contamination of most of our tubes. Figures show only the samples that were used in the next steps.

Assemble pdCas9-w-sgRNA constructs
Gibson assembly, transformation: 16.07.2015, 17.07.2015, 27.07.2015, 28.07.2015, 29.07.2015, 04.08.2015, 05.08.2015 Colony PCR: 17.07.2015, 26.07.2015, 27.07.2015, 28.07.2015, 29.07.2015, 30.07.2015, 05.08.2015, 06.08.2015, 07.08.2015
In colony PCR, primers were placed such as amplicons are 445 bp if the plasmid self-ligated, 723 bp if Gibson assembly of 1 sgRNA cassette worked and 1120 bp if Gibson assembly of 2 sgRNA cassettes worked.
pdCas9-w-Z0 was obtained by a faulty assembly of pdCas9-w-Z0-Z4 that only took up 1 of the 2 sgRNA cassettes. Sample 20 of the colony PCR (cf. Fig.9a) was confirmed by sequencing to be pdCas9-w-Z0. Sample 13 seems to be pdCas9-w-Z0-Z4 according to colony PCR (cf. Fig.9a), but sequencing showed that it is pdCas9-w-X0-Z0, probably due to contamination of a tube. Colony PCR showed that all colonies tested for pdCas9-w-Z4 have the inserted sgRNA cassette (cf. Fig.9b). Sequencing confirmed that sample 5 is in fact pdCas9-w-Z4. Colony PCR showed that the Gibson assembly for sample 5 of pdCas9-w-Z35 seems to have worked (cf. Fig.9c) and sequencing confirmed that is the case. Colony PCR and sequencing showed that Gibson assembly was successful for sample 5 of pdCas9-w-X0 (cf. Fig.9d). Colony PCR of pdCas9-w-X4 showed many potentially good samples (cf. Fig.9e). Sequencing of sample 10 confirmed that it is in fact pdCas9-w-X4. Colony PCR and sequencing showed that Gibson assembly was successful for the colony of pdCas9-w-X35 (cf. Fig.9d).
Sequencing showed some mutations and/or deletions in the promoter and/or terminator for some of these samples. Because of time constraints, we decided to keep working with these and see the effect of the mutations during the activity assay.

Colony PCR primers are placed such as amplicons are 724 bp if Gibson assembly worked and are 390 bp if it did not (self-ligation). All necessary constructs were successfully obtained. Following colonies were kept for our constructs: colony #1 for pdCas9-w-Z0-Z4 (cf. Fig.11a), colony #4 (2nd attempt) for pdCas9-w-Z0-Z35 (cf. Fig.11c), colony #6 for pdCas9-w-Z4-Z35 (cf.

Gibson assembly, transformation: 10.08.2015, Colony PCR: 11.08.2015
Colony PCR showed two colonies for which Gibson assembly worked. However, images of gels of colony PCR were lost for technical reasons.Sequencing confirmed that both colonies were in fact pWJ89alt and that one had a deletion but the other one did not have any mutations. We kept the mutation-free colony and stored it in a Glycerol stock (cf. Protocols).
Construction of pAraC-sgRNA
25.08.2015 - 03.09.2015
We made 3 pAraC-sgRNA constructs: pAraC-Z0 and pAraC-Z4 contain sgRNA Z0 or Z4 producing cassettes controlled by promoter pBAD-AraC (positively regulated by arabinose) and pAraC-Z0-Z4 contains sgRNA Z0 producing cassette controlled by promoter pBAD-AraC and sgRNA Z4 producing cassette controlled by promoter pBAD (constitutively active).
Materials and method
Linearize pAraC by Q5 PCR (cf. Protocols) with primers f_opn_pAraC and r_opn_pAraC + agarose gel electrophoresis of 2 µL PCR products + PCR product purification (cf. Protocols). pAraC, called pFIP on Addgene, was a gift from Jay Keasling (Addgene plasmid #17565) [3].

Protocols) with primers f_Cl_pWJ89 and r_Sqc_T2reporter + agarose gel electrophoresis of 2 µL PCR products + sequencing (Microsynth)
Results
Open pWJ89alt by restriction digest
18.08.2015
Undigested pWJ89alt is expected to migrate faster than digested pWJ89alt. We observe both bands at the same height (cf. Fig.15). As there is a smear for the digested sample, it may have been partially digested.

Ladder: 1kb Generuler.
PCR Z4-to-X4
19.08.2015
Amplicons should be 425 bp. We did 4 samples with slightly different thermocycling settings. All were successfully amplified (cf. Fig.16) and we kept sample in lane 1 for next steps.

Gibson assembly pWJ89alt_Z4-to-X4
Gibson assembly and transformation: 28.08.2015, Colony PCR: 31.08.2015
Colony PCR primers were placed such as colonies for which the Gibson assembly worked would yield 2000 bp amplicons and those for which the Gibson assembly did not work (self-ligation) would yield 1500 bp amplicons.
The gel of the colony PCR shows that Gibson assembly worked for 3 of the tested colonies (cf. Fig.17). However, the other lanes do not show self-ligation, it seems like PCR did not work. We did not investigate this further.Sequencing of pWJ89alt_Z4-to-X4 from one of the 3 colonies confirmed that Gibson assembly did work and did not reveal any mutations.

Ladder: 2-log DNA ladder
Transistor activity assay
To do activity assays, we transformed (cf. Transformation Protocol) JEN202 cells with different constructs and measured the fluorescence with a plate reader or by flow cytometry. Results can be found on our Results page. A more detailed protocol can be found in this sheet
