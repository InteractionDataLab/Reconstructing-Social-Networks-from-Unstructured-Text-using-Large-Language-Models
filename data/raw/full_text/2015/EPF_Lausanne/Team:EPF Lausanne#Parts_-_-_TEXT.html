PARTS
All the parts we used for our project were added to the iGEM registry and documented to be available to everyone who wants to use it.
Our Collection
Have a look to our entire part collection containing all the biobricks we made.
Our best new part
This part is a pillar of our project and we are proud to make it available for you.
Our favorite composite part
This part was created from two separately existing parts and they work pretty well together. See by yourself.
