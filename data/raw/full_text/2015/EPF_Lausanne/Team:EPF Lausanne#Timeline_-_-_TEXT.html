Our project has a name!
July 8th 2015
After a few looongs discussions and many ideas we choose our name:Bio LOGIC - Logic Orthogonal gRNA-Implemented Circuits
Get back to work!
July 1st 2015
First of many meetings this summer! The day after our exams finished, we all got together to set some goals for the next few weeks. Let the fun begin!
Break time
June 1st - July 1st 2015
Our project was put on hold during our exams. :(
Working in the lab
April 21st - May 31st 2015
Lab work is slow because we have to follow all our courses at the same time. We are able to make our first construct pdCas9-w after mastering the art of PCR and Gibson assembly!
Presents!
April 14th 2015
The E. Coli part of our project is strongly based on the paper of Bikard et al. "Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system". Bikard sent us his strains JEN202, JEN202+PWJ89 and DH5A+PWJ66. What a generous guy!
Blast
April 2nd 2015
In our project dCas9-w targets DNA sequences using gRNAs and acts as an activator or an inhibitor depending on its position. Axel and Cyril created a C++ program to blast random generated  gRNA sequences on the E. Coli or Yeast genome.
And our project is...
March 26th 2015
...the new framework for biologic circuits using dCas9-w as a synthetic transcription factor. Go to our project description page to find out more!
The lab starts!
March 24th -31st 2015
Advisors start to train us in the lab: LB medium and LB agar plates preparation, bacterial cultures, minipreps, PCR, etc.
Brainstorming finalists
March 19th 2015
Three cool ideas came out of the brainstorming:
A new framework for biologic circuits
Lung cancer therapy using dCas9
Cell-cell communication through exosomes
Brainstorming
February 26th - March 12th 2015
The team is split into small groups to brainstorm for an interesting project.
First meeting: iGEM officially starts!
February 19th 2015
First meeting with everyone: 12 teammates, 7 advisors and 3 instructors.
