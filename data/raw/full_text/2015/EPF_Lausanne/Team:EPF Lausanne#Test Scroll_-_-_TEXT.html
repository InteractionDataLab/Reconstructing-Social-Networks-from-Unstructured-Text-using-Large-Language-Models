Comments
With low copy plasmid it is often difficult to obtain high concentrations (needed for sequencing). In these cases it's possible to proceed as follows: culture bacteria in 5 x 7mL tubes of LB medium and perform the miniprep for each tube separately until step 9. Then elute DNA by applying two times step 10 to each tube with the same 50µl of EB buffer.
