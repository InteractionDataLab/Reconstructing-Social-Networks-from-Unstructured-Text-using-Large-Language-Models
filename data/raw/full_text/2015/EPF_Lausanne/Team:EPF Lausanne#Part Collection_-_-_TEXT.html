OUR PART COLLECTION
E. coli
dCas9-ω
dCa9s-ω is our main tool to build our project in E. coli. This catalytically dead Cas9 fused to the RNA polymerase ω subunit can act as an activating or inhibiting transcription factor,  when provided with the right guide RNA.
BBa_K1723000
PAM rich URS J23117 promoter
This promoter is composed of the weak J23117 promoter, BBa_J23117, fused to a PAM rich Upstream Regulatory Sequence (URS). Remember that dCas9 can bind only to PAM-flanked target sites.
BBa_K1723001
sgRNA Z0 expressing cassette
sgRNA (single guide-RNA) Z0 inhibits PAM rich URS J23117 promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence Z0 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all sgRNAs.
BBa_1723002
sgRNA Z4 expressing cassette
sgRNA Z4 activates PAM rich URS J23117 promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence Z4 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all the sgRNAs.
This part is not RFC10 compatible. Removing bad restriction site would imply a lose of function.
BBa_1723003
sgRNA Z35 expressing cassette
sgRNA Z35 inhibits PAM rich URS J23117 promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence Z35 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all the sgRNAs.
BBa_K1723004
PAM rich URS J23117Alt promoter
This promoter was made on the same template as PAM rich URS J23117 promoter, but was mutated to use different sgRNAs. It is also fused to a PAM rich upstream regulatory region (URS). Remember that dCas9 can bind only to PAM-flanked target sites.
BBa_K1723005
sgRNA X0 expressing cassette
sgRNA (single guide-RNA) X0 inhibits PAM rich URS J23117Alt promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence X0 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all the sgRNAs.
BBa_K1723006
sgRNA X4 expressing cassette
sgRNA X4 activates PAM rich URS J23117Alt promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence X4 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all the sgRNAs.
BBa_K1723007
sgRNA X35 expressing cassette
sgRNA X35 activates PAM rich URS J23117Alt promoter when in complex with dCas9-ω. This part is an expressing cassette under the constitutive promoter pBAD. The sequence X35 makes this part unique, and the scaffold is a common part to all the sgRNAs.
BBa_K1723008
S. cerevisiae
dCas9_VP64
dCa9s-VP64 is the main tool to build our project in S. cerevisiae. This catalytically dead Cas9 fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and the eukaryotic transcription factor VP64 can act as an activating (or as an inhibitin) transcription factor when forming a complex with the appropriate guide RNA.
This part is not RFC10 compatible.
