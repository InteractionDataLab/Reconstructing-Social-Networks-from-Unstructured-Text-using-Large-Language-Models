Bio LOGIC
Logic Orthogonal gRNA Implemented Circuits
Engineering transcriptional logic gates to program cellular behavior remains an important challenge for synthetic biology. Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor.

Project
Background
Discover the ideas behind our project, from boolean logic to the the complete explanation of a biologic logic gate.
Description
Understand our project in the smallest details and explore the world of CRISPR-dCas9 with us.
Applications
Need a biosensor? Want a bacteria that can depollute a lake? Here are a few examples of how you could apply our technology for your own designs.
Modeling
Having a robust system is the key when devising new concepts. It enables testing in silico before ordering the expensive parts...
Achievements
In Vivo
Our achievements in the wet-lab, the result of a summer in the cold labrooms.
In silico
What we were able to do using the computer.
Judging
The criterias that we fulfilled for the different medals.
Parts
iGEM is all about Biobricks. Here is our contribution to this expanding library.
Policy and Practices
Ethics
Is working on the genome ethically correct? We tried to answer to this question.
Safety
Doing safe work with small organisms can be dangerous. Here is what we did to protect ourselves and the environment.
Human Practices
We do good ! Don't listen to the mass media.
Notebook
E. coli
See how we planned our summer and how it went for the E.coli team.
Yeast
Even if we used a beer icon Yeasts are not all about beer, discover how we experimented with this tough organism.
Protocols
These are the protocols that you need if you want to redo our work.
Team
