Gel extraction
QIAGEN protocol
Materials
Agarose gel
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
Procedure
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg = 100µL). For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG
Incubate at 50ºC for 10 minutes (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2-3 minutes to help dissolve the gel
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10µL 3M sodium acetate, pH5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube
To bind DNA, apply the sample to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes of >800 µL, load and spin again
To wash, add 0.75 mL Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube
Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2 ML collection tube for 1 min at 13'000 rpm to remove residual buffer
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
To elute DNA, add 50 µL Buffer EB or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µL Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.

Comments
With low copy plasmid it is often difficult to obtain high concentrations (needed for sequencing). In these cases it's possible to proceed as follows: culture bacteria in 5 x 7mL tubes of LB medium and perform the miniprep for each tube separately until step 9. Then elute DNA by applying two times step 10 to each tube with the same 50µl of EB buffer.
