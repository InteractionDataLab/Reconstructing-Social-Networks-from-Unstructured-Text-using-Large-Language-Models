All research was done by the students on our team.
Experiments were designed and conducted by Emilie Cuillery, Paola Malsot, Rocco Meli, Ari Sarfatis, Victor Steininger, Grégoire Thouvenin and Nina van Tiel in E. coli and by Joseph Heng, Vincent Jacquot, Cyril Pulver, Loïc Steiner and Axel Uran in S. cerevisiae. Shout out to Loïc Steiner for his amazing work in the lab (and his BBQ skills).
The initial idea for Bio LOGIC came from Ari Sarfatis.
The wiki was designed by Axel Uran. All team members contributed to the content of the wiki.
The establishment of the model of the project was done by Rocco Meli and Ari Sarfatis. The software implementation was done by Rocco Meli.
The Interlab study was conducted by Victor Steininger.
The Human Practices Article was written by Cyril Pulver. The interviews were done by Joseph Heng, Vincent Jacquot, Paola Malsot, Cyril Pulver, Loïc Steiner, Victor Steininger, Grégoire Thouvenin and Axel Uran.
The 'gymnase day' was mostly organized Vincent Jacquot and Victor Steininger, and all team members participated during the different activities.
The survey in Lausanne was done by Joseph Heng, Vincent Jacquot, Cyril Pulver, Victor Steininger, Grégoire Thouvenin. The survey in Basel with the team from Zurich Loïc Steiner and Victor Steininger.
Graphics were done by Emilie Cuillery.
Our advisors, Riccardo Dainese and Michael Frochaux, PhD students in Bart Deplancke's lab, and Ted Baldwin, Romane Breysse, Nikolaus Huwiler, Sakura Nussbaum and Cécile Piot, EPFL iGEM 2014 team members, helped us get started in the lab and were available to answer our questions and help us out during the project.
Our instructors, Bart Deplancke, Barbara Grisoni and Sebastian Maerkl, contributed support to help us solve some of the issues we encountered and go forward with our project, and showed us the path of scientific rigor.

Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge  all the help and support we received throughout our iGEM adventure and would like to thank everyone who helped in any possible way and together made our project possible.
General support
A warm thanks to EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, whithout which our participation in iGEM and our project would not have been possible. We would like to thank André Pexieder for letting us use his lab and its equipment during the project, Marie-France Radigois who helped us with the administrative tasks related to the project and Stéphane Karlen, Safety coordinator at the School of Life Science, who gave us a course on laboratory safety before our project started and was available for any question during the project.
Lab and project support
Special thanks to David Bikard, from the Institut Pasteur, for sending us E. Coli strains JEN202, JEN202+pWJ89 and DH5a+pWJ66, a central part for the wet lab in E. Coli. We would like to thank Andreas Mayer's lab from the University of Lausanne (UNIL) for giving us the strain of S. cerevisiae W303 for our experiments. We would like to thank Miguel Garcia who taught us the basics of flow cytometry and the EPFL Flow Cytometry Core Facility for letting us use their flow cytometer. Thanks to Andre Mozes and Loïc Tauzin for assisting us during our measurements. We would also like to thank Marc Chambon and Henrike Niederholtmeyer who taught us how to use the plate reader and Sebastian Maerkl for letting us use the plate reader in his lab. And thanks to Julie Russeil who helped us through our first successful yeast integration and gave us useful tips for working with yeast. Special thanks to Paolo De Los Rios, head of the Laboratory of Statistical Biophysics, for a very useful discussion on our model, his advice and constuctive inputs. Thanks to Sahar Hosseinian Ehrensberger for helping us with statistics concerning the Interlab study.
