PARTS
All the parts we used for our project were added to the iGEM registry catalog and documented to be available to everyone who wants to use it using the bioBrick assembly system
Our full collection
Have a look to our entire part collection containing all the biobricks we made.
BioBrick improvement
Three of our parts can be considered as optimization of already existing parts. Check the ameliorations we did.
Our best part
This part is a pillar of our project and we consider it as the best representative part of our work.
