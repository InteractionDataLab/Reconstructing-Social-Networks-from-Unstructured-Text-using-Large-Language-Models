The location it binds to may therefore be controlled by producing specific gRNAs.</P><P>By targeting dCas9 fused to a RNAP recruiting subunit (dCas9-ω) to an adequate distance from the transcription starting site (TSS),  J23117 (BBa_(LINK)) was <B>successfully induced</B>, which represents a PNP transistor in “<B>on</B>” state.</P><P>We chose to test two sites close enough to the TSS which when bound by dCas9-w are likely to sterically hinder RNA Polymerase (RNAP).  By itself, targeting dCas9-w to inhibition sites (<I>R1</I>, <I>R2</I>), sometimes resulted in slight activation (repeat (LINK)) and sometimes in slight inhibition (repeat (LINK)). This might be explained by the already low promoter strength of J23117 (close to autofluorescence in our measurements and consistent with the registry(LINK)) and the presence of the activating ω subunit on dCas9-ω. Overall, <I>R1</I>, <I>R2</I> and <I>R1/R2</I> produce fluorescence close to basal levels and the transistor is considered to be in “<B>off</B>” state.</P><P>Yet, when activation and inhibition sites are targeted simultaneously, dCas9-w bound to inhibition position <B>hinders induction</B> (A/R1, A/R2). We found out that A/R2 may virtually <B>suppress activation</B>; the promoter is in “<B>off</B>” state. Such an effect has been reported for S. cerevisiae (REF) but -to our knowledge- hadn’t been tested in E. coli.</P><P>The Relative Fluoescence Units (RFU) discrepancy between A/R1 and A/R2 could be explained by our modeling simulations (LINK). A/R2 produces an output consistent with predictions for a model where activation and inhibition sites may be bound by dCas9-w without steric hindrance between the dCas9-ws: binding is independent. A/R1 on the other hand behaves as if co-binding of the activation and inhibition sites were impossible. Interestingly, we notice that for A/R1 the activation and the inhibition sites are on the same strand, whereas in A/R2 the sites are a bit farther and on different strands. If you are interested, please take a look at the promoter modeling (LINK) page for a plausible explanation.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="mutability"><H2>Transistor Mutability: The promoter’s regulatory sites may be mutated while conserving its transistor behaviour</H2><P>We selected dCas9-w targets outside of the <I>-10</I> and <I>-35</I> regions on BBa_ and mutated them.

Nielsen (REF) has reported the use of mutated synthetic promoters between -35 and -10 regions to build regular dCas9 inhibition-logic circuits. Due to time constraints, we couldn’t produce “double” activation/inhibition inputs. The response of the mutated promoter for single gRNA input, however, suggests that it behaves similarly to the original promoter.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="orthogonality"><H2>Orthogonality : Transistors do not produce activation or inhibition patterns when the input gRNA is not complementary to their regulation sites</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.

This result is consistent with studies of dCas9’s specificity in the literature.</P><P>Unfortunately, we lacked time to test specific regulation of one transistor among several within the same cell.  Nevertheless, clues that multiple transistors  can work simultaneously can be found in the chaining experiment below, where two non-orthogonal promoters worked in conjunction. The <I>transistor response</I> experiment is also informative on the orthogonality of signals as two gRNA inputs seem to have worked in parallel to produce the A/R1 response (see above). Moreover, the model predicted that despite sharing the apo-dCas9 the gRNA inputs are still able to form a sufficient amount of gRNA-dCas9 complexes to work as expected (LINK)</P></SECTION><SECTION class="chainability"><H2>Chainability : One transistor can propagate signal to another transistor</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Error bars represent one standard deviation for n = 3 biological replicates.

We notice that the basal expression of the downstream reporter J23117_alt in chained configuration (B_d) is higher than the basal expression of regular J23117_alt (B_alt). This is probably due to leakage from the upstream promoter, as repressing the upstream promoter (R_u) resulted in lower fluorescent output.

We discovered that the response of the system seems completely independent of the concentration of aTc!</P><DIV class="col-md-5"><P>These two figures show the response of the transistor with different gRNAs:

                   </UL></P><P>The activation is clearly above the basal level (at the end of the measure, when the equilibrium tend to be reached, the ratio between activation and basal level is approximately 1:4). Furthermore, the activating gRNA induce a higher GFP expression as the inhibitory one (ratio 1:2 approximately). This difference is even bigger with both activation and inhibition. This could easily be explained: when inducing activation and inhibition, three gRNAs are expressed (c3_0, c6_0 and c7_0). It means that three dCas9 proteins are present in a region less than 100 base pair long. This will obviously cause steric inhibition and prevent the RNA Polymerase to bind the promoter (just go check our modeling page for the dCas9 shape and minimal binding distance).</P><P>The orthogonality showed good results as well! When targeting the CYC0 promoter with a different gRNA (the inhibitory gRNA for promoter CYC1 in this case), the fluorescence is not influenced. It means that the building of orthogonal circuits that don’t interfere with each other is possible and feasible!</P><P>Unfortunately, due to lack of time, some tests as the chainability, the mutability or the measure of a logic gate response were not feasible.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg outline"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:EPF_Lausanne/Design">Continue the tour!</A></BUTTON></CENTER><TITLE>EPFL 2015 iGEM bioLogic Logic Orthogonal gRNA Implemented Circuits</TITLE><FOOTER id="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 text-center"><H1>NOT PROOFREAD</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
