The location it binds to may therefore be controlled by producing specific gRNAs.</P><P>By targeting dCas9 fused to a RNAP recruiting subunit (dCas9-ω) to an adequate distance from the transcription starting site (TSS),  PAM-rich_J23117 (BBa_K1723001) was <B>successfully induced</B>, which represents a PNP transistor in “<B>on</B>” state.</P><P>The bio-transistor was designed to produce GFPmut2.

By itself, targeting dCas9-ω to inhibition sites (<I>R1</I>, <I>R2</I>), sometimes resulted in slight activation
        (experiment <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/f/fb/EPF_Lausanne_WZ_06.jpg">3</A>) and sometimes in slight inhibition (experiment <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/6/61/EPF_Lausanne_WZ_01.jpg">1</A>). This might be explained by the already low promoter strength of J23117 (close to autofluorescence in our measurements and consistent with the registry <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23117">BBa_J23117</A>) and the presence of the activating ω subunit on dCas9-ω.

We found out that A/R2 may virtually <B>suppress activation</B>; the promoter is in “<B>off</B>” state. Such an effect has been reported for S. cerevisiae (REF) but -to our knowledge- hadn’t been tested in E. coli.</P><P>RFU discrepancy between A/R1 and A/R2 could be explained by our modeling simulations. A/R2 produces an output consistent with predictions for a model where activation and inhibition sites may be bound by dCas9-w without steric hindrance between the dCas9-ws: binding is independent. A/R1 on the other hand behaves as if co-binding of the activation and inhibition sites were impossible. Interestingly, we notice that for A/R1 the activation and the inhibition sites are on the same strand, whereas in A/R2 the sites are a bit farther and on different strands.</P></SECTION><SECTION class="mutability"><H2>Transistor Mutability: The promoter’s regulatory sites may be mutated while conserving its transistor behaviour</H2><P>We selected dCas9-w targets outside of the <I>-10</I> and <I>-35</I> regions on BBa_ and mutated them.

      They are also very close to autofluorescence and basal levels; they are in the “off” state. In this particular experiment, basal levels were measured with cells
      lacking apo-dCas9-ω producing plasmids. This might explain the slight difference in RFU between basal configuration and non-specific gRNA + dCas9-ω constructs.
      This result is consistent with studies of dCas9’s specificity in the literature [3].</P><P>Unfortunately, we lacked time to test specific regulation of one transistor among several within the same cell.  Nevertheless, clues that multiple transistors  can work simultaneously can be found in the chaining experiment below, where two non-orthogonal promoters worked in conjunction. The <I>transistor response</I> experiment is also informative on the orthogonality of signals as two gRNA inputs seem to have worked in parallel to produce the <I>A/R1 response</I> (see above).
      Moreover, the model predicted that despite sharing the intracellular apo-dCas9 pool, the gRNA inputs are still able to form a sufficient amount of gRNA-dCas9 complexes to work as expected</P></SECTION><SECTION class="chainability"><H2>Chainability : One transistor can propagate signal to another transistor</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Measurement 16.

      than the RFUs, the normalised fluorescence result will decrease. This pattern was observed in all our kinetic experiments when bacteria were observed in log growth phase. In this
      particular experiment the time needed to tend toward equilibrium is slower than usual. In most measurements, the transistor stabilises faster (~ 300 min).</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Measurement 9.

        </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In this experiment, we used arabinose(ara)-inducible promoters to produce gRNA inputs. This measurement provides clues as to how the transistor responds with increasing signal strength.
      We notice that activation (A) is impacted by the input levels. On the other hand, in the inhibition condition the levels are already close to basal and [ara] has little effect on the transistor's
      output. Testing simultaneous activation and repression constructs should, however, provide more information of transitor modulability.
      The measurement of simultaneous activation and repression has been planned and should take place soon...

Furthermore, the activating gRNA induce a higher GFP expression as the inhibitory one (ratio 1:2 approximately). This difference is even bigger with both activation and inhibition. This could easily be explained: when inducing activation and inhibition, three gRNAs are expressed (c3_0, c6_0 and c7_0). It means that three dCas9 proteins are present in a region less than 100 base pair long. This will obviously cause steric inhibition and prevent the RNA Polymerase to bind the promoter (just go check our modeling page for the dCas9 shape and minimal binding distance).</P><P>The orthogonality showed good results as well! When targeting the CYC0 promoter with a different gRNA (the inhibitory gRNA for promoter CYC1 in this case), the fluorescence is not influenced. It means that the building of orthogonal circuits that don’t interfere with each other is possible and feasible!</P><P>Unfortunately, due to lack of time, some tests as the chainability, the mutability or the measure of a logic gate response were not feasible.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg outline"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:EPF_Lausanne/Design">Continue the tour!</A></BUTTON></CENTER><TITLE>EPFL 2015 iGEM bioLogic Logic Orthogonal gRNA Implemented Circuits</TITLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
