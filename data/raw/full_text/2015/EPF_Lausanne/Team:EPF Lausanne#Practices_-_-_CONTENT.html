This is especially true in Switzerland, where the system of direct democracy and referendums allow the population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. Research in synthetic biology could have come to an end had the 1998 federal popular initiative “for the protection of life and the environment against gene manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)” been accepted. Indeed, production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited [1].</P><P align="justify">Given the importance and relevance of this topic, we decided to investigate the issue of communication and interaction in the field of science. We began our investigation by attempting to identify the general public opinion before discussing this outlook with a panel of experts from different fields such as biology, ethics, politics, law, industry, religion and journalism. It quickly became obvious that the matters of communication and interaction raise extremely difficult questions, and we do not claim we have a final answer. Instead, we tried to highlight the different opinions we encountered during these interviews and help sketch the landscape of science communication in our country.</P><H3>The GMO stigma</H3><P align="justify">In order to assess how the general public perceives the field of synthetic biology, we designed a survey that we submitted to people passing by a stand we held in the streets of Lausanne. The <A href="#Survey" data-toggle="tab">survey</A> and its results can be found on the Human Pratcices page of our website. The first salient result of our survey was that people reacted very differently to the subject of synthetic biology depending on whether the acronym GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) was present or not in the question they were asked. While our survey stimulated the interest and the curiosity of the subjects as they were reading and answering the questions (many even asked about the veracity of past iGEM projects), this open-mindedness faded out when the word GMO came up. These two seemingly contradictory positions underline a big problem in the way people in general understand synthetic biology, in Switzerland at least. We mentioned it to Prof. Denis Duboule, geneticist and professor at EPFL: “These reactions are very interesting”, he says, “It pinpoints the fact that that the word GMO has become a stigma. This situation accurately reflects the repercussions of poor scientific communication. After all, people only read what is given to them”. “GMO is one of those buzzwords we hear too often without actually knowing what is meant, apart from their association with controversies and scandals” notes Aurélie Coulon, journalist for the Swiss daily newspaper <I>Le Temps</I>.  Indeed, several people spontaneously mentioned the scandals associated with the agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto. One of them even accused the United States of being “the greatest terrorists on the planet” concerning their use of GMOs. For Prof. Duboule, the problem stems from the often confusing debate in which GMOs are all tarred with the same brush “We have to distinguish political, ethical and scientific problems. […] If you ask me about GMOs from a scientific point of view, I can assure you: they are not dangerous. […] However, I am totally opposed to the policy of corporations that sell sterile seeds”, he adds as an illustration.</P><H3>Dreams and red flags</H3><P align="justify">Our goal was also to gauge the public’s reaction to the use of genetically modified organisms in various fields. We therefore asked passersby to give their point of view on a few examples of GMOs designed to be used in medicine, environment or agriculture (<A href="#Survey" data-toggle="tab">see our survey</A>). We purposefully introduced polemical uses of GMOs, such as the modification of human embryonic cells in order to cure genetic diseases. Surprisingly, the sole statement that collected a majority of negative reactions was related to agriculture, i.e the engineering of a wheat strain capable of adapting to climatic conditions. Agriculture seems to be the scapegoat of all synthetic biology’s excesses. Prof. Duboule suggests the following analysis: “Via association mechanisms, wheat and GMOs bring people back to sensitive issues such as nutrition, the challenge of third world development, overpopulation. […] Unlike the idea of conquering Mars, life sciences are not so evocative of dreams”.</P><H3>Managing transparency </H3><P align="justify">Unquestionably, it will be difficult if not impossible to free the word OGM from all the prejudices that now define it. This is an example of how the the scientific world was unable to successfully communicate with and inform the general public. In the light of this failure, how should the scientific community efficiently communicate with the outside world? What should be done to prevent an expression like “GMO” from drifting away from its original meaning? Transparency may be an answer. “We should make the system so transparent that people don’t even need to look into details. Trust is important!” claims Oliver Peter, head of the high-throughput screening group at <I>Actelion Pharmaceuticals</I>.</P><P align="justify">However, transparency also has downsides as it may nurture a form of scaremongering: communication must be managed with care.  We can take the very heated and publicized debate around the CRISPR-Cas9 protein as an example. This protein makes the editing of the genome quicker and cheaper than ever, thus opening new perspectives for genetic manipulations applied to animals, and ultimately humans. This technical breakthrough has had the side effect of shining the spotlight  on  the very fundamental issue of what is acceptable or not when it comes to manipulating our genes at will as well as the risks involved in trying to do it. When using the CRISPR technology, one of the important technical difficulties is the presence “off-target effects” that can lead the protein to cut in an unwanted spot in the genome. The imprecision of the technology could have dramatic consequences if used in a medical environment. However, we can hypothesize that an overly alarmist media coverage of these “off target effects” could lead the general opinion to be definitely opposed to any further research concerning CRISPR-Cas9, especially future therapeutic applications. From this assumption, a solution would be to not even be discussing those “off target effects” until they are resolved by the researchers. “Managing transparency is a work the scientist could do and would be a lot more productive than not saying things, or exposing extreme points of view in order to tame the public’s concerns” claims Prof. Gaia Barazzetti, ethicist specialized in bioethics. “I believe  that publicly speaking about risks - if scientists ever agree on a way to do it - could be a good opportunity to build trust with the general public”, she continues, stressing that a constant race for spectacular innovation is not the only way forward in science. Time should be taken to talk about risks and how to reduce them, she adds. Conversely, according to Prof. Duboule, public exposure of the current technical issues encountered by a technology such as Cas9 tends to move the debate away from the really important questions. “For me, those [off target effects] are secondary problems that will be solved in the coming decades. The real question is: how will we apply this technology?”</P><P align="justify">The desire for a constant and transparent flow of information is certainly praiseworthy, but how exactly could it be achieved? Traditional media such as newspapers, radio and television can participate in this process, but they tend to focus on science only in the case of significant scientific breakthroughs or important scientific fraud and polemics, as they need to stay entertaining and relevant for their respective audience. “There is unfortunately no room  in mainstream media to talk about science and the actual process of research: how research works, where the money comes from, how papers are reviewed and published”, regrets Aurélie Coulon,  “Such subjects only show little interest to the Editor-In-Chief, except in the case of a great fraud. Therefore, the reader never gets the keys to understand shocking news. […] As a journalist, I try to describe the methodology and to explain the words again, those that look simple in particular. But all this is definitely not easy in a one-way communication context”.</P><H3>Breaking the one-way interaction model</H3><P align="justify">The remark about the existence of a “one-way communication context” leads to the issue of the interaction between scientists and the general public. Does such an interaction really exist? We asked the public about during our <A href="#Survey" data-toggle="tab">survey</A> in Lausanne, and the answer was mostly negative. “Science should be discussed more often in the street, with the public” or “Scientists should make an effort” were recurring comments. Despite this perception of lack of communication, the media coverage of science in Western Switzerland seems adequate according to Prof. Didier Trono, researcher at EPFL and former Dean of the Faculty of Life Sciences: “I believe that a lot of effort is made in order inform the general public”, he told us, furthermore underlining the large offer of media content available in the region, including daily national radio shows and weekly TV shows. Not only national media, but also private media such as newspapers regularly talk about science and related social concerns, he adds. “It can be better”, Prof. Trono conceded, “You should never miss an opportunity to go and inform the people. We could be more imaginative in the programs we design for schools and for the public in general”.</P><P align="justify">Despite the variety and abundance of information available for the general public, the overall feeling that interaction is insufficient remains .This may be due to the fact that information alone is not sufficient to create interaction, as it only goes one way. A less top-down way of informing the public could be found in more participative methods. The University of Lausanne for instance provides to the public an open-access lab called “L’Éprouvette” (French for “The Test Tube”) [2]. In parallel, they offer introductions to scientific research with both practical experiments and discussions about the issues around Science. Other examples are the DIY biohacker spaces that are burgeoning outside institutions, such as the “Hackuarium”, a Lausanne-based bio-hacker community with which last year’s EPFL iGEM team collaborated [3].</P><P align="justify">If communication and more importantly interaction between scientists and the general public appears to be essential, another big question comes to the mind: which stance should the scientist adopt in the discussion process? Do his competences give him authority to stand above the general public? Prof. Trono insists:  “We [scientists] have to constantly be discussing with the public. However we must not present ourselves as those who know everything, compared to the uneducated crowd that awaits for a magic kit that works by simply pushing a few buttons”. Such position requires the scientist to step  back from his everyday research and from his own interests in order to get an overall view of the situation, which, as Prof François Lefort, biologist and member of the Parliament of the State of Geneva  underlines, is not easy: “One must bear in mind that a scientist does not only work to discover things, even if that is exciting [...]”, he told us, “But he then has to take the necessary time to understand  and reflect upon his discovery, to realize whether it is dangerous or not. It is not only philosophical, but very human. [...] It is a matter of survival”.</P><P align="justify">We also asked Prof. Lazare Benaroyo, ethicist and researcher at the University of Lausanne, about the position of the scientist in the information process. “I believe that interacting with the public and participating in the information process is part of the scientist’s responsibility”, he says, “It is a central matter. We hear people say: yes of course, we have to inform people because we have to respect their will, and for them to express it, they have to be informed. The problem is that when we are informing, we are already giving our own vision of things. So is it really an information?”. This analysis brings up another issue: scientists do not learn how to discuss their field of research with the general public and other experts such as humanities specialists. “It has to be taught to researchers during their training”, Prof. Benaroyo affirms, “A researcher has to be able to step back and question his own work”.</P><H3>Responsibility</H3><P align="justify">Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 has generated a heated debate on the way it could be used in gene therapy, which has led us to investigate the issue of the responsibility of the outcomes of scientific research. We asked the public in Lausanne about it, and the <A href="#Survey" data-toggle="tab">main answer</A> was neither “the people” nor “politicians”, but by a great margin: “scientists”. Oliver Peter totally agrees with this answer: “That’s very clear and very easy: it’s you [scientists, who are responsible]! You and your conscience. You can never delegate an ethical decision to a committee, to your boss or anyone else for that matter. In the end, if you do not feel good about it, you must not do it, even if people disagree with you”. This, of course, is one way to see the problem. But it creates a paradox: on one side, people ask for more interaction with scientists and on the other side, they fully delegate the responsibility of research to the scientific experts. “It is a very complicated question, and you are talking about the crux of the matter. We do not really know who has to debate. Of course, society, because those are ethics problems that affect it as a whole”, Prof. Duboule says.</P><P align="justify">How can society as a whole be represented for such a debate? “Scientists have to shed some lights using their knowledge in order to clarify what was not properly understood”, Prof. Trono suggests.  “We need ethicists who think deeply on social repercussions of research. However, the general public also has the role to be well informed, and not indoctrinated. It is a societal dialogue, and this role is claimed by ethics committees – I’m thinking about the National Academy of Sciences in the USA for instance – that aim to represent society as a whole”. Prof. Trono was not the only one to mention ethics committees. “There are national ethics committees consisting of scientists, politicians, and sometimes philosophers in each country. Judgment has to come from there, if those committees are reliable of course. But you, as a scientist, have to wonder about your own project. The first defence line is people [scientists] like you”, Prof. Lefort insists.</P><P align="justify">Another way the media address the matter of responsibility in Science is by invoking “playing God”, a very strong symbol (which goes back to the polemical way some media cover scientific topics), and can be understood as “not respecting what God gave us by modifying the genome”. Xavier Gavend, theologist and chaplain at EPFL gave us another view on this subject by invoking the great importance of humility (which Prof. Benaroyo also mentioned as being a necessary quality for a scientist): “From a Christian perspective, it is with humility that greatness can be achieved. That is the whole paradox: we are responsible, we are in charge, but we are not Gods ourselves. We do not want to make ourselves Gods”. According to Xavier Gavend, the responsibility stemming from research might be too much for a human being to bear.</P><H3>Moratoriums, necessary safeguards or obstacles?</H3><P align="justify">Another way to discuss a breakthrough technology, how it should or should not be used, consists in declaring a moratorium, meaning that all research involving the specific technology is interrupted until a general agreement is found between researchers and all other stakeholders. A well-known example of such approach occurred in 1975 when a moratorium concerning genetic manipulation took place in Asilomar. Earlier this year a group of scientists who participated in the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 called for a worldwide voluntary moratorium in order to discuss the ethical consequences of being able to easily edit and modify the human genome in an inheritable way [4]. </P><P align="justify">Of all the topics covered with the experts, moratorium is the one that caused the most contrasted reactions. We encountered three different points of view on the subject. Some specialists insisted on the necessity of moratoriums, as they allow scientists to avoid making disastrous mistakes in the future and keep working in line with ethics: “I think that the word of caution made by these scientists matches with a broad consensus in the scientific community: we do not wish to modify the human germline in any way”, Prof. Trono affirms, also reminding us that the question of human genome manipulation is not a new one. Jean-Christophe Méroz, member of the legislation division at Swissmedic, emphasized that a moratorium on clinical applications of a technology is not to be confused with a moratorium on the technology itself. “This is my personal opinion”, he precises, “I’d say yes to a moratorium on any research applied to humans (like the one Prof. Jennifer Doudna called for). But let’s keep on doing our research on cells and animals to verify how precisely we can master this technology. [...] A moratorium should avoid future interruptions of preclinical research”. Méroz also made clear the regulatory assessment of the risks of a potential clinical treatment and ethical debates are two totally different things that should not be mixed up nor lead by the same institutions. Prof. Duboule also expressed concerns about fully stopping the research because of a moratorium, as it would represent a waste of time, above all for sick people waiting for a treatment (patients suffering from cystic fibrosis for example). In addition, moratoriums are, in his opinion, not the right way to address important questions. A third opinion, supported by Oliver Peter, assesses that the debate raised by CRISPR-Cas9 does not bring anything really new to the table compared with the Asilomar moratorium: “I do not think it [a moratorium] is necessary. For me, this technology is making things more feasible, but we have already debated this. And we already decided in our society that we do not want to interfere with the human germ line. There is nothing fundamentally new that one can do with CRISPR-Cas9 as far as I understand it”.</P><H3>The role of Ethics</H3><P align="justify">A topic that is often mentioned in discussions about moratoriums is the position and the role of ethics in the discussion. Recently, in the shadows of the very mediatized debate around CRISPR-Cas9 and the use of genetic engineering in medicine, ethics and bioethicists in particular have been described as a barrier to progress. An example is the editorial Steven Pinker wrote for the Boston Globe: “The moral imperative for bioethics” published on August 1st 2015 [5]. We also noted a tendency for scientists to expect ethicists to give clear answers to questions like “are we allowed to continue doing such or such experiment?” which is in fact a misconception about the function of ethics in such issues. Prof. Benaroyo makes it clear: “Ethics in itself will usually not give an answer as a matter of principle, ethics is reflexive, meaning that it will ask the questions and explore the issues”. Most importantly, ethics and ethics committees are not to be confused. Ethics committees are not and must not solely consist of ethicists. All stakeholders have to be represented. Typically, for a public health issue, it would mean scientists, members of an association representing patients, ethicists, sociologists, politicians and economists. The role of ethics committees is to make assessments, after having addressed the issues in a protocolar way, but not to lead a public debate between different parties.</P><H3>A few final words</H3><P align="justify">It seems very difficult for us to give any definite answer to the questions we asked about communication, interaction and responsibility in Science. Therefore, we decided to describe our general feeling after having met the experts and discussed the above-mentioned topics. It now appears essential to us that future scientists should be taught how to discuss their work, how to share it with other experts as well as the general public in an interactive way. Also, some form of self-questioning should always be entertained by the scientist as he/she is working, as captivating as his/her work can be. This should also include an open mindedness to criticism coming from experts in other fields such as humanities. From our point of view, the scientist should not be the only one able to foresee the consequences of his/her research. Though “ignorance of the law is no excuse”, setting up courses about the current state of legislation in the fields of research that young scientists will be exploring could help them put things into perspective. In a few words, it is all about making Science a little less about technicalities and a little more about social awareness.</P><H3>References and useful links:</H3><P align="justify">[1] Federal popular initiative “for the protection of life and the environment against genetic manipulations (initiative for genetic protection)” (in french): https://www.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/vi/vis240t.html</P><P align="justify">[2] Website of the open access lab “L’Éprouvette”: http://wp.unil.ch/mediationscientifique/activites/eprouvette/</P><P align="justify">[3] Collaboration between the 2014 EPFL iGEM team and the bio-hacker space “Hackuarium”: https://2014.igem.org/Team:EPF_Lausanne/HumanPractice</P><P align="justify">[4] A prudent path forward for genomic engineering and germline gene modification (2015), Science, http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6230/36</P></DIV><DIV id="Highschool" class="tab-pane fade"><H3>Highschool students' visit</H3><H4>Start of the day</H4><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Since iGEM is encouraging young students to get into the lab and engage in innovative ideas using synthetic biology, our aim for this day was to get this mindset across to highschool students.

This enabled us to introduce synthetic biology to interested laymen. More importantly, it allowed us to identify the preconceptions people have about the scientific community.  Such viewpoints are not those we are often confronted with as scientific students. We also asked the young students that came to our highschool day to fill out the survey. Here is a summary of the survey and an analysis of the most interesting results. Results are plotted in absolute numbers of answers.</I></P><H3>Public survey in Lausanne</H3><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P>On a sunny August morning, we held a stand in the Rue Haldimand of our beautiful town of Lausanne. Passerby came and went as they walked to and from the nearby market. Many of them were intrigued by our poster that asked “What is synthetic biology ? Give us your opinion !”. We submitted them our survey and took the opportunity to answer questions about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Over fifty people stopped by and talking with them was very enlightening !</P><P>We began by asking the subject whether he/she had ever heard about synthetic biology. If the answer was no, we provided him/her with the following Wikipedia definition: “Synthetic biology is a scientific field combining biology and engineering in order to  design and build (synthesize) new biologic systems and units”. Note that the definition does not mention the word GMO. This has its importance later on. The first answers we collected showed us that the term synthetic biology is mostly unheard of, though it mostly conveys a positive impression (see below).</P><P><I>Note: the following results are plotted in absolute number of answers</I></P><P>We then asked the subject whether this definition gave him/her a rather positive or negative feeling about synthetic biology. The answers were enthusiastic, with a vast majority of “rather positive”.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P>&gt;One of the striking results of this survey came from one of the last questions of our survey: “What is your opinion on GMOs (or Genetically Modified Organisms)?”, to which we mostly got “Rather negative” as an answer.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P>We thought it was interesting to compare the results of these two diagrams, as they seem to reflect the misconception people have about the word GMO. We discussed these results with the experts we interviewed: you can read about it in our main article.</P><P>The next thing we wanted to know was whether or not the subject felt that the interaction between the scientific world and the general public was satisfactory. The answers we obtained clearly show that people believe is not the case.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P> We then asked passerbys whom they believed should take responsibility for the outcomes of scientific research, and control the use of derived technology. The subject could choose several answers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P>We were quite surprised by these results, as in Switzerland, direct democracy and referendums allow the entire population to vote on very specific questions, scientific topics included. Research in synthetic biology could have come to an abrupt end had the 1998 had the federal popular initiative - “for the protection of life and the environment against genetic manipulation (initiative for genetic protection)” - been accepted. Indeed, the production, acquisition and handing-over of any genetically modified animal would have been prohibited. From our perspective, seeing the people delegate all responsibilities to researchers is the consequence of a lack of interaction. This subject is further explored in our main article.</P><P>In the next part of our survey, we quickly described the purpose of the iGEM competition, and presented the main idea behind our project (building independent transistors in cells). We then introduced examples of organisms that could be designed using our project and other synthetic biology applications. Some were past iGEM projects, some we imagined ourselves. Our examples covered a variety of different domains such as energy, agriculture, medicine and information processing (see list below).

This result further underlines the broad misconception surrounding the acronym GMO.</P><P>We also tried to pinpoint which applications of synthetic biology worry the general public. We asked the subject to pick his/her main concerns among the following list: ethics, environment, social, national security, religion and health. Several answers were allowed. The most chosen answer was “environment”. Again, we can observe this association between synthetic biology and environment. “Ethics” trailed by a few answers.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8"><P>One result we found interesting was the relatively low number of ‘National security’ answers. Although Switzerland is a neutral country, it spends a considerable amount of its GDP (0.8% in 2012) for military expenses [1] and is one of the only countries in Europe to maintain a compulsory military service. We tried to contact the Swiss military but they declined to answer.</P><P>We also asked the school chaplains to comment on the lack of religious concerns despite Switzerland's deeply religious history. According to them, this can be explained by sociology. In recent years Switzerland, has seen a large emancipation movement from religions: &quot;few people define themselves as religious, but this does not mean that they have an ethical reflection&quot; comments Christian Vez, protestant school chaplain. &quot;Today it is not religion that governs a country, we are in a plural regime’ says Xavier Gravend, catholic school chaplain.  ‘We are dealing with these issues together under the banner of ethics, which is healthier than giving this responsibility to the religious world&quot;. He adds that &quot;secularism is a chance; it gives everyone the opportunity to express their opinion, including religions&quot;.</P><P>At the end of survey we included a question from the ETHZ iGEM team. This questions sought to determine whether sensitivity or specificity was most important in cancer diagnosis. The results showed mixed feelings, and many people took some time to think before answering.</P><P>The themes developed in this analysis are further discussed in our main article.</P><H3>Main results from Basel public survey and Vaud highschools students</H3><P>As mentioned above, we also submitted the survey to passerbys in Basel (in collaboration with the ETHZ iGEM team) and to Vaud highschool students (following the “biology and chemistry” option) before they visited us for the Highschool day. We collected about twenty forms in Basel and fifty from the students. Because the target audience was different in each of the three surveys, we decided not to combine the data, but rather to compare it for questions where opinions varied the most. All results are plotted in percentages. Results from Basel are to be interpreted with care because of the small number of answers.</P><P>While the proportion of positive answers to the question “Does a sufficient interaction exist between the general public and scientists?” from Lausanne and Basel was very similar (around 25% of positive answers), highschool students were more categorical (less than ten percent of positive answers).This encouraged us to further investigate the issue of interaction in scientific research in our main article.</P><P>Since we believed to have observed a link between the question “Are you favourable to engineered wheat strains that easily adapt to climatic conditions ?” and the one asking “What is your opinion on GMOs ?” during our public survey in Lausanne, we decided to compare the overall answers to the two questions. The results from Basel and Lausanne underline the unpopularity of the acronym GMO. Opinions are more nuanced among highchool students, with half of them being favorable to the modified wheat strain. In addition, a majority of them were favorable to the use of GMOs, which was neither the case for the general public in Lausanne nor in Basel. An possible explanation to this discrepancy is the students' background in biology and chemistry students. However, we have to mention that many students left a comment next to the answer of the second question, stating that using GMOs requires caution both on a technical and economic level.</P><P>The collected opinions concerning the practical examples of organisms designed with synthetic biology were especially different among the three audiences we surveyed for the 3 applications seen below. While favorable opinions on “Bacterium that produces plastic”, “A minesweeper game made with bacteria” and the “Piece of art made with multicolored bacteria” were all above the fifty percent mark in Basel and Lausanne, the same ideas did not seduce the students. Their lack of enthusiasm with respect to the minesweeper game reminded us that we were 90s kids...</P><P>Our first conclusion to this series of surveys, is that there is a clear feeling among the general public that interaction between them and scientists is insufficient. We also noted the unpopularity of the word “GMO”, which contrats with the popularity of synthetic biology and most of its applications.
        We discussed these main findings (along with the other results) with various specialists in our main article : Interaction and Communication in Scientific Research</P></DIV></DIV><H3>References</H3><P>[1] Stockholm international peace research institute, http://portal.sipri.org/publications/pages/expenditures/country-search (18.09.2015)</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg outline"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:EPF_Lausanne/Team/Meet">Continue the tour!</A></BUTTON></CENTER><TITLE>EPFL 2015 iGEM bioLogic Logic Orthogonal gRNA Implemented Circuits</TITLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
