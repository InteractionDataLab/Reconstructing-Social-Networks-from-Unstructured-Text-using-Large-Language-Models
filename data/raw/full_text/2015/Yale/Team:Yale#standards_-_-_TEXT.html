Improve Function of Existing BioBrick: Characterized BBa_J23114 in BBa_K1856002 , BBa_J23111 in BBa_K1856003 , BBa_J23100 in BBa_K1856004 , and BBa_K180000 in BBa_K1856005 . The promoters were characterized by assembling them in front of a citrine gene. The combination was submitted as new biobricks. The system is designed such that the biobrick can be transformed into any non-model organism as test the efficacy of the promoter within that organism.
Help Any Other Team: Successfully Finished and Then Some!  Please look at our collaborations page to see how the Yale iGEM team helped establish an information sharing pipeline for teams working in non-model organisms.  We then used this pipeline to share information about our experience to over five other University teams while learning from their experience as well.  This pipeline also allowed the Yale iGEM team to distribute a survey which allowed us to gather information about other University's experiences of, complications with, and advice for working with non model organisms that will hopefully be priceless for future iGEM teams that hope to deal with non-model organisms.
Outreach specific to your project: Successfully Finished!  We set up a public presentation at Yale's Center for Engineering Innovation and Design in order to address the ethical considerations of synthetic biology and counter misinformation that leads to public paranoia over synthetic biology.  In order to do this, we constructed a presentation covering the ethics and consequences of genetically modifying environmentally important organisms such as crops and cyanobacteria.  To cover as many subjects as we could, we discussed the consequences of GMOS, the possible effects of a genetically modified strain of cyanobacteria escaping to the environment, and current methods used to prevent this issue from occurring.  After presenting our information, our team members moderated a discussion covering the subject.

Validate Bricks: Successfully finished!  Please look at part #??? in our parts section! In the parts section should be detailed information on how each of the seven promoter-citrine construct BioBricks effectively produce citrine when ported into an organism that has the machinery required for each promoter.
Submit Parts: Successfully finished! Please look at part #???? in our parts section! Along with the lac-citrine construct detailed in the bronze section below, our team also constructed six more promoter-citrine constructs.  Once spliced into your chosen shuttle vector and transformed into your non model organism, these constructs allow for easy testing.  If citrine is produced in your non model organism, your organism contains the machinery necessary to promote transcription with the chosen promoter!  If no citrine is produced, then the chosen operator does not cause transcription in your organism.  Please look at the linked section for more details.  Also, we were able to construct three BioBricks, each containing a different recombinase gene.  While these BioBricks were not experimentally validated, they should lead to the production of recombinase proteins that may help increase the efficiency of MAGE in various non-model organisms!
Human Practices: Successfully finished!  Please look at our our practices section! In order to spread greater knowledge of synthetic biology, our iGEM team hosted a talk at the Summer Science Research Institute (SSRI), a summer program for high school students interested in the sciences.  At this talk, three of our team members covered the basic history of synthetic biology, common techniques of synthetic biology, common uses of this field of research in industry, and, finally, covered our own research as a specific case study of synthetic biology research.  Finally, the Yale iGEM team also constructed a survey built to collect information on LGBTQ members of the science community.  This survey brought back information that may be extremely useful in helping the scientific community progress into a more egalitarian society.
