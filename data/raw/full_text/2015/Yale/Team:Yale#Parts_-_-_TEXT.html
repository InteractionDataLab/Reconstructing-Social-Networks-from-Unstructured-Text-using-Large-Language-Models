These are our legos.
Full Molecule Part One Part Two
Our collection of submitted biobricks consists of:
Mussel foot protein (MFP) 1-5-1 sequence [combination of Mytilus galloprovincialis Foot Protein 5 (Mgfp-5) and Mytilus li Edulis Foot Protein 1 (Mefp-1)].
MFP with superfolder Green Fluorescence Protein (sfGFP).
MFP with our anti-microbial peptide, LL-37.
Entire construct of our anti-microbial adhesive peptide: 2XStrep_Flagtag--LL-37--Mussel Foot Protein--sfGFP.

Testing Promoters
The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein-linked to superfolder GFP for localization. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and the antimicrobial domain is designed to interact with microbial membranes and interfere with membrane stability. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine supressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence supressing LL-37 antimicrobial action.

Harvesting Oysters
The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein-linked to superfolder GFP for localization. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and superfolder GFP will allow for florescence imaging and localization. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine supressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence supressing LL-37 antimicrobial action.
