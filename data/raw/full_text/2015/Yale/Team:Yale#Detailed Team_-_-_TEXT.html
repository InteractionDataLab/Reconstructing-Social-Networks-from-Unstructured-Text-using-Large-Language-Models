Danny is a Computer Science major in the class of 2018.  His hometown is Rye, NY.  In the team, he primarily works on developing software, the cyanobacteria project, and literature research.  He has no clue what he wants to do with his life, but enjoys synthetic biology research.  He once sang lead vocals in a progressive metal band. He can be reached at daniel.keller[at]yale.edu.
Erin
Erin is a sophomore from Rochester, New York majoring in Anthropology. She spends her time in the lab working on exonuclease and ligation-free cloning (ELIC), designing the wiki, and playing "Toxic" for her bacteria. After college, she hopes to go to medical school and find a career that combines public health and mindfulness. You can usually find her in the kitchen or in the WYBC broadcast studio. She can be reached at erin.wang[at]yale.edu.
Holly
Originally from Southern California, Holly is a freshman in Silliman College who plans on majoring in Biomedical Engineering. She is a wet lab researcher who focuses on engineering Rhizobia. Â After graduation and graduate school, she hopes to do volunteer work abroad in public health and contribute to the improvement of organ transplant systems. While in the East Coast, she enjoys googling images of In-N-Out burgers when she is hungry. She can be reached at holly.zhou[at]yale.edu.
Jessica
Jessica is a rising sophomore in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.
Lionel
Lionel is a sophomore looking to major in Molecular Biology and Computer Science. He grew up in Singapore, where he served as an infantry officer before starting college. Lionel hopes to combine his interest in science and in entrepreneurship, and he has had "great fun" working with friends on the wet lab team to engineer rhizobium. He can be reached at chentian.jin[at]yale.edu
Ariel
Natalie
Natalie is a fifth year doctoral student in the Isaacs Lab and currently the lead graduate mentor for the iGEM team. When she is not mentoring iGEM students, her research explores emergent properties of organisms with altered genetic codes. For the final few hours of the week not dedicated to iGEM and her research, Natalie can be found cooking or baking (with a particular emphasis on replicating or modifying recipes from www.smittenkitchen.com and www.seriouseats.com), or foraging for wild food and mushrooms. She can be reached at natalie.ma[at]yale.edu.
