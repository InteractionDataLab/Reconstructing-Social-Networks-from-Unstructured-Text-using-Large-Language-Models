New Biobricks Improved Biobricks
Our collection of submitted biobricks consists of:
New Biobricks
Promoter-Citrine-T7 Terminator Constructs
BBa_K1856000
BacA-citrine construct. Leaky expression observed in E. coli. Successfully transformed into rhizobium. Sequencing confirmed
Part 1: LL-37-MFP:
Based on BBa_K1396000
Feeding Fish
The part is an coding sequence for an anti-microbial peptides linked to a mussel-foot protein. The mussel foot protein will anneal to surfaces as a wet glue and the antimicrobial domain is designed to interact with microbial membranes and interfere with membrane stability. In order to use this part you can produce it in a TAG recoded organism simultaneously expressing a Tyrosine suppressor or L-DOPA orthogonal translational system. In order to purify you can use the 2X Strep tag and strep column and later cleave with enterokinase to remove the sequence suppressing LL-37 antimicrobial action. This is an improvement on the Utah State biobrick BBa_K1162006 which consists of only the LL-37 peptide.tion. This is an improvement on the Utah State biobrick BBa_K1162006 which consists of only the LL-37 peptide.
