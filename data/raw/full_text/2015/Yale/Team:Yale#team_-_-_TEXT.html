Alex
Alex Buhimschi
alexandru.buhimschi@yale.edu
Alex Buhimschi is a junior from Columbus, Ohio majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. He is very interested in research for clinical applications and hopes one day to become a physician scientist. In addition to iGEM, he is involved with the Elmseed Enterprise Fund, which consults for small businesses in New Haven. In his free time he enjoys collecting records and thinking about cells.

Ariel
Ariel Hernandez-Leyva
ariel.hernandez-leyva@yale.edu
Ariel is a senior majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Currently, he serves as the research coordinator and undergraduate advisor for iGEM. He hopes to have a future as physician scientist, studying human gut microbiota and engineering patients' bacteria to treat their bodies. He is a semi-professional juggler and is often seen juggling fruit in grocery stores.

Ed
Edward Kong
edward.kong@yale.edu
Ed is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Economics. He hopes to become a physician-researcher and study ways that the healthcare system can do better by patients from an economics standpoint. Ed spends most of his time outside of iGEM practicing on the Yale fencing team. En garde.

Acknowledgments
Project Support and Advice
All iGEM team members, as well as advisors Natalie Ma, Dr.Farren Isaacs, and Dr. Stephen Dellaporta, participated in the formation of the idea for this project and the research required to design and carry out this work
Project Advisor Support
Dr. Farren Isaacs and Dr. Stephen Dellaporta were the official advisors for our project--they helped us troubleshoot our setbacks and guided fundraising efforts.
Lab Support
Ben Akhuetie-Oni, Edward Barbieri, Ryan Gallagher, Adrian Haimovich, Paul Muir, Jaymin Patel, Corey Perez (Yale Crawford Lab), and Ariel Hernandez.Leyva helped with running lab experiments as well as lending resources. Natalie Ma, in addition to aiding with experiments, was also instrumental in keeping the team on track by helping us set daily and weekly goals.
Cyanobacteria Support
The Jordan Peccia Lab at Yale University provided us with the UTEX 2973 cyanobacteria strain and gave us advice on growing and culturing cyanobacteria.
Rhizobia Support
The Handelsman Lab and the Jacobs-Wagner Lab at Yale University provided us with the Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 strains 356, 370, and 371, respectively.
Web Design & Development
Colin Hemez and Cameron Yick designed the website, and Cameron implemented the designs. Colin also designed the team "Tree" logo.
Administration
Amy Mulholland and Natalie Ma helped us arrange meetings with our PIs as well as order lab equipment and experiment materials.
