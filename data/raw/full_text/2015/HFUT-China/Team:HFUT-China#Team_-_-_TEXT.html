Ron Duan - Developer
I'm Duan Rong,from HFUT in China.Coding can help me to relax.In my team, I'm a algorithm engineer. I design some algorithm to deal other teams' abstract and help my team to show you a beautiful data picture. In fact,  there are so many teams' abstract,obviously, I didn't read all of them. My friends and I read some and tagged some key words. Next, I wrote a program to learn what we did and computer help us to finish all of the abstract.The result is good enough.You will find computer is amazing!
