                We invited iGEMers from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) to have a discussion about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM experience. The two teams USTC-CHINA and USTC-Software firstly presented their work and then we introduced our projects. Through the presentation, we shared ideas and experience with each other. The USTC-CHINA team shared their experience of designing their biobrick, which enhanced our knowledge of synthetic biology. The USTC-Software team shared their idea of how software can assist SynBio researchers. Our team discussed our thoughts of which function synthetic biology researchers might need. More importantly, we both proposed some useful suggestions for each otherâ€™s project. With those suggestions, we both can improve our project, and also, we enjoyed the fun of being an iGEMer.

This conference includes more than 30 participants. In this conference, all teams share their projects and exchange ideas. We also make a presentation to show our project, BioDesigner. Lots of teams provides valuable suggestions for our project. Also, OUC-China propose to have a collaboration with us due to their demand of a automative Biology reaction simulator. Other teams also willing to use BioDesigner due to its amazing features. By attending this conference, we got communications with lots of teams. Here we express our sincere thanks for them.

They showed great interest in solving the problems in Synthetic Biology with computer science technology. This is indeed what we expect, to share iGEM spirit. We made a comprehensive introduction to the students from the background and practical application of synthetic biology. Then, team members show last year gold medal works.

                    iGEM competition has hold for lots of years, and there are lots stander parts accumulated. But there parts that have some problems in real biology experiments. So in order to provide SynBio researchers have a rough view of a part, we give parts a evaluation. By using DNA alignment tool BLAST provided by NCBI, we align parts with stander Nucleotide database, get a score for each part and then normalize the scores. We hope that this score can be a useful evaluation and help researchers to choose parts.
