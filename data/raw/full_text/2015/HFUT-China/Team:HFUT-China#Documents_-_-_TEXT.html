Input: contentType - that need to save in the folder
Output: basePath-new folder path
Test Use Case:
Use Case ID
Test Target
ContentType
Expectation Result
Finial Result
Accept
1
get correct path when contentType is none
None
/../downloads/2015/8/6/
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects
YES
2
get correct path when contentType is ""
""
/../downloads/2015/8/6/

YES
3
if directory was exist and contentType are correct , new folder wouldn't cover the old directory.
'image'
don't cover
don't cover
YES

API
design.recommend module ¶
implement recommend for parts
@author: Bowen, Ray, Yu
design.recommend.getApriorRecommend(chainStr, funcStr=None) [source] ¶
get recommendations with aprior algorithm
@param chainStr: part chain @type chainStr: str @return : recommendations @rytpe: dict
design.recommend.getMarkovRecommend(part_id) [source] ¶
get recommendations with Markov algorithm
@param part_id: part id @type part_id: str @return : recommendations @rytpe: dict
design.recommend.getPartNameAndType(part_id) [source] ¶
design.recommend.getResult(currentList, dataList) [source] ¶
design.recommend.get_chain(elem, num, process) [source] ¶
get chain which had predicted
according to information in process, get the chain from first element to elem variable and save the chain in a list
args:
elem: the last element in chain num: the line number in process process: a variable record the predict process
return:
a chain from first to elem variable
design.recommend.predict(m, count, s, A) [source] ¶
predict the chain after s
calculate the probability of a m-length chain, then return chains. CAUTION the number of chains maybe less then count
args:
m: the length of predict chain count: the number of predict chain s: the last element of the current chain A: transition matrix
return:
some chains save in list
