What is BioDesigner
BioDesigner is a smart assistant tool for Synthetic Biology design. Helping Synthetic Biologists to make creative products is BioDesigner's purpose. With this idea, BioDesigner presents all valuable information to users. Also by improving BioBricks’ searching process, recommending practical BioBricks during the design process, and simulating Biobricks’ reaction process, BioDesigner leads Synthetic Biology design to a new level.
Search
Search BioBricks, but more than BioBricks
Searching for a part is the most fundamental step in Synthetic Biology. With BioDesigner's powerful search tool, users can search parts by typing what they want, and the custom-built result will be presented to them. Besides, what BioDesigner can do is more than that. Lots of valuable information will also be presented to users, like basic information, especially parts quality evaluation score, as well as parts' related papers. By integrating lots of information together, users can get more than a BioBrick.
Recommendation
Select in selection, not Search in ocean
Selecting a part from tons of candidates is always a pain point to every Synthetic Biology researcher. BioDesigner is the assistant that can simplify this task. Based on users' current design, BioDesigner can narrow down the scope and provide useful parts as a recommendation to users. Also, by analyzing part's function, the recommendation will adjust to users’ design according to users’ specific function need. BioDesigner can also providing system level recommendation by showing users the relations between various proteins and genes. With BioDesigner’s fantastic recommendation function, selecting a part won't be that hard.
Simulation
Tell how it works, before you do your works
Traditionally, testing a Synthetic Biology design is done by lots of biological experiments, which can be an extremely time-consuming process. By using SSA algorithm, BioDesigner can show users a glance of how the design will perform. With BioDesigner's interactive simulator, user can check the amount of a certain compound at any time, or during any time period.
