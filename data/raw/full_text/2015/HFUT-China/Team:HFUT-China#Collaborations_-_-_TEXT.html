Collaborations with OUC-China
With the ambition to make a better software tool for Synthetic Biology, we collaborate with OUC-China team to make our product truly helpful.
For the simulator, OUC-China is interested in a automative simulation tool to test their design, and we collaborate in BioDesigner Simulator. OUC-China provided us a complete explanation about the process and method they used in modeling. They also provided us their modeling results. By comparing those information with BioDesigner simulator, problems can be found and corrected.
For the recommendation in BioDesigner, the most important thing is to make sure our recommendations are truly helpful to Synthetic Biologist in their works. OUC-China provides us their gene circuit design, which can be used in the test of recommendation.
For a software, user experience is always of great value. OUC-China joined the alpha test and give us lots of valuable suggestions which is important in improving our product.
