People need to do their design based on lots of paper reading and information search. To determine which parts and BioBricks to use, even more repetitiously work needs to be done. After all that works the gene express results are still unclear. All those things leads to tons of works, makes the creative work become kind of boring. All those works can be completed with todayâ€™s advanced computer technology. So we develop the BioDesigner, a computer assistant for Synthetic Biologist.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="sec-content"><DIV class="whole-info"><P>With BioDesigner, Synthetic Biologist can get recommendations. We will generate two types of recommendation. One is based on the parts that has already been used, the other is based on the last part in the designing chain. User can choose one to use, check information for part, or just ignore them.</P><P>Our product also provide gene express simulation. The system will simulate the gene express process and show the productions through time. With the simulation system, user can have a glance of their design before they put them into real Biology testing.</P><P>For the system scope, BioDesigner also can give recommendation about systems that might be useful. Also, BioDesigner can form the Pathway based on the input material and output productions, which can help the user gets a better view about their design. By comparing the current pathway with the entire gene pathway graph, Some interesting recommendation can be shown to the user.</P><P>The main purpose of BioDesigner is to develop an assistant for Synthetic Biology and makes Synthetic Biology design process to be more robotized. We are doing it and we are doing it well.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
