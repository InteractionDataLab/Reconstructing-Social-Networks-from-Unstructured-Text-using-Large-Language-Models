To make all those things happends, we spend lots of time on designing every part, every detail about BioDesign. From the user interface, user experience to the algorithm and every line of code behind them, we made all of them to be perfect.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="info-sec" id="ui"><DIV class="sec-title"><H3 class="sec-head">User Interface Design</H3></DIV><DIV class="sec-content"><DIV class="whole-info"><P>Before we designed the UI of the Biodesigner, we had to consider who will use our product. certainly, the user of the BioDesigner is who engage in synthetic biology work like designing biology devices. But it is a trouble that we have no idea for the thought of them. So we tried to contact other teams of iGEM and talked with them about requirement of this new tool. Then, we understood that they previous habit of synthetic biology work is consulting many document. That is troublesome and uncertain. They need a powerful platform to get clear and wide information. So BioDesigner is aimed to private lots of information and have a friendly interaction, and focus on overcoming any trouble in user experience.</P><P>To make sure that user can have a suitable interaction as their expectation, there are five interfaces, welcome, project, device design, system design, simulation. welcome interface is the first interface, and project interface connect all other interface. the logic of interaction is very certain. we keep the consistency of visual style and interacting method, but it is certain difference between interfaces.So they can recognize it immediately when users enter a interface, and they do not feel confused after the interface changed.</P><P>By the way, the design of Logo is based on a DNA shape in a unique angle. We design it in minimalism style, to make sure it can give people a deep impression, and hope it can apply in any kinds of instance.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="info-sec" id="algorithm"><DIV class="sec-title"><H3 class="sec-head">Algorithm</H3></DIV><DIV class="sub-title">Markov</DIV><DIV class="sec-content right"><DIV class="info"><P>The biobrick chain recommendation function was achieved by markov transition matrix, which consists of probabilities of successive biobricks.

One letter represent one BioBrick. We could see BioBricks “a” and “k” follow the “f”, so the number of “f” is two (ignore the end BioBrick of chain), the number of “a” following “f” is one and the number of “k” following the “f” is one. We can calculate the probability from “f” to “a” is 1/2 and the probability from “f” to “k” is 1/2. Then, we can calculate all probability through above process. After calculate, the result is as follows: </P></DIV><DIV class="whole-info">With the given BioBricks, we calculate probabilities of next BioBricks. The probabilities and parent node of these next BioBricks are recorded. In order to save memory, we only record the BioBricks’ information with nonzero probability. When two same BioBricks have different probabilities, we compare the probabilities and save the higher probability BioBricks information. When we iterate the length size time, we would get some predicted chain whose length is user’ demand. Then we sort brobick chains according to the probabilities. Finally, we provide some predicted chains that user maybe need.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="sub-title">Aprior</DIV><DIV class="sec-content"><DIV class="whole-info"><P>First using the apriori algorithm to find frequent item sets of all parts.The first step we set a number between 0 and 1, and call this number for the support degree,the second step requires count frequency of all parts’ occurrence ,reserved the parts whose frequency of occurrence is greater than support degree ,forming the frequent item sets whose length is one .

                    The speed of access and response are key factors in UX. To make the server response time as short as it can be, we used lots of strategies. We use nginx as our server for its stability and high performance. Also, by separating the static from the dynamic, the load on the server side can be balanced. For we use Django as the web framework and its multi threading feature, the server can also handle multiple request simultaneously.
