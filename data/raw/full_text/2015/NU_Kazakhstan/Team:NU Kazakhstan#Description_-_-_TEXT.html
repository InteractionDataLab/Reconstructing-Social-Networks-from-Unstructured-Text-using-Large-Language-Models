Project Description
NU_Kazakhstan iGEM Team aims to develop several smart systems that will protect teeth from caries. This summer is devoted for targeting the Streptococcus mutans as the main microbial agent that causes caries. First, our team has isolated DNA from saliva samples of our team members by the protocol using Instagene matrix provided by BioRAD. The primer sets Sm479F/R for the isolation of the S.mutans(UA159) were synthesized by Techno Park of Nazarbayev University. The sequence of primers was taken from paper written by Deepak Saxena et.al. The unique amplicon of S.mutans  comprises 479 base pairs and it was detected by PCR. Our aim is to target genes responsible for the competence and lactic acid production of S.mutans. The CRISPR/dCas9 system will be implemented for targeting genes of interest such as VicK and XrpA. The finished parts will be inserted into pMSP3535 plasmid regulated by nisin. The dCas9 will be taken from 2015 iGEM distribution Kit. Our project encourages idea of putting together synthetic Biology and maintaining healthy life.
