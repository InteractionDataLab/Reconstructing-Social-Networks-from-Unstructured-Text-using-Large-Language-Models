This year our team presented the concepts of iGEM competition to the young business entrepreneurs from all over the country.
We presented two projects: the project of 2014 year, p53 protein detecting antibodies, and the current: Prevention of Dental Caries by Targeting Streptococcus mutans Mechanisms of Quorum Sensing and Production of Lactic Acid.
We had a lot of questions regarding the commercialization of the projects and about the future directions of our research, new ideas, recruitment of new students and the requirements to be enrolled in iGEM team.
After the meeting we had a group photo with our amazing instructors and some members that were present during discussion.
