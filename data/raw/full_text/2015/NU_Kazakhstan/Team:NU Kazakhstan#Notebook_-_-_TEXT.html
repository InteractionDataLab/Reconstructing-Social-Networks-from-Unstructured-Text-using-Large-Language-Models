Preparation of the LB agar
We used 37 g of nutrient agar for 400 mL of distilled water
Extraction of genome from S.mutans
First, culture S.mutans in 5 mL liquid  BHI + bacitracin
Centrifuge for 15 min at 4000 rpm
Then dissolve the pellet in 500 microliters of Lysis Buffer
How to prepare Lysis Buffer (1 mL):
Lysis Buffer contains EDTA,          Tween 80%, tris HCl,125 microliters of 8 M EDTA,5 µl of Tween 80,          Tris HCl 1M 50 µl, Proteinase K (200 µg/mL). 0.0002 grams of powder Proteinase K were put into 1 mL of Lysis Buffer.                                                      The balance could not read 0.0002 g of proteinase K, so 0.02 g of proteinase K were taken.
Incubation for 2 hours at 55°C. Heat at 90°C for 5 minutes.
Then add equal volume of cold isopropyl alcohol.
Incubate in freezer for 20 minutes.
Centrifuge at the maximum speed for 30 min. Remove the supernatant.
Add enough amount of ethanol to the pellet in order to wash
Then add 50 µl of TE buffer
Add 0.5 µl of the RNAase
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour
Inactivate at 60°C for 10 min
Run it in an agarose gel
