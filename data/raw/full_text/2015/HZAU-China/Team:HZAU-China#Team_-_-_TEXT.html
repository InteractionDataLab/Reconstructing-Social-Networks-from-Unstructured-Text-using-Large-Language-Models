About us
"Hi, we are HZAU-China, iGEM team from Huazhong Agricultural University. This is our third time into the competition and our team has members from across colleges and years. We adopt the motto, "iGEM is just for fun, but you should work hard", and see this competition as an opportunity to foster scientific innovation among undergraduates. Through the hard work in summer, wish we could say more."

Luo Xudong
Hello, I'm Xudong Luo, It is honored to be the leader of HZAU-China iGEM team. In this year, I focused on establishing and managing team, discussing and designing the Project, doing some experiments about synthetic gene oscillator, such as standardization of BioBrick, and construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices.
Yang Mian
This year participate in lab-work, I love making friends, that's really interesting! Also I'm learning the video clips, take some photos, make some clips, really enjoying it.
Yan Keji
Duang, I'm Keji Yan, you can call me jack. My name means science and technology in Chinese, so I believe that no life, no science. Besides as the leader of wetlab group, I always do experiments in minutes, because the faster you do, the closer your dream is.
Zhu Qi
Hi, I'm Zhu Qi. It's my great honour to be one part of our iGEM team. My main work is about wet lab. I enjoy the time spent with so many lovely teammates.
Liu Kai
Nowadays, people can not live without computer, it has penetrated into every aspect of our daily lives, so computer is referred to as a tool for people to solve problem, I believe that we can use it to help us to discover mysteries in Synthetic Biology. I love computer, I love Synthetic Biology, I love iGEM, I also Love our team --- HZAU-China!  I'm Kai Liu.
Guo Xiaoxue
Hi, iGEMers, My name is Xiaoxue Guo，This is the second  time I participate in iGEM. I mainly  work on circuit connection. It's  great honor  to work with my lovely team members. I'll never forget the invaluable experience.
Li Zeyao
I'm Li Zeyao, majored in Bioinformatics. I like smiling very much, holding that life will be full of beauty with a positive attitude. I mainly work on the modeling part, a little challenge to me. But I enjoy it.
Wang Shuangqi
Hi！I am Shuangqi, This is my first time that I participate in iGEM. I focus on mathematical modeling and wiki making in the team this year. My life motto is: life is brilliant，It is like a mirror, if you smile at it, it will smile back to you.
Zhang Qian
Participated mainly in constructing the framework, the amelioration of our project, the design of the connection part and being in charge of the hardware. It's the second time for me being participated in this team. I adore animals, plants, national instruments and...of course, the time I am in HZAU-China!

Li Shangjin
Hello, I take charge of work in human practice. As a student from journalism, working in iGEM project really broaden my mind. I hope our HP work this year could make sense to all iGEMers.
Xiao Yi
Hi, I like designing, and I love drawing. That's why I choose to participate in this project. There are many lovely friends and teachers. As a designer, I hope that can change a little bit more of the world, make it better.
Wu Yibo
Hi iGEMers from all around the world, I'm Yibo(Michael) Wu and I'm working on constructing the genetic circuits, I've learned a lot in this year, I believe that we would get a good grades this year.
Chen Yu
Hello, I am chenyu. A boy from Huazhong Agricultural University. I like biology, and I am sure that can change the world. I hope what I do can save the lives of others in the future, it's all my dream.
Yang Junqi
Hi, I mainly worked on one of constructing genetic circuits—quorum-sensing oscillator.
I mainly focused on lab-work. At the same time, I was responsible for safety work with another teammate. In the summer vocation, I was also in charge of policy practises. I want to understand life in different perspectives. I am also pleasant to try to doing challengeable work.
Hua Kangjian
My name is Hua Kangjian. I enjoy studying, communicating and programming. For the sake of improving myself, I come here. I do many chores in the group, such as the modeling, the hardware and the wiki design... And I gained more than I can see here. Wish we can get a good grades this autumn！
       
Li Jun
Hello! My name is Leo. Chinese name is Jun li. Now, I am a Sophomore student majored in bioscience. I think our project mixed-reality cell is the first step for the human going to the virtual world. I am responsible for the interlab part and light sensor of the cell part in this project. My motto is: life is tough, but you should be tougher.
Chu Pan
I'm Pan Chu. Sonic is my English name. I was responsible for measuring and designing the microfluidic chips. I also did wet experiments, Interlab device was the first genetic circuit I assembled by myself. I will devote more energy into iGEM, because I love her!
Instructors
1
Ma Binguang
Prof. Ma is our direct instructor. He has seen us through thick and thin, and has been with us in times of happiness and sorrow. His field of research is systems biology and synthetic biology, and this time, the inspiration of our project is from him. We all love him, for he is not only our instructor, but also our friends.
