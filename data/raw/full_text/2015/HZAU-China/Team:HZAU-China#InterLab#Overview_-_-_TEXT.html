Overview
This year, we are not only in general event but also participate in Measurement Interlab. All the iGEM teams that are in this Interlab Study should collect fluorescence intensity data of three specific genetic devices which  is the same with others and can express GFP protein.
The three genetic devices differ in their promotors :
Device 1: J23101 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), in the pSB1C3 backbone
Device 2: J23106 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), in the pSB1C3 backbone
Device 3: J23117 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), in the pSB1C3 backbone
Firstly, we transformed these three devices into competent cells (DH 5 alpha) respectively. And then, We did pre-experiment before formal experiment to confirm the suitable period as well as the dilution factor. What’s more, their fluorescence intensity is measured with a plate reader in suitable optical density of the LB medium. We assumed that the GFP expression quality of them ordered from high to low would be Device 1, Device 2, Device 3. Finally, the result confirmed our conjecture.
