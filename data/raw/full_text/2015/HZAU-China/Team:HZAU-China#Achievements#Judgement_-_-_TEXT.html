Judgement
We apply for a Gold Medal, Best Information Processing Project, Best Model, Best Policy &Practices Project.
As for the Gold Medal
We have met these requirements below:
1.Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
2.Complete the Judging form.
3.Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
4.Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5.We have finished the description of each project, clearly attributed work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. You can see it in our attribution & acknowledgement.
6.We have documented and submitted the 8 parts to the iGEM Registry.
7.We experimentally validated that our five devices of input module ( BBa_K1713020 , BBa_K1713000 , BBa_K1713021 , BBa_K1713003 , BBa_K1713004 ) work as expected.
8.We have submittd two new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry( BBa_K1713020 , BBa_K1713000 ).
9.This year ,we volunteered in science & technology museum,and we helped local primary school completed lab courses,etc.You can see thin in our Human Practice Page.
10.We wrote a paper to Discusion of new life form!
11.we offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit constructio and we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical model for WHU-China team.
12.Interact with your community by creating an engaging activity that showcases iGEM, synthetic biology and community labs. This activity could involve teaching a class to your community, running a public form to promote the discussion of synthetic biology, or another activity. Create a video about the community activity you did for your bronze medal, showing how you interacted with your community. Make the video available on your wiki, and send the file to iGEM HQ (email hq AT igem DOT org).
13.We have designed a device from the light to assist to complete the oscillation of the coupling,and it can be see from the video .
As for Best Model:
In terms of our project, modeling part is performed at the same time with the wet lab, which is different from simple prediction or verification. Through analysis of the biological process, two oscillators are respectively built in E.coli and computer. To reach our goal, mixed-reality state, we divide it into three stages, the former two of which have been completed. We have achieved the coupling of virtual and virtual system, and even the coupling of real and virtual part through interface devices. It’s an excited moment to witness the coupling simulation result in Video 1 and 2.
As for the Best Information Processing Project:
The life system in the real world and the virtual world is thought to be entirely independent. The gap between them appears to be hard broken down. However, we choose an oscillator to stand for the life system of both real and virtual and the light is regarded as the medium to connect them together. This ingenious design leads to the data exchanging between them be accessible. This is truly an unprecedented attempt. Till now, we have completed a perfect loop to make the information flowed and have confirmed it is effective.
