Collaboration
iGEM teams are a big family. All teams register the competition are encouraged to help each other to make the projects better! Collaboration is really an important part in the process of competition.
This year, we built close cooperative relation to HUST-China , WHU-China and ZJU-China and helped each other to make our project better.
1、we offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit construction. They failed when they used a reporter in their test experiment. We provided them with an essential reporter part we constructed (B0034+E0040+B0015)  and succeeded inserting the reporter part respectively to the downstream of the three ptrp mutants.
2、when dealing with the Interface Device, we met some trouble about the usage of SCM (Single Chip Micyoco) as we were not familiar with it. Thus, we turned to ZJU-China for help and they soon provide us a basic program which can change the brightness of LED through controlling PWM as a reference and later other suggestions online.
3、WHU-China team communicated with us frequently. Due to the lack of team member working on modeling, they turned to our team for help. After learning about their project, we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical model for it.
In addition we also received assistance from WHU-China team when we decided to adopt a light control system in our project. They helped us to construct a section of light control system, saving our precious time.
