Project
With the rapid development of biology and computer technologies, the era of mixed-reality is coming, which has profound influence on the future research. In this project, we are working on creating a new kind of life form, mixed-reality  cells (MR. Cell),  which are half-real and half-virtual.

WetLab
In wetlab, we constructed a genetic oscillator in E. coli as the real part. In order to connect the real oscillator in E. coli with the virtual oscillator in computer simulation, a light control circuit associated with the oscillator was adopted. Besides, we do a series of verifying and testing work to confirm that the real part can work.

Modeling
Corresponding to the real part, an e-oscillator was simulated in a computer as the virtual part. To validate the coupling process, we simulated the interaction between the two e-oscillators. Besides, mixed-reality state of physical systems was demonstrated to indicate that our MR. Cell could work.

Hardware
Till now, the real part and the virtual part have all been done. But, how can we combine them together? That's what we do at the hardware part. We aim at unifying the two parts to form an inter-reality system, MR. Cell.

Team
Our team is made up of 17 members with different majors and can be divided into three groups, wet-lab, modeling and connection. But, we cooperate well to accomplish our dream. It’s the third time for us to participate in this event.

OutReach
This year, not only did we fight in the laboratory, but also we did a lot of great human practise to help our project. We have carried out iGEM's tradition that share your ideas and enjoy the game.
