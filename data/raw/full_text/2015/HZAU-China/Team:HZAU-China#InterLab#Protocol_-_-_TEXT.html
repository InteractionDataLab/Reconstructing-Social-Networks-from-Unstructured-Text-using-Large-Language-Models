Assembly
All constructs were taken directly from the iGEM 2015 distribution plates. We used biobrick assembly.
Click here to get Plasmid profiles of three devices.
Plasmid1 profile of three devices.
Plasmid2 profile of three devices.
Plasmid3 profile of three devices.
The correct identity of the resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Click here get nucleotide sequences.
Transforming these three devices into competent cells (DH 5 alpha) respectively. Incubate E.coli with 20 ml LB medium at 37℃ and 180 rpm. Add  appropriate antibiotics samples (chloramphenicol for J23101, J23106, J23117 and all devices. Ampicillin for I13504.). Both antibiotics were added from 1000x stock stored at -20℃ for a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for Ampicillin and 20 μg/m for chloramphenicol, respectively.
Per-experiment
Here is some reason we did pre-experiment.
(1) Confirm the best dilution factor.
(2) Confirm the suitable period for measurement.
(3) Draw a growth curves.
Formal experiment
1. We set 3 groups except 3 experimental groups (Device 1, Device 2 and Device 3).One of these groups was negative control (GFP at PSB1C3.) and the positive control is R0040,which is pTetR in pSB1C3.Last we used LB medium as background. All groups were triplicate.
2. We incubated samples in 5 ml centrifuge tubes, then measuring at 96 wells plates. We used SynergyTM H1 Multi-Mode Reader to measured fluorescence intensity and optical density. There is the website of this instrument:
http://www.biotek.com/products/product_print.html?newsid=10711
Because there is a OD detector on the top of 96-well plate, pathlength of light would affect the optical density.
A=ε b c.
We add LB medium into wells to dilute sample will lengthen pathlength of light.
x: the volume of media to dilute the samples.
It is clear that A’=A, diluting sample will not work.
We added more samples to lengthen pathlength but the concentration of biomass will not be changed.
x =μl.
(1) Add 200μl sample to measure optical density.
(2) Use formula to calculate the volume for adjusting the OD600.
(3) Use silver paper to pack 5ml centrifuge tubes (for shaking culture) to eliminate the influence of illumination.
3. Here is the protocol of Multi-Mode Reader.
