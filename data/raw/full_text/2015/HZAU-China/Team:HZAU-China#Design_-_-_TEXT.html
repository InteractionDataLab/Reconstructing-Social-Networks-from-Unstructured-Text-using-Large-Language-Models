Mixed-reality of physics
As you can see at the Project page, to simplify the goal, we have divided our final goal into three phases. Compared the purpose between phase 1 and 2, phase 2 can be regarded as just putting out one of the two oscillators in computer into LED while others are nearly the same. In the same time, the target as well as a program for the interface device at phase 2 and 3 make almost no difference. So based on the successful result of phase 1 and completed phase 3, phase 2 seem to be achieved easily. The phase 2 is called Mixed- reality of physics which means that the coupling between the virtual part in computer and the real part of physics. The assumption is that the oscillators of computer and the LED can react with each other and end up in highly coupling.
Design principles
As for this part, we intend to construct a perfect circle.
Fig.1 the diagram of our design
At the beginning, the e-oscillator and the physical oscillator work independently. A period of time later, the camera start to detect the light intensity of LED beads and send the data to a computer. After quick analysis of these two oscillators, the computer would change the parameters of oscillation functions and send changed new data to a single chip. Finally, the status of LED would be uploaded after the command of a single chip. And then, go on this loop again and again till the Mixed-reality sate achieved.
Device
Based on the design principles above, we constructed a device as following.

Results
The program of computer is in MATLAB while it’s Python in Pyboard. And the results turned to be inspiring that the whole design worked successfully, including interface device, programs and the simulation in computer.
The phase 2 has completed and this device can be applied to the phase 3 directly. Once this simple camera is replaced by a fluorescence microscope with cells cultured on a microfluidic chips, the device of the phase 3 would be done and are possible to make Mixed-reality state come true. Thus, it’s the prototype of MR. Cell and has great potential in a wide range of the future biological research.
