Overview
In wetlab, as the real part of MR-Cell ,we construct two genetic oscillator circuits in E.coli. The one is the quorum sensing oscillator based on quorum sensing, the other is the dual feedback oscillator based a hybrid promoter. They have different character and application for our project to couple with the virtual part. To connect with the oscillator in computer, we adopted a light control system associated with the oscillator in E.coli, so we can regulate the oscillator through light controlled by computer and the two parts can couple with each other eventually.
Furthermore, in order to further achieve our goal, we did some verification and test about the real part. Such as the verification of oscillation, the effect of light on the expression of genes associated with the oscillator, and the test of the related promoter : para/lacI, pluxpR.
Besides when doing that work, we have done some communications and collaborations with other teams. For example we helped HSTU-CHINA team to construct a essential part , and WHU-CHINA team helped us to construct a section of light control system.
Finally we wetlab group is full of love and happiness. Even we must work very hard, but everyone of us enjoyed the process and tried their best to achieve our goal . Because we are firmly convinced that what we are doing is worthwhile and great.
