Results
1. Here are results of per-experiment.
The growth curve of bacteria was s-shaped. The data of OD600 reached the top when cells were incubated for 11 hours and half of maximum for about 9 hours.
Fig.1 Growth curve of per-experiment As is shown below, the maximum of this curve is about 0.133 at 16 hours and later then it begins to drop down. It is about half of maximum when sample was incubated about 9 hours, so we choose 9 hours as measuring situation.
2. Here are results of formal experiment
Each sample here was given in arbitrary units-fluorescence intensity/OD600.
We used 5ml centrifuge tubes to culture our samples and they were measured by a plate reader after 9 hours’ incubating. Three separate colonies were taken from the same sample.
The following is our calculation method.
F=F1-F0
O=O1-O0
F/O is the final data.
F1 : Fluorescence intensity of experimental groups(include three devices) .
F0 : Fluorescence intensity of negative control(E.coli with I13504 in pSB1C3).
O1: Optical density of experimental groups (include three devices) .
O0: Optical density of background(LB media).
Fig.2 A1-A9 are the measured values of Device1 and A1-A3 are one of the measured values of technical repeats. A1-A3, A4-A6 and A7-A9 are biological repeats respectively.B1-B9 and C1-C9 are the measured values of Device 2 and Device 3 respectively. D1-D9 are the measured values of positive control while E1-E9 are the measured values of negative control. F1-F9 are values of background(LB medium).
