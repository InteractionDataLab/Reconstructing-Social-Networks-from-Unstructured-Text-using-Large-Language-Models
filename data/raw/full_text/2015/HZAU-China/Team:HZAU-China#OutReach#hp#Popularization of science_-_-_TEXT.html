Popularization of science
Our research begins from these question:
1.Who should be in duty bound to the popularization of science?
2.Researcher? Government? NGO? Or business organization?
3.Which part of the government? Propaganda Department? Education Department? Or just any department related to scientific problem should speak for themselves?
4.Is there any work overlapped in different departments? How can the government build a science popularization system?
In America, there is a clear mechanism to answer these questions. The popularization mechanism of science in America is actually relied on American democracy.
Our research aims to judge the current situation of science popularization in China just as the point of scientific communication.
Due to the participation of iGEM, we learn about the science outreach system in America.
In China, working on scientific communication doesn’t relate to the judgement of a scholar or an institution. But for Chinese conventional view, scholars are sacred like saints. They have a higher social position than the citizen.
Nowadays, most scientists have recognized the significance and importance of scientific popularization activities, but they haven't realized to be responsible for it as well.
A survey explores the differences between scientists and  taxpayers in participating in scientific popularization and their responsibility towards it. In these 156 questionnaires, 110 scientists that believed to be involved in popularizing science are responsible to taxpayers, accounting for 70.5%; 24 people think that it does not matter, accounting for 15.4%; another 22 people select No, accounts for 14.1%. Actually the rate of people who have chosen for  ‘NO’ is smaller than it is.
Especially when considering the argument of GMO’s safety, the relationship between life science circle and the public has totally been broken down.
Though the methods of scientific workers to be participated in scientific activities are diverse, they lack motivation to join the scientific communication because  popularization  science is not included in the scientific evaluation mechanisms.
We are trying to find a possible solution to these matters.
Our research is divided into two parts. One investigated researchers standpoint of science communication, presented as their views on a set of questions.
Whether the work on popular science should be included into the judging system or not?
How? In what forms? Has it already been included in an invisible way?
Researchers view of bringing in science popularisation into scientific evaluation mechanisms.
Based on both surveys, analyzed and discussed the establishment of domestic science communication system.We hope we can find a way to make the potential science popularization policy more acceptable to researchers.
Because of financial problem our investigation was suspended, we hope this research could come to a conclusion before the giant jamboree.
China has entered the time of building a harmonious civil society, which is an irreversible historical process. Public should be respected. Science Communication as an evolution of the concept that needs to be updated. We hope our work can be beneficial to this process.
