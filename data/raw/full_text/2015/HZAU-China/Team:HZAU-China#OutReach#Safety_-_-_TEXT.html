Final safety form
General safety matters:
In our lab there is a safety training for everyone which covered following aspects:
1. Personal prospective wear: lab coat and gloves must be worn all the time during work
2. Chemical safety: we have printed “Dos and don’ts when using hazardous chemicals” and posted them on marked place.
3. GMO safety: no biology materials are allowed to bring out of our lab and biology waste must be put to bacterial waste.
4. Studying biosafety: we have also listed some websites of biosafety for our teammates to study:

Our lab
Our lab locates in the building of college of life science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural.
There are two access control system to prevent unauthorized persons form entering, you have to show your student ID card to get into our lab.
Our project
The organisms we used in our project is a kind of non-toxic E.coli(k-12 derivatives) we used sequences that are already available as Biobricks and we didn’t create new protein coding sequences. We use GoldViewTM as Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, lab gloves must be worn when we use it.
