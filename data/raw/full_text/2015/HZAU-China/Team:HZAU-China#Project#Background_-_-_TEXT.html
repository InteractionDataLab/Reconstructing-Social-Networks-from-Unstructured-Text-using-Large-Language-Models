Background
As we know, computer technology has brought about great revolution in human life from 20th century. Now, we entered into 21th century, a century of life science. The developments of computer science and life science both impact profoundly on our world and society. They also promote the productivity of our society. We can’t help imagining what will happen if these two subjects combine. We can’t predict what will happen. However, we believe that the combination has great potential, and even trigger the next revolution.
Reviewing the development history of computer science and life science, we can find that these two subjects begin to combine gradually. Especially in recent years, with the elevation of computer simulation ability, many scientific researches can be carried out by means of computer simulation in the virtual world. Computer simulation technology has wide applications in life science researches. For example, man-machine interaction, artificial intelligence and visual simulation environment of medicine research all involve computer simulation that creates a virtual reality. It is not exaggerated to claim that we have entered into a mix-reality era [1]. So we are thinking: why not to create a mix-reality system as a new life form that is half in the real world and half in the virtual world?
Researchers have explored the mix-reality states in physical systems [2, 3]. By setting a simple pendulum in reality and designing a simulation program in computer, mixed-reality states were obtained by bidirectional coupling between the real and virtual pendulums. On the other hand, in the realm of biology, researchers have constructed two genetic oscillation circuits in bacteria and coupled them based on queuing theory [4]. Inspired by these researches, we want to achieve a bidirectional coupling between organisms and computers to create a new united life form. We believe that such a life form possessing the designability of computers and the evolvability of organisms will make a big difference in the future.
