Overview
As our team is competing this year's competition, we also required to participate in the iGEM 2015 Measurement Interlab study. The goal of the Interlab study is to obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP from iGEM teams around world.
The three genetic devices differ in their promotors :
Device 1: J23101 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
Device 2: J23106 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
Device 3: J23117 + I13504 (B0034-E0040-B0015), must be built in the pSB1C3 backbone
We transformed the three devices into competent cell (DH 5 alpha) and measured fluorescence as well as optical density of the LB medium at the suitable period (We did pre-experiment before formal experiment for confirming the suitable period as well as the dilution factor), using a plate reader, respectively. We hypothesized that the GFP expression quality of the three devices level is Device 1, Device 2, Device 3, respectively. And our final result accord with our hypothesis.
