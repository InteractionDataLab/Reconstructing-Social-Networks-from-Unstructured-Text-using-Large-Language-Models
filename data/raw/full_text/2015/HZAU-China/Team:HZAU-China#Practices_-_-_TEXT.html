Human Practice
This year we did some great thought experiments to imagine what we want to achieve and discuss. As we know, synthetic biology aims to create new life systems never exist in nature. So, we came up with an idea why not design a new life form. Nowadays, artificial intelligence develops so fast. We are curious about what if computers and organisms become the same system. Therefore, we thought and described why our project mix-realty cell was a new form. And we considered the possibility of evolution of mix-realty cell. In the meanwhile, we also considered what mix-realty cell could be applied for and what mix-realty cell could influence our lives. Moreover, we did other work to help our project. We think deeply about the current situation of popularization of life science in China. We try to figure out if there is a way to change this circumstance. And we also do some outreach activities to raise public understanding of our project.
Public outreach
1.Volunteered in science & technology museum
At the time of Children's Day, we helped volunteer in Wuhan science&technology museum. We have a great day with kids~
2.Help local primary school completed lab courses
Many primary school in China don’t has lab. We decide to help a school in our community by offering our lab to them to complete their experimental education.
3.IGEM TalkX: Synthetic biology training club
Our university is a comprehensive university based on agriculture and life science. So the public has a good foundation and open attitude on synthetic biology. We set up a club to communicate with everyone concern about synthetic biology. The communication began at every weekend. We are happy to see it's really make great sense to all participant. Most of our team member were elected from the club member.
Meet up
1.2015 iGEM Asian Conference NCTU
This summer vacation, our five teammates of our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taipei to take part in 215 iGEM Asian Conference.
In Taipei, we shared our idea and experience of experiments and mathematic modeling with other igmers. There were so many enthusiastic students from famous university. In the conference, we talked about projects, some problem we ever faced. Not only did we talk projects and science, but also we made precious friends.
2.Conference of three university of Central China
The three university Consortium of Central China is consist of, HUST-China、WHU-China and HZAU-China. In the meeting we discussed project，teams and other problems we met. Beside We plan to build a shared platform, which contains the information of synthetic biology, the laboratory equipment of wetlab and so on.
We are also considering to expanding the breadth of communication. We choose iGEM, we love biology, why don’t we talking about more biology problems not just for a competition? it must be cool, and we are trying to do that !
3.2015 CCIC PEKING
We are invited to participate in the second CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer's Committee) hosted by Peking on August 14th-15th. In the presentation time, many teams show their project and ideas about H&P、wiki and so on. In tea break time, we communicated actively with other teams about our project, and received many good advice and suggestions.
By the way, the CCiC means “Central China iGEMers Consortium”. It’s origin from the 1st Central China iGEMers' meet up hosted by our team in 2014. This year, There is a novel idea occur in our mind: How about make the CCiC to be a iGEMer’s Olympics in China? That’s means the host team will change in each Olympic game. Isn’t it interesting？
CCiC aims to deepen the connections between iGEM teams and to provide a collaboration platform for iGEMers to explore the frontiers of synthetic biology. We leant a lot from that and met many new friends while enjoying the meetup time. In this way we think iGEM teams will communicate with each other closely and the influence of iGEM will spread in a wider range in China.
Policy practises
Popularization of science
(Read more) The science popularisation mechanism of science in America is rely on America democracy. Our research is trying to judge the current situation of science popularise in China on science communication’s point. And during the participation of iGEM, we learn about science outreach system in America.
Thought and inspiration
(Read more) There are some amazing thought experiments. We assumed many results for our projects and considered the future of mix-reality cell. These thought experiments revealed why we want to design such a new life form. And they also pushed us to discover life's mysteries. Our ideas may be a little crazy, but these ideas all are our understandings for life science.
