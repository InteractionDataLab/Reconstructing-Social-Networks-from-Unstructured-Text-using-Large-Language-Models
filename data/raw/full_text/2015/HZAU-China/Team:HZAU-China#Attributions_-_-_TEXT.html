Special thanks to Jin Anjiang and Huang Wei, who went to great lengths to help us smooth over many administrative troubles. We should also thank professors Mang Binguang, Ni Fuchuang and Gao Yijun, who taught us with great patience how to use singlechip to program for our project and friendly give us suggestions. And besides, we should also thank professors Kang Qinshu, and Gao jun who kindly guided us through the microfluidic and the construction of oscillators.
External support
Thanks for the iGEM foundation for providing us with most of our materials, and we should also thanks the following people for giving us additional supports.
Thanks professor Jaffrey for allowing us to use and submit the aptamar.
Thanks Ku Jing, graduate student of HZAU and Chen Xuanhong, graduate student of ZJU for some help of Interface software.
Thanks the clerk of TsingKe company named Zhang Junjie who helped us with the synthesis of the aptamer.
Meanwhile, we should thank WHU-China, who generously offered us with some parts and device that we didn't have. And thanks to ZJU-China, who shared us a basic program as a reference.
Project support and advice :
We appreciate Tian Liu(the captain of 2014 iGEM) most for helping us in all aspects of our project constantly. No matter the wetLab, modeling, activites or other parts. He has been giving us advice and ideas.
We thanks to Han Yichao(a 2014 iGEMer) for giving us some suggestions about our modeling part. From him, we have saved a lot of time.
Besides the people mentioned above, we should also thank the following professors and upperclassmen, who offered many suggestions to our project:
Mang Binguang, Peng Donghai, Zhang Hongyu, Zhen Yonglian ,Zhen Shixue, Cao Gang, Wang Gejiao, He Jin, Song Ming and Gao Jun.
Special
We must thank our two instructors, professor Zhang Hongyu and professor Ma Binguang, especially professor Ma, who devoted a lot of time efforts into us and has been with us throughout the whole competition. And we must thank the members of last year's HZAU-China, without their efforts and achievements, we wouldn't have got sufficient support this year, and they are: Tian Liu, Lu Huifang, Han Yichao, Zhang Peijing, Zhen Yihui, Li Fuyao
