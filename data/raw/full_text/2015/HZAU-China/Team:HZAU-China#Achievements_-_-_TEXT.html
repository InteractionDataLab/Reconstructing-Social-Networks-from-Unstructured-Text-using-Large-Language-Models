We apply for a Gold Medal, Best Information Processing Project, Best Model, Best Policy & Practices Project.
As for the Gold Medal
We have met these requirements below:
1.Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
2.Complete the Judging form.
3.Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
4.Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5.We have finished the description of each project, clearly attributed work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. You can see it in our attributions & acknowledgements.
6.We have documented and submitted the 8 parts to the iGEM Registry.
7.We experimentally validated that the five devices of our input module. ( BBa_K1713020 , BBa_K1713000 , BBa_K1713021 , BBa_K1713004 ) could work as expected.
8.We have submittd two new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry( BBa_K1713020 , BBa_K1713000 , BBa_K1713021 , BBa_K1713004 ).
9.This year ,we volunteered in science & technology museum,and we helped local primary school completed lab courses,etc.You can see thin in our Human Practice Page.
10.We wrote a paper to discuss the new life form!
11.We offered help to HUST-China team in their genetic circuit constructio and we analyzed the design of their genetic circuit carefully and built mathematical models for WHU-China team.
12.Interact with your community by creating an engaging activity that showcases iGEM, synthetic biology and community labs. This activity could involve teaching a class to your community, running a public form to promote the discussion of synthetic biology, or another activity. Create a video about the community activity you did for your bronze medal, showing how you interacted with your community. Make the video available on your wiki, and send the file to iGEM HQ (email hq AT igem DOT org).
13.We have designed a device using light to complete the coupling of oscillations,and it can be seen from the video .
As for the Best Information Processing Project:
The life systems in the real world and the virtual world are thought to be entirely independent. The gap between them appears to be hard to break. However, we choose an oscillator to stand for the life system of both real and virtual and the light is regarded as the medium to connect them together. This ingenious design leads to the data exchanging between them accessible. This is truly an unprecedented attempt. Till now, we have completed a perfect loop to make the information flowed and have confirmed it is effective.
As for Best Model:
In terms of our project, modeling part is performed at the same time with the wet lab, which is different from simple prediction or verification. Through analysis of the biological processes, two oscillators were built in E. coli and computer, respectively. To reach our goal, mixed-reality state, we divided it into three stages, the former two of which have been completed. We have achieved the coupling of virtual and virtual systems, and even the coupling of real and virtual parts through interface devices. It’s an excited moment to witness the coupling simulation results in Video 1 and 2.
As for the Best Policy &Practices Project:
This year, we have held and participated activities in various forms. Plenty of meeting up, education activity and novel club! We have joined 3 Meetups and have learned a great deal from others. We volunteered in science and technology museum at the Children's Day which integrated education and propaganda as one. Besides all the above, we focused on the inheritance and the expansion of influence in iGEM and set up a club to share fresh news with everyone concerned about synthetic biology. Moreover, we wrote a paper to show the deep reflection of the influence of our project.
