"Thank you for looking at our team page, my name is Evan.  I am a senior bioengineering major with a business administration minor, and I have had the pleasure of being this team’s captain.  It has been a tumultuous journey, but we have all learned so much more than we had ever dreamed.  The scope and vision of our project has global implications and even though we do not have a marketable product, we have made major strides in the field of synthetic biology.  With the creation of our KTP (kill the pylori) complex, we believe that we can prevent stomach cancer in 35-105 million people around the world.  Please peruse our page and email us any questions you might have about the prevalence of H. pylori or our method of treating/preventing it."

"Hi! I’m Lindsey Ly and I am a rising senior majoring in biology with a minor in biochemistry.  After graduating from UMass Dartmouth, I hope to pursue a PhD in synthetic and computational biology.  My research outside of the iGEM project involves engineering a synthetic microbial system in order to investigate the antibiotic induced-dynamics of the human intestinal microbiota.  As Vice President of the UMD Synthetic Biology Club/iGEM team, my main roles have been planning our project methodology and leading experiments in the lab."

"Hello my name is Brandon. This coming fall, I will be a junior in Mechanical Engineering  at the University of Massachusetts: Dartmouth. My main goal in life is to be be designing prosthetic limbs. I am a Resident Assistant and on the boards of two clubs on campus: the Synthetic Biology Club/iGEM 2015 team as the secretary and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) as a senator. Hobbies include playing the bass clarinet, video games (#teamNintendo), Snapchat and Facbook and spending quality time with friends and family. My main duties include taking notes on our weekly meetings, the upkeep of Twitter and Facebook accounts, the designing of our Wiki page as well as participate in the procedures and protocols.

"I'm Zak, I'm originally from Anchorage, Alaska and I'll be a senior bioengineering student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth this coming fall where I am also part of the hockey team. I'm interested in the prosthetic aspect of the field, but also in eventually becoming a medical doctor. My duty for this project is helping to find a peptide sequence to insert into a plasmid backbone, and also assist with finding some type of transport mechanism to excrete said peptide out of E. coli. All in hopes of murdering the evil H. pylori overlords of the stomach. "

"I'm Dean Robert a senior majoring in bioengineering. I don't have any special titles or position. My plans for the future are non-existent. Maybe you'll find me at the nearest street corner panhandling or maybe I'll continue my education. All I know for sure is that H. pylori is a real pain to grow."

"I am a senior Bioengineering student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. My role in my iGEM team has been to conduct and gather research and collaborate with team members to construct our research procedure. Additionally I was able to get ahold of our H. Pylori strain by contacting researchers who have worked with this type of H. Pylori. Finally, I have been very active in fundraising for our 2015 iGEM team as well as establishing a Synthetic Biology Club with our university to ensure funding for the 2016 iGEM team."

"Hi!  I'm Jake Palmer and I'm a grad-student/advisor for the 2015 iGEM team for UMass Dartmouth.  I hail from Purdue University where I was a Biology major and ran on the track team.  I'm working to help everyone with lab technique and guide the project to an overall success.  My grad thesis regards biodiesel production from industrial waste steams.  In my free time, I run a lot, and am proud to represent Janji, a Boston-based running apparel start-up focused on donating proceeds to clean water charities.  You should check them out @ runjanji.com."

"I, Christopher Brigham, Ph.D. am an Assistant Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I am a microbiologist and molecular geneticist with expertise in industrial biotechnology. I have received my doctorate in Molecular Microbiology from Tufts University School of Medicine, and performed postdoctoral training in the Department of Biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biodegradable plastic and alcohol biofuel productions in the industrially relevant microorganism Ralstonia eutropha. Finally, I am the faculty advisor for the UMass Dartmouth iGEM team."
