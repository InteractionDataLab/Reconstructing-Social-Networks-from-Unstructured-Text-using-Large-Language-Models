AAP2 targeted on the  cytoplasmic membrane, as its amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow it to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by barrel-stave mechanisms. What’s more, inside the AAP2, a alkaline amino carries positive charge in low pH environment can react with a non polar amino to form a more powerful structure that destroy the plasma membrane. So the AAP2 has higher function in low pH but almost non-activated in regular pH.  </SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:305px">BBP-M-AAP2</SPAN><H2>Features of AAP2</H2><SPAN>T1. pH trigged : The  AAP2 is more activated in low pH and this could be its most important feature.
The strategy of employing peptides with antimicrobial activity exclusively at low pH could be especially advantageous in dental caries prevention and treatment: cariogenic pathogens would be eliminated due to the local low pH environment surrounding these species, while these peptides should have minimal effect on commensal bacteria that do not produce acid.The resulting shift in microbial dental plaque composition would contribute to neutralizing plaque pH and drive the equilibrium towards tooth surface re-mineralization
                </SPAN><SPAN>2. Small and simple: The coding sequence for a AAP2 is only around 100 base pairs. For E.coli, 100 base pairs is totally within its working capacity. Therefore, E.coli can be a low-cost AAP2 factory, which means more efficient and more product.　</SPAN><SPAN>3. Secreted directly: Because AAP2 is secreted by the bacterium itself, the bacterium  would not form a resistance to it compare to use other inorganic chemicals or antibiotics.
		</SPAN><SPAN>Together, using AAP2 is totally a environmental friendly and safe way for solving dental caries in a long term. </SPAN><SPAN>This part is a coding gene of Targeted Antimicrobial Peptide AAP2&amp;Bac8c.</SPAN><SPAN>See our AAP2 ( Acid-activated Peptide) parts collection: <A href="#">######</A></SPAN><H2>Reference:</H2><SPAN>Lina Li, Jian He, Randal Eckert, Daniel Yarbrough, Renate Lux, Maxwell Anderson, and Wenyuan Shi. 2010.

		&lt;span&gt;1. Specific and stable: The CAP has a stable structure that can lead our antimicrobial peptide to the plasmid membrane precisely. What’s more,we changed the original CSP into a shorter version so it won’t affect the activeness of our AAP2 or Bac8c in any chances. &lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;
2. Small and simple: The coding sequence for a CAP is only around 100 base pairs. For E.coli, 100 base pairs is totally within its working capacity. Therefore, E.coli can be a low-cost Bac8c factory, which means more efficient and more product.
