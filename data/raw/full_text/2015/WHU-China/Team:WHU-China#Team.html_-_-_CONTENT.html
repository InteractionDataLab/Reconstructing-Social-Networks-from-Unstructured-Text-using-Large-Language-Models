                My name is Dong Han. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 3 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and especially drawing, and so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team and I want to show our idea with my pen.

                I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice . The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

               I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant trying various things.
I am the people who have curiosity about everything and have the mania in biology studying, the experience in iGEM team is memorable, I love the feeling discussing with other about both the experiments and activities. During my free time, I like watching anime and playing online games.

About me:  Just for fun to join the WHU-iGEM at the beginning, I have never imaged to receive so much surprise in the iGEM family. Too much shock and touch, it seems no word can be used to express my passion and love to my team. It is my first year in iGEM, being a member in the MODEL group, the duty of which is to analyze the results from the biological group. This time,  my task is to simulate the ‘Critical induction system’ by certain model. A challenging task, like a wonderful experience, always makes me exited. Going ahead! I am looking forward to seeing a new word bring from this iGEM trip.  Jin Xiang

Whoever has experience in lab works acknowledges that experiment is a process accompanying with hardships and depending on 

collaborations. Our team persists in building a good relationship and partnership with other teams and strengthening 

regional cooperation constantly. We have tight connections with both the HZAU and the HUST-China team based on the 

advantage of convenient geographical location. Besides, we also collaborate with team Jilin_China on brick-building and 

have established reciprocal relationship also the trust. 


iGEM Team HZAU

We provided team HZAU two plasmids we work with to help them build the part, especially our photosensitive promoter 

successfully function in their program.

iGEM Team Jilin_China

We help the team Jilin_China construct a part，which they used in their program, helping them deliver the plasmid timely. 

Meanwhile, we had a small gathering discussing some practical issues and exchanging ideas about team works.
