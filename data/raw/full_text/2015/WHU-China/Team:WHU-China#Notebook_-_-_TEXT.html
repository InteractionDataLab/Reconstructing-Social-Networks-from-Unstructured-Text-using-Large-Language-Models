DNA counter was mentioned by Wu group firstly. At the same time, there are also two idea mentioned by the other groups.
2015.1-2
During winter vocation, we started brainstorm online to complete our ideas.
2014.3.10
Defense in our group. Before the formal defense, we made a simulation.
2015.3.20
Formal defense. With the help of our advisers and other professors, we had made our final decision. We will keep the idea about DNA counter and treatment of decayed tooth.
2015.3.23
Discussion with our advisers and other professors. Finally, we decided to keep the DNA counter and decayed tooth， but how to combine them properly was still a question.
2015.3.29
Experimental arrangements have been done. We divided all people who would do experiments into three groups——Criticality Detector, binary system group and decayed tooth group.
2015.4.13
Lacking experience, we failed for many times and could not find the reasons. But no one forfeited.

The first human practice is sketching in dish.
Through letting adolescent especially children to doodle with E.coli transformed with GFP and GRP, we taught them simple operation in biological experiment and also the basic knowledge about synthetic biology. After the practice, they knew the iGEM and our program, meanwhile, they developed the interests in future biology studying.
2015.5.23-25
We had to make our best to reach the goal what we expected, so some of us did experiments overnight for several days. But one of the night, power of our lab was cut. We had to stop our experiments and got connect with our lab to store our samples and other materials. The effect lasted for about 3 days, and we cannot do anything those days.

The second human practice, smile mates.
In order to arouse individuals' attention on dental caries prevention, we organized a practice inviting people to do free oral examination and take photos with smile faces. Through the examination and leaflets we made, more people know about the disease, also the iGEM and our team. We got the data about the situation of dental disease, too.

Group meeting. Plasmid construction of Criticality Detector was completed. Function verification of three groups were proceeding.
2015.6.14
Group meeting. In this meeting, we decided who would stayed in the school during summer vocation to finish our project and make a specific plan for the meeting with other groups.
2015.6.20-7.15
Final exams. Every groups stopped experiments for about one month to prepare final exams.
2015.7.29
The third human practice is meets up with other groups.
To enhance the communication among iGEM teams in Wuhan, China and share the experience of project working, Wuhan University held the iGEM Exchange Conference of Central China, inviting the teammates of HUST-China and HZAU-China to discuss each questions in the research, in order to deal with difficulties showing up during the construction of iGEM projects.

Final group meeting. We have finished our plan almost, but there were still some parts unfinished.
During this meeting, we decided details of our uniform and wiki.
2015.9.14
Send parts which we have finished.
