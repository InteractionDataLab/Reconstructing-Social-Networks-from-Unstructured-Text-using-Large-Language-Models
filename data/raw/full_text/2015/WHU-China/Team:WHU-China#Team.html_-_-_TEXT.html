My name is Yun Xue. I’m the leader of team WHU-CHINA 2015.  And I participate in iGEM again, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. My future plans include medical school and potential MD/PhD programs. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to China but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.
Jack Blake, a silent boy who swims in the world of codes like a fish,dreams that one day he can make someone.Meanwhile,he is trying to jump out of one type of dogs named by Chinese students.See, life is full of surprise and I want this team to getwhat he desires because he puts too much heart in this game. Best Wishes.
I’m Jing-cheng Wang from College of Lifesciences in Wuhan University. Participating in iGEM is most exciting and fascinating to me, and I’ve learned a lot through the days. I have interest in various fields, such as music, computer sciences, badminton, etc. You can reach me through jcwang95@qq.com.

I’m Teng Li, the only one who comes from medical college of wuhan university, while I have great passion in synthetic biology and iGEM. I took part in the 2014 iGEM competition as a member from WHU-China, during which was primarily responsible for part of the experiment. This year I do the management with Yun Xue, the leader of our team. Apart from that, I’m in charge of human practice and communication with other teams. Different roles in my two years spent in iGEM taught me totally different things, and I enjoy every detail of that. I like growing up with friends, good luck to every iGEMers!
My name is Dong Han. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 3 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and especially drawing, and so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team and I want to show our idea with my pen.
An Yunyun will be a senior student next semester. She takes notes of everything important of WHU-iGEM during the match, and enjoys it very much. What's more, she is good at plant biology.

I’m Yuanyuan Bie, a freshman majoring in biology. I love doing experiment since I was in junior high school. Also, I love biology, especially in molecular biology and microbiology. So I join in the iGEM. It provide me with a fantastic environment to do what I want. I really enjoy the atmosphere when we are doing experiments and discussing our project. It’s very lucky for me to be a member of 2015-WHU-CHINA. And it’s very lucky for me to get together with all the teammates. 2015-WHU-CHINA, we will do our best for it.
I am a person who cherishes every chance to broaden his horizon, communicate with and learn from others. As a freshman, I’m grateful to the opportunity that iGEM provides to learn about doing a project. Therefore, I strive to participate in most sections of our project and do my best. I enjoy brainstorming with a crowd of people and having new ideas rolling in my mind. Thanks for WHU-CHINA iGEM 2015, I have been set free in mind and therefore learnt a lot.
My name is Yongzhen Hei. I am a member of Wuhan University iGEM team.

My name is Xinwei Luo. I’m one of the lucky students in Wuhan University who devote themselves to biology. I love life; I love life science. And I always keep a curiosity about the nature, which fascinates me with the unique ways they each works. I participate in this festival, getting to know the future of my career and find the spot I can get used to. Not only the harvest of experiment skills but also the spirit of teamwork benefits my personalities and riches my characteristics. I hope this activity can bring me differences. I always want to be better, and this will be one of the starts.

A freshman who dove straight into iGEM team during the first year of college with limited knowledge in synthetic biology experiments I can now handle the molecular cloning. It's huge progress for me! Outside lab I take delight in reading ancient Greece myth as well as running.
Yujie Liu is our youngest team member,and she’s studying Biotechnology in her 2rd year.She’s one of the main members of our team,she paticipates in constructing our main kit.She designed and cloned huge parts of the light-sensing part,also,she takes an active part in our human practice.Out side the lab she enjoys running,learning new things from different career like economy and art,and she’s really a friendly person.
I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice . The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

Hello, I'm Sheng Li, a sophomore student at Wuhan University. I am interested in many things like sports, music, and science. I'm so proud to join WHU-China iGEM team and be a iGEMer. This is surely a good experience for me. By the way, I am a part of the wiki builders, hope you like our wike(^_^).
I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant trying various things. I am the people who have curiosity about everything and have the mania in biology studying, the experience in iGEM team is memorable, I love the feeling discussing with other about both the experiments and activities. During my free time, I like watching anime and playing online games.

About me:  Just for fun to join the WHU-iGEM at the beginning, I have never imaged to receive so much surprise in the iGEM family. Too much shock and touch, it seems no word can be used to express my passion and love to my team. It is my first year in iGEM, being a member in the MODEL group, the duty of which is to analyze the results from the biological group. This time,  my task is to simulate the ‘Critical induction system’ by certain model. A challenging task, like a wonderful experience, always makes me exited. Going ahead! I am looking forward to seeing a new word bring from this iGEM trip.  Jin Xiang Jin—the designer.

I’m Fei Xiong and I ‘m a 3rd year student of College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. I like dancing and reading. It’s my first time to join in iGEM WHU-CHINA team. I became interested in synthetic biology and chose to be an igemer because my roommate was in the team last year and we talk a lot about the iGEM. It’s my honor to join such an interesting and challenging project and work with my energetic and creative teammates.

Collaborations
Whoever has experience in lab works acknowledges that experiment is a process accompanying with hardships and depending on   collaborations. Our team persists in building a good relationship and partnership with other teams and strengthening   regional cooperation constantly. We have tight connections with both the HZAU and the HUST-China team based on the   advantage of convenient geographical location. Besides, we also collaborate with team Jilin_China on brick-building and   have established reciprocal relationship also the trust.
iGEM Team HZAU
We provided team HZAU two plasmids we work with to help them build the part, especially our photosensitive promoter   successfully function in their program.
iGEM Team Jilin_China
We help the team Jilin_China construct a part，which they used in their program, helping them deliver the plasmid timely.   Meanwhile, we had a small gathering discussing some practical issues and exchanging ideas about team works.
