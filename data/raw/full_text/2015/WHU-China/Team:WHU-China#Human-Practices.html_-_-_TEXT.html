3. Discussion
During the discussion, we first shared our difficulties in the experiment and the solutions, such as the efficiency of transformation,  activity of the enzymes. Then we came up with an idea that we could build a platform, where we communicate the up to date findings of synthesis biology, which can give us some clues of the match. Every team leader will take the responsibility to manage the platform in turn. And we can share some efficient technology and agentia for the success of experiments
Secondly, we communicated about the HP. How to find a feasible theme, how to carry out, how to promote the cooperation with other teams, how to present the HP and so on. Every team shared their own methods. For example, the HUST said they cooperated with other colleges and combined it with social work.          Besides, we talked about the digifax. We exchanged our ideas of how to build the model, how to analyze the data, how to distribute the staff.
Finally, we discussed the build of our teams. The management, the scale, the structure of age, the responsibility distribution are all our concerns, which could give a great reference to the next team.         According to this seminar, we gained lots of precious experience, and we held the belief that we were not rivals, but partners. With the help of each other, we could sail more smooth and further in the waved sea of iGEM!
