To enhance the communication among iGEM teams in Wuhan, China and share the experience of project working, Wuhan University held the iGEM Exchange Conference of Central China, inviting the teammates of HUST-China and HZAU-China to discuss each questions in the research, in order to deal with difficulties showing up during the construction of iGEM projects.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member5"><H2 style="display:inline; float:left">Notebook</H2><H2 style="display:inline; float:right">Page 5 of 5</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD>2015.9.7</TD></TR><TR><TD>Final group meeting.
