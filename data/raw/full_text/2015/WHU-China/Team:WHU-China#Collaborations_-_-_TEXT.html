Collaborations
Whoever has experience in lab works acknowledges that experiment is a process accompanying with hardships and depending on collaborations. Our team persists in building a good relationship and partnership with other teams and strengthening regional cooperation constantly. We have tight connections with both the HZAU-China and the HUST-China team based on the advantage of convenient geographical location. Besides, our team also collaborates with team Jilin-China on brick-building and we have established reciprocal relationship as well as the trust.
iGEM Team HZAU-China
We provided team HZAU-China two plasmids BBa_K1647006 & BBa_K769001 we work with to help them build the part, especially our photosensitive promoter successfully function in their program. https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/Team/Attributions https://2015.igem.org/Team:HZAU-China/OutReach/Collaboration
iGEM Team Jilin_China
We helped the team Jilin-China construct a part, which is used in their program, helping them deliver the plasmid timely. We gave them our last year's favorite part BBa_K1334002 , which is a regulator designed by Haoyuan Sun. In order to promote its utility, they repeated the experiments that we did last year and improved it. The promoter we offered them really helped a lot, they said. Meanwhile, we had a small gathering discussing some practical issues and exchanging ideas about team works. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Jilin_China/Collaborations
Wuhan iGEM seminar
During the summer vacation, to enhance the communication between iGEM teams and share the experience of preparation, Wuhan University held the 'Wuhan iGEM seminar', with Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) and Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU).During the discussion, we first shared our difficulties in the experiment and the solutions, such as the efficiency of transformation, activity of the enzymes. Then we came up with an idea that we could build a platform, where we communicate the up to date findings of synthesis biology, which can give us some clues of the match. We discussed other practical issues concerns Human practice, digifax and the management of the team. Every team shared their experience and learned from each other, making this seminar so meaningful.
Attributions to Newsletter
We contributed two manuscripts respectively in the 2nd and the 6th Newsletter sharing our experience we gained and problems we encountered. What's more we introduced our project to the readers. You may find our articles in this website. https://2015.igem.org/Team:Amoy/Newsletter/Links
