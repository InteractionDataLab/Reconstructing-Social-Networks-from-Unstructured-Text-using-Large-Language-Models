Lab Safety
There have always been concerns regarding the safety issues in synthetic biology ever since this subject was born, so it is of high priority for us to establish laboratory safety regulations.
1.Our laboratory is under the supervision of a skillful teacher, Ms.Long.
2.Our laboratory is assessed as a BSL-1 lab equipped with warning signs to designate particular hazards and secure, adequately spaced, well ventilated storage for chemicals.
3.Each member of the team had to sign an application form and to grant their clearance. Therefore, anyone without clearance would be kept away from any potential danger in the lab.
4.All of us were previously trained to be familiar with the procedures conducted in the laboratory. Also, statements that declare we will respect the safety rules were sighed before we get access to the laboratory.
5.Strict rules were set for the cleanliness of the laboratory and the safety related to. Everyone on duty would have to do the cleaning as well as remind others to take adequate precautions if they forget to.  Cleaning work includes sterilizing after experiments and sterilizating any spill of potentially infectious materials with appropriate disinfectant. Precautions include wearing lab coats and gloves, washing hands using anti-bacterial soap both before and after the experiments etc.
6.Environmental safety problems prevention. All waste would be stored in secure containers and all the cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials will be decontaminated using an effective method before disposal.
