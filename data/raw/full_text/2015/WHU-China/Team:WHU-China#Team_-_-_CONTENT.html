My name is Yun Xue. I'm the leader of team WHU-CHINA 2015.
 And I participate in iGEM again, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. My future plans include medical school and potential MD/PhD programs. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to China but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.

I'm Teng Li, the only one who comes from medical college of wuhan university, while I have great passion in synthetic biology and iGEM. I took part in the 2014 iGEM competition as a member from WHU-China, during which was primarily responsible for part of the experiment. This year I do the management with Yun Xue, the leader of our team. Apart from that, I'm in charge of human practice and communication with other teams. Different roles in my two years spent in iGEM taught me totally different things, and I enjoy every detail of that. I like growing up with friends, good luck to every iGEMers!

                My name is Dong Han. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 3 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and especially drawing, and so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team and I want to show our idea with my pen.

                I am MuTianchen and I am a junior student in the school of life science. Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to construct part of the Dental caries prevention circuit and help with the human practice. The work was heavy but also full of fun and inspiration. Me myself is a huge Sci-Fi buff and a fan of Coldplay——so for me the most interesting and relaxing activity outside the lab would be listening to the Violet Hill while traveling in the TARDIS … May the force be with you and enjoy the iGEM!

               I am Yiran Shen, studying for my bachelor degree, as a number of the 2015 iGEM team at Wuhan University I am so exciting because I did a lot of new things and meet with lots of new friends here. At first, I interested in the dental caries, so with my team member we considered different ways to control and even cure the disease. Then I also worked with other to organize the human practice and also asked for the sponsors. During these process, I find myself not only a simply experimenter, but also a creative participant trying various things.
I am the people who have curiosity about everything and have the mania in biology studying, the experience in iGEM team is memorable, I love the feeling discussing with other about both the experiments and activities. During my free time, I like watching anime and playing online games.

About me:  Just for fun to join the WHU-iGEM at the beginning, I have never imaged to receive so much surprise in the iGEM family. Too much shock and touch, it seems no word can be used to express my passion and love to my team. It is my first year in iGEM, being a member in the MODEL group, the duty of which is to analyze the results from the biological group. This time,  my task is to simulate the 'Critical induction system' by certain model. A challenging task, like a wonderful experience, always makes me exited. Going ahead! I am looking forward to seeing a new word bring from this iGEM trip. Jin Xiang Jin—the designer. She was the designer of the whole project gathering information from all subprojects and therefore responsible for designing poster and others promotional materials.
