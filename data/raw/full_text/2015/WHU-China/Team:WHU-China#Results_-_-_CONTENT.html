For the great convenience this strategy could bring, we decided to show it in our result. Advantages are listed below:</SPAN><SPAN>1.It saves a lot of time from molecular cloning. Teams of iGEM always spend a lot of time on the digestion with restriction endonuclease to obtain the target DNA and the ligation to construct a composite part. Also, adding a tag to a basic part using ordinary overlap PCR requires the subsequent reconstruction of all the composite parts containing that basic part. However, with the assistance of our PCR strategy, teams are able to get a whole plasmid ready to be transformed after the insertion at a predefined site.</SPAN><SPAN>2. It enables the insertion of a relatively long DNA segment. The site-directed mutagenesis could be used for insertion in a whole plasmid, but the insertion is merely several base pairs long. Our PCR strategy is proved to insert a DNA segment (i.e. the 46-bp long CI binding site) which is longer than what the site-directed mutagenesis could provide. Theoretically speaking, it could even afford insertion of longer DNA segments. </SPAN><SPAN>We successfully inserted the CI binding site into the specific site after failed many times with the ordinary assembly strategy.</SPAN><SPAN>Step1:The first pair of primers are adjacent to each other with opposite direction. After amplification by PCR,  circular plasmids are “opened” at a specific cite of interest and linear plasmids are obtained (see Fig.1). </SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:210px">Fig.1 The first pair of primers &quot;open&quot; the circular plasmid at a specific cite. </SPAN><SPAN>This step could not be omitted according to our result. RFP with promoter on pSB1C3 was selected to test the necessity of this step. With the help of specially designed primers for step1 and step2, a 37-bp segment would be inserted into the middle of the promoter, which would prevent the colony from becoming red. E. coli transformed with plasmids produced by a two-step PCR was grown on the left plate; E. coli transformed with plasmids produced by an one-step PCR (without step1) was grown on the right plate (see Fig.2). Results showed that most insertion failed without the first step while most insertion succeeded with a two-step strategy, which demonstrated the significance of the first step.</SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:210px">Fig.2 Efficient insertion requires the first step. </SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member9"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">CI Binding Site Insertion_A Brand-new PCR Strategy</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 9 of 16</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>On the left, most colonies were red indicating the aborted insertion by the one-step PCR (without step1); on the right, most colonies lost their color for the successful insertion by the two-step PCR.</SPAN><SPAN>Step2:The second pair of primers is for insertion of the DNA segment and back-splicing of the linear plasmid. The pair of primers not only respectively overlaps with both terminus of the linear product of the first step, but also overlaps with each other to back splice the linear plasmid. Thus the insertion is completed and the product of the reaction becomes circular plasmids ready to be transformed into competent cells.</SPAN><SPAN>It is noteworthy that the second pair of primers in our PCR strategy doesn’t need to be complementary to each other. The gap shown below (see Fig.4) could be filled by DNA polymerase and therefore, the length of both the forward and reverse primer could be reduced to nearly one-half of the DNA segment for insertion. In such a way, price for primers synthesis could be reduced too.</SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:210px">Fig.4 Only a small overlap is adequate for the second pair of primers.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member10"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Application: Targeted Antimicrobial Peptides AAP2&amp;Bac8c</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 10 of 16</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>Curing through synthetic biology has been a hot issue for a long time. Since one of our team mem-ber was troubled by dental caries since very young, and since our criticality detector can be used to control doses of some strong medicine precisely by receiving complicated input signal and transfer it into a simple one. So to prove this property creatively, we construct an antimicrobial peptide pro-ducing circuit which is helpful for dental caries prevention and homeostasis maintenance. </SPAN><SPAN>To be specific, when the concentration of Streptococcus mutans increase to a certain level, the criticality detector can activate the expression of targeted antimicrobial peptide to inhibit the growth of S.mutans, controlling its population in oral cavity under a healthy level.</SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:410px">Fig.4 Only a small overlap is adequate for the second pair of primers.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member11"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Mechanism of our Targeted antimicrobial peptides</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 11 of 16</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>Antimicrobial peptides are recently regarded as a promising choice to kill microbes due to their strong microbicidal effects and their unlikeliness of triggering resistance in microorganisms. Since there are also various kinds of probiotics living in our mouth besides oral pathogens, and since antimicrobial peptides have effect on general kinds of microorganisms, it’s more wise to modify the antimicrobial peptide into a targeted one by adding a S.mutans targeted sequence on the N-terminal, so that only S.mutans can be killed selectively. Thus we design two fused peptides, CAP-glyglygly-Bac8c and CAP-glyglygly-AAP2, to targetedly inhibit the growth of S.mutans in oral cavity, where CAP is an optimized peptide that can specifically bind to the comD receptor on the surface of S.mutans, while Bac8c and AAP2 are two kinds of peptides that assume strong bactericidal effect in acidic environment.

Effect of AAP2 on E.coli under different pH</SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:210px">After being cultured to OD=600, E.coli containing Pet28a-AAP2 are induced with 1.0mM IPTG and the pH of the bacterial solution is adjusted to either pH=5 or pH=7 by adding hydrochloric acid. Then the OD of the solution is analyzed every 30 minutes, and the result are as follows:</SPAN><SPAN style="margin-top:210px">From the picture we can see that with the induction of IPTG, E.coli's growth is strongly inhibited af-ter 5.5 hours, indicating that AAP2 is an effective antimicrobial peptide. However, the inhibition ef-fect of AAP2 are similar between groups pH7 and pH5, indicating that AAP2 may not be an acid activated antimicrobial peptide.</SPAN><SPAN>Nevertheless, considering that the pH of the external environment is much easier to change than that of the inner cell environment (because of the homeostasis of E.coli), and since AAP2, after in-duction, is expressed and takes effects inside E.coli, we can't say that the pH change of the exter-nal environment will indeed affect the structure of AAP2 inside E.coli, and thus we can't deny it that AAP2 may have stronger inhibiting effect at lower pH. Further experiment should be conducted to prove our guess, where the expressed AAP2 will be purified and artificially added to an E.coli cul-ture, so that the AAP2 can take effect from the outside of the cell.</SPAN><SPAN>However, according to the result we get, it's one thing for sure that AAP2 has antimicrobial effect under pH7.</SPAN><SPAN>B.

SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN>To detect the antimicrobial peptides expressed by E.coli (BL21), we collected 70mL sample from each group of the Turbidimetry experiment above after inuction for 240min.

However the samples were also tested for the Kirby–Bauer antibiotic testing, which confirmed the existence and the function of our peptides. So here are several possible reasons:
The relative molecular mass of those peptides are no more than 2kD, which is very difficult to dis-tinguish on the gel. Besides the band intensity of other proteins are very light, indicating that the concentration of our sample may be very low, making it even harder to identify the band of antimi-crobial peptide.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member15"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Function Testing Experiments</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 15 of 16</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN><STRONG>3.Kirby–Bauer antibiotic testing</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN>To confirm the existence and the function of our antimicrobial peptides, we conducted the experiment using the bacterial lysis solutions we had collected earlier :</SPAN><SPAN>Using an aseptic technique, place a sterile glass rod onto the culture of E.coli and then gently streak the Mueller-Hinton agar plate to form a bacterial lawn.To obtain uniform growth, streak the plate with the glass rod to and fro, meanwhile rotate the plate 90° and streak the plate again and again.
Allow the plate to dry for approximately 5 minutes.
Using an Antibiotic Disc Dispenser to dispense discs containing our antimicrobial peptide and also sterile water onto different plates.
Using a flame-sterilized forceps, gently press each disc to the agar to ensure that the disc is at-tached to the agar.
Plates should be incubated overnight at an incubation temperature of 37 °C for 16 hours.

Through this, we could find that comparing with negative control (sterile water) in plate C, even not that clearly, the diameters of zones of inhibition are larger. Because the antibacterial effect of ethanol is not prominent, the diameter in plate C are small.
</SPAN><SPAN>Comparing plate A with D, since AAP2 should have stronger effect under low pH, and the results show that the diameter in A are larger than D, indicating that under low pH environment the AAP2 are more effective.</SPAN><SPAN>Comparing plate B with E, we test whether CAP may have influence on the bacteriostasis of Bac8c. Based on our assumption, CAP have a special function on pinpointing Streptococcus. mutans, and the fusion of CAP cannot interfere Bac8c. This picture shows that the existence of CAP do not influence the diameter of the zone of inhibition, proving our assumption.</SPAN><SPAN>Despite the fact that our experiment may have some flaws, we can still make a simple conclusion that these antimicrobial peptide indeed have bacteriostasis, and they can work under different con-ditions.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member16"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Conclusions</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 16 of 16</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>We tested the function of our antimicrobial peptides in E. coli through Turbidimetry, SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis and Kirby–Bauer antibiotic testing.

</SPAN><H2>Future Expectations</H2><SPAN>Unfortunately we didn’t get to test our antimicrobial peptides on S.mutans, so we hope that we could conduct more tests and collect more data in the future with a system based on S. mutans, our primary target. What’s more, we hope that we could transfer the plasmids into the S.mutans  so the antimicrobial peptides could be delivered directly into the biofilm on the surface of the teeth that may suffer dental caries. It means we need to find more S.mutans compatible plasmids and more environment-sensitive promotors In the future.</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
