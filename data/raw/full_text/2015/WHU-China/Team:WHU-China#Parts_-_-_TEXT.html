Figure: Criticality part This part function as the output of light sensing. It is composed of three independent parts which are leaded by three promoter seperately, the three parts are CI operator site, CI protein after riboregulator, and taRNA. When the promoter PompC is activated (usually when red light turns off), these three sequences express at the same time: the CI operator site, the riboregulator, and the taRNA. First, because of the riboregulator, the CI repressor can not be produced. But then, when taRNA is expressed integrally, it works to unlock the riboregulator, so the CI protein starts to be produced. Last, the CI protein bind to the CI operator site, and exact its function, so the following sequence is depressed, including its own sequence. To summarize the function of this part, it makes the expression of CI repressor limited to a relatively short period of time: at first it can't be produced, once it can be expressed and exact its function, it's inhibited by itself.
Figure: Light sensitive part This part is built for light sensing. It can regulate the promoter PompC, thus used for signal input in our project. It encodes three proteins, Cph8, Ho1 and PcyA. Cph8 is a hybrid photoreceptor, composed of photoreceptor Cph1 and the EnvZ histidine kinase. Ho1 and PcyA are enzymes which catalyze heme to phycocyanobilin (PCB). Cph8 requires covalently associated PCB to function. PompC is blocked when Cph8 is exposed under red light and is actived under far-red light.
