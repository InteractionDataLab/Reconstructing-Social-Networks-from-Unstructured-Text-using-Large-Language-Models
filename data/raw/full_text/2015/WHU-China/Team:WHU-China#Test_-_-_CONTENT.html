     Our model is to check whether the circuit is right or not, first of all, we try to figure out all the factors which would have an impact on this circuit and the connections among all the factors.

Principal factor analysis on the basis of principal component analysis</H3><SPAN>
We can figure out the optimal influenced component of the output by modeling on the basis of principal factor analysis </SPAN><SPAN>1. Teaching evaluation model based on principal component analysis</SPAN><SPAN>Principal component analysis is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. </SPAN><SPAN>As each variable reflects some information of the research more or less, and there is some correlation between the indicators, the information we can get from the statistics are overlapped to some extent.</SPAN><SPAN>Therefore, principal component analysis makes use of the ideas of dimension reduction, which can help retain the original data and minimize the loss of information. It reduces dimension of the high-dimensional variable space so that the original variable system can be integrated and simplified to the largest extent. In addition, it can objectively determine the weight of each indicator parameters, which avoids subjective judgment brought by randomness. </SPAN><SPAN>On the basis of the original data, we can use principal component analysis to discard some information through linear transformation and then to find out composite indicator made of a combination of several indicators that are also called main ingredients. These components can reflect the characteristics of the original index and they are independent from each other. 
</SPAN><SPAN>Set the original vector as
and the main components obtained through principal component analysis as    
,
which are linear combination of  
.
Coordinate system composed of   
is obtained by translating the original coordinate system and orthogonal rotation. We call the space dimension of   
the primary hyperplane.
</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member3"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Modeling</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 3 of 7</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>
On this main hyperplane, the largest variation in the data is the first principal component  

.For  

we have

in turn. As a result 

can reflect most information of the original data, which implies that the main hyperplane with m dimensions is the very subspace with m dimensions which can retain the original data information to the largest extent.
</SPAN><SPAN>
The followings are the steps of principal component analysis.
</SPAN><SPAN>
(1)Firstly, normalize the original data to eliminate the impact brought by different magnitudes and dimensions. The formula used is as follows.
   
\[\begin{equation}\label{equation1}x'_{ij}=\frac{(x_{ij}-\overline{x_i})}{\delta_i}(i=1,2,\cdots,p; j=1,2,\cdots,n)\end{equation}\]

Where    

means the original data of the jth sample of the ith indicator.

and  
respectively implies the mean and standard deviation of samples of the ith indicator.
</SPAN><SPAN>(2)Through the normalized data sheet
,
we can further calculate the correlation coefficient R with the formula 

Where 
</SPAN><SPAN>
(3)Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of R. And according to the characteristic equation 

we can obtain the characteristic root 

and place it in descending order

we can get the corresponding feature vector

 which are standard orthogonal. We call

spindle. And I mentioned above means the unit matrix.
</SPAN><SPAN>
(4) Calculate the contribution rate and the cumulative contribution rate
</SPAN><SPAN>
(5)Calculate the principal component 
</SPAN><SPAN>where the principal components are independent from each other.
</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member4"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Modeling</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 4 of 7</H2><DIV class="member"><SPAN>
（6）Comprehensive analysis. 
In order to retain as much of the original data information, we should take into consideration how much precision is needed to replace the original variable system with the m-dimension hyperplane. We can make judgment through the cumulative contribution rate 

and decide on the dimension of hyperplane m when  

and when m can satisfy the condition that 

And then we can make further analysis on the principal components extracted.

</SPAN><SPAN>
（7）
Finally, according to the principal components after principal component analysis and the corresponding weights

 we can calculate the comprehensive indicator which reflects characteristics of air polluting.
</SPAN><SPAN>
As the data information implying parameters of indicators has basically been reflected in the principal components, we can say that the comprehensive indicator W has already included the basic characteristics of teaching evaluation from these parameters in different aspects.
</SPAN><H2>Statistical test system for principal component analysis</H2><SPAN>
No denying that the principal component analysis is not appropriate for all sample data. Generally speaking, the method can be used to simplify data structure and to make further analysis in practical problems. Hence, principal component analysis has certain preconditions. Principal component analysis is a good choice only when variables of the original data have strong linear relationship. That is to say, when we find not enough degree of linear correlation among the original variables, it is not reasonable for us to use the principal component analysis as we can not simplify the data structure in this case. Therefore, we should test the applicability of raw data before the application of principal component analysis
</SPAN><H3>1.Bartlett test of sphercity </H3><SPAN>Bartlett test of sphercity is one of the commonly used statistical test methods. It is a test of the entire correlation matrix and the null hypothesis is that the correlation matrix is unit matrix. And when we can not reject the null hypothesis, we can say that the original variables are independent from each other, which means that it is not suitable to use the principal component analysis method[4].</SPAN><SPAN>
We can also calculate significance level P value based on the statistic testing formula. When P value is less than 0.05, we should reject the null hypothesis, indicating that principal component analysis can be applied to the original data. On the contrary, if the probability P value is larger than 0.05, the main component analysis is no longer applicable.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="editarea" id="member5"><H2 style="display:inline;float:left">Modeling</H2><H2 style="display:inline;float:right">Page 5 of 7</H2><DIV class="member"><H3>2 KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) test</H3><SPAN>
KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) test is used to compare the simple correlation coefficient with partial correlation coefficient between the comparison variables. It is used mainly in the main factor analysis of multivariate statistics. KMO statistic is a value between 0 and 1. When the sum of the squares of simple correlation coefficient between the variables is larger than that of partial correlation coefficient, KMO value is close to 1, which means that the correlation between variables is strong and the original variable is suitable for factor analysis. Similarly, when the sum of the squares of simple correlation coefficient between the variables is close to zero, KMO value is close to zero, which means that the correlation between variables is weak and the original variable is not suitable for factor analysis.
The formula for KMO test is as follows.

Here rij represents the simple correlation coefficient and 

represents the partial correlation coefficients. When 

 KMO value is always between 0 and 1. And when 

 we can use the principal component analysis.
