Week 6
08/09/15
Miniprepped the liquid cultures from lldd_ IDT, 4 tubes.
Resuspended RFP in PCSB1C3 backbone (shipping plasmid)  from distribution kit in 10uL nuclease-free water ( Plate 4, well 4B)
Transformed 2 tubes with RFP backbones to amplify, 4uL plasmid per tube.
Plated on 2 plates, 100uL mixture per plate. The plates were plates in the incubator
Also performed the digestion and ligation : Promoter + LLD on AmpR.
4 separate tubes of ligation product, labelled P+LLD ligate 1-4 is in the freezer box
tubes 1 and 2 were ligated to Amna’s AmpRbackbone
tubes 3 and 4 were ligated to Amna’s AmpRbackone 2
09/09/2015
Transformed Pro +lldd contruct ( AmpR). The 4 plates are in the incubator
Miniprepped the Pro+ TnaA contruct ( KanR). The 6 tubes are in the freezer box, the average concentration is 20ng/uL
Digestion And Ligation
We followed the standard digestion and ligation protocol
Join Pr +TnaA to TnaB + Ter and put on both pSBC13 and AmpR backbone
Used tubes 4,5,6, from Pro+TnaA miniprep from 9/09
We halved the volumes of digestion procedure to give total digest volume of 25uL.
10/09/2015
Picked the colonies of the tnaA and lldd  and inoculated the final construct on AmpR backbone and shipping plasmid
11/09/2015
Miniprepped the final construct on AmpR backbone and shipping plasmid
12/09/2015
Switched the final construct of tnaA and lldd onto shipping plasmid
Week 7
13/09/2015
Transformation of shipping constructs lldd and tnaA  onto shipping plasmid using previous standard protocol
Created 4 replicates for each
14/09/2015
picked the white colonies and inoculated the liquid cultures following standard protocol
15/09/2015
miniprepped the final construct for shipping
