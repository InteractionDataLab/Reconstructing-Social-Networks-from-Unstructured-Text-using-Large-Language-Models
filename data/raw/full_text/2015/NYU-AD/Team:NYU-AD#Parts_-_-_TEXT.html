This collection of parts represents the first step of the team's effort towards engineering E. coli to attract, kill, and digest mosquitoes. L-lactic acid and indole were identified as effective chemical attractants of mosquitoes through literature review, and L-lactate dehydrogenase as well as tryptophanases A and B were identified as key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis pathways of the attractants.
Due to time constraints, we acquired sequences for these enzymes from biological databases and modified their sequence so as to make them RFC10 compatible, then had them synthesized by IDT through the free DNA synthesis offer for iGEM teams. This synthesis process gave us coding sequences in a Biobrick compatible format, which we then used to carry out a series of 3A assembly steps to attach constitutive promoter and RBS sequences, as well as to append a terminator. The promoter, RBS, and terminator sequences were acquired from the iGEM Biobrick part registry. The end result of these assembly steps are the 2 composite parts BBa_K1867023 and BBa_K1867024.
All of the basic parts we got synthesized were added to the registry and documented. However, we did not send DNA samples of these parts to iGEM HQ because time constraints prevented us from placing them on the pSB1C3 backbones. Both composite parts were documented on the registry and submitted as DNA samples.
