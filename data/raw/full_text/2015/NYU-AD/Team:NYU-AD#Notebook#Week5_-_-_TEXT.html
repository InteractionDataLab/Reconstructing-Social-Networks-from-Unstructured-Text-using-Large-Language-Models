Week 5
30/08/15
We made liquid broth and added Kanamycin and Amp, 500ml for each ( see standard procedures)
noculated individual colonies in LB broth with respective antibiotic of tnaa and tnab. However, we accidentally switched antibiotics so there was only 1 tube of each of the parts.  Left to incubate in shaking incubator at 37˚C.
31/08/2015
Miniprepped the tnaA and tnaB cultures from IDT (see standard QIAprep protocol)
The large centrifuge was broken, so the cultures were spun down in Eppendorf tubes per large tube.
Completed a Nanodrop . Results shown below:
Completed the digestion and ligation of the tnaA
Transformed the cells
28/08/2015
We received the tnaa and the tnab tubes from IDT on the 26/08/15
Resuspended the tnaa and the tnab sequence by adding 200ul of water ( DNAse and RNAase free) into each tube.
29/08/2015
Nanodropped the DNA to verify the concentration of resuspended DNA. The Nuclease-free water that was used to reuspend the DNA was found to be contaminated with 4.8ng/ul of DNA. The actual DNA content of the plasmids is around 6-8ng/ul on average.
We still proceeded with the transformation of the DNA since the protocol specified 10ug-1000ug of DNA.

Digestion:
Aim: To put the promoter and RBS upstream of tnaA
Digestion:
double digest, total volume- 50uL ( followed standard protocol exactly)
Ligation:
Triple ligation, total vol. -20uL:
5ul of digest x3 ( upstream, downstream, destination plasmid)
2uL of 10x buffer
1ul of T4 ligase
2ul of water
Remainder of the protocol was standard protocol of ligation
Transformation:
Followed the Eb-5α protocol exactly (heat shocked the cells at 42˚C for 45 seconds)
Did duplicate tubes, streaking on separate plates.
02/09/15
Checked the plates, but there were very few white colonies present, so we discarded them
Hence, we redid the digestion and ligation of tnaA (standard protocol, see 31/08/15) to be sure.
Digestion:
Promoter + RBS – cut with EcoRI + Spel
TnaA- cut with Xbal + PstI
RFP backbone – cut with EcoRI + PstI
Ligation:
We made duplicates
Verified the ligation by running it through electrophoresis gel before transforming.
Gel: agarose, 100V
Lanes L-R: T1, T2, RFP, ladder. The T1 and T2 sample bands were slower than RFP. Proceeded with transformation
Transformation:
transformed in duplicate ( 2 tubes) up to outgrowth step
The agar plates in the incubator. 2 plates were placed in the incubator and 2 were placed in the shaking incubator.
03/09/15
Checked the plates, there was no growth. Redoing transformation.
4 tubes, 2.5uL of ligation mixture each
Heat shock at 42˚C of 45seconds
4 tubes in shaker.
03/09/15
Out of the 4 tubes, 3 were found to be red, only 1 white.
Hence, we miniprep the 1 tube. We also streaked a plate with the culture from the tube, in case the miniprep does not work.
We also replated some colonies by inoculating them in liquid culture for 30mins and streaking them onto plates, in hope of getting some white colonies. There were 3 plates, labelled with blue marker, placed in the incubator at 1146h

The results show that while the ratio of DNA to other substances is high ( i.e. the DNA is pure), there is very little amount of DNA in the minipreps.
We also inoculated the lldd from IDT that we received.
