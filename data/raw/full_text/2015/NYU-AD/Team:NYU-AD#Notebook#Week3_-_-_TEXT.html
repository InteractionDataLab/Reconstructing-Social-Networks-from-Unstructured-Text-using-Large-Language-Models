Week 3
26/07/2015
The 3 transformation tubes containing Promoter2 + Ampicillin, Promoter3+Ampicillin, Promoter1+ Ampicillin, are still clean so we proceeded to discard them.
After centrifuging the tubes, all the Terminator in Ampicillin tubes have white pellets except Ter2 tube (diluted), which had a red pellet. Hence we discarded Ter2 tube.
We performed the Miniprep on the other 5 tubes with white pellets.
Then performed digestion and ligation on the plasmids using standard protocols.
Then we transformed the DNA into competent cells
Ligation
Exception for the ligation:
We added 5ul of each digest and ccdb backbone
2ul of DNA ligase
4ul of buffer solution but no water
This was spun down for 10 seconds in the centrifuge.
Transformation:
The transformation was done according to standard protocol
However, for step 7, tube 1& 3 are placed in the normal incubator at 37˚C and at 130rpm
However, for step 7, tube 1& 3 are placed in the normal incubator at 37˚C and at 130rpm
We created 2 duplicates of transformation plate for each tube.

We did not use the correct restriction enzymes on the ccdb cells; hence we had to re-do the ligation and digestion of the plasmids. See above for the protocol ( for the 26/07/15)
We then followed with the transformation of the plasmids by transforming 5ul each of the transformed plasmids in each tube of the competent cell
Transformation:
The transformation was followed according to standard protocol, with the exception of  certain steps:
Heat shock the cells at 42˚C.
The cells were placed on ice for 3 instead of 5 minutes
Pipette 900ul of S.O.C. mixture
The tubes were shaken in the heating block at 37˚C, at 250rpm.

For the stock concentration of antibiotic:
we need 50ug/mL of Chloroamphenciol ( from earlier documentation)
target conc: 50uh/mL
target conc: 50uh/mL
So we have 300ml of LB and our final conc. needs to be 50ug/mL. Hence we measure out 6mg of antibiotic into the broth.
So We added 330ul of antibiotic ( of stock concentration 100mg/mL) into 300ml of LB Broth, then pipetted 10ml into each test tube.
Picked colonies from each plate, inoculated them and left them in the incubator at 250rpm.
29/07/2015
Miniprepped the plasmids but we accidentally threw out 2 test tubes of DNA but we still had 4 duplicates left.
We then performed a Nanodrop of the ChiA constructs

Performed ligation of the promoter and tnaA
Amplifying the tnaA and tnaB sequence.
Added 200ul of water (DNA- RNA free) into each tube
Performed the Nano Drop . The concentration of both tubes is approximately 7-8ug/ul.
27/08/2015
Nanodrop to verify concentration of resuspended  DNA
Nuclease- free H2O used to resuspend the DNA  was found to be contaminated with 4.8ug/ul of DNA
The actual DNA content of plasmids are around 6-8 ug/ul on average
We decided to proceed with the transformation since protocol specified 10ug- 100ug of DNA.
30/08/2015
We made liquid broth, Kanamycin
Preparing agar plates:
Take 35g of agar powder in 1L of solution.
Add the powder then autoclave the solution( 1hour)
We already have antibiotic stock solution of 100mg/ml
Note: Due to coagulation, we had to put in 400ul of antibiotic( chloroamphenicol) instead of 500ul as originally desired.
