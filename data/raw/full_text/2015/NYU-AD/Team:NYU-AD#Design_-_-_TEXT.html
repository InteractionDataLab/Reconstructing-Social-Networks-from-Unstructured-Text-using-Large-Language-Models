Mosquito Trap Documentation
Video
Our video attempts to summarize the entire process of designing and assembling the mosquito trap in under two minutes. Starting from scratch, using a bottle of Pepsi, it follows a simple path that results in an effective, functioning mosquito trap.
Note: Although it may seem as if the petri dish contains our bacterial culture, this is not the case. The bio parts were shipped in advance so the petri dish simply contains a liquid for simulation purposes.
3D Rendered Model
The 3D model was designed on SolidWorks for the purpose of visualizing what our prototype may have looked like. However, after further consideration, the decision was made to use the concept of the bottle of Pepsi which worked almost ideally with our project.
