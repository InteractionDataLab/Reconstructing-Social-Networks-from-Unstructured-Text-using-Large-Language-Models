Week 4
26/08/15
Performed ligation of the promoter and tnaA
Amplifying the tnaA and tnaB sequence. .
Added 200ul of water (DNA- RNA free) into each tube
Performed the Nano Drop . The concentration of both tubes is approximately 7-8ug/ul.
27/08/2015
Nanodrop to verify concentration of resuspended  DNA
Nuclease- free H2O used to resuspend the DNA  was found to be contaminated with 4.8ug/ul of DNA
The actual DNA content of plasmids are around 6-8 ug/ul on average
We decided to proceed with the transformation since protocol specified 10ug- 100ug of DNA.
28/08/2015
We received the tnaa and the tnab tubes from IDT on the 26/08/15
Resuspended the tnaa and the tnab sequence by adding 200ul of water ( DNAse and RNAase free) into each tube.
29/08/2015
Nanodropped the DNA to verify the concentration of resuspended DNA. The Nuclease-free water that was used to reuspend the DNA was found to be contaminated with 4.8ng/ul of DNA. The actual DNA content of the plasmids is around 6-8ng/ul on average.
We still proceeded with the transformation of the DNA since the protocol specified 10ug-1000ug of DNA.
