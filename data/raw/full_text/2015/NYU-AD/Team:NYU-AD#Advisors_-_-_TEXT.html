Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani
Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, USA) in Cell and Molecular Biology. He joined Prof. Jack Szostak’s group at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he studied catalytic RNAs for his postdoctoral work. Following completion of his postdoctoral work, he moved to Center for Cancer Systems Biology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as a Group Leader where he developed a number of high throughput platforms for exploration of the coding and metabolic potential of human and model organism genomes. Salehi-Ashtiani joined New York University Abu Dhabi in 2011 as an Associate Professor of Biology. His group aims to define the metabolic potential of eukaryotic genomes and use this information to identify strategies for improving bioproduct production in algal systems, as well as to remediate metabolic perturbations associated with human disease states.
Joseph Koussa
Joseph Koussa was a Lab Instructor at the Lebanese American University for three years, has done his masters in Molecular biology and is currently teaching the Foundation of Sciences lab series at NYUAD. Previous research was focused on yeast genetics and proteomics mainly Candida albicans and is currently involved in protein biochemistry research at Dr. Wael Rabeh’s lab.
Kenan Jijakli
Kenan Jijakli has a formal education in Engineering where his interest in bioremediation of waste fostered a deeper interest in biology. He later received a fellowship at New York University and New York University in Abu Dhabi that he spent studying and researching synthetic biology, genomics and molecular biology. He is currently a researcher at the Laboratory for Algal, Systems and Synthetic Biology at New York University in Abu Dhabi where he works on diverse projects that range from microfluidics to basic molecular biology.
