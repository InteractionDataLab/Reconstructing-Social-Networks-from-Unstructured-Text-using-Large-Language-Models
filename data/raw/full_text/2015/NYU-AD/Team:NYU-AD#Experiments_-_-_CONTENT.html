The soluble fraction may be assayed directly.
</P><P>Serum samples (0.5-10 μL/assay) can be assayed directly by adding in duplicate to 96 well plate. If lactate dehydrogenase activity is present, samples should be deproteinized with a 10kDa MWCO spin filter.</P><P>Bring samples to final volume of 50 μL/well with Lactate Assay Buffer. </P><P>For unknown samples, it is suggested to test several sample volumes to make sure the readings are within the standard curve range. </P><P>Note: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) will degrade lactate. There, samples containing LDH (such as culture medium or tissue lysate) should be kept -80 degrees Celsius for storage, and filtered through a 10kDa cut-off spin filter.
