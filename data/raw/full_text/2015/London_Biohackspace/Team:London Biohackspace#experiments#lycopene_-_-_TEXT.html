EXPRESSING LYCOPENE IN E.COLI AND S. CEREVISIAE
Introduction
The BioBrick encoding the (S. cerevisiae codon-optimised) Miraculin protein coding sequence will be synthesized and ligated into a pSB1C3 plasmid prior to submission to the iGEM registry. Once this part has been synthesized, we aim to use the SureVector expression vector assembly kit to create a plasmid capable of expressing the Miraculin protein. In order to achieve this we will need to PCR amplify the coding sequence from the pSB1C3 plasmid to create a sequence containing the required SureVector overlap sequences. This DNA fragment can then be used as our gene of interest during the SureVector plasmid assembly process. The assembled expression vector will also contain a yeast autonomous replication sequence (yARS) as well as a LEU2 auxotrophic marker to allow for expression in Leucine deficient strains of S. cerevisiae. Expression of the gene will be regulated through the use of the S. cerevisiae X-Gal Galactose inducible promoter provided with the SureVector kit. The SureVector expression plasmid also contains a His-tagging sequence that we can use to characterise Miraclin expression once a yeast strain has be transformed with the plasmid.
