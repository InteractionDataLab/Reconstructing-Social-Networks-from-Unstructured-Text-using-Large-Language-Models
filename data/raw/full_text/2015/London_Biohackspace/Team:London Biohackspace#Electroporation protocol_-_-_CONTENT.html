This protocol is based on the Eppendorf application note for Escherichia coli DH5α.
</P><P>Most of this protocol is supposed to be done between 2 and 4C, so its important to prepare the items and move quite quickly through the steps.

Escherichia coli DH5α Electroporation transformation protocol
Prepare overnight cultures (for use ~8 hours later)
Put required items on ice
Prepare petri dishes
Prepare 3 LB and 3 LBA plates

Washing Solution
Ice-cold water
Recovery Medium
SOC (or LB+glucose)
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Prepare_overnight_cultures_.28for_use_.7E8_hours_later.29">Prepare overnight cultures (for use ~8 hours later)</SPAN></H2><P>Step 1) Take 2 new/sterile 50ml  falcon tubes and add to each 10ml of sterile LB broth.
</P><P>(there is usually an autoclaved 1 L duran flask of LB in the fridge, use 20ml from that and transfer to tubes under the flow hood)
</P><P>
Step 2) inoculate the 2 falcon tubes from DH5α stock using a flamed loop.
</P><P>
Step 3)  Incubate at 37 °C with shaking overnight, or for 8 hours
</P><P>Step 4) It should look something like this

</P><P>It is also useful to have ice cold RO water, chill before starting
</P><P>�
Prepare petri dishes
</P><P>Prepare 3 LB and 3 LBA plates
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Making_electrocompetent_cells:">Making electrocompetent cells:</SPAN></H2><P>Step 1) Setup an ice bath that will hold several 250ml flasks and the RO water bottle. You will need to use it regularly.
Remember to return the water bottle to the ice bath between steps
</P><P>Step 2) Autoclave 2 x 250ml Duran flasks each containing 90 ml LB medium (leave the lids loose during autoclaving, as trapped gas might cause an autoclave explosion)
</P><P>Allow the flasks to cool to room temperature (or cool under running water)
</P><P>Step 3) Inoculate the flasks by pouring in the 10 ml of the overnight culture from the falcon tube into each to make up to 100ml. 
</P><P>Step 4) Place in the incubator at 37 °C with shaking  
</P><P>Grow to an OD600 of approximately 0.5. The culture turbidity should look roughly like this
</P><P>After removing from the incubator, chill both flasks in an ice bath for 15 minutes 
</P><P>Transfer from the 2 flasks into prechilled falcon tubes.
</P><P>When done the 2 flasks should fill 4 falcon tubes completely.
</P><P>Harvest by 20 minutes at 5000 rpm in the JOUAN centrifuge. A pellet should form in the bottom of the tube. 
</P><P>Pour off the supernatant from each tube, taking care not to dislodge the pellet.
</P><P>Resuspend the pellet by adding 5 ml ice-cold water to each falcon tube and pipette mixing.
</P><P>Mix the 4 x 5ml resuspended cultures into a single falcon tube. (This saves repeating all the steps for each tube)
</P><P>Wash the cells by pelleting and resuspending 3 times:
</P><P>3 times:
Pelleting by 12 minutes centrifugation at 5000 rpm. (Use a counter balancing tube.) Then resuspend the pellet in 45 ml of ice-water
</P><P>
Finally resuspend the cells in ice-cold water to a final concentration of approximately 2 x 10^11 cells/ml. (This is usually just a drop or 2-3ml of liquid)
</P><P>It looks something like this;
</P><P>
Electroporation of cells: 
</P><P>Step 1) Add 90 µl electrocompetent cells  to a prechilled cuvette.
</P><P>Step 2) Add 10 µl of plasmid to cuvette and mix by pipette mixing
</P><P>Step 3) plate out a -ve control of e-competent cells. Mark plate “LBA/E-comp”
</P><P>Step 4) Wipe moisture from the cuvette and insert the cuvette into the device. 
</P><P>Electroporation: Use the following parameters
Mode Prokaryotes
Voltage (V) 1,700 V 
Time constant (τ) 5 ms 
</P><P>Step 5 Immediately add 1 ml recovery medium (SOC or LB+glucose) into the cuvette. Pipette mix to ensure cells can access media.
</P><P>Step 6) Incubate 30- 60 minutes with moderate shaking at 37 °C. 
</P><P>Put the cuvette containing the Cells and the SOC in the incubator for 30-60 mins at 37C
</P><P>Step 7) Plate on LBA. Grow overnight.
</P><P>Expected results: Transformation efficiency up to 3 x 109 transformants/µg of DNA.
