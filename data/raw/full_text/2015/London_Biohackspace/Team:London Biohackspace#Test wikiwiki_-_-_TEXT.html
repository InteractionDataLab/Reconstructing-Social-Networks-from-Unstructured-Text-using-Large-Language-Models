Team:London Biohackspace/Test wikiwiki
Template:Group
We are the biohacking or DIY biology ( Official FAQ about DIY-Biology ) group at the London Hackspace, a mix of amateur and professional biologists, attracted by the potential of molecular and synthetic biology. Anyone is welcome, so get involved! It's fascinating, the field and community is growing all the time, together with the ability of amateurs to do cool stuff. Over the past couple of years we've been developing our equipment, optimising techniques and running some research projects. Here's quite a good short local news video showing our lab and some of what we do in it. (we have since moved to larger premises and upgraded our equipment significantly)
We meet Wednesdays from 7:30pm.

We also maintain an outward facing website at BioHackspace.org

How to find us
Come to the Hackspace Open Evening - every tuesday from 7:30pm. There should be a few of us around to show you the lab and give you an idea of what we do. If you want to make sure we find each other you can email us to let us know you're coming.
Email us here . You can also sign up to our mailing list where we do most of our communication here (if you see a warning ignore it) (Your posts will be moderated unless you're signed up to the list. If you want to be signed up to the list but not receive messages you can change this in the options). You can view the mailing list archives through the previous link or through the google groups interface. To chat in more detail request a signup to our slack channel using the email address above, or join our irc channel at #london-biohackers on freenode
Biohackspace Membership
We're a subgroup of the London Hackspace, and our rent and utility bills are paid as part of the larger space. Therefore it's usually the case that London Biohackers are also members of the hackspace. You can find out how to become a hackspace member here .
There is a separate subscription for the biohacking group. Biohacking is more expensive than the typical hackspace activity, and with your membership we can pay for reagents, lab consumables and any equipment we may need for our experiments. The suggested minimum donation is £2 a week, but again, you can come along without joining. If you start to come regularly and use consumables then we'd like you to pay.  Details on how to setup payment to become a biohackspace member are here: Details of Membership .
We also have an arrangement for people who just want to support the biohackspace work and lab costs, and do not intend to regularly attend the biolab to do science. If you want to become a remote member, or to donate equipment and make a regular contribution, and you can make contact here by email , or see the Donations/Remote members page for more details.
However it's not essential to become a member just to come along initially and find out what we do.
Organization
The biohackspace operates as a Company Limited by guarantee. The legal details of this are here

Our lab
Our lab is small in size but we have tried to make good use of the tight space to incorporate all the equipment we need to carry out interesting projects. You can see a floor plan of the lab here .
We are currently working towards being are a certified Containment Level 1 Lab ( more details on biosafety classifications ).
The Lab is the registered office of our limited company, London Biological Laboratories , used to deal with suppliers.
How to use the Lab
Please do not touch things in the lab if you do not know what they are or how to use them. Many items may be hazards to your health if used incorrectly.
Our lab manual details our equipment, reagents, strains and our established protocols.
Equipment we made
Our hope is to be able to use self-developed or open source hardware equipment where possible in order to carry out our projects. Here is what we have done so far:
Project:Gel electrophoresis box
Biobot
Project:Shaker platform
A list of biohacking hardware projects is here Project:Biohardware
