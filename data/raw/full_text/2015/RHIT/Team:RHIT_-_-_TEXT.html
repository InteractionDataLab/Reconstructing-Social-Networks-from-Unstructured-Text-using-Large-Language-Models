Welcome to the RHIT Team's MitochONdriOFF project!
Our project focuses on controlling aerobic respiration in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will address this objective by regulating the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPS12. This protein is essential to the function of mitochondrial ribosomes, which produce key components of the electron transport chain. Without these components, the electron transport chain is disabled and aerobic respiration is not possible.
