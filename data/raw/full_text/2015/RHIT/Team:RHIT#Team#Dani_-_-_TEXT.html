Dani is a member of the graduating Class of 2016, is an active member of Chi Omega, and is involved in Tri Beta. She is a Biology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology double major from Indiana, and is excited for Graduate School to focus on Molecular Biology. She enjoys long nights in the lab, a good micro-pipette, and when digests work out the first time.
