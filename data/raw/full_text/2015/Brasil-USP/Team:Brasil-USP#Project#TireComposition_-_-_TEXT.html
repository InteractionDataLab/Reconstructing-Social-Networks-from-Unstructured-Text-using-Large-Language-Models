Tire's Composition
    Tire is one of the most important components of any motor vehicle, supporting its weight, its cargo and making direct contact with the ground. It is responsible for turning the motor power into traction, as well as for the stability of the vehicle and its efficiency of braking.
    They are mainly composed of different types of rubber, fillers - such as clay and silica - carbon black and minerals and chemicals that speed up the vulcanization process, making these materials very difficult to recycle. Each of the different rubber types present very different properties which require great precision in manufacturing. Normally, mean quantities are showed in Figure 1.

Tire's Structure
Let´s take a look inside the tires:
Tire structure
Inner Liner
    The inner liner has the function of holding high-pressure air inside. It is composed of rubber layer with low air permeability, and generally consists of butyl, synthetic rubber, or polyisoprene type.
Crown Belt or breaker
    The breaker has the function of absorbing external shock and helps prevent any tread injury from coming into direct contact with the carcass. In order to do that, the breaker is placed in between the tread and carcass and it is made of chord. Also, the breaker prevents the separation from the rubber layer and the carcass.
    The belt is a strong reinforcement layer placed in between the tread and carcass in radial tires. The belt’s functions are similar to the breaker’s but it also tightens the carcass reinforcing the strength of the tread.
Tread
    The tread is highly resistant to protect the carcass and belt. It consists of a thick layer of rubber which comes into direct contact with the road surface. Besides, rubber with strong anti-inner abrasion features is used to increase tire’s driving lifespan.
Casing Ply and Crown Plies
    This provides more strength to the tire and are alternate layer of rubber-coated fabric.
Sidewall
    The sidewall has the function of protecting the carcass on the inside and  providing a comfortable riding experience due to its flexibility during driving.
Shoulder
    The shoulder dissipates heat that is accumulated inside tires while driving.
Bead
    The bead is in contact with the rim, then, in the case of sudden reduction of air pressure while driving, the tire will not become loose from the rim. The bead is made up of various parts including the bead wire, core, rubber and flipper.
