In 1943, the engineer Bertold Suhner founded Metrohm - a swiss company that first entered the market by building technical instrumentation such as radios, oscilloscopes and phameters. During its history, Metrohm was always a pioneer in developing important laboratory tools, such as the first piston burettes, in 1956; and the first automatic polarographic device in 1954; among others products. In 1987, Metrohm entered the ion analysis area and, nowadays, it is the only company in the world that develops all the main technologies in this field, becoming a worldwide reference. In early 2000s, Metrohm developed a partnership with Pensalab, a Brazilian company founded in 1996. After 5 years, a joint-venture created Metrohm Pensalab, a company that provides services and solutions in laboratory and processes. Since 2010, Metrohm Pensalab is a reference for all Latin America for Metrohm products and solutions.
Metrohm has supported our team financially.

Research Groups
The spectroscopic techniques are some of the various physics tools that enable the knowledge of the biomolecules structures at the atomic level. Studies on development in the Molecular Biophysics research Group are trying to interpret molecular structures due to interactions in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence, FT-IR, EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) allow monitoring conformational changes of biomolecules in the presence of ligands, chemical or physical agents, action of different organic solvents, and molecular mechanisms involved in functional processes and denaturation and refolding of proteins. Our team used its infrastructure to perform Molecular Biology experiments.
Created in 2013, the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology Group (GNano) is part of Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, University of Sao Paulo. Under the supervision of Professor Valtencir Zucolotto, GNano has as its main focus the application of nanotechnology in medical and biomedical areas. Synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, nanotoxicology studies in vivo and in vitro and development of devices such as biosensors are commonly performed. Experiments of flow cytometry and fluorometry related to our iGEM project were performed at this laboratory.
The Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Crystallography Group in the Physics Institute of São Carlos - University of São Paulo pioneered protein crystallography in Brazil in the beginning of the 1990s. Since then structure determination of parasite specific proteins have been its main research focus. Our team used its infrastructure to perform Molecular Biology experiments.
The Laboratory of Medicinal and Computational Chemistry has a solid infrastructure and multidisciplinary expertise aimed at the identification and development of new bioactive molecules that can be used to treat infectious parasitic diseases - such as Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis and malaria -, pathologic diseases as cancer and also agrochemical design.
