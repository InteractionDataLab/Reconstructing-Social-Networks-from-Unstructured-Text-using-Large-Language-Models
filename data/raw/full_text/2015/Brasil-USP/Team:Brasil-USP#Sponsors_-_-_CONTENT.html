        The spectroscopic techniques are some of the various physics tools that enable the knowledge of the biomolecules structures at the atomic level. Studies on development in the <SPAN class="TextoVerde">Molecular Biophysics research Group</SPAN> are trying to interpret molecular structures due to interactions in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence, FT-IR, EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) allow monitoring conformational changes of biomolecules in the presence of ligands, chemical or physical agents, action of different organic solvents, and molecular mechanisms involved in functional processes and denaturation and refolding of proteins. Our team used its infrastructure to perform Molecular Biology experiments.
