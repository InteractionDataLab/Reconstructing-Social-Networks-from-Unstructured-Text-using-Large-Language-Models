Modeling Results
    To have a quantitative understanding of our circuit and test other possibilities, we have developed models to predict gene expression and chemical interactions based on stochastic processes and differential equations. We were able to test our kill switch mechanism, predicting the timing balance in terms of the expression rate of tetR.
While developing our models, we kept the following objectives in mind:
To analyze our system quantitatively.
To gain predictive power.
To create framework to scale our system to industrial levels.
    To make it easier for the reader, we have divided below the main processes.
