Silver badge
We experimentally validated four new BioBrick Parts of our own design and construction worked as expected.
We documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for the Parts:
BBa_K1819006
BBa_K1819007
BBa_K1819008
BBa_K1819009
These parts are different from those documented in Bronze medal criterion #6
Submissions adhered to the iGEM Registry guidelines
As Human Practices activities we organized a Latin America teams meeting , presented our project in academic events , visited tire pyrolysis and tire recycling companies, performed a research of Women in Science, projected our patent and talked to innovation specialists , and made an educational activity with children.
Gold badge
In our collaborations we describe our collaborations. In particular, helped a few registered iGEM teams participating in surveys and surveys and discussing technical project details, and prepared a Hands-On lecture on modeling/simulating.
We improved the function and characterization of previously existing BioBrick Parts and entered this information in the part's page on the Registry: BBa_E0040 and BBa_K823003
We expanded on our silver medal Human Practices activities investigating issues when visiting ANIP and explored all the possibilities to develop our technology in order to impact the society directly.
