Hilde Harb Buzzá
    Age: 27 years old
    Current course: Doctorate at Biomolecular Physics (IFSC/USP)
    Hilde, tell us about your academic experience.
    I graduated in the first class of the Physical and Biomolecular Sciences course at São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC/USP). During my Scientific Initiation I worked with proteins crystallography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the study of epilepsy. Since my Master's in Biomolecular Physics, I have been studying the vascular effect in photodynamic therapy and, during my PhD, I have been analyzing a tumoral model in corialantoic membrane.
    Why did you choose a scientific career?
    I have always liked mathematics, biology, physics and similar areas a lot. Therefore, I wanted a course that united natural and biological sciences and, at the same time, allowed me to perform a research with applications in the healthcare area. So, at the same year I did the exam to enter university, the Physical and Biological Sciences course at IFSC/USP opened.
    Currently, has the presence of women in exact sciences been increasing? How do you see it in your own course?
    This number has increased a lot. It is obvious that at IFSC there are still more men than women, but when I remember about the time I entered the institute, I realize that the difference is not so big today. In my course, for example, the number of women and men is more equal.
    Would you say there is any kind of gender segregation or discrimination, even if it is subtle? If yes, would you say happens unconsciously?
    I believe so. I have never suffered it, I have never been told: “Oh, you’re a woman, you can’t do science…”. But I know about older people that have suffered a lot because they were women. There is a kind of harassment when people say a woman only succeeds because she is pretty. I think that in most cases this happens unconsciously. This is rooted in our society.
    An academic career, with graduation, master and doctorate, most of the time stabilizes at 30 years old. How does it impact you? Does it depend on the gender?
    This varies from people and their dreams. I think a 30 year old person is still young. Today, with this age, a lot still have many objectives. When you are 30 years old there is still a lot to do. For example, I intend to do post-doctorate abroad and come back to Brazil later and work here.
