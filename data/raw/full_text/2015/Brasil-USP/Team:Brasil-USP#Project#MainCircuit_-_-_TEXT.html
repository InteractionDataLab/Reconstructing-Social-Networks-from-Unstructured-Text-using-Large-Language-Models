    Natural and synthetic rubber degradation has been reported for some microorganisms such as Streptomyces sp. strain K30, Gordonia polyisoprenivorans, Nocardia sp. strain 835A and Xanthomonas sp. strain 35Y.1 However, most of these organisms show a slow growth when using rubber as a sole carbon source.2-4
   To improve microbial rubber degradation efficiency, our project aims to create a gene circuit which will, among other things, be responsible for coding and expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase A) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein). These enzymes are fundamental for rubber degradation and have to be secreted or exposed in the exterior of the cell to be in direct contact with their substrate, the poly(cis-1,4 isoprene) - the main component of rubber. The proposed circuit provides the secretion of the proteins by the fusion with a specific signal sequence, the Twin-arginine translocation (TAT) sequence, or its binding to the bacterial outer membrane by the fusion with a specific protein, OmpA fused with a linker ( BBa_K1489002 ).
