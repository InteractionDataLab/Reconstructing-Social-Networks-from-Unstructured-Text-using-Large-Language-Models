Promoter Test 1
Assembly Map
     This assembly map describes a promoter test performed in our project. This test follows the expression of TetR using a reporter at the same time as its activity inhibiting the promoter using a second reporter. The succesfully constructed assemblies are indicated by a green check point. Click on these assemblies to access the lab form.
