Project's Name
    As our team presented the project to possible sponsors and partners, some concern about the name of the project, RubberBye, has arised. We were warned that RubberBye could give a negative connotation to rubber use, and, because of that, we could lose some potential partners in rubber industry. That being said, our team has discussed the subject and decided to launch a survey to find out the public opinion about our project’s name. The questionnaire was simple and rapid, being answered in 2-3 minutes, and can be found in this link .
    Here is the return we have got from the public:
-What do you think about the name RubberBye? (Answer analysing the general aspect. Ex. Sonority, idea associated to the name, identity, etc.) - Being 1 “Very bad” and  5 “Very good”.
The majority of the public has enjoyed the name RubberBye, considering its general aspects. More than 70% of the interviewed people agrees that the name is “Good” or “Very good”, showing a great public acceptance.
-Brasil-USP team is developing a bacterium capable of accelerating degradation of waste rubber, such as tires, and plans to obtain as the final product of this process a fuel. Do you think the name  RubberBye translates the concept of the project? - Being 1 “Translates very badly” and 5 “Translates very well”.
About 60% of the public believes that the name RubberBye “Translates well” or “Translates very well” the idea of the project. Other 30% of the interviewed have voted in option “3” and only 10% of the voters believe that the name “Translates badly” the project’s intention. Therefore, we believe that our name is mostly transmitting the main idea of our work in a simple manner.
-Do you believe that the name RubberBye brings any bad connotation to rubber use? - Being 1 “No” and 5 “Yes”.
The majority of voters (about 60%) agree that the name RubberBye doesn’t present any bad connotations to rubber usage. Approximately 20% have a neutral opinion and 20% believe that there is a bad connotation.
Analyzing the survey results, our team decided to stick to the name RubberBye, which showed great public acceptance, translates the project’s idea in a simple manner and, for the majority of voters, doesn’t present a bad connotation to rubber use.
