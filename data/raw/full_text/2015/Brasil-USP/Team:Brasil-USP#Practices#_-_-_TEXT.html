Policy & Practices
    In order to better understand the real impact our project could cause in Brazil and worldwide, we visited several companies, agencies and organizations - mainly that work with residual rubber recycling and tires - making us get deeply in touch with our chosen theme and the viability of developing it. Also, we have visited a communitarian center and interacted with amazing children, explaining them, with a simple play, about how synthetic biology works and how it can improve ther lifes about dengue disesase. We also organized a Brazilian version of Jamboree (our “Jamboré”), where Brazilian teams could meet and discuss about their projects and the general scenarium of synthetic biology. At this opportunity, we even had the amazing presence of Anita Sifuentes, from iGEM headquarters! At last, but not least, we realized that our team is composed, basically, by women and, in this issue, we decided to investigate more about the topic “women in science”.
