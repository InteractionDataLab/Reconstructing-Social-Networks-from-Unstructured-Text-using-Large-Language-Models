Jamboré Meeting
     On July 18th, we've hosted Jamboré, a brazilian meeting especially organized for Latin American teams to discuss Synthetic Biology and topics relevant to their projects. We could hear directly from iGEM UFSCar and Equipe iGEM-UFMG about their latest progress and discuss with them issues we've had in common. We also had an extra-special keynote talk  by Anita Sifuentes, from iGEM headquarters! We were very happy that we could create a welcoming environment to share ideas, issues and our experiences so far in this year's competition.
Meeting program
RubberBye - Brasil-USP Project Presentation
In this talk, we presented our ideas on how to use a synthetic system to degrade natural rubber, while still ending up with product of high commercial value: fuel. We also shared some of our plans to turn it into a startup soon enough!
iGEM UFSCar - UFSCar Team Project Presentation
UFSCar Team then shared us their solution to help avoiding diseases transmitted by insect vectors, such as malaria and dengue: engineering bacteria carrying out the production of D-limonene to serve as a repellent with low-toxicity.

LeishMANIA - UFMG_Brazil Project Presentation
UFMG_Brazil team proposed in their talk the use of an optimized visceral Leishmania strain to direct drugs to specific macrophages associated to Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that culminates in a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the joint lining.

iGEM - Ana Sifuentes' talk
Directly from iGEM headquarters, our keynote speaker, Ana Sifuentes, presented a few facts about the competition and shared a few interesting historical facts. Afterwards, there was a follow up section of questions focused on how to improve our participation in iGEM.
ModeliGEM - Modeling of Biological Systems
During this talk, our team presented an introduction to modeling, starting from a general problem, and bringing into discussion the scientific method and the role of quantitative measurements in general science.

I am participating of Jamboré because my “future team” and I are planning to join iGEM competition in 2016. We came to know more about how to be an iGEM team. I think this event is extremely important to motivate us and meet people that can help us. Congratulations, the event was really enlightening.

Jamboré represents a landmark for Synthetic Biology in Brazil. As a member of an iGEM team, I see the lack of knowledge and ignorance in our population of this new science area. These discussions meetings are important to disclosure and exchange of knowledge.

The event was an opportunity to be closer to other teams allowing us to understand, innovate and help other projects. Also it is a way to promote debates and learn more about iGEM competition, because it always has something new.
