           </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette sponsor"><DIV class="container"><H2>Camila Barbosa Bramorski</H2><P style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><B>Undergraduate in Physical and Biomolecular Sciences</B></P><P>     Camila currently works in the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology group developing biosensors for biomedical applications that promise to diagnose and run tests in a cheaper, simpler and faster way than nowadays technologies. It is her second year on iGEM and she is very dedicated on finding a moment during the team meetings to make a (not always that funny) joke and she doesn't care if it costs her integrity. Besides that, she contributed with: starting the team, sponsorship tasks and meetings, human practices, Jamboré presentation, entrepreneurship, product transformation, circuit's study and scientific research.<SPAN class="TextoVerde">Why iGEM:</SPAN> If I had to summarize iGEM in one word I would say &quot;complete&quot;. Not the most impactful word but it fits perfectly. I will tell a short story of what is iGEM from my point of view and then it will be very clear “why iGEM”: iGEM starts with reading and learning about things you have never heard before. Synthetic biology lies on the border of knowledge, putting together different areas and it makes you think &quot;This is magical. I am so doing this&quot;. There are so many creative projects that there seems to be no limits to creativity, and this is where the fun begins. The next step is to talk to your colleagues and start a team and, sooner than you expect: goodbye comfort zone. You have to present your ideas, to spread what is iGEM, what is synthetic biology and of course, what is your project to the public, to the university, to companies - and the list never ends. You start to improve your public communication skills. Then you need to help with the project development, read many scientific papers, and learn how to search and read them in a optimized way. The more you read, the more you realise you know nothing. Breathe, you are not alone. You share all the moments with your team and day by day you feel a friendship getting stronger. During the development of the project, you will need help and it will make you get in touch with awesome people. Probably for the first time in your academic life, you will talk to the community about your project and see, by your eyes, how it impacts the society and the planet. You will come back to the lab feeling even more motivated, as now you are sure that you are changing the world. You want the project to become real, so you take the next step and think about how to apply it, and it might bring you the first shot of real life and business. In the end of it, you will travel to the Giant Jamboree and live one of the most challenging and enriching experiences ever. You have learned (at least a little bit) of everything. Finances, design, documents, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, communication, HTML, languages, entrepreneurship, poster, presentation, events, modeling, laboratory experiments and more. There is no way to tell in a few words how much you will learn and experience with iGEM. As I said, it is complete. That is my &quot;why iGEM&quot; and I am very glad of being part of it.
