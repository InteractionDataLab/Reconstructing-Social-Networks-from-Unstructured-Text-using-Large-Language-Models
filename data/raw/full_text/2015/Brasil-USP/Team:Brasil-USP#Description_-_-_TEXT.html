Project Description
Brasil-USP team`s 2015 project is to develop an innovative and sustainable solution for a significant environmental problem: accumulation of waste tires. Current recycling techniques demand high energy consumption, and are completely overwhelmed by the annual amount of rubber waste. In addition, natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years. We aim to accelerate this process by genetically engineering microorganisms to express and secrete two crucial enzymes for the degradation of natural rubber: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein). Tires and several other products, however, are composed by vulcanized rubber, which ensures its durability and increase its elasticity and strength. In this regard, for vulcanized rubber degradation, the project may include a pre-treatment, which uses Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, bacteria that naturally devulcanizes rubber. Both of these processes will be scaled up in bioreactors.  The major resulting compound of the designed process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyl-trideca-4,8-diene-1-al), a triisoprene unit that can be turned into products with high commercial interest. Theoretical studies performed by our team indicate that it is possible to chemically or enzymatically transform this molecule into a fuel or a new polymer. In this yearâ€™s project, we propose a mechanism to alter this molecule into a highly functional compound. Consequently, besides enabling faster rubber degradation and decreasing final pollutant emission, our project also grants the final product a considerable economic interest.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
