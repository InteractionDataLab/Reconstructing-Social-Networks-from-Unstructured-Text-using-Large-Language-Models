Cornell iGEM’s fishPHARM would not have been possible without the advice and guidance of many of our advisors.
The wet lab portion of our research was conducted in Cornell’s Biomedical Engineering instructional lab run by Dr. Shivaun Archer. Dr. Archer provided our team with the necessary lab facilities including a gel imaging station, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. She also advised us on lab safety techniques and assisted with training of new members on safe laboratory equipment usage.
Dr. Rod Getchell of Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine aided our team in project planning, as well as provided several strains of Flavobacterium psychrophilum to test the toxicity of our various EcnB isoforms. Dr. Getchell also provided us with their lab space including their incubator, sterile hood, and autoclave, along with a advice on how to grow and work with Flavobacterium psychrophilum.
The Fish Disease Control Unit of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Rome, N.Y, and the Cornell University Biological Field Station, Oneida Lake, N.Y provided feedback on the dry lab fish tag prototype.
The DeLisa Lab and Aravind Natarajan, graduate research associate of the DeLisa Lab, kindly provided the team with wet lab troubleshooting procedures.
The Zipfel lab provided us with a strain of Escherichia Coli as chassis for our genetic constructs.
Dr. Xiling Shen provided the team with advice throughout project planning and technical expertise on synthetic biology. Additionally, Dr. Shen provided feedback on our presentation and wiki materials.
Sequencing was performed by staff at Cornell's Biotechnology Resource Center.
We'd also like to extend thanks to the many faculty and staff at Cornell including Rebecca Macdonald, Sue Bulkley, and Emily Tompkins who help us tremendously with team organization and business relations.
Thank You!
