We are comprised of students from different majors: biotechnology engineering, design, and computer technology. We also are from across the country, reunited in the same school. We interact
        and enrich each other’s ideas as we contrast our points of views.</P><P>We all started as a group of strangers that during the course of the project ended up as best friends, trusting and knowing each other. We first discovered in each other the interest in synthetic biology, and ended up as more than colleagues. The
        team was what it was thanks to our various abilities and different personalities. And that is what created this year’s project, the introduction of an insect cell platform to the competition.</P><H1>Members</H1></ARTICLE><DIV class="row team-photos"><DIV class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3 member-photo"><DIV><H3><SPAN>Ana Karen T</SPAN></H3></DIV><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" title="Biobrick assembly/General Lab Work/ Low budget Colombia" data-content="Uptown girl.

The students’ chair (i4) is an opportunity offered by the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, through its School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, so students interested in biotechnology and food industries can develop projects in the area. The concept is based on four core values:</P><OL><LI>Imagine.</LI><LI>Investigate.</LI><LI>Innovate.</LI><LI>Incubate.</LI></OL><P>Student teams, like ours, that want to apply your project may reach hatching their own business, running an article in scientific research, process your patent application and compete internationally.

Three times iGEMer, Camilo’s experience was helpful to help us sort out problems in and out of the lab. He was always there willing to give us some advice about any kind of issues. Also, he helped us contact some of the other Mexican iGEM teams to generate a better human practice.
César Ortiz: César is MSc specialized in Biotechnology currently working at the Biotechnology Center at the Molecular Biology Division. He is a relaxed person who enjoys helping every possible time and way. He has a very critical and empathetic opinion to improve the work of the others while maintaining harmony. He kindly provided us with lots of helpful advice (and material).
Jesús Hernández (Chucho): Ex-iGEMer, and graduate from B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering. He is part of the Molecular Biology Laboratory in the FEMSA Biotechnology Center. From the very beginning, he was always there to help and give us some great advice. </P><H3>Instructors</H3><P>Guy Cardineau: Dr. Cardineau began his career in the field of Agricultural Biotechnology in 1983 as a scientist at a small start-up company, Sungene Technologies, where he also served a short time as Manager of Market Development. He has 28 issued US patents and 19 published applications and over 140 patent applications worldwide. These works include: broad enabling patents describing the earliest production of vaccines in transgenic plants, the synthesis of genes to improve their expression in a foreign host and the only plant that makes vaccines approved by a regulatory authority for commercial release. We thank him for his kind support to get the project going, as well as all his advice, and all the material that he kindly gave us.
José Manuel Aguilar: José Manuel Aguilar majored in Biology with a specialty in Molecular Biology and holds a PhD in Biotechnology. He was responsible for the production of a more efficient procedure for the detection of influenza H1N1 during its pandemia, and the development of a vaccine using bacteria instead of chicken eggs. We thank him for his guidance and support during the project development. </P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE id="sponsors" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><H1>Sponsors</H1><DIV><DIV><DIV class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><H4 class="text-center">• Cátedra i4 &amp; Tecnológico de Monterrey - School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences</H4><P>o We are especially grateful with them for their genesdrous sponsorship and the trust they had in us.
