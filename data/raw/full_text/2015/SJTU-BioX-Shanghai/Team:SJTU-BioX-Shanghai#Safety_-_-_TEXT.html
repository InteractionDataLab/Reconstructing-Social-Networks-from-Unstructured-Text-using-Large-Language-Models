In the Lab
All of our team members received safety training and lab procedure education before starting any work in the lab. We also had a middle-term safety meeting to ensure our safety protocols were observed. We specifically focused on emergency rules, waste disposal, cleanliness, and the use of any laboratory apparatuses. This was all done in accordance with the instruction of Shanghai Jiaotong University Assets Management Bureau, which is responsible for biological safety matter.
All work carried out followed the biosafety guidelines WS233-2002 , which is established by Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, and other related guidelines.
Project safety
The Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and E. coli strains used are not thought to pose any risk to the safety and health of the general public as they would not be able to compete outside the lab during the experiments.
However,some of the cyanobacteria does contain toxin molecule that is harmful to human being. For this question, we especially consult Prof. Peiming He, who is an experts working on cyanobacteria application from Shanghai Ocean University. He told us that there's no toxin produced by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as far as he know.
When we consider this in the aspect of evolution, we cannot predict the possibility that there's an unknown toxin can be produced by PCC6803. Fortunately, seawater desalination is a complicated process. The final process is RO membrane that even can keep small molecule like ions out. Thus, we are confident that the end product will be safe.
Furthermore, the potential of components misusing of our project is limited. It may make it more accessible for the general public or 'DIY Bio' labs to desalinate. But people with malicious intentions might also use our Biobricks to produce toxic proteins or other harmful substances. This, however, is a problem shared by all iGEM and synthetic biology projects and not unique to our work.
Industry safety procedure
As an iGEM project, we shall take responsibility for our safety problem in many ways. In this section, we have to describe our idea about how to produce a safety product water and how to treat other sub product properly after all.
Since this is related to process flow, this part is mainly discussed in Human Practice with the combination of lab work. We will briefly introduce the elements which ensures the safety.
Safety product water
The safety is ensured with the following three steps of the process flow. These steps have its own main function as well as safety function to make sure the last product is eligible.
The step
The sub product it is removing
Cell-water separation
Most of the cyanobacteria, part of bio molecules
Pretreatment
The remaining cyanobacteria ,bio molecules and most of the ions
RO membrane process:
Anything left behind besides water molecule
Sub product
Utilization of biomass has been discussed in our cell-water separation section .
The other sub products are shared in all the desalination industry, brine. The utilization of brine is a part of the main focus of the national strategy in China. However, there’s not a very effective way to achieve this utilizing procedure, so most of the plants are discharge it. This is a general problem shared by all desalination methods and is not unique to our work. Therefore, we are not going to discuss this problem further.
Protocol and index
Supervising is very important during industry process. Testing at every gate will provide a more detailed data about how the flow runs and what might go wrong. Especially, improper supervising in water industry can cause massive accidents. Therefore, we also considered some important points and indexes to detect frequently.
Test point
Test Item
Reasons and further use of the data
Intake
GB3097-1997
The seawater properties changes during different seasons and months. We cannot change the intake spot to adjust, yet, we certainly can adjust the pretreatment to make sure this doesn’t influence the outcome.
Before bio-desalination
Main: CFU
Inorganic nitrogen
Reactive phosphate
Bio-process appreciated a rich nutrition environment without any competitive organism. To test how rich the water is will help to adjust the growing stage of cyanobacteria.
After cell-water separation
Main: CFU
Inorganic nitrogen
Reactive phosphate
This test is to ensure most of the cyanobacteria and biomolecule is removed.
Before RO membrane method
GB5749-2006
Especially the elements which will damage the RO membrane
Outcome
Boron
GB5749-2006
Product check!
Above, we discussed the safety in four aspects: lab, project, industry, supervising protocols. Some parts of our discussion need to be further established when the project applies to real circumstances.
