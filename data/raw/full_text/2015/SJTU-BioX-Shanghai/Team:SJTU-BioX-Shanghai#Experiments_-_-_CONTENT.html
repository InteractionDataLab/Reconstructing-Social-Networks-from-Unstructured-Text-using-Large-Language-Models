Loaded equal amounts of protein into the wells of the SDS-PAGE gel, along with molecular weight markers. 
Ran the gel for first 50 minutes at 80V and then 1 hour at 100V (until marker is at the bottom of the gel). </P><P><B>2.4 Transferring the protein from the gel to the membrane</B>
Transfer: Blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Pre-wet required materials in transfer buffer. 
Stacked in the following order: 
*Case (white side) 
*Sponge
*Whatman filter paper
*Membrane
*Gel
*Whatman filter paper
*Sponge
*Case (black side) 
Took two separate clean plates which should free from any protein contamination. Put transfer buffer on these two plates.

Soaked all the materials mentioned above at least 30 min before running for transfer the protein from gel onto PVDF membrane. 

“Activate” PVDF with methanol for one minute and rinsed with transfer buffer before preparing the stack. Stacking is done very carefully ensuring that there is not a single bubble present.

Placed the transfer apparatus with black side facing black into the tank filled with transfer buffer.

Set the machine at 0.35A for 1 hr. (The voltage noticed very carefully as it should not be lower than 80A or upper than 200A). 

Put the tank into ice box and check frequently short interval.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="3._Antibody_staining">3. Antibody staining</SPAN></H3><P><B>3.1 Blocking </B>

1. The length of primers should be limited between 20~60bp. For overlapping PCR, the overlapping domain should contains at least 15bp. 
2. GC% should be at around 40%~60%. 
3. Before synthesis, blast the primer using software like Vector NTI or other methods to check the specificity. 
The primers are synthesized by GeneWise. After the arriving of the primers, perform a quick spin and then dissolve the DNA powder using ddwater in the given volume.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="PCR_Volume:">PCR Volume:</SPAN></H3><P>If the PCR product will be used for testing, we suggest that the volume should be under 20 μl. If the PCR product will be used for any downstream operation (eg. Purification, gel extraction, restriction enzyme digestion), higher volume such as 50μl should be used. And for every sample, there should be at least two parallels. So, mix the total mixture in a 1.5ml centrifuge tube beforehand and then separate the desired volume mixture into each PCR tube is recommended.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="PCR_Reaction_Mixture:">PCR Reaction Mixture:</SPAN></H3><P>We used 2×PrimeSTAR Mix from TAKARA and 2×Taq Master Mix from LifeFeng for PCR reaction, which have already contained buffer, magnesium, dNTP and polymerase. The amount of primer should be at around 10μM and the total amount of template should be under 200ng as the protocols require (less template is needed if use genomic DNA or plasmid DNA as template, see specifically in the protocols of the products). Additionally, the bacteria liquid template must not be too much or else small fragments of bacteria may cause a jam while performing gel analysis. And pay attention to the overlapping PCR: the amount of the two templates should be equal and the primer is added later (see specifically at the example “Overlapping PCR”).</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="PCR_Conditions:">PCR Conditions:</SPAN></H3><P>Denaturing conditions-94℃～98℃ for 5~15 seconds. For bacteria liquid PCR, longer denaturing time (10~15minutes) is required for completely cell splitting. 
Annealing temperature-the annealing temperature is usually 3~5℃ lower than the melting temperatures of primers. If the melting temperatures of two primers differ greatly (for example, &gt;5℃), try gradient PCR to find out the appropriate annealing temperature. 
Here are examples of the three kinds of PCR that we used in the experiments:</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="General_PCR_.2850.CE.BCl_volume.29:">General PCR (50μl volume):</SPAN></H4><P><TABLE frame="box" rules="all"><TBODY><TR><TH colspan="3">PCR reaction mixture</TH></TR><TR><TD>Forward primer</TD><TD>1μl (10μM)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Reverse primer</TD><TD>1μl (10μM)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Template</TD><TD>&lt;200ng</TD></TR><TR><TD>2×PrimeSTAR Mix</TD><TD>25μl</TD></TR><TR><TD>ddwater</TD><TD>Fill up to 50μl</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Amplification_procedure:">Amplification procedure:</SPAN></H5><P><TABLE frame="box" rules="all"><TBODY><TR><TD>98℃ (pre-denaturation) </TD><TD>3min</TD></TR><TR><TD>98℃(denaturation) </TD><TD>10s</TD><TD rowspan="3">×30~35 cycle</TD></TR><TR><TD>Annealing temperature </TD><TD> 5s </TD></TR><TR><TD>72℃(extension)  </TD><TD> 5s/kb</TD></TR><TR><TD>72℃</TD><TD>3min</TD></TR><TR><TD>12℃</TD><TD>∞</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Overlapping_PCR.2850.CE.BCl_volume.29:">Overlapping PCR(50μl volume):</SPAN></H4><P>Overlapping PCR is a commonly used method to link two fragments together.

Bacteria liquid PCR or colony PCR is used for detecting whether the colony contains the desired plasmid or not. It can lessen the workload when extracting the plasmid, however, the case of false positives is unavoidable (decreasing cycle number may help to reduce the false positive, but we didn’t do any test to prove it). Variety kinds of examinations should be performed before sequencing. You can see that specifically in “Restriction Enzyme Reaction” and “Blue-white Screen”.</P><TABLE frame="box" rules="all"><TBODY><TR><TH colspan="3">PCR reaction mixture</TH></TR><TR><TD>Forward primer</TD><TD>1μl (10μM)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Reverse primer</TD><TD>1μl (10μM)</TD></TR><TR><TD>Template(bacteria liquid)</TD><TD>1μl</TD></TR><TR><TD>2×Taq Mix</TD><TD>10μl</TD></TR><TR><TD>ddwater</TD><TD>Fill up to 20 μl</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Amplification_procedure:_3">Amplification procedure:</SPAN></H5><P><TABLE frame="box" rules="all"><TBODY><TR><TD>95℃ (pre-denaturation)  </TD><TD>10~15min</TD></TR><TR><TD>94℃(denaturation)</TD><TD>10~30s</TD><TD rowspan="3">×20~25 cycle</TD></TR><TR><TD>Annealing temperature </TD><TD> 10~30s  </TD></TR><TR><TD>72℃(extension)  </TD><TD> 1min/kb</TD></TR><TR><TD>72℃</TD><TD>3min</TD></TR><TR><TD>12℃</TD><TD>∞</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Trouble_shooting_:">Trouble shooting :</SPAN></H3><P>1.

Furthermore, if the gel is used for gel extraction or other operation requiring completely separation of different fragments, higher concentration should be used.
2. Dissolve the agarose powder in TBE solution buffer by heating it in microwave for about 5 minutes until no solid material can be seen.
3. Add EB solution (5μl/100ml) after the agarose solution cooling down.
4. Place the comb into the gel mold. Apply the agarose solution to the mold and wait for 30mins~1h to get the solid agarose gel. Attention: being exposed under light for too long can cause the degradation of EB. So put the ready-made gels into a box with TBE solution buffer as storage.
5. Mix the DNA sample with 6× loading buffer or 10× loading buffer (to denature the enzymes) or use reaction buffer that already contained loading buffer.  
6. Load the DNA sample to the gel. Set voltage and time to 130~160V and 30~15mins.

Here are a few additional notes:
1. After applying the solution that contains DNA sample to the column and centrifuging, reload the sample to the column and centrifuge for a second time in order to make sure that all the DNA samples are bound on the column.
2. Use water instead of elution buffer to elute, for that TE buffer may cause negative effect on enzyme reaction. Heat the ddwater to 50~60℃ in water bath to ensure that the pH of the ddwater is around 7.6. But if the DNA sample will be stored for a very long time, using elution buffer is better.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="LB_.28agar.29_medium_preparation">LB (agar) medium preparation</SPAN></H2><P>We used Sangon biotech LB broth medium(25.0g/L) or Sangon biotech LB broth agar(40.0g/L), which already contains yeast extraction, tryptone, sodium chloride (and agar) so that we only need to dissolve the powder in proportion to prepare LB (agar) medium.
For LB medium using for bacteria inoculation, split the medium into 5ml and transfer the 5ml medium respectively into 15ml tubes before autoclaving.
Autoclave under 121℃ for 30 minutes.
As for LB agar medium, after the temperature of the medium cooling down until it doesn’t hurt, add appropriate volume of antibiotic into the medium. Transfer the medium into 90mm plate afterwards. Approximately 15ml of LB agar medium is applied to each 90mm plate.

Use enzymes that produce sticky end instead of those produce blunt end.
2. Double digestion is better than single digestion because the latter can cause a self-ligation problem. The two cleavage sites should not be too close to each other for that it may be too crowded for two kinds of enzymes to bind onto the DNA together. We faced this problem in our experiments. The fact is, though the two cleavage sites are linked, double digestion is still the most efficient way. So use double digestion as possible.
3. If denaturation is needed, choose two kinds of enzyme that have the same denaturation protocol as possible.
4. Do not use isocaudarner to digest plasmid.

If the target sequence inserts successfully into the MCS, and is long enough to destroy the ORF of lacZ, the colonies will remain white. Therefore, we can easily distinguish the colonies which do not get the right plasmid transformed.
