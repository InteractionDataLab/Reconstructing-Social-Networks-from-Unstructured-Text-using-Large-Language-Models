In the growth stage and working stage, we provide white light, while in the induced expression stage the light source is removed. Darkness leads to starvation and the starvation can inhibit active export of sodium, which is essential for biodesalination in the working stage.(described in section transport module). The biodesalination process controlled by Pdark is shown in Figure 2.2.7.

Moreover, if the length of the induction stage and working stage are approximately 12h, after growth stage this improved biodesalination system can be controlled by the natural alternation between day and night without any human intervention.
