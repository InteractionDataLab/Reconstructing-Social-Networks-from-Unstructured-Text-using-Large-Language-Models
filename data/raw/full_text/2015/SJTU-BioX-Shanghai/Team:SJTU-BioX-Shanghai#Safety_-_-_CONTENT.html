We also had a middle-term safety meeting to ensure our safety protocols were observed. We specifically focused on emergency rules, waste disposal, cleanliness, and the use of any laboratory apparatuses. This was all done in accordance with the instruction of <B>Shanghai Jiaotong University Assets Management Bureau</B>, which is responsible for biological safety matter. 
</P><P>All work carried out followed the biosafety guidelines <A href="/wiki/images/6/64/WS_233-2002.pdf"> WS233-2002</A> , which is established by Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, and other related guidelines.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_safety">Project safety</SPAN></H2><P>The Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and E. coli strains used are not thought to pose any risk to the safety and health of the general public as they would not be able to compete outside the lab during the experiments.
</P><P>However,some of the cyanobacteria does contain toxin molecule that is harmful to human being. For this question, we especially consult <B>Prof. Peiming He</B>, who is an experts working on cyanobacteria application from Shanghai Ocean University. He told us that there's no toxin produced by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as far as he know.
</P><P>When we consider this in the aspect of evolution, we cannot predict the possibility that there's an unknown toxin can be produced by PCC6803. Fortunately, seawater desalination is a complicated process. The final process is RO membrane that even can keep small molecule like ions out. Thus, we are confident that the end product will be safe.
</P><P>Furthermore, the potential of components misusing of our project is limited. It may make it more accessible for the general public or 'DIY Bio' labs to desalinate. But people with malicious intentions might also use our Biobricks to produce toxic proteins or other harmful substances. This, however, is a problem shared by all iGEM and synthetic biology projects and not unique to our work.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Industry_safety_procedure">Industry safety procedure</SPAN></H2><P>As an iGEM project, we shall take responsibility for our safety problem in many ways. In this section, we have to describe our idea about how to produce a safety product water and how to treat other sub product properly after all. 
</P><P>Since this is related to process flow, this part is mainly discussed in <A href="/Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai/Practices"> Human Practice </A>  with the combination of lab work. We will briefly introduce the elements which ensures the safety.

</P><P>The other sub products are shared in all the desalination industry, <B>brine</B>. The utilization of brine is a part of the main focus of the national strategy in China. However, there’s not a very effective way to achieve this utilizing procedure, so most of the plants are discharge it. This is a general problem shared by all desalination methods and is not unique to our work. Therefore, we are not going to discuss this problem further.

Above, we discussed the safety in four aspects: lab, project, industry, supervising protocols. Some parts of our discussion need to be further established when the project applies to real circumstances.
