Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai/Collaboration
Collaboration
This year, we keep a close relationship with several iGEM team. Beside idea exchanging, we did some further collaboration little projects with some teams. In this page, you will see the sum of we did with other iGEMers involved.
Nanjing iGEM team
This year, we did two of our important HP work with Nanjing iGEM team.
The collaboration study about seawater environment restoration  merging with seawater desalination: Our work focuses on the significance of this mixed process than normal  plant restoration. Nanjing iGEMers focused on finding the best way possible to merge and further study guide.[ Practices |View more]
The sharing method of immobilization :Our team was working on immobilization of cyanobacteria in the hopes of long-term use. Nanjing iGEM team is working on a bio reactor device that contains immobilized materials. They shares some of their immobilized materials with us. Together, we are sharing data relating to the immobilization condition of our different hosts.
Meet-up
This year, we attend mostly small scale meet ups. In these activities, we had chances to exchange idea with the following teams : China_Tongji, NJAU_China, NYU_Shanghai, ITB_INDONESIA, SCUT-Champion-Park, SYSU_China, WHU-China, Tsinghua, ZJU-China, XJTLU-China and Fudan. Beside idea, team organizing and other topics were frequently being discussed as well.

Other Activities
Other than all this, we support the community by doing every small help we can give.That's why we submit two articles in XMU's newsletter and finished the following survey:
"Results and transparency in iGEM wikis"from iGEM Stockholm on 8.6.2015
"Questionnaire for previous iGEMer" from Tianjin-iGEM team on 8.8.2015
"iGEM Rhizi Tutorial" from Paris Bettencourt on 8.30.2015
"iShare: All-round Resource Sharing Proposition" from iGEM Nankai on 9.8.2015
