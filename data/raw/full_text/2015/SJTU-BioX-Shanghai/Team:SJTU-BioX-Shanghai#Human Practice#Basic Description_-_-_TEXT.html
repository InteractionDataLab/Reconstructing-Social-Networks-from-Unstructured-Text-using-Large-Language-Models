Basic Description
This year, HP takes the lab work one step further by establishing a simple expanded process flow. This flow includes the raw material (intake ) , bio-desalination, cell-water separation and Further processes(/application).  How does this established? Every step is not be considered through a single angle but a combination thought of several HP projects. We use keyword to introduce which steps each project tackle.

Sea vs Brackish water
Description: We explore the differences between seawater and brackish water in desalination process. From that, to explain why we think seawater has more potential in the future and how our project will help pushing this trend.
Keyword： The raw material (intake ) , Bio-desalination
Salt & Heavy metal
Description: Collaboration study of the combination of desalination process and seawater restoration (heavy- metal) . This study explain it’s theoretically advantage and matters needing attention when carrying out in the reality.
Keyword： The raw material (intake ) , Further processes(/application)
Bio- vs RO
Description:  A visit to an major company produce RO membrane, the main component of common desalination process. Depend on the visit and further study and communication, this part discusses the differences between our project and RO method, as well as, the cooperation possibility of two technology.

Cell-water separation
Description: This the most important process that related to safety. Our design is an single-use product, yet, in separation study, we design both single-use separation use as well as long-term use separation method. Furthermore, we also explained how single-use algae can be used further to produce valuable sub-product. The inspiration comes from algae cleanup process in the lake and river.
Keyword： Cell-water separation
Public and government
Description: Public and government acceptance , two different approach to gain social trust, are considered in our project. First, we did testing activities to see what they really interested  in or worry about. From this, we build two different strategy and relating materials.
Communication with other iGEM tea
Description:  This year we connected with other iGEM team through several small-scale visits and meet-ups. One of our major collaboration team is Nanjing iGEM team. We summarize our collaboration in this part as well as communication with other team.
