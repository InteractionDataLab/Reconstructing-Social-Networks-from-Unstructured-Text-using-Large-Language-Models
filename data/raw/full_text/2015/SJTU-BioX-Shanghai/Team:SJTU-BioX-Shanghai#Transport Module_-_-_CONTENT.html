They are membrane-integral proteins of the rhodopsin superfamily that form a covalent bond with the carotenoid-derived chromophore all-trans retinal. Absorption of a photon with a defined optimal wavelength induces trans-cis isomerization of retinal, which triggers a catalytic photocycle of conformational changes in the protein, resulting in the net import of one chloride per photon into the cytoplasm. (Amezaga, J. M. et al. 2014) We use it as our biodesalination driver which confers cyanobacteria the ability to absorb chloride to a significant degree.
</P><P>As for sodium, cyanobacteria can actively export sodium ion to maintain low internal sodium concentration under saline environment. And this is mainly performed by Na+/H+ antiporter and P-type Na+ ATPase; the former one requires H+ gradient as the energy source and the latter one consumes ATP directly. Since the ATP synthase is driven by H+ gradient, we can simply regard that ATP is required for the active Na+ export. To achieve efficient biodesalination, we have to inhibit this mechanism. In our design of transport module, we create starvation condition to suppress active sodium export. Moreover, the negative membrane potential generated by Cl- that is absorbed by halorhodopsin would drive the influx of cation through sodium ion channels. (Amezaga, J. M. et al. 2014)

(b) Under starvation, ATP reserve has been exhausted and Na+ flow through Na+ channels, which is driven by the negative membrane potential generated by Cl- that is absorbed by halorhodopsin (green oval).
</P></DIV></DIV></FIGURE></CENTER><P>In summary, the halorhodopsin drives Cl- inside, then generates negative membrane potential which will drive the import of Na+ given that starvation inhibiting active Na+ export. This design of transport module is shown in Figure 1.3.1. Therefore, the functional expression of halorhodopsin and the depletion of ATP reserve in cyanobacteria could be regarded as the keys to the success of biodesalination.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transformation">Transformation</SPAN></H2><P>We selected two promoters, PcpcG2 and Pdark, to control the expression of halorhodopsin in <I>Synechosystis sp.</I> strain PCC 6803, which correspond to two composite parts (BBa_K1642010, BBa_K1642011) respectively. We applied kanamycin to screen the transformants and test the transformation by colony PCR. The results of colony PCR are shown in Figure 1.3.2.

The forward primer is located in the upstream homologous arm and the reverse one is located in HR.(see detailed construction in Chapter “Composite Parts”) The target fragments for colony PCR of Pdark-HR and PcpcG2-HR are 370bp and 570bp respectively. The numbers at the tail of the sample names are the numbers of our transformants.

The western blotting result of induced culture of PcpcG2-HR compared with non-induced culture shown in Figure 1.3.4 can confirm the control mechanism of PcpcG2 and prove the expression of halorhodopsin. 
</P><P>The profile of halorhodopsin on the gel, which consists of three fractions , had been reported by other researchers (Spudich, E. N., &amp; Spudich, J. L. 1985).There are two retinal-binding polypeptides and their molecular weight are near 25kDa. The lower one of these two proteins is inducible and help with the generation of complete HR function. The other one may be a constitutive protein but chemically differs from haloopsin, the protein moiety of HR. For more detailed reason, please check the paper mentioned above.
