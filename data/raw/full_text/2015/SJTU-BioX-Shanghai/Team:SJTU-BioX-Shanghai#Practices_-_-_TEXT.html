Basic Description
This year, HP takes the lab work one step further by establishing a simple expanded process flow. For this purpose, we conducted several HP projects exploring the problems out of the lab.
Sea vs Brackish Water : We explore the differences between seawater and brackish water as resource in desalination process. Based on that study, we are going to explain why do we think seawater is more potential as a raw material in future and how will our project help in shaping this industry into a new dimension.
Sea Water Restoration : We extracted the knowledge from other iGEM team on desalination process and the restoration of damage caused by it. This study  supported us to care about the theoretical solidity and practical applications.
Bio & RO : We paid a visit to a major company producing RO membrane, the main component of common desalination process which produces fresh water. Based on the visit, we worked and the communication has been established, including the discussion about the differences between our project and RO method, as well as the possibility of cooperation between these two technologies.
Cell-water separation : This is the most important process that is related to safety. Our design is a single-use or one time system. In separation study, we designed both single-use separation & long-term use separation method as well. Furthermore, we also explained how single-used algae can be used further for the production of valuable sub-products.
Public & Government : We really appreciate and value the public acceptance and government support. Thus, we get in touch with both public population and government authority. Further works is conducted to show our efforts in this aspect.
Collaborations : This year we connected with other iGEM team through several small-scale visits and meet-ups. One of our major collaboration is with Nanjing iGEM team. In this part we summarized our collaboration and communication with other teams.
This flow includes the raw material (intake ) , bio-desalination, cell-water separation and further processes(application). To establish it, every step is considered through combination of several HP projects.
