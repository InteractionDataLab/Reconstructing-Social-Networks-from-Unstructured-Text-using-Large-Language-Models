iGEM CONCORDIA 2015
A tool for Synthetic Biology
We endeavoured as a team to develop a protein scaffold that may be easily customized and used by synthetic biologists to perform various molecular processes.
Our Scaffold
Scaffococcus: Scaffold-expressing Lactococcus lactis
The bacteria Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express this scaffold that may harbour a wide range of enzymes.
Diverse Applications
An endless variety of metabolic processes to carry out!
Our Scaffococcus may be tailored to carry out various types of processes, such as breaking down food components that cause common food intolerances, or synthesizing complex industrial goods via synthetic multi-step processes.
