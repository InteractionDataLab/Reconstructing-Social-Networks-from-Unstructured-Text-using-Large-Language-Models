Collaboration
We collaborated with Yale on their handout collating information from iGEM teams that have worked with non-model organisms; the handout being meant to guide and offer future iGEM teams considerations they may utilize if they choose to work with non-model organisms. Our 2015 team was contacted by Yale's iGEM team for input as we used Lactococcus lactis as the organism for our project. We also managed to get members from our 2014 team to fill out the survey as they had experience working with  non-model organisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardti,Chlorella kessleri, and Chlorella vulgaris for their own iGEM project, Clean Green Lipid Machines.
