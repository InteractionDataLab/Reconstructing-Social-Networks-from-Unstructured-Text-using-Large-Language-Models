Chromoprotein Test: aeBlue and eforRed
The first step in testing our extracellular scaffold is attempting to attach a reporter protein to account for its presence and stability. For this purpose, we are using the chromoproteins submitted by the iGEM Uppsala University 2012 team. We chose the two chromoproteins aeBlue and eforRed (respectively BBa_K864401 and BBa_K592012 on the iGEM registry) and fused them to the dockerin domains from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome to allow them to bind to the scaffoldâ€™s cohesins.
After incubation of the chromoprotein-dockerin fusions and the scaffold-expressing variant of Lactococcus lactis, the cells are washed by several rounds of centrifugation and resuspension so that unbound proteins are washed away. After washing, if the colour associated with the chromoproteins remains in the cell portion, the protein-fusions have successfully attached to the scaffold.
This proof of concept allows us to confirm the expression, secretion, and attachment of the scaffold; as well as the integrity of the cohesin-dockerin interaction under standard conditions.
Project Achievements
Successes
Transformed and induced scaffold into L. lactis
Induced, purified and assayed LacZ fused with dockerins
Failure to:
Induce chromoproteins in E. coli (no colour was visible)
Purify SacC and pathway enzymes (assay did not work)
It is possible, that dockerin fusion changes our protein structure and thus caused no colour to appear in chromoproteins and the failure to assay enzymes
Bind enzyme fusions to scaffold on L. lactis
Assay enzyme activity of enzymes docked onto scaffold
