Running an undergraduate research project takes a lot of time and money. The iGEM Concordia team would not have been able to conduct the project without the help of the department and senior researchers at the university.
We would like to thank the Concordia Biology department and Concordia Genomics for providing us with lab equipment, materials and space. Especially to everyone in Dr.Walsh and Dr. Martin's labs for their endless support.
The Biochemistry department for the chemicals and apparatus. Especially to Neema Chirwa for helping whenever she can for supplies and materials.
Also thanks to Audrey Morin for helping us sort finances, sponsors and an innumerable amount of other things relating to the dry lab portion of our project.
We like to give special thanks to our mentors Lauren Narcross and David Colatriano for always being available to help us in our dire needs, and for taking the time to train us in various lab techniques so that we may conduct proper research.
We would also like to thank Jeremy Glass-Pilon and Cory Campbell for being available to answer our questions and showing us new methods in experimental design. And Shoham Mookerjee for his aid and being an extra voice.
We would like to thank Dr. Joanne Turnbull and lab for the generous contribution of chemicals needed to express and purify proteins.
Dr. Andrew Wieczorek, whose doctoral thesis and related research gave us the idea for our "Scaffococcus" project.
Dr. Malcolm Whiteway for his expertise, endless support, and for challenging us to do better.
Dr. Nawwaf Kharma for inspiring us and showing us the broad possibilities in synthetic biology.
Lastly, we would like to thank all our sponsors for supporting young researchers to learn and achieve success.
