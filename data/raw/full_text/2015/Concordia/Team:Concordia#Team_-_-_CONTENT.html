Cell and Molecular Biology 
Motto: “Teammanship”
What I love (and hate) about biology/science: the endless questions you can ask 
What I did: Cloning, Lactis growth, protein expression and purification, protein assays, lab waste management, finance, administration 
Mortal enemy: strikers with barely there flints

Mathieu (aka mathus aka HUSS)
Bio second year 
Motto: iGEM [expletive]!!! 
What I love about biology: DNA. 
What I did: project design, cloning (a lot), expression vector design, parts description, testing
Mortal enemy: whoever throws away my tubes </DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-body"><H3> Kevin Gorjipour </H3>
My name is Kevin Gorjipour and I am a first year undergraduate biology major and the team leader for group 1 (not really significant if my group is just me haha). My greatest fear is using pipet tips and then realizing they have not been autoclaved, I love science because it gives me a better understanding of the universe. My mortal enemy is the bacteria that contaminate my LB. My favorite part about iGEM is the independence of being able to design and carry out our own experiments. I am allergic to cold (and I live in Canada…).Finally, I contributed to this project through many many hours of cloning.

21 years old 
Specialization in Molecular Biology 
Post: Refills materials and stock solutions?Lb/Gel master? 
Thiban, also called Tibby loves the sciences, which is quite obvious.
He loves tea, of all kinds and loves bubble tea even more. 
He knows a lot of random facts and remembers things from the past a little too well. 
He has a habit of asking a lot of questions till the brink that the person is annoyed. 
He is easily bribed with chocolate.

I am 20 years old and in my 2nd year at Concordia specializing in Cell and Molecular Biology. I am a passionate traveler and am eager to study abroad in the future. I plan to apply into medicine at schools across the world after my undergrad in the hopes of becoming a plastic surgeon. I love to play sports, especially soccer. I have played on a soccer team every year since the age of 4! My favourite part of the iGEM project is collaboration and outreach with the community, it’s amazing to be able to share our project with the public and have an effect on those around us.

Degree of study: Biochemistry 
Level of studies: Undergraduate 
Role on the team:  PCR Master 
Interesting thing about you: My great-uncle once hired Bill Gates as a teenager, but he never showed up for work. 
Favourite iGEM project: Concordia 2015 
Ideal bacteria: Some kind of versatile bioreactor </H3><H3> Pavel Solis
My name is Pavel Solis, I'm 21 years old and I'm from Mexico City, so Spanish is my first language. In my free time I study circadian rhythms in rodents and their possible role in Alzheimer's disease, and I also do research on neuroeconomics using optogenetics. Low door-frames, bees and bikes are my worst enemies and my worst nightmare is to be a victim of the three on the same day. I'd love to pursue a career in Biotechnology and live in Germany for the rest of my life. I also like pie. <STRONG>Pie is good.</STRONG></H3><H3> TingLi Lucia Lorigiano
Degree of study: 
Undergraduate; B.Sc Molecular and Cell Biology, and B.A Italian Studies Candidate.
Interesting things about you: 
I am Miss Chinese Montreal, and Miss Chinese International 2nd Runner Up 2014! I am also co-founder of bricobio, Montreal's first community wet lab. I am of both Chinese and Italian descent. I am addicted to coffee and Master Chef. I play bass. Lastly, this is my first time doing iGEM! Aaaaaand loving it so far :)

Your favourite iGEM project: I loved Project Blue Jeans from Berkeley 2013!
Describe your ideal bacteria?
My ideal bacteria would love me unconditionally.
