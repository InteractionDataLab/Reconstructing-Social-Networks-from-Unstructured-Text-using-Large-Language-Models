pET15BB
BBa_K1830000
IPTG-inducible E. Coli Expression vector with RCF25-compatible MCS
pET15BB is a vector designed for expression and purification of proteins of interest from E. Coli. It is derived from the iGEM standard pSB1C3 backbone and so includes a Chloramphenicol resistance selection marker. The LacI operon was added to the backbone for inducible expression as well as a multiple cloning site designed to welcome any part displaying a 5’ NgoMIV and 3’ SpeI cut sites, in accordance with the RCF25 compatibility

PnisA
BBa_K1830001
Nisin-inducible promoter and ribosome binding site
This promoter requires complementation from the Lactococcal nisin operon genes (nisZBTCIPRKFEB). Lactococcus lactis is inherently resistant to the antimicrobial peptide nisin. These two operons are responsible for both the immunity of L. lactis and nisin production. NisA is in fact the gene coding for the nisin precursor and its promoter (PnisA) will express any gene under its control when induced by nisin.

SPusp45
BBa_K1830002
Signal peptide of USP45 for direct extracellular localization by Lactococcus lactis
USP45 is a secreted extracellular protein of L. lactis with no known function and an N-terminal 22 amino acid signal peptide. Use of the signal peptide allows for direct extracellular secretion of any protein of interest.

CBD
BBa_K1830003
Cellulose Binding Domain
This domain is part of the Cellulosome Integrating Protein A (CipA), which forms part of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold attached to the bacterial cell wall and displays cellulose-degrading enzymes (cellulases). For increased cellulose degradation, the cellulosome of C. thermocellum includes a Cellulose Binding Domain (CBD) named CBM3a that brings enzymes and substrate together. This domain is also thought to increase stability of the secreted scaffold.

coh1C3
BBa_K1830004
Type I cohesin domain
coh1C3 is the third type I cohesin domain of the Cellulosome Integrating Protein (CipA), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. These cellulases are fused to a dockerin domain that attaches to the cellulosome through cohesin/dockerin binding interactions. These interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type I cohesin will only bind to a type I dockerin.

coh2S1
BBa_K1830005
Type II cohesin domain
coh2S1 is the type II cohesin domain of the Scaffolding Dockerin Binding protein A (SdbA), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. The scaffold’s components are assembled by the interaction between their cohesin and dockerin domains. These interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type II cohesin will only bind to a type II dockerin.

CWAm6
BBa_K1830006
Bacterial cell wall anchor for Gram+ bacteria
The C-terminal cell wall anchor from the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein contains a conserved LPXTG motif recognised by sortase enzymes for attachment to the cell wall of Lactic acid bacteria.

L. shuttle
BBa_K1830008
Lactococcus lactis shuttle vector part/td>
The Lactococcus lactis shuttle vector contains all the components required for transformation, replication and expression of a vector in L. lactis. For this purpose, it has to be integrated into the vector that you want to transform L. lactis with.

Dock1
BBa_K1830009
Type I dockerin domain
Dock1 is the type I dockerin domain of the Cellulase S (CelS), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. These cellulases contain a dockerin domain that attaches to the cellulosome through cohesin/dockerin binding interactions. The interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type I cohesin will only bind to a type I dockerin.

XDock2
BBa_K1830010
Type II dockerin domain and its 5' X module
XDock2 is the type II dockerin domain of the Cellulosome Integrating Protein A (CipA), part of the Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. The cellulosome is an extracellular protein scaffold that displays cellulose-degrading enzymes. The scaffold’s components are assembled by the interaction between their cohesin and dockerin domains. The interactions are calcium ion dependant and binding is specific, therefore a type II cohesin will only bind to a type II dockerin. « X module » is the name given to the 300bp region located 5’ to the dockerin II domain in the native CipA protein. It favors proper folding of the dockerin domain and improves the ability for the cohesin to bind to the dockerin II domain.
