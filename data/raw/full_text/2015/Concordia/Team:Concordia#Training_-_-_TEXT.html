Training
As mentioned previously, the majority of the teamâ€™s training focused on safety and lab techniques. However as iGEM is undertaken by a team, the students were trained in management and planning by District 3, an innovation center affiliated with Concordia University. This training involved utilizing SCRUM, a unique management and innovation process that is used worldwide by many big businesses. The iGEM team was taught how to brainstorm and communicate effectively, efficiently, and openly, to facilitate project work in a large team.
