1. Purification Procedure Using Centrifugation Introduction
(PureLink Quick Plasmid DNA Miniprep Kits)
Follow this procedure to purify plasmid DNA using a centrifuge. Use a microcentrifuge capable of centrifuging at >12,000 × g.
Isolating Miniprep Plasmid DNA
Harvest. Sediment the cells by centrifuging 1-5ml of overnight LB – culture. Remove all medium.
Resuspend. Add 250ml of resuspension buffer with RNase A to the cell pellet and resuspend the pellet until it is homogeneous.
Lyse. Add 250ml of Lysis Buffer. Mix gently by inverting the capped tube five times. Incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Precipitate. Add 350ml of Precipitation Buffer. Mix immediately by inverting the tube, or for large pellets, vigorously shaking the tube, until the mixture is homogenous. Centrifuge the lysate at >12,000 x g for 10 minutes.
Bind. Load the supernatant from step 4 onto a Spin Column in a 2ml Wash Tube. Centrifuge at the column at 12,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place column back into the Wash Tube.
Wash and Ethanol Removal. Add 700ml of Wash Buffer with ethanol to the column. Centrifuge the column at 12.00 x g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through and place the column into the Wash Tube. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 x g for 1 minute. Discard the Wash Tube with the flow – through.
Elute. Place the Spin Column in a clean 1.5-mL recovery tube. Add 75 µL of preheated TE Buffer (TE) to the centre of the column. Incubate the column for 1 minute at room temperature.
Recover. Centrifuge the column at 12,000 × g for 2 minutes. The recovery tube contains the purified plasmid DNA. Discard the column. Store plasmid DNA at 4°C (short-term) or store the DNA in aliquots at −20°C (long-term).

Working Concentration - 50µg/ml
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Ampicillin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D. It is light sensitive.
Weigh 4g of ampicillin into a small weigh boat.
Add 80ml of milliQ to a 250ml bottle.
Add the ampicillin to the milliQ
Mix/vortex so all the ampicillin goes into solution.
Filter sterilise the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
Store at -20C.

4.  Chloramphenicol
Stock concentration - 34mg/ml in 100% Ethanol
Aliquots - 1ml
Working concentration = 25µ/ml (Stringent), 170µ/ml (relaxed)
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Chloramphenicol is kept at room temperature. It is near our other chemicals
Weight 2.72g of chloramphenicol sulfate into a small weight boat.
Add 80ml 100% EtOH to the chloramphenicol
95% EtOH probably works just fine, but I haven't tried it.
Mix/vortex vigorously so all the chloramphenicol goes into solution.
Aliquot into 1.7ml eppendorfs.
N.B. There is no need to filter sterilize, as it is in EtOH.
Store at -20C.
Go Back To Top
5. Gel electrophoresis 1%/2% Agarose gel preparation
Materials
0.5g of agarose weighed and added to 50ml of TAE buffer
Add 60ml ml of the 1X TAE + 1.2g agarose = 2% gel. Add 60ml 1X TAE + 0.6 agarose = 1% gel.
Dissolve the agarose in the TAE buffer in the microwave. Ensure all the agarose is completely dissolved. Allow to cool slightly (approx. 60°C) and add 1µl of ethidium bromide. Pour gel into gel tray and place comb into position. Ensure there are no bubbles in the gel. Bubbles may be moved to the bottom of the gel using a sterile tip.  Allow gel to set completely. Run gel for approx. 1hour at 100volts.
Measure out the appropriate mass of agarose into a beaker with the appropriate volume of buffer (see below). The volume required depends on your gelbox / casting system -- 50mL makes a good, thick gel for a 7x10cm gelbox.
Microwave until the agarose is fully melted. This depends strongly on your microwave, but a 90 seconds at full power or 3 minutes at half power seem to provide decent results. As long as you do not burn the agarose and nothing bubbles over, this step is robust.
Let the agarose cool on your bench until touching the bottom of the beaker with your bare hand doesn't burn you (~5 minutes for a 50mL gel). At this point add your DNA stain, e.g., ethidium bromide. The beaker will cool unevenly (surface first), so you must be careful not to cause ripples and bubbles.
While the solution is cooling, seal the open edges of your gel box with one long piece of masking tape on each side. Make sure it is sealed well or the gel will leak.
Pour the agarose solution into the taped gelbox. Carefuly pop or shove to the side any bubbles, put in the comb, and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid.

6.   Preparing competent cells
Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium with 1 ml vial of seed stock and grow at 20°C to an OD600nm of 0.3
This takes approximately 16 hours.
Controlling the temperature makes this a more reproducible process, but is not essential.
Room temperature will work. You can adjust this temperature somewhat to fit your schedule
Aim for lower, not higher OD if you can't hit this mark
Centrifuge at 3000rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.
Flat bottom centrifuge tubes make the fragile cells much easier to resuspend
It is often easier to resuspend pellets by mixing before adding large amounts of buffer
Discard supernatant by pouring out slowly and pipeting remaining supernatent
Gently resuspend in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer
sometimes this is less than completely gentle. It still works.
Incubate on ice 20 minutes
Centrifuge again at 4°C and discard supernatant as described above.
Resuspend in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
Test OD of a mixture of 200 µl SOC and 50 µl of the resuspended cells.
Add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0-1.5 in this test.
Aliquot to chilled screw top 2 ml vials or 50 µl into chilled microtiter plates
Store at -80°C indefinitely.
Flash freezing does not appear to be necessary
Test competence (see below)
Thawing and refreezing partially used cell aliquots dramatically reduces transformation efficiency by about 3x the first time, and about 6x total after several freeze/thaw cycles.
Measurement of competence
Transform 50 µl of cells with 1 µl of standard pUC19 plasmid (Invitrogen)
This is at 10 pg/µl or 10-5 µg/µl
This can be made by diluting 1 µl of NEB pUC19 plasmid (1 µg/µl, NEB part number N3401S) into 100 ml of TE
Hold on ice 0.5 hours
Heat shock 60 sec at 42C
Add 250 µl SOC
Incubate at 37 C for 1 hour in 2 ml centrifuge tubes rotated
using 2ml centrifuge tubes for transformation and regrowth works well because the small volumes flow well when rotated, increasing aeration.
For our plasmids (pSB1AC3, pSB1AT3) which are chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistant, we find growing for 2 hours yields many more colonies
Ampicillin and kanamycin appear to do fine with 1 hour growth
Plate 20 µl on AMP plates using sterile 3.5 mm glass beads
Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies
Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 105/µgDNA
We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 5x108 and 5x109 cfu/µgDNA

14.  RDP Assembly Protocol
Note: Before beginning, briefly centrifuge all parts and solutions contained in microfuge tubes and mix thoroughly. Tubes that have sat in the fridge for a while will evaporate and condense liquid up at the cap. This step restores the original volume and concentration of the sample.  Organise the RDP parts
Consult the circuit design. Post a copy of your RDP circuit design so you know the right order of assembly.
Arrange your RDP parts. Put your DNA tubes in the right order. Bead Washing
The Process of bead washing is illustrated below:
Resuspend Bead pull-down pellet Remove Wash
Begin the assembly by gently mixing the bead-anchor stock solution by pipetting it slowly up and down (avoiding bubbles) until homogenous.  This method minimizes the splashes of other more vigourous methods that strand droplets up the side of the tube.
Immediately transfer 5 µL of the mixture to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.
Add RDP Wash buffer (WB).  Add 50 µL of RDP Wash buffer and mix as above. Pulse the liquid down briefly in a low speed microfuge.
Place the tube in a magnet cradle and wait for the solution to clear, by allowing the beads to collect on the tube wall next to the magnet. Wait 20-30 seconds until the solution fully clears.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Remove and discard liquid.  Place the pipette tip at the bottom of the tube at the opposite side from the bead pellet. Remove all liquid, including any droplets on side of tube and discard.
Perform a second wash by repeating steps 5-7.
Couple the first part to the anchor part
Add first RDP part and ligation master mix.  Add 5 µL of the first part in your design to the bead pellet, then add 5 µL of the ligation master mix.  Mix gently as described above taking care to avoid splashing.
Incubate for 8 minutes at room temperature.
Block unreacted ends
Blockers (Blk-X and Blk-Z) are used to deactivate unreacted ends that can lead to errors at subsequent stages of the assembly.
Add 5 µL of the appropriate Blocker to the existing reaction:
Blk-X, if you just added an X-Z’ part.
Blk-Z, if you just added a Z-X’ part. Note: Adding the wrong Blocker will kill the assembly!
Mix gently and incubate an additional 2 minutes.
Wash 2 times
Repeat steps 3 through 8.
Mark off the coupled part on your circuit diagram.  On your sketch, cross off the part you just coupled so you can keep track of what step you are on.
Couple the second and all subsequent parts
Repeat steps 9 through 14 for each remaining part, finishing with the Cap.
Elute the DNA from the magnetic bed
Resuspend the bead pellet in 20 µL of RDP Elution buffer (EB).
Place in magnet cradle.  Let stand 5 minutes, and pull down the magnetic bead.
Extract the assembled DNA.  With a pipette, extract the supernatant containing the assembled DNA.
Add RDP Storage buffer.  Add 20 µL of storage buffer to neutralize the sample for transformation and gel analysis.
Go Back To Top
14.  PCR-Based RDP Parts Creation Protocol Bsa1 digestion protocol
BsaI Digestion
This step creates the RDP ends in the RDP orientation that you specified in GENtle in the New RDP Part tool.
Add 10µL of NEB CutSmart Buffer and 2µL of BsaI-HF (40 units) to the cleaned up DNA (75 µL). Mix and centrifuge briefly to pull down any splashes and eliminate any surface bubbles. Incubate at 37OC for 3 hours
DNA Cleanup
This step inactivates and removes BsaI and the small flanking fragments that are released on cleavage.
I)  Add 0.5mL of DNA binding buffer (PureLink B2 binding buffer) and vortex.
II)  Place a Synbiota spin column into a 1.5mL microfuge tube, then load the entire sample and let stand for one minute. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13K rpm, then discard the flow-through.
III)  Add 200µL of wash buffer (W1) to the column. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14K rpm, then discard the flow-through. Repeat the wash step, and discard the flow-through.
IV)  Place column into a clean microfuge tube. Add 100µL of Elution buffer (Qiagen  EB). Let stand 1 minute, then centrifuge for 1 minute at 14K rpm. Do not discard the column. It can be reused for steps v) and vi).
V)  Repeat steps i) to iii) by adding 0.5mL of PB to the DNA eluted in step iv).
vi)  For the final elution step, add 25µL of TE buffer to the column. Let stand 1 minute, then centrifuge for 1 minute. Repeat elution with another 25µL collected into the same tube.
At this stage your part is almost assembly-ready. The next step is to adjust its concentration appropriately to a value expressed as picomoles per microliter (pm/µL) as described below
Measuring and adjusting the part concentration
In the RDP assembly protocol, PCR parts are used at a concentration of 0.04 pm/µL per reaction, for a total of 0.2 pm in 5µL. Concentrations of 0.02 pm will work but doubling the ligation time is advised. Concentrations greater than 0.04 pm pose no problem and may be advantageous. However adding more means less sample for subsequent builds so why not stick with 0.04 pm/µL?
I)  If you have access to a Nano Drop or equivalent, first determine the concentration of your part in ng/µL using 2µL of the recovered sample. Zero the instrument using the same TE buffer that was used to elute your sample.
II)  Determine the remaining volume of your sample.
III)  To convert the concentration of your part from ng/µL to pm/µL(pm/µLPart), use the very close approximation: 1 pm/ µL= 670 ng/µL divided by the length of the part (kb).
IV)  If the concentration significantly exceeds 0.04 pm/µL, then adjust the recovered volume of your sample (µL recovered) with TE buffer using the formula below:
Added vol (µL) = [25 x pm/µLPart x µL recovered] - µL recovered
As an alternative, the gel-based method described below, can be used to approximate a workable concentration.
v)  Set up an agarose gel as described above, and prepare a gel sample of the digested DNA, add 1µL of the DNA to 9µL of load mix (LM).
vi)  Load the entire sample into a centrally located well.
vii)  Load 10µL of the DNA ladder to one side of your sample and 15µL to the other side.
viii)  Following electrophoresis, photograph the gel at the lowest possible exposure where all bands remain visible but where gel background appears as dark as possible.
ix)  To determine the minimum concentration of your sample, compare your product band to the nearest sized ladder band in either or both ladder lanes that has an intensity that is closest or lower than yours.
For the 10 µL load, all bands correspond to 20 ng of DNA except for the 500, 1000 and 3000 bp bands, which correspond to 60 ng. For the 15 µL load, all bands are at 30 ng of DNA except for the 500, 1000 and 3000 bp bands, which are at 90 ng.
x)  The value that you decide on represents the minimum concentration of your sample expressed as µg/µL.
xi) Use the formula described in step iii) to convert the concentration to pm/ µL.
xii)  If the minimum concentration of your sample significantly exceeds 0.04 pm/µL. then dilute it as described in section step iv).
xiii)  Store the remaining RDP Part DNA at ~4oC and remember to centrifuge it briefly before each use.
Part Validation
To determine how well your part works in RDP assembly, incorporate you part into a simple RDP assembly that begins with an Anchor part and ends with a Cap part. If your part is in the X-Z’ format then start with dA20-ChlrR-X’ and finish with Z-Ori.3-dT20. If your part is in the Z-X’ format then start with dA20-ChlrR-Z’and finish with X-Ori.3-dT20. Follow the protocol described in the RDP Assembly section.
The plasmid that results from this build is very similar to iGEM’s pSB1C3. Therefore this exercise will not only establish your part’s quality but will also provide with a plasmid where the part can be both sequenced and archived.

16.  PCR-Based RDP Parts Creation Protocol PCR Protocol
PCR Amplification
Primer Preparation
Upon receipt of your RDP part primers, briefly centrifuge each tube to bring the solid material to the tube bottom. Resuspend each primer to a final concentration of 25nm/mL (25µM) in TE buffer using the formula:
Resuspension volume (µL)= nm (from supplier label) x 40
Vortex at maximum setting for 10 seconds, let stand 10 min then repeat twice. Briefly centrifuge and freeze until needed.
Note: Keep track of your PCR primers, since you may be able to use some of them to sequence RDP parts in assembled circuits. Store frozen.
Template preparation
If the starting template for the final RDP part is contained within a circular vector such as a plasmid, then linearize it by choosing an appropriate restriction endonuclease whose site is located in the vector backbone but not within the part sequence. PCR amplification from a linear template increases the final yield of the PCR product while reducing the level of lower- band contaminants.
Since the PCR reaction uses 2µL of template @10ng/µL, digest 100ng of DNA in a final volume of 10µL. Add 2µL of the digest to the PCR reaction just prior to amplification as described below.
Reaction setup
The parts creation protocol requires a minimum of 5µg of PCR product that should be easily obtained from a 100µL reaction as described below:
Keep all reagents on ice
Using a thin-walled 0.2 mL PCR tube, combine in the following order:
2µL forward primer
2µL reverse primer
20µL 5x HF buffer  (Master Mix 23 µL (QS High – fidelity Master Mix – NEB))
2µL dNTPs (@10mM)  (Master Mix 23 µL (QS High – fidelity Master Mix – NEB))
71µL H2O
2µL template
1µL Phusion polymerase (@2u/µL)  (Master Mix 23 µL (QS High – fidelity Master Mix – NEB))
Mix the reaction by pipetting up and down gently to avoid bubbles. Centrifuge (pulse) briefly. Then keep on ice until amplification.

Cleanup
Use the standard Qiagen spin-column cleanup procedure (or equivalent), noting the procedural modifications described below. Do not use the spin columns provided with the RDP kit. They have a special cleanup role following the BsaI digestion step.
When the Qiagen PB buffer mix is added to the column, let stand one minute before centrifuging (or filtration if using a vacuum manifold).
Following the Qiagen PE buffer wash step, elute the DNA from the column into a 1.5mL microfuge tube using 50µL TE buffer, then repeat with a second 50 µL elution into the same collection tube yielding a final volume of ~85-90µL.
Determining the quality and quantity of the PCR Product
For a more accurate measure, use a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (or equivalent small-volume device) if available. Use 2 µL of the recovered sample. Remember to zero the instrument using the same TE buffer that was used to elute your sample.
If a NanoDrop spectrophotometer is not available, use the procedure below.
Product size and purity
i)  For products with an expected size of 0.2-10 kb, set up a 1% agarose gel using a 1:50 dilution of 50x TAE stock buffer (Tris-Acetate-EDTA @ 2M ) in deionized H2O for both the gel and running buffer.
ii)  To prepare a gel sample of your PCR product, add 1µL of the DNA to 9µL of load mix (LM). Note: In order to minimize the interference of dyes with subsequent band quantification, only bromophenol blue has been included at considerably lower than standard concentrations to mitigate the masking of bands in the 300-600 bp range.  Store remainder of PCR product at 4°C.
iii)  Selecting two of the most central wells of the gel, load 10µL of the provided DNA markers (ladder) and the full 10µL sample prepared in step ii) above. A gel figure of the DNA ladder, including band sizes and amounts (ng) is provided below.
iv)  Following electrophoresis, stain the gel for 15 min with ethidium bromide, SYBR Green, or RED Safe, using whichever method is standard to your lab.
