The 2015 Westminster iGEM team made a decision to host the official UK meet-up when it was noted that UCL, who have organized it in the past, were not arranging it this year. However, we did not fully appreciate the work involved in organizing such an event. There were people to invite, venues to secure, guest speakers to find, and finally our own results to finish and compile before the meet-up. Paulina, one member of our team, contacted iGEM to enquire about the potential of Westminster arranging such a meet-up. Once we had agreed on the dates, iGEM was notified, and the 2015 UK iGEM meet-up event planning commenced.</P><P class="teamleft">
The Westminster iGEM ELECTROCOLI friendly neighbourhood hosts!
The UK meet-up was a fantastic platform for all the UK teams to network, familiarise themselves with other iGEM projects and build professional relationships. It also provided an opportunity for all the UK teams to gauge the standard of work that is expected of each team attending the iGEM Jamboree

The team had also invited some exciting guest speakers to present over the course of the two days. 
On Friday, we had Dr. Paul James from University of Exeter and Dr. Paul Freemont from Imperial College London. 
On Saturday, we had three guest speakers- James Phillips from Synbiota, Edward Perello from Desktop Genetics and finally Sean Ward from Synthace.
 Each speaker was inspiring, memorable and enthusiastic. A range of topics were covered by the guests speakers that raised a lot of questions during and after the presentations. Teams were informed of the current developments in statistical and laboratory technologies, and were able to seek advice from the guest speakers regarding their own projects.
</P><P class="teamleft">
We provided everyone with food and refreshments throughout the event. Being a very culturally diverse team, we decided to bring a bit of spice to the UK meet up with an array of home cooked dishes such as samosas and pkoras. Coscto proved to be a beacon of light for our team who were on a strict budget. At the end this dining experience was our very own iGEM inspired cake. All in all, the catering was a success.
</P><P class="teamright"><B>EVENT DIARY</B>
Day 1 of the UK meet up proved that you can only prepare so much. The teams arrived earlier than expected, catering was being manually carried across a busy main road and who can forget the misspelling of our team T-shirts.</P><P class="teamleft">
The official UK iGEM meet-up was opened by Dr Mark Odell who gave a witty and 

warm welcome to all the teams in order to get the event underway. This was followed by 

a couple of brief words by Dr. Robert Scott, as seen in the image below.
