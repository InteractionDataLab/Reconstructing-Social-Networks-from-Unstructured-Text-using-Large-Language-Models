Engaging with the public and other synthetic biologists
2015 Bay Area Maker Faire Synthetic biology as part of the Maker Movement
In May 2015, our team held a booth at the 2015 Bay Area Maker Faire. We discussed our team's project ideas, previous Stanford-Brown teams' projects, and synthetic biology as it fits into the Maker movement more broadly. We also led interactive activities such as origami folding and DNA extractions, and had posters with questions such as "If you could make anything with biology, what would you make?" with opportunities to write and draw answers. This was a great opportunity for us to get feedback from the public on our project ideas.
Poster sessions and presentations Interacting with other researchers
We participated in poster sessions and gave presentations throughout the summer to showcase our work and learn from our peers. Our audiences included the the students at the NASA Ames Advanced Studies Laboratories, the participants of the Sierra Systems and Synbio Symposium, and the recipients of the Stanford Bioengineering Research Experience for Undergraduate grants.
