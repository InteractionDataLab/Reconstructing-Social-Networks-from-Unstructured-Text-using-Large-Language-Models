Gold Medal Requirements
Expanded on our silver medal Human Practices activities by integrating questions and feedback we received from our interviews into the design of our project.
Collaborated with the University of Edinburgh iGEM team by sending them sheets of cellulose for them to characterize cellulose binding domain performance on sheets made with different processing methods.
Improved the characterization of the Imperial College 2013 team’s Hybrid promoter phaCAB by testing it in a different strain of E. coli and documenting our results on this Part’s Experience page.
We have created a functional prototype of our product. Almost.
Silver Medal Requirements
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part of Device of our own design and construction works as expected.
Submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Demonstrated how our team has identified, investigated, and addressed how our project could be used in space missions, and used interviews with experts to help guide the design of parts of our project.
Bronze Medal Requirements
Registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and will attend the Giant Jamboree.
Completed and submitted our team’s Judging form.
Created and shared a Description of our project using the iGEM wiki, and documented our parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Will present a poster and talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Created a page on our wiki for attributions for each aspect of our project.
Documented at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submitted it to the iGEM Registry.
