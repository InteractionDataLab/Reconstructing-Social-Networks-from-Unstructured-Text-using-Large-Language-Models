This also gave us the opportunity to get the perspective of Dr. Meg Lowman (&quot;Canopy Meg&quot;), a rainforest canopy researcher, on uses for biological, self-folding objects in her line of work. We were invited back to hold a demonstration of biOrigami in the museum, during which museum goers were invited to experiment with folding sheets of thermoplastic using an infrared lamp. We provided Shrinky Dink sheets and different colors of markers, explained the molecular mechanisms behind folding using heat, and asked participants to predict what shapes would be created from their designs. Members of our team were also interviewed and filmed by media specialists at the Cal Academy for a video on synthetic biology and our iGEM team that will be released soon.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7" id="be3"><H2 class="featurette-heading">2015 Bay Area Maker Faire <SPAN class="small">Synthetic biology as part of the Maker Movement</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">In May 2015, our team held a booth at the 2015 Bay Area Maker Faire. We discussed our team's project ideas, previous Stanford-Brown teams' projects, and synthetic biology as it fits into the Maker movement more broadly. We also led interactive activities such as origami folding and DNA extractions, and had posters with questions such as &quot;If you could make anything with biology, what would you make?&quot; with opportunities to write and draw answers. This was a great opportunity for us to get feedback from the public on our project ideas.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row featurette"><DIV class="col-md-7 col-md-push-5" id="be4"><H2 class="featurette-heading">Poster sessions and presentations <SPAN class="small">Interacting with other researchers</SPAN></H2><P class="lead">We participated in several poster sessions and gave presentations during the summer to showcase our work and learn about the work of our peers at Stanford, NASA, and other school in Northern California.

We are grateful to have been able to interview several scientists from NASA, the Rhode Island Space Grant, and Brown University. Four of their interviews were video taped, and are available to watch here.
