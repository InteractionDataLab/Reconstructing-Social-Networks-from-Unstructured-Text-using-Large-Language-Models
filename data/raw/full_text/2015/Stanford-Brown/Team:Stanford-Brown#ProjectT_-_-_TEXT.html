How are we doing this?
Imganine the elimination of petrochemicals in the production of plastics. Now imagine that in space. See below to see our Projects.

Who are we?
A group of strange and funny looking students who decided to spend the summer stuck in a lab together aka the Stanford-Brown 2015 iGEM Team

Our Vision
Imagine the ability to produce plastics without petrochemicals. We wanted to engineer bacteria to become bioplastic factories so on space colonies plastics could be produced and unilized.

How are we doing this?
Bioplastics, substrates, cellulose, CRATER, PHA, Polystyrene, Biopigments. Wow. Much fold. Very NASA.

Substrates
Substrates? More like contraints! Hmmmmmm
Cellulose
Man this cellulose stuff is smelly. Hopefully we can use this as a substrate some howw.......

Bio-Plastics
Look at this we are working on two plastics. The first is polystyrene, and the other is P(3HB)
Polystyrene PHA
Folding Mechanism
This is how we do it.
Bio-Pigment
With the infrared light and bacteria produced pigment... WE CAN RULE THE WORLD BWAHAHAHA

Spores aka HYDRA
Spores are sooooo silly. Bacilus Subtilus and everything.
Learn about HYDRA
CRATER
SHALL RULE THE WORLD
See how Danny, Kirsten, and Jack? revoluationize synthetic biology forever!!!! Click below to find out more :D
CRATER!!!!!!
