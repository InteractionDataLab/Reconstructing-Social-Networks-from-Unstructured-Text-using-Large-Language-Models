Reminiscence
Our Story
"iGEM IIT Delhi" is a dedicated lot of students, who have this unquenching thirst for Synthetic Biology. The team, comprising of students from various disciplines, is mentored by the highly experienced research associates and faculty of our college. It is this "Never Give Up!" attitude which proves to be the strongest similarity among each of us. We have worked in a committed manner, with the best of our efforts. But hey, it was not just about the work! We guys did enjoy the time spent together. This summer of 2015 will certainly be the best part in our album of life.
Mentors
Manisha Lamba
PhD, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I am a PhD scholar at Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology. I am passionate about learning new things. For me working with iGEM was a great learning and teaching experience. I was always there to provide guidance and assistance to the team whenever required.
Omkar Vinchure
Phd, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Varsha Ashok Walvekar
MS (Research), Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead. I'm a firm believer of putting on small efforts and tilting the odds for making changes. I'm someone who is extremely tenacious and devoted. Once I've defined my benchmarks, I take necessary steps to achieve those milestones.
Shuddhodana Mukta
Final year master's student majoring in Biochemical Engineering.
I've known iGEM since my undergrad days, as a synthetic biology enthusiast with an inclination towards metabolic engineering, I always wanted to be a part of an iGEM team. As soon as I learnt about iGEM team at IIT Delhi, I decided to be part of it.
Responsibilities: Lab, strategy making for experimentation and execution, troubleshooting.
TEAM
Chandel Angad Singh
Fifth Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
The basic motivation for me be a part of iGEM is that here we can work the way we want. From designing the strategies to encountering every single problem which comes in our way, it's all us. We have the liberty to work on our own and that's the most important part of the team. The actors become famous by the movie they act in, while it’s the director who makes the movie famous! I am the director in this case.
Nikhil Patidar
Fourth year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Initially, I was involved in introducing new faces with lab basics and later on carried on with creative team as thought provider. Pioneered in conceptualizing the wiki, tour, poster, banner and presentation.
Arpit Dhupar
Mechanical E8ngineering Graduate, working in FITT.
I am highly passionate for clean energy solutions. This passion became the driving factor for getting involved with the project of Igem-Iitd.
I took the responsibility of designing and developing proof of concept prototype that could work in conjunction with bacteria designed by team and explore future possibilities of scaling up the model.
Kshitij Rai
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Aniruddh Yadav
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
"A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work." - Colin Powell. I started off working with the Lab part of the team with the aim to learn as much as I could about Lab work relating to synthetic biology. I've always had the dream to pursue my further studies in the field of biology, and iGEM has helped me immensely in gaining a lot of experience.
Shreya Pal
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I joined iGEM due to my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I've loved doing the lab and modelling work. iGEM has given me a small glimpse of what the future holds for us and what a revolutionary field I'm working in.
Surbhi Singhla
Third Year Undergraduate, Chemical Engineering.
Shashank Garg
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
I am the kind of boy who wants to explore things. And for me, the best part was the fun which we had in all these days. Literally speaking, I lived these days. And regarding my involvement, I worked in Prototype Designing. I was actively involved in Human Practices and did put a decent amount of effort in managing stuffs.
Souhardya Roy
Second Year Undergraduate, Chemical Engineering.
I dream a lot. And I work hard to make them true. That's me.
At iGEM, I worked in the Lab team and tried my hands at modelling. Towards the end, I also helped in developing some of the contents.
Vinay Kamuju
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Being a part of iGEM, I got an amazing exposure in the field of Synthetic Biology. It was fun working with such an amazing team, and I did have a lot of things to try my hands at. I worked in the lab team, basically dealing with the troubleshoot part. Also, I was actively involved in the modelling team and in Human Practices as well.
Shubham Goel
Second Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Prakhar Agrawal
Second Year Undergraduate, Computer Science and Engineering.
I work in the web development team of the club.
I like learning new things!
Yatish Aggarwal
Third Year Undergraduate, Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.
Aparana Gupta
Second Year Undergraduate, Chemical Engineering.
I love working for society and towards its welfare.
I handle the the web part of the club.
Sociologist
Mahendra Shahare
Science and technology studies (STS) scholar, and doctoral candidate at the department of humanities and social sciences IIT Delhi.
I am exploring the emergence of synthetic biology in India, and it was a great honour that iGEM IIT Delhi team invited and welcomed me. As a sociologist of science, it had been a great learning experience for me to observe the way a group of young people took up this new mode of knowledge construction. Their passion, perseverance and never give up attitude - given the lack of resources they face - enriched my own work in multiple ways and proved out as an excellent site for a STS scholar.
