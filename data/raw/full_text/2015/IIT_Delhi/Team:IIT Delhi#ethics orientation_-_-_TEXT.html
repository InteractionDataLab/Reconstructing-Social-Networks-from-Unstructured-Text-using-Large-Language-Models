iGEM Orientation (January 2015)
The team organised an orientation with the purpose of discussing the scope and future of synthetic biology in India and IIT Delhi as well as increasing awareness about iGEM . This event was attended by students from the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels, pursuing various disciplines including Computer Science engineering, Electrical engineering, Biological sciences among others.
Orientation for freshmen (July-August 2015)
iGEM Team IIT Delhi kept an orientation exclusively for the freshmen joining in the fall semester 2015. The session involved our team members introducing concepts of synthetic biology to the freshmen and to tell them about iGEM. This was essentially done to help the freshmen develop an interest in synthetic biology and hopefully carry on the iGEM Team IIT Delhi legacy forward.
