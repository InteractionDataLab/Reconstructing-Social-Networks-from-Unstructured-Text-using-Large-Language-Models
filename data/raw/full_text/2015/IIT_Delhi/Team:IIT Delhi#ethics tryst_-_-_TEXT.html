Tryst (February-March 2015)
Tryst is the annual science and technology festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. iGEM team IIT Delhi set up a stall, which was aimed at encouraging and promoting synthetic biology by using a myriad of ways to do this.
The team set up an on spot DNA extraction technique which allows any person to see the DNA extracted from their saliva or a fruit (banana and strawberry) with their naked eye. The team also displayed its iGEM project from the 2014 jamboree. A fun quiz called bioathlon was also organized which included prizes for the top 3 entries. iGEM Team IIT Delhi was awarded the 1st runner up prize in the ‘Best stall in Tryst 2015’ category.
