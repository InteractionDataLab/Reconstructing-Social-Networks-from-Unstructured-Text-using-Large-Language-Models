For Bronze:
We registered for iGEM, and are going to attend the Giant Jamboree.
We have completed the Judging Form.
We have created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and documented the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We are going to present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have created a page on our team wiki with a clear attribution of each aspect of our project, following all the necessary criteria as per the instructions.
We have document a new standard BioBrick Part, which is central to our project and are going to submit this part to the iGEM Registry, adhering to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
For Silver:
We have experimentally validated that our BioBrick Part as well as the device (of our own design and construction) works as per the expectations. Apart from that, we also documented the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry.
We submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our team has identified the issue of Pollution in general. We have investigated the effect it has through numerous surveys carried out in different parts of Delhi. We are implementing our prototype in project "Aanch" of Enactus. And finally, we have published a documentation on Pollution to make people aware of the seriousness of the issue.
For Gold:
We are mentoring the iGEM IIT Kharagpur team, participating for the first time in the Giant Jamboree Competition.
We have improved the characterization of our previously existing BioBrick Part.
We have designed a functional prototype of our project.
And finally, we integrated the issues raised during the surveys, through necessary changes in our design.
Acknowledgement
A few months back, it was a dream. Today, it’s a reality. The transition didn't come by our efforts alone. There are people who didn’t hesitate to spend their valuable time on us. And we certainly do owe a lot to them.
We are sincerely thankful to Prof. Shaikh Ziauddin Ahammad and Dr. Stefan Oehler from the Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology for their constant support. We are grateful to Prof. Biswajit Kundu and Prof. James Gomes from the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences for their valuable advices which helped us a lot to strategise our work plan.
We are thankful to Prof. Anurag Sharma, Dean, IIT Delhi, for allowing us to use the UG lab (Biotech) and Prof. P.V.M Rao for letting us the access to Workshop, IIT Delhi. We are also thankful to Garima Goyal (Protein Engineering Lab) and Anamika (RNA 2 Lab) for allowing us to access to their labs.
We are also thankful to the Rishabh Mathur, Mayank Sahu, Shashank Yadav and Rishabh Verma, previous members of iGEM IIT Delhi, for their valuable advices at different points of time.
