Enactus
Enactus IIT Delhi is basically related to Social Entrepreneurship, and deals with the various issues of social importance. Presently, they are working on project "Aanch", where there primary focus is to reduce the smoke coming out from the "chulha"s used for burning stuffs in rural areas. "iGEM IIT Delhi" has collaborated with "Enactus IIT Delhi" in project "Aanch", where we focus to install our prototype over the "chulha" to reduce the pollution caused by the harmful smokes emitted from them. Together, we aim to take the collaboration further, and implement it over a large scale.
