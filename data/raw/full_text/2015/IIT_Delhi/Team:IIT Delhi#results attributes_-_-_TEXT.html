Acknowledgement
A few months back, it was a dream. Today, it’s a reality. The transition didn't come by our efforts alone. There are people who didn’t hesitate to spend their valuable time on us. And we certainly do owe a lot to them.
We are sincerely thankful to Prof. Shaikh Ziauddin Ahammad and Dr. Stefan Oehler from the Department of Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology for their constant support. We are grateful to Prof. Biswajit Kundu and Prof. James Gomes from the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences for their valuable advices which helped us a lot to strategise our work plan.
We are thankful to Prof. Anurag Sharma, Dean, IIT Delhi, for allowing us to use the UG lab (Biotech) and Prof. P.V.M Rao for letting us the access to Workshop, IIT Delhi. We are also thankful to Garima Goyal (Protein Engineering Lab) and Anamika (RNA 2 Lab) for allowing us to access to their labs.
