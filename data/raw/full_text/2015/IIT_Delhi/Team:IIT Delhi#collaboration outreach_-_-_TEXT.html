Delhi Government
Our team went on to meet with the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, to talk about collaborating with our team. As a consequence, Delhi Government has agreed to implement the project at a larger scale all throughout Delhi. So, basically, our project is going to affect the lives of people in an entire state, and what else can be a bigger achievement for us!
Not only that, we also made sure that the ethical restrictions on synthetic biology be eased out, thereby allowing a higher research scope and better outcomes. And, finally made him aware of the present scenario of Synthetic Biology, and made it a point that it gets publicised in a proper fashion all throughout India.
The literal impact our project can have on pollution control and the potential it has was enough for our Government to assure their tie up, which certainly is a big step taken ahead.
NSIT Visit
Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, is a leading institution of higher technical education in India. Our team went there to display our iGEM project, apart from preaching the idea of Synthetic Biology. It was an eye opener for most of the students as most of the concepts were new for them. They took deep interest and participated actively. We also conducted a survey with a different questionnaire and handed a copy of our documentation on Pollution, so as to make them fully aware of entire issue. Finally, we gave them an insight into the working of iGEM IIT Delhi, and encouraged them to be a part of our team next year. The spirit and enthusiasm shown by them was a sure indicator of the influence our visit had on them.
