Open House (April 2015)
Open house is an annual event in IIT Delhi which aims to promote and increase awareness about new technologies specifically for school children. iGEM team IIT Delhi put up a stall in this event with the goal to motivate and encourage school students to develop a greater interest in Biology and Biotechnology. We also gave a basic introduction about synthetic biology and iGEM with the hope that it might motivate some of them to enrol as the first high school team to participate in iGEM from India.
