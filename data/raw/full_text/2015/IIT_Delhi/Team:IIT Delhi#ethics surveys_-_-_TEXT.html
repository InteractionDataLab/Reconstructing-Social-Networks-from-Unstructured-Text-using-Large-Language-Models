Surveys (August 2015)
iGEM Team IIT Delhi conducted some surveys to get an idea of the level of awareness among the citizens of Delhi, and getting an insight into the basic health and mental issues faced by the people by virtue of living in the most polluted city in the world. This was done in Central Park in Connaught Place, New Delhi and Munirka village. This was a really eye opening experience as we realised that the basic level of awareness is very low among the common people of the city. The details of the surveys have been enclosed in a separate document.
