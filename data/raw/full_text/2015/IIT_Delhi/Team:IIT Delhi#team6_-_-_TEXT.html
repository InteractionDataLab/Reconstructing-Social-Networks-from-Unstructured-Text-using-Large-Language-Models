Our Project
The Problem:
The world these days has turned into a junkyard of wastes. In today’s world, greenhouse gases such as NOx and SOx pose a global challenge to our sustainability which needs to be addressed on an immediate note.
Being greenhouse gases, both NOx and SOx have a good hand in Global Warming, the most challenging problem at these days. Considering the present rate of rise in temperature, the world’s certainly at the stake of destruction.
These oxides increase the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere which is responsible for the photochemical production of ozone in the lower layers of the atmosphere which has detrimental effects.
SOx is the main precursor of air pollution which is a deteriorating problem for all of us.
Producing acid rain and acidified soils, Sulfur Oxides not only result in respiratory problems such as asthma and pneumonia, but also destroy farm crops, buildings and environment, causing huge economic losses every year.
Both NOx and SOx also have detrimental effects on the environment.
An Innovative Solution:
Our team, iGEM IIT Delhi, plans to combat this catastrophic effect using one of the most promising field of research, Synthetic Biology.
Firstly, we aimed to come up with a strain of engineered bacteria (using Synthetic Biology) which converts harmful components of an exhaust gases coming out of chimneys of various industries and car exhausts into harmless by-products. And as a matter of fact, we have been successful in achieving this far. However, we have given a parallel thought about improving the efficiency and durability of the bacteria and also about including further gases with harmful consequences to be reduced as well.
Secondly, we are aiming to build a working prototype using innovative techniques of mechanical and chemical engineering, thus giving an inter-disciplinary dimension to our project.
The reactor which we are designing can be used on a multi-purpose basis like :
Diesel Generator
Car Engine
Industrial Purposes
This done, all that remains is to incorporate our genetically engineered bacteria into the prototype which will give the final touch to our project and allow us to offer the world with a unique solution to address air pollution!
