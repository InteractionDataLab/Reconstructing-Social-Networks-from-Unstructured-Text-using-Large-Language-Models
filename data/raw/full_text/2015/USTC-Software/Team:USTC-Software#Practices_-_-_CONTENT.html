	Having been developed for more than a decade, synthetic biology has undergone considerable growth in scope, expectation and output, and has become a widely recognized branch of biological research. Our team put in great efforts to raise public awareness of exciting opportunities, heartening achievements and marvelous promise in the field of synthetic biology.
	</P><H2>Technological Activities Week</H2><P id="TAWP1">Technological Activities Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities.
This year, Technological Activities Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC-China and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge.

In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could learn knowledge while having fun.

Over 30 iGEM teams from the Greater China Region attended the conference and 4 members of our team---Chen Xinan, Yuan Xiaofan, Wu Ziyu, Cui Tianyi was sent to the big gathering.	
	</P><P id="TACT1">During the conference, our team made a team introduction and a project presentation to the iGEMers. We received lots of feedbacks from them as well as beneficial guides from the professors of other universities. Not only have we established friendship with other teams in advance, but also we realized where our defects lie and what our future work should focus on. It can be said that we really benefited a lot from the worthy experience in NCTU. We are so grateful to be offered the precious chance to communicate with other teams before the final contest.

In the meeting, every team introduced their project, including motivation, progress and the problems that need to be addressed. Besides, we exchanged the ideas about what the Synthetic biologists need and what software teams should do to assist them to design the circuits.
