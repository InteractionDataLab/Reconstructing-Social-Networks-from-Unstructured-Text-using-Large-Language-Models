	E3: <SPAN class="exp">Yes, we inherit and develop the idea of 2007 team of USTC, they developed many Boolean gates and planned to employ knowledge from digital circuit to create cascade of Boolean gates. And our software reuses the framework of last year's USTC-Software team and the separation of front-end and back-end completely and REST API as the interface between them. Moreover, developers could easily develop their own software based on our project. More specifically, we could provide developers an easy-of-use API for further development. Here are the two examples below.
<PRE>* Graph API. Software engineers could easily use our python code to build a gene circuit based on a truth with just a few lines. 
More specifically, developers just use the code `import biocircuit` to import our package and then use the following code to 
converting a truth table(a string) to some gene circuits with score.
        expr_from_back = biocircuit.string2expr(expr)
        circuit_from_back = biocircuit.create_circuit(expr_from_back)
        scores_from_back = biocircuit.circuit_score(circuit_from_back, biogate.d_gate)
        
* Simulate API. If scientists find a better way to simulate a gene circuit. He could just easily replace the algorithm with his 
owns. With the same interface, no changes should be made to the other components. The API could be seen below.
    system_data = biosystem.bio_system(request.data)
    system_data.simulation()
    response_from_back = system_data.record_list
Below is a well-formated example of the bio_system API
```
system_data = {
    &quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;NOT2&quot;, &quot;INPUT&quot;],
    &quot;arcs&quot;: [
        {&quot;from&quot;: 1, &quot;to&quot;: 0}
    ],
    &quot;system_parameter&quot;:

                ]
            }
        },
        {
            &quot;device_parameter&quot;: {
                &quot;initial&quot;: [
                    0
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


We also have auto-generated API documention for further development. See http://ustc.software/docs For REST API for the 
frontend for data exchange. See our github README to know how to generate the python API for backend.
