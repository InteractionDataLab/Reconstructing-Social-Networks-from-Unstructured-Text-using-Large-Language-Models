Sequencing Results
M1-12(1C3):
1: BAD (VR is bad; no priming)
2: good
3: good
4: good?
Further inspection reveals BBa_K525998 T7-RBS is present in the beginning. The sequence is otherwise correct. This is suspicious, and we will do a Restriction test to verify proper length.
ERRATA: All these sequences, while correct, are not the appropriate size. These are in fact, M1-9(1C3) and M1-9(T7) plasmids.
ICA for M1/2[1:1]-12
Followed previous ICA protocol using:
45 minute initiator binding time.
3 minute ligation times for each step.
Elute in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20 at 95 C for 5 min.

Results
Cast 1% TAE gel to visualize. Used 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1PCR amplification of M1/2[1:1]-12 ICA eluate. Both lanes are identical reactions. The expected size for 12-mer amplification is 1324 bp. The most prominent band in both reactions is a ~1.3 kb band. There are accessory bands corresponding to 3-, 6-, 9-mers as well.
This result indicates that ICA for M1/2[1:1]-12 was successful.
Large Scale Liquid Culture for M2-AB, BC, CA
100 mL of each. Picked a single colony from freshly streaked plates. Used the old version of M2 monomers for this.
