Gut-on-Chip
Introduction
To demonstrate a functional prototype of our project, we decided to show our system working under real-world conditions simulated in the lab using a Gut-on-a-Chip design similar to the one described in:

The idea is to model the rate at which our genetically engineered bacterial culture (E. Coli Nissle) grows and colonizes the gut, and to characterize its expression of 5-HTP, a serotonin precursor that acts as an anti-depressant, in the device. Dr. Chiang, from UCLâ€™s very own Microfluidics Lab, has already drawn up the 3d design described in the attachment using SolidWorks.
Dr. Paul Sharp, who works with human intestinal epithelial cell models at Kings College London, has kindly agreed to collaborate with us on this project, give us the Caco-2 cells we need, and advice us on the best ways to culture them. We then decided to improve on the original Gut-on-a-Chip designed at Harvard University by making it a more realistic mimic of reality and more financially feasible.The new design doesn't require a porous membrane, and is inspired by Dr. Marco's (UCL Biochemical Engineering) bulging bioreactor. It has been designed under the guidance of Dr. Paul Sharp. In addition to replicating the peristaltic motion of the longitudinal muscles in the intestines like Harvard's design, this model will also replicate the motions created by circular muscles.
The microfluidics device will be initially tested using Monkey Kidney Epithelial Cells, which are very similar to Intestinal Epithelial Cells (Caco-2). Experiments were carried to determine the optimum seeding cell density of the cells, and the time they need to adhere.
Monkey Kidney Fibroblast Cell Culture:
Protocol for Determining Optimum Seeding Cell Density:
Cells were pipetted into a 96 well plate with cell densities reducing by half in each following column (8 replicates) After 3 days, the cell confluency was checked under a microscope to determine the optimum level.
Column: Cell Count

Negative Control
Protocol for Determining Adherence Time:
Cells were pipetted into a 96 well plate at the optimum seeding density At intervals of 1 hour, the medium from 1 column was removed The cells were stained with DAPI, and cell counting was done under the microscope.
