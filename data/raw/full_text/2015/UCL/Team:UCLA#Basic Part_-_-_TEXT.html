Best Basic Part
BBa_K1763444 is our highest quality part: it is extremely well documented, from construct generation, to purification and expression of our final recombinant peptide, to even validating complete and proper function of the module.  We hypothesized that when the module containing sfGFP would spin with silk dope in small concentrations, the silk would fluorescence in fiber form.  As our micrograph analysis and stress/strain analysis indicates, we have successfully produced a silk fiber and fluoresces, consistent with proper function of sfGFP.  Our pat is extremely innovative, in that it can be extremely modularized to fit any functional domain of interest from the Registry of Standard Parts, and that any team can quickly screen these functional domains for proper function when processing silk, instead of having to produce direct silk fusions.  This product is extremely useful to the community, as the first novel peptide used to add new biochemical functions to silk structures.
