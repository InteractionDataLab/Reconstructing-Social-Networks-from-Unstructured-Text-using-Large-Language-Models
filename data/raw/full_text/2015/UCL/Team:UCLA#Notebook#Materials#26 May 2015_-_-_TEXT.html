started a new PEG dialysis
100 grams PEG in 900 mL water
10 uL of 5.4% aqueous silk in a dialysis cassette. Silk was loaded into cassette via an 18 gauge needle.
dialysis started at 3:50 pm
dialysis ended at 12:10 pm, May 27
dialysis time was 20 hours and 20 minutes
managed to obtain around 1 mL of concentrated silk from the cassette
Irregular morphology of the needle spun cellulose acetate
Due to these irregularities, discard of needle as a viable spinning mechanism.
