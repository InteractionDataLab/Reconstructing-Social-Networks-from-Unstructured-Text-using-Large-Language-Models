ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Degummed more silk (2.5 grams)
pipetted 100 uL of the dialyzed silk from Tuesday to determine concentration
Spun more cellulose acetate (same conditions from yesterday)
prepared LiBr solution (16 mL, 9.3M)
took light microscope images of the fibers obtained yesterday
The spun fiber is approximately the same diameter as the PEEK tubing. For reference, the inner diameter of the PEEK tubing is 127 um.
However, note that the fiber is non-uniform. This is an image of a different spot along the same fiber. This part of the fiber is likely thicker because the dope bent while coagulating in the bath.
