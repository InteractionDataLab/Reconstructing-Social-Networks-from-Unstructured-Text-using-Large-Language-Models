Agar plate preparation
IPTG-induced protein expression
On the afternoon before the induction, start seed culture with appropriate antibiotic from glycerol stock and leave to incubate overnight at 37C shaking
The next morning, use 2 µl of seed culture to inoculate 100 ml of fresh media with appropriate antibiotic in shaker flask and grow until an OD600 nm of 0.4-0.6 is reached
If necessary, prepare these in the meantime :
- 50 ml stock of  lysis buffer (25 mM TRIS-Cl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.6):
weight 0.151g of Tris base
add 45 ml of water
titrate with HCL to pH 7.6
fill up to 50 ml with water
add 29.2 mg of EDTA
- IPTG 100 mM stocks: (23.8 mg IPTG per 1ml ddH2O )
When culture reaches OD of 0.4-0.6, add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM (=100ul of 100 mM stock)
Incubate induced culture at 30 °C for 4 hours
Split the culture into 4 falcon tubes (~25 ml each) and harvest the pellets by centrifugation for 20mins at max speed
Resuspend each pellet in 2 ml of  lysis buffer, lyse by sonication (10 cycles of 10 sec with 10 sec breaks)
Centrifuge 20 min at max speed.
Transfer all supernatants to separate tube
Measure the concentration of protein in supernatant using Bradford Assay
Store in the freezer

Gut on Chip
Fabrication of the upper and lower microchannel
Pour 3g of 15:1 (wt:wt) PDMS mixture onto the bottom of the petri dish and spread across evenly.
Place the master on the PDMS with SU-8 facing up and wait 10mins on an even surface.
Pour 15:1 (wt/wt) PDMS mixture onto the silicon master and degas it in a vacuum desiccator for 30min. use 15g and 3g of PDMS for the fabrication of the upper and lower microchannel slabs.
Fully cure PDMS in an oven maintained at 60c for at least 4 hours
Peel the cured PDMS off the master, and cut it into a 2-cm wide x 3-cm long rectangular block using a scalpel.
Punch holes through the upper channel layer by using a biopsy punch with a diameter of 2mm.
Fabrication of porous membranes
Pour degassed 15:1 (wt/wt) PDMS mixture into an empty petri dish to gener4ate a 1-cm-thick flat PDMS slab.
Cure PDMS in a levelled dry oven at 60c for 4 h
Use a scalpel to cut the fully cured PDMS along the edge of the petri dish, and remove it from the dish by using tweezers.
Rinse the removed PDMS slab with 100% ethanol, and dry it completely using compressed nitrogen or air
Treat the PDMS slab with oxygen plasma for 1.5 min, and salinize it in a vacuum desiccator overnight
Place a silicon master containing an array of micro fabricated circular pillars (10µm in diameter and 30µm In height) with a centre to centre facing of 25µm at the centre of the bottom surface of a clean petri dish
Pour 3g of degassed 15:1 (wt/wt) PDMS mixture into the wafer, spread it evenly. Avoid the formation of bubbles.
Gently put a salinized PDMS slab from step 5 on the surface of the silicon master covered with uncured PDMS. Release the slab very slowly to prevent the formation of air bubbles
Place a frosted glass slide on the salinized PDMS block, and place 3 kg weight on the glass slide.
Wait for 30 min to allow for intimate contact between the PDMS slab and micro fabricated master surface. Perform this step on a level surface.
Move to the entire assembly to a dry oven at 60c and incubate it overnight.
Remove the sample from the oven, take off the weight, and cool the assembly to room temperature over 30 min
Use a scalpel to lift up a corner of the slab, and slowly peel it from the wafer. Apply 100% ethanol to the gap between the PDMS surface and the silicon wafer during this step to facilitate the detachment of the PDMS layer.
Alignment and Assembly of the micro device
Clean the upper PDMS layer and the porous membrane with packaging tape. Do not apply excessive pressure when you are cleaning the membrane surface, in order to avoid unwanted damage of the device and delamination.
Treat the membrane surface and the channel of the upper PDMS layer with the plasma by using a corona generator for 3s and 1min, respectively.
Use sweeping motions to achieve uniform treatment, and keep the tip of the electrode of the corona generator 5 mm away from the sample surface for best results.
Overlay the upper microchannel layer on the PDMS membrane, and bring them in contact. Press the PDMD slabs to permit intimate contact between layers and remove trapped air.
Incubate the assembled layers in the dry oven at 80 co. for at least 12h
Remove the sample from the oven, and cool it down at room temperature for 1h
Cut along the edges of the upper PDMS channel layer bonded to the membrane by using a scalpel, and gently peel the salinized flat PDMS from the assembly.
Put a few drops of 100 % ethanol between the layers for easier detachment.
Tear off the portions of a porous membrane located over the lateral vacuum chambers using fine tip tweezers under a stereoscope.
Expose the membrane surface and the channel side of the lower PDMS layer to the corona under a stereoscope.
Align and bond the device. Attempt to pull apart the upper and lower PDMS slabs to qualitatively determine the success of device bonding. Incomplete or unsuccessful bonding results in peeling off and separation of the PDMS slabs
Bend the tips of six 18 – gauge blunt needles by 90 co. by using pliers, and break off the needle at a point near the syringe entry port.
Insert the needles into the access ports of the central cell culture channels and side vacuum chambers.
Cut six pieces of 4 – cm long silicone tubing, and connect them to the free ends of the needles
