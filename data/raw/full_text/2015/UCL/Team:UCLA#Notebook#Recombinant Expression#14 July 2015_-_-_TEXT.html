AGENDA
BCA Assay
Complete BCA assay for acetone precipitation protein fractions from Monday's pooling and concentration of eluted fractions from Fraction #1 of the 1L Tamura outgrowth.
Add 1mL WR to each of the 13 samples, vortex gently to mix, and incubate at 37 degrees for 1 hour.
Remove and let samples cool to RT.  Transfer samples into 1mL cuvettes.
Using the BCA Standard protocol in the spectrophotometer, measure both the blank, the standard samples, and the protein samples of interest using the machine readout.
Write down all absorbance values given and the predicted ug/mL concentration value given as well.
IMAC Batch Purification of Fraction #2
Follow the protocol listed on last Friday for proper purification of the fraction.
Will use the equilibrate resin used last week for Tamura.
Logistics
Order deoxycholic acid, lysozyme, imidazole, and protease inhibitors for the purification steps.  Order through the Engineering requisition form.
Instruct J on downstream work until next Monday (in essence, preparation of a 1L Tamura batch that will be lysed, extracted, and purified at a higher concentration.
Continue brainstorming fundamental design tips.
RESULTS

Figure 1: Scatterplot of Standards fitted with a Linear Regression Line.
The resulting linear fit equation (y = 3E-07x+ 0.0877) was used to estimate the protein concentration of the unknown wash and elution fractions of the previous purification, as well as the concentrate formed using the pooled fractions described above, centrifuged in the protein concentrator. This equation was calculated where x is the protein concentration, and y is the absorbance value emitted by the spectrophotometer.
