Protein Yield
Yield from 8/7 silk purification
BCA assay
Based on the interpolated Absorbencies from the BCA assay the concentration of our 8/7 silk is approximately 0.78 mg/ml in around 12 ml of solution, giving a conservative 9 total mg of protein for a 300 ml culture.
This is an improvement over the 7/29 purification where we got around 1.6 mg/ml in only 0.75 ml of solution from a 100 ml culture.
