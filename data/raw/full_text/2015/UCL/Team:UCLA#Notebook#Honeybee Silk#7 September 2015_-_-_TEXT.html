Redo of SDS PAGE
SDS PAGE to assess different lysis protocols
Last time I used the wrong running buffer.
Remade the running buffer as follows
(1x MOPS running buffer)
Component
Mass (g)
Tris Base
6.06
MOPS
10.46
SDS
1.0
EDTA
0.3
Ph was 7.6 before adding in the SDS, used ddH20
Vinson says SDS screws with the pH meter.
