1.1 Miniprep samples from yesterday
1.2 PCR amplify M1-12
1.3 Double Digestion of M1-12 PCR product with EcoRI and PstI

Miniprep samples from yesterday
Sequencing results:
M1-9(T7)
Colony 1,2 and 4 have the correct sequence
PCR amplify M1-12
Since previous PCRs using ICA elution as template did not work very well, first M1-12 PCR product was also tested as a template

Ran samples on 1% gel
Sample 1 with had no band  Sample 2 had a very bright band close to the expected size
Maybe it was the ICA elution that was no longer in good condition?
Gel purified the band from sample 2
