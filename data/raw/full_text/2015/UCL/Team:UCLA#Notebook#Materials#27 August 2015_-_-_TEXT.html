Spinning with the godet, attempt 1
90% v/v Isopropanol coagulation bath
We first tried a godet speed of 15.67 steps/second
Yesterday, we tried to measure the speed at which the fiber comes out of the tubing and obtained ___.
godet was way too slow. The thread drooped to the bath floor and the thread coming out of the PEEK tubing was just bunching at the bottom.
Tried bumping the speed all the way up to 15.6719 x 14
This cut some of the slack in the thread
However, I observed something strange: it seemed that the faster that the godet reeled the thread, the faster the thread came out of the tubing
So it never happened as we envisioned -- that the thread would be taut coming out of the PEEK tubing
Spinning with the godet, attempt 2
I was frustrated with the godet, so I had the idea to reel the silk around something that I could spin with my hands. Used a 25 mL pipette
I used tweezers to pick up the fiber and wind it around the pipette
I spun the pipette slowly at first, but realized that the fiber in the bath was still slack
I then started spinning the pipette as fast as I could -- remarkably, the fiber tolerated this, and was still slack in the bath!!
Spinning with the godet, attempt 3
Hands getting tired. I decided to let the motors do the work.
Set up the godet outside of the bath. See picture.
Silk spinner or shitty Rube Goldberg machine?
Here's the weird part, the fiber ended up being kind of slack-ish?
The thread would drop vertically down from the PEEK tubing as it emerged
But before touching the floor, it would be pulled upward towards the surface
Right below the thread, there would be some white stuff. Not sure what it was -- water? silk stuffs? It dispersed when agitated with tweezers.
Occasionally, the thread had imperfections (i.e. clumps)
Regardless, we got a fair amount of thread.
seriously, a small volume of dope yields a crazy long length of thread.
Retroactive edit: On August 28, I collected the fibers from the godet. It glows, kind of? It's near impossible to tell when placed on plastic.
