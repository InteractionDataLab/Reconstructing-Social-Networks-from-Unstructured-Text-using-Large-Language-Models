Inoculation of Tamura Colony
Plates were streaked a few weeks ago with transformed E-coli cells containing an alternating sequence of wild type silk and GFP, specifically: N-terminus-GFP-C-terminus. An isolated colony was picked and inoculated in Lysogeny Broth (commonly referred to as Luria broth, an excellent growth medium for bacteria) overnight for 16 hours. Three colonies were picked, hence three start-up cultures were prepared. This allows us to selectively choose the one with the most optimal OD to continue with our plans to grow up an entire Liter of Tamura.
Procedure
Colony picked with micropipet and inserted into a culture tube containing 10 mL of LB and 10 ul of Ampicillin.
