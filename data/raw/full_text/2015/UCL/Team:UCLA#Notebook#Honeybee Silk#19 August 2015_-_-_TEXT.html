The samples were run on a 1% agarose gel against 1kB ladder. Expected band size: ~2100bp
Results:
[insert gel image here]
Samples 1, 4, and 8 had the cleanest bands, these three samples are going to be inoculated.
Inoculation of Sample 1, 4, and 8
The remaining 99uL of the suspended cells were each inoculated in 5mL LB broth with 5uL 1000X chloramphenicol.
