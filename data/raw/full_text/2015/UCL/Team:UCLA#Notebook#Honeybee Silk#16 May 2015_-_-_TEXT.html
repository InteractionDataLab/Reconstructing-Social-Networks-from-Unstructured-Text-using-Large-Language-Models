Plating Bacteria for Honeybee Silk Protein Expression
I am plating these bacterial glycerol stocks in order to get colonies, which I will inoculate in order to express and purify our honeybee silk protein.
Plated cells on choramphenicol agar plates using glycerol stocks of regulatory elements + silk#3 coding
Out of the three tubes of glycerol stocks, I used tube #1 on plate #1 and tube #2 on plate #2.
I spread the bacteria using a bacterial streaker instead of beads
