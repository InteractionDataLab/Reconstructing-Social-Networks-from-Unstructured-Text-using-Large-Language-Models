We are conducting ligation tests between all possible combinations using T4 and T7 ligase
2 NotI Concatemers
Sri suggested using NotI to digest the plasmids and create a super plasmid that contains multiple copies of the monomers.
Testing NotI digestion today using 2CA with the protocol below.

3 Results
Cast 200 mL of a 1.5% TAE agarose gel to visualize results of both BsaI and Not1 digestion.
FigureÂ 1: Digestion Results: The 100 bp bands were excised as well as the second band in the NotI digestion.
