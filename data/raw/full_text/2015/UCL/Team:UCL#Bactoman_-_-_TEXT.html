Bactoman
Bactoman is a comic aimed to introduce our project to a younger audience. Set in a dystopian future where the mentally ill are excommunicated and abandoned by the society, Nathan Navaro takes the mantle of Bactoman to challenge the broken society. Bactoman utilises synthetic biology to help people with mental disorders!
