Transformation Results
Colonies are present on all plates from yesterday .
Miniprep
Used Zymo Classic kit to prep M2-9(T7) and M2-SeqAB
Concentration (ng/uL)

M2-Seq AB
1117.69
1.88
Sent M2-9(T7) samples for sequencing using VF/R primers as needed.
BsaI Digestion for M2-Seq AB
Digest 5 ug of M2-SeqAB plasmid in 50 uL reaction with 4 uL of BsaI.

Ran digest on 1.5% TAE gel. Used 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1BsaI Digestion of MaSp2 Seq AB. The Expected product size is 102 bp.
The digestion worked, but it is not as complete as previous digestions have been. Compare to previously .
Midi prep for M2-AB
Used Qiagen Kit, eluted in 200 uL EB.
Approximately 100 ng/uL for each)
May need to only digest 4 ug of each in the future.
Bacterial Culture
Picked three colonies from each plate from yesterday .
Grow in 5 uL liquid culture.
Streaked one plate with all three of the M2-9(T7) samples we sent for sequencing.
