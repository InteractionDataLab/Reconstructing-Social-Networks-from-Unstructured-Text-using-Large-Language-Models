Day of Successes
The sequencing for Silk in bl21 came back good. Here are the results, under allignments in the right column.
Our transformation of the T7 promoter and and silk in psb1c3 also seems to have worked, as we have colonies now.
We will sequence the above construct and send it in to the registry by Friday
We can now start expression of our honeybee silk as soon as our order for DNAse comes in.
