Attempt and Fail of spinning aqueous Tamura
component
volume
total mass
silk (140 mg/mL)
750 uL
105 mg
Tamura (2.97 mg/mL)
70.7 uL
0.21 mg
Note that the initial silk concentration was 140 mg/mL.
After adding Tamura, it dropped down to 127.9 mg/mL.
Dangerously low....
Tried a spin
70% v/v ethanol coagulation bath
initially tried to pump at 1 uL/min
waaaaaay too slow. Rough calculation says that it would take over 10 hours to spin the entire thing
we bumped up to 16 uL/min (Lewis paper recommendation)
this 12.8% w/v dope is not concentrated enough to spin
a fiber would come out, but it's too fragile to pull over to the godet
So now, we're left with ~2 mL of 14% w/v silk
According to the Lewis protocol, "We find that storing the silk for a few days will allow it to reach the required concentration."
So we'll let it sit over the weekend and see if it increased in concentration.
