Sequence Verification
ICA MaSp2 3-mer
All are good
MaSp2 6-mer
Sequence failure for 1, 2.
Sequence 3 is good.
MaSp2 Seq AB
1: BAD: single bp deletion
2: GOOD
3: BAD: 20 bp insert
Restriction Enzyme Digestion, Subcloning Preparation
Subcloning 3-mer and 6-mer into BBa_K525998 for expression.
Cloning 9-mer into pSB1C3 for sequencing and biobrick making.

Ligation for Transformation Preparation
Ligate MaSp2 3-mer, 6-mer into BBa_K525998.
Ligate MaSp2 ICA 9-mer into pSB1C3.
Used Ligation Calculator with the following parameters to determine relative DNA amounts:
vector size: 2200 bp
vector amount: 50 ng
insert size:
3-mer: 406 bp
6-mer: 712 bp
9-mer: 1018 bp
3:1 ratio of insert:vector
Ligation in 20 uL reactions with 1 uL of T4 Ligase.
Ligated at 25 C for 25 min, then heat kill at 65 C for 10 min.
Transformation
2 uL of ligated product MaSp2 3-mer, 6-mer were transformed into BL21(DE3) chemical competent cells.
Plated all the bacteria onto chloramphenicol plates.
3 uL of ligated MaSp2 ICA 9-mer were dialyzed against ultra-pure water.
Transformed 2 uL of MaSp2 ICA 9-mer into DH5(alpha) electrocompetent cells.
Plated all the bacteria onto chloramphenicol plates.
