ENTREPRENEURSHIP
20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol succeeded
nominal extrusion rate of 16 uL/min
I say nominal because the screw drive clearly isn’t advancing
I see now why professional fiber spinners use piston pressure instead of a drive screw syringe pump
I had to pull the coagulating mass out of the way of the dope that was continuing to advance out of the PEEK tubing
hence, at some points the fiber is thinner (but still intact)
nevertheless, even without pulling on the dope, a fiber would still form right out of the tubing
Some confounding variables:
I have no idea what pressure the pump is applying to the syringe since the drive block is not moving at all
Time may be a variable: this had been pumping for a long time before this particular experiment. Maybe all of the air bubbles from yesterday have already been purged?
Things to take care of next:
construct a robust set up where dope coming out of the tube will have adequate space so that it doesn’t hinder the dope coming out of the peek tubing
try it on silk!
construct a post-spin stretch system. This will alleviate the problem of coagulated dope interfering with dope that’s still coming out
additionally, we’ll need to have this set up anyway for silk
Once again, tried 20% w/v dope extruded into 70% ethanol, this time with the syringe pump oriented vertically
gravity pulled already forming fibers out of the way, allowing fibers to continue to form.
