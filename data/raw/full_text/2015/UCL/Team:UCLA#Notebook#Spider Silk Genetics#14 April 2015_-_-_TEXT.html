1 MaSp2 Polymerase Chain Assembly
Set up 2 50 uL reactions following the same protocol from yesterday scaled to 50 uL for 2AB. We included the following modifications:
∙ Annealing temperature: 64 C
∙ 25 cycles instead of 20
∙ Used primers 2A-F, 2B-R
2 Results
Cast 1.5% TAE agarose gel. Used 3 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Figure 1: Each band corresponds to 25 uL reaction of MaSp2.
This protocol works better than the one previously. The target product at 170 bp is clearly more intense. While there is still some primer dimer formation, we will stick with this protocol.
