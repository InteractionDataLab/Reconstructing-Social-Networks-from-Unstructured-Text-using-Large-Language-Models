MEASUREMENT STUDY
Attempt and Fail of spinning HFIP Silk
30% wt/vol HFIP dope, as instructed in the recombinant spider silk protocol
component
volume
total mass
lyophilized silk
N/A
134 mg
HFIP
447 uL
N/A
Tamura (2.970 mg/mL)
90.24 uL
0.268 mg
OBSERVATIONS
When the Tamura was added, small liquid bubbles appeared on the surface of the HFIP. They looked kind of like oil bubbles on water
I think that the bubbles are water that isn't mixing with the HFIP
This makes no sense though -- Wikipedia states that HFIP is miscible with water
Other sources corroborate that HFIP should be miscible with water. After all, the main point of HFIP is that it's crazy strong at hydrogen bonding
Alternatively, maybe the bubbles are protein aggregates? They look so liquid though
After about an hour or so, there were two pieces that were still solid in the liquid
I poked at them with a pipette tip to try to push them and dissolve them
They behaved exactly like gels
After about another hour, the solid pieces still weren't dissolving, and the Tamura was just sitting on top of the solution.
I vortexed to try to dissolve the solid pieces and to mix the Tamura in. The same protocol by the Lewis group states that vortexing to mix the dope is ok
After about another hour, I tried to pipette the dope to place into the syringe
the damn dope had gelled up and I could not pipette it.
POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE GELATION
vortexing
the fact that I used a pipette tip to mix the dope around
addition of water in the Tamura
THINGS TO TRY FOR NEXT TIME
Chop up the lyophilized silk into smaller pieces
I placed large chunks of silk into the HFIP today
Concentration Dialysis
Started at 3:00 PM
Aim for 17 hours on the concentration dialysis, so end it at 8:00 AM tomorrow
I'm doing 17 hours because so far, even 19 hours has caused the silk in the cassette to gel.
ANOTHER NOTE: I accidentally made the concentration solution 100 g PEG in 1000mL water, instead of 100 g PEG in 900mL water, as the protocol states. So I fucked up, this causes less osmotic pressure on the cassette, so honestly I won't be able to tell if it was the lower osmotic pressure or the shorter concentration time that makes a difference tomorrow.
ENDED at 8:10 AM the next day
Enormous differences!
The dope was so much easier to remove from the cassette
I believe that I removed most, if not all of the silk in the cassette (~3 mL)
It's not as viscous as the dope usually is when extracted from the cassette.
Pipetted 100 uL to test the concentration.
There was 0.014 grams in dried silk, meaning 14mg/100uL = 140mg/mL = 14% w/v.
