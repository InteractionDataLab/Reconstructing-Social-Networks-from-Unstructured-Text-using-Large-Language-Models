Honeybee Inclusion Body Purification
Pre weigh two 50 ml falcon tubes
Split the culture into two 50 ml falcon tubes.
Mass balance and spin down cells at 5300 rpm 4C for 15 minutes.
Decant supernatant, and make sure to get rid of as much liquid as possible.
Record the weight of the pellets.
Transfer pellet to one falcon tube.
Resuspend in 5 ml/g of pellet Bug Buster (1x) by pipetting and gently vortexing.
Put on shaker or rotating mixer for 15 min at RT.
Take first fraction, F1 of this full cell lysate.
Centrifuge 16000 g 20 min at 4 degrees C
Take second fraction of this supernatant which should contain soluble proteins, while our desired protein should be in the pellet.
Resuspend in the same volume of 1X Bugbuster as above.
Make sure the pellet is completely resuspended!
Take Fraction at this point (F2) Cell lysate #2
Add DNAse (1 ul) and let rotate 20 min.
Add dry lysozyme to concentration of 200 ug / ml
Let incubate on ice 30 minutes, swirl every 5 min.
Add 6 volumes of 1:10 diluted bugbuster (.1X)#*
Can split up into two falcon tubes if necessary.
Centrifuge 16000g 15 min. 4 degrees C to collect inclusion bodies.
Collect supernatant as fraction S2. Inclusion body should be the pellet.
Resuspend pellet in 1/2 volume of original 0.1X bug buster solution
Mix to get an even suspension by pipetting and vortexing for several minutes and spin down as in step 9.
Take supernatant fractions for each wash step.
Repeat step 15-16 two more times.
Resuspend inclusion body pellet in 3% SDS solution and incubate at 60 C in the water bath for 2 hours.
Store at 4C for further processing and analysis.
