Finishing up the concentration dialysis
8:11AM: withdrew 100uL from the cassette. It seems too dilute.
Ended up withdrawing the silk from the cassette at around 11:00AM... That's about a 21 hour concentration... Why did it not gel up? Is it because of the slightly less concentrated PEG (100g in 1000mL instead of 900mL water?)?
Ended up being 16% w/v.
Spinning Tamura
In any case, we spun 250 uL of it. Because this is fairly dilute silk, we could only add Tamura in a 1:750 Tamura:Silk ratio. Final dope concentration is 15% w/v.
Spin at 10 uL/min, into a 70% v/v EtOH bath
It suuuuuucks.
We got kind of frustrated. Switched to a 90% v/v Isopropanol (IPA) bath.
IPA seems to work very well
We indirectly measured the rate at which the silk comes out of the PEEK tubing by timing the rotation of tweezers as we collected the thread around it. We found 12 tweezer rotations in 26 seconds, where each "rotation" is a 180 degree turn. This translates to 7.3846 mm/s.
