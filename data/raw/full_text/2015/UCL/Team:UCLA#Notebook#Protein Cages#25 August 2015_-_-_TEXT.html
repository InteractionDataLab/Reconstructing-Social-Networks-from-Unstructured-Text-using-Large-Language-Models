Judging
Today Phil and I tried dynamic light scattering (DLS) with our version of Yeates' original cage and Mutant #10. Phil's older samples (purified 4 days prior and thawed twice) were very aggregated and the initial attempt to pipette a sample clogged the tip. My M10 sample (purified 1 day prior and thawed once) were somewhat aggregated, albeit not as extensively.
We pooled all three elutions of the original cage and filtered it and elution 2 of M10 with a .1 micron filter using a centrifuge. M10 elution 3 was kept unfiltered since it was the least aggregated sample.
DLS was performed with the filtered original, filtered M10, and unfiltered M10. Results below:
