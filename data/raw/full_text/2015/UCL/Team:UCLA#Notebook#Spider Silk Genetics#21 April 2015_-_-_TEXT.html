1 Ligation of MaSp 2AB, 2BC, 2CA in to pSB1C3
∙ Used ligation calculator to determine amounts of each insert to use to ligate into 50 ng of vector for a 3:1 ratio of insert to vector.
∙ 2000 bp vector, 170 bp insert.
∙ Determined 12.75 ng of insert to 50 ng vector. Proceeded with ligation using protocol below:
2AB (43.28 ng/uL)
2BC (34.56 ng/uL)
2CA (34.9 ng/uL)

2 Bacterial Transformation
∙ Used 2 uL of each reaction to transform 50 uL competent cells.
∙ Incubate on ice 5 min.
∙ Add 200 uL of pre-warmed SOC to each tube.
∙ Rescue for 10 min.
∙ Plate 50 uL onto chloramphenicol plates. Incubate at 37 C overnight.
3 MaSp2 PCA
∙ Set up 2x 50 uL reactions for AB, BC, CA each using protocol from 4/13/2015 scaled to 50 uL with the following modifications:
∙ Annealing temp: 64 C
∙ 25 cycles instead of 20.
