InterLab Study
Our team
consists of a lively mix of UCL students (and a high school student!). We come from variety of backgrounds but share the passion for synthetic biology. Get to know the people who stand behind the success of this iGEM project.

Marta Napiorkowska
I am a recent UCL graduate with degree in Biotechnology who loves engineering life and is looking forward to be the part of the future shaped by synthetic biology. I am not quite sure how I happened to come up with the initial idea that then developed into our amazing project. My role in the team is to be a portable robotic platform for cloning and to help in creating an (almost) seamless wiki. In the future I want to continue tinkering with DNA in the lab and hopefully make some real world impact with it.
Jack Ho
I just finished my BSc in Molecular Biology and I love synthetic biology, EDM and burritos. Hence I joined the UCL iGEM team. I became interested in synthetic biology for its potential to solve real world problems and its diverse applications. I spend most of my time in the lab doing lots of lab things like cloning or something (I once used 42 falcon tubes!). When not in the lab (like never), I like to work on the wiki and modelling. Also, I drew the logo on the T-shirts we're wearing! :)
Lucas Von Chamier
I am a second year Natural Scientist, doing Physics and molecular Biology. I am interested in the fundamentals of the world, especially the origin of life and the make-up of atoms. This is essentially what interests me about synthetic biology and what made me take part in iGEM. Apart from science I am into 80s punk rock, birds and Kebab. I contribute to the team primarily with the world famous German sense of humour and secondly with my computational and lab skills.
Paloma Portela Torres
BSc Molecular Biology (2nd Year) I only found out about iGEM when the UCL 2014 team had already been formed, and ever since, I have held on to the idea of it as my little joy to look forward to. I enjoy learning how to make things, talking to people and taking pictures of the two. In iGEM I hang out in the lab, trying to do things quick and not make it too untidy. Once the lab closes I try to get in touch with people or play around with illustrations and videos.
Francisco Guimaraes
Second year biochemical engineering student. Interested in startups, innovation, programming, evolutionary biology, economics and understanding why things are the way they are. Former-future MD. Mostly involved in the entrepreneurship, human practices and software aspects of the project.
Mariola Sebastián
I’m a 1st year Biotechnologist, who loves biohacking, computers, and business. I have been working in the lab to get bring some cute synthetic bacteria to life. I have also been working on the commercialization of our project, and creating a startup that will knock your socks off.  In my free time I like watching funny movies, reading sci-fi, and designing machines.
If you see me in the Jamboree, come talk to me about entrepreneurship, astrobiology, and robot uprisings, or if you just want to change the world.
Marta de Lebrusant Fernández
I am a 1st year Biotechnologist and I decided to join iGEM in the first place because I love playing around with E.coli and the smell of agar plates. Besides being with my beloved colonies in the lab I enjoy working on Policies and Practice and organising events for our project. Once I get home I love chilling eating M&M’s, watching movies with Minions or reading comics. If you are interested in immunology, evolutionary genetics, saving the planet or you just love synthetic biology, I am the right person to talk to.
Yash Mishra
Yash Mishra of the House Parashar, the First of His Name, the Legend, Lord of Ligations, Polymath of the Old Smoke, Patron of Policies and Practice, Destroyer of Colonies, Grandmeister of Microfluidics, Father of Bactomen, and all-round humble guy.
P.S. I love cats!
Tika Malla
First year biochemist with budding enthusiasm in Synthetic Biology and hence a member of UCL iGEM 2015. Greatly inspired by Richard P. Feynman’s quote “ What I cannot create, I cannot understand” and iGEM is helping me do the same in the lab this summer ; create and understand and vice versa. In my spare time I binge watch series and if I decide to make my spare time productive, I go hiking or pick a book to read. Also I love exploring new places and learning new languages or at least attempting to.
