Start-Up Culture Preparation, continued
The three start-up cultures are removed from the shaking incubator. An Optical Density (OD) check was performed on each one.
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 3: 0.2
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 4, Colony 1: 0.38
Start-Up Culture from G-Block 4, Colony 2: 0.28
Procedure to Measure OD
1 mL of LB broth in cuvette used as blank
100 ul of sample, 900 ul of LB broth in cuvette
AD 600 reading multiplied by 10 to obtain OD measurement (Beer-Lambert's Law)
Next, we autoclaved 1 L LB, added 1 mL of Ampicillin. The OD measurement from start-up culture tube labelled G-Block 4, Colony 1, was 0.38, the highest and most optimal out of the three. The contents of this tube were added to the 1 L of LB and 1 mL of ampicillin. The contents were put in a shaking incubator for 3 hours and 45 minutes. Another OD check was completed, this time reported to be 0.5. Next 5 mL of IPTG was added to further initiate growth and the contents were left to incubate overnight.
