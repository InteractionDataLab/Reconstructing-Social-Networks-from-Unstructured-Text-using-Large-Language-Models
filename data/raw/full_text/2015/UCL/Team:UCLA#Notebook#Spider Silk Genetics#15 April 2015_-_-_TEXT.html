1 MaSp2 Polymerase Chain Assembly
Set up two 50 uL PCR reactions each for 2BC and 2CA using the same guidelines on 4/13/2015 with the following modifications:
∙ Annealing Temp: 64 C
∙ 25 cycles instead of 20
2 Gel Purification of MaSp2 Monomers
∙ Visualized with 1.5% agarose gel. Similar result to yesterday’s gel.
∙ Used gel purification kit (zymo) to extract DNA from 2AB, 2BC, and 2CA.
