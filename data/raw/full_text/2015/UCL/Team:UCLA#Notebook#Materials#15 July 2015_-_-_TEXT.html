Preparing fibers for Instron testing
cut 25mm x 25mm cardstock squares
in the squares, cut a 10mm long hole to create a frame
Lay down some black tape on the inside of a PDMS mold (which happens to be 25mm x 25mm as well)
place the frame on top of the PDMS mold
place epoxy glue on the sides of the frame
Lay down a single fiber across the frame
place another layer of cardstock on the epoxy glue to cover the fiber.
allow epoxy to cure for at least 24 hours
Today, we ran Instron tests on natural b.mori silk fibers.
some challenges in the Instron testing:
it's near impossible to get the fibers to be perfectly straight in the Instron
very difficult to lay down the fiber so that it is flat on the tab
when cutting the tab margins, sometimes the fiber is shifted at an angle in the Instron
sometimes when laying down the fiber, it is not taut, and so you are actually tabbing a longer length of fiber than the length of the window.
tabbed some of yesterday's fibers for Instron testing.
labeled Tam 1, Tam 2, ... Tam 5.
