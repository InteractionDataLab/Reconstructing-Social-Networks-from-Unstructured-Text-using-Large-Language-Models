Stretcher is up and running
gave it a few test runs
Some problems with it:
the godet has too much friction/attraction to the thread. As a result, the thread is unable to pass from the 1st godet to the 2nd. The 1st godet drags the thread along with it, so I am unable to advance it to the 2nd.
it is extremely difficult to wind the thread around the 1st godet and then guide it to the 2nd by hand.
it is extremely difficult to unwind the thread after removing it from the ethanol. It comes out as a soggy, clumped mess.
It might be best to have the collection spool out in dry air
Some observations
It is very easy to catch the fiber onto the 1st godet and just let it wind around it.
We may just switch to a 1-godet design, where 1 godet both stretches AND captures the thread
However, here there is the problem of recollecting the thread after it has been spooled and withdrawn from the ethanol.
A godet speed of 150 seems to be close to the speed at which the thread is coming out of the tubing.
to reduce friction of the godet, we tried polishing them with acetone (they are made of ABS plastic, and acetone dissolves it).
Sri gave a great suggestion:
Wind the thread around the 1st godet.
Once all of the thread has been extruded, reverse the 1st godet, and feed the thread to the 2nd godet.
update:I tried this, it didn't work. The godet still tugged the thead back, even when it was running in reverse. This doesn't make sense to me, but it did it.
I think I got it!
A trick to reduce the friction of the godet is to capture some thread on the godet
essentially, cover the godet with the thread
and then wrap the thread around 1st godet and feed to 2nd godet
