Preparation of Lots of Tamura, continued
The three start-up cultures are removed from the shaking incubator and an OD check is performed using 1 mL of LB as a blank, and 100 ul of start-up culture and 900 ul of LB as OD test sample. The start-up culture with the most optimal OD measurement, 0.38, is added to 1 L of autoclaved LB with 1 mL of Ampicillin. The contents are in a large Erlenmeyer flask and put in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees Celsius for 4 hours. The flask is removed, 5 mL of IPTG solution is added to kickstart growth, and the flask is put back in shaking incubator and let to incubate overnight, once again at 37 degrees Celsius.
