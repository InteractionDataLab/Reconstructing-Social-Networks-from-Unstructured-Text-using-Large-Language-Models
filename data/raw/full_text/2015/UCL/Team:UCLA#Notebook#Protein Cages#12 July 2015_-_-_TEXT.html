Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Starter culture will be done today.
Procedures:
10mL of LB was added to a culture tube.  For a final concentration of 100ug/mL of carbenicillin, 10uL of 100mg/mL was added to the 10mL of LB.  Using a sterile pipette tip, and pipette, a single colony was streaked and the entire tip was ejected into the culture tube.  The tube was then incubated at 37C at 5:50PM.  In addition, another 1L of LB was made and autoclaved for 30 minutes.
