Summary
Background
The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said         that there was "in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every         forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated         in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and         one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars were, last         year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the         city, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to         destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help         save them.'"
In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits         as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and         large places of the state.

But few of the human race die of old age. Besides the thousand and one         diseases flesh is heir to, and the disease which Mrs. O'Flannagan said her         husband died of, viz., "Of a Saturday 'tis that poor Mike died," very many         die of disappointment. More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, "It is the         fretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear."
"Choked with passion" is no chimera; for passion often kills the         unfortunate possessor of an irritable temper, sometimes suddenly. Care and         over-anxiety sweep away thousands annually.
Let us see how long a man should live. The horse lives twenty-five years;         the ox fifteen or twenty; the lion about twenty; the dog ten or twelve;         the rabbit eight; the guinea-pig six or seven years. These numbers all         bear a similar proportion to the time the animal takes to grow to its full         size. But man, of all animals, is the one that seldom comes up to his         average. He ought to live a hundred years, according to this physiological         law, for five times twenty are one hundred; but instead of that, he         scarcely reaches, on the average, four times his growing period; the cat         six times; and the rabbit even eight times the standard of measurement.         The reason is obvious. Man is not only the most irregular and the most         intemperate, but the most laborious and hard-worked of all animals. He is         also the most irritable of all animals; and there is reason to believe,         though we cannot tell what an animal secretly feels, that, more than any         other animal, man cherishes wrath to keep it warm, and consumes himself         with the fire of his secret reflections.
"Age dims the lustre of the eye, and pales the roses on beauty's cheek;         while crows' feet, and furrows, and wrinkles, and lost teeth, and gray hairs, and bald head, and tottering limbs, and limping, most sadly mar the         human form divine. But dim as the eye is, pallid and sunken as may be the         face of beauty, and frail and feeble that once strong, erect, and manly         body, the immortal soul, just fledging its wings for its home in heaven,         may look out through those faded windows as beautiful as the dewdrop of         summer's morning, as melting as the tears that glisten in affection's eye,         by growing kindly, by cultivating sympathy with all human kind, by         cherishing forbearance towards the follies and foibles of our race, and         feeding, day by day, on that love to God and man which lifts us from the         brute, and makes us akin to angels."

The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.
The Saxons long and long ago got up the delightful occasion. Amongst the         ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and         sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at         weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the         nobility sometimes for a month--"monath." The "hunig monath" was thus         established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the         honeymoon.
Alaric, about the fifth century king of the Saxons and Western Goths, is         said to have actually died on his wedding night from drinking too freely         of the honeyed beverage,--at least he died before morning,--and it         certainly would seem to be a charitable inference to draw, since he         partook very deeply of the "festive drink." It was certainly a sweet         oblivion, "yet it should be a warning to posterity, as showing that even         bridegrooms may make too merry."
Dr. Blanchet recently read a paper before the Academy of Science, Paris,         relative to some cases of "long sleep," or lethargic slumber. One of them         related to a lady twenty years of age, who took a sleeping fit during her         _honeymoon_, which lasted fifty days.
"During this long period a false front tooth had to be taken out in order         to introduce milk and broth into her mouth. This was her only food; she         remained motionless, insensible, and all her muscles were in a state of         contraction. Her pulse was low, her breathing scarcely perceptible; there         was no evacuation, no leanness; her complexion was florid and healthy.         The other cases were exactly similar. Dr. Blanchet is of opinion that in         such cases no stimulants or forced motion ought to be employed.
"The report did not say whether the husband was pleased or not with her         long silence."
There is too much talk in the world about woman's "_jaw_." As for me, give         me the woman who can _talk_; the faster and more sense the better.

Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly         fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of         witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a         case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to         witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to         dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one of the faculty.
The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant         experience of his skill. The husband of the "maid" accused her of         flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the         ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The         wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,         keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.
"Send her to me," said the czar.
The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were         sound, and never ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she         did when the physician was called; therefore, in spite of her cries and         remonstrances, the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his         knees, when the czar drew out his instruments and instantly extracted the         tooth designated by the husband, disregarding the cries of the unfortunate         victim.
In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the         jealous husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant         wife, whereupon the instruments were again brought into requisition; and         this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a         sound and valuable tooth.

Summary
From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon,"         by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which         the author terms "Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:"--
"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and         much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,         the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,         in what was then a fashionable up-town street.
"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my         few books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and         then left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on         the table, to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.
"These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I         considered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted         their most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted         harnesses for my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams,         and my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and         nurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.
"In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my         rose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and         occasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel,         with her customary account of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me         heart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in         their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden.         (What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)
"And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of         character. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a         lovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish         merchant down town.
"This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I         was summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr.         Mackerel, of the firm of 'Mackerel, Haddock & Dun.'
"One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a         furious ring at the front door made me feel particularly amiable! A         servant announced the sudden and alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with         the assurance that as the family physician was out of town, Mrs. M. would         be obliged if I would immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found         myself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess         it--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.
"Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful         fool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old         Mackerel. Her charms would have procured her a husband of at least a         tolerable exterior. His physiognomy presented a remarkable resemblance to         his namesake. Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the         aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must         have been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as         Mrs. Mackerel's.
"I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has         since taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a         domestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the         true cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet         he felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.
"Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the         'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of         health previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack         and speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to         the dancing, heated room, and the supper.
"I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges,         chicken-salad, oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one         moment almost concluded to despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac;         but--I prudently avoided it. Aside from the improbability of excess of         appetite through the portal of such a mouth, the lovely color of the         cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to Mr. Mackerel's         solution of the cause.
"I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as         the thought of an angel's breast!
"I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that         bosom so gently swelling in repose?'
"Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's         condition received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions         put to me on the cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably         befogged him with opinions, and lulled his suspicions to rest, by the         apparent innocent answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the         conclusion most desirable to him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction         quite necessary in some nervous cases....
"So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that         he very courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering         a servant to show me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on the         patient again in the morning.
"After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about         me heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had         the extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation         with her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of         a 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the         eminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of         influence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her         sharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her         'quite an agreeable person.'
"Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had         evidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband         on the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight         of my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause         for her nervousness.
"One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover,         as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course,         acquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked.         I took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed         for Saratoga.
"The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The         day following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to         inquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape         having fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of         soothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and         holding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such         consolation as her trying position required!"
Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New         York. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured,         to cover the occupation of the parties. The doctor still lives, in the         enjoyment of a lucrative and respectable practice, and the love and         confidence of his numerous friends and patrons.
Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they         would but take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the         various circumstances which were mainly instrumental in getting them into         a respectable practice.
