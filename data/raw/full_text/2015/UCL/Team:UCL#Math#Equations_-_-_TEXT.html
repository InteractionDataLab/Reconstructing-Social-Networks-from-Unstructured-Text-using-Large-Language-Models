Stochastic Differential Equations
The equations we would like to solve are in the form
$$dX=\mu(t, X(t))dt+\sigma(t,X(t))dB(t)$$
This is for two given functions $a$ and $b$. Also where $B(t)$ is a Brownian motion.         $X$ is a solution to the above equation, given that X is a function or path, if it satisfies the following
$$X(T)=\int_0^T \mu(t,X(t))dt + \int_0^T \sigma(t,X(t))dB(t)$$
