Colony PCR of 7/12 Transformation
The transformation was successful for the 3:1 ligated products plates. I picked 3 colonies off the plate and suspended each in 100uL of ddH2O.

Visualization
I ran each of the sample on a 1% agarose gel against a 1kB ladder for 20 minutes. Expected band sizes: ~1000bp
Samples 1 and 3 had bright bands at the appropriate base pair length.

Inoculation
The remaining 99uL of samples 1 and 3 were inoculated with 5mL LB broth and 5uL 1000X kanamycin, incubated at 37C.
Testing competency of BL21 cells from 7/12
Used puc 19 vector at 50 picograms/ul to test transformation efficiency.
Added 2 ul of puc 19 to 50 ul of competent BL21 cells
Used this NEB protocol to transform with our BL21 cells.
Plated 10% of the cells on a warm amp plate and put plate in at 4 pm 7/13
