ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Silk fibers from yesterday were soaked overnight in their respective coagulation baths (isopropanol and ethanol)
Today, we placed the fibers in ddH2O to rinse them
Took some samples onto microscope slides in order to image
Left the rest of the fibers on weigh boats to dry off
The silk is incredibly difficult to handle. We absolutely need a mechanical draw in order to handle the fibers better in the future!
Fibers were extremely brittle.
Overview of these fibers
15% w/v silk dope
Spun into 70% v/v ethanol or isopropanol
Used a 1 mL syringe attached to 0.0005 inch inner diameter PEEK tubing
extruded at a nominal rate of 6 uL/min on the syringe pump
After spinning, left in coagulation bath overnight
Then bathed in water
Then taken out and left to dry
Overall, it seems so far that ethanol is better than isopropanol as a coagulation bath. However, until we incorporate a mechanical post-spin draw, we can't say for sure.
Images of Silk spun into isopropanol
4x magnification
10x magnification
20x magnification
40x magnification
Those appear to be cracks
20x magnification
Notice the split: we were probably imaging multiple fibers, instead of one. This shows how difficult it is to handle individual fibers while they're still wet!
40x magnification
This is the edge of the fiber where we broke it.

Notice how compared to the isopropanol spun fiber, the morphology is much more smooth and uniform for the ethanol fiber. I wonder how these would look under electron microscopy?
Meeting with Julian regarding hydrogels
making hybrid hydrogels with native bombyx mori silk + Tamura, ABD, etc.
yields of the recombinant protein
a few mg yield
in a buffer
fairly low concentration
we'll likely vortex the solution to gelate
Next week, we'll likely be making negative controls
have just a silk hydrogel
measure to see if any protein leaches out from the gel on its own
we would need to account for this
make silk + albumin hydrogel
measure how much albumin leaches out
make silk hydrogel, put albumin solution on top
measure how much albumin goes in/ leaches out without the albumin binding domain
Experimental gels
make a hydrogel with albumin-binding-domain-silk in it
pipette a solution of albumin over the top, let it soak for a while into hydrogel. give it time to bind
remove albumin solution
pipette some saltwater/buffer solution on top
at various time points, take aliquots and assay to see how much protein leached out
