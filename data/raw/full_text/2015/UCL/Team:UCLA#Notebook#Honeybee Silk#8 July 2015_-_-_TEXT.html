Inoculation of 5/19 Transformation
Recent experiments have proven that the pET24a miniprepped sample was not correct. Today I will repick colonies and grow them up for miniprepping.
I picked two colonies from the 1:1 kanamycin plate and suspended them in 100uL ddH2O. Each sample was incubated at 37C with 5mL LB broth and 5uL 1000X kanamycin.
PCR of Honeybee G-block and Purification
The concentration obtained after digestion and purification was too low (20.12ng/uL), today I will be redoing the PCR, digestion, and purification to obtain a higher yield.

The sample was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel with 10uL 6X loading dye against a 1kB ladder. Expected band size: ~1000bp
