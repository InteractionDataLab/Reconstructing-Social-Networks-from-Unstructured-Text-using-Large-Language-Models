8/5
Analyzing dry film test.
Weight of 100 ul SDS solution after drying = 3.3mg
5/26 Silk = 3.5 mg (subtracting the 3.3 mg of SDS = 0.2 mg
7/29 silk = 20.5 mg or 17.2 mg after controlling for SDS.
This corresponds to 0.2 weight by volume percent for the 5/26 Silk and 4 mg total for the 250 ml culture.
Corresponds to a 17.2 w/v% for the 7/29 silk and 129 mg total for the 100 ml culture
Once again, keep in mind that this is not necessarily all honeybee silk, and could be cellular debris and other contaminating proteins.
Starting 300ml Culture of Honeybee Silk
300 ml LB and 300 ul KAN, with one colony.
Inoculated at noon
At 4PM the OD was 0.06
At 5:40 PM the OD was 0.56
At that point added 150 ul of 1M IPTG (0.5mM)
Will incubate overnight.
After overnight incubation, the OD was 2.42
