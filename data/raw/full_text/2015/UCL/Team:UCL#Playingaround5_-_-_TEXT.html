The number of microorganisms in human gut is higher than the number of human cells in our body. Their metabolic activity equals that of liver and plays crucial role in many key processes such as digestion, drug metabolism, or functioning of the immune system...
Studies in mice have shown that the gut microbiome is also capable of  influencing the chemistry of our brain, thus regulating our behaviour , anxiety , mood , cognition and pain ...
Being inspired by this emerging research area, UCL
2015 team wants to explore the modulation of the gut bacteria as a strategy for developing novel treatments for mental health disorders. Ultimately, our goal is to harness synthetic biology to make people happy!

Mind the Gut: Abstract
The gut–brain axis refers to the biochemical signalling taking place between the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system, often involving intestinal microbiota, which have been shown to play an important role in healthy brain function. The current research suggests that gut microbes secrete neuroactive compounds – including neurotransmitters – that interact with the brain via two main mechanisms: the vagus nerve, connecting brain and digestive tract, and the immune system, which maintains its own means of communication with the brain.
In line with the ongoing research, UCL iGEM 2015 aims to develop synthetic probiotic strains that mimic the neuromodulatory strategies identified in gut microbes, with a focus on regulation of tryptophan pathway and signalling via serotonin. Additionally, in order to incorporate our neuromodulators into precise and safe therapeutic devices,  we are developing a set of sensors capable of detecting mood-related physiological changes in the gut environment.
Available small molecule treatments are associated with both stigma and side effects. We believe that, besides aiding in better understanding of the communication between the gut microbiome and nervous system, our work will also lay a foundation for novel user-friendly treatments targeting a range of mental health disorders.
