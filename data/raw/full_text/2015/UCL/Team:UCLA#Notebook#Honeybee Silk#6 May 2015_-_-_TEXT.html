5/6 Miniprep and Making Glycerol Stocks of Silk and promoter + silk constructs
These two constructs are BBa_K1763001 and BBa_K1763000
The overnight cultures were taken out of the incubator.  They looked nice and opaque.
500 ul of the 6 inoculated cultures were used to make 6 different glycerol stocks.
These were placed in the Honeybee Glycerol Stocks box in the -80 in Sriâ€™s lab,  It is on the second row of boxes, second column.
