5/27 Messing Around with Silk Purification Products
Messed around with the supernatants from the wash step that contained that viscous liquid
Adding 1 ul of DNAse for 15 minutes, and rotating, followed by 15 min centrifugation at 10000 g seemed to get rid of the viscous substance.
This result substantiates that it was most likely chromosomal DNA. Next time I will add DNAse while doing the purification protocol.
As noted in yesterday's entry, the inclusion body solubilized in 3% SDS and stored in the cold room seemed to gel up overnight.
Ill put in just straight 3% SDS in a tube in the cold room as a negative control.
