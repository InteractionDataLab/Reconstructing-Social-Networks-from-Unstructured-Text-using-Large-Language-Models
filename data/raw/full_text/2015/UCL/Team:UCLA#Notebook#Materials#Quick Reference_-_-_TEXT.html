Dialysis
For a 10 mL sample, 10 mm of dialysis tubing is too long
However, having that several mm of clearance at the top to seal with the clips is good.
Dialysis changes for LiBr silk: 1hr, 4hr, "that evening," morning, night, morning
Wetspinning
15% w/v aqueous silk extruding at rate of 10uL/min, BD plastic 1mL syringe, into 90% v/v Isopropanol bath, comes out at a rate of 7.3846 mm/s
