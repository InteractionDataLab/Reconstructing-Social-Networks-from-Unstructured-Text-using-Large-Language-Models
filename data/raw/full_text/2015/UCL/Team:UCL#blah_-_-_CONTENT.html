Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said
								that there was &quot;in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every
								forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated
								in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and
								one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand </P></DIV><DIV id="column2"><P> dollars were, last
								year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the
								city, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to
								destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help
								save them.'&quot;</P><P>In New London, report says, the young men are falling into drinking habits
								as never before. So in New Haven, Bridgeport, and the other cities and
								large places of the state.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="bb-item" id="item2"><DIV class="content"><DIV class="scroller"><H2>Our constructs</H2><P>But few of the human race die of old age. Besides the thousand and one
								diseases flesh is heir to, and the disease which Mrs. O'Flannagan said her
								husband died of, viz., &quot;Of a Saturday 'tis that poor Mike died,&quot; very many
								die of disappointment. More _fret_ out. Mr. Beecher said, &quot;It is the
								fretting that wears out the machinery; friction, not the real wear.&quot;</P><P>&quot;Choked with passion&quot; is no chimera; for passion often kills the
								unfortunate possessor of an irritable temper, sometimes suddenly. Care and
								over-anxiety sweep away thousands annually.</P><P>Let us see how long a man should live. The horse lives twenty-five years;
								the ox fifteen or twenty; the lion about twenty; the dog ten or twelve;
								the rabbit eight; the guinea-pig six or seven years. These numbers all
								bear a similar proportion to the time the animal takes to grow to its full
								size. But man, of all animals, is the one that seldom comes up to his
								average. He ought to live a hundred years, according to this physiological
								law, for five times twenty are one hundred; but instead of that, he
								scarcely reaches, on the average, four times his growing period; the cat
								six times; and the rabbit even eight times the standard of measurement.
								The reason is obvious. Man is not only the most irregular and the most
								intemperate, but the most laborious and hard-worked of all animals. He is
								also the most irritable of all animals; and there is reason to believe,
								though we cannot tell what an animal secretly feels, that, more than any
								other animal, man cherishes wrath to keep it warm, and consumes himself
								with the fire of his secret reflections.</P><P>&quot;Age dims the lustre of the eye, and pales the roses on beauty's cheek;
								while crows' feet, and furrows, and wrinkles, and lost teeth, and gray
								hairs, and bald head, and tottering limbs, and limping, most sadly mar the
								human form divine. But dim as the eye is, pallid and sunken as may be the
								face of beauty, and frail and feeble that once strong, erect, and manly
								body, the immortal soul, just fledging its wings for its home in heaven,
								may look out through those faded windows as beautiful as the dewdrop of
								summer's morning, as melting as the tears that glisten in affection's eye,
								by growing kindly, by cultivating sympathy with all human kind, by
								cherishing forbearance towards the follies and foibles of our race, and
								feeding, day by day, on that love to God and man which lifts us from the
								brute, and makes us akin to angels.&quot;</P><P><EM>From <A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41595" target="_blank">&quot;The Funny Side of Physic&quot;</A> by A. D.

Amongst the
								ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and
								sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at
								weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the
								nobility sometimes for a month--&quot;monath.&quot; The &quot;hunig monath&quot; was thus
								established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the
								honeymoon.</P><P>Alaric, about the fifth century king of the Saxons and Western Goths, is
								said to have actually died on his wedding night from drinking too freely
								of the honeyed beverage,--at least he died before morning,--and it
								certainly would seem to be a charitable inference to draw, since he
								partook very deeply of the &quot;festive drink.&quot; It was certainly a sweet
								oblivion, &quot;yet it should be a warning to posterity, as showing that even
								bridegrooms may make too merry.&quot;</P><P>Dr. Blanchet recently read a paper before the Academy of Science, Paris,
								relative to some cases of &quot;long sleep,&quot; or lethargic slumber. One of them
								related to a lady twenty years of age, who took a sleeping fit during her
								_honeymoon_, which lasted fifty days.</P><P>&quot;During this long period a false front tooth had to be taken out in order
								to introduce milk and broth into her mouth. This was her only food; she
								remained motionless, insensible, and all her muscles were in a state of
								contraction. Her pulse was low, her breathing scarcely perceptible; there
								was no evacuation, no leanness; her complexion was florid and healthy.
								The other cases were exactly similar. Dr. Blanchet is of opinion that in
								such cases no stimulants or forced motion ought to be employed.</P><P>&quot;The report did not say whether the husband was pleased or not with her
								long silence.&quot;</P><P>There is too much talk in the world about woman's &quot;_jaw_.&quot; As for me, give
								me the woman who can _talk_; the faster and more sense the better.</P><P><EM>From <A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41595" target="_blank">&quot;The Funny Side of Physic&quot;</A> by A.

								fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
								witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
								case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
								witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
								dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
								of the faculty.</P><P>The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant
								experience of his skill. The husband of the &quot;maid&quot; accused her of
								flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the
								ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The
								wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,
								keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.</P><P>&quot;Send her to me,&quot; said the czar.</P><P>The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were
								sound, and never ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she
								did when the physician was called; therefore, in spite of her cries and
								remonstrances, the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his
								knees, when the czar drew out his instruments and instantly extracted the
								tooth designated by the husband, disregarding the cries of the unfortunate
								victim.</P><P>In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the
								jealous husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant
								wife, whereupon the instruments were again brought into requisition; and
								this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a
								sound and valuable tooth.</P><P><EM>From <A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41595" target="_blank">&quot;The Funny Side of Physic&quot;</A> by A. D.

								by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which
								the author terms &quot;Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:&quot;--</P><P>&quot;In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and
								much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,
								the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,
								in what was then a fashionable up-town street.</P><P>&quot;I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my
								few books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and
								then left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on
								the table, to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.</P><P>&quot;These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I
								considered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted
								their most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted
								harnesses for my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams,
								and my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and
								nurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.</P><P>&quot;In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my
								rose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and
								occasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel,
								with her customary account of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me
								heart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in
								their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden.
								(What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)</P><P>&quot;And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of
								character. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a
								lovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish
								merchant down town.</P><P>&quot;This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I
								was summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr.
								Mackerel, of the firm of 'Mackerel, Haddock &amp; Dun.'</P><P>&quot;One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a
								furious ring at the front door made me feel particularly amiable! A
								servant announced the sudden and alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with
								the assurance that as the family physician was out of town, Mrs. M. would
								be obliged if I would immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found
								myself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess
								it--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.</P><P>&quot;Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful
								fool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old
								Mackerel. Her charms would have procured her a husband of at least a
								tolerable exterior. His physiognomy presented a remarkable resemblance to
								his namesake. Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the
								aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must
								have been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as
								Mrs. Mackerel's.</P><P>&quot;I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has
								since taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a
								domestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the
								true cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet
								he felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.</P><P>&quot;Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the
								'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of
								health previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack
								and speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to
								the dancing, heated room, and the supper.</P><P>&quot;I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges,
								chicken-salad, oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one
								moment almost concluded to despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac;
								but--I prudently avoided it. Aside from the improbability of excess of
								appetite through the portal of such a mouth, the lovely color of the
								cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to Mr. Mackerel's
								solution of the cause.</P><P>&quot;I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as
								the thought of an angel's breast!

								</P><P>&quot;I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that
								bosom so gently swelling in repose?'</P><P>&quot;Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's
								condition received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions
								put to me on the cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably
								befogged him with opinions, and lulled his suspicions to rest, by the
								apparent innocent answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the
								conclusion most desirable to him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction
								quite necessary in some nervous cases....</P><P>&quot;So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that
								he very courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering
								a servant to show me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on the
								patient again in the morning.</P><P>&quot;After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about
								me heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had
								the extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation
								with her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of
								a 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the
								eminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of
								influence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her
								sharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her
								'quite an agreeable person.'</P><P>&quot;Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had
								evidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband
								on the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight
								of my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause
								for her nervousness.</P><P>&quot;One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover,
								as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course,
								acquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked.
								I took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed
								for Saratoga.</P><P>&quot;The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The
								day following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to
								inquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape
								having fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of
								soothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and
								holding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such
								consolation as her trying position required!&quot;</P><P>Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New
								York. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured,
								to cover the occupation of the parties. The doctor still lives, in the
								enjoyment of a lucrative and respectable practice, and the love and
								confidence of his numerous friends and patrons.</P><P>Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they
								would but take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the
								various circumstances which were mainly instrumental in getting them into
								a respectable practice.</P><P><EM>From <A href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41595" target="_blank">&quot;The Funny Side of Physic&quot;</A> by A. D.
