Sequencing Results for M2-9(T7)
All three samples have correct sequencing based on VF and VR.
Choose sample 2 as the one to give to the Protein Expression team.
Miniprep and Sequencing
Miniprep (Zymo) for M1-AB,BC,CA and M2-12(1C3).
Three samples each.
All samples were typical miniprep quality DNA.
Concentration was approx. 500 ng/uL
A 260/280 was between 1.82 and 1.89 for all samples.
ICA for M2-15
Olivia performed ICA for M2-15.
Used smaller wash volumes, and 4 minute ligation time.
Eluted in 0.01% Tween-20, but not amplified up.
