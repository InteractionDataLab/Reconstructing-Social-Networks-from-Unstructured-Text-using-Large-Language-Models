1. VF/R Amplification of MaSp Plasmid
Based on yesterday's results with amplifying 2CA using the VF/R primer pair, we decided to scale up to obtain enough plasmid to perform digestion tests.
We used the following protocol, and set up 2x 50 uL for amplification of 2CA.

2CA was diluted from 219 ng/uL 1:1000 in ddH2O to 219 pg/uL.
2. Results
We visualized the results on 2% TAE agarose gel using 2 uL NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 MaSp2 2CA amplified using VF/R primers. The expected VF/R product is 443 bp. The expected P/E product is 170 bp.
The presence of a smear under 50 bp may indicate incomplete PCR and leftover primers. We will try 20 cycles in the future to see if better amplification can be achieved.
We excised the bands at ~450 bp for gel extraction tomorrow.
