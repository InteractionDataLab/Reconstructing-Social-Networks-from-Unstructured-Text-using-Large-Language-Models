Performed a double dialysis
100g of PEG (10k MW) in 900 mL of water
loaded 10 mL of 3.7% w/v silk into dialysis cassette
note: when loading the silk, I accidentally applied too much shear stress -- I tried to inject while the needle still wasn't fully inside the cassette. When the needle did penetrate, the silk solution then bursted out. I didn't observe any particulates in the cassette, but it is possible that some small volume of the silk already sheared into beta sheets.
Dialysis START: 4:30 PM, July 8.
