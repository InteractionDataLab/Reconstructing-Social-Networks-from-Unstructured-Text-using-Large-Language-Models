Transformation of Device Ligations using chemically competent BL21(DE3) Mix n' Go E. coli cells
Each ligation was was transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) Mix n' Go E. coli cells using the Mix n' Go protocol.  Megan Satyadi prepared the cell lines using the Mix n. Go Buffer and Transformation Kit.
Transformation followed this protocol:
Step
Temperature (degrees Celsius)
Time
Pre-warm 3 LB Agar + Chloramphenicol (34 ug/uL) plates per ligation. Prewarm 200 uL of SOC media per ligation product.
37
1 hour
Thaw 1 50uL of cells per ligation from -80 degree freezer and the ligated products from -20 degree freezer.
On ice (0)
10 minutes
Add 2uL of ligation product per aliquot of cells.  Briefly flick to mix DNA into cells.
On ice
Let mixture incubate.
On ice
5 minutes
Transfer cell-DNA mixture to pre-warmed SOC media.  Invert rescued media 3-4 times to mix.
RT
(For chloramphenicol) Outgrow the cell-DNA mixture in SOC shaking at 650 RPM.
37 degrees
1 hour
Spin the cell pellets down at 6000 RPM.  Discard the old media.
4
5 minutes
Resuspend the cell pellets in 100 uL of fresh SOC media.  Gently pipet to mix.
RT
Plate 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100 dilutions of each cell mixture on each of the three prewired plates per transformation.
RT
Use sterile glass beads to spread cells in a figure 8 motion.  Discard beads carefully after spread.
RT
Let mixture dry on agar, then invert and incubate overnight.
37
16-22 hours.
Observe plates for colony growth.  Image and place in the freezer for storage with parafilm.
