Escherichia spp., and Bacillus spp. have been reported to produce norepinephrine;
Streptococcus spp., Escherichia spp. and Enterococcus spp. have been reported to

According to the authors, tryptophan exhibits negligible fluorescence above 300 nm, and using excitation wavelength of 300 nm results in 5-hydroxytryptophan being almost exclusively excited. The emission is measured at 330 nm. As the assay was reported to be suitable for unpurified samples, we have performed fluorescence measurements using crude cell lysates.

She also mentioned how drugs gradually became ineffective overtime, and the dosage needs to be constantly increased, which is a major financial burden. Well, the administration of Pregnenolone and its derivates prevents the development of tolerance, and augments recovery from benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety and hyperactivity in mice. Benzodiazepines, such as Valium, are one of the most popular antidepressant/anti-anxiety drugs in the world! Basically, this removes the need to constantly increase the dosage, and gets rid of many side effects and withdrawal symptoms, associated with treatments that act on the GABA receptor. Hence, combining it, pregnenolone, with our biobricks creates a complete system, which not only treat mental illness but also reduce side effects of treatment! Hence we have expanded on our silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how we have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.

·      </P><P><B>   Depression/Anxiety:</B></P><P>Neurosteroids derived from Pregnenolone modulate several neurotransmitter systems such as gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and acetylcholine receptors. As physiologic consequences, they are involved in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory processes, aggression and epilepsy, and they modulate the responses to stress, anxiety and depression. There is evidence for a common mechanism of action between neurosteroids and sigma1-receptor ligands and focus on the potential therapeutic interests of such interaction in the physiopathology of learning and memory impairments, stress, depression and neuroprotection.

·     <P><B>   Schizophrenia Treatment:</B></P><P>Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that pregnenolone may be a promising novel therapeutic candidate in schizophrenia. Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid with pleiotropic actions in rodents that include the enhancement of learning and memory, neuritic outgrowth, and myelination. Further, pregnenolone administration results in elevations in downstream neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, a molecule with neuroprotective effects that also increases neurogenesis, decreases apoptosis and inflammation, modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and markedly increases GABA(A) receptor responses. In addition, pregnenolone administration elevates pregnenolone sulfate, a neurosteroid that positively modulates NMDA receptors. There are thus multiple mechanistic possibilities for pregnenolone as a potential therapeutic agent in schizophrenia, including the amelioration of NMDA receptor hypofunction (via metabolism to pregnenolone sulfate) and the mitigation of GABA dysregulation (via metabolism to allopregnanolone).

· </H4><H3>Results</H3><P>We ran an HPLC assay for the pregnenelone biobrick to characterise its function.
Pregenolone was seen as a clear peak at around 11mins. 

A standard curve was plotted based on the peaks. The standard curve was then used to calculate the concentration of pregnenolone produced by each sample:

<UL><LI>Sample with no cholesterol- 0mg/ml</LI><LI>Sample with cholesterol in 2-hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin- 0.0007mg/ml</LI><LI>Sample with cholesterol in DMSO- 0.007mg/ml</LI></UL><B>Therefore, we got a maximum pregnenolone production of 0.007 mg/ml within 4 hours of substrate addition!</B></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
