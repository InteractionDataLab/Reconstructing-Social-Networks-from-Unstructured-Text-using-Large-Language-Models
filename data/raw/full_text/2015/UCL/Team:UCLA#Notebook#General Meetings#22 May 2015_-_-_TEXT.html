Week 8 General Meeting
Committee Updates
Administrative
Stuff goes here
External Affairs
Start coordinating a SoCal iGEM Meetup
Laverne, CalTech, UCSD, SDA Encanitas, TPCC San Diego, CCA San Diego (maybe invite norcal teams too)
Financial
Donut fundraiser profits: ~$90ish range
David's holding on to the cash
Infomedia
T-shirts are here!
$9 per student-- cash or venmo to Anuved (check Slack for phone number)
SPARK filming next week
Lab Management
We have SOP forms prepared and ready to turn in to Seidlits, but she has lately been unavailable
Have olivia drop off under Seidlit's door, or have Dino sign it
Social
Summer kickoff/Goodbye seniors dinner next Friday after GM
Project Updates/Discussion
Spider Silk Genetics
Working on optimizing PCR amplification of MaSp plasmids
We tested post-elution primers and VF/R primers for amplification.
VF/R seem to work fine, will be doing the ligation test and BsaI digestion using PCR product next week
We put the NotI concatemer scheme on hold until we show that PCR amplification works (or doesn’t work)
When can we order initiator, terminator, capping oligos.
Check out wiki notebook for more
Protein Expression
Julian: Finished Finished extraction of protein via lysis of cells with ABD domains, will start affinity chromatography next week to purify
Honeybee Silk
Megan: just redid the transformation with the pET24a expression vector, made glycerol stocks today, will be sequencing pet vector. Will be working on cloning the silk coding region in the pET vector.
Find out what sequencing primers to use for the pET vector
Materials
Tubing for double dialysis concentrating didn't work (how come?)
Will re-try with cassettes
Protein Cages
Revisited sites and compiled list of insertion sites (check our project notebook )
Tyler found a good spot to do a S → C mutation for conjugation (residues 9 and 11)
Email Yeates to check out wiki and provide feedback
Will begin designing gblocks and primers for site directed mutagenesis on Monday
