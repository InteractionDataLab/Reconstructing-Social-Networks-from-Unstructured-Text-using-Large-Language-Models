Miniprep of 7/15 Cultures
I miniprepped each of the five samples of Silk in Pet 24a using the Zymo Miniprep kit.

Colony PCR of 7/15 Transformation
Transformation Results
Each plate only had one colony present. Both were picked and suspended in 100uL Nuclease Free Water.
Colony PCR Reaction
using Q5, transformed E. coli, and the VF2 and VR primers in preparation for insertion into psb1c3
Two reactions, one for each of the colonies.

Gel Visualization
Both samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel against a 1kb ladder.
Expected band size: ~1600bp
Results:
Re-do of Silk-SpyCatcher Transformation
There were only one or two very small colonies from our transformation on 7/15.
We will colony PCR these two colonies
We will also re-try the ligation of the silk+SpyC into the psb1c3 backbone, this time cleaning up the ligation using zymo clean and concentrator and eluting into 10 ul of H20.
We can then re try the transformation.
