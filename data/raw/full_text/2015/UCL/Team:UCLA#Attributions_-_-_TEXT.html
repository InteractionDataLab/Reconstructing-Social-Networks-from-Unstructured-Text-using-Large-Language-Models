SilkyColi: Reprogramming the physical and functional properties of synthetic silks
Project Attributions
All members of the 2014 and 2015 UCLA iGEM teams were involved in project conceptualization, design, and execution.  For each group below, all members were involved in design, implementation, and submission/documentation of all validated BioBricks to the Registry. Additionally, thank you to the 2012 Utah State iGEM Team (ArachniColi) and the Randy Lewis Lab for laying the groundwork for the basic protocols we implemented toward processing our silk samples.
