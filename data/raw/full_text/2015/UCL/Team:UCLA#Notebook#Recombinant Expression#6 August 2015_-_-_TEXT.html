Suspension of Cells in Lysis Buffer
The L culture is removed from the shaking incubator and split into three 50mL centrifuge compatible containers. A fourth 50mL container is filled with water and used as a balance. The four containers are spun at 5000g fro 15 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are weighed. 1X Lysis Buffer is added in a 1 to 3 weight of cell pellet to volume of buffer ratio. The cell pellets are then stored at -20 degrees Celsius.
