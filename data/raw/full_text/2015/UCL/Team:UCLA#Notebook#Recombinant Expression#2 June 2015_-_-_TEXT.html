Tamura-GFP Hydrogel assay
Negative control - sfGFP without Tammy.
Experimental protein - Tamura
Assay for binding potential to doped silk solution.
Used stripping buffers to assay for agitation.   (detergents, alkalinity, ionic strength, pH).
Differing variables: Concentration of Dope, concentration of Tamura in hydrogel.
Temperature based gradient on hydrogel stability.
Assay for flourescence using microplane reading, distribution using fluorescence intensity (read into measuring this quality).
Characterization of Tamura -
SDS-PAGe gels, Western Blot to assay degradation.
CD, IR Spectrum, Fluorescence Intensity of purified protein and compare that with protein concentration - relative to that metric (ug).
Cry - EM for silk Tamura fibers - make sure that we don't mess with the fibers.
Gel meshes and pore size using EM.
Tamura-ABD Assays
Incubate in albumin containing solution for set time, measure the rate of release of albumin within the hydrogel.  Hydrogel with ABD-Tam, and ABD out.
CD, IR, before and post vortex of the solution.
Flourescence following washes of Tamura.
SElective binding to silk sequence regions.
Expectation of 100mg per 1L of cell culture.
1ng minimum per well for measureflourescnece.
Tamura - 00.5% of total silk, 2%,
0.5% is 25ug per well, 1% 50 ug per well 2% - 100 ug per well.
Net STEP: Make hydrogels in PBS tomorrow.
