UCL Engineering
The UCL faculty of Engineering Sciences is one of eleven at UCL, and contains eleven departments itself that each specialise in training and research across a wide variety of disciplines. Using new pioneering and engaging techniques, the engineering sciences department is looking to produce scientist and researchers who have an international outlook and can mix together knowledge from multiple fields to produce solutions to current world problems.
BBSRC
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council are one of seven councils in a group known as Research Councils UK (RCUK). BBSRC has a unique and central place in supporting the UK’s world-leading position in bioscience and aims to keep furthering scientific knowledge so as to start providing solutions to major challenges in the world today.
Wellcome Trust
Wellcome trust are a charitable foundation dedicated to improving health by supporting bright minds across science, the humanities and social science. They do this by focusing on giving researchers the resources and freedom they need to pursue their goals, whilst also working to maximise the application of research and help in the development of new products.
IDT
Integrated DNA Technologies are the world’s largest supplier of custom nucleic acids serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical development. Their mission is to enable discovery in biology and medicine by improving nucleic acid synthesis technology. IDT products are enabling scientist to test for new genetic diseases discover new drugs and develop new treatments models tailored to the specific needs of individual patients.
Biochemical Society
The Biochemical society exists to advance the molecular and cellular biosciences both as an academic discipline and to promote its impact on areas including biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. They try to achieve this through publications, journals, scientific meetings, educational activities, policy work, awards and grants to scientist and students. The Biochemical Society is one of five societies working at Charles Darwin House to try and strengthen biology as a subject by bringing the diverse skills, opinions and expertise of individual member societies together.
New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs produce and supply recombinant and native enzyme reagents for the life science research. ‘Created by scientists for scientists’, NEB is known for creating quality products and for helping to shape the bioscience research landscape by discovering, developing and supporting superior research reagents.
Genscript
GenScript is the world’s leading biology research service company, internationally recognised as a leading Contract Research Organisation (CRO) specialising in biological research and early phase drug discovery. GenScript is the most cited biology CRO in the world with more than 9,000 peer-reviewed journals citing Gnescript services and products.
Slack
A messaging app for teams, Slack allows for an easy way for teams to talk, share files and bring all your tools to one place. Used by companies worldwide from NASA to BuzzFeed Slack brings team communication to the twenty first century modernising and simplifying everything into a fast and intuitive format.
GATC Biotech
GATC Biotech is a German company specialist in DNA and RNA sequencing for academic and industrial partners worldwide. They are Europe’s leading service provider of DNA sequencing with more than 10,000 academics and industrial customers worldwide. GATC Biotech has sequenced more than 6 million samples, tens of thousands of bacterial, plant and other whole genomes as well as hundreds of whole human genomes.
SnapGene
SnapGene is a molecular biology software company born out of frustration after seeing how many avoidable mistakes were being made because biologist still didn't know the full properties of the DNA molecules they were using. For the creators of SnapGene the solution to this problem was simple. A molecular biology program that is easier to use then pen and paper, and which would automatically produce records of all the data produced so that it could be seen and used by all. This is how SnapGene was initially thought up and it has already won major funding from NIH and is being used all around the world by various labs and molecular biologists alike.
MathWorks
MathWorks is a company looking to improve the market by just sticking by the principle that the "right" answer does exist. They strive to measure themselves not just financially, but also by how well they are able to apply the principle of "Do the right thing" to everyday work. They plan to change the world and accelerate the pace of discovery in science and engineering by creating simple powerful software to allow researchers all over the world to make innovative solutions with a wide range of applications.
Synthace
Synthace is a company whose mission is to apply the best tools and working practices to hyperactive the bioeconomy by creating software tools that improve the productivity of bioengineering and developing robust, high yielding bioprocesses to make bio-based chemicals.
Promega
Promega Corporation is a manufacturer of enzymes and other products for biotechnology and molecular biology with a portfolio covering the fields of genomics, protein analysis and expression, cellular analysis, drug discovery and genetic identity.
Piktochart
Piktochart is an easy infographic design app. Their creators believe that simplicity is they key and that is why they decided to build a program that allows to create informative and engaging infographics in just three easy steps.
