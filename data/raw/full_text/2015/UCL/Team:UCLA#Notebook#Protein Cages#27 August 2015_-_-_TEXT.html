Intro: Nithin and I picked colonies and made starter cultures of the O.G. cage, and mutant 1, 2, 4, and 13.
Starter Cultures: Three colonies were chosen from each of the five plates. They were transferred via pipette tip to 10 mL LB with 10 uL chloramphenicol. The starter cultures will be incubated at 37C in a shaker overnight. Tomorrow, we will make glycerol stocks and sequence-verify all chosen colonies.
