Using the Seidlits lab's lyophilizer
Using the lyophilizer
Press "auto" to start the vacuum and refrigeration
wait for the pressure and temperature to drop all the way down.
place frozen sample in a chamber, and place the lid on. Make sure that the lid is fully secure.
If there are already samples lyophilizing, be sure to close their valves before adding your chamber.
valves are open when the indentation is facing the tube leading to the chamber
push your chamber into a stem, then open the valve
then open the valves of the other chambers
If the alarm light is flashing, alert Alireza
To remove your sample, you only have to close the valve for your other chamber. You don't need to close the other chamber valves.
If you are the last one to use the lyophilizer, press "auto" again to turn off the machine
NOTE: Never turn off the side switch!
Then open the central chamber and take it off
use a large kimwipe to wipe off the water that accumulated inside the machine
