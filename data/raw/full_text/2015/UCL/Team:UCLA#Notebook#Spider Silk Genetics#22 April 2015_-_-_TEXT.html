1 Bacterial Transformation
∙ Observed many colonies growing on the plates. We will do colony PCR to verify proper insertion.
2 Colony PCR
∙ Picked four colonies from each plate. Resuspended each each colony in 100 uL water. Used protocol below:

3 Results
∙ Cast 1.0% gel to visualize.
Figure 1: Colony PCR to verify incorporation of insert.
∙ We picked colonies 3 and 4 from each construct and grew 5 mL liquid culture for miniprep and sequencing tomorrow. Renumbered the cultures to 1 and 2 respectively.
4 Column purification of MaSp2 PCA
∙ Used zymo kit to purify yesterday’s MaSp2 PCA reactions. Eluted in 10 uL EB. Results below:
