Intro: Picked colonies from Mutant 10 transformation.
Only 2 colonies in total grew up from all three serial dilution plates. Both colonies were found on the first, and most concentrated, plate. These colonies were scraped off with a pipette tip and placed in 10 mL LB with chloramphenicol using sterile technique. The starter culture was incubated at 37C overnight in a shaker.
