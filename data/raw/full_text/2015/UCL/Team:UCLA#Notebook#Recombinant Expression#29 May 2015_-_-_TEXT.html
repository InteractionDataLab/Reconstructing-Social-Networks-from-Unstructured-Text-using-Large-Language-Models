Starter Culture Failure #3Â : Back in Black
Starter cultures grown on Wednesday were taken from the incubator at 1300 hours (~48 hours) and OD600 was taken on the samples.
Tamura Plate 3 -- OD600: 1.273, Tamura Plate 4-- OD600: 1.246, Tamura Plate 5: OD600: 1.279.
Plasmid was mini prepped using the Promega PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System
Plasmid ran on gel to verify size of plasmid, sequenced to verify proper insert, the will be used to transform into BL21(DE3) cells.
Julian's Work
I inoculated a 500mL culture in LB with Chlor at a 1000X dilution. I used a 5mL starter culture grown overnight also in LB. I am measuring the OD every hour or so. After the first hour it was onlt 0.02 so I will let it grow for longer before inoculating.
This culture will be used to make the hydrogel assays.
