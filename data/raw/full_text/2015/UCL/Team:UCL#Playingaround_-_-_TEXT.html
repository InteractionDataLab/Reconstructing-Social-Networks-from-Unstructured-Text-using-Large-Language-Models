The number of microorganisms in human gut is higher than the number of human cells in our body. Their metabolic activity equals that of liver and plays crucial role in many key processes such as digestion, drug metabolism, or functioning of the immune system...
Studies in mice have shown that the gut microbiome is also capable of  influencing the chemistry of our brain, thus regulating our behaviour , anxiety , mood , cognition and pain ...
Being inspired by this emerging research area, UCL iGEM 2015 team wants to explore the modulation of the gut bacteria as a strategy for developing novel treatments for mental health disorders. Ultimately, our goal is to harness synthetic biology to make people happy!
