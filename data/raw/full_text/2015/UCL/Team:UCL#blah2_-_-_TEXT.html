Background
The term psychobiotics describes an emerging class of mind-altering probiotics that possess the ability to produce neuroactive compounds. The molecules associated with mammalian neurotransmission that have been isolated from gut bacteria include gamma-butyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine [1]. When secreted into intestinal lumen, these molecules can modulate the neural signalling within the enteric nervous system which communicates with brain via the vagus nerve, therefore influencing brain’s biochemistry and host’s behaviour.
“It is well recognized that some bacteria within the human GIT have the capacity to produce many neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. For example, Lactoba cillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. have been reported to produce GABA; Escherichia spp., and Bacillus spp. have been reported to produce norepinephrine; Streptococcus spp., Escherichia spp. and Enterococcus spp. have been reported to produce serotonin; Bacillus spp. have been reported to produce dopamine, and Lactobacillus spp. have been reported to produce acetylcholine and histamine. [...] Other bacterially-produced metabolites with proven neuroactive func- tions include short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and long chain fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). “
