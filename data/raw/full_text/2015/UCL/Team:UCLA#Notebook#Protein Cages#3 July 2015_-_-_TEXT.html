Intro: Today I created glycerol stocks of Yeates' cage cells.
The stocks were created at 10:00 am, after letting the cells incubate in 5 mL LB overnight. Given the length of the incubation time, it is possible that the cells grew past the log phase. Three cryo tubes were each filled with 0.5 mL of iGEM 50% glycerol stock (sterile filtered 4.23.15 by VCL). Then 0.5 mL of bacterial culture was pipetted into each tube. After vortexing to mix, the tubes were labeled and stored in David's section of the -80C freezer in Sri's lab. They were placed in the upper right quadrant of the box with all three vials in a row. The remaining cell solution was bleached and disposed.
