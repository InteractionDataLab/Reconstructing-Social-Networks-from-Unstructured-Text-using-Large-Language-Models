Safe Shipment
Solutions to Problems involving the sending of DNA parts to the Registry
Problem 1: How to ensure the safe arrival of the DNA parts to the Registry
By familiarizing with the procedure
Starting from iGEMâ€™s website http://parts.igem.org/Help:Submission, we learnt that we should first add the part to the registry, use the submission kit, track the mail, and etcetera.
By setting a flexible time frame
Many accidents, such as natural disaster, do occur when sending mail locally, let along overseas. Therefore, make sure there are backup copies on hand and allocate sufficient time to resend the part(s) if need be. First, check with local postal office to know the amount of time needed for the mail to be sent to the Registry. Then, count back the days to find the actual deadline. When sending the parts, double check to make sure the parts are correct. If the parts are incorrect in any form, notify iGEM (hq (at) igem . org) immediately.
