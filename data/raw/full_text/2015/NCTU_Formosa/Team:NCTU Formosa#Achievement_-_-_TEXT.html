Judging Criteria
Golden Medal
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
We introduced our ideas to doctors, Biotech company- ApexBio, and law expert, asking some questions to realize problems and values of our project. Also, visiting the recovery cancer patient made us  realize the patient's realistic circumstance and the importance of health. Besides, we held "Be bald" activity for public to know more about the importance of the pre-diagnosis of cancer treatments and  introduced iGEM to them during the activity.
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way.
We help HSNU to clone biobricks, help Mindao to analyze protein amino acid component,provide Zamorano with our own biobrick from last year,and assist NTHU to form the first igem team in their school.
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part , and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We improved the function of Lpp-OmpA by adding the changeable scFv with a cut side of restriction enzyme called NcoI.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. See more in the Result.
We proved that the binding specificity of E.Cotectors by cell staining experiment and that suggest the scFv have successfully displayed on the surface of E.coli.
Silver Medal
Submit the new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. We constructed 23 biobricks.
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization in the Main Page section of the Registry.        And submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We constructed 23 biobricks and conducted a series of experiments to verify their functions.
Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of Human Practices in the context of your project.
We hold iGEM Asia Conference for 27 teams to meetup, exchange ideas, make friends and cooperate mutually. We also hold biocamp for high school students and introduce iGEM.        We designed a survey for public to recognize the pre-diagnosis of targeted drugs treatment.
Bronze Medal
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete the Judging form .
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear Attribution of each aspect of your project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
What have we done in the project?
Co-tramsforming Biobricks for creating Customized Detection Platform.
We improve the function of a previously existing BioBrick Lpp-OmpA by adding the changeable scFv with a cut side of restriction enzyme called NcoI.
We built three types of biobrick libraries: scFv , color signal and GBP to display on E.coli’s outer membrane for creating customized detection platform.
With co-transformation, we offered several customized combinations, such as E.Cotector with different scFv of targeted drugs and different color signal or with GBP.
We proved that the binding specificity of E.Cotectors by cell staining experiment. Plus, it showed scFv have successfully displayed on the surface of E.coli.
Our E.Cotector succeeded in displaying GBP on the surface and binding on gold chip.
What have we done more than the project?
We constructed 23 biobricks and conducted a series of experiments to verify their functions.
We designed the mechanism to guarantee the safety on the gene level and the microorganism level.
To make our safety mechanism be more complete, we found out the optimal way to process and the best condition for conserving fluorescence proteins by modeling.
With our modeling, we realized how E.Cotector would grow and the condition of protein displaying.
Consulting with law expert to realize the law we should notice for our E.Cotector.
We introduced our ideas to doctors and asked some questions for us to realize problems and values of our project.
We introduced our ideas to Biotech company- ApexBio and asked some questions for us to realize problems and values of our project.
We designed a survey for public to recognize the pre-diagnosis of targeted drugs treatment.
We held “Be bald” activity for public to know more about the crucial of the pre-diagnosis of cancer treatments and also introduced iGEM with them during the activity.
Visiting the recovery cancer patient made us more realize the patient’s realistic circumstance and the importance of health.
We also hold Biocamp for high school students and introduce iGEM.
We have help other igem team for example we help HSNU to clone biobricks, help Mindao to analyze protein amino acid component, and we assist NTHU to form the first igem team in their school and they prepared to participate giant jamboree next year.
We held iGEM Asia Conference for 27 teams to meetup, exchange ideas, make friends and cooperate mutually.
We promoted the communication and the cooperation among various rofessional fields such as synthetic biology, measurement technology, immunology, and medical science via the participation in iGEM and the accomplishment of the project.
What are the value in the field of measurement?
Simultaneously detected the multiple antigens.
For more quantitative data and more application on precise measurements, we testified the function of GBP to bind on gold with the concept of Biosensor.
Enhanced the process yield in immobilization of antibodies on the medium gold surface.
The cost of using our E.cotectors is lower than using monoclonal antibodies targeted drugs directly on measuring antigens.
What are the value in the field of disgnosis?
Offer a brand new direct method for doctors to determining the usage of monoclonal-antibody-targeted drugs.
Directly used the monoclonal-antibody-targeted-drugs to detect the corresponding antigen on the cancer cells.
Provided a direct, personalized and customized pre-diagnosis of targeted drugs treatment detection platform.
Offer the prescription of combination therapy to doctors.
