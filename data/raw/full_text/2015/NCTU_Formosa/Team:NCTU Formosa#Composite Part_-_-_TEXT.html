BBa_K1694013
OmpA-anti-VEGF
BBa_K1694014
OmpA-anti-EGFR
BBa_K1694015
OmpA-anti-HER2
In order to change the scFv parts easily, we added a NcoI restriction site between OmpA and scFv so that we can change various scFv DNA sequence using the NcoI restriction enzyme.

Pcons+RBS+OmpA-anti-EGFR
BBa_K1694025
Pcons+RBS+OmpA-anti-HER2
By ligating the constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23101 ), strong ribosome binding site ( BBa_B0034 ) and Lpp-OmpA-scFv, we were able to display scFv on the E.coli outer membrane continuously.  Having this part, we can co-transform with other parts in order to produce color as the detection signal.
In addition, by co-transforming these different types of E.coli with different fluorescence or color as signals, we are able to create a platform which can detect multimarker and consequently achieve combination therapy.

BBa_K1694045
Pcons+RBS+OmpA-anti-HER2+RBS+BFP+Ter
The most commonly constructing way of composite parts is to ligate the required parts together. We also provide this kind of parts.
At the back of the Lpp-OmpA-scFv part, we ligated the weaker ribosome biding site ( BBa_B0030 ), different fluorescent protein and terminator ( BBa_J61048 ) to make it continuously and simultaneously express the fluorescence and the scFv. We used a weak ribosome binding site to ensure that scFv's production will not be affected.

Chromoprotein is another example of what can be added when making your own probe.
We constructed this part as the Pcons+RBS+OmpA-scFv+RBS+fluorescent protein+Terminator part.
BBa_K1694027
Pcons+RBS+FadL-GBP
By ligating the induced promoter ( BBa_J23110 ), ribosome binding site ( BBa_B0034 ) and FadL-GBP, we can continuously display the GBP on the E.coli outer membrane.
Then we co-transform the OmpA-scFv parts and this FadL-GBP parts into the same E.coli, hence allowing our E.coli to bind on gold chips and detect antigens simultaneously.
BBa_K1694037
Pcons+RBS+FadL-GBP+RBS+GFP+Ter
With this part, we can test the GBP function by observing the green fluorescence on the gold chip. Terminator  is ( BBa_B0015 ).
