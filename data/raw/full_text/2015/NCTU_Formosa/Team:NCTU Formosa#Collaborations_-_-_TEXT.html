Collaborations
We have assisted other iGEM team in several dimensions. Interaction between iGEM teams definitely benefits the growth of synthetic biology. At the same time, we are very glad to achieve iGEM’s core value, which is to share resources with other teams.
Zamorano
This year Zamorano team focused on making a toxin that targets insects. They believe our biobricks from last year’s project, which are BBa_K1415202, BBa_K1415205 and the BBa_11415206 could be really helpful to them, hence they contacted us through our Facebook fan page. Our team shipped it to them immediately. Hopefully, our parts can really aid their project.
HSNU-TAIPEI
This year is HSNU's first year to participate in the iGEM competition. As a high school iGEM team, they demonstrated extreme team spirit. We sent them previous year iGEM kits and helped them finish their experiment more smoothly. Providing them with our full help, we hope that more high school students will participate in the iGEM competition.
Mindao
We helped Mindao when they called for helping them analyze protein amino acid component.
NTHU ( National Tsing Hua University )
We promoted the iGEM competition in NTHU. Also shared experience on how to run an iGEM team by inviting them to participate in our meet up. Moreover, we invited them to visit our lab. All of the help contributed lead to them forming their first iGEM team and they are going to join the giant jamboree in 2016.
Oxford
We really appreciate one of the member of Oxford team came to help in editing wiki page with his better sense of English which is a great help for us.
