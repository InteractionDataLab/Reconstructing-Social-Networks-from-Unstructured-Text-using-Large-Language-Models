Be Bald!!
Our team walked out of lab and launched an activity in NCTU. We called it “Be Bald!” In order to inform people the specificity of targeted drug.
We would like to provide a chance for people to see their appearance without hair which is a common cancer image for people. People react to their new look with a sense of weirdness. Meanwhile, we told our testers that cancer patients face the hairless look because of chemo therapy which is the most common therapy. In this way, our team focus on the targeted drug detection which would help a great number of people and lower the damage to human body and thus reduce possibility of hair loss. A lot of people took part in “Be Bald” and told us they felt what we are doing will benefit many people and it’s so important and meaningful. They would love to support us with all their hearts. After “Be Bald”, all of our teammates felt a sense of achievement that we could really help people and this really motivate us and boost our morale.
