The only thing we can detect is everything.
Who are we
NCTU_Formosa created an organization-APOllO, which stands for Almighty Probe of scFv Organization. APOllO             devoted to developing detection technology by utilizing antibodies. In 2015, We cooperated with iGEM with Synthetic            Biology to develop a brand new detection platform.
What's new
APOllO E.Cotector:
Our organization create a customized scFv detection platform by co-transforming any desired plasmid. ScFv utilizing antigen-antibody interaction can act as probes. Our E.Cotector can therefore have the function of a detector.
What do we care
In 2015, we focus on helping doctors select the appropriate candidates for monoclonal-antibody targeted drug for patient's treatment in a more inexpensive way. If the cost for diagnosis decreases, more patients can afford it. Therefore, more patients can be prescribed and treated, lowering the mortality rate of cancer.
