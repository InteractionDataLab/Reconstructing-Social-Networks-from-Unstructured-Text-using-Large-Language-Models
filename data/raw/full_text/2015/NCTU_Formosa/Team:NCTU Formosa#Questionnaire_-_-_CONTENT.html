The purpose of the survey was to collect and analyze statistics on the public’s understanding of cancer and targeted therapy.</P><P>Of those participants, 55.1% are female and 44.9% are male (survey question 1). 3.3% are educators, 74% are students, no medical professionals, 7.2% are service sector personnel, and 5.5% are from other sectors (survey question 2). Overall, the following results cover a total of 568 contributors.</P><P>The study was conducted by means of Google Forms posted on the team and personal Facebook pages. The multiple choice questionnaire was generally in true and false format and includes the latest medical statistics.</P><P>One significant result of interest is the amount of partakers willing to consider synthetic biology applications (question 16). Only 8.6% of the public disapproves of the research to reduce the time and cost of pre-evaluation for targeted drugs using genetically engineered organisms. </P><P>The average score of participants was 51.7%, which meant the majority did not pass the knowledge quiz (a pass was considered above 60%). Based on this survey, the modern society has a low understanding of cancer and targeted therapy. </P><P>This survey has helped APOllO interact and inform 568 Facebook users with the latest cancer and targeted therapy information. With the latest product line, APOllO is seeking to improve the cancer treatment process to increase the number of patients willing to use targeted therapy. Our new product not only lowers the cost of diagnosis, it is also a multi-detection platform. With a switch of the scFv antibody on our E. cotectors, we can detect other antigens.</P><P>In addition, through the survey’s inquisitive questions, APOllO can help generate the public’s empathy to assist underprivileged families and their loved ones on their voyage to fight cancer—whether through understanding or monetary means.</P></DIV><DIV class="image">
