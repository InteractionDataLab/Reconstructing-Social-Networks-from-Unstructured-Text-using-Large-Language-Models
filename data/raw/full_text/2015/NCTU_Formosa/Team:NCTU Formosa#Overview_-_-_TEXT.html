Overview
Customized Detection Platform
This year, APOllO, introduce a revolutionary product, a customized detecting platform. We call it the E.Cotector.
In our product, we built three individual biobrick libraries of scFv probes and color signal and Gold Binding Polypeptide (GBP). Probes detect the target we want. Fluorescence protein or chromoprotein expresses signal for observation. GBP acts as a bridge to connect our product to gold, which enables our product to be applied to biosensors. Our customers can spontaneously choose from our libraries, pair up any biobricks. Next, comes the most crucial part of our project. Our team will then co-transform the plasmids into E. coli. Our customized detecting platform, The APOllO E.Cotector, is therefore born.  By co-transforming plasmids, it not only helps us customize our product every which way for our customers but also brings us a major advantage in our manufacturing procedure. We no longer have to build lengthy biobricks, which tremendously increases our manufacturing efficiency.
Health and Medical Detection Platform
With our hit product, E.Cotector, we can focus on health and medical dimension. We want to provide a convenient and efficient diagnosis for prescribing personalized targeted drug therapy via tissue biopsies. Therefore, we chose single chain variable fragments (scFv), which are directly from monoclonal antibody, targeted drugs. ScFv acts as our probe to detect specific biomarkers. Our customer can pair up any scFv with any color signal. By changing various kinds of scFv on the surfaces of E.Cotector, it can identify multimarkers and suggest appropriate different kinds of targeted drugs.
Our E.Cotector can consequently bind to various targeted antigen also simultaneously express color as signal for instant observation. We provide another plasmid of Gold Binding Polypeptide for customers to pair up. Pairing up scFv and GBP can achieve quantitative detection as a biosensor. In conclusion, the customized APOllO E.Cotector will bring a brand new era for pre-diagnosis target drugs treatment.
