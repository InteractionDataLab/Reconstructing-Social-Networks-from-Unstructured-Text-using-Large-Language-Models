Besides presentation, poster time during every meal not only fed us with exquisitely prepared food but also knowledge. All these activities enable us to rethink our project with different angles, improving our 27 projects into a new level. 
	At the end of the conference, each team were given special gifts, embrace bunch of friends, and feel happy and proud to be igemers. After the conference, we planned a day trip in Taipei, visiting National Palace Museum and Taipei 101. Both are the must-go attraction that nobody would miss when coming to Taiwan.</P></DIV><DIV class="content"><H1>Skype meetup</H1><P>

With all these cross-cultural meet ups, our lives had been spiced up.
