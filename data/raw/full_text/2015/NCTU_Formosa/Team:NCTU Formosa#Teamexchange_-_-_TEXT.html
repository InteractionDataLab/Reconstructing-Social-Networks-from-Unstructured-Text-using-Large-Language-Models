iGEM Asian Conference
The perfect event that NCTU_Formosa had been preparing for so long started on 7/19, which lasted for 5 days. We had 27 teams present, about 210 attendees from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We even have teams from India and Kazakhstan join us during the meetup through the internet. So all the process of Asian conference is open to the whole world. Throughout the 5-day conference, each team had prepared presentation for their amazing projects and ideas.  After all the presentations, our professors also as judges will give pieces of advice to the teams. Afterwards, Q&A time was a chance to interact with each team. Besides presentation, poster time during every meal not only fed us with exquisitely prepared food but also knowledge. All these activities enable us to rethink our project with different angles, improving our 27 projects into a new level.   At the end of the conference, each team were given special gifts, embrace bunch of friends, and feel happy and proud to be igemers. After the conference, we planned a day trip in Taipei, visiting National Palace Museum and Taipei 101. Both are the must-go attraction that nobody would miss when coming to Taiwan.
Skype meetup
We had 4 engaging internet discussions with teams that were KAIT_ Japan, Amoy_ China, TU Delft, and Oxford. We always learned so much from each team’s amazing idea. After exchanging ideas, we were amazed by them and what’s more, as we talked to different people from different culture, culture shock and multicultural interaction experience were something we were excited about. With all these cross-cultural meet ups, our lives had been spiced up.

We also held mini conference in Taiwan with Mindao and HSNU on June 8 to help them with their project about modeling and show how our team work on June 7th. We have organize a one day mini conference. At first, we have presentation time to every group. After presentation, we also have Q&A time to give some pieces advice also assist them to have a better experimental design and any confronted problem. We also teach them basic experimental skills, for example, ligation and digestion. At the end, we had vigorous discussions with as many as possible people. Now, each team have better understanding about synthetic biology and their project.
Mini Conference with CGU on June 14
The first-recruited team CGU come for exchanging ideas about their project. Out of excitement, it just happened to be that our projects were also about improving medical problem. We were surprised that we were helpful to each other in this conference. Besides, we also give them some pieces advice to manage their new team to promote their working efficiency.
Mini conference with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology on July 3
It was a very excited day as there was a meetup with iGEMers from New Zealand Auckland IGEM team and South China University of Technology in NCTU. The main focus point on this meetup was to share and discuss the experiences of forming the iGEM teams. To make this discussion effective, our team previous leader also joined the meetup and so can provided more information with our friends. We discussed about the ways of recruiting and training members. After knowing the experiences of each other, those experiences can be a useful references for us in the future. Our instructor, Professor Chen also shared his experiences and thought about iGEM. We appreciate their coming!
Mini conference with Professor Westenberg on July 30
Professor Westenberg from Missouri University of Science and Technology came to NCTU. He gave us some valuable advice on how we can alter our experiment. We had a really great time-sharing each other's project, and show him around our campus.
Newsletter
We took part in Amoy newsletters no 1, no2 and no3. We have shown how our team works. The best thing is that we shared our experiences to harmonize with each team member, hoping to share the key to success. We also wrote about the ethics topic that happened in Guangzhou’s Sun Yat-sen University about modifying human embryos. Lastly, we also talked about the progressing project. We had been proud and happy to share all our knowledge, our opinions and with the world.
