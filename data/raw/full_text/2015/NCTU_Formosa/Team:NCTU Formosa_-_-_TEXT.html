The only thing we can detect is everything.
Who we are
NCTU_Formosa created an organization—APOllO, which stands for Almighty Probe of scFv Organization. APOllO is devoted to developing detection technology by utilizing antibodies. In 2015, we cooperated with iGEM to create a brand new detection platform using synthetic biology.
What's new
APOllO E.Cotector:
Our organization creates a customized scFv detection platform by co-transforming any desired plasmid in to E. coli. ScFv utilizes antigen-antibody interaction to act as probes. Therefore, our E.Cotector has the function of a detector.
What we care about
In 2015, we focused on helping doctors select appropriate candidates for monoclonal-antibody targeted drug treatments—reducing the price of patients' treatment. If the cost for diagnosis decreases, more patients can afford it. Therefore lowering the mortality rate of cancer.
