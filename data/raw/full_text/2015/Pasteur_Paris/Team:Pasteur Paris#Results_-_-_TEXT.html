pNP-Assay:
Estimation of the activity of NB-Esterase, slowest enzyme of our degradation chain.
Insertion of the NB-Esterase (BBa_K808030) in the plasmid pDG011.
Transformation of BAP1 with the construct NB-Esterase (Bba_K808030) in the plasmid pDG011.
Isolation of three clones who have our construct NB-Esterase (Bba_K808030) in the plasmid pDG011.
Demonstration of the degradation of the 4-NitroPhenyl Butyrate by our modified BAP1 with NB-Esterase in the pDG011 plasmid.
TPA toxicity:
Assessment of the toxicity: Test of the TPA toxicity thanks to a variation of the TPA concentration.
Determination that TPA is not degraded.
Solubilization of TPA and amelioration of the method.
Operon assembly:
Succesful assembly of 2 of our 4 gene clusters (BBa_K1622000 and BBa_K1622001).
Optimization of DNA sequences for E.coli.
Gibson assembly:
BioBricks submitted to be BioBrick registry.
Bba_K1622000: assembly of the Glycoaldehyde Dehydrogenase (BBa_K936011) and the Glycoaldehyde Reductase (BBa_K936023) in the plasmid PSB1C3.
Bba_K1622001: assembly of the NB-Esterase (BBa_K808030) and the TPA transporteur (BBa_K808007).
Interlab Study:
Successful building of the 3 devices.
Characterization of the 3 devices using a Tecan micro-plate reader.
Quantification of the number of Plasmids in each bacteria.
Determination of the best Promoter.
Transformation in DH5-alpha of each promoter (BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106, BBa_J23117) and the controls GFP (BBa_I13405) and WT.
qPCR of the transformed cells to determinate the plasmid copy number per strain.
Fluorescence test of the GFP expression and determination of the fluorescence per plasmid.
Problems:
Gibson assembly:
the exonuclease contained in the Master Mix uncovered the Lox Recombination sites because they were too close to the overlapping ends.
Interlab Study:
Different strain for qPCR and Fluorescence test.
Modeling:
Because of the absence of experimental results, we can't model our enzymatic system.
CRE:
the yeast assembly did not work.
pNP assay:
Two of our tests are less decisive because we didn't wait for a long time to see a real difference enter control and modified bacteria.
Transformation of the construct very hard.
