The iGEM Pasteur team imagined the HumHub platform to be a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams. Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
<CENTER>WE IMAGINED A FEW RUBRICS ON THIS PLATFORM.</CENTER></P><P align="justify"><B>« First step in Igem competition »</B>
This tab is dedicated for every new iGEM team. In fact, our team is taking part in this competition for the first time and we admit that we had a lot of uncertainties about the proceedings of the competition, the organization, how to use different tools available…
<B>« Synbio tools »</B>
One of the major problem that we encountered was to determine a lab calendar of all the experiment we had to do. Also, we can imagine a rubric that will regroup all tools that are used by other teams and some video tutorials about how to use this tools. 
This rubric would be a great help for new teams that are looking for some experiences and advertisements from experimented teams.
<B>« Collaborations »</B>
One of the philosophy of the iGEM is sharing. Communication and collaborations between teams is very important. However, it is difficult to start a conversation with a team without a real discussion platform! Sometimes, teams don’t answer our mails or it just takes a long time. Video conferences are possible by Skype, but we have to ask for a personal account from a team member to discuss. 

It would be easier to centralize all team and team members’ emails on a database that will be accessible in the HumHub platform. We could communicate faster. If possible, even develop a messaging app between teams and team members to facilitate the exchange.

Here, teams would be able to talk about their project and to share with other teams that are working on a close field. Each team can use different tags in order to identify their projects and facilitate the  Private communication between two, three or as many teams will be possible. Public communication with every team will also be possible, for example to share the surveys. Moreover, any team would be allowed to share new ideas of project to create together. We imagine that someone will post an idea of project and interested teams would be able to be put in touch with them.
<B>« Forum »</B>
It could also be interesting to create a page where the general public and people interested in iGEM could interact. It would be a way to promote iGEM among non-scientifics.</P><P><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stockholm/humhub" target="_blank">Click here to read the HumHub report of iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Aalto-Helsinki.</A></P></DIV><P class="titrepage">Cloning guide</P><DIV class="carregris"><P align="justify" style="text-indent:3em;"> iGEM <B>TU Eindhoven</B> started to make a cloning guide for new iGEM teams to be able to make a clear choice on what cloning method to use.
