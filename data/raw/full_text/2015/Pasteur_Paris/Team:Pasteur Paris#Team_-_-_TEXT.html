Claudia Demarta-Gatsi
I am a third year Phd student working on malaria immunology, a field that I love! I like to find out how our body works and the idea that science can help people!
Muriel Gugger
I am a Cyanobacteriologist trained during the last 15 years and I am the Head of the Cyanobacteria Collection at the Institut Pasteur. I enjoy using omics to decipher the puzzle of their natural products.
Caroline Lambert
I am a second year Phd student working on the immunological control of retroviruses in Human, and I am so excited to be a part of the iGEM adventure!!
Eric Legrand
I am a researcher working on malaria drug resistance at the Institut Pasteur.
Advisors
Johann Beghain
I am an engineer in bio-informatics working on malaria resistance at the Institut Pasteur.
Mélanie Criqui
I'm studying oncology at the Paris-Sud University. I aquired my iGEM experiment last years when I was a member of the iGEM Paris-Saclay team and thanks to that, I decided to join this new team as an advisor to give them advices
