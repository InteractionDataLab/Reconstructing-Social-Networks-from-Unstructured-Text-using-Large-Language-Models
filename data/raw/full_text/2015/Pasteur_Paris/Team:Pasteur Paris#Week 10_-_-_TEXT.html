Toxicity and solubility of TPA (Terephthalic acid)
Dissolution of TPA in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The best concentration obtained is 62 mg/l
Dilution of TPA stock in LB Broth => TPA  precipitates at a concentration of 3.9 g/l, maximum concentration in LB Broth is  0.9 mg/l
Solubilization of TPA by NaOH
Creation of a stock solution of soluble TPA in water at 0.5 mol/l
Test of the TPA Solubilization in LB Broth
Preparation of different media containing terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG):
Media 1 to 10 are made in solid form:
M9
M9 + TPA (1.2 mM)
M9 + TPA (6.0 mM)
M9 + TPA (12.0 mM)
M9 + sucrose (1.2 mM)
M9 + sucrose (6.0 mM)
M9 + sucrose (12.0 mM)
M9 + sucrose + TPA (6.0 mM)
M9 + sucrose + TPA (1.2 mM)
Media 11 to 15 are made in both solid and liquid form:
LB Broth
LB + TPA (1.2 mM)
LB + TPA (6.0 mM)
LB + TPA (12.0 mM)
LB + TPA (20.0 mM)
Growth curve of BAP 1 (E. coli, kindly provided by Blaine Pfeifer, U. Buffalo)in media 11 to 14 in order to assess TPA toxicity.
Plating of BAP 1 bacteria on all solid media to assess TPA toxicity and the ability of TPA to be used as a carbon source.
Enzymatic Assay of NB-Esterase
XbaI ans PstI enzymatic digestion of the Biobrick BBa_K808030 and pDG011 plasmid.
Gel purification  of the digested fragments on 0.8% agarose gel.
Ligation of  pDG011 plasmid and BBa_K808030 using T4 DNA ligase.
Gel migration on  0.8% agarose gel.
Figure 8: Gel for verification of the ligation of BBa_K808030 and pDG011 plasmid.
There is no band for the ligation sample.
