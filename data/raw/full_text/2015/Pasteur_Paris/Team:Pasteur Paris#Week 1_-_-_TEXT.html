Reception and bacterial storage of Biobricks
Resuspension of Biobricks (BBa) DNA in 15 µl of DNAse, RNAse free water: BBa_K808007,  BBa_K808010, BBa_K808011, BBa_K808012, BBa_K808013, BBa_K808014, BBa_K936000,  BBa_K316003.
Storage at -20°C.
Transformation in DH5-α competent cells  purchased from Invitrogen (# 18265-017) was done following the transformation protocol. (BBa_K808007, BBa_K808010, BBa_K808011,  BBa_K808012, BBa_K808013, BBa_K808014, BBa_K936000, BBa_K316003).
Cells were plated on LB + chloramphenicol 34 µg/ml (Cm 34).
Incubation  overnight at 37°C.
Storage at 4°C.
