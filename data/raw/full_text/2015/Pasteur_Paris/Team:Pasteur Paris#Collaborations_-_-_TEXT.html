Presentation video of PlastiCure!
This video has been made by iGEM IONIS, during the Parisian Meetup!
Parisian Meetup - iGEM Pasteur
     
     
     
iGEM Pasteur team organized the Parisian meetup on Monday July 6th at the Pasteur Institute. The teams iGEM Evry, iGEM IONIS_Paris, iGEM Paris_Saclay, and iGEM Paris_Bettencourt were present! Click here for more information
      
      
Francophone Meetup - iGEM Bordeaux
  
 
 
 
 
Three members of our team participated to the Francophone meetup hosted by iGEM Bordeaux during the last week-end of August. 24 students from iGEM Bordeaux, iGEM Paris_Saclay, iGEM Toulouse, iGEM Aix-Marseille, iGEM Pasteur, but also iGEM KU Leuven (Belgium) and iGEM EPF Lausanne (Swiss) were present to introduce about the different projects and discuss around synbio thematics.

HumHub Platform
The HumHub Platform, a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams!!! Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
→ Why does iGEM need digital platforms for collaboration?
As iGEM grows in size and projects become more complicated, digital platforms for collaboration present a possibility for teams to work on challenges together, and for members of teams to collaborate on projects while not in the lab. Today, many iGEM teams use different established platforms to solve these needs. The communication between the different teams is complicated
→ What needs are met today?
Dropbox to share documents, Google Docs to write collaborative documents, Facebook to communicate between team members and with general public, Calendars.
→ What needs are not met today?
A discussion forum for all iGEM teams, closed spaces for collaboration between teams, platform for discussing BioBricks and past projects.
iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Aalto-Helsinki wrote collaboratively the HumHub report and it has been edited by iGEM Alto-Helsinki and iGEM Pasteur.
→ Here is the report written by iGEM Pasteur:
How does iGEM Pasteur imagine the HumBub platform? The iGEM Pasteur team imagined the HumHub platform to be a new and original communication tool for all iGEM teams. Indeed, every iGEM team will be able to communicate, share and discover different ideas and experiences.
WE IMAGINED A FEW RUBRICS ON THIS PLATFORM.
« First step in Igem competition » This tab is dedicated for every new iGEM team. In fact, our team is taking part in this competition for the first time and we admit that we had a lot of uncertainties about the proceedings of the competition, the organization, how to use different tools available… « Synbio tools » One of the major problem that we encountered was to determine a lab calendar of all the experiment we had to do. Also, we can imagine a rubric that will regroup all tools that are used by other teams and some video tutorials about how to use this tools.  This rubric would be a great help for new teams that are looking for some experiences and advertisements from experimented teams. « Collaborations » One of the philosophy of the iGEM is sharing. Communication and collaborations between teams is very important. However, it is difficult to start a conversation with a team without a real discussion platform! Sometimes, teams don’t answer our mails or it just takes a long time. Video conferences are possible by Skype, but we have to ask for a personal account from a team member to discuss. It would be easier to centralize all team and team members’ emails on a database that will be accessible in the HumHub platform. We could communicate faster. If possible, even develop a messaging app between teams and team members to facilitate the exchange. Here, teams would be able to talk about their project and to share with other teams that are working on a close field. Each team can use different tags in order to identify their projects and facilitate the  Private communication between two, three or as many teams will be possible. Public communication with every team will also be possible, for example to share the surveys. Moreover, any team would be allowed to share new ideas of project to create together. We imagine that someone will post an idea of project and interested teams would be able to be put in touch with them. « Forum » It could also be interesting to create a page where the general public and people interested in iGEM could interact. It would be a way to promote iGEM among non-scientifics.

Cloning guide
iGEM TU Eindhoven started to make a cloning guide for new iGEM teams to be able to make a clear choice on what cloning method to use. For this guide iGEM TU Eindhoven was looking for different teams who are working with one of the following cloning methods:
Classical Cloning.
Biobricking.
Rapid DNA prototyping.
3A assembly.
Golden Gate Assembly.
Gateway Cloning technology.
TA cloning/ TOPO TA cloning.
In-Fusion.
Ligation independent cloning.
Di or Multi cistronic cloning.
iGEM Pasteur took part in writing this cloning guide in collaboration with TU Eindhoven. We explained the principle of the Gibson Assembly, our design and our experiences with this technic, the materials we used. You can find our report at page 33 of the guide!
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
Newsletter for iGEM Competition
The Newsletter for iGEM Competition is being published for the second year in a row. This year, it is the result of a collaboration between our team, iGEM Amoy and iGEM Paris_Bettencourt. 52 teams all around the world introduced their programs, shared details of experiments, asked for help, and replied to requirements from counterparts. Seven issues are published this year, among which are three special issues. iGEM Pasteur wrote articles in the issues n°2, 5 and 7. The topics are:
Issue 1: How to set up and operate an iGEM team (special issue).
Issue 2: Project Introduction and Ethical Discussions.
Issue 3: Projects of the different teams.
Issue 4: Current situation of synthetic biology in different countries (special issue).
Issue 5: Project Update, Interview, Human Practices and About Competition System.
Issue 6: Project Update from DRY and WET Lab teams, Open Questionnaire about Software, Collaboration and Problems.
Issue 7: Project Update, Interview, Human Practices and About Competition System.
   
   
   
   
   
Ethics for Synthetic Biology
"The iGEM team BIOSINT México considers that when people talk about ethics, specifically, the members of all the teams, lack of an ethical code to serve as a guide for considering the ethical aspects of the projects."
As an iGEM team, iGEM Pasteur thinks that it's a very important part of the iGEM and necessary for the evolution of the competition. We are encouraging this initiative! During this collaboration, iGEM Pasteur answered to the "suggested topics" survey and traduced from english to french, the ethics guidelines for the iGEM community: Ethics for Synthetic Biology.
