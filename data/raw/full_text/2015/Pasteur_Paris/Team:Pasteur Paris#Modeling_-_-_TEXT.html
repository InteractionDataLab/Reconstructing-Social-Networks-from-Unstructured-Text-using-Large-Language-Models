Our Project takes advantage of a multi enzyme metabolic pathway. We have decided to generate a model of enzyme kinetics for one to many successive steps in catalysis. We thought that it would be interresting to study the successive evolution of differents substrates in the cell. We used the model of Michaelis-Menten as the basis of our model. We have solved this equation with the Euler-Cauchy method.
The first goal of this part in our project was to generate a fitting curve fonction, but we have finally developped a tool that can generate solutions for many enzymatic systems respecting the Michaelis-Menten enzyme model. This tool can be used as a basis for creating a fitting curve function. But it can also be used as an education tool to provide another approach to the enzyme kinetic modeling.
To build this tool, we rely on a spreadsheet : Modeling tool for enzymatic reaction
For the description of an equation used in the spreadsheet : Model to describe enzymatic reaction
