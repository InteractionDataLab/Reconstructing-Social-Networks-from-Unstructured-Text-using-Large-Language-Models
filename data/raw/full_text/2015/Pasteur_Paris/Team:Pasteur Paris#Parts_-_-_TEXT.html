BBa_K1622000
Part Composition:
This part is composed of 3 subparts :
RBS: Ribosome Binding Site
Glycoaldehyde Dehydrogenase
Glycoaldehyde Reductase
Glycoaldehyde Dehydrogenase:
This enzyme catalyzes the Break-down of Glycoaldehyde into Glycolate, which is the third reaction of our PET degradation chain. We obtained the original sequence of this subpart in the iGEM registry of standard parts (BBa_936011). We optimized our sequence for E.coli and ordered the synthesis.
Glycoaldehyde Reductase:
The ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde reaction is catalyzed by this enzyme. In the same manner as the Glycoaldehyde Dehydrogenase, we got the original sequence on the registry (BBa_K936023), optimized those sequences for E.coli and ordered their synthesis.
Part Assembly
The subparts were assembled using Gibson Assembly. Prior to the actual assembly, we had to amplify our sequences via PCR using primers with extensions that contain overlapping sequences.
BBa_K1622001
Part Composition:
This part is a composite part composed of 2 Biobricks :
BBa_K808030: NB-Esterase
BBa_K808007: TPA Transporter
NB-Esterase:
This enzyme catalyses the degradation of PET into Terephthalic acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol. It is the first and slowest reaction of our degradation chain. Indeed, it takes two weeks to degrade PET.
We performed an enzymatic assay of NB-Esterase using 4-nitrophenylbutyrate as a substrate because it has a close chemical structure to PET and we figured that this enzyme digested pNP in our bacteria
TPA Transporter:
The NB-Esterase is present in the extracellular medium and cuts PET in this location. In order to be fully degraded, the TPA needs to be integrated to our chassis organism which is why we incorporated a transporter to our degradation operon.
Part Assembly:
The subparts were assembled using standard BioBrick Assembly.
