Yeast assembly
Treatment of the yeast using a homemade Zymolyase solution :
PBS pH 7.5 5 ml
glucose 5% to make a 2%  solution
Zymolyase 0.1 g (0.012-0.022 mg/mL)
Distilled water free RNAs/DNAs 1 mL
MidiPrep of pRS415
Dilution 1/50
DNA Concentration (ng/µl)
OD(230nm)

MidiPrep has been  digested to verified if the DNA correspond to the plasmid of interest or to an  other plasmid that is naturally present in  yeast.
BamHI digestion of pRS415  (with the phosphatase step).
We can see the presence of a streak about  7500 bp which seems to correspond to our plasmid pRS415.
DNA concentration  measurement.

PCR amplification of pRS415  with a mutagenesis kit using TE 8.1.
PCR amplification of pRS415  with a mutagenesis kit to insert nicks without TE 8.1.
A second trial has been done and TE 8.1 has been replaced by DNAse RNAse free water.
Gel migration on a 0.7%  agarose gel.
PCR amplification of pRS415  with new recommandations (protocol n°3)
Gel migration on a 0.7%  agarose gel.
Preparation of  electro-competent yeast cells.
Electroporation of  pRS415 and Cre with overlapping sequences.
 
TPA solubility
improvement of TPA  solubility in different conditions :
TPA (0.1 g) + Na2H2PO4(0.5 g)  in 150 ml of water: complete TPA solubilization.
TPA (0.1 g) + NaOH(0.5 g) in  150 ml of water: complete TPA solubilization.
Fluorescence measurements :
no TPAOH was observed on our  measurements, the reaction worked.
