Yeast Assembly
The Bacteria was first sent to the iGEM Toulouse and could have suffered from the travel so we ordered it again.
Reception of a STAB culture of the Biobrick BBa_J61047.
Spreading of BBa_J61047 on Petri dishes containing LB medium and LB + Cm 34 µg/ml.  No colonies were observed on Petri dishes containing LB + Cm 34 µg/ml but the bacteria grew on LB media.
Bacterial growth of the bacteria in liquid medium (5 ml of LB + Cm 34 µg/ml) and on a Petri dish (LB + Cm 34 µg/ml) and overnight incubation at 37°C.
Storage at 4°C.
Bacterial growth of the Bacteria in LB: incubation at 37°C for 1h30 at 140rpm.
100 µl of bacteria in 5 ml of LB
100 µl of bacteria in 5 ml of LB + Cm 34 µg/ml
5 ml of LB without bacteria as negative control
=> No bacterial growth was observed.
