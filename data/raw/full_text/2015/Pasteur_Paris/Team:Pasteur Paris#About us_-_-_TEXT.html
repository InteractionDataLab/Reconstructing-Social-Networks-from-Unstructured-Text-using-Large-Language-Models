We have the great honor to be the first iGEM team created at the Institut Pasteur. Our team brings together fourteen Bachelor and Master students trained in fields varying from biology and chemistry, to mathematics, journalism and political science. We are combining our skills and expertise, exchanging ideas and inspiration. A dozen of researchers are supervising us; they are staff scientists, post-docs, PhD students and technicians from the Institute, experts in various fields of research.
