We are from Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon.
The Students:
Jake Palumbo
Jake is wrapping up his final year at Pacific University. He is majoring in bioinformatics, and looking forward to pursuing systems and computational biology in graduate school. From early childhood, Jake has expressed direct interest in genetic and metabolic engineering. His obsession with swarm behavior and the "squishy dynamics" of the natural world has furthered him down this path. He is incredibly excited to participate in iGEM 2015, especially as the leader of the first team out of his home state of Oregon."
Mike Ashley
Mike is a junior at Pacific University majoring in business finance. He is beyond excited for the market potential of Sclerotite.
