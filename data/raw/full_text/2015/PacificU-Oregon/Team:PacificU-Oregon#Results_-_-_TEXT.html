Project Results
We have yet to create a functional version of Sclerotite. We lack control over the tanning process of the monomers we selected for study. As the school year progresses, we will be shuffling monomers, changing their location in the cell (they are currently secreted to the extracellular space), and verifying that our synthesis pathway is producing the quinones we are expecting.
We will be convening to plan the future of this project immediately after the conclusion of iGEM 2015. We will post updates and our plan on our website as they arise.
