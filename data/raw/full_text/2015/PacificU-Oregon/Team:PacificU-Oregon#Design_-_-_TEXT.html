Design
Our essential concept was a smart material that could react to orders given to it chemically by a computer. This would allow a symbiosis between machine and biology, enabling 3D printing, tunable properties based on architectural criteria, and speedy reaction times across a job site. We will continue developing this concept as time goes on.
