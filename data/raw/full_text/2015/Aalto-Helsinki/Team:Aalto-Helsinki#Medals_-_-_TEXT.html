Medal Criteria Checklist
Bronze Medal
✓ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
✓ Complete the Judging form .
✓ Create a Team Wiki.
✓ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✓ Attributions page
✓ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. Our Propane 1 BioBrick containing three of the enzymes needed for propane production can be found here .
Silver Medal
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. We have validated our GFP BioBrick with the methods described here .
✓ Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. The Registry Page of our GFP BioBrick
✓ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. Our human practices projects and outreach.
Gold Medal
✓ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative human practices activity that relates to your project. We created a report on interdisciplinarity in iGEM .
✓ Convince the judges you have helped any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem. We collaborated with Stockholm team with the iGEM cllaboration platform HumHub and helped to get their team started together with the 2014 Aalto-Helsinki team. More about the collaboration in our report .
X Improve the function OR characterization of an previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year of the iGEM competition) and enter this information in the Registry.
✓ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Our continuous production was shown to produce propane.
