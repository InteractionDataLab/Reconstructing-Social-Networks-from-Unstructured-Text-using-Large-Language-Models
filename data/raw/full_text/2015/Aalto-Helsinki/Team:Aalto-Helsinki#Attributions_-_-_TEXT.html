All the work not mentioned here was done by the students in the team. Most of the modeling and wet lab work was completed by the students, with help and guidance from people mentioned below. Wiki and website were created by the students with their previous knowledge and new skills learned during the summer. Aalto-Helsinki logo base was created by the previous year's team.
Our Supporters
Project support and advice
Our project is in large part based on two publications about propane production in E. coli.
Kallio et al. An engineered pathway for the biosynthesis of renewable propane.
Menon et al. A microbial platform for renewable propane synthesis based on a fermentative butanol pathway.
Professor Pauli Kallio and Dr. András Pásztor have provided us with valuable advice about the propane pathway and its construction.
Our amphiphilic proteins are derived from the study
Huber et al. Designer amphiphilic proteins as building blocks for the intracellular formation of organelle-like compartments.
Our advisor professor Markus Linder has given us valuable feedback on our ideas and general input on our development. Doctor Jussi Jäntti and other researchers from VTT gave help with expanding our idea and building our story.

Project advisor support
Markus Linder advised us throughout the project starting from ideation to presenting at the Giant Jamboree. He helped us get in contact with researchers who helped us in defining our project idea and gave us tips on labwork, modeling and funding. He also gave us feedback on our project throughout the summer and helped us refine our presentation and poster.
Heli Viskari helped us with practicalities in the lab and with lab orders. She also followed our project closely throughout the summer and gave feedback on our approaches and our presentations.
Human practices support
Tarja Knuuttila and her associates including Leena Tulkki, Rami Koskinen, Miles MacLeod, Tero Ijäs and Anita Välikangas from the University of Helsinki helped us create our idea and gave feedback and suggestions on the questions we chose for our human practices questionnaire. They also helped us analyze and gather our results as well as gave feedback on our report.
