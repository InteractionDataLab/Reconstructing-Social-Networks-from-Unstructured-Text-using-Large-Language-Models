We set out to create an interesting project, acquire friendships, learn new skills and most importantly, have fun.</P><P class="memberdescription">Our team is exceptionally interdisciplinary, with people from various fields and plenty of different skills gathered within. We were excited to see how far we can take our project this summer and how to combine all of our skills to produce the best results. While we divided ourselves to subgroups to organize the work load, many of us found ourselves swept away from the original plans to things we'd never imagined doing before. Our project kept expanding with our hunger to do even more and take everything out of our team and this summer.</P><P class="memberdescription">Here are the members of Aalto-Helsinki 2015, ready bring you the Fuel for the Future!</P></SECTION></DIV><SECTION id="members" class="active" data-anchor="members"><DIV class="row"><H1 style="text-align:center">Members</H1></DIV><DIV class="row vertical-align"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-md-7 member"><H2 class="membername">Annakarin Korppoo</H2><H3 class="memberstudy">Molecular Biosciences, University of Helsinki</H3><DIV class="memberparagraph"><H4 class="inlinetext">Why iGEM?</H4><P class="inlinetext"> A friend of mine was a part of Aalto-Helsinki 2014 team and she had a really great experience. When the application period for 2015 started, I figured I might as well try it out: iGEM is a unique project that let’s you get in touch with synthetic biology - something that is not widely studied or taught in the universities in Finland. I thought it would be a great first touch to the field.

Amidst the cool, shiny companies and slick spokespersons stood two figures: Members of the Aalto-Helsinki 2014 team. After describing what sounded like a perfect summer experience, they had the gall to say that the application period was open, and, well, the rest is history. Synthetic biology is not a subject I was familiar with when I applied to iGEM, but since my major is basically a patchwork of different sciences, I decided to apply. And what do you know, it seems I got accepted. At least no one has notified me of the possibility that I shouldn’t be here.</P></DIV><DIV class="memberparagraph"><H4 class="inlinetext">Describe yourself shortly.</H4><P class="inlinetext"> Male, 21 years of age, human-sized.

I saw a sticker of an Aalto-Helsinki bacterium during an event. I checked their web page, but the topic didn’t really fit in to my studies. However, the team got me excited about iGEM during a big University event. I didn’t have any more knowledge of synthetic biology than basics of biology from high school. I decided that this was a once in a lifetime chance and I can’t wait and the things I don’t know, I’ll learn.</P></DIV><DIV class="memberparagraph"><H4 class="inlinetext">Describe yourself shortly.</H4><P class="inlinetext"> I’m a 24-year old student from Aalto University.

I ran into my tutor (who was part of the first ever Aalto-Helsinki team) at a dinner party last autumn and his stories about “learning tons of new things” and “the best summer ever” made iGEM sound just the perfect way of spending a summer. So, when the application period finally started I rushed to write the most enthusiastic application I’ve ever made in my life and here I am now. I really feel that my biotechnology studies have been in a good use during the summer as I wanted, but working with our own, super interesting propane project has taught me more that I could have imagined at the beginning!</P></DIV><DIV class="memberparagraph"><H4 class="inlinetext">Describe yourself shortly.</H4><P class="inlinetext"> I’m a 23-year-old student from the University of Helsinki.

My quest was insatiable, and in 2013 I decided to start my bachelor’s degree in mathematics in Finland. This February, when I was 19, I finished my Bachelor of Science, and this semester I am coming back to work as a consultant in Brazil, where I expect to help solving big problems affecting the country.
