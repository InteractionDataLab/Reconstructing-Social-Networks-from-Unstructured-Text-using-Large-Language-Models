Protocols
You can find all of the protocols used in our project here as .pdf files. We based many of our protocols on what we found from research articles, openwetware.org, and other webpages. Some were given to us by 2014 Aalto-Helsinki team or researchers in Aalto University and VTT, the Techinical Research Center of Finland.

Kits
For plasmid extraction, we used both Termo Fisher Scientific's MiniPrep kit ( #K0691 ) and Macherey-Nagel's Plasmid Easy Pure kit ( 740727.250 ).
For PCR purification and gel extraction we used Thermo Fisher Scientific's kits ( #K0502 , #K0691 )
