ATTRIBUTIONS
BacPack to Mars
The digital application for BacPack to Mars was designed and implemented by Vivien Chen, Rachel Kwon, and Sam Mincheva with input from Johanna Okerlund, Lauren Westendorf, and advisor Orit Shaer. Jasmine Davis, Romie Litrell, Christina Pollalis, Anja Scholze, and Lily Westort were also heavily involved in the design process.  Members of the Wellesley/MIT Upward Bound Program and interns from the Framingham-Wellesley Summer Research Program interacted with early prototypes and gave useful feedback.  Larry Knowles provided training and helpful information for the laser cutting process.  Casey Grote designed and produced all art and images. The creative process was assisted by interns Melissa Foley, Nicole Nieves, and Priyanka Roy.
