MEDAL FULFILLMENT
The Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction Lab and the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose collaborated to create BacPack: an interactive museum exhibit that teaches fundamental Synthetic Biology concept in innovative ways. The exhibit features both a digital and a wet lab component that complement each other to convey basic principles of SynBio and raise awareness of the excitement and complexity of the field. BacPack users take on the role of a scientist and engineer bacteria that can help explorers on scientific missions in extreme environments, including Mars, Antarctica, and the Deep Sea.
