Basic Parts
Our parts are different recombineering markers and reporters. We have built two kill switches associated to different selection markers. Those are described in the team parts section . Since our team participates in the IGEM hardware track, our focus was mainly on developing a robotic platform and the number of biological parts we had a chance to create is more modest. However, each part is functional and ready to use! You will find in the table below the registry  links for each part as well as their general design.
