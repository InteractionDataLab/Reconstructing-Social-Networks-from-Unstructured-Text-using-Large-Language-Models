Being a team does not mean we do everything as a team. Actually, doing so would not be optimal. Being a team according to us is that everyone contributes in their own way, with their own set of skills and ideas to the project. In our case, our project is considerably voluminous. It has a few different modules, each with their own challenges: some electrical, some mechanical, some software and even some human oriented. Of course, we had help from our instructors and professors. With that in mind, this page is intended to attribute, for every person that contributed to our project, the work they have achieved to make this into a reality.
