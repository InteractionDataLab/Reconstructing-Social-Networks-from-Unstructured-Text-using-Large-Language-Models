MC96
A thermal experimentation has been the only experimentation done on the MC96 module.
 
Thermal experimentations results
Has no prototype has been built yet, the only results available are the ones from simulations.
Simulation Results
Some simulation has been done on earlier designs,     but none of the final design, due to the complexity of     simulating heat pipes. Thus, these results are not finals     and will surely improve with the addition of the heat pipes     between the Peltier elements and the 96-well aluminium mold.
The following figures represent the repartition of heat at     the beginning and the end of a heating speed test:

After December 2015, new modules are planned. These are the ideas for new modules.
Modules Planned

Pump for greater liquid volume (over 1ml)
Vacuum for spin column-based nucleic acid purification
Incubator with temperature and C02 control
These modules could be realized by a new team of the University of Sherbrooke.
Some chemists have shown interest in the platform and its modules.   Adaptation of those modules for chemistry could also be a possible   avenue for further development
