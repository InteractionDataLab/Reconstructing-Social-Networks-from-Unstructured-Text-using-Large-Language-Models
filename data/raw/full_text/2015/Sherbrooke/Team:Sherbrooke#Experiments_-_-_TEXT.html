See Results   Theoretical method to determine the optimised cooling voltage
This method is an iterative method that is used to approximate the voltage   to apply to the Peltier element to cool the aluminium mold.
Logically the more power applied to the Peltier element   the more power is removes from the aluminium mold, thus   increasing its cooling speed. However, the power to disperse   by the heat sink is too high, so the hot side of the Peltier element   is so hot that the temperature difference between the hot side and the   cool side is not enough to reach 0℃.
The following figure, from the Peltier element datasheet ,  shows the relation between the power to dissipate by the heat sink   versus the temperature difference between the hot side and cold side (ΔT).
Peltier element Waste Heat vs ΔT
On the following graph, a ΔT is set to 60℃ and the voltage to 24.4V,  thus giving 190W to dissipate.
The following equation gives the hot side temperature giving these parameters:
th = tamb + Qh * Rheat sink
th = Hot side temperature (℃) tamb = Ambient temperature (℃) Qh = Power to dissipate (W) Rheat sink = Thermal resistance of the heat sink (℃/W)
The heat sink thermal resistance have been tested and characterized   at 0.22℃/W and the ambient temperature to 22℃, thus, giving a hot   side temperature of 63.8℃. By subtracting the set ΔT to this result,  a temperature of 3.8℃ is obtained on the cool side. This is over the   specification of 0℃.
So, another iteration of the method with a lower voltage and ΔT is necessary.
After a couple of iterations, the voltage of 15.5V and the ΔT of 40℃ have given  the specification of 0℃.
