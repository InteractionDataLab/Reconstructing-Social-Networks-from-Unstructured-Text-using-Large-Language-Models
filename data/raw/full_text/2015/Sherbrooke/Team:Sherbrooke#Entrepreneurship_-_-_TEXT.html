It is a known fact that there are already existing companies operating in the robotic laboratory platform design.  However, those types of platforms are generally designed for high volume applications in order to repeat the same operation hundreds, if not thousands of times.  We rather believe that it’s possible to develop an « assistant type » robotic platform, who would replace human involvement in the execution of the majority of protocols executed, mainly those needing low thinking process and demand a significant amount of time for the professionals.  The robotic platform available on the market are fairly expensive and have a non-negligible maintenance and operational cost. We are targeting of producing and commercializing robotic platforms at low costs, whether in the $30K to $50K range, and which the consumable equipment is as affordable as the equipment currently used by most laboratories.  This is what distinguishes our robotic platform from other products available by mainstream companies.
