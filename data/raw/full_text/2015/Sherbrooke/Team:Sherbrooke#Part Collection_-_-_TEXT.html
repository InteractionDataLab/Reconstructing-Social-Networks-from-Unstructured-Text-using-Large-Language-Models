Parts Collection
Our parts collection is composed of different recombineering markers and reporters. We have built two kill switches and a double positive selection markers module. Those are described in the team parts section . Since our team participates to IGEM in the hardware track, the parts collection is not much developed. But each part is functional and ready to use!
