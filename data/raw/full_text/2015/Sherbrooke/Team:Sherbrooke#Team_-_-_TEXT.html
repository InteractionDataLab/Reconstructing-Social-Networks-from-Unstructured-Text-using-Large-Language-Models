Our team
Our team is located at the University of Sherbrooke, in the province of Québec in Canada, and formed of students and instructors from various fields of expertise: electrical engineering, software engineering, molecular biology and microbiology. The multidisciplinary nature of our team has allowed us to create a complete laboratory automation platform comprising hardware, software, and wetware.
The students taking part in this team are attending their final year of college. However, only a few of those are actually born and raised from Sherbrooke and its surroundings.  The team members originate from different regions and demographics throughout the province. The diverse and varied minds and ways of working from everyone came together as a whole as every member weighed in with their contribution, to achieve a shared vision on what the robotic platform should be. The team's representatives are all interestsed in common subjects such as biology, engineering and robotics. The iGEM competition is seen as a great and interestsing challenge.
