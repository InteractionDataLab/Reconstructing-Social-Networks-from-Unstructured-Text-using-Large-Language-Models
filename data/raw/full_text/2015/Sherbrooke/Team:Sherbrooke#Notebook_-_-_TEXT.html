To ease project management, the BIOBOT team was separated in two distinct team called Instrumentation and Mechatronix. BIOBOT - Instrumentation was in charge of the TAC, MC1.5, MC96 and controller interface. BIOBOT - Mechatronix was in charge of the robotic platform, tool holder, pipettes handlers, centrifuge and BananaBoard. Here is a calendar of the work achieved, objectives fulfilled and problems encountered for both team, through each week from the beginning of the project. Although the whole team was subdivided as two entities, some of the work needed to be, and was, executed as a whole.
