The UFMG_Brazil iGEM team was responsible for nearly all aspects of the project. We are thankful we could put up an amazing and diverse team that could make this happen. Every single member worked hard and was committed from the beginning to the very last minute to the iGEM rollercoaster experience. We are the pioneers in Synthetic Biology in our University, for what we are really proud. It is a big challenge and we are still learning. Here is what each one of us has done for the project (in addition of having a great time!).

Acknowledgments
First of all, we would like to thank our team members’ instructors for supporting their student’s participation on this competition. Prof. Erika Cristina Jorge, Prof. Antero Ribeiro and M.Sc. Josiely Gomes, Prof. Daniella Bartolomeu, Prof. Simone Gonçalves.
We thank all the partner laboratories for allowing us to use their infrastructure, donating reagents, exchanging knowledge, loving biology as much as we do and for getting on board with our crazy SynBio project:
Laboratório de Biologia Sintética e Biomiméticos (ICB-UFMG)
Laboratório de Biologia Oral e do Desenvolvimento (ICB-UFMG)
Laboratório de Microbiologia Oral e Anaeróbios (ICB-UFMG)
Laboratório de Imunologia e Genômica de Parasitos (ICB-UFMG), specially Prof. Ricardo Toshio Fujiwara and Prof. Daniella Castanheira Bartholomeu
Centro de Desenvolvimento da Tecnologia Nuclear (CDTN-UFMG) and the Faculdade de Farmácia da UFMG, for making the Biodistribution test possible. Specially Prof. Antero Andrade and Prof. André Barros.
Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), for cultivating the Centrin-1-/- Leishmania donovani strain on their NB-2 lab
We also thank Professor Flávio Almeida Amaral, for enlightening the inflammatory responses process related to rheumatoid arthritis to us, as well as exchanging ideas on how to test our devices in vivo.
Last but certainly not least, we would like to thank from the bottom of our hearts all the 56 crowdfunding donors that helped our team get to Boston! You are awesome!
Benfeitoria crowdfunding donnors
Put your mics up and come to leishoke
All the Leishmanias (Put a plasmid on it)
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
Now put your mice up
Up in the lab, we just collapsed
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to knockdown
but now you wanna KO
Cuz we noticed another allele
For my crowdfunding I needed donation
Ya could have paid my subscription
Cried my tears, for all these months
Ya could’ve sent cash for me
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
I got macrophages for arthrits, Leishmanias in the knees
Hold anti inflammatory MΦ activated
timing up, sent my notebook
I wanted to have treated more your arthritis
I need no permission, did I mention
ANVISA didn't pay any attention
Cuz we received an invoice
Late you released my biobricks
I know what it really feels like to miss time
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Don't treat to these things of this contest
I'm not that kind of scientist
Gold medal is what I prefer, what I deserve
To Boston this plane takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into Jamboree
Say I'm not the one who has not won
If I don't win, I won’t cry alone
All my team will help me
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
Now put your mice up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
