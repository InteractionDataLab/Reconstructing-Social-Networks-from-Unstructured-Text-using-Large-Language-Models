All the Leishmanias (Put a plasmid on it)
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
Now put your mice up
Up in the lab, we just collapsed
I'm doing my own little thing
Decided to knockdown
but now you wanna KO
Cuz we noticed another allele
For my crowdfunding I needed donation
Ya could have paid my subscription
Cried my tears, for all these months
Ya could’ve sent cash for me
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
I got macrophages for arthrits, Leishmanias in the knees
Hold anti inflammatory MΦ activated
timing up, sent my notebook
I wanted to have treated more your arthritis
I need no permission, did I mention
ANVISA didn't pay any attention
Cuz we received an invoice
Late you released my biobricks
I know what it really feels like to miss time
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Don't treat to these things of this contest
I'm not that kind of scientist
Gold medal is what I prefer, what I deserve
To Boston this plane takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into Jamboree
Say I'm not the one who has not won
If I don't win, I won’t cry alone
All my team will help me
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
All the Leishmanias
Now put your mice up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh operon
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Cuz if you wanna insert a gene then you put a plasmid on it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
Don't forget LAP and agg if you wanna treat it
If you wanna express IFN-β then you put a plasmid on it
