Safety form submitted. The kill switch had too many problems to be synthesized, so we chose to synthesize just the INF-ß construction for now.</LI></UL><LI><STRONG>July:</STRONG></LI><UL><LI>Week 27: Public survey for Synenergene in several locations in the city of Belo Horizonte. Begin of the InterLab experiments with the expansion of XL1-blue and BL-21 bacteria. Advertising our SynBio Workshop, which will happen on August 5th. Team advisor Tiago Mendes was interviewed by <A href="https://www.ufmg.br/online/radio/arquivos/anexos/TIAGO%20MENDES%20-%20IGEM%20UFMG%20-%2029-06-2015.mp3">Rádio UFMG</A>about iGEM and our project.</LI><LI>Week 28: Further work on the organization of the SynBio Workshop, including buying airplane tickets and booking hotel rooms for the speakers from São Paulo. Synenergene text alterations and addition of more details. Our team received an invitation to give a lecture at UnB (Brasília’s University) in october, about synbio and the iGEM. Jamboré participation via Skype. InterLab experiments are going wrong, as we are facing an antibiotic problem. To solve that, we will buy new antibiotics and restart the experiments. Last Idea Incubator class before vacations, we will return in early August, when classes return.</LI><LI>Week 29: Giant Jamboree registration of 3 team members. Further advertisement of our SynBio Workshop. Synenergene text modifications. Meeting to create a text-delivery schedule for the wiki. InterLab: antibiotics problem solved, new bacteria produced.

IDT genes arrived, so we planned the project’s experiments.</LI></UL><LI><STRONG>August:</STRONG></LI><UL><LI>Week 31: Collaboration with Aix-Marseille team by answering their survey. UFMG’s techno-administration employees are on strike, therefore the semester’s registration is suspended, as well as every class, postponing the Idea Incubator’s return. SynBio workshop happened this week, and it was a total success! Professor and instructor Liza Felicori was interviewed by the newspaper <A href="http://www.otempo.com.br/interessa/ci%C3%AAncia-usa-biologia-sint%C3%A9tica-para-criar-m%C3%A1quinas-org%C3%A2nicas-1.1080197">“O Tempo”</A>, and the article got the front page! Bacterial expansion of the plasmid containing IFN-ß and further clone miniprep.</LI><LI>Week 32: Kelly Drinkwater asked us to better explain some safety aspects of our project and update the “About Our Project” text on iGEM’s website. The synthesized primers arrived, so we could continue the experiments. Amplification of the IFN-ß biobrick by PCR, followed by its digestion and binding to pGEM and pSB1C3 plasmids. InterLab: successful cloning of the P1-22A; P1-22K; P1-20K and P4-21J promoters. That was necessary due to the low amount of biobricks sample. Replacing the modelling with real data, adding clearance, phagocytosis and half-life of macrophages and <I>Leishmania</I>. Starting to come up with the Giant Jamboree’s presentation. Wiki design and content meeting. Synenergene meeting to improve project’s aspects and survey.</LI><LI>Week 33: Wiki’s animation sketch in progress; texts starting to be written. Modelling data were optimized, plotting for wiki. Scheduling technetium <I>Leishmania</I> staining (to determine its spreading pattern on mice) with collaborator. Scheduling interview with RA patients for Human Practices. Writing Techno-moral Scenarios for Synenergene.</LI><LI>Week 34: Idea Incubator’s return. Our InterLab experiments went completely wrong: we had a major setback because of the Brazilian import policy, and the biobricks only arrived in July; also, we spent a lot of time standardizing the protocols, the bacteria did not glow as it should, and the limited amount of DNA made it hard to transform the biobricks. Problems in cloning IFN-ß as well. Interview with RA patients was made.</LI></UL><LI><STRONG>September:</STRONG></LI><UL><LI>Week 35: Definition of the topics to be discussed in the presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Problems in cloning IFN-ß were solved. Establishing protocols for technetium <I>Leishmania</I> staining. Defining a practical action to inform the society about our project.</LI><LI>Week 36: Discussing presentation for Giant Jamboree. Requesting an interview with rheumatologist specialist doctor about arthritis.</LI><LI>Week 37: Discussing presentation for Giant Jamboree. We went to the streets of Belo Horizonte to promote synthetic biology and our project for society.</LI><LI>Week 38: Social action LeishMania at Praça da Liberdade (Portuguese form for Liberty Square), Belo Horizonte. We took a glove which simulates RA symptoms to sensitize society about how limited are the joints of patients affected by this disease. Also, we collected people’s opinions on the acceptance of the use of our chassis to treat RA and asked for their ideas on how science could make the world better.
