Participating in iGEM is both an exciting experience and a huge financial challenge for us, particularly this year. Brazil is facing a financial crisis, and there were several moments on which we thought we would not be able to pay for our research, let alone the travel expenses... But, as the saying goes, we are Brazilians and we never give up! After a lot of hard work, we got the money we needed to participate, and we are all very proud to represent our University, Brazil and Latin America in Boston! We would like to thank all of our sponsors for their support and for believing in us!
We would also to like to thank everybody that contributed with our crowfunding in Benfeitoria
