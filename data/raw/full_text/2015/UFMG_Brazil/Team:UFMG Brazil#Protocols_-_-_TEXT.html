PCR for IFN-β amplification
PCR reaction
3 μl incubation buffer
3 μl primer F
3 μl primer R
1 μl INF-β plasmidial DNA (“pUCIDT gene 1-LAP-INFB”)
3 μl dNTP (10x diluted)
17 μl H2O
0.5 μl Taq DNA Polymerase
Thermocycler program:
Agarose DNA electrophoresis gel
Gel materials – 30 mL gel 1.2%
0.36 g agarose
30 mL TAE Buffer (tris-acetate-EDTA)
1.5 µL Sybr Safe
TAE Buffer materials – 1L
242 g Tris Base
57.1 mL Cold Acetic Acid
100 mL 0.5 M EDTA
1 L distilled water
Sample materials - 12 µL
1 kb DNA ladder
10 µL DNA samples:
8 µL nuclease-free water
2 µL Miniprep DNA
2 µL loading buffer
Methodology
Prepare the TAE buffer joining the materials in a volumetric flask, beaker or container at the stated order.
Add the agarose and TAE in Erlenmeyer. Mix and heat it carefully in the microwave until homogeneous and without crystals.
Wait the glass cooling until the temperature reaches ~60° C. Add Syber Safe and pour the solution in the appropriate gel-forming container. Insert the comb to form the wells and wait for gel solidification.
Remove the comb, place the gel on the running cube, and immerse gel in TAE.
In a microtube or paraplast tape, mix the loading buffer with the DNA and carefully apply it to the gel. Apply the 1 kb DNA Ladder to gel as well.
Plug the electrodes and run gel for ~40 min.
Double digestion
Double digestion reaction:
4.8 μl Nuclease-free water
12 μl pLP-neo miniprep DNA
0.2 μl BSA
2 μl Multicore 10x buffer
0.5 μl XbaI enzyme
0.5 μl BamHI enzyme
Final volume: 20 μl
Quick spin
Incubation at 37º C for 3 h
Inactivation at 56º C for 30 min
Ligation
We used the IFN-β DNA amplified by PCR for ligation with pGEM-T Easy vector System I (Promega).
Reaction - total 10 μl
5 μl 2x Rapid Ligation Buffer, T4 DNA Ligase
1 μl pGEM-T Easy vector (50 ng)
3 μl IFN-β PCR product from tube 1
1 μl T4 DNA Ligase (3 Weiss units/μl)
Incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After, the ligation was incubated at 4° C, overnight.

TOP10 E.coli bacteria chemo competent transformation
2 μl of pUCIDT gene 1-LAP-INFβ plasmid in 100 μl of TOP10 bacteria
30 min ice incubation
90 s incubation in 42º C water bath;

Bacterial plating
Materials used
Erlenmeyer flask and sterilized becker
LB Agar
Sterile petri dishes
Antibiotic
Bunsen burner
70% Ethanol
Platinum strap
Clones
Methods
Heat LB Agar in the microwave. Let it cool near the flame.
Pour between 15 mL and 30 mL of LB Agar in an Erlenmeyer. Add the antibiotic in the right proportion and mix.
Pour the medium in the Petri dish and let it solidify near the flame.
Pipet the desired volume of clone on the plate. Spread the bacterial suspension throughout the Petri dish homogeneously.
Cover the plate and incubate it at 37° C for 12-16 h
Standard antibiotics concentration used:
Ampicillin: 10 µl/ml

Sterilized test-tubes
LB Liquid medium
Bunsen burner
Methodology
Add 4 ml of LB liquid medium to each test-tube and the correspondent antibiotic ratio
With toothpick or sterilized tip, remove an isolated colony
Place the toothpick/tip inside the test-tube, without touching it sides
Leave the tubes overnight at 37° C for 16 h in the shaker
After incubation, remove the tubes from the shaker. Medium must be turbid, indicating bacterial growth
Pour the contents of the test-tubes on a larger recipient and complete volume to 20 ml with liquid LB medium
Repeat the incubation as above and remove the inserted plasmid through miniprep or maxiprep
