Synenergene
As our team was chosen to develop a human practices project with a Synenergene partnership, we were sponsored by the Rathenau Instituut and mentored directly by the University of Bergen. We are very grateful for the opportunity of working with such institutions. We have learned a lot. We would like to specially thank Mr. Kjetil Rommetveit from the University of Bergen, our mentor, for helping us develop our project, for the always-relevant suggestions and guidance.
Aix-Marseille
Our team answered Team Aix-Marseille’s “Chewing-gum Survey”, and for the help we have earned their Silver Medal!
