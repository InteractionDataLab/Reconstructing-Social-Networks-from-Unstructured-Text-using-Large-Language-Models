SYNENERGENE
The team has worked in the project’s Policy & Practices in collaboration with SYNENERGENE, a large European network of partner institutions aiming at Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in synthetic biology. A grant-funded collaboration was mediated by Synenergene’s partner, the Rathenau Institut, between UFMG_Brazil team and the University of Bergen.
In the partnership, the hard impacts of the project’s applications have been explored and discussed aiming to develop the Application Scenarios. Using the Application Scenarios, we discussed the soft impacts and therefore investigated the desirability of our application in what was called Techno-moral Scenarios.
What is Synenergene?
SYNENERGENE is a four-years mobilization and mutual learning action plan supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme. The project aims to contribute to Responsible Research and Innovation in synthetic biology by establishing an open dialogue between stakeholders concerning synbio’s potential benefits and risks, and by exploring possibilities for its collaborative shaping on the basis of public participation.
