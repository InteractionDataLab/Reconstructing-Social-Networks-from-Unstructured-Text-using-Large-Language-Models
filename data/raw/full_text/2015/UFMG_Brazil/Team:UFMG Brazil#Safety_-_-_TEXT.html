Safety
The main issue related with safety is that the wild type of our chassis is pathogenic, responsible for causing leishmaniasis. However, we are using an attenuated Leishmania donovani strain, the L. donovani Cen1-/-, which is deficient for the gene of Centrin-1 and was described by Selvapandiyan et al. (2004). Moreover, the virulence reduction of this Leishmania strain has been evaluated and confirmed with different animal models, such as mice (Selvapandiyan et al., 2006), hamsters (Selvapandiyan et al., 2009) and dogs (Fiuza et al., 2014). Besides, human macrophage infection by this strain has also been proved to be reduced in vitro (Selvapandiyan et al., 2004).
Our goal is to use this Leishmania chassis as an in situ drug delivery system to macrophages. Although they should be safe to human, environmental damage could still happen if these GMOs were to leak into the wilderness after a sandfly took a blood meal on an undergoing treatment patient. To prevent that, we designed a kill switch to eliminate promastigote modified Leishmania outside the lab.   The execution of the project is of low risk to our team during lab phase. Besides the fact that the strain is attenuated, our lab is equipped with level 2 biosafety requirements, containing all the proper security equipments. Even if an accidental infection occurs, the medicine recommended for Leishmania infection, named Glucantime (Aventis), is also available in our lab and can cure leishmaniasis in 20 days.
We foresee some problems with using a parasite to treat inflammation-related diseases, such as that the host-parasite interaction could increase the inflammatory process in high responsive people, and also the possibility of the strain to reacquire virulence factors. On this last topic, however, the probability should be very low, since this attenuated strain has remained stable for several years. Another case would be if the modified Leishmania were lose the ability to express IFN-β, which would lead to treatment failure. To solve theses problems, exhaustive analysis of a model should be performed, stability analysis of IFN-β production should be tested in laboratory and high-quality control protocols for confirmation of non-pathogenicity potential should be developed and validated.
