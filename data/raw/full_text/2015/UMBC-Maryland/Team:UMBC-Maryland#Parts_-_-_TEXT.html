For our project, we ordered 3 G Blocks from IDT that we assembled into plasmids using NEB HiFi Assembly. These 3 assembled plasmids will be submitted as composite parts to the iGEM registry, each containing a promoter, RBS, and gene. For all of the parts we made, we used the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and the RBS BBa_B0034 .
The first G block and composite part we made is the CUP1 gene from S. cerevisiae (NCBI ID 856450 ) with the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and the RBS BBa_B0034 . The composite part for this promoter, RBS, and gene is BBa_K1811777 . The documented basic registry part for the CUP1 gene is BBa_M45090 .
The second G block and composite part we made is the CUP1 gene from S. cerevisiae that has been codon optimized for E. coli tRNA abundance. This codon optimized CUP1 gene is listed as a basic part with number BBa_K1811222 . The composite part with the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and the RBS BBa_B0034 is BBa_K1811888 .
The third G block and composite part we made is the codon optimized CUP1 gene from S. cerevisiae fused with the LamB gene from E. coli. LamB is a gene that codes for an outer membrane transport channel that transports maltose and maltodextrins. LamB is also the receptor for phage lambda. We removed the stop codon of CUP1 and inserted its sequence into amino acid position 153 of LamB. The basic part for this gene fusion is BBa_K1811333 . The composite part with the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 and the RBS BBa_B0034 is BBa_K1811666 .
