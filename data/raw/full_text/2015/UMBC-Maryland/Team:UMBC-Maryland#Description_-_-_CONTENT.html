When copper is oxidized from Cu+ to 

Cu2+, it often produces a free radical known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is capable of 

severely damaging any biological molecules it comes into contact with.  This damage at the molecular 

level has been linked to diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Prion diseases.

E. coli have been engineered to have increased copper uptake; however, due to the toxicity of copper, 

the E. coli quickly saturate and are unable to uptake any more copper. Our goal is to increase the 

efficiency of copper uptake in E. coli for the purpose of bioremediation in fresh water ecosystems. We 

plan on doing this by increasing our engineered cells' resistance to copper toxicity as well as increasing 

their ability to uptake copper. </P><P>In order to make engineered cells more resistant to copper toxicity, we will be genetically engineering E. 

coli with enhanced copper tolerance by giving it a gene for yeast metallothionein. This protein will bind 

11 copper atoms, making them less reactive and less toxic. This protein is also an antioxidant that can 

detoxify hydroxyl radicals with its cysteine groups.</P><P>We plan on creating three separate cell lines that contain a metallothionein gene in different forms. One 

is the yeast metallothionein CUP1 gene directly transformed into E. coli. A second is the CUP1 gene 

codon optimized for E. coli. The third is metallothionein that will adhere to the outer membrane of E. 

coli. This will be done by fusing the CUP1 gene sequence into the lamB transport channel. This will cause 

metallothionein to adhere to the outer surface of E. coli by being bound to one of E. coliâ€™s outer 

membrane transporters. This should ideally allow engineered cells to be able to sequester copper 

without getting as much inside, making copper less toxic to them.</P><P>Future efforts to bring this project to its complete application in polluted waters will include several 

additional genes. Superoxide dismutase and catalase are integral antioxidant proteins that are key to 

radical scavenging. Without them, ROS will continue to cause cell damage as quickly as heavy metals like 

copper will produce ROS.  Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide ROS molecules into hydrogren 

peroxide. Catalse converts hydrogen peroxide into water. In addition to these antioxidants, a buoyancy 

gene under the control of a copper sensitive promoter can be utilized to gather and collect engineered 

cells. The use of these combined tools will aid in the harvesting of heavy metals such as copper from 

polluted waters.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
