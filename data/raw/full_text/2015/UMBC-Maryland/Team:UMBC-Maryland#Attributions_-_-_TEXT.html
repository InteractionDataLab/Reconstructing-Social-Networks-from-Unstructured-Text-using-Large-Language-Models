General Support
Dr. Cynthia Wagner is a Senior Lecturer in Biological Sciences at UMBC. She is also our mentor and aided us during our experiments, brainstorming, and founded the first UMBC iGEM Team.
Dr. Stephen Freeland, the Director of Interdisciplinary Studies became our advisor and helped in the foundation of UMBCâ€™s first iGEM Team.
We would also like to acknowledge the iGEM Team from the University of Groningen, Netherlands for their project idea in 2009. Their work on the import of arsenite and arsenate by GlpF inspired us to do so for copper.
Financial Support
The UMBC Student Government Association provided us with funds for travel cost and reagent cost.
Mrs. Felicia Felton, the Assistant Director of Annual Giving at UMBC, helped us jumpstart our crowdfunding website.
We would also like to thank the Department of Biological Sciences, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Interdisciplinary Studies, Honors College and the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences at UMBC for their support.
Lab Support
Ralph Murphy, Teaching Lab Technician, provided sterilized flasks of Lysogeny Broth for the inoculation experiments.
Lab space is provided by the Department of Biological Sciences.
Advisory Support
Professor Lisa Kelly, a Senior Lecturer in Chemistry and Biochemistry at UMBC, informed us about how we can measure copper and also taught us the role of reactive oxygen species.
Julie Wolf, Senior Lecturer in Biological Sciences at UMBC, taught us how to do Hi-Fi Assembly.
Professor Elsa Garcin, a Senior Lecturer in Chemistry and Biochemistry at UMBC, helped us decide which protein to select for our project.
Dr. Herald Schrier, a Senior Lecturer in Biological Sciences at UMBC, taught us surface binding.
Copper Measurement Support
Dr. Stephen Mang is a Senior Lecturer in Chemistry and Biochemistry at UMBC. With his advice, we learned how to do flame atomic absorption spectroscopy through the use the spectrometer in his lab.
Dr. Zeev Rosenzweig is a professor and the  Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UMBC. Through his advice, we discovered a method to quantify copper through fluorescence.
Dr. Suzanne Ostrand-Rosenberg, a professor in Biological Sciences at UMBC, and graduate student Lucas Horn, allowed us to use the plate reader in her lab to measure copper.
