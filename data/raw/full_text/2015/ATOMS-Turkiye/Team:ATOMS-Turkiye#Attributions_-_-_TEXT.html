ATTRIBUTION
Team: The ATOMS iGEM team consists of a group of medical students, who are excited about Genetics and Bioengineering and determined to create influencing projects in the iGEM competition and field of Genetics. On this page, we want to introduce you to everyone, who has contributed to the project.
 
We would like to sincerely thank you to all our advisors and to all people, who has helped us to realise our project, especially to our rector Prof. Dr. Abdulkadir Sengun (Prof. Dr.Abdulkadir Sengun), Prof. Dr. Mehmet Gunduz (Prof.Dr. Mehmet Gündüz) and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Esra Gunduz (Assoc. Prof. Dr. Esra Gunduz), the board of trustees and great support of our university, so without their assistance and help throughout this difficult time, our project would not have been possible. Last but not least, we want to thank to our advisors Ayse Celik and Mustafa Elitok for their all kind support and helps. They showed a lot of patience and understanding during our busy times, motivated us no matter what happened and always reminded us of our set goals. Without these important people accompanying us, a joyful iGEM duration would not have be thinkable.

Collaboration
This year, we have carried out several collabrations with other iGEM teams.
 
As a Health and Medicine team we have contacted the UCL iGEM team and had a quite interesting conversation about the difficulty and our experiences of presenting a Health and Medicine project, especially at safety and ethics section of the project. After asking questions about their aspects of safety&ethics, we mentioned our way to outgo these problems: With the creating of a platform, called as Virtual Hospital, where we can be more imaginary and feel like our projects can be applied to today's medical approaches. (Visit 'Human Practise' to learn more about the Virtual Hospital). The UCL iGEM team acceptet this suggestion and mentioned, that they want to join our virtual hospital.
 
Also we mentored the AUC Turkey iGEM High School team this year and guided them during their experiments to increase their possibility of achieving their set goals.
 
Additionally, we have carried out an iGEM Rhizi Collaboration with iGEM Paris Bettencourt, were our team is getting connected to other iGEM teams with same communalities and were we got a badge for participating in their iGEM Rhizi.
