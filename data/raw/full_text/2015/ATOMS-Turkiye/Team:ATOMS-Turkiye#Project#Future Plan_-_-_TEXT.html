FUTURE
Future Plan
In our project, we have expected to resolve gastric ulcer disease and gastric cancer. We have told that the virulence of pathogenic bacteria Helicobacter   pylori occurs gastric ulcer. Also we have told Gastric cancer is the uncontrolled   cell division and cumulative results of genetic mutations in this region. We have   aimed in our project eradication with Acid resistance, flagella expedite,   chemotaxis to h.pylori with sensing Al2 and NH3, DAMP-Pexiganan produce and   Pexiganan activator TEV Protease features(modifications) added E.coli. In our   gastric cancer module we have expected hBAX apoptotic protein production in   cancer cells within sensing excessive increased and decreased microRNA levels   ,if we compare with normal cells, and matching right cancer situation profile   with our genetic circuit detection system. So our expectation was create the   target-driven chemotherapy treatment that do not damaging normal cells and   kill target cancer cells efficiency. In case of these, in these methods performing   synthetic biology have a substantial role. But we can not ignore present's some   problems beside that situation. Some of these are gene therapy's level of   security, deprivation of medication etc. In addition to these problems there are   some necessaries what support we have to do this, if we set an exemple; At the   present, tetra-medication method is using for ulcer treatment. And these four   drugs' three of them are antibiotics to kill helicobacter pylori. But in the future   antibiotic resistance may develop in h.pylori to these antibiotics. Consequently   tetra-medication method usebility may be hard at the future. Unfortunately,   about cancer there are not any advenced clear treatment at the present. So that   at the future time we will benefit from synthetic biology without pass by safety   and ethic problems for eleminating these all of the problems. Nowadays we   expect our developed treatment methods will rank as modern treatment   methods if we do not encounter a problem.  Our treatment will be done with three stages;
1)Diagnosis and recognition  People who have gastric diseases will diagnose with routin ways or more   sensitive effective ways which may discover at the future. After the diagnosis of   cancer or stomach ulcer in patients our treatment methods will performed. Our   curative E.coli will given in a capsule as like a drug. Or our genetic circuit will   given in liposomes or exosomes by intraveneous way.
2)Monitoring treatment developing  Inferentially one week later from our treatments' using. Patients' recovery   amount will detect with a contol testing like stomach screening. To redetermine   treatment dosage and treatment's continue or not this part is necessary.   Especially for cancer module this part is very important. Because treatment   length will change within these treatment screening and monitoring.
3)Being finished of treatment  Treatment will be terminated if it is complately heal would detect after the   controlls at regular intervals to the patient. But before leaving the patient's   treatment use, you must go to the doctor for a final time check whether to learn   are there is any risk factor beside. After this phase we will conclude that the   patient is now healed. Also at the future ethics also can be encountered any   problems in areas such as like as safety subjects. In this case, used treatment may   have to be revised again according to the conditions of time.
