Special thanks to
We would like to sincerely thank to all our advisors and to all people, who has helped us to realize our project, especially to our rector Prof. Dr. Abdulkadir Sengun, our dean Prof. Dr. Mehmet Gunduz and our instructor Prof. Dr. Esra Gunduz, the board of trustees and great support of our university, so without their assistance and help throughout this difficult time, our project would not have been possible. Last but not least, we want to thank to our advisor Ayse Celik for her all kind support and helps. She showed a lot of patience and understanding during our busy times, motivated us no matter what happened and always reminded us of our set goals. Without these important people accompanying us, a joyful iGEM duration would not be possible.
