Project Description
This year, our teamâ€™s main goal is to cure the gastric ulcer and the cancer. Gastric ulcer is caused mainly by Helicobacter pylori. This bacteria is a gram-negative bacteria that effects more than 50% of human population.  As a health and medicine team of medical students, we decided to eradicate H. pylori because it causes ulcer and maybe gastric cancer in next stages but these diseases can not cured completely with the recent treatments. In design of our project, we had 2 different modules, which have submodules under them. First module is eradication of the H. pylori and second module is a switch system to cure cancer. For eradication of H. pylori (Module I), we decided to modify E. coli to produce Pexiganan (an antimicrobial peptide which can kill H. pylori) and having acid resistant and make its flagella faster for penetration,  To cure the cancer (Module II); we designed switch systems which are based on differences of miRNA concentration between normal cells and cancer cells. We have two different switch systems, miRNA level dependent system and independent system. After many researches we found out that miRNA levels and their variety can be really useful to classify cells as normal and cancer cells. Our system is designed to sense the levels of miRNAs, which are down-regulated or up-regulated in cancer cells, and start to apoptosis process.
