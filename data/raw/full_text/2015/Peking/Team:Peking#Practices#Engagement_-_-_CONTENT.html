However, the awareness rates of the diagnosis methods, the specific treatment methods and the national prevention and control policy of tuberculosis are less than 40%. As for the part of cognitive attitude of synthetic biology, only 6.2% of the tourists have a deeper understanding of synthetic biology, while 33.3% of the respondents have never heard of synthetic biology. The awareness rates of the selected terms about the field of synthetic biology are generally lower than 35%, of which 58.1% and 52.8% of the tourists have access to relevant knowledge through the Internet and television, respectively. 76% of the tourists agree that applying synthetic biology methods to clinical diagnosis is feasible, and 86% of the visitors are willing to use the relevant technology products if possible, the main reasons of which are rapidness, individuation and the reliable results of the new detection technology.

The majority of the population of the survey has a neutral attitude towards synthetic biology, and most of them are optimistic about the applications and progress of synthetic biology, though only a small portion of people knows this field very well. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the popularization of the knowledge of tuberculosis in public. The process of propaganda to the national for health education of tuberculosis should not be a slogan, and it should be in-depth and systematic. On the other hand, researchers in the field of synthetic biology should actively work for the science popularization of synthetic biology at the same time they are working for the scientific research. They are responsible for improving the people’s understanding of the synthetic biology, and attracting more people to join the development trend of synthetic biology.
