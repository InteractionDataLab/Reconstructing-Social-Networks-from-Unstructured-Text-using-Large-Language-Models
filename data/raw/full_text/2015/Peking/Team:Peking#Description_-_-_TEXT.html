Nluc-dCas9 fusion protein
(BBa_K1689010)
Nluc was fused to the N terminus of dCas9 to form the Nluc-dCas9   fusion protein. It is used to bind a DNA sequence guided by sgRNA. Paired with   Cluc-dCas9 fusion protein (BBa_K1689009) and sgRNAs,   our paired dCas9 reporter system were constructed.
Cluc-dCas9 fusion protein
(BBa_K1689009)
Cluc was fused to the N terminus of dCas9 to form the Cluc-dCas9   fusion protein. It is used to bind a DNA sequence guided by sgRNA. Paired with   Nluc-dCas9 fusion protein (BBa_K1689010) and sgRNAs,   our paired dCas9 reporter system were constructed.
sgRNA generator
(BBa_K1689000)
sgRNA generator is used for generating sgRNA which recognizes   targeted DNA, then guiding dCas9 to it.

Part   Collection
2015 Peking iGEM has not only transformed the sequence   information into detectable bioluminescence, but also explore a wide range in which   Paired dCas9 (PC) Reporter System is able to be applied. Since we have chosen split   enzyme as our reporter, it can be substituted by various kinds of enzymes, thus the    form of read-out will be abundant at the same time. That is, our PC reporter system   has successfully provided a platform to produce a variety of signals.
We combine the specific sequence binding activity of dCas9 with   diverse characteristics of split enzymes, thus creating a part collection named "PC   Reporters Collection".
The Collection includes:
dCas9-split luciferase Parts
Nluc-dCas9 (BBa_K1689010)
Cluc-dCas9 (BBa_K1689009)
dCas9-Nluc (BBa_K1689008)

Among them, the PC reporters with split luciferase oxidizes luciferin   and gives out bioluminescence signal, while the other three reporters take electric   signal as their output, which is also able to be detected and qualified.
