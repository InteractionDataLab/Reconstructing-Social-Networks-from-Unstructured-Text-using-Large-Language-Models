About LiU iGEM
Food allergies are an increasing health issue in several countries and the number of children                     affected has been doubled between the years of 1997 and 2011. It has been                     calculated that                     4 % of the world population have some kind of food allergy. The most common food                     allergies                     are caused by proteins, so called allergens, from tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish,                     wheat and soy. Peanut allergy is not the most common of these food allergies, but it is                     the food                     allergy that causes the largest number of deaths due to anaphylaxis, where blood                     pressure drops                     abruptly and severe breathing difficulties occur. Peanut allergy is a chronic condition in the                     majority of cases, less than 20% outgrow their allergy. Today there is no cure for food                     allergies; avoidance of food allergens is therefore the main solution available for those living                     with food allergies to prevent serious health consequences, which is not an easy task.
The aim of LiU iGEM:s project 2015 is to create a portable and for the consumer easy to use allergen                     detector, specific for the most prevalent peanut allergen, Ara h 1. The detection system can be                     described as consisting of two parts, one biological and one electrical.                     The biological part is an                     epitope-antibody complex, designed by LiU iGEM team. The epitope-antibody complex consists of two                     parts, the first part is Ara h 1 specific antibodies linked to the fluorescent protein Fluorescein                     isothiocyanate (FITC). The second part is made up by red fluorescent protein (RFP) linked to our                     constructed epitope.
