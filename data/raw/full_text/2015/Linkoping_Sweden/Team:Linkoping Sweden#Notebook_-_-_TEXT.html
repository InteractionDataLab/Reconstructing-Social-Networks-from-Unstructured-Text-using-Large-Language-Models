Week 25
2015-06-15 - 2015-06-21
Biobricks were resuspended and transformated. The transformation didn’t give any good results.                         Non-transformed bacteria was tested on plates and in falcon tubes without antibiotics, the                         bacteria grew. The bacteria with antibiotics in a falcon tube didn’t grew. This indicated that                         there wasn’t anything wrong with the bacteria, plates, SOB or the antibiotic. A new                         transformation was made with a refined protocol and with a x1 dilution which gave better                         results. The colonies were restreaked and cultivated in falcon tubes. Later on a plasmid                         preparation was made but the concentration was quite low.
Week 28
2015-07-06 - 2015-07-12
Heatcompetent cells were made and used when transforming the biobricks. The few colonies visible                         were centrifuged down and restreaked and left over night. The next day they were left in falcon                         tubes to grow for another night. A plasmid preperation was made, the result was mesured with                         nanodrop and gave more stable concentrations than earlier, even though some of them were still                         quite low.

Week 29
2015-07-13 - 2015-07-19
A transformation on the biobrick E1010, attatched to pSB1C3, was made. Bacteria had grown on the                         control and the other plates were overgrown. A restreak was still made. The results looked good                         and the control was empty. An over night culture was made in falcon tubes.
Week 30
2015-07-20 - 2015-07-26
After two plasmid preperations on E1010 the concentration was stable around 30 ng/µl. In case                         the quite low concentrations were due to a low growth in the over night cultures a new over                         night was made. Several colonies were picked from the restreak to increase the yeild. Digset,                         ligation and screening was made on the biobricks and the psb1C3 backbone, unfortunately the                         molecules wandered out of the gel. The problem was probably a too wigh voltage. A transformation                         was still made on some of the plasmids. A new digest and ligation was made, this time we cleaned                         our plasmids between the digest and ligation. The concentrations were too low to continue with a                         transfomation. Parallel a second digest and ligation was made and followed up with a screening.
Week 32
2015-08-03 - 2015-08-09
The week started with digestion of epitope 2, which was later controlled on an agarose gel.                         Later this week an efficiency test was conducted on our different digestion enzymes (Pst1. Xba1                         and EcoRi).
Amplification of psb1c3 was conducted via PCR.
Towards the end of the week attempts were made to ligate epitope 2 and k525998 on pSB1C3. The                         ligate were checked on an agarose gel and then transformed into XL1 heat competent cells.
Week 33
2015-08-10 - 2015-08-16
The transformed ligate from the previous week was screened (first PCR then an agarose gel) and                         cultivated over night. The amplified psb1c3 was screened in the same manner. A plasmid                         preparation was conducted on the over night culture.
Epitope 2+ k525998 plasmids on pSB1C3 was then sent to sequencing. At the same time was the                         epitope 2 + k535998 plasmid digested and ligated with digests from E1010, K1319002 and J04500                         respectively. We also conducted digestion and ligation on epitope 2 and J04650. Transformation                         was conducted on all ligations.
Over night and screening was then conducted on the transformed colonies. An efficiency test was                         conducted on newly made heat competent cells.
Plasmid preparations was made on the over night cultures.
Week 35
2015-08-24 - 2015-08-30
When recieving the results from the sequencing we realised that only one of our constructs were                         successful; K525998+epitope 2+ E1010. We continued to work with only this construct.
Next we conducted mutagenesis with the aim to remove a stopcodon that we discovered in our                         coding sequence, this proved to be difficult and several attempts were made. Finally we think we                         succeeded and made reastreaks on the colonies.
At the same time we continued working on the protein expression of RFP.
Week 26
2015-06-22 - 2015-06-28
New falcon tube-preparations were made from previous restreaks. A plasmid preparation was made                         and the concentration was measured. Some plasmids gave acceptable results but there was still                         room for aprovement.
Week 27
2015-06-29 - 2015-07-05
New colonies from previous transformations were prepared in falcon tubes to be cultivated over                         night. A plasmidprep was made and measured with nanodrop, the results were lower than before.                         Several new falcon tube-cultivations were made and incubated. The nanodrop showed a great                         variation in concentration. A screening was made, mostly for practice. The result was quite                         messy but educational.

An attempt on making heatcompetent cells were made and followed up with an efficiency test with                         poor results. The efficiency was between `1 * 10^6` and `3 * 10^7` cfu/μg (clu = colony-forming                         unit). A new attempt was prepared for the following week.
Week 31
2015-07-27 - 2015-08-02
A new digest was made on the backbone puc57 and our synthesized epitope. This was later put on                         an agarose gel. We could not see any digested plasmids. New digests on the backbone and epitope                         were made. This time the separation was visible on the gel.
Week 34
2015-08-17 - 2015-08-23
Starting off this week we continued with the epitope 2 + J04650 plasmid and ran a                         digest/ligation on it with E1010, K1319002 and J04500 respectively and afterwards a                         transformation was made for each ligation. Preparations were also made for the making of                         electrocompetent cells. We then made over night cultures from the transformations.
We received the sequencing results from the first ligations showing success in 3 of the 5                         samples we sent. Plasmid preparations was made from the over night cultures followed by a                         screening of the plasmids.
Electrocompetent was made for the use of protein expression later on.
GFP and RFP was transformed into BL21 Gold cells. The GFP transformation was unsuccessful, a                         reastreak was made from the RFP. Furthermore, over night cultures was made from RFP.
