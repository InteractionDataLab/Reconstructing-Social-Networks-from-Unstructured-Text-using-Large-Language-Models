                    LiU iGEM performed a survey to test the common knowledge about food allergies. The 330 participants
                    were between 18-56 years old and students or employees at Swedish universities*. The survey was
                    conducted in Swedish and spread by social media, mostly on Facebook.
                </P><H3>Education</H3><P>
                    LiU iGEM predicted that participants with a university education including studies of the immune
                    system or allergies and hypersensitivity, i.e. immunology or allergology, would have a greater
                    knowledge about allergies than the ordinary student or employee. Participants were therefore asked
                    whether their university education had included sections of these subjects. A quarter of the
                    participants’ university educations had included sections of immunology or allergology.
                </P><H3>How would you define allergy?</H3><P>
                    Participants were asked to define what an allergy actually is. Students and employees, who have not
                    studied immunology or allergology defined allergy as an abnormal defense mechanism (67 %), inability
                    to break down a certain substance (21 %), a cold linked to a certain stimuli (5 %), a food
                    intolerance (3 %), hives and facial swelling (3%) or as a seasonal cold (1 %). Allergy definitions
                    are summarized in Figure 1. Participants educated in immunology or allergology knows their subject
                    and 95 % answered that an allergy is an abnormal defense mechanism.
                </P><P>
                    An allergic reaction is indeed caused by the immune system, which is the main defense mechanism
                    managing the protection against invading organisms, e.g. bacteria, viruses and parasites. These
                    invading organisms are in many cases harmful and cause illness. An allergy is when the immune system
                    mistakes an otherwise harmless substance as a dangerous intruder. The allergy inducing substances
                    cause the immune system to overreact and produce Immunoglobin E (IgE) antibodies, which in their
                    turn cause a chain reaction of cells releasing histamines and other chemicals leading to an allergic
                    reaction and symptoms that commonly are associated with allergies, such as hives, facial swelling
                    and other cold resembling symptoms<SUP>1</SUP>.
                </P><P>
                    Inability to break down a certain substance is a more suitable description of one type of food
                    intolerance caused by enzyme defects, e.g. lactose intolerance which is the inability to break down
                    lactose, a type of sugar present in dairy products. Food intolerance, unlike food allergy, can have
                    a number of different causes. Food allergy and food intolerance are both a type of food
                    hypersensitivity and are commonly mistaken with each other, but there are some important
                    differences. Food intolerance is not mediated by IgE antibodies in the immune system. Hence the much
                    slower the onset of symptoms, which can be delayed for hours. The symptoms of food intolerance
                    varies but the general symptoms include fatigue, joint pains, dark circles under the eyes, night
                    sweats, diarrhea, vomiting, bloating and irritable bowel and some cases skin symptoms such as rashes
                    and eczema. These symptoms may last for several hours, even days. The food allergy response,
                    mediated by the immune system, is much more rapid and can be triggered by very small amounts of
                    food. Those with food intolerance can tolerate a reasonable, not unlimited, amounts of the food.<SUP>2</SUP></P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-6"><P class="caption">

                    think. Food allergies over all are an increasing health issue in several countries in North America,
                    Europe and Asia, and the number of children affected have been estimated to have doubled between the

                    Participants were asked whether they thought that nut and peanut allergies are more or less common
                    globally than in comparison with solely Sweden. 66 % of the participants thought that the ratio of
                    nut and peanut allergies in Sweden were above the global average, which was the correct conclusion.
                    It has been estimated that 4 % of the world population has some kind of food allergy, but the

                    Participants were asked to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening
                    acute allergic reaction. Symptoms presented to the participants were hives, cardiac arrest, facial
                    swelling, dizziness, stomach pains, elevated pulse and heart rate, runny nose, itching throat and
                    breathing difficulties. All symptoms presented are symptoms of a more or less severe allergic
                    reaction. The symptoms of anaphylaxis varies from person to person, but usually starts with an
                    itching throat, followed by stronger symptoms such as swelling of the lips, stomach pains including
                    vomiting and diarrhea, dizziness, chest pain and breathing difficulties. Severe anaphylaxis causes a
                    drastic drop in blood pressure and elevation in heart rate which in its turn can lead to
                    unconsciousness and cardiac arrest.<SUP>10</SUP> The survey showed that it is rather common knowledge that
                    anaphylaxis affects the respiratory tract and causes breathing difficulties. As well as that some of
                    the first symptoms are swelling and itching of the face and throat. But it is rather few that know
                    that the critical symptoms actually are those that affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular
                    systems. It is important to understand the severity and recognize the symptoms of anaphylaxis.

                    in botany terms the peanut
                    is a leguminous plant (Arachis hypogaea). The actual peanut is the plant seed that grows in the
                    ground, hence the Swedish name jordnöt, directly translated to earth nut. The English name peanut
                    indicates the close relationship to other legume plants, including peas as well as soy beans, beans
                    and lentils.<SUP>11</SUP> Some of those that are allergic to peanuts experience an allergic reaction when
                    eating fruits from other legume plants. This occurs due to cross allergic reactions caused by peanut

                    only one type of nuts, i.e. hazelnut allergy or almond allergy, but since some nuts are more closely
                    related than others cross allergic reactions do occur. E.g. Hazelnuts cross react with Brazil nut,
                    walnut and pecans. It is very uncommon to be allergic to all types of nuts since all nuts do not
                    contain the same allergy inducing substance and half of the participants did not know this.<SUP>14</SUP></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8"><H4>The more allergic reactions you have experienced, the greater risk for a severe allergic

                    of previous reactions. The most important factor of the severity is the dose. For those who

                    substance no allergic reaction occurs and no symptoms are visible, but if the body mistakes the

                    body encounters the substance the reaction described in previous sections is activated by the

                    immunological events causing an allergic reaction.<SUP>17</SUP> The most prevalent allergen in peanuts is Ara h
                    1, which is the substance detected by an antibody complex in LiU iGEM:s peanut detector.   The survey showed that allergens are rather common knowledge.

                    where in the body the histamine is released. Histamine is a hormone that has a key role in the
                    cascade of events included in an allergic reaction and is released in response to allergens binding
                    to IgE antibodies. A larger amount allergens thus increases the amount of histamines released and
                    higher concentrations of histamine affect tissues in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and

                    and children’s allergolog at the Sachsska children’s hospital in Stockholm, are there are no
                    documented life-threatening allergic reactions caused by airborne allergens from peanuts or tree
                    nuts known in the international society of specialized allergolists.<SUP>15</SUP> LiU iGEM has not been able to
                    find any situations that contradict this statement.
                    Unlike what many may think food allergens are not gases that spread interminably in the air. Food
                    allergens are small particles, we are talking about micrometers. Small particles settle slowly
                    throughout the air. Allergens from tree nuts does not spread more than 1-2 meters. Peanuts can
                    eventually spread a little bit longer. Frying and cooking as well as whipping and stirring increase
                    the amount of allergens settling through the air but the air dilution is enormous and therefore a
                    constant production of allergens is required to evoke severe symptoms. Someone eating peanuts from a
                    bag or bowl is therefore luckily not sufficient enough.<SUP>15</SUP></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-8"><H4>Stress/fear can influence an allergic reaction.</H4><P><SPAN class="true">True</SPAN>: Experiencing allergic symptoms, such as itching and swelling of the

                    feels like you are going to suffocate. Fear and panic induce an allergic reaction even further,
                    since the body’s stress response interacts with many of those organs and tissues affected during an
