Safety within the lab
We have received safety training regarding waste disposal, biosafety, fire safety, handling                     dangerous                     materials and chemicals, emergency exits, working with microorganisms and personal protection,                     corresponding to a BSL 1.1 This was conducted by the biosafety officer from our                     institution                     (IFM -                     Institution for Biology, Chemistry and Physics), who raised no safety issues with our                     project.2
One risk that we are taking is the contamination risk while working with bacteria, and to                     accidentely                     spread their resistance. To reduce those risks, modified bacteria are always kept at restricted                     areas                     and we throw all material which has been in contact with bacteria in a specific waste. All                     instruments                     and waste that have been in contact with bacteria are autoclaved.
Another risk factor that we are exposed to is while staining and analyzing agarose gels, where we                     use                     ethidium bromide and an UV transilluminator. To minimize the risks we are using nitril gloves,                     rubber                     gloves and goggles while handeling the ethidium bromide and we are using covers and goggles while                     handeling the UV transilluminator. Moreover we are always using protective lab coats at the lab and                     nitril gloves in those cases there is a risk for us or for contaminating the samples.
A list of all organisms, new parts and modified protein coding parts that our team use can be found here .
The Escherichia. coli strains that we used in our project are lab strains that are not harmful to                     humans, and all fall under Risk Group 1.
Safety of our product outside the lab
As mentioned previously we are taking precautions regarding contamination risks as well as the risk                     of spreading bacterial resistance. Since we are using genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), all                     material that has been in contact with GMM are decontaminated. Chemical desinfection is also used on                     areas exposed of GMM.3
Beyond that, everything being in contact with bacteria is always autoclaved, the waste is handled in                     a way that ensures the safety for all employees and students. All laboratory waste must be packed                     and labelled according to instructions and only laboratory personnel are allowed to handle the                     waste. The cleaning staff is only allowed to handle regular paperwaste which has not been in contact                     with bacteria or other chemical or biological compounds.
Only approved packing is allowed to be used and is ordered from designated suppliers and laboratory                     waste are left at designated areas.4 All chemical waste labelled with hazard symbols are handled as hazardous waste.5 All                     antibiotic waste is treated as GMM waste to avoid antibiotics reaching the ecosystem. Furthermore,                     in order to                     avoid releasing antibiotic substances in nature all antibiotic waste is autoclaved.6
Above this our final product does not cause any safety issues outside the lab. Since no living                     bacteria is used in our product, only protein, there is no such risk of bacterial contamination,                     spread of bacterial resistance or infection.
