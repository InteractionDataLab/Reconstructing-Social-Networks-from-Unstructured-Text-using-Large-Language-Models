                    To design our protein, the two biobricks K525998 and E1010 was ligated together with our own custom
                    synthesized sequence, epitope 2 of Ara h 1. We also found that due to the restriction sites a stop
                    codon appeared between each ligated part, which might be a good explanation why the protein
                    expression was unsuccessful during previous years project. We aimed to solve this problem by
                    mutagenesis. However, due to faulty primers we have not gotten past this step yet.
                </P><H3>Detector</H3><P>
                    We now have a new 3D-printed prototype of the detector with a different design. Some improvements
                    have been made from the last years detector. We have now included a second filter, where both red
                    and green light can pass. This is a great improvement since we now can detect not only the decrease
                    in red light due to a decrease in FRET, but also the difference in light output between the two
                    filters which correlates with the increase of green light.
                </P><H3>Modeling</H3><P>
                    The field of modeling is completely new for this year and brings great news to the project. Through
                    this modeling we found out that our detector could within seconds be able to tell the consumers if
                    the food is safe to eat or not depending on which model coincides best with reality. Interestingly,
                    we found that all models have the potential to reach the theoretical limit of the detector.
                </P><H3>Outreach to the society</H3><P>
                    The main purpose of iGEM is to spread knowledge and create an interest for synthetic biology, for
                    which we have given a lot of effort. We have been working hard to reach out to a lot of different
                    people through social media, newscasts as well as through social interactions. Our work has paid
                    off, since we have received great response and interest for both iGEM and our product.
                </P><H3>Presentations and Events</H3><P>
                    We have held several presentations for groups of different ages. Our main goal was to get people
                    interested in synthetic biology but also to show the opportunity that iGEM gives when it comes to
                    designing your own project. By explaining the different work fields within iGEM we also managed to
                    arouse the interest of many.
                </P><P>
                    We also attended NärCon, a convention here in Linköping, during this summer. Here a lot of people
                    showed us interest, especially in our mascot mr Peanut.
                </P><P>
                    These are the the events we have attended so far. However, we will continue to attend a lot of
                    exhibitions and hold more presentations for students in time to come. Among other things, some of
                    our group members will participate at “forskarfredag”, a science convention in Linköping, at the
                    time of the giant jamboree in Boston.
                </P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-6"><H3>Education</H3><P>
                    For the younger population we wrote and illustrated a children’s book, where some animals with
                    different allergies, intolerances, and knowledge go on a picnic. The aim of the book is to educate
                    at an early age and to deepen the understanding of allergies among children.
                </P><P>
                    To engage the adult population for research made in synthetic biology, we started our project
                    “Science 2 Go”, where we wrote short summaries of scientific papers, easy to understand for the
                    general public. The summaries were published on our Facebook page.
                </P><P>                   Because our project revolves around food allergies we also produced a mini documentary where we
                    interview a young allergic woman, the mother of an allergic child, a children allergist and a
                    scientist specialised in child allergies. The aim of this mini documentary was to get a more
                    complete picture of allergies as well as the problems surrounding them and to share it with the
                    public.
                </P><H3>Surveys</H3><P>
                    Two surveys was completed, to test the knowledge about allergies in a given population as well as
                    the interest for our product among people suffering from peanut allergy.
                </P><P>
                    The knowledge about allergies was tested among students and employees at swedish universities, since
                    they were a representative population we could reach. When those who answered this survey were asked
                    if their knowledge about allergies were sufficient or not, 68% thought that it was not.
                </P><P>
                    The market survey for our product was exclusively for those suffering from peanut allergy, were we
                    asked about the interest and need of a peanut detecting system. This told us that 93% of the 130
                    people who answered would be interested in a peanut detector.
                </P><H3>Media</H3><P>
                    After getting interviewed by “SVT Östergötland”, our local television news we received great
                    response. Thereafter, we appeared at the national news after which we were contacted by our local
                    newspaper, Corren. This has given great attention to both iGEM and Linköping University in general.
                </P><P>
                    We have also been active through social medias, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and a little
                    bit on Youtube, where we have reached out to a lot of people.
