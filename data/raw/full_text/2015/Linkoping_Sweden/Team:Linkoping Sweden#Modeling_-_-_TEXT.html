Modeling
The purpose
To get an estimate of how the detection system would work under ideal conditions we created two                     mathematical                     models of the system. These two models represent two likely scenarios of how the biological process                     works.                     Using these models we can simulate the biological reactions that occur within the sample area when                     the
peanut protein Ara h 1 is introduced and thus estimate parameters and variables involved in the                 process.                 Furthermore, by estimating the detectors dimensional, optical and electrical restrictions we can                 estimate                 the final signal strength of the detector.
The models
By researching the many reactions involved in the biological process we finally created the                     following                     mass                     action models for the system.
Model 1
`(dEAC)/dt=k1f*Ab*E-k1b*EAC-k2f*EAC*Ar`
`(dA AC)/dt=k2f*EAC*Ar-k3f*A AC+k3b*Ar*Ab`
`(dAb)/dt=k3f*A AC-k3b*Ab*Ar-k1f*Ab*E+k1b*EAC`
`(dE)/dt=k2f*EAC*Ar-k1f*Ab*E+k1b*EAC`
`(dAr)/dt=k3f*A AC-k2f*Ar*EAC-k3b*Ar*Ab`
Model 2
`(dEAC)/dt=k1f*Ab*E-k1b*EAC`
`(dA AC)/dt=k3f*Ab*Ar-k3b*A AC`
`(dAb)/dt=k3b*A AC-k3f*Ab*Ar-k1f*Ab*E`
`(dE)/dt=k1b*EAC-k1f*Ab*E`
`(dAr)/dt=k3b*A AC-k3f*Ar*Ab`
EAC and AAC are the epitope- and Ara h 1-antibody complexes. Ab, E and Ar are the antibodies,                     epitopes                     and Ara h 1 proteins that create the complexes. The differential equations above describes the                     interactions between these molecules with the association (f) and dissociation (b) rate constants                     k1-3.1, 2, 3
For model 1 we assume that the change from epitope to Ara h 1 is done by changing one protein for                     the                     other, independently of the dissociation of proteins. In model 2 on the other hand, the change from                     epitope to Ara h 1 is instead dependant of the protein dissociation.
Using the modelling and simulation tool Wolfram SystemModeler the following models were then                     created:
Figure 1. Model 1. Mathematical model for the biological process. White circles indicate                     product                     and                     blue                     indicates substrate. Green circles represent the concentrations of the different constituents                     that                     build                     the process. The reaction rates in the process are denoted k1-2-3.
Figure 2. Model 2. Mathematical model for the biological process. White circles indicate                     product                     and                     blue indicates substrate. Green circles represent the concentrations of the different                     constituents                     that                     build the process. The reaction rates in the process are denoted k1 and k3.
These models were then used in combination with an estimate, `U_(conversion)`, of the detectors                     electrical,                     optical and biological effects to describe the full detection system.
`U_(RFPconversion)=I_(flux)*epsilon*l*Bp*D_(befo                     re)*E_(FRET)*Q_(RFP)*D_(after)*Lp_(RFP)*E_(RFP)*R/(6.241*10^18)`
`U_(FITCconversion)=I_(flux)*epsilon*l*Bp*D_(befo                     re)*Q_(FITC)*D_(after)*Lp_(FITC)*E_(FITC)*R/(6.241*10^18)`
The optical restrictions that the filters exert on the photon flux are described by BP and LP for                     the                     band pass and long pass filters respectively4, 5, 6. `D_(befo re)` and `D_(after)` are estimates                     of                     how the                     dimensions of the detector affect the photon flux. The fluorophores, fluorescein isothiocyanate                     (FITC)                     and red fluorescent proteins (RFP) quantum yield, Q, affects the flux as well as the förster                     resonance                     energy transfer (FRET) interaction, `E_(FRET)`, between the fluorophores7, 8, 9. The amount of                     absorbed                     photons by the FITC fluorophores is determined by the absorbance of the solution, calculated with the                     path length, l, the molar attenuation coefficient, `epsilon`, and the molar concentration used in                     later equations10. `I_(flux)` is an estimate of how many photons that are
emitted from the LED light                     after                     passing the first filter in the detection system4, 11. In order to estimate the electrical                     restrictions of the detector we need the sensors photon to electron conversion efficiency `E_(FITC)`                     and                     `E_(RFP)`                     for FITC and RFP emitted photons12. When used in combination with a resistance, R, and the amount                     of                     electron, `6.241*10^18`, required for 1 ampere current we can calculate the current created from a                     specific                     concentration of antibody complexes.
`U_(conversion)` is multiplied with the molar concentration change of the antibody complexes which                     yields the                     voltage change over time.
`(dU_(senso r1))/dt=(dU_(RFP))/dt=U_(RFPconversion)*(dEAC)/dt`
The Results
By using the model described in the section “The Model” the following simulations were created using                     Wolfram SystemModeler.
When comparing the two models we can see in Figure 3 that both models could in theory achieve high                     enough voltage, `10^-6`, for the detector to be able to read the signal. The main difference, for                     our purposes, seems to be that the process of changing from epitope to Ara h 1 takes up to 3 minutes to                     reach steady state in model 2, seen in Figure 4.
In model 1 on the other hand the biological process requires only 5-6 seconds to reach steady state                     after Ara h 1 has been introduced to the system, also seen in Figure 4. The detector should                     therefore in                     theory be able to give the user results within seconds after a sample has been taken.
Furthermore, a                     molar concentration for the epitope complex of `10^-6` seems to be optimal for the system, any lower                     and                     the detections systems hardware would not be able to detect the signal, any higher and the molecules                     in                     the detector would disrupt the photon flux too much resulting in a major signal disruption.13
The simulation of the detection systems sensor output as well as the calculated voltage generated by                     FITC is show in Figure 3. By using these two sensor systems it will be possible to determine if the                     signal change is created due to a complex change or simply because more molecules have been                     introduced                     to the sample area. When comparing the signal strength of the sensors in Figure 3 it is clear that                     the                     two sensor system is able to generate a larger signal change than either sensor on its own.
