Hold your breath – early discoveries of airborne food allergies
2015-08-03
Allergens is a fancy word for substances causing allergic reactions. Airborne allergens are known to                     play a key role in causing asthma and other allergic symptoms. Allergic asthma is considered to be                     triggered by allergens such as dust mite, cat dander or grass pollen. These allergens spread freely                     in the air and are therefore called aeroallergens. However in the case of food allergies, the                     allergens are generally considered to cause allergic reactions by direct physical contact via the                     skin or mouth, which indicate that food allergens are easier to avoid than aeroallergens.
Nevertheless in the late 90’s, the pediatric chest and allergy clinic at St Mary’s hospital                     discovered that some children with food allergies seem to develop allergic and asthmatic symptoms                     when present in a room where food is being cooked. This suggested that food allergens may act as                     aero allergens as well.
A study including 750 children and teenagers with food allergies and coexistent asthma identified 12                     children with IgE-mediated food allergy who in addition suffered from asthmatic symptoms within                     minutes on inhalational exposure to the particular food allergens. Symptoms such as wheezing, chest                     tightening or coughing were observed on more than one occasion. The implicated foods were fish,                     milk, chickpeas, buckwheat and eggs.

Nine out of the 12 children underwent a bronchial food challenge, which allows measurement of lung                     capacity and function. When exposed to the food during cooking five children developed asthmatic                     symptoms and changes in lung function. Two children also had late phase responses, suggesting that                     aerosolized food allergens cause bronchial inflammation. This highlights the importance of knowledge                     about food allergies, because for some people dietary avoidance alone may not be sufficient.
