The challenge
Food allergies are an increasing health issue in several countries and the number of children                     affected has been doubled between the years of 1997 and 20111, 2, 3. It has been                     calculated that                     4 % of the world population have some kind of food allergy4, 5, 6. The most common food                     allergies                     are caused by proteins, so called allergens, from tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish,                     wheat and soy6. Peanut allergy is not the most common of these food allergies, but it is                     the food                     allergy that causes the largest number of deaths due to anaphylaxis7, where blood                     pressure drops                     abruptly and severe breathing difficulties occur. Peanut allergy is a chronic condition in the                     majority of cases, less than 20% outgrow their allergy8. Today there is no cure for food                     allergies; avoidance of food allergens is therefore the main solution available for those living                     with food allergies to prevent serious health consequences9, which is not an easy task.
The solution
The aim of LiU iGEM:s project 2015 is to create a portable and for the consumer easy to use allergen                     detector, specific for the most prevalent peanut allergen, Ara h 1. The detection system can be                     described as consisting of two parts, one biological and one electrical.                     The biological part is an                     epitope-antibody complex, designed by LiU iGEM team. The epitope-antibody complex consists of two                     parts, the first part is Ara h 1 specific antibodies linked to the fluorescent protein Fluorescein                     isothiocyanate (FITC). The second part is made up by red fluorescent protein (RFP) linked to our                     constructed epitope.
 
The epitope emulates the Ara h 1 protein, thus binding to the antibodies.                     When the two parts of the complex are bound, the close proximity of the fluorophores allows Förster                     resonance energy transfer or FRET to occur. This energy transfer allows photons absorbed by FITC to                     be transferred to RFP where the emission wavelength is greater than it would be if emitted from                     FITC. If the sample of interest, e.g. a chocolate bar, contains Ara h 1, i.e. peanuts, the allergen                     will bind to the antibody complex instead of the constructed epitope. This change of bound protein                     hinders FRET, causing a change in fluorescent emission which can be detected and processed by the                     electrical system of the detector. The detector indicates to the user if there has occurred a shift                     in emission wavelength by lighting small LEDs on the detector, where a red light indicates                     contamination of peanuts and green indicates that it is safe to eat.
