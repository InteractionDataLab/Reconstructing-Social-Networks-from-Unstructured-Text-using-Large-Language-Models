Food Allergy
A mini documentary
To get a deeper view of what it means to be allergic to a food substance, LiU iGEM produced a                     documentary movie. A young allergic woman, the mother of an allergic child, a childrens allergist                     and a scientist specialised in child allergies participated in this documentary to share their                     experiences of living and working with food allergies.
The purpose of this documentary is to provide a deeper understanding of any eventual needs for an                     allergen detector. This is done by gathering opinions from the affected of how they feel about                     relying on the public to understand their needs. The goal is also to present it to the public and                     increase their understanding of food allergies and what obsticles people with food allergies might                     experience in their everyday life.
