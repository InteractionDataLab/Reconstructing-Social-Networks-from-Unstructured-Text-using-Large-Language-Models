                        Biobricks were resuspended and transformated. The transformation didn’t give any good results.
                        Non-transformed bacteria was tested on plates and in falcon tubes without antibiotics, the
                        bacteria grew. The bacteria with antibiotics in a falcon tube didn’t grew. This indicated that
                        there wasn’t anything wrong with the bacteria, plates, SOB or the antibiotic. A new
                        transformation was made with a refined protocol and with a x1 dilution which gave better
                        results. The colonies were restreaked and cultivated in falcon tubes. Later on a plasmid
                        preparation was made but the concentration was quite low.

                        Heatcompetent cells were made and used when transforming the biobricks. The few colonies visible
                        were centrifuged down and restreaked and left over night. The next day they were left in falcon
                        tubes to grow for another night. A plasmid preperation was made, the result was mesured with
                        nanodrop and gave more stable concentrations than earlier, even though some of them were still
                        quite low.

                        A transformation on the biobrick E1010, attatched to pSB1C3, was made. Bacteria had grown on the
                        control and the other plates were overgrown. A restreak was still made. The results looked good
                        and the control was empty. An over night culture was made in falcon tubes.
                    </P></DIV><DIV><H3>Week 30</H3><H5>2015-07-20 - 2015-07-26</H5><P>
                        After two plasmid preperations on E1010 the concentration was stable around 30 ng/µl. In case
                        the quite low concentrations were due to a low growth in the over night cultures a new over
                        night was made. Several colonies were picked from the restreak to increase the yeild. Digset,
                        ligation and screening was made on the biobricks and the psb1C3 backbone, unfortunately the
                        molecules wandered out of the gel. The problem was probably a too wigh voltage. A transformation
                        was still made on some of the plasmids. A new digest and ligation was made, this time we cleaned
                        our plasmids between the digest and ligation. The concentrations were too low to continue with a
                        transfomation. Parallel a second digest and ligation was made and followed up with a screening.

                        Later this week an efficiency test was conducted on our different digestion enzymes (Pst1. Xba1
                        and EcoRi).
                    </P><P>
                        Amplification of psb1c3 was conducted via PCR.
                    </P><P>
                        Towards the end of the week attempts were made to ligate epitope 2 and k525998 on pSB1C3. The
                        ligate were checked on an agarose gel and then transformed into XL1 heat competent cells.

                        The transformed ligate from the previous week was screened (first PCR then an agarose gel) and
                        cultivated over night. The amplified psb1c3 was screened in the same manner. A plasmid
                        preparation was conducted on the over night culture.

                        Epitope 2+ k525998 plasmids on pSB1C3 was then sent to sequencing. At the same time was the
                        epitope 2 + k535998 plasmid digested and ligated with digests from E1010, K1319002 and J04500
                        respectively. We also conducted digestion and ligation on epitope 2 and J04650. Transformation
                        was conducted on all ligations.
                    </P><P>
                        Over night and screening was then conducted on the transformed colonies. An efficiency test was
                        conducted on newly made heat competent cells.

                        Plasmid preparations was made on the over night cultures.

                        When recieving the results from the sequencing we realised that only one of our constructs were
                        successful; K525998+epitope 2+ E1010. We continued to work with only this construct.
                    </P><P>
                        Next we conducted mutagenesis with the aim to remove a stopcodon that we discovered in our
                        coding sequence, this proved to be difficult and several attempts were made. Finally we think we
                        succeeded and made reastreaks on the colonies.
                    </P><P>
                        At the same time we continued working on the protein expression of RFP.

                        New falcon tube-preparations were made from previous restreaks. A plasmid preparation was made
                        and the concentration was measured. Some plasmids gave acceptable results but there was still
                        room for aprovement.

                        New colonies from previous transformations were prepared in falcon tubes to be cultivated over
                        night. A plasmidprep was made and measured with nanodrop, the results were lower than before.
                        Several new falcon tube-cultivations were made and incubated. The nanodrop showed a great
                        variation in concentration. A screening was made, mostly for practice. The result was quite
                        messy but educational.

                        An attempt on making heatcompetent cells were made and followed up with an efficiency test with
                        poor results. The efficiency was between `1 * 10^6` and `3 * 10^7` cfu/μg (clu = colony-forming
                        unit). A new attempt was prepared for the following week.

                        A new digest was made on the backbone puc57 and our synthesized epitope. This was later put on
                        an agarose gel. We could not see any digested plasmids. New digests on the backbone and epitope
                        were made. This time the separation was visible on the gel.

                        Starting off this week we continued with the epitope 2 + J04650 plasmid and ran a
                        digest/ligation on it with E1010, K1319002 and J04500 respectively and afterwards a
                        transformation was made for each ligation. Preparations were also made for the making of
                        electrocompetent cells. We then made over night cultures from the transformations.

                        We received the sequencing results from the first ligations showing success in 3 of the 5
                        samples we sent. Plasmid preparations was made from the over night cultures followed by a
                        screening of the plasmids.

                        GFP and RFP was transformed into BL21 Gold cells. The GFP transformation was unsuccessful, a
