Intake of peanuts, milk and wheat during pregnancy can reduce the risk of allergy and asthma in                 children
2015-07-06
Allergy and asthma are growing health problems in the world. It has previously been supposed by many                     clinicians and researchers that allergenic food avoidance during the time of pregnancy, lactation                     and the first period of the infant’s life could prevent atopic diseases. However, during the first                     trimester of pregnancy the formal period of fetal immune system development is taking place,                     including the early formation of many cells involved in the immune system response. It is therefore                     hypothesized, by Bunyavanich et al., that this first supposition is incorrect. Instead, they believe                     that an intake of allergenic food might influence the immune system development positively.
During their study this hypothesis was tested for some allergenic foods. It was found that an intake                     of peanuts during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 47 % decrease in the odds                     of a peanut allergic reaction among the children. A maternal intake of milk during the same period                     was associated with 17 % and 15 % reduced odds of childhood asthma and allergic mucosal inflammation                     respectively. Moreover an intake of wheat during the second trimester was associated with 36 %                     reduced odds of eczema from an allergic reaction. However, no associations could be seen between                     maternal egg and soy consumption and childhood outcomes.

The physiological conclusion from these                     results is that such effects are food-specific since different foods contain different nutrients.                     Peanuts, for example, contain linoleic acid (an essential fatty acid) and milk contains D-vitamins,                     which both previously have been found to be important for the immune system response in different                     ways.
