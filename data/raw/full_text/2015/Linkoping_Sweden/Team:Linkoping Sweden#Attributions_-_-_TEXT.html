We would like to thank everyone who have helped us this summer. We have Professor Robert                     Forchheimer,                     who started the iGEM team here at Linköping University back in 2013, whitout whom LiU iGEM wouldn’t                     excist. He has helped us with his knowledge and support, as well as kindly opened his doors to his                     home for us to have a kick-off. We also would like to thank Lars-Göran Mårtenssen, who has                     helped us get                     through some rough part with his knowlegde and invaluable advices. He has also helped us with                     handeling                     of sending samples for sequencing, for which we are very grateful. Professor Per Hammarström has                     also                     helped us a lot and we really want to thank you for all support! We would also like to thank Anna                     Borg,                     whom we could call when we felt lost or needed help with something, thank you for your for all your                     help! Cecilia Andrésen has also helped us, we are                     forever thankful to her wisdom. We have also received very valuable support and equipment for the                     detector                     construction from David Beuger at Rapid Prototyping here at Linköping University, whom we                     would like to give a big                     thank to. In the modeling department we would like to thank Mikael Forsgren at MathCore for                     helping us out and providing licenses for their SystemModeler software which has come to great use                     for our team.
We would also like to give a huge thank you to Linköping University and IFM, both for                     sponsoring us                     monetary and for letting us use one of the laboraories to work in during this summer.
Of course we would like to thank all our sponsors, whether they helped us monetary or with                     laboratory equipments and kits, we are equally grateful.
Thank you all for your support,
this project would                 not have been possible without each and every one of you!
