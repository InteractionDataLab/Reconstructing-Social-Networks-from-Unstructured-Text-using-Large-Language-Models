New possible therapeutics for food allergy
2015-06-22
Food allergy diseases have rapidly increased during the last few decades. There are no therapeutics                     for people suffering from food allergies. Today’s treatments are only based on treating the symptoms                     which arise when the patient accidently get in contact with the allergens. Therefore the fears of                     accidental ingestion significantly impair the quality of life for millions of people around the                     world. Food allergy is an immune mediated response to specific proteins in food; in most cases the                     antibody IgE is responsible for triggering the response. One of the most promising new therapeutics                     for the treatment of food allergy is Omalizumabwhich binds IgE, thereby preventing it to bind FcεRI,                     the high-affinity IgE receptor expressed on mast cells and basophiles. These two cells are both                     white blood cells that contain granules of histamine. When Omalizumab binds the antibody it causes                     the serum IgE levels to dramatically reduce which in turn decreases the FcεRI expression on                     basophils and mast cells. When the FcεRI receptors lessen, the levels of released histamines                     decrease and thereby preventing allergic symptoms. Still, Omalizumab is only one of many allergy                     therapeutics targeting the IgE-interactions that is advancing with positive results showing great                     prospect for future research.

More comprehensive trials are needed to determine the safety and                     efficiency of these therapeutics. Anyhow, continued advancement in understanding these mechanisms                     gives hope that a treatment for food allergy will be available in the near future.
