                    Alongside our main project, to build a portable peanut detector, LiU iGEM has conducted several
                    projects to make the everyday life more secure for those in fear of getting dangerous allergic
                    reactions from their food.
                </P><P>
                    We were fortunate to have insightful discussions with participants in our side projects. One of them
                    suffered from multiple food allergies, with peanuts causing the most problems, and stated the
                    following about the public awareness of food allergies.
                </P><P style="font-style: italic;">
                    “Lack of knowledge is the biggest problem and the ignorance stems from this lack of knowledge. How
                    will you know of you don’t understand the consequences? How will you be able to respect it?”

                    It goes without saying that LiU iGEM wants to reach out to the public and raise awareness of food
                    allergies, especially peanut allergy. We have thoroughly researched and emotionally explored the
                    world of food allergies. Our goal is to communicate what we have learnt, and to do so in several
                    different ways to cover as much ground as possible.
                </P><H3>Get the word out - Synthetic biology</H3><P>
                    Apart from spreading information about peanut allergy, we also want to inform the public in how we
                    by using synthetic biology can deal with real life problems. We have made a particular effort in
                    getting in touch with the youth in our area to convey the possibilities of synthetic biology. By
                    holding lectures for students in secondary school, high school and university we are hoping to spark
                    their interest.

                    band The Offspring as “Pretty fly for a white guy”. It was produced and mixed by Johan Blomqvist at
                    AfterNine studios, for whom we are grateful. It was formerly part of our undeveloped project, a
                    collaborative music video among iGEM teams worldwide.

                    The aim of the video was to demonstrate the great community of iGEM where sharing of knowledge and
                    information is central. We with a couple of iGEM-teams. The teams were; Macquaire Australia and
                    Groningen, the Netherlands, who have recorded some of the clips to be used in the video.

                    However, we never got time to complete the work, but we aim to do so after the jamboree. Thereafter,
                    our aim will be to use it as a promotion for iGEM, to recruit new members to the teams as well as to
                    increase the interest of iGEM and the competition.

                    BIOSINT México has written a splendid guide for the iGEM Community regarding ethics for synthetic
                    biology. We helped them by making a translated version, now available in Swedish. You can access the
