More about us
Lisa Bransell
I am a medical biology student, currently in my final year. Originally, I am from                                 a town called Uppsala, which is located 1 hour north of our capital city Stockholm.                                 Besides                                 my                                 passion for science, I have a great passion for food! I am constantly hungry and I'm                                 always                                 eating!
Favorite protein Vanilla Whey
10 years from now I am eating food! Not in the lab though, safety first! ;)
Marielle Danelljan
I have always been eager to understand and learn more about the surrounding world, to me                                 curiosity is vital quality. I find chemistry absolutely fascinating and therefore it                                 came                                 naturally to study engineering in chemical biology.
Favorite protein Rubisco
10 years from now I would like to find myself in a place where I can constantly learn new things                                 and develop as a person. Although, if this perfect image would somehow never be                                 fulfilled                                 you will find me at my parents basement, long lost with my lvl 140 mage in World of                                 Warcraft.
Agnes Ekberger
I have lived both in the countryside and in the ciity. I've always been interested in                                 the                                 field                                 of biology, and now I'm studying for my bachelor degree in biology. I'm still figuring                                 out                                 what                                 field of biology I want to pursue, but it will probably be genetics. In my freetime I                                 like                                 to be                                 out and about and walk around outside, preferably with a camera in my hands. I'm also                                 very                                 social and likes to hang out with friends and family. I also love my cats very much, my                                 sweet                                 company at home!
Favorite protein Hemoglobin, because it's a really cool protein that you can learn alot about and the                                 oxygen                                 transportation is pretty good for survival. ;)
10 years from now I have become a master in the genetic field of biology, and I have succeeded to                                 genetically                                 manipulate the best LiU iGEM team ever. Or I have a cool job at a lab somewhere, that                                 would                                 be                                 okay too.

Elina Jansson
I'm from the Åland Islands (not actually Swedish) and grew up in the countryside.                                 Chemical biology is what I do mainly but I also have a keen interest in environmental science and                                 engineering! Most of my spare time I commit to spex, a special branch of                                 theater/musical/farce/student comedy, where I'm a technician and play in the orchestra.
Favorite protein Pikachurin!
10 years from now I'm probably both smarter and dumber than now. But hopefully I'm enjoying life and                                 science.
Sandra Lilja
I'm a countryside girl, grown up among animals and even worked with animals for a                                 period.                                 Then I                                 realized animal keeping is so old school, so I decided to move to the big city Linköping                                 and                                 become a geneticist instead.
