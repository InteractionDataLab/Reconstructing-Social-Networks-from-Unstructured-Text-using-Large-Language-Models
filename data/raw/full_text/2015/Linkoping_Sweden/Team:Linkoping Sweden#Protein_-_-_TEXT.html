The Protein
The protein is a composition of the biobricks BBa_E1010 (red fluorescent protein, RFP) and                     BBa_K525998 (promotor T7 and RBS) which are inserted together with Epitope 2 from Ara h 1 into a                     psb1c3-vector.
When digesting and ligating the biobricks in order to obtain the desired sequence, a stop codon                     appeared between the biobricks, this problem was solved using single point mutagenesis where the                     stop codon was exchanged with leucine. Leucine is a small amino acid with an unpolar side chain and                     will therefore have a very small impact on the protein.
To avoid misfolding of the protein, a linker composed of the amino acids glycine and serine is used                     to separate the epitope from RFP. Glycine is a small amino acid and provides flexibility1 to the                     linker while serine adds stability2.
GS-linker is used to separate the epitope sequence from RFP.
Epitope 2 was chosen due to its location on the surface of the Ara h 1 allowing the antibodies to                     recognize the sequence in it’s native form unlike epitopes located on the inside of Ara h 1 which                     can only be recognized when the full length protein has been denatured.
The antibodies which the protein construct is supposed to bind to are monoclonal and specific for                     epitope 2. These antibodies are conjugated with three to six fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)                     molecules which absorbs light at 495 nm and emits at 519 nm. If RFP is close enough it can absorb                     the light emitted by FITC and emit light at a higher wavelength; 607 nm. This phenomenon is called                     Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).

Stop codon
The rest of the sequence is RFP from the biobrick E1010. This creates the protein complex of epitope                     and RFP, shown i Figure 1.
