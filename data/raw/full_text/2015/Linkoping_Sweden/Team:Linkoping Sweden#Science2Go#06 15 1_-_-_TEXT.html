IL9 gene expression helps distinguish between peanut allergy and peanut sensitivity
2015-06-15
There is a difference between patients who have peanut allergy (PA) and peanut sensitivity (PS).                     Those who are sensitive tolerate peanut, but have peanut-specific IgE-antibodies which makes them                     show a positive skin prick test response. Brought et al (2014) conducted a study where they aimed to                     characterize peanut-specific responses from patients with peanut allergy, peanut sensitivity and                     atopic children (children who have predisposition toward developing certain allergic                     hypersensitivity reactions, for example eczema) without peanut allergy. They investigated gene                     expressions in peanut-activated memory TH subsets (TH memory cells are a kind of cells within the                     immune system) from the three groups to see if they could identify potential diagnostic biomarkers                     specific for peanut allergy. Among all differentially expressed genes (which were a total of 12,257)                     it was IL9 that showed the greatest difference between the patients with peanut allergy and the                     patients without peanut allergy. The research group also concluded that the IL9 gene showed the                     highest difference in expression not only between the patients with and without peanut allergy, but                     also could distinguish the patients with peanut sensitivity.

The opportunity to distinguish between people who are allergic and those who are sensitive to                     peanuts gives the sensitive patients the ability to live more normal lives where they do not have to                     live with all the restrictions that come with peanut allergy.
