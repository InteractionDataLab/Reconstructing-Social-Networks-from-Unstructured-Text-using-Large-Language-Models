                                I am a medical biology student, currently in my final year. Originally, I am from
                                a town called Uppsala, which is located 1 hour north of our capital city Stockholm.

                                I have always been eager to understand and learn more about the surrounding world, to me
                                curiosity is vital quality. I find chemistry absolutely fascinating and therefore it
                                came
                                naturally to study engineering in chemical biology.

                                I have lived both in the countryside and in the ciity. I've always been interested in
                                the

                                of biology, and now I'm studying for my bachelor degree in biology. I'm still figuring
                                out
                                what
                                field of biology I want to pursue, but it will probably be genetics. In my freetime I
                                like
                                to be
                                out and about and walk around outside, preferably with a camera in my hands. I'm also
                                very
                                social and likes to hang out with friends and family. I also love my cats very much, my

                                Hemoglobin, because it's a really cool protein that you can learn alot about and the

                                transportation is pretty good for survival. ;)
