Overview of Policy and Practice
The Public and Peanut Allergy
Alongside our main project, to build a portable peanut detector, LiU iGEM has conducted several                     projects to make the everyday life more secure for those in fear of getting dangerous allergic                     reactions from their food.
We were fortunate to have insightful discussions with participants in our side projects. One of them                     suffered from multiple food allergies, with peanuts causing the most problems, and stated the                     following about the public awareness of food allergies.
“Lack of knowledge is the biggest problem and the ignorance stems from this lack of knowledge. How                     will you know of you don’t understand the consequences? How will you be able to respect it?”
Becka                     Lexén, 22, student.
It goes without saying that LiU iGEM wants to reach out to the public and raise awareness of food                     allergies, especially peanut allergy. We have thoroughly researched and emotionally explored the                     world of food allergies. Our goal is to communicate what we have learnt, and to do so in several                     different ways to cover as much ground as possible.
Get the word out - Synthetic biology
Apart from spreading information about peanut allergy, we also want to inform the public in how we                     by using synthetic biology can deal with real life problems. We have made a particular effort in                     getting in touch with the youth in our area to convey the possibilities of synthetic biology. By                     holding lectures for students in secondary school, high school and university we are hoping to spark                     their interest.
Policy and Practice projects
“Keep calm and go nuts, without peanuts”
A market survey for people with peanut allergy.
“Do you know nothing or nuthings?”
A study over the common knowledge of peanut allergy among students and employees at universities.
“Food Allergies - A Mini Documentary”
A video where aspects of food allergy is discussed by a physician, scientists and persons dealing                     with food allergies.
"Can I eat this?"
A fun and informative children’s book about the elephant Tiny.
"Science 2 Go"
A concept were members of the LiU iGEM team has provided easy accessible                     summaries of previous research connected to our project, food allergies, biotechnology or                     synthetic biology.

Listen to our song recorded in studio quality!
“Pretty fly for a nerd girl”, an iGEM inspired cover. The song was originally performed by the famous                     band The Offspring as “Pretty fly for a white guy”. It was produced and mixed by Johan Blomqvist at                     AfterNine studios, for whom we are grateful. It was formerly part of our undeveloped project, a                     collaborative music video among iGEM teams worldwide.
The aim of the video was to demonstrate the great community of iGEM where sharing of knowledge and                     information is central. We with a couple of iGEM-teams. The teams were; Macquaire Australia and                     Groningen, the Netherlands, who have recorded some of the clips to be used in the video.
However, we never got time to complete the work, but we aim to do so after the jamboree. Thereafter,                     our aim will be to use it as a promotion for iGEM, to recruit new members to the teams as well as to                     increase the interest of iGEM and the competition.
Collaboration with Team BIOSINT México 2015
BIOSINT México has written a splendid guide for the iGEM Community regarding ethics for synthetic                     biology. We helped them by making a translated version, now available in Swedish. You can access the                     document in Swedish here .

Media and News
We have also seen it as our duty to engage with the media. We even reached those legendary five                     seconds of national news fame!
