Pretty fly for a nerd girl
An iGEM inspired cover “Pretty fly for a nerd girl” was written and performed by the LiU iGEM team.                     The cover was produced and mixed by Johan Blomqvist at AfterNine studios, for whom we are grateful.                     The song was originally performed by the famous band The Offspring as “Pretty fly for a white guy”.                     Work was also initiated to produce a music video for the song.
The aim of the video is to demonstrate the great community of iGEM where sharing of knowledge and                     information is central. Therefore, it was important for us to make the production of this video a                     collaboration, which we managed with a couple of iGEM-teams. The teams were; Macquaire Australia and                     Groningen, the Netherlands, who have recorded some of the clips to be used in the video.
However, we never got time to complete the work, but we aim to do so after the jamboree. Thereafter,                     our aim will be to use it as a promotion for iGEM, to recruit new members to the teams as well as to                     increase the interest of iGEM and the competition.
