Can I eat this?
A children's book about peanut allergy
One of the biggest problems with food allergy is the lack of knowledge and ignorance. To counter                     these issues LiU iGEM has written a book for children in the age 6-9.
The purpose of the book is to explain what a food allergy is and why some people can’t eat a certain                     type of food. It also includes differences between an allergy and an intolerance and what you can do                     to help someone who suffers from an anaphylactic shock.
