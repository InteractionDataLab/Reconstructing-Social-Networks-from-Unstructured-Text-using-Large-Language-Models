Logically, we looked for positions in the body where bacteria already live cooperatively with the body. Our research took us to the microbiome of the human digestive tract, where bacteria located in the gut facilitate digestion. This region appeared to present a strong possibility for the <I>in vivo</I> application of our system, as we could manipulate the gut microbiome to create an environment where our system could live symbiotically with other microorganisms in the human digestive tract.</P><P>Our manipulation of the microbiome would work in a manner similar to fecal transplants performed in patients suffering from infections of <I>Clostridium difficile</I><SUP>1</SUP>. <I>C. difficile</I> often presents in patients who have previously been treated with an antibiotic regime that imbalances the gut microbiome and causes a condition of severe diarrhea and colon inflammation. <I>C. difficile</I> is difficult to treat with antibiotics, but fecal transplants help to restore a healthy gut microbiome in patients by exposing it to the healthy microbiome of a donor<SUP>2</SUP>. We imagined that our project could be implemented in a similar manner. Placing our therapeutic system in the gut would subject it to conditions where it can optimally function. In order for the system to work, the therapeutic <I>E. coli</I> must be placed in an area where it can sense changes in glucose. Additionally, placement in the gut would allow the therapeutic bacteria to be in close proximity to SGLT1 and SGLT2 channels found in the intestines. From here, the tripeptide drug, QSP, will inhibit the ability of SGLT1 and SGLT2 to absorb some portion of glucose into the bloodstream after meal times.</P><P>After talking about our project with the public, and learning their reactions, we realized that procedures seem more acceptable in the laboratory than when proposed as a future treatment method to potential patients. Specifically, in a series of debates we held at our local Maker Faire and the New York Hall of Science, we were confronted with some in the public who felt that synthetic biology isn’t natural based on claims that it goes against everything from natural selection to religion. These discussion made us realize that it is important to take patient’s wishes and expectations into account when developing a treatment idea. To learn more about patient expectations and the viability of our treatment proposals, the iGEM team met with the head of endocrinology at Stony Brook University Hospital, Dr. Harold Carlson.</P><P>Meeting with Dr. Carlson made us aware of aspects of our proposed treatment that we had not previously noticed. We learned that medication transitions for and treatment compliance in diabetes patients are difficult periods. Type 2 diabetes patients are often reluctant to begin treatments with oral medications. This reluctance increases as the treatment becomes marginally more invasive and necessitates the injection of insulin. Therefore, patients, he suggested, may feel extreme reluctance and trepidation towards a procedure that can permanently alter their microbiome. He suggested that the treatment regime that was least invasive and labor intensive would have the highest success rate. Otherwise, patients would opt for other, safe, widely-available diabetic treatments that exist on the market to manage their condition.</P><P>Synthetic biologists have a commitment to implementing their systems in a way that is safe and prevents contamination with the environment. A relatively small amount is known about the functions of the microorganisms in the microbiome. Implementing new bacteria into this environment has the potential to eliminate favorable microorganisms whose functions are still unknown. For this reason, the effect that a new synthetic bacterium can have on the environment of the microbiome cannot be predicted. Additionally, Dr. Carlson broadened our thinking to help us imagine conditions where contamination involving our system could occur. His primary concern was contamination of the system between patients with diabetes, and people who do not have diabetes. Thus, if people without diabetes are exposed to the therapeutic bacteria, they risk disrupting their own natural microbiome and being subjected to unnecessary treatment. Additionally, there is the risk that the <I>E. coli</I> in the therapeutic system can be released into the environment after disposal from the human body. Here, there is a very small and unlikely chance that it can outcompete other bacteria in the environment for vital resources.</P><P>Based on this discussion, we knew we had to go back to the drawing board and redesign the administration of our system in order to make it safer and more appealing to patients. After much subsequent research, we found inspiration in the 2011 Slovenia iGEM team’s work, who were able to incorporate synthetic bacteria into the bloodstream by protecting them with an alginate encapsulation. The microcapsule can be delivered subcutaneously to the patient. This treatment delivery would be no more invasive than one insulin treatment, and has the potential to deliver treatment for an extended period of time in the same manner as the gut microbiome delivery system. A microcapsule delivery system may be considered a safer option because it localizes the therapeutic bacteria in its own environment instead of having it free in the body. Additionally, <I>E. coli</I> can be tagged for degradation by the immune system with the addition of specific antigens in the event that the integrity of the microcapsule membrane is ever compromised. The microcapsule itself can also be designed in a way that allows it to be degraded on command in the event that treatment is no longer needed or discontinued. These features allow the treatment to be less permanent and act as a safety switch when applied <I>in vivo</I>.</P><DIV class="cite"><H5 id="cow">Citations</H5><OL><LI>National Diabetes Statistics Report: Estimates of Diabetes and Its Burden in the United States (2014): n. pag.
