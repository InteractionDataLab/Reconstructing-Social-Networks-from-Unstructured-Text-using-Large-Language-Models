EnvZ Model
Sensor Design
Currently our engineered cells rely on the sensory histidine kinase, EnvZ, which senses for environmental osmolarity. In high osmolarity, EnvZ phosphorylates a transcriptional regulatory protein, OmpR, which then binds to the ompC promoter to begin the transcription of our tripeptides.
Glucose Sensor Model
Description
Osmolarity of the blood is affected by many factors besides just sugar levels so in the future we want to implement a sensor specifically for glucose. The lac operon has the ability to sense cAMP, which has an inverse relationship to environmental glucose concentration. To use this system, we will knock out the lacI repressor and replace lacZ with a tetR repressor. Separate from the operon, the tripeptides will be located under the control of a constitutively expressing Ptet promoter. In the case of a glucose spike (or hyperglycemia), cAMP levels would fall and transcription of the tetR repressor would drop. The lack of TetR would allow the PTet promoter to transcribe the tripeptides and regulate blood sugar.
