UGA
iGEM aimed to shift the most commonly used chassis in synthetic biology, E. Coli, to Methanococcus 
maripaludis, a model organism for methanogens. The rationale behind the shift in chassis stems from the 
inefficiency presented by E. coli. E. coli use expensive feedstocks such as sugars and oftentimes 
produces CO2, a waste product that wreaks havoc on the environment. The benefit of using methanogens 
can be observed in their autotrophic metabolism, as well as their ability to produce highly valued 
biochemicals such as methane.</P><P>Our study consisted of measuring the ribosome binding site specificity in Methanococcus maripaludis. 
UGA iGEM sent cells tagged with mCherry carrying over 30 point mutations in the ribosomal binding site, 
which we then measured with a Tecan plate reader. The methanogens were grown using mCherry just 
upstream of the ribosome binding site, were lysed, and resuspended in PIPES buffer, which then released 
mCherry proteins in the cell extracts. The cell extracts were then subjected to oxygenation in an effort to 
activate the fluorophore.</P><P>The 30 cell extracts (1A...10A, 1B...10B, 1C...10C) were subjected to an excitation wavelength of 562 
nm, an emission wavelength of 650 nm, an excitation bandwidth of 40 nm, and an emission bandwidth of 
75 nm. 10 flashes were used with a gain of 50 using a dichroic 630 mirror to measure the following levels:</P><P>Once the relative fluorescence levels were measured, a BCA protein assay was then used to measure
the protein concentrations. The standard curve was produced using absorbance and concentration from 
the BCA protocol. A standard curve was generated, which allowed for a fluorescence/protein 
concentration graph to be made.</P><P>The absorbances were then measured for all thirty cell extracts. Those values were entered into the 
standard curve, which yielded the following data:</P><P>From obtaining the concentrations in each of the wells, we plotted the fluorescence against the
concentration in an effort to see a correlation.</P></DIV><DIV id="footer"><UL><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook">Home</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Team" id="home1">Team</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Description" id="project1">Project Description</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Results" id="project3">Project Results</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Parts" id="parts3">Team Parts</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Modeling" id="home3">Modeling</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Notebook" id="home2">Notebook</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Collaborations" id="outreach1">Collaborations</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Practices" id="outreach2">Human Practices</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Stony_Brook/Attributions" id="home4">Attributions</A></LI></UL><A href="#" id="toTop">Back To Top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
