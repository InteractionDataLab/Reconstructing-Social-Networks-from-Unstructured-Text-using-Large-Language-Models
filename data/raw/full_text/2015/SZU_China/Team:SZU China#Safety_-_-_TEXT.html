About Our Lab
1.Chassis and Organism
The chassis organism is human bladder cancer cell line 5637 and T24.The organism used for control group are Hela（cervical carcinoma cell) and HFC (human fiber epithelial cell).
Experiment environment
We handle the biological material in Ultra clean bench and Cell Culture Laboratory. For protective equipment, for example, we use a board to protect ourselves from the X-ray when we are doing gel extraction under the gel imager.
Rules and Regulations on safety
1.Link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution
The college of Biology and Life Science has clear regulation about the safety of biology labs including the pre-training courses on safety manipulation before experiment in the labs,docunmenting record in the labs etc.We have Laboratory And Equipment Department at our institution which is responsible for our biological safety.The officers have inspected our laboratory and gave us suggestions about biosafety, which were already fulfilled as request. Regulations of laboratory safety and environmental management of Shenzhen University
2.Regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories
Safety management method for gene engineering in China
Risk of Project
1.Potential risk and solutions
If the experiment did not proceed carefully that result in the leak of the culture medium, the bacteria may breed at a considerable speed especially for the human cell culture medium and serum we would use in our lab.Thus it will contaminate the lab.To prevent this,we instruct every student to learn the lab regulations and they are asked to check the vessels and dispose the waste well before exiting from the lab. Referring to the case that people carry the extraneous bacteria into the lab without disinfection, we have strict hygiene standard which requires all entrants to wear the lab coat and disinfect before experiment.
2.future work and risk solutions
If the system develops well in the future,it could be injected into human body to cure the bladder cancer. When doing so,though our system won't hurt normal cells,the translation of effector gene before termination codon may cause burden to normal cells.To reduce these risk, when we designed the mutation site,we choose the site as far as possible close to the front.
