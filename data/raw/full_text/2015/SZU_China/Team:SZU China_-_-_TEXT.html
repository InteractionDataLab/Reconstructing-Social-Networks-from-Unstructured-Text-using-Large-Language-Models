Bladder Cancer Sniper
Combine Biological Unnatural Amino Acid（UAA）Orthogonal
genectical system with logic "AND" gate gene circuit
to kill bladder cancer cells precisely
Quick View
Why is sniper?
Sniper means to shoot the target precisely. Distinguish from the conventional therapy such as radiotherapy and chemical therapy, the synthesizing system we construct target bladder cancer cell specifically without harming the healthy cells.

Background
Nowadays,bladder cancer is one of the urologic tumours in the world. However, the conventional therapy have focused on mass cell  killing without specific targeting. Therefore, targeted and specific therapeutic strategy turns out to be a promising approach to the treatment of bladder cancer.

AND GATE
AND gate is the synthesizing gene circuit which only operates in bladder cancer cells that behaves as a logical AND gate on two input promoters. It activates an output only when both promoters are capable of driving gene expression in the tested cell lines.

Orthogonal System
Parallel and independent orthogonal system is one of the foundations of synthetic biology with no or little cross with the natural biological system. The orthogonal system enable the unnatural amino acids to generate protein without affecting other parts'work.

Result
The result shows that the expression of the output reporter gene being detected in bladder cancer cells were significantly higher that of other cell types, which suggests our circuit can selectively perform its function in bladder cancer cells. Our orthogonal system is also verified to work in high efficiency since it only demonstrated significant activity in bladder cancer cells with Ack.
