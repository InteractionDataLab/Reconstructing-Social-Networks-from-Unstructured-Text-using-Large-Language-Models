Basic parts
New Basic Part : hUPll
BBa_K1722000
hUPll is a bladder tissue-specific promoter being found in human urothelium. Uroplakin II (UPII) has been characterized as a bladder tissue-specific protein and the expression of uroplakin II was found to be limited to bladder-derived cells. 2015 SZU-iGEM use hUPII to drive the expression of the therapeutic genes(such as p21 and Bax) so that the gene is expressed only in bladder cells and systematic toxicity is minimized.
Another Basic Part : hTERT
BBa_K1722002
hTERT, which is short for human telomerase reverse transcriptase, is recognized as a cancer specific promoter for various cancers. Researches show that hTERT promoters are activated in tumor cells that are telomerase positive while being inhibited in normal cells that are telomerase negative, which indicates that hTERT promoter may specifically target at tumor cells.
Another Basic Part : tRNA
BBa_K1722004
This tRNA gene can produce an tRNA with CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Only with this tRNA can the mRNA chain with UAG terminator being fully translated. The aminoacyl-tRNA came from barchaebacteria, and it is generally applied to unnatural amino acid orthogonal system.
Another Basic Part : shTERT
BBa_K1722001
shTERT is short for super human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is improved from hTERT promoter( BBa_K404106 ), a cancer specific promoter. Three base pairs in hTERT promoter were mutated and the drive efficiency of the promoter was verified to be increased significantly.
Another Basic Part : Rluc
BBa_K1722005
The Rluc was improved from BBa_J52012 ,which was being amber mutated.It can be transcripted to an mRNA chain with one codon being mutated to stop codon UAG. It cannot be fully expressed in natural biology system but can be used as a reporter gene in unnatural amino acid orthogonal system which has a tRNA whose anticodon can pair with the stop codon.
Another Basic Part : SV40
BBa_K1722006
Different from the SV40 promoter distributed by iGEM13_Freiburg( BBa_K1150011 ), the promoter we are submitting this year includes an enhancer sequence(74bp) upstream of the promoter gene. It is a widely used strong promoter that can improve the gene expression level of many host cells. the therapeutic gene out.
