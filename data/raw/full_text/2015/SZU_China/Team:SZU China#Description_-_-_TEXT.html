Improved parts
shTERT
BBa_K1722001
shTERT is short for super human telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is improved from hTERT promoter( BBa_K404106 ), a cancer specific promoter. Three base pairs in hTERT promoter were mutated and the drive efficiency of the promoter was verified to be increased significantly.
Rluc(with TAG)
BBa_K1722005
The Rluc was improved from BBa_J52012 ,which was being amber mutated.It can be transcripted to an mRNA chain with one codon being mutated to stop codon UAG. It cannot be fully expressed in natural biology system but can be used as a reporter gene in unnatural amino acid orthogonal system which has a tRNA whose anticodon can pair with the stop codon.
SV40(with Enhancer)
BBa_K1722006
Different from the SV40 promoter distributed by iGEM13_Freiburg( BBa_K1150011 ), the promoter we are submitting this year includes an enhancer sequence(74bp) upstream of the promoter gene. It is a widely used strong promoter that can improve the gene expression level of many host cells. the therapeutic gene out.
