Composite parts
New Composite Part : SV40+Rluc
BBa_K1722012
SV40 is a strong promoter with enhancer in the upstream. Rluc is a widely used reporter gene which can produce Renilla Luciferase. However, different from normal Rluc reporter gene, this one is being amber mutated and the mRNA chain being transcriped out has a terminator inside it. In this way, the whole chain of Renilla Luciferase cannot be translated in natural condition. Only with two other composite parts of our project (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722010) can Renilla Luciferase protein being produced.
Another Composite Part : hUPⅡ+AckRS
BBa_K1722007
hUPⅡ is a bladder specific promoter that can only drive gene expression in urothelium cells. As the output gene of this recombinant plasmid, AckRS can produce an RNA synthetase which can achieve the attachment of Ack and tRNA. This composite part will perform its function together with two other plasmids (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722012)
Another Composite Part : hTERT+tRNA
BBa_K1722010
hTERT is recognized as a cancer specific promoter for various cancers. The tRNA that is expressed by tRNA gene has CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Together with BBa_K1722007 and BBa_K1722012, this genetic circuit can specifically recognize bladder cancer cells and express the therapeutic gene out.
Another Composite Part : shTERT+GFP
BBa_K1722009
shTERT is a cancer specific promoter improved from hTERT promoter. We use GFP as the output reporter gene of our plasmid. When shTERT promoter is activated, sfGFP is produced and be oxidized to fluoresce. By inserting this plasmid into T24 and 5637, two lines of bladder cancer cells, we are able to acquire sfGFP. Green fluorescent light is detected using fluorescent microscope. This indicates that shTERT promoter is able to be activated inside bladder cancer cells.
Another Composite Part : shTERT+tRNA
BBa_K1722011
shTERT is a cancer specific promoter improved from hTERT promoter. shTERT promoter. The tRNA that is expressed by tRNA gene has CUA as its anticodon, which can pair with the amber mutated stop codon UAG in the mRNA chain to continue the translation of the amber mutated mRNA. Together with BBa_K1722007 and BBa_K1722012, this genetic circuit can specifically recognize bladder cancer cells and express the therapeutic gene out.
Another Composite Part : SV40+Rluc
BBa_K1722012
SV40 is a well-known strong promoter achieved from 2015 iGEM submission kit. Rluc is a widely used reporter gene which can produce Renilla Luciferase. However, different from normal Rluc reporter gene, this one is being amber mutated and the mRNA chain being transcriped out has a terminator inside it. In this way, the whole chain of Renilla Luciferase cannot be translated in natural condition. Only with two other composite parts of our project (BBa_K1722010& BBa_K1722010) can Renilla Luciferase protein being produced.
