April 2nd - April 23rd
To discuss the decision of team project: CANCER SNIPER BLADDER
April 28th - June 20th
Finished the project system in shuttle vector
June 26th- June 26th
In order to verify the function of our UAA orthogonal system,We constructed the whole system into three plasmids,and then we transfected the three-plasmid-system in T24 bladder cancer cells.We got a good result in Rluc(with amber mutation) detection.
June 30th- June 30th
Improved the original BioBrick TERT (BBa_K1722001)
July 10th- July 25th
In order to verify the function of hTERT and hUPII,We constructed the whole system into two plasmids,and then we transfected the two-plasmid-system in 5637 bladder cancer cells.We got a good result in Luc(with amber mutation) detection.At the same time,we transfected the two-plasmid-system in HFC and Hela to build controll groups.
July 12th- July 12th
We greeted Tito Jankowski visiting SZU-iGEM,who is the world's first bio hackerspaces BioCurious founder.
July 18th- July 18th
Began to distribute questionnaires Online 2015SZU-iGEM Questionnaire
July 28th- July 28th
We distributed our paper questionnaiers to many places.For instence,People's Hospital of Guangdong Province,Shenzhen Hospital and Genitourinary Center of Peking University Hospital.Via our offorts,we got many important data for our project.
July 30th- July 30th
Propaganda synthetic biology and iGEM to all students at the Cultural Festival of Collage of Life Sciences Shenzhen University.
August 7th- August 15th
Finished some BioBricks:shTERT+GFP Composite (BBa_K1722009) , TERT part (BBa_K1722002) , shTERT part (BBa_K1722001) ,hUPII part (BBa_K1722000) and Rlu part (BBa_K1722005) .
August 16th- August 25th
Added GFP(with amber mutation) to the two plasmid system, and transfected the system in 5637 and T24 bladder cancer cells.
August 18th- August 26th
Finished some BioBricks:SV40(en) part (BBa_K1722006) , SV40+Rlu Composite (BBa_K1722013) , tRNA part (BBa_K1722004) , SV40(en)+Rlu Composite (BBa_K1722012)
August 19th- August 19th
LZU-iGEM and SZU-iGEM made a whole day of cooperative communication.
August 23th- August 23th
The GFP gene transfection test was successful, and it proved that THE BLADDER CANCER SNIPER SYSTERM was functional.
August 26th- September 10th
Finished the rest of BioBricks:ShTERT+tRNA Composite (BBa_K1722011) ,hTERT+tRNA Composite (BBa_K1722010） ，hUPll+AckRS Composite (BBa_K1722007)
September 2th- September 13th
Prepared wiki,continued the system verification experiment
September 3th- September 15th
Finished collecting BioBricks data, and edited in the wiki. https://2015.igem.org/Team:SZU_China/Basic_parts
September 5th- September 5th
we visited the Shenzhen Cancer Rehabilitation Association,and made a thorough understanding about specific situation of cancer patients.
September 8th- September 15th
In order to prove the system's function and specificity, we made second GFP transfection test.The result indicated the system has a good function and specificity.
September 11th- September 11th
According to our experience, we convened cancer patients,and made a cancer patients communication,Which purpose is to give patients confidence and improve the difficult situation of group's treatment in china.
