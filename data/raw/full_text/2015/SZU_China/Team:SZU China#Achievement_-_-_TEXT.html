Judging Criteria
In the past 9 months, we have gone through brainstorming, experimental design, biobrick combination, system verification, human practice and wiki making, ect. Through our hard work, our project has been greatly developed and we are fully prepared for the Giant Jamboree. We have submitted 12 biobricks and they are transiently transfected into different cell lines to verify the working efficiency of our system. What’s more, we performed our human practice with Cancer Mutual Aid Association, Shenzhen Sencond People’s Hospital and Moonbay Primary School. We also cooperate with Nankai and LZU-China. We believe we deserve Gold Medal since we have met all the requirements for it.
Standard Biological Part registration
We have designed and constructed 12 parts, including 6 basic parts and 6 composite parts. Among all this parts, three of them are improved from previously existing Biobrick Part or Device. All of these parts were well documented on the part registry pages. They are listed as follows:
Part Number

hUPII(BBa_K1722000) is well documented in the registry and accepted. It is the highest quality basic part of our team and it deserves the Best New Basic Part.
hUPII+AckRS(BBa_K1722007) is well documented in the registry and accepted. It is the highest quality composite part of our team and it deserves the Best New Composite Part.
Human practice outside the lab
As we concerned, human practice is not only associated with the publicity of synthetic biology but also what significance we can achieve basing on our project. This year SZU-iGEM team has conducted a survey and interviewed professor Mr Caizhiming to find that the patient’s psychological state would largely influence the process of cure.Referring to the Group psychotherapy, we organized a meetup and invited a few veterans on defending against cancer for the cancer patients to heal their isolation. From the meetup the patients learned the significance of a stable psychological state and receive care and encouragement from us. When seeing the patients from sobbing to burst into laughter, we felt obliged to make a difference in their lives.

Education and public engagement
As for the education,SZU-iGEM team visited primary school students this year to illustrate the basic knowledge about synthetic biology and our project. It’s surprising for us to see their strong interest regarding to cancer,biology that some students came with more questions to ask after the lecture. Inspired and influenced by students’ passion, we decided to undertake to be their mentors on biological research and personal development. In terms of public engagement, we participated the Cultural Festival of Life and science in which exhibited our projects to the university students. Nevertheless we visited cancer patients in the hospital where we share our concerns and our project to extend hope for them.

Judging
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2015 Judging form .
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki , and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Improved part Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. This part must not come from your team's 2015 range of part numbers.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
