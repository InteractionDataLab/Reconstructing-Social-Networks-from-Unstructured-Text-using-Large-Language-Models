2015SZU-iGEM Project Questionnaire & Analysis
We are the Shenzhen University iGEM team.In this year, our project is the 《Synthesizing genetic circuit based on Unnatural Amino Acid orthogonal system to cure bladder cancer》, which is about to construct the gene circuit to detect and kill bladder cancer cells accurately without killing the normal cells. We sincerely hope that this survey could help us obtain more data and information to further our research. Here are our conclusions.
The main purpose of synthetic biology is to restructure the existing functional components into simple biological system.Have you ever heard of the concept of synthetic biology?
Do you know any application in terms of the synthetic biology used in medical field?
Analysis
We know from the 4th and 5th questions,people know little about synthetic biology. Therefore,we did many things to improve the situation,such as propaganda synthetic biology iGEM,and carried a lecture at Shenzhen Yueliangwan elementary school, to let more people know about and be interested in synthetic biology
ShenZhen University iGEM team is doing a project about gene therapy which will have a great prospect for the treatment of bladder cancer.How do you think of it?
Analysis
We have 93% of the supporters in 543 people, which is a great inspiration to our project and will be very good to promote the in-depth study of our subject.
￼
Compared with traditional treatment, gene therapy has the advantage to specifically detect and kill cancer cells without any harm to normal cells.If gene therapy develops more effective for the treatment of bladder cancer,will you choose gene therapy in the future?
Analysis
In 543 people,440 people are very supportive of our team project, which gives us a lot of confidence. We believe that what we do is worthy of recognition and meaningful.
