This is the first time Nankai University iGEM team asked our team for a help.They asked us to join their iShare platform,in which all iGEM teams could find the resource and material. We shared the resources and materials through an excel,which includes all the Biobricks and cells information about our project.  We strongly support the iShare platform created by Nankai iGEM.Fortunately,SZU-iGEM is the first team to share information in the iGEM teams. We have only one purpose to join Nankai iGEM iShare,which is to make our best efforts to help each team,so that we can share resources with iShare as soon as possible. We helped NanKai University iGEM with the resource sharing of iShare.In return,they gave us these badges as a reward.
