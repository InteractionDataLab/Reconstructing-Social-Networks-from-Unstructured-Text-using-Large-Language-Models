OMG!! Pao Pao is the most “Trying to be Badai Girl” Hahaha*Badai means fashionable, beauty, and 

cool person. At first, I think she is a kind of calm person, buat after that,,, haha. Beside her ambition 

to be badai (using hair extension, badai eyebrow, red lips, etc, i can’t mention all because too many 

things), she is a kind of people who always imrove herself by studying (Harlin’s quotes). <B>Jessica Lius (Jelly)</B><B>Medicine 2014</B>

also often ask other member to lap her. Other members are usually blurred when jelly began to 

show signs of going lap. Haha. Peace, Jelly ^^<B>Yudisthira Oktaviandie (Odie)</B><B>Biology 2014</B>

Odie is the smiling person. His mouth shape has been designed in such way to always smile. Odie 

also is the most expressive when photographed than others. Even so, Odie was the most 

communicative than others, I mean he can explain things that difficult to undestand become 

understandable. <B>Yolla Miranda (Yolla)</B><B>Chemical Engineering 2013</B>

Yolla is a hardworker person. Her life principle is say no to unproductive time, WORK WORK WORK !! 

Hehe. In this team, Yolla responsible in fund raising, finance, and correspondence. Oh ya, I think 

Yolla is the most fashionable person than others. <B>Faustina Martha (Faus)</B><B>Bioengineering 2013</B>

day, she talked about Turkey, Turkish guy, movies, or soap operas Turkey. In this team, Faus is 

responsible in modelling and also helped human practice. <B>Alfiani Guntari Mahadewi</B><B>Bioengineering 2013</B>

person. She is responsible for Human Practice. <B>Amanda Fauzea Ghaissani</B><B>Public Health 2013</B>
