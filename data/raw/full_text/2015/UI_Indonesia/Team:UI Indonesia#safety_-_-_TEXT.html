Biosafety Assesment (FTA)
In our project, we have a principle that safety is always come first. We do concern about how if our bacteria come out to the environment and make an infertility epidemic into people when the product is already used. In order to resolve that issue, we analyze likelihood that could happen and find the assessment for each likelihood that might appear. To make our analyze easier, we use a systematic chart based on FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) methods and we hypothises the problem that could happen based on literature review and possibility that we found when we experiment our product
From that chart, we could see that possibility that moght happen and the assessment that we could do in order to resolve the problem. Below is the table that explain assessment that we did:
