Modelling of Bacterial Contraception
Toggle switch is a gene synthetic network that was discovered and constructed in Escherichia coli by Tim Gerdner, Charles Cantor, and Jim Collins. Naturally, toggle switch gene synthetic network found in lambda bacteriophage for regulate its lytic and lysogenic cycle. In synthetic biology, toggle switch use for regulating bistability of two expression system by orientating to one expression system depends on strength of the promoter and inducer or repressor concentration.
Logic for toggle switch gene synthetic network was described in picture below.
