Disease Alarm
When Matchmaker Comes to Help
This project is aiming at using synthetic biological engineering bacteria,
connected with the aptamers, to make engineering bacteria able to detect
the macromolecules,thus making detection more accurate, precise and
convenient, which leads crowd-creating medical industry.

Project
Technology & Product
biological detecting method has the following advantages.
One is that the cost of microorganism is much lower, and it
reproduces efficiently. On the other hand, the genetic circuit, which is modified based
on the synthetic biology, is able to amplify the micro signals,
and improve the accuracy.
