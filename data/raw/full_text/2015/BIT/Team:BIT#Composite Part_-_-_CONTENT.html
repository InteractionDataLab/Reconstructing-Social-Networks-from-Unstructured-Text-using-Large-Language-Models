        We really like this composite part, whose part name is &quot;BBa_K1651000&quot;. 
        For it really make everyone begin to think carefully that what synthetic
        can do for our life as well as how can it change our life. 
        This year, we aim at detecting macromolecule by synthetic ways. Once we
        decided to carry out our project, there are so many problems and considerations
        that we must solve or think about. Nowadays, we already have many methods
        to prevent us from the most serious disease. The most advanced techniques
        will make confirmation in only several days or even several hours while
        detecting Hepatitis B, AIDS and many other infectious disease. 
        However, there are still wide areas, especially in the developing country, 
        which need some new kind of detecting methods for the device now widely used 
        is not portable enough. What's more, it is also not available with a low cost.

    </P><P>
        So all the considerations comes to one termination that is whether there 
        is a method, which has a low cost as well as portability.
        We are convinced that by optimizing the natural circuit existing in P. Aeruginosa.
        Like the real circuit, we use the LasIR and RhlIR system to construct a &quot;sensor+amplifier&quot;
        in the E. Coli. With the small molecule PAI1 and PAI2 transformed plying between the sensor and
        amplifier, the signal of the fluorescence will be greatly enhanced.
        This part named BBa_K1651000 is exactly the &quot;amplifier&quot; of the system, which can be significantly
         activated by levels of small molecules (PAI1) can be satisfied.
        The following is our data coming from Laboratory for Bioseparation and Bioanalysis.
            </P><P>
        From the data above, it is obvious that the amplifier could be induced by trace of
        PAI1 which is cataloged by the LasI promoted by the pBAD. So we have enough confidence to make
         this part a powerful tool for any &quot;sensor&quot; which use pBAD as its promoter.
