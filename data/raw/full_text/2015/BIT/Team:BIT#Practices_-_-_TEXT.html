01 From July to August
Communication With BIT-China
By Li Kunjie
Communication With BIT-China
From July to August in the summer of 2015, the iGEM teams from Beijing Institute of Technology, which are BIT team and BIT-China team, carried on several communications about the project, the work, the experimental program and iGEM matters. We have discussed about problems in each other's project and helped each other to solve the practical difficulties encountered by both sides.
The main content of communications between the two teams:
1. Sharing of some experimental apparatus and the experimental reagent.
2. The improvement and optimization of experimental skills and experimental methods.
3. Existing problems of our projects, optimization and suggestion.
4. Team building and interpretation of iGEM rules.
5. Establish the international Human Practice alliance with other schools around the world, and expand the international communication among the iGEM teams.
This year, the communication and cooperation between the two teams are the most comprehensive and in-depth since BIT participated in iGEM, aiming at realizing the goal of working together for better results.
07 September
Symposium with hospital and enterprise
The symposium with China PLA General Hospital
Time: September 07, 2015
Personnel: Zhao Fan, Yang Wei, Wen Zhaosen
Location: China PLA General Hospital, or 301 Hospital
On the afternoon of September 14, as the representatives of BIT team, we have a symposium with Duan Jinyan, the supervisor technician of the Clinical laboratory of 301 hospital and a doctor of biological chemistry. We found many advantages and disadvantages of our project from this symposium, which plays an important role in guiding us to carry out the work. We have learned that the detection methods used in the clinic to detect samples nowadays use optical methods more often, which is efficient in large quantities. After understanding our project, Dr. Duan proposed some valuable suggestions both in the experiment and application.
Current problems:
It is difficult to precisely control the time of bacteria revival and the time of adding sample.
The actual test sample is blood. The condition of blood is more complex, and difficult to control.
Prospect:
Time control and other issues can be explored and verified through a large number of experiments and finally be improved and optimized.
This technology can avoid the cost of purchasing expensive instruments. As a POCT detection instrument, it has a certain prospect for development. It can be portably used in remote mountainous areas because of the traffic inconvenience. It can also be used at home in the detection of the tumor markers, such as Alpha fetal protein, CA724, CA15-3, or the early detection of Hepatitis B virus.
15 September
The symposium with Beijing ShingSun Technology Co. Ltd
The symposium with Beijing ShingSun Technology Co. Ltd
Time: September 15, 2015
Personnel: Li Kunjie, Yuan Honglin
Location: Conference room of Beijing ShingSun Technology Co. Ltd
ShingSun is a modern production enterprise, which owns independent intellectual property rights by independent innovation and development, with the goal of producing suitable domestic and foreign modern clinical laboratory instrument. Firstly, we introduced the project, the design and the function of our hardware. After understanding the whole project, the Chairman Fu from ShingSun provided valuable advice for our shortcomings, and a new insight, which is Precision Medicine. Our current detection is based on the protein level, if the disease detection can be successfully achieved from the gene level in the next step, this will be a big step forward in the field of Precision Medicine.
Current problems:
The accuracy of protein detection is too low. Gene chip is not mature in clinic.
The persons who do not receive training feel it difficult to operate.
Prospect:
It would be better if we use microfluidic device and the develop our device toward POCT; We can set one or a few kinds of disease as the detection object, and focus on the faster, more accurate and more convenient detection. We can set small hospitals and clinics which cannot afford large instruments as our target client, and monitor the diseases fast and cheaply.

Twitter/Weibo
Online Contact
This year we have our formal social networking platforms. The one is Twitter through which we can communicate with the worldwide iGEMers. The other one is Sina Weibo and it is mainly for Chinese iGEMers for Weibo is a popular social tool in China. Now we have 129 followers in Twitter and 23 followers in Sina Weibo. These two platforms are useful for us to share our project with other teams and the public, and we can communicate with other teams, such as ATOMS_Türkiye_iGEM, Trinity iGEM, Colombia iGem 2015, USTC_iGEM, iGEM-UESTC, iGEM LZU-China and so on.

Survey
Survey
According to this, the general public basically understand the early disease detection. It also reflects that they pay close attention to their physical health. We put forward the following suggestions: the reports for early disease detection should be increased in the network, television, newspapers, magazines and other media, and the propaganda are supposed to be strengthened for the early disease detection, so as to let the public further understand the early disease detection and pay more attention to their own health. In addition, if the home disease detection apparatus come out, out of the care for the body, people will surely buy such apparatus, which will make it convenient for us to examine the body.
With the faster pace of life, there will be a huge change in the physical examination. This also indicates that a more convenient and efficient new physical examination will be welcomed and loved. At the same time, after the birth of the home disease detection apparatus, because of the reduced detection cost and the shortened detection time, it will be highly welcomed in the crowd.
From these data, we can roughly know the deepest public concern, which is that the results may be rough, and not trustworthy. In the hospital physical examination, although it will take some time and money, its results can be trusted. And due to the constraints of time, space and size of the home disease detection equipment, it cannot let users completely be convinced of this. This will give researchers a problem, which is how to ensure the test results are the same or has little difference with the hospital physical examination’s results. If these problems can be solved, this kind of home instruments will certainly be popular among people.
