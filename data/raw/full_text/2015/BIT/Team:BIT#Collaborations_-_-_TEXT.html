Collaborations
1. USTC
USTC and BIT focus on measurement this year and we face the same difficulty so that we set up the collaboration for dealing with the problem. We are really glad that we can have collaborations in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling.
Process
Both of teams took part in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July and both of us are interested in each other’s projects. In the middle of August, USTC attended the Conference of China iGEMer Committee in PKU (Beijing, China) and we had a chance to communicate the details of our collaborations face to face. In this meeting, we determine that we can cooperate in the aspect of experiment, hardware and modeling. After that, we assist each other by internet and make some progresses. Ultimately, USTC help BIT to build a more perfect modeling and BIT assist USTC accomplish the experiment of bacteria freeze-drying. Because both of us had demand for hardware, we all put forward some comments and advice for each other to make a better hardware.
Details
The Experiment of Bacteria Freeze-drying
Purpose
We all hope the ideal product could apply to reality. The method of bacterial powder help the idea come true result from following features:
1) Portative: it will be easier for hardware, like detecting device which is made by BIT or CACCI which is made by USTC, to carry bacteria.
2) Easy-to-store: the condition for storing bacterial powder is simple to achieve, that makes it convenient for users to use the product.
3) Recoverable: the bacteria will recover within normal water solution so that it will not bring extra burden to the users.
Protocol
1) Strain
Reserve it at -20℃.
2) Preparation of culture medium
Prepare: tryptone 5g, yeast extract 5g, NaCl 30g, glycerol 3g, Na2HPO4·12H2O 12.5g, KH2PO4 1g, and add distilled water 1L ;then split the liquid in different test tubes, and 10 ml for each tube ; sterilize these tubes for 20min at 121℃; save.
3) Other reagents and equipment
Skim milk; Eppendorf liquid gun, tube (Ф15mm x 100mm), IEC CL31 high-speed refrigerated centrifuge, low temperature refrigerator, common refrigerator, FD-1A-50 freeze dryer, 3ml colorimetric tube, CL-1 magnetic stirring apparatus, BHP9511 type water toxicity analyzer, SHZ- 82 thermostatic oscillator.
4) Preparation of freeze drying protective agent
Due to use the higher concentration of skim milk, milk is not dissolved so well, and after the static, there is some precipitation, so the lower concentration of skim milk is chosen, of which the mass fraction is 12%. The mass fraction of the solution of NaCl is 2.0%
5) Preparation of luminescent bacteria freeze drying preparation
Inoculate the bacteria, which was stored hypothermal, on fresh culture medium,  undertake constant temperature oscillation culture until the logarithmic growth phase at 22℃, and the light is more bright; centrifugate the 5ml of culture with the speed of 5000r / min at 4℃ for 10min, the supernatant is discarded; with the addition of the equal volume of prepared frozen drying protective agent, heavy suspension is done in the bacterium strain; split them in different test tubes, and 1 ml for each tube; do pre-freezing at -70℃, then freeze and dry; after finishing drying these tubes, seal them with sealing compound. At last, reserve them at -20℃.
Modeling
USTC give us plenty of advice about modeling, especially in model 1 of our modeling. Model 1 is about the experiment of glycopeptide incubation and the experiment of competitive inhibition. The details is shown in “Biology-Model”.
2. Global Union Survey
The Global Union Survey led by BIT, BIT-China, CGU_Taiwan and Stockholm contains 11 teams from Asia, Europe and America. The members includes Berlin (Berlin), BIT (Beijing), BIT-China (Beijing), Brasil_USP (São Paulo), CGU_Taiwan (Taoyuan City), CUHK (Hong Kong), Leicester (Leicester), Stockholm (Stockholm), Tianjin (Tianjin), Toulouse (Toulouse), UCL (London).
Process
The idea was put forward in 2015 iGEM Asian Conference in NCTU (Hsinchu, Taiwan) at the end of July. The initial team consists of BIT, BIT-China, CGU-Taiwan and CUHK. We found that we can conduct a global survey which can achieve that all of teams can share the data about their own project from different areas. The idea attracted Stockholm’s attention and they brought the teams from Europe and America in at the beginning of August. During August, all the teams made efforts to collect the questionnaires from public and we processed data at the beginning of September. Ultimately, each team can gain the different data from other 10 regions and it’s useful for every project to improve their world-wide adaptability.
Details

Additional Information：
Synthetic biology is an emerging branch of biological sciences, and has been making substantial progress over the past few years. The core notion of traditional biology is to study the internal structure of creature through dissection, while the synthetic biology is totally the other way around by building up components from the basic elements. The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to set up artificial biosystem ad make it function as a circuit.
