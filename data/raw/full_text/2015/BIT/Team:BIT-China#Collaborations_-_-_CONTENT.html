				This year we collaborated with BNU-CHINA team and held a meeting on July 11<SUP>st</SUP>, 2015. During the meeting we exchanged our ideas and discussed on our projects. Finally, we confirmed our collaboration relationship.
				Because most of BNU-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM, after the discussion, we decided to help them for parts of their gene circuits. Meanwhile, we had some difficulties in modeling and expressing functional gene <I>NhaA</I> and <I>NhaB</I>, so they offered help to solve these problems.
			</P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.1 meeting with BNU-China</P><P>
				We helped them finish the light regulation system (Pcons+B0034+<I>PcyA</I>+B0034+<I>ho1</I>). In this system, <I>Pcons</I> is one of the constitutive promoters (from BBa_J23100 to BBa_J23119) which can be used to tune the expression level of expressing part and what we chose was J23100. B0034 is a kind of strong ribosome binding sites (RBS). <I>PcyA</I> and <I>ho1</I> are two requisite genes which are required for the transformation from heme into phycocyanobilin (PCB). <I>Ho1</I> will oxidize the heme group and then generate biliverdin IX alpha, and <I>PcyA</I> converts biliverdin IX alpha into PCB. 
			</P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.2 Gene circuits of light regulation system</P><P>
				Overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR) was used to finish their gene circuits. However, there were secondary structures in this part. So we could not get the part at first. Then we changed DNA polymerase Pfu to Primer STAR, which performs better than Pfu. Finally the light regulation system was constructed successfully.
			</P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.3 The construction result of light regulation system</P><P>In this period, we also had some discussions about experiments and modeling face to face. Through these discussions, we learnt more about each other and made progress together.</P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.4 Discussions with BNU-China</P><H2 style="float:left;margin-left:10px;clear:right;">BNU_China for BIT_China</H2><P style="clear:left;"><A href="

				BNU-China mainly helps us to establish a model of substance changes during the pH regulation stage. Specifically, they build a model to link six chemical reaction processes together, all of which are controlled by switch in pH. With change in pH, main chemical reactions will change subsequently. We provided them the conditions and equations of each chemical reaction stage, and they are responsible for the realization of the equations and the whole regulation process.

The difficulty we BIT-China meet is how to connect the six groups of chemical reactions together with the switch in pH, how to identify the reaction time and the results of each chemical reaction, and how to draw an image to reflect the pH variation as function of time. Because some members of BNU-China are majoring in physics, math, computer science and chemistry, they have much experience in differential equations, application of MATLAB and designing computer programs. With these resources, they have helped us solve our problems successfully.

The description of variables are written as followed:</P><P style="text-align:center;">Table 1.

	After several times of discussion with us, BNU-China understood the background of our modeling part and the problems they were about to settle. Meanwhile, they helped us to find some bugs in modeling, such as the inconsistency of some variable values in each group of equations, and the problem that parameters of some equations don’t accord with the fact. 

	First of all, BNU-China adjusted a series of independent variables and corrected the parameters. Then they found the solution of the equations by applying the Runge-Kutta Method. The method could be used in differential equation system in different dimensions with high efficiency. According to concentration of hydroxyl ion in equation ABCDE groups, pH of each equation was obtained and was used to judge the termination condition. In equation C and equation F, concentration of specific substances were used to stop the conditions. The initial value of each equation group was the terminal value of the last equation group. By this way they achieved the whole cyclic process and finally got dynamic image of pH(Fig.5).
</P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig. 5 The dynamic change of pH during the regulation process</P><P>The initial concentration of OH<SUP>-</SUP> is 0.2×10-6, and the initial pH is higher than 7.0, so the whole reaction starts from Group A, and the reactions are in the order of Group A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C, D, E, F.</P><H2>○ The detection of protein NhaA and NhaB by BNU_China.</H2><P>
	BIT-China’s project this year is to regulate the pH in fermentation environment and to strengthen the competence of microorganism to survive in both acid and alkali. Therefore we want to express two kinds of membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB. Considering the fact that membrane proteins are particularly hard to express and detect, BNU_China helped us to establish this part. To this end, they reviewed amounts of relevant articles and consulted several professors in this field, on which basis they tried various protocols to express, purify and detect NhaA as well as NhaB. 

Initially BNU-China did the SDS-PAGE of the whole protein of bacteria, and the result was not as expected. The first time of result is not shown here. To put it in detail, they centrifuged 5 mL bacterium solution under overnight shake culture at 4 °C, 6000 rpm for 10 minutes, which was boiled for 10 minutes, then protein loading buffer was added. Afterwards they did the SDS-PAGE of the mixture with the running gel concentration 12%.  
Because the whole cell was too stick, BNU-China couldn’t make an accurate estimation from the result, but anyway there was no sign of expression of the objective proteins whose molecular weight was about 46 kDa.
Then they tried a normal SDS-PAGE of the homogenate and supernatant and the result is shown in Fig.6  </P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.6 Normal SDS-PAGE of NhaA and NhaB </P><P>
	Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); Lane 2-4, the homogenate of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB; Lane 5, 6 and 8, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB, Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control. 

	The bands were clearer this time, but there was no significant difference between the empty vector plasmid and the transformed ones.
After two times of unsuccessful attempts, BNU-China reviewed some articles of reliable protocols for membrane extraction and detection. With the protocols collected, they processed the experiment the third time(Fig.7). </P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig.7 SDS-PAGE of extracted membrane proteins</P><P>Lane 1, molecular weight standards (kDa); lane 2-4, the sediment of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 5-7, the supernatant of pSB1C3, NhaA and NhaB after centrifuging for the second time; Lane 8-10, the supernatant of pSB1C3, <I>NhaA</I> and <I>NhaB</I> after centrifuging for the first time. Bacteria transformed with plasmid pSB1C3 as a negative control.

From this result BNU-China concluded that the differences exist between the bands of controlled plasmid and the experimental ones, whereas it seemed that these differences had nothing to do with the objective product. Hence, it came out as another failure.</P><P>
Relevant agent formula:
protein lysis buffer
Tris-HCl (pH=8.0)      85 mL
Sucrose             25.67 g
β-mercaptoethanol   15 mL 
membrane solution buffer
protein lysis buffer : urea solution (8M) = 4 : 1 (volume ratio ))</P><P>
	Therefore, it was a pity that BNU_China failed to detect those two proteins, but they were able to give some opinions to us about protein detection through their experience:
1. Changing the expression strain for overexpressing of NhaA and NhaB according to the citation <SUP>[1]</SUP>, the details are in Table. 2.
2. Make western blots if possible.
The experiments gave us lots of information about membrane proteins. What’s more, the experience helps us two teams communicate frequently and therefore develop a tight relationship eventually.</P><P style="clear:right;text-align:center;">Table. 2 Bacteria strains specially for overexpressing NhaA</P><H2 style="float:left;margin-left:10px;clear:right;">BIT_China for TJU</H2><P style="clear:left;">
		TJU is our old friend in the iGEM stage; we had collaborated with them in experiment, modeling in past two years.

		P170 is a kind of acid-induced promoter, and can be bound by rcfB protein activated by lactic acid. To verify the relationship between concentration of lactic acid and promoter, P170 was linked with RFP gene, and strength of fluorescence was measured. Fig.8 shows the circuit with promoter P170.

Promoter P170 can be activated in two ways. The first pathway is to bind to the dimerization of lactic acid and RcfB. The other pathway basing on our assumption is that a proportion  of P170 can be activated directly. 
Thus, the concentration of activated P170 promoter is described as:

			Basic circuits contain two subsystems: resistance subsystem and regulation subsystem. Models of these two subsystems were constructed separately.
			Main processes include induction of the promoters, transcription and translation of function genes, catalysis of enzymes and acid or alkali production led by enzymes. ODE is used for modeling to describe concentration as function of time. Factors considered are production and degradation, combination and disaggregation and reversible reaction.
			Resistance subsystem consists of constitutive promoter J23119, function genes <I>glsA</I>, <I>NhaA</I> and <I>NhaB</I>. J23119 is not influenced by environmental pH, and will lead enzymes production continuously. </P><P style="text-align:center;">Fig. 1 Basic resistance device.</P><P>
