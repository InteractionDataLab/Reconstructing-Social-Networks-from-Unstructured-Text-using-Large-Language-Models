Proposed a functional prototype pH Controller to solve problems concerning acid and alkali by bacteria themselves. https://2015.igem.org/Team:BIT-China/Design
Integrated Human Practices of other iGEM teams, business and the public. From these activities, many biosafety and sustainability issues (e.g. If our production will have bad effects on fermentation or How can our project save economic costs) were identified, investigated and addressed in the context of our project.
