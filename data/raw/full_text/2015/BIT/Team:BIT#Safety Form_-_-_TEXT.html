1. BIT_Safety_2015_Spreadsheet
Species Name (including stain): E. coli (DH5alpha)
Risk Group: Risk Group 1
Risk Group Source: Common iGEM Organisms
Pathogenicity: None
Parts Number: BBa_I0500\BBa_K081016\BBa_K575032
Natural Function of Parts:
BBa_I0500 (Inducible pBad/araC promoter)
BBa_K081016 (lasI protein generator - PoPS->lasI)
BBa_K575032 (Rh1R/PAI2 Inducible Promoter + RBS (B0030) + GFP + Constitutive Promoter +RBS (B0030) + Rh1R)
Use of Parts:
BBa_I0500 (Sensor)
BBa_K081016 (Sensor)
BBa_K575032 (Amplifier)
Source of Acquiring:
Bacteria: TRANSGEN BIOTECH
Plasmid: iGEM Standard Kit Plate
2. Chassis Organism
E. coli (lab strains that are not harmful to humans)
3. Principle of Project
Our bacteria will detect the macromolecules from the sample outside human body. The bacteria play a role of expressing and amplifying the signal. The names of important parts we used are BBa_I0500, BBa_K081016 and BBa_K575032.
4. Preventive Measures for Potential Risks
1) Wearing rubber gloves.
2) Handling bacteria experiments with alcohol burner.
3) Sterilizing bacteria by using 84 disinfectants.
4) Using specific sewer to deal with bacteria waste.
5. Product in Real World
In a small enclosed device
The Ideal Real Product: The bacterium will be made into dry powder by the method of freeze-drying. And the powder will apply to the chamber of micro-fluidic chip. When users need to detect certain disease, users can add their blood sample into the chip and insert chip into the hardware we designed so that results will be simply shown.
