Biobricks
In our project, we expect that plasmid DNA interacting with a Carbon nanotube will be internalized into the cell and then expressed, this is a system we call “Carbon Carriers.” This construction allows us to confirm the success of the experiment: if the resulting cell turns out to be fluorescent, we can confirm in a simple and efficient way the expression of our gene and the success of our     experiment.
Our goal is to prove that carbon nanoparticles can be a novel and efficient method for celltransformation and transfection in models such as E.coli and Bos taurus Oocites.
BBa_K747096
Aim:
The CMV is a promoter, we selected this part for it being the only option as a mammalian promoter. Also, as noted in the iGEM wikis, this is the sole mammalian promoter and is actually part of a lacl-gene. Also, as described in the wiki, we chose this promoter because of its ability to induce fluorescence in bacteria, as accomplished by DTU Denmark.
For our project, since we were working with both mammal and bacterial models, we decided to   include this promoter.
BBa_E0040
This part codes for a green fluorescent protein. Like other standard parts, it comes with the iGEM prefix and Suffix for a cut-ligation sites with other standard parts the GFP site and a CamR site.
Aim:
An standard backbone used for biobricks, we decided on its use for its simplicity and high-expression We have selected this backbone part since it’s a high-copy plasmid, which suits our needs. in conjunction with the other selected parts (CMV-promoter and BBa_E0040 Green fluorescent protein) we expect to create a part which will ultimately work as an efficient

This is the map of the plasmid backbone with both suffix and prefix, lacl site and tetracycline resistance.
