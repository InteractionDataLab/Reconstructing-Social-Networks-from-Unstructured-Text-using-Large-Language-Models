iGEM Tec-Chihuahua is especially commited with the safety area of the project. We  paid attention to all the details in the projects to assure our well being and that of others who may have access to the lab, such as students, profesors, cleaning personnel and visitors; also, the practices to maintain security in our laboratory provides more certainty for better experimental results.</H1></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><UL id="safety-menu"><LI><A href="#training">Training</A></LI><LI><A href="#labsafety">Lab Safety</A></LI><LI><A href="#organisms">Organisms we use</A></LI><LI><A href="#forms">Forms</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION></HEADER><SECTION class="text-center"><DIV class="container"><H1 id="training" class="arrow">Training</H1><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H2>Each member of the team took three online courses about Laboratory Biosafety and Biosecurity offered by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC):</H2></DIV><DIV class="col-md-10 training-courses-left"><DIV class="col-md-10"><H1>General Safety for Containment Labs</H1><P>Incorrect technical and human errors can threaten even the best measures implemented to protect the team.

It is pathogenic in humans and animals, but not in plants. Currently DH5α is most often used for routine cloning applications strain.
</P><H3 class="organisms-safety">Bos taurus (oocytes)</H3><P class="organisms-organism">The most common and cheapest way to obtain oocytes is from slaughterhouse ovaries, so there is ample knowledge of the factors affecting the collection of ovaries. That said, the oocytes of slaughtered animals, represent a viable alternative for the production of embryos, wich can be used to basic research and/or practice of other reproductive technologies. 
It is important to acknowledge that the animals from which the cells of interest  are obtained, are treated with respect and are destined for human consumption.
The lab work only reached the in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes, not fertilization. The technique to follow can be permormed in a variety of growing conditions depending on the environment in which the in vivo oocytes are. To mention an example, the good management of the incubator, the workspace and the sterile conditions where these are handled must be verified.

The debate revolves around the safety that  these plants offer when they are used as food, as well as the long-term ecological consequences of their cultivation. In our case, the specimen that we will use, will not be used for this aim, but to evaluate a new technique of transformation, but still, a risk assessment is needed to verify that the inserted gene doesn´t have any harmful activity such as:
