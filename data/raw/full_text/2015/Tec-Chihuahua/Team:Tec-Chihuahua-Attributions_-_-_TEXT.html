Carolina Ramírez Márquez 
Team leader / CNT functionalization / Fund collection / Human Practice / Oocytes lab work
I am a twenty one year old student of Biotechnology Engineering at ITESM Chihuahua, Mexico. I am currently studying the ninth semester of my course. I am a highly motivated individual and a fast learner. I am part of this research team because I consider myself very important to contribute my knowledge to the new biotechnologist discoveries. I would really like to demonstrate that I can achieve goals with real impact not only in my school but in the world of research.

Bacterial transformation / Plant transfection / Oocytes lab work / Parts Design
I’m a second-going-on-third year biotechnology student.  Apart from this, I’m a member of the school’s volleyball representative team. My hobbies are to walk around downtown with some good songs on my earphones, and now, this project; the knowledge I have gained it this is unvaluable. Let’s just say I have next semester unlocked (; Also, volleyball.
Adrian Díaz Chávez
NP-CNT synthesis / Laboratory working direction / Oocytes lab work
I am studying biotechnology in Tec of Monterrey Campus Chihuahua. Actually I´m a third semester student and I am the youngest person of the team. I’m 19 years old and I’m from Cuauhtémoc, Chihuahua, so yes I’m a foreign. I only have one year in the college and therefore I have a lot to learn, but I am enthusiastic for the project. I love to watch movies and my favourite saga is Star Wars also I like to run and go out with my friends and girlfriend ;). I am in a youth group called MFC where I am a coordinator. I love my family and I consider is the most important part of my life.

NP-CNT synthesis / Wiki  / Oocytes lab work
I am a fifth-semester student of Biotechnology Engineering, I´m 19 years old, I am hard working and I like to learn new stuff about a lot of topics, my interests cover literature, dance, nature, and of course, science. I would like to thank to my family for all the support and affection, and to my teammates (friends) and instructors for the good moments and learning. I´m very happy of being part of the frist team of my University that participates on iGEM!
Ariel Sotelo
CNT functionalization / Laboratory working direction / Plants transfection
I'm biotechnology engineering student at the Technological Institute of Superior Studies of Monterrey Campus Chihuahua. I am currently in tenth semester. I like all sports generally being the most outstanding baseball, soccer and volleyball, practical mixed martial arts, cycling and fruit growing. Among my favorite areas is microscopy, spectrophotometry and genetic engineering, so in this team, I hope to have an excellent performance in the test area and functionalization of carbon nanotubes entities, during and after the union of biomolecules.
Manuel Lerma Porras
Laboratory working direction / Embrionic cells transfection
I´m 19 years old and currently studying the fifth semester on biotechnology engineering.  I like to do sports and science. I have not defined the area that I want to specialize on my career yet, but my options are in pharmacology, agriculture or livestock.
Romina Catellanos Rincón
NP- CNT purification / Wiki / Plant transfection
I am a ninth semester student of biotechnology engineering and a very encouraged person, I like to enrich my knowledge in the area of biotechnology and not only in an academic way, also personal, professional, social and cultural, so I can perform my profession and my personality in an integral way. Being in a critical point of my professional career I am excited to learn how I can develop new technologies, how to know more applications of my professional career in an employment level because I want to create a wide vision and criteria. I am highly motivated to exploit my potential and I have complete disposition to do it.
