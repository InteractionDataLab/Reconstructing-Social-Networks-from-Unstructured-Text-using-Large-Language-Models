Each submitted part has been properly documented on the registry - click on the part number in the table above. Specifically, in regards to judging requirements (click links to see full documentation):
BBa_K1610202 (link) is submitted as the new standard biobrick part. This part comprises of ACT and a terminator, and was made in order for us to create the main device. (Silver requirement)
We documented the charecterization of an existing part, BBa_K608351 (link) . Particularly, we documented the activation temperatures and times of the TempSens promoter. (Silver requirement)
We experimentally validated our new device, BBa_K1610105 (link) . (gold requirement)
