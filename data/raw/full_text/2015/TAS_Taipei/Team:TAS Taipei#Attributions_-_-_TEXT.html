Parts
Granzyme B - a blessing and a curse. It's crucial for controlling cancer, but it causes damage when out of cellular space. Let's find the best of both worlds with selective GzmB Inhibition.
EXPERIMENTAL
Granzyme Inhibitor Construct
Prototype Work
Safety Switch
Notebook
We conduct science - and we are proud to show it. Follow along with our journey of discovery in the lab.
