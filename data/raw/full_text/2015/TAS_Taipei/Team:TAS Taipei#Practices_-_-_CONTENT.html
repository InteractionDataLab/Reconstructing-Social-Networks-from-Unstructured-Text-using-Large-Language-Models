In an age where there is so much distrust and misinformation about scientific research, we must double our efforts to educate, collaborate and listen to what the general public has to say about the state of scientific research.</P><P class="col-sm-12">
							Throughout the policy and practices portion of the iGEM project, we have gained a tremendous about of insight into the public's knowledge and concerns about synthetic biology.  We have sought to educate as many people as possible about our project, synthetic biology in general and the amazing potential of re-engineered genetic engineering.
						</P><P class="col-sm-8">
							Our policy and practices project is divided into four sections: &quot;Research&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;Outreach&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment&quot;. In the &quot;Research&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; sections we gathered information and data from the public and from experts in science, medicine and policy analysis so that we could inform ourselves about ALL aspects of our project not just experiments in the lab.  Since our project is a health and medicine project, we then took this research and created a policy brief outlining changes that we would like to see in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry.  This innovative policy brief was then sent to government agencies and some of the most influential people in the world in hopes that they would help us make a lasting change in the world.
							The &quot;Outreach&quot; and &quot;Entertainment&quot; sections show all of the programs, activities and meet-ups that we have had with various student and public groups.

							Our project goal is to prevent tissue damage from chronic inflammation by inhibiting Granzyme B in the extracellular matrix.  In order to accomplish this task, we needed A LOT of help and advice. Some of our team members learned a little bit about inflammation in AP or IB biology, but if we wanted to create a project dealing with the harmful effects of inflammation, we needed to ask for more help.  We received valuable help from research scientists currently working with Granzyme B, medical doctors who had expertise working with patients with chronic inflammation, and policy analysts who make rules and decisions regarding the safety and viability of synthetic biology projects.  Ultimately the information we gathered helped us shape and guide our project.  By taking into account the advice from these experts, we have created a possibly feasible project and a functional prototype. 
						</P><P class="col-sm-12">
							In addition to the advice we received on the background and experimental portion of our project, the policy advice we received from The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (Committee on Science, Technology and Law – Forum on Synthetic Biology) helped us create a policy brief that we sent to the US Senate, US House, World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and Mark Zuckerberg's Silicon Valley Community Foundation.  Our innovative policy informed policy makers about the uneven spending discrepancy between R&amp;D and marketing in pharmaceutical companies.  Based on our policy research, we offered a potential solution to this problem for policy makers to consider.

								We reached out to Dr. Bird to discuss the effects that inhibiting GzmB in the ECM would have on the human body.  He informed us inhibiting GzmB completely would have extremely negative effects.  This had a big effect on our project.  We needed to figure out a way to only partially inhibit GzmB so that it would maintain normal levels of GzmB.  We modeled GzmB concentration vs ACT inhibitor levels and developed a calculator to estimate how much of our inhibitor protein to bring elevated GzmB levels down to normal.(<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:TAS_Taipei/Modeling#calculator">link</A>)

									We interviewed Dr. Hsieh about the different type of inflammation that exist and about her experiences with patients who have had chronic inflammation.  Through her we learned that chronic inflammation was a major problem especially for elderly patients.  We asked her about the application of our bandage prototype and our cream prototype.  She said that she thought both prototype ideas were plausible but would require lots of clinical trials.

								After receiving experimental and application advice from experts, we wanted to investigate the policy roadblocks we would encounter trying to get our project to the actual market.  We emailed every member of the The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (Committee on Science, Technology and Law – Forum on Synthetic Biology) with a list of 5 questions specifically related to policy issues:
								<OL><LI><B>What more should the government be doing</B> to encourage the development of synthetic biology and biopharmaceuticals?</LI><LI><B>What are the main obstacles</B> to getting biopharmaceutical treatments to market, and what, if any policy changes should be made to the regulatory environment to get these treatments to market?</LI><LI><B>What, if anything, should the government do to increase the accessibility</B> of biopharmaceutical treatments to the public?</LI><LI>To what extent is a <B>supply gap</B> impending for biopharmaceutical treatments?

									Nexavar is an anti-cancer drug developed by Bayer International.  As of early 2014, the price of the drug was $65,000.00 USD <U>PER YEAR</U>, per patient (Reference).  On December 3rd, 2013, Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers was quoted at an event saying the following as a response to disputes between Bayer and Indian Government over drug patents and the implementation of the India compulsory license.
								</P><H4 style="background-color:red; padding:20px; color:white" class="col-sm-12">
									&quot;We did not develop this medicine for Indians. We developed it for western patients who can afford it.&quot;-	Bayer CEO Marijin Dekkers
								</H4><P class="col-sm-8">
									We find this attitude from Marijin Dekkers to be absolutely appalling.  But we are not naïve enough to think that there aren't more pharmaceutical companies that feel the exact same way.  We believe that pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals should be affordable and accessible to anyone who needs treatment.  We want to develop an inexpensive, yet viable (from a business perspective) method for the distribution of our treatment.  We started to research how pharmaceutical companies spend their money.  We discovered that the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies spend more in marketing and advertising than they do in research and development. 
								</P><P class="col-sm-12">
									Excess spending on marketing and advertising reduces the amount of money that is spent on R&amp;D.  This also decreases the availability of new drugs to people who need them.  Therefore, our goal is to facilitate biopharmaceutical companies to redistribute money to R&amp;D for life altering diseases instead of overspending on marketing and advertising.  Currently the United States has tax incentives for research and development (R&amp;D) for pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. because R&amp;D increases the quality of health care. R&amp;D incentives can encourage the discovery of new drugs and can lower the cost of current pharmaceuticals. These incentives have been successful in supporting pharmaceutical companies' growth. These tax incentives, however, have recently been overused by companies in the “supporting functions” of R&amp;D expenses, namely, marketing and advertising.  Hence, the government’s tax credits for developing more effective and efficient drugs is being used beyond its original purpose. To prevent biopharmaceuticals from following this same trend, we propose that there should be clear distinction between incentives for R&amp;D marketing and incentives for actual research.  American taxpayer funds should go to promote research that benefits the common good, not additional advertising.

Furthermore, we raised awareness during the TAS annual club fair and allow students to join the club. Students in the iGEM club will not only have a chance to input ideas during our planning stage, but also have an opportunity to have a hands on experience of lab work.
