We did our work at P1 level bio lab and worked with E. coli DH5alpha and BL21 strains.
We have safety training by a lab manager in the school and followed standard lab regulation. We (dried them completely in the oven at 100°C) before flame test and application. We recommend that the fire retardant proteins should be purified before use.
Safety training was done at iGEM bio lab at Mingdao High School, which follows the regulation of BioSafety of Mingdao High School  and Safety Guide for the Lab of Genetic Engineering  from Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan.

Protocol        3
Autoclave
The genetically engineered bacteria with recombinant DNAs were sterilized before discarded.
Laminar Flow
The bacteria were manipulated in the laminar flow cabinet.
Latex Glove & Laboratory Coat
We always wear gloves and coats in the lab.
Fire Extinguisher
Several extinguishers are prepared in experiments with fire.
Emergency Shower & Eyewash
Emergency shower and eyewash are equipped if there’s any necessaries.
We created fire retardant bacteria, any concerns about the application?
We would like to apply our prototype of fire retardant protein/bacteria to paint and textile industries. We didn’t perform any test with purified proteins so far because of time and cost. We recommend the proteins have better to be purified before any application. If you want to use them as paint, you can just dry and kill them completely like what we did in our test. Furthermore, we’re planning to collaborate with the KraigLabs to make GE silkworm to produce fire retardant fibers by putting the SR genes into the host.
 
 
Will there be any biological material escape from our lab?
1) We always killed all the materials including bacteria by standard autoclave procedure before letting them leave the lab.
 
2) The model of wooden house coated with fire retardant bacteria was dried completely in the oven at 100 for over 30 min. All the bacteria are supposed to be killed by the procedure. The fire retardant effectiveness is based on the composition of the contents, and it still works well after killing the bacteria or decomposing the proteins.
 
 
Is it dangerous to burn the materials such as cotton, cloth and wooden house in school?
In flame test, we burned our samples in a chemical lab, which has equipment with chemical fume hoods. In addition, there’s fire extinguisher, fire resisting sand, etc. in a regular lab setting.
