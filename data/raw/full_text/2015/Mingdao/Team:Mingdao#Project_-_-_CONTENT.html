Fire retardant chemicals can stop the fire and resist for up to 30 minutes. However, the chemicals contain halogen elements and organophosphate that have adverse effect on wildlife. Natural products have been reported as fire retardant biomaterials such as milk and wool because of high amount of phosphorus and nitrogen contents, respectively. We mined data from protein database and found a protein candidate, SR protein (serine/arginine splicing factor) with fire retardant properties. Cotton and cloth soaked with SR protein-producing bacteria have been proved as fire retardant materials on flame test. Furthermore, the wooden house painted with our bio-coatings are resistant to fire up to 45 seconds. We demonstrated the prototype to DLuB Fire Retardant Paint Inc. and plan to transfer the technology to KraigLabs, a Spider Silk Technology Company using genetically modified silkworm to produce fire retardant fabrics.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><NAV class="MenuBar clearfix pinned-colelem" id="menuu5202"><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5210"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5213" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#abstract"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5216-4"><P id="u5216-2">Abstract        1</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5259"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5260" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#motivation"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5262-4"><P id="u5262-2">Motivation       2</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5252"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5253" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#background"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5255-4"><P id="u5255-2">Background       3</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5380"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5381" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#approach"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5382-4"><P id="u5382-2">Approach       4</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5245"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5246" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#result"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5248-4"><P id="u5248-2">Results       5</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5373"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu anim_swing rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5374" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Project#summary-discussion"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5375-4"><P id="u5375-2">Summary &amp; Discussion    6</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5366"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5367" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Design#prototype"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5370-4"><P id="u5370-2">Prototype       7</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5275"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5276" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Application#application"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5278-4"><P id="u5278-2">Application       8</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="MenuItemContainer clearfix colelem" id="u5268"><A class="nonblock nontext MenuItem MenuItemWithSubMenu rgba-background clearfix grpelem" id="u5269" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Mingdao/Collaborations"><DIV class="MenuItemLabel clearfix grpelem" id="u5271-4"><P id="u5271-2">Collaboration      9</P></DIV></A></DIV></NAV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="pu4142"><DIV class="clearfix grpelem" id="u3591-11"><P id="u3591-8">In June 2015, flammable <A class="nonblock" href="http://www.inquisitr.com/2213697/taiwan-water-park-explosion-leads-to-horrific-burns-and-death-what-went-wrong/">dust explosion</A> occurred at Formosa Fun Coast in Taiwan.

Flame combustion requires three essential elements, heat, oxygen and fuel (fire triangle) and fire needs free radicals to spread. Removing one of them can stop the fire. Phosphorus and nitrogen can both react with free radicals and eliminate them. Fuels burned with materials containing phosphates can rapidly release water and form carbon layer. This charring process can isolate the fuel and protect it from burning. Ammonia burned in the air may react with oxygen to produce water and nitrogen gas, which could be a kind of inert gas to replace or isolate oxygen during combustion process.</P></DIV><DIV class="clearfix grpelem" id="pu3636"><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u4164-4" style="font-size:12px;"><P>Credit: campaignforwool.org</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3648-4"><P>Our goal of iGEM project this year is to find a novel fire retardant bio-material in addition to casein and wool.

Furthermore, SR protein modified by SRPK kinase can be clearly observed in the shifted bands, probably demonstrating the phosphorylation process.</P></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3792"><DIV class="clearfix grpelem" id="u3794"><DIV class="clearfix grpelem" id="u3796-4"><P>*</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="clearfix grpelem" id="u3793-4"><P>*</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3812-6"><P>Figure 1.</P><P>Burning lengths of cloth samples soaked with E. coli BL21 expressing proteins.</P></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3798-6"><P>Figure 2.</P><P>Burning lengths of cotton samples soaked with E. coli BL21 expressing proteins.</P></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3819-4"><P>Taken together, the data of flame test strongly proved that phosphorylated SR protein is able to retard the fire propagation and further extinguish the burning. Moreover, the unphosphorylated SR protein has also some effect on fire retardancy. The results are not only demonstrating phosphorylated SR protein is a novel fire retardant protein, but also verifying our theoretical hypothesis of phosphoserine and nitrogen contents that play unique and additive roles on the fire retardant properties.</P></DIV><DIV class="clearfix colelem" id="u3822-16"><P>Casein and wool are natural products with fire retardant properties. Phosphorus and nitrogen play important roles on the fire retardancy. We searched the highest (phospho)serine and highest arginine (nitrogen) contents in the protein databank of Uniprot by data mining. SR proteins are a family of proteins conversed in serine/arginine-rich domain and highly be phosphorylated. We expressed SR protein and SRPK1 kinase protein in E. coli BL21, which were analyzed in SDS-PAGE with coomassie blue staining and Western blotting with specific antibodies. Next, flame tests were performed on cloth and cotton samples soaked in the culture media containing protein-producing bacteria, demonstrating the fire retardant efficacy of phosphorylated SR proteins.</P><P> </P><P>In protein analysis of phosphorylated SR proteins (section “Protein Expression”, Figure 3), total lysates were blotted with anti-GST antibody. The data showed various levels of band shift on SR plus SRPK (Lane 4) compared to SR only (Lane 2) around 53 kDa, indicating modification of SR protein. This result highly suggests SR protein underwent phosphorylation due to the presence of SRPK kinase. On the other hand, we’re trying to blot the lysates of phosphorylated SR protein with anti-phosphoserine antibody. However, we technically failed the experiment and didn’t get a good result with anti-phosphoserine antibody.</P><P> </P><P>Phosphorus and nitrogen are important on the effect of fire retardancy. We tried to synthesize a gene encoding a polypeptide with arginine repeat. However, IDT company, a sponsor of iGEM, replied us a technical difficulty on synthesizing nucleotides with high frequency repeats. As for phosphorus, as we mentioned, proteins don’t carry any phosphate groups until being phosphorylated by specific kinase. Therefore, finding an existing protein and using an identified kinase are ideal to make phosphorylated proteins.</P><P> </P><P>Currently, we don’t compare SR proteins to casein or wool on fire retardant efficiency. Because the cost and time to purify SR proteins are still problems for us so far. We are looking for companies who might have interests in fire retardant bio-materials sponsoring us to solidify our discovery.</P><P> </P><P>In summary, our work is a proof-of-concept study of finding and verifying a novel fire retardant natural protein candidate of SR protein through data mining and flame test. Casein and wool have been proved as natural, non-toxic fire retardant bio-materials. And both of them have been patented. The SR protein we found could be the next-generation biomaterial for studying fire retardant effectiveness.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
