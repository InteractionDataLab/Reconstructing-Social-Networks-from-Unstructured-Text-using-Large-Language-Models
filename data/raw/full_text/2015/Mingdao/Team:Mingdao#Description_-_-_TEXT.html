Fire Retardant Biomaterials
Fire can kill life when it gets out of control. Fire is an oxidation-reduction reaction of chemical process. Flame combustion starts from three main elements, so-called fire triangle, that is, heat, oxygen and fuel.  Fire can expand further by the chain reaction induced by active free radicals made from the combustion. Fire retardant materials have wide applications to slow or even stop the fire. However, the major of these materials are synthesized from chemicals, and many of them have been proven as toxic. As a result, natural biomaterials with fire retardant properties are increasingly important. Casein and wool have been reported as effective fire retardant biomaterials. In our iGEM project this year, we are going to analyze the components in casein and wool as well as figure out why they can retard the fire. Based on this knowledge, we can design and genetically engineer the bacteria to be novel fire retardant biomaterials without toxicity.
Tell us about your project, describe what moves you and why this is something important for your team.
What should this page contain?
A clear and concise description of your project.
A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.
References and sources to document your research.
Use illustrations and other visual resources to explain your project.
Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
