Application
We successfully found a novel fire retardant protein and created fire retardant bacteria proved by flame test on the samples of cotton and wooden house. Next, we’d like to apply our prototype product to the related industry. Firstly, we contact a local company developing fire retardant paint in Taichung. On the other hand, we ask Kraig Biocraft Laboratories for collaboration on genetically modified silkworm to produce fire retardant silk.

Fire retardants market  is predicted to reach nearly $6 billion by 2018. We visited a local company, DLuB in Taichung, Taiwan. DLuB is a paint-based company developing fireproof and natural, non-toxic products. We demonstrated and promoted our prototypes  of fire retardant bacteria to them. They’re interested in our products and encouraged a collaboration for further research. For more detail, you can take a look on DLuB ’s Facebook page.

Silk is a natural protein fiber which can be woven into textile, made from the cocoons which are formed by silkworms. Silk filament is tough, fine and elastic, and can be made into cloth.
Spider silk is another protein fiber spun by spiders. It has been recognized stronger than steel in terms of density, tensile strength and toughness, etc. The properties attract increasingly attention in the various industry as the potential to make indestructible fiber and rope, replace human ligaments and bones, improve body armor, and even be used as tether for aircraft carrier.
 
Due to the scarcity of natural spider silk, the researchers developed the “spider-goats” with the spider genes into the goat. The genetically modified goat can produce the milk with spider silk protein, and the protein can be further extracted for use. However, the cost and the difficulties on the technology still need to be overcame.

GE silkworm is recently developed and applied to the industry. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories , Inc. is a leading company focusing on the technology of genetically engineering silkworms to produce next-generation polymers. Spider silk produced by GE silkworm is well developed and mature to be applied in the market. The market value is estimated to be multibillion dollars in textile industry.
 
Fire resistant fabric market  is believed to be worth up to 5 billions in near future. Based on our achievement, you may wonder if the technology of GE silkworm come with fire retardant proteins.
 
We’ve contacted Kraig Labs and sought collaboration to develop fire retardant silk by the technology of genetically engineering silkworms. Jon Rice , the Chief Operations Officer, replied as interested in the collaboration and the development. The story still continues!
