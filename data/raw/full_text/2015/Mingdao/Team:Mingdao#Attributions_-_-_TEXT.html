  Mingdao iGEM team has 3 instructors and 24 members as well as 3 alumni and one advisor from Academia Sinica in Taiwan. In dry lab, we collaborate with NCTU-Formosa to do protein data mining in searching for novel possible fire retardant proteins.
 
 
  To complete the iGEM project and prepare for the Jamboree, we set up leaders to organize the team with the groups of project research & design, dry lab, wet lab, multimedia & art, webpage design and human practices as well as speakers and magician for presentation in the jamboree.
