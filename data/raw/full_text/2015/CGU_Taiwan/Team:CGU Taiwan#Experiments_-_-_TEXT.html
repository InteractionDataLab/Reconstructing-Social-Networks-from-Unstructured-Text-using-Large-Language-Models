4. During incubation of PCR reaction, prepare a 1.2% agarose gel.
   (1) Measure 1.92 g agarose powder to a 500 ml-bottle, and add 160 ml 1x TAE buffer.
   (2) Melt agarose solution in microwave until the powder is dissolved. Be careful not to over-heat it, otherwise, you would evaporate water and make incorrect concentration of agarose gel.
   (3) Put the bottle on the hot plate, stir with stirring-bar until the bottle is cooled down to 60-70 oC.
   (4) Add 7.5 μl DNA view .
   (5) Pour agarose to the gel holder with the gel comb (25-well tooth) in place. After the agarose gel is solidified, transfer it to the gel running chamber. Fill the box with 1xTAE buffer enough to cover the whole gel.
5. Load the following samples in order into the wells of 1.2% agarose gel:
   (1) 1kb-DNA ladder, 6 μl
   (2) PCR control, 5 μl
   (3) DNA PCR product, 5 μl
Preparation LB broth and LB plates
LB broth component
Tryptone
10 g
Yeast extracts
5 g
NaCl
5 g
＊Agar (LB plate)
15 g
H2O
1 L
LB broth preparation:
1. Measure 5 g LB powder, and then pour it to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 200 ml water pre-loaded
2. Add water up to 250ml when the LB powder melts completely.
LB plates preparation:
1. Measure 5 g LB powder, and then pour it to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 200 ml water pre-loaded.
2. Add water up to 250 ml when the LB powder melts completely.
3. Pour 3.75 g agar powder and throw into a stir bar.
4. Autoclave at 121℃for 30 min (if the container is a bottle with a screw cap, be sure to remember to unscrew the little screw cap)
5. After sterilization, put it in 60℃water bath until the solution temperature dropped to 60℃.
6. Add 250 μl ampicillin (100mg / ml) (the final concentration 100μg / ml) and stir mixing (stir gently, you should avoid bubbles)
7. Pour about 20-25 ml medium to each of the 90-mm plate (should avoid bubbles).
8. After agar plate solidification, packed into bags and mark the date and name.
Restriction enzyme mapping
1. Note the concentrations of DNA labeled on the tube.
2. Set up restriction digests (final volume is 10 μl for each reaction)
Plasmid (0.2 mg/ml)
5 μl
10X buffer
1
Restriction Enzyme
(10 units/μl) 1 μl
ddH2O
3 μl
Final volume
10 μl
Incubate at 37℃ in a dry heat-block for 1 hr.
3. During the incubation of the digestion reactions, prepare a 1.2% agarose gel:
   (1) Measure 1.92 g agarose powder to a 500ml-bottle, and add 160 ml 1X TAE buffer.
   (2) Melt agarose solution in microwave until the powder is dissolved. Be careful not to over-heat it, or else too much water may evaporate and result in gels of the incorrect agarose concentration.    (3) Let gel solution cool down to 60-70°C (very warm but not hot).
   (4) Add 12 μl of DNA View.
   (5) Pour agarose to the gel holder with the gel comb (25-well tooth) in place. After the agarose gel is solidified, transfer it to the gel running chamber. Fill the box with 1X TAE buffer enough to cover the whole gel.                                    4. Briefly centrifuge the reactions, add 2 μl of 6X loading dye and mix by pipetting.
5. Load the following samples in the indicated order into the wells of the agarose gel:    (1) 1kb-DNA ladder, 5μl
   (2) Uncut wild-type DNA control, 4μl
   (3) Digested sample 8μl
*Uncut DNA control: In microcentrifuge tubes add 5μl Uncut DNA, 5 μl of ddH2O, and 2 μl of 6X DNA loading dye. Mix well by gentle pipetting.
6. Turn on the power supply and run at 100V for 30 min.
7. Carefully lift the gel and visualize all DNA fragments under camera-equipped gel documentation system. Take a picture of the gel.
8. Figure out the restriction enzyme maps of our test plamsids based on our digests and compares them to the predicted version we drew.
9. Judge if the plasmids are correct
Transformation (all steps before heat-shock needs to be on ice!!)
1. Thaw a tube of DH10βcompetent bacteria on ice. Pre-cool two clean microcentrifuge tubes and ligation reactions.
2. Transfer 50μl each of bacteria cells into two tubes. Do not pipet bacteria!
3. Add 2μl ligation product to bacteria. Incubate DNA/bacteria mix on ice for 30 min.
4. Heat shock competent bacteria at 42°C for 1min.
5. Incubate DNA/bacteria mix on ice for 3min.
6. Add 300μl LB broth to each tube. Incubate bacteria at 370C for 30 min-1h.
7. Plate all bacteria/LB mix onto LB-Amp plates: transfer all LB/bacteria mix onto plates, add 5-10 glass plating beads to each plate, close lid of plates and shake gently so that the bacteria/LB mix is evenly distributed on the plates. Shake until there is no visible liquid left. Pour glass beads into beaker with ethanol (do not throw away or put back together with clean, unused beads!!)
8. Incubate plates at 370C overnight.
9. Come in tomorrow morning to count colonies!!
