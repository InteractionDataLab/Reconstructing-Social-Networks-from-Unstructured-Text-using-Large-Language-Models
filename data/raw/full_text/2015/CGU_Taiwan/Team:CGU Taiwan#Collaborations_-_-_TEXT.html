International Questionnaire
  This year is not only CGU_Taiwan very first time participating iGEM, also the very first collaboration around the globe. The survey was translated into six version of questionnaire,Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, French, Portuguese, German, English, the iGEM teams has help us to collect the data from their place to live.We are Organizer of this survey.
  From the question, food product is the most us unacceptable for people to be choose. The reason may cause by the unknown of risk that genetically modified food bright out. The unclear messages make people afraid of this kind of product. Thus, we need to tell them the widen usage nowadays. There is nothing to be scare because it already became part of our life. Of course, after understanding it, it’s their choices to have GMO as food or not. But before that, it’s our duty to make sure people know how synthetic biology has gradually changed our lives.
Also, from the survey we found out that the problem of not knowing oral cancer well enough is worldwide.
The best therapy of cancer isn’t medical treatments but prevention. How can people prevent it from happening, since they don’t know much about oral cancer? Therefore, our project included health education to raise the awareness and desire to change the circumstance.
There are people enjoy chewing betel nuts, but do they fully understand the risks of doing so? We doubt it. So the future of oral cancer health education we would like to go directly them and show them the potential problem so that they can decide whether to quite it or not.
This large scale survey told us how people think about synthetic biology and oral cancer. We can see our project in worldwide angle and start to change the world little by little.
