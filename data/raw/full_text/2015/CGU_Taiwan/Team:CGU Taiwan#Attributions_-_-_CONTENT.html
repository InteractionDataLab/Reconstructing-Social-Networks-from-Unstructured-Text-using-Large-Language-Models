												Chang Gung University is participating for the first time in the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition. As the founding members of CGU_Taiwan iGEM team, we have been helped and supported by many people, including professors from various disciplines, graduate students, other experienced iGEM teams and many more. We would like to thank every person who involved to the project. Without those helpful contributions, we probably wouldn’t have anything about iGEM.
