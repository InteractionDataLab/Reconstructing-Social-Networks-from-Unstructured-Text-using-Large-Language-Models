Chang Gung University is participating for the first time in the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition. As the founding members of CGU_Taiwan iGEM team, we have been helped and supported by many people, including professors from various disciplines, graduate students, other experienced iGEM teams and many more. We would like to thank every person who involved to the project. Without those helpful contributions, we probably wouldn’t have anything about iGEM.
Department of Biomedical Sciences
Dr. Ming-Chih Lai, Assistant Professor
Recommend useful suggestions on RNA experiments and provide us luciferase assay reagent.
Dr. Scott C. Schuyler, Assistant Professor
As one of our instructors, provided his lab space for us to do experiments, guide us greatly on yeast experiments and provide lab materials on yeast experiment.
