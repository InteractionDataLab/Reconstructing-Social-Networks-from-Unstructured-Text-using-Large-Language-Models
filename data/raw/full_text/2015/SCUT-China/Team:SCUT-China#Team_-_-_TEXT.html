The experiment group
Zhao Yaran
Aha, this is Zhao Yaran,the team leader of 2015 SCUT-China. As to me, synthetic biology is magical, so I took part in iGEM when my researching journey was begaining and this is my second time to join it. I'm very pleasure to complete our project with a group of great men. We worked hard to the same goal, with joy and tear.That's a nice trip I would never forget. Last, hope veryone leads a way to dream.We are family. I am the guy who is mainly responsible for detecting the concentration of cGMP.
Mo Zongchao
I am a sophomore undergraduate interested in living in a world full of books and movies in the countryside with my grandparents, and with the pomegranate I planted when I was 12 years old. And I have great passion for biology, law and economics that accompany me on a trip to the exploration of the fantastic world. In addition, I am quite known to my friends that I am an amateurish director in making short films recording the happy hours with my family and friends. The part of the project I am excited about is the cell culture and cell growth that I endeavor to.
Wu Fengyi
Wu Fengyi is a junior student from biotechnology. What made her be a iGEMer?What she likes is to do experiments. Her classmates have been joined this competition before and she got many interesting things from them.During summer vocation, she had chance to learn something about scientific research, at the same time, she found that biology is fantastic and attractive. She is a member of the experimental group. She was responsible for quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. She is gentle and quiet. In addition to learning, she has a few hobbies. Running, reading, planting or just listening to the music. The nature is her big friend, she like to see the blue sky or star-filled sky quietly. She can enjoy communicating with the flowers, the birds. Her idol is Li Jian, who has a good reputation in music.He moves his fans with his handsome look, profound knowledge, special life pursuit.

Cui Yuanbin
I have nothing to offer but blood,toil,tears and sweat. I’m fascinated with the elegance of biology and enjoy the process of achieving our desired goal. I spent a nice summer with my teammate working on our project.
Guan Ying
Synthesis biology is always a fanscinating topic that it can creat new things in biological way just like playing with blocks. So I decided to join iGEM when I first heard about it. I want to learn more interesting facts about biology and make friends in iGEM.
Li Bihong
A second-year Biological Science and Engineering student majoring in Biotechnology.
I am the member of our lab team and I have been in charge of designing our project and completing wet lab with other nine team members. I have spent my holidays in the lab working on RNA extraction, real-time PCR and analyzing the data. I am also one of the team leaders of our team so I have been responsible for team management.
In iGEM, I known what was Synthetic Biology, how to develop a project and had the chance to learn experiment skills. I really enjoy the time doing experiments without any distractions. It’s great to work with an accomplished team where you never stop refreshing yourself.                      Music, badminton, movies and books are my favorite things.
Chen Zhenfeng
My name is Czf. I am a sophomore majoring in bio-pharmaceuticals. Remember to smile and do not lose your faith in life. This saying motivates me when our project didn’t go well as we expected before. I am the guy who is mainly responsible for detecting the concentration of cGMP.
Li Xiangjun
Hi! I am a junior student majoring in Biology at South China University of Technology. As a memeber of SCUT—China,my task are detecting the value of cGMP, helping another team complete their project, communicating with other teams. I am so glad to attend 2015 iGEM which brings me lots of knowledge about synthetic biology, funny and magical. What’s more, iGEM also let me realizing my potential and teach me how to cooperate with other people vividly. Lastly, I just want to emphasize that iGEM and synthetic biology is so fascinating!
Li Changhao
This summer, I am pleased to have an opportunity to join the 2015 SCUT-CHINA and be able to have a better understanding of synthetic biology.
