We invited members of SKLBC-GDSYZX to our laboratory for a three-day experimental training to help them gain a better understanding of synthetic biology. We completed a part for their project. In addition, we tested the software they designed and provide them with feedbacks to improve it. At the meantime, we received suggestions about our project from Dr. Zhang Simin, one of the instructors of SKLBC-GDSYZX.</P><P> The Collaborations track of team SKLBC-GDSYZX can be found as follows:</P><P class="link"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX/Collaborations" style="color:#05b0ea">https://2015.igem.org/Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX/Collaborations</A></P></DIV><DIV class="collaborationContent" style="margin-top:30px; padding-top:0px;"><DIV class="collaborationContentHeading"><H3 style="color:#1b9fdb">Meetup    2015 July 14th</H3></DIV><P>During the day, members of three software teams, i.e. SKLBC-China, SYSU-Software and SKLBC-GDSYZX, and three laboratory teams, i.e. SCUT, SCUT-China and our team, gathered in the conference room of our institute. We discussed and exchanged thoughts about the relationships and interactions between the “wet” and “dry” work of synthetic biology. At this meet-up, we also shared our previous experience attending iGEM with two new teams, SKLBC-China and SKLBC-GDSYZX.</P></DIV><DIV class="collaborationContent"><DIV class="collaborationContentHeading"><H3 style="color:#4181c1">Experiment train   2015 August 7th- 9th </H3></DIV><P>Team SKLBC-GDSYZX’s project was to develop an online panel app, with which iGEMers can easily paint their gene circuits. As we know, a good product must meet the needs of customers. However, as a new high school team, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX were not familiar with the iGEMers’ demand when designing the app. In order to help them to get a better understanding of synthetic biology, we organized a series of basic genetic circuit constructing experiments during August 7th- 9th.</P></DIV><DIV class="collaborationContent"><DIV class="collaborationContentHeading"><H3 style="color:#6c5fa3">Gene circuits library </H3></DIV><P>To help iGEMers create amazing gene circuits easily, we suggested SKLBC-GDSYZX to collect remarkable past iGEM designs to build up a gene circuit library. During the process, members of SKLBC-GDSYZX could test their app and gain novel ideas about the app. However, gathering past iGEM gene circuits was a hard work for them since they were lack of experiences in synthetic biology. Therefore, we help them to study the past iGEM projects and used the panel app to construct a gene circuits library. Then we gave them feedbacks to help them improve panel app. These are some examples of gene circuits that we created with SKLBC-GDSYZX’s app below.</P><P class="link"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX/Project" style="color:#983d85">https://2015.igem.org/Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX/Project</A></P></DIV><DIV class="collaborationContent" style="padding-bottom:70px;"><DIV class="collaborationContentHeading"><H3 style="color:#af2b75"> course design</H3></DIV><P>The human practice of Team SKLBC-GDSYZX was to develop a class of synthetic biology .There were some troubles for the team members to understand the concepts in synthetic biology since their limited knowledge background. Therefore we offer to collect and simplify key knowledge points for them to facilitate their study. At last, we complete the work based on the textbook of Introduction to Synthetic Biology by Song Kai.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
