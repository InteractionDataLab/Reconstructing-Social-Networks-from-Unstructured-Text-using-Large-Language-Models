We interviewed medical staff and patients to learn about the current clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases. It helped us to improve the design our project to meet translational needs. Also, we conducted detailed data analysis for past iGEM projects, and found that cardiovascular area was under-studied compared to other areas in the Health &amp; Medicine track, i.e. antibiotics. We hope this area could be promoted by our work. Moreover, we spent time in communicating with a wide audience of iGEMers, cardiovascular experts, legal specialists and local residents to promote the healthy lifestyle of cardiovascular prevention, security of gene technology and knowledge of synthetic biology. All our HP work emphasized the social responsibilities of scientific staff, letting scientific project exert real impact on the society.</P><A id="pdf_link" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/a/a5/2015-SCUT-China-How_to_prevent_Cardiovascular_Diseases.pdf"><H4>Please click this PDF, and you will get a special gift (^_^) !</H4></A></DIV><DIV class="part"><DIV class="pic_four"><DIV class="pic_a"><A class="page-link" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT-China/hospitalInterview">Hospital Interview</A></DIV><DIV class="pic_b"><A class="page-link" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT-China/Conference">Seminar &amp; Conference</A></DIV><DIV class="pic_c"><A class="page-link" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT-China/dataAnalyse">Data Analysis</A></DIV><DIV class="pic_d"><A class="page-link" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT-China/criticalThinking">Law &amp; Regulation</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="part"><H3 style="color:#d53f60">Beyond the Bench and Back to the Bench</H3><P>We have spared no efforts to connect our human practice with laboratory work. We tried to make our human practice run through the experiments. Firstly, we searched and read plenty of papers, reports and past iGEM projects and analyzed the data we gathered. Secondly, we interviewed the doctors about present cardiovascular treatment and asked for advice of project design. After that, we had the first team seminar to talk about talent training and attended an important conference to present our initial idea and got lots of helpful and instructive feedbacks. After improvement, we implemented experiments and gained preliminary results. And then we had a dialogue with doctors to show the results and had the second team seminar to discuss how we can connect the modeling with our experiment. With abundant suggestions, we polished our project design again and gained more positive results which made us excited. Next, we made great contributions to promote the idea of gene therapy based on synthetic biology to those who are concerned about our project. We tried our best to have a dialogue with patients and discover their real living condition, and we introduce our new method of synthetic biology to acquire their precious thoughts and suggestions. Finally, we went back to the bench to do the final project design. That is the connection between our human practice and laboratory.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
