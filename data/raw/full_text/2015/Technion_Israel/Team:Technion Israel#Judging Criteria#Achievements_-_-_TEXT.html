üWe have registered our team: see our team page here . We had a great summer- visit our gallery for some proof!  Lastly, we will definitely be attending the Giant Jamboree.
üWe have successfully completed and submitted our Judging Form .
üWe have created and shared the description of our project using this wiki (see Project Overview for a short summary) and have documented our parts: BBa_K1674000 , BBa_K1674001 , BBa_K1674002 , BBa_K1674003 , BBa_K1674004 , BBa_K1674005 using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
üWe have planned our informative poster to present at the Giant Jamboree poster session, as well as our presentation to present at the Giant Jamboree presentation session.
üWe have created a wiki page to thank our mentors and all the people that helped and supported us in turning our idea into reality. The page includes attributions to various people for the help they gave us throughout our project.
üWe have documented a new BioBrick of secretion signal-peptide for B. subtilis - BBa_K1674000 and have submitted this part to the iGEM Registry.  This part is also our best new basic part .
Silver Medal Requirements
üWe have experimentally validated the following new BioBricks and have documented their characterization in the iGEM Parts Registry:
Secretion signal peptide for B. subtilis- BBa_K1674000
3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from rat liver:
On its own- BBa_K1674001
Under the pT7 promoter- BBa_K1674002
zwf gene which encodes the enzyme Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase:
On its own- BBa_K1674004
Under the pT7 promoter- BBa_K1674005
üWe have submitted our new BioBricks to the iGEM Parts Registry:
3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from rat liver:
On its own- BBa_K1674001
Under the pT7 promoter- BBa_K1674002
With the pT7 promoter and a reporter gene- tsPurple- BBa_K1674003
zwf gene which encodes the enzyme Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase:
On its own- BBa_K1674004
Under the pT7 promoter- BBa_K1674005
üWe asked important questions beyond the bench: we conducted surveys , asking the public about their concerns when they use bacterial products in general and our product in particular. We also carried out thorough safety research relating to our product to ensure a safe working environment in the lab and a safe product for consumers.
Gold Medal Requirements
üWe expanded on our human practices activities: We organized a focus group asking about our product design.  We integrated the results into our design page
üWe collaborated with a new high school team by mentoring the team both within and outside the lab.  We also hosted a Mini Jamboree event to provide a platform for all the Israeli iGEM teams to present their projects and get feedback and tips for improvement.
üWe have created a functional prototype: We created a prototype that includes two types of bacteria - B. subtilis and E. coli, in a special 3D-printed container: a comb.  We demonstrated how our prototype works under real-world conditions which we simulated in the lab.  Click here for more information.
