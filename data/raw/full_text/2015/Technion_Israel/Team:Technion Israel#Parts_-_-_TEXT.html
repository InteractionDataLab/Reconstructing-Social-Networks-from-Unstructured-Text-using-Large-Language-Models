The Design
The 3α-HSD is secreted from B. subtilis as a pre-protein fused to the Secretion Signal Peptide. At the same time, the G6PD is expressed in E. coli to overproduce NADPH, a cofactor of the 3α-HSD enzyme.
Both bacteria are placed in a syringe with a membrane that prevents the exit of E. coli onto the user's scalp. The medium with the B. subtilis is transferred to the scalp by a special 3-D printed comb.
On the scalp, the 3α-HSD catalyzes the reduction of DHT to 3α-androstanediol with NADPH from the E. coli as a cofactor.
An illustration of this concept can be  seen in Figure 1 below.

Our Favorite New Parts
Secretion Signal Peptide, BBa_K1674000 : Originated from the B.subtilis extracellular protease AprE. This signal peptide is routed via the Sec export-dependent pathway.
3α-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase - 3α-HSD, BBa_K1674001 : Specific dehydrogenase originated from rat liver. Catalyzes the conversion of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to 3α-androstanediol.
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase - G6PD (zwf), BBa_K1674004 : G6PD is a key enzyme since it catalyzes the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway, which is the main resource of NADPH in the cell.
Best Basic Part
We believe that our biobrick: BBa_K1674000 is a pretty great basic part.  Go to the page for this Basic Part to learn more.
