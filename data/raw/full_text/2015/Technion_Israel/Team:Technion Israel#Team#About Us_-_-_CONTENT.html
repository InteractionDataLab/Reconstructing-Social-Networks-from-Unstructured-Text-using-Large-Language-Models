					About me: “I’m 25 years old, born in Minsk, Belarus and raised in a small Israeli Town. I just finished my BSc. in Biotechnology and Food Engineering, with the intention  to open my own startup in the future. I love to laugh, listen to great music and have fun with my friends. I worked as a professional video editor in my past, I love working and managing creative projects”.
				</P><P>
					Alexey's role in project:  “Alexey is the producer of the project. Not only was the idea for the project something he originally suggested, but he could also be counted on to know largely what was going on with all the subgroups. Alexey was also the producer of all the videos which relate to our project and which can be found in the human practices section and main page of this wiki. Alexey also took part in the <B>expression</B> component of the project.
				</P><P>
					What makes you bold: “My out-of-the box thinking. Plus, I’m Russian”.

					About me: “I’m 23 years old and was born in California, USA.  I moved to Israel 11 years ago.  I am now in my 4th and last year of my BSc. in Biotechnology and Food Engineering at Technion.  I love traveling and running.”
				</P><P>
					Yael’s part in wiki:  Yael worked together with Roni on the <B>cofactor</B> component of the project. She is also largely responsible for the content of this (awesome!) wiki.
				</P><P>
					What makes you bold: “My diligence”.
				</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="person_wrapper" style="width: 100%;"><DIV class="left_container" style="width: 300px; height: 400px; float: right;"><H3>Tal Ofek<SMALL>“Master Starter”</SMALL></H3><P>
				About me: “I’m 26 years old, just finished my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology and Food Engineering, and about to start my master’s degree at the same faculty, in the microbiology of pathogens lab. I love decorating cakes and swimming.”
			</P><P>
				Tal's role in project: Tal could almost always be found in the lab. She worked restlessly on the <B>secretion</B> component of our project, continuously trying and trying again when necessary.
			</P><P>
				What makes you bold: “Ctrl+b”
			</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="person_wrapper" style="width: 100%;"><DIV class="left_container" style="width: 300px; height: 400px; float: left;"><H3>Roni Cohen<SMALL>“PCR Princess”</SMALL></H3><P>
					About me: “I’m 26, and studying Biotechnology and Food Engineering because of my great passion for life science, combined with the fact that I'm kind of practical. I love to create - whether it's DIY arts&amp;crafts or cooking in the kitchen (did anyone mention food science?!).”
				</P><P>
					Roni's role in project: Roni was another team member that could always be found in the lab. She worked non-stop on developing the <B>cofactor</B> for our project. The success seen in the results is largely credited to her perseverance even in the face of bad results.
				</P><P>
					What makes you bold: “I’m not afraid to speak my mind”

				About me: “I’m 26 years old, and I got married six months ago to the love of my life. I love to explore and discover new things in biology as part of my B.Sc. degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering I just finished cum laude”
			</P><P>
				Adi’s role in the project: “Adi could always be counted on in the lab, working mostly on the <B>expression</B> component of our project. Adi's successes would never let us down and could never be confused with anyone else's- she showed expression blatantly by growing purple bacteria using the BBa_K1357008 BioBrick from the 2015 DNA Distribution Kit. Additionally, she was also on top of the requirements for the medals for the competition, as well as the relevant deadlines.”

				What makes you bold: “My long hair”

					About me: “I’m 24 year old, just finished my B.Sc. in Biochemical Engineering and looking forward to start working as an engineer and exploring new challenges in places where biology meets engineering. ”
				</P><P>
					Ruth’s part in the project: Our project would have been a lot messier without Ruth.  Ruth worked on the <I><B>secretion</B></I> part of our project, but was also in charge of the lab.  We would never be kept waiting more than a few minutes for the necessary materials, and her expertise in various protocols made her the go-to person for most questions we had.
				</P><P>
					What makes you bold: “Stay calm and pipette on”.
				</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="person_wrapper" style="width: 100%;"><DIV class="left_container" style="width: 322px; height: 455px; float: right;"><H3>Liron Abrahami<SMALL>“Primer-dimer”</SMALL></H3><P>
				About me: “ I’m 26 year old, starting my fourth and last year in my Bachelor’s studies in Biotechnology and Food Engineering I love art as well as science so I hope that in the future I will be able to combine both. ”
			</P><P>
				Liron’s role in the project:  Liron was not only a part of the group working on the secretion project, she was also our own personal designer...for everything! Our shirts, poster, wiki, and Powerpoint presentation would have been extremely boring in comparison, if not for Liron's fantastic artistic skills.
			</P><P>
				What makes you bold: “I look at a problem as a challenge”

					About me: “I’m 22, just had my M.Sc. seminar - the team’s mechanical engineer. I studied mechanical engineering at the material and deposits department, and my thesis talks about the mutual effects between dislocations. Vegetarian, love running, indie music, and good people.”
				</P><P>
					Sagi’s role in the project: Sagi joined our team later on, but definitely pulled his weight in helping us develop the comb. The comb and syringe, along with their uniform distribution properties, is largely thanks to Sagi's help.
				</P><P>
					What makes you bold: “First of all - my beard. Then my super-fun charisma and modesty. But seriously, my family.”

				About me: “I’m 25 years old and just finished my BSc. in Chemical Engineering. I’m a really happy person who loves to laugh, go out and have fun. One of my favorite things is to arrange events down to the smallest detail!
			</P><P>
				Maayan's role in the project:  Maayan was our poster child for <B>human practices</B> and <B>collaborations</B>. She constantly took initiative, teaching the course we gave to the Technion high school team and planning the Mini-Jamboree. She also worked restlessly on developing the comb.  The comb would not have been possible without her perseverance.
			</P><P>
				What makes you bold: “Standing in front of a crowd”

					About me: “I’m 26, on the last year of my BSc. in Electrical Engineering. I love to travel, photograph beautiful shots, and listen to great music (metal). ”
				</P><P>
					Nitzan’s role in the project: Nitzan was the mastermind behind our model and wiki. Having more extensive experience in coding than the rest of our team, he set up the basics for the website, as well as the fancier components such as the dropdown menu and the homepage. In parallel, he worked on a complex model, always taking him further and further into the bolts and cofactors of the biology behind our project.
