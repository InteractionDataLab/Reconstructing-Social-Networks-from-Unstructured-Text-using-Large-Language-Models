Our project would not have been possible without the help of various people.
Our Advisors
We would have been completely at loss about the competition and how to go about starting our project, if not for our advisors from the lab of Dr. Roee Amit at the Biotechnology and Food Engineering faculty at Technion.  They were always available to chat about problem-solving and creative  solutions to obstacles along the way.  Their patience left us awe-struck at times.  Thank you so much for all your help!
Dr. Roee Amit- As mentioned above, our iGEM project would not have been possible without Dr. Amit's lab.  Yes, that sounds cliche, but its completely true.  Dr. Amit is the driving force behind iGEM at Technion, and his lab's never-ending and non-stop availability for helping students makes participation in the competition possible. Other members of the lab who helped us:
Inbal Vaknin
Lior Levy
Noa Katz
Michal Meirom
Dr. Orna Atar
Dr. Sarah Goldberg
