Hi! I am the team leader. I am on my third year of biotechnology engineering. Before I started to study biotechnology I was a professional swimmer. After finishing my career, I plan to start my over-graduate studies in marine biotechnology while I manage to bring biotech products to the market that will have a positive impact in the lives of people. We started Graph-Gene with the goal to take it beyond an academic project. We’ve still got a long journey to go but we are sure that both graphene and synthetic biology will play an important role in the new technological revolution, and we want to be part of it.

I’m currently on my second year of Biotechnology Engineering. I’m participating in the social part of the project as well as the lab work. I’m very passionate about my career because I believe it will provide me with the tools I need to achieve my goal in life: not to be just another human that roamed the Earth, but instead be someone that was useful to our world and gave back all that was received.

I deal with the legal aspects of our work, especially with intellectual property and copyrights. I also work in the lab with my teammates. I’ve always loved classical music. I started studying piano when I was 4 years old and violin by the time I was 11 years old.

I firmly believe you have to enjoy what you do to get it right. Working on this project has been a big challenge to all the team, but the technological, social and economic potential it has, makes it completely worth it. I am helping to develop our social and human side of the project. My passion is to learn and I love to read, dance and travel.

I am in charge of the chemical lab work of this project. I make sure that all the chemical processes that are needed to make graphene are working fine. Some of my hobbies are playing the guitar and learning how to cook.

Besides being a Professor of Biotechnology at Tecnologico de Monterrey at Guadalajara, I am also the coach and advisor to the team. I am always in awe of the energy, creativity and drive of young people.
I have lived and worked in the UK, Mauritius, Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras and now  Mexico . I have a keen interest in the regulation and biosafety of synthetic biology and its potential for education in biological sciences.
I feel the voice of youth should be heard in  biotechnology  and synthetic biology  oversight and regulatory circles.

I am in charge of the business development and project management of Graph-Gene.
I like to work with technology and innovation projects because they require truly research and passion. From a business perspective we always try to sell the products but sometimes we miss some important things, and dynamic groups of people bring that A-game that transforms a good project into an excellent project, because everything we do, must be done in the pursuit of value.
During my free time I like to hang out, cook, play guitar, basketball and videogames.
