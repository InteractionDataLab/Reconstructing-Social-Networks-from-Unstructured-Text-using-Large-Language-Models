Protocols
Synthesis of Graphene Oxide
Mix 3 g of graphite with 18 g of potassium permangante
Mix 360 mL of sulfuric acid with 40 mL of phosforic acid and let it cool down at 4 °C for 30 min
Combine both mixtures on an ice bath
Incubate at 50 °C, 700 rpm for 12 h
Let it cool down to room temperature and pour on 200 mL of distilled ice
Add 3 mL of hydrogen peroxide (35%)
This protocol is based on the work of Marcano et al (2010) .
Reduction of Graphene Oxide
To obtain reduced graphene oxide we followed and made some modifications to the method described by Abdolhosseinzadeh, Asgharzadeh & Kim (2015) .
Restriction Enzyme Digestion
Set up the following reaction
Component
Quantity
DNA
1 µg
10X NEBuffer 2.1
5 µL (1X)
EcoRI
1.0 µL (10 units)
PstI
1.0 µL (10 units)
Nuclease-free Water
to 50 µL
Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min
Incubate at 80 °C for 20 min
This protocol was adapted from NEBcloner™ .
Ligation
Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice
Component
Quantity
10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
2 µL (1X)
Vector DNA
25 ng
Insert DNA
60 ng
T4 DNA Ligase
1.0 µL
Nuclease-free Water
to 20 µL
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down, and microfuge briefly
Incubate at 16 °C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes
Incubate at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate enzymes
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 µl of the reaction into 50 µl competent cells
This protocol was adapted from NEBcloner™ . We also used NEBioCalculator™ the required insert mass.
1% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Gel Preparation
Add 0.5 g of agarose to 50 mL of 1X TAE buffer
Heat in microwave until the gel is homogeneous
Let the gel cool down to 40 °C before adding 1 μL of SYBR Safe®
Pour into a gel tray with the well comb in place
Let the gel sit at room temperature until it solidifies completely
Remove comb and place the gel into the gel box
Fill the gel box with 1X TAE buffer
Sample Load
Add SDS-containing loading buffer (6X) to the samples to a final concentration of 1X
Incubate at 65 °C for 10 min
Chill down on ice for 2 min
Vortex gently and centrifuge
Load molecular ladder into the gel's first lane
Carefully load the rest of the samples
Gel Run
Connect elecrodes and turn on the power source
Run the gel at 90 V until the tracking dye is about 80% of the way down the gel
Turn off the power source and disconnect the electrodes
Transfer the gel from the gel box to a UV tray
Visualize DNA using a gel imaging system
Bacterial Transformation
Thaw a tube of NEB 5-α competent E. coli cells on ice until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 µL of cells into a transformation tube on ice
Add 1-5 µL containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix
Heat shock at exactly 42 °C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix
Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix
Pipette 950 µL of room temperature SOC into the mixture
Place at 37 °C for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (300 rpm) or rotate
Warm selection plates to 37 °C
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting, then spread 10, 25, 50, and 75 µL in SOC
Incubate 8-12 hours to overnight at 37°C
This protocol was adapted from NEBCloner™ .
Plasmid DNA Preparation
Isolate colonies and inoculate 4 mL of LB supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 μg⁄mL)
Incubate with shaking for 12-18 h at 37 °C
Centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 3 min and discard the supernatant
Resuspend the pellet with 150 μL of solution 1. Transfer the solution into a new 1.5-mL microtube
Add 300 μL of solution 2 and mix by inversion. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min
Add 225 μL of solution 3 and mix by inversion. Incubate in ice for 5 min
Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes and recover the supernatant
Add 800 μL of isopropanol, mix by inversion and incubate for 5 min in ice
Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 6 minutes and discard supernatant
Wash the pellet with ethanol (70%)  and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 1 min
Discard the supernatant and dry the pellet
Resuspend DNA in 100 μL of Milli-Q water
BioBrick™ Submission
Sterilize the hood surface with 70% ethanol
Cover the 96 well plate with the provided plate lid (not with the adhesive foil)
Place the plate in the hood
With sufficient airflow, drying down 10 μL (25 ng⁄μL) of purified plasmid DNA in the plate should take four hours
Once all wells have dried, cover the plate with the provided adhesive foil
We obtained this protocol from iGEM .
