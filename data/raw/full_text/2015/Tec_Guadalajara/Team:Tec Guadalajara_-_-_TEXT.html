Project description: GraphGene
Graphene is a revolutionary material that does not cease to amaze us given the wide range of applications it can have within different industries such as health, solar, electronics, automotive, energy storage, communications, sensors, and so on. Specifically, a high quality and cost effective type of graphene known as reduced graphene oxide or rGO (which is an almost pure material that shares many of graphene's applications), is easily obtained. Its process only involves the oxidation of graphite to graphene oxide followed by the latter's reduction to rGO . So, if the process is simple enough and graphene's applications are so promising, why isn't it widely available for  industry and the many  markets it could benefit? The answer lies  in a non-existant large-scale production. Currently, the reducing agent that is normally used in the last step of the process is hydrazine, a highly toxic and mutagenic compound! For this reason, researchers have tested and looked for other compounds that can replace hydrazine. Our team, GraphGene has found one, and our  main focus is to engineer a yeast strain capable of producing this compound which will enable us to develop a sustainable and large-scale production of graphene.
