Online forum
Intended to replicate the real discussion from parties and observers of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD, part of United Nations) that took place recently in preparation for next year’s Conference and Meeting of the Parties of the Cartagena Protocol otherwise known as COP-MOP, which will be held in Cancun, Mexico. So far, the more distinctive results have been:
Although we discussed a various number of synthetic biology definitions in our forum, we can point out that every single one of them have something in common, such as concepts like: new, design, synthesis, standardizing, engineering, creation, accelerating processes, making things easier (within this context). Therefore, through the attempt to find and rely on a middle ground, we can say that synthetic biology is about innovation and progress within modern biotechnology. That is why, as a conclusion, we reached the consensus that the European Union definition of synthetic biology is the one that aligns the best with us, which is “Synthetic biology is the application of science, technology and engineering to facilitate and accelerate the design, manufacture and/or modification of genetic materials in living organisms”
UN/COP-MOP Youth Group
In addition, we are organizing a youth group that will participate as an observer during the COP-MOP to get more involved in the policy process that is shaping our discipline.
