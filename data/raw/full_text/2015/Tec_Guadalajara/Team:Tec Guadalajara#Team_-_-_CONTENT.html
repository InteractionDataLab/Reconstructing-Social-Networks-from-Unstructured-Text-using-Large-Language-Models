I am the team leader. I am on my third year of biotechnology engineering. Before I started to study biotechnology I was a professional swimmer. After finishing my career, I plan to start my over-graduate studies in marine biotechnology while I manage to bring biotech products to the market that will have a positive impact in the lives of people. We started Graph-Gene with the goal to take it beyond an academic project. We’ve still got a long journey to go but we are sure that both graphene and synthetic biology will play an important role in the new technological revolution, and we want to be part of it.</P></DIV></LI><LI id="regina"><DIV class="img" title="Meet Regina Rendon">Regina Rendon</DIV><DIV class="bio"><P><SPAN class="name">Regina Rendon</SPAN><SPAN class="age">19 years old</SPAN></P><P>I am in charge of the logistics and financing of the project.
