We have compiled several activities through a Science Communication Program such as a Transgenics Debate between one of our assessors and a Greenpeace representative, a Biotech Science Fair and the design of a SynBio Lab practice for HighSchool Students.
Last but not least, we want to help other universities’ teams in Latin-America countries to get started in Synthetic Biology through an online platform called “Synbio: sin Fronteras” (SynBio without Borders), where the main objective is to promote science and technology among young people through iGEM teams:
Host Lab
iGEMers Exchange
Contact Network
