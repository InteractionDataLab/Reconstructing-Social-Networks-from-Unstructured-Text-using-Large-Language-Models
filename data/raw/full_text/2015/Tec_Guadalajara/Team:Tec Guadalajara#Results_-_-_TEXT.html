SEM image of graphite and reduced graphene oxide. Graphite arranges in agglomerates while reduced graphene oxide shows clear separated sheets.
IR (infrared spectroscopy) spectra of graphite, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide. Graphite shows double bond C=C; graphene oxide have C-H, C=O, C=C and C-O; and reduced graphene oxide C=C and C-O.
EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) results from graphite and reduced graphene oxide, respectively. The graph corresponding to graphite shows characteristic spectra with no hyperfine interactions; on the other hand, reduced graphene oxide clearly shows hyperfine interactions due to its electrical properties.
