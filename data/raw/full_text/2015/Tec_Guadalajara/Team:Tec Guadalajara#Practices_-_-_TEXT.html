3 Rs
The science is exciting, but we are also aware of the implications that technology can have on society. Therefore, we have worked on the interphase between science and society with an initiative called “The three R’s”: regulation, rights and relations. Within each area we have collaborated with experts that have enabled us to work responsibly in our project by getting involved in social issues that affect us all as a SYTHETIC BIOLOGY COMMUNITY.
