The pathway from glucose to IA is already known in Penicillium. It consists of two steps catalyzed by two enzymes.
Oxidation of D-glucose to D-glucono-1,5-lactone by glucose oxidase (GOX)
Oxidation of D-gluconolactone to D-isoascorbic acid by D-gluconolactone oxidase (GLO)
D-isoascorbic acid biosynthetic pathway
Both genes were optimized for Pichia pastoris and synthesized. Our chassis was methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris GS115.
Gene optimization
No P. pastoris strains to overcome codon bias
Codon optimization strategies are usually based on Kazusa's codon usage database
We used the COOL web tool using Bai et al's (2011) codon table based on highly expressed genes
Vector design
Design of our shuttle vector for E. coli and P. pastoris
PGAP
Î±-MF
P2A
Strong constitutive expression
Same strength as PAOX1
One-step cultivation procedure
Shortened protein production time (no induction)
No glucose, alcohol, or glycerol repression
Effective secretory expression
pre-region: nascent protein is directed to the endoplasmatic reticulum post-translationally
pro-region: protein is transferred to Golgi apparatus
Eases protein purification and qualitative analysis
Cis-acting hydrolase element
Expresses multiple proteins in a single ORF
Already used for co-expression in P. pastoris
Single transformation
Balanced coexpression
Overall cost is reduced
Advantages of biological reduction of GO
The production of isoascorbic acid by using P. pastoris allows us to:
Reduce GO without compromising operator's health and environment
Scale-up the process. However, it must be improved to be economically feasible
Show proof of concept to move from a chemical to a biological process
