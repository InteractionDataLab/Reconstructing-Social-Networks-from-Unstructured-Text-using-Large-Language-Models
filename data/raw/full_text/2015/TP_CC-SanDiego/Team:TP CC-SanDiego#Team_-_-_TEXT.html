ABHISHEK CHAKRABORTY
LAB TEAM / POSTER TEAM
I joined TP_CC iGem because it gave me an opportunity pursue my passion for biology as it incorporated research, practical experience and presentational skills. I am very interested in what synthetic biology can do for medicine and hope to one day become a neurologist or neurosurgeon. In my free time, I enjoy walking my dog and watching detective movies.
ABISHEK CHOZHAN
WEB TEAM CO-LEADER
I am interested in iGEM because I believe that biological engineering is a powerful tool that can determine the future of mankind. I also love to mountain bike and program websites! I love to teach programming to younger kids as well!
AIDAN KAHNG
LAB TEAM
I am a part of the TP_CC iGEM team primarily to deepen my understanding of molecular biology as well as dabble in basic lab work and research concerning synthetic biology as I am interested in pursuing a career in bio-medical research. Some of my hobbies include cooking, playing ultimate frisbee, table tennis, and running long distance. I like k-pop. That about sums up my life.
ALICE JIN
HUMAN PRACTICES LEADER
I joined iGem because it allows me to get together with fellow students who are as interested in biology and science as I am. Through my role in Human Practices, I seek to make synthetic biology more accessible to the public. In my free time, I like to read, draw, and eat.
ANDREW RIM
LAB TEAM
I am a part of iGEM because it offers me a wonderful experience in conducting research in synthetic biology and overall helping our community in solving problems that affect each and every one of us. Biological research is something that I am interested in pursuing in the future, and this was one way of helping enrich my experiences in research. In my free time, I enjoy playing cello, guitar, basketball, tennis, or taking long walks on the beach.
ANTHONY KANG
LAB TEAM CO-LEADER
I am interested in synthetic biology because the creative potential it holds for applications in multidisciplinary fields, and iGEM provides the opportunity to get involved with the synbio movement and research. If I’m not a school or in the lab, you can find me training at the pool or sleeping on my homework.
CAROLINE ZHANG
PROJECT LEADER / LAB TEAM
I joined TP_CC iGem because it not only combined my interests in science, community outreach, and entrepreneurship, but also provided an opportunity to do hands-on research and lab work in synthetic biology. In the future, I am interested in a career in bioengineering, especially  its medical applications. Outside of the lab, I like running nature trails, writing short stories, playing basketball, and coding.
CATHERINE JUNG
LAB TEAM
I joined iGEM because of the lab experience and the chance to work with my peers who share my passion for biology. It's unique in that your team gets to design an entire experiment from scratch and you get to be a part of the entire process. My hobbies include playing flute, piano, biking, hiking, and playing video games.
DANIEL RIM
POSTER TEAM
I joined iGEM because I love synthetic biology and wanted more experience with it. Our research is also closely tied to issues that plague where I live too. I hope to pursue a career in biology, so this is great experience. In my free time, I play violin and bass guitar, and eat.
EDRIC XIANG
VICE CAPTAIN / WEB TEAM CO-LEADER
I'm joined iGEM because I love... programming! After completing a bioinformatics internship, I branched out my interests into biology and joined our iGEM team. I've put my coding skills to good use (and picked up a lot of web development experience along the way!) while contributing to the team wiki. Outside of iGEM I love hiking around San Diego and skiing the local slopes.
GITANJALI MULTANI
LAB TEAM / POSTER TEAM
I am a part of TP_CC iGEM because it is a wonderful opportunity to engage in the process of creating a project and conducting research. In my free time, I enjoy watching crime shows, Marvel movies, running track, and catching up on my sleep. Here’s something for all of you to think about, “you have to be odd to be number one (Dr. Seuss).”
JODIE HOH
POSTER TEAM LEADER
I am part of TP_CC iGem to learn more about the different types of sciences that exist in everyday life and to enhance my experience in working as a team with a group of people. I like to watch Anime, make cup noodles, play League of Legends, and do taekwondo. I like to watch cooking shows in my free time.
JONATHAN KUO
HUMAN PRACTICES / POSTER TEAM
I joined iGEM because I thought that exploring the field of synthetic biology would be interesting, since I did not have much experience with it. and the potential applications of synthetic biology seemed useful. Through iGEM I have been able to see both the benefits and limitations of synthetic biology, and have been able to try to explore those ideas. In my spare time I like playing video games and watching shows on Netflix.
JONATHAN WANG
LAB TEAM
I joined iGEM because it allows me to contemplate solutions to common problems that currently face my community. Additionally, I am greatly interested in synthetic biology and hands-on research opportunities, so I was very excited to be a part of this team. In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, tennis, reading, spending time with friends, and watching Marvel movies.
MADELINE SONG
LAB TEAM
I joined TP_CC iGEM because I knew there was more to science than biology textbooks and high school classrooms.  iGEM was a perfect combination of  lab work and research but also community outreach. When I'm not in the lab, I'm fencing, scrimmaging with my Mock Trial team, learning to write code, and (if it's the weekend) eating brunch!
NATHAN LIAN
TEAM CAPTAIN / LAB TEAM CO-LEADER
I joined TP_CC iGEM because of my deep interest in biology and its many implications across various fields. While I primarily focused on the bioinformatics aspect of biology prior to joining this team, I eventually began to shift my focus to the wet lab aspects of molecular biology, particularly those involved in synthetic biology. If I’m not at school or in the lab, you can find me gasping for air on the track or screaming at the TV with facepaint on watching the game.
NATHAN RIM
POSTER TEAM
I joined iGem because it provided a great opportunity to enhance my knowledge  and experience in synthetic/molecular biology. I love iGem because I was able to participate in a project that was brainstormed created together by a team students like myself, making the project feel so much more personal and rewarding. In my free time, I love playing viola, drums, and tennis. I also think DC is better than Marvel.
PATRICIA OUYANG
LAB TEAM / POSTER TEAM
I joined iGEM because I wanted to gain lab experience and explore synthetic biology, since I didn’t know much about either topic. The information I’ve learned throughout the year is very interesting and I hope to build on my synthetic biology knowledge in the future. When I have free time I enjoy drawing and listening to music.
PRIYANKA MULTANI
LAB TEAM / POSTER TEAM
I joined TP_CC iGem because I wanted to gain hands-on experience with lab work as well as enhance my knowledge of synthetic and molecular biology. In my free time, I enjoy running track, watching cricket with my family and spending time with my friends. I also love anything and everything to do with Marvel!
RACHEL LIAN
POSTER TEAM
I joined iGEM last year when I became interested in synthetic biology after doing a research project for a class. Since then, that interest has grown and I have really enjoyed designing with the Poster Team, discussing ideas, and doing research. In my free time, I enjoy anything to do with art and music.
DANE MALANGONE
LAB TEAM
I am part of my school’s iGem team because it is a great opportunity to get experience in a lab setting as well as augment my knowledge and understanding of synthetic biology. Some of my hobbies include reading, sleeping, and anything to do with computers.
