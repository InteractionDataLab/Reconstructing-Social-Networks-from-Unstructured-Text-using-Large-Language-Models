WEEK 1
Day 1 afternoon: August 3, 2015: (Nathan, Aidan, Abhi)
SUMMARY:
Transformation of E. coli Dh5-alpha with ordered plasmid.
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Culture GOOD bacterial colonies
Replate colonies on LB+Amp Agar plates and incubate at 37deg C
Create 2-3 new plates of transformed E. coli, following the same procedure as above - aliquot 5uL of the plasmid to prevent contamination of the "master broth"
Day 2 morning: August 4, 2015: (Caroline, Patricia, Dane, Abhi)
WHAT WE FOUND:
No colonies on either plate-> put both plates back in the incubator
SUMMARY:
Transformation of E. coli Dh5-alpha with ordered plasmid. (we used 2.5 ul diluted plasmid as opposed to the 1 ul used yesterday)
Made changes to transformation protocol-> centrifuged to concentrate bacteria
Day 2 afternoon: August 4, 2015: (Nathan)
SUMMARY:
Checked on plates
Day 3 afternoon: August 5, 2015: (Nathan, Anthony, Catherine, Madeline)
WHAT WE FOUND:
Colonies grew on both plates from August 4; plates from August 3 still had no colonies
SUMMARY:
Streak plated colonies from the more populated of the two original plates onto two more
Created 6 LB+Amp plates
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Nathan - autoclave remaining LB+Agar to create additional plates because LB+Amp agar solidified; make more plates
IPTG induction and SDS Page
Day 4 morning: August 6, 2015: (Caroline, Patricia)
SUMMARY:
Made part of the solutions for the page gel
Recipes for gels on instruction paper in iGEM box or this helpful website below http://www.assay-protocol.com/molecular-biology/electrophoresis/denaturing-page
PROCEDURE:
Calculated Protein Size (LbCHI31) by entering amino acid sequence in http://web.expasy.org/compute_pi/ : 33 kDa
Made a Stacking Gel solution and Separating Gel solution for 12% Gel (we added everything except APS & TEMED which should be in the 4C fridge)
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Finish making gels (instruction sheet in iGEM box): solutions are in 15mL falcon tubes on the iGEM 4C fridge rack
Run SDS Page
Make Stock solutions(if you have time) for 10% SDS, 1.5 M Tris(ph=8.8), and 0.5M Tris-HCl(ph=6.8) so that we don’t have to keep using other people’s
Day 4 afternoon: August 6, 2015: (Aidan, Catherine, Patricia, Anthony, Jonathan)
SUMMARY:
We made 2 12% page gels
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Make more stock solutions for future use (maybe 1.5M Tris ph 8.8, 1.0M Tris ph 6.8, 10% SDS, TAE buffer)
http://openwetware.org/wiki/Qiagen_Buffers We should make sure we have tools necessary to conduct minipreps
Basically stock up on things we will be needing in the future to make more gels, run said gels, conduct miniprep, western blots
Next week Monday we will likely make an overnight saturated culture of our E.Coli and run a miniprep (if we can) on Tuesday
Day 5 morning: August 7, 2015: (Patricia, Caroline, Catherine) Time: 09:30 - 12:00
SUMMARY:
We made 10% SDS Solution, 1.0M Tris pH 6.8, and 1.5m Tris pH 8.8
All three solutions are stored at room temperature.
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
-Create TAE Buffer.
Day 5 afternoon: August 7, 2015: (Aidan, Madeline, Priya ) 2:35-3:30
SUMMARY:
Made 200mL LB broth for future use and saturated culture.
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Probably remake a saturated overnight culture (LB + e.Coli + incubate overnight)
Make some TAE buffer (if we need to)
WEEK 2

Day 6 afternoon: August 10, 2015: (Anthony, Liana, Nathan, Dane, Edric)
SUMMARY:
Ran a gel for SDS Page analysis (Ladder, control, and three copies of the samples)
Staining gel in Coomassie Blue overnight
WHAT TO DO NEXT: (Just making notes here for the rest of this week- Nathan)
Analyze SDS page results and see if procedure worked well (Monday afternoon = test run) - Tuesday morning + afternoon
Make one set of stacking gels for an SDS run to save time on Wednesday (if possible) - Tuesday afternoon
Two sets of stacking gels for two more runs of SDS page - Wednesday afternoon
Prepare LB+Amp+colony vs LB+e.coli for SDS page runs - Thursday morning
Run both gels at the same time in SDS gel box - Thursday afternoon
Analyze gel results (expression) - Friday morning and afternoon

Create 2 more gels:
Solutions w/o AP and TEMED are on the rack in 15 ml tubes
Gel rig is on bench with only one set of gels
Follow procedure from Day 4 and finish gels
Day 7 afternoon: August 11, 2015 (Nathan, Caroline, Liana, Dane, Abhi)
SUMMARY:
Made 2 12% stacking gels (remade gel solutions from morning)
Stained and destained gel from Monday (used new Coomassie instead of used one)
Performed Gel Analysis -> no results
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Morning:
Do Transformation and grow on 2 new LB+Amp plates → use Day 2 morning procedure for this
Create new culture of LB+sample -> 3 samples
IMPORTANT: REHYDRATE OLD GEL
Afternoon:
Run two new gels for SDS page -> IMPORTANT: Load the ladder, the 3 samples that Caroline and Nathan made, and the 3 samples that Liana and Nathan made
Stain and destain gels; scan; save → we can analyze through discussions later
Notes:
Run old SDS gel → use old plates as positive control for cells on new plates
Day 8 morning: August 12, 2015 (Nathan, Liana)
SUMMARY:
Made O/N (4-6 hour) LB+Amp+culture for SDS page
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Check old gel for dehydration - if not dehydrated, leave in wrap… if dehydrated, rehydrate
Run the two gels made on 8/11/15… Refer to 8/11/15 on notes regarding loading the gel (remember to keep the two end lanes open)
Aidan and Anthony run the gels
Madeline, Priya, Gita create two new plates (in 4 degC fridge)
Day 8 afternoon: August 12, 2015 (Aidan, Madeline, Dane, Priya, Gita)
SUMMARY:
Made 3 O/N saturated cultures and 1 control (in 37 degC shaker)
Day 9 morning: August 13, 2015 (Nathan, Caroline, Madeline, Catherine)
SUMMARY:
Ran an SDS Page gel (1 ladder, 3 samples, 3 buffer+SDS running dye (ensures that everything runs straight))
Made another saturated batch of LB+Amp+colony.
WHAT TO DO NEXT:
Stain and destain gel
Scan gel and upload with the light box
Use fluorescence to look for our GFP tag around 33 kDA (size of LbCHI31)
NOTES:
The reason we made another batch is because our plasmid, pUCIDT, is a custom plasmid off IDT that was selected by IDT to meet our lab requirements. Unfortunately, pUCIDT does not contain a lac operon (so no IPTG induction), is a DNA specific plasmid (so it doesn’t over express proteins, but it’ll still express just at a lower concentration, which is why we created a new batch with 6 mL of LB for greater growth. The logic behind this is, because we can’t use IPTG induction, we will detect the expression of our plasmid at 33 kDa via the GFP tag we linked to our protein), and does not have common restriction enzyme cut sites (eg. ECOR1, XBal, etc).
Day 9 evening: August 13, 2015 (Aidan, Anthony, Patricia)
SUMMARY:
Destained SDS Page gel from earlier today; left overnight on shaker in diH2O (step 11)
