Fungal infections have detrimental impacts in agriculture by decreasing crop yields. Particularly, Fusarium wilt, a fungal disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum, affects a wide variety of foodstuffs. Current treatments for Fusarium wilt involve the cultivation of resistant crops; however, ever-evolving fungal pathogens can circumvent those resistances and induce blight within the resistant crop strains. As a result, an inherent component of all fungal cell walls, chitin, was targeted to combat fungal infections in plants.

A diversely found glucose-derivative, chitin provides rigidity in all fungal species and also acts as a similar constituent of arthropod and insect exoskeletons and harder external tissues in various organisms. Our proposed mechanism for the antifungal treatment was to degrade chitin through the use of the enzyme chitinase. Various chitinase isozymes act upon the varying chitin structures in different organisms, so chitinase LbCHI31 was selected as the chitinase of choice for Fusarium oxysporum.

  </P><H2>Procedural Outline</H2><P>

The goal of this project was to engineer a bacterial strain capable of secreting viable chitinase to attack the cellular stability and structures of Fusarium oxysporum, thereby inducing structural collapse of the fungal cell wall. A plasmid containing genes encoding for LbCHI31 production and secretion was used to transform bacteria using standard heatshock and recovery protocols.

  </P><H2>Plasmid Design</H2><P>

The pBR322 plasmid was used as a base construct for the plasmid design. When designing the plasmid, the gene sequence for chitinase LbCHI31 was incorporated with a GFP tag and a linker into the plasmid. Since the GFP gene was linked to the LbCHI31, the presence of green fluorescence under UV exposure would indicate successful secretion of the GFP-LbCHI31 complex (i.e., since GFP is secreted, the linked the LbCHI31 product is consequently secreted). A signal peptide following the GFP tag was added and linked to the chitinase in order to signal the E. coli to begin type II secretion. The type II secretion system is generally utilized to secrete degradative enzymes such as chitinase. Additionally, the pBR322 contains inherent ampicillin resistance; as such, by using ampicillin as a selective agent, transformed e. coli was easily isolated and cultured.


In order to break down the chitin in the cell wall of fungus, our team has chosen to utilize E. coli and have them secrete a chitinase that will break down the chitin. Chitinases essentially break down glycosidic bonds in chitin, suggesting that by getting E. coli to secrete chitinases, we can successfully combat fungal infections. The particular chitinase we chose was LbCHI31, an enzyme that is known to be able to degrade the chitin in Fusarium oxysporum. Through transformation, we will introduce a plasmid with the gene that encodes for LbCHI31 into E. coli.

  </P><H2>Abstract</H2><P>

Microfungi that produce harmful mycotoxins flourish on improperly-stored nuts, grains, meat, and dairy. They especially thrive in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure causes 40% of the diseases. To lessen the problem, our team engineered E. coli strains using synthetic biology tools to produce chimeric mycotoxin-degrading fungal enzymes, Aflatoxin-Detoxifizyme (ADTZ) and Zearalenone Hydrolase (ZHD101), which are designed to be secreted to extra-cellular space by fusing with secretion signal peptides from alpha-amylase and beta-lactamase. In this study, we have successfully generated four chimeric mycotoxin-detoxifying enzymes. The levels of extracellular secretion is also characterized and analyzed. The project will allow a mass production of detoxification enzymes in cost effective way, preventing the squandering of harvested crops, and limiting mycotoxin-related diseases. Increased access to these proteins will have an immense commercial, industrial, agricultural, and health impact.

Our project would not cause any problem in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and environmental safety.</H4><P>We are Biosafety Level 1 (BSL1) and we use E.

The resistance to ampicillin may create a potential biohazard due to its inability to be killed with this specific antibiotic, however other types of antibiotics readily eliminate this bacteria. The ability to break down mycotoxins will benefit and not harm society.</P><P>The team has received biosafety training; all of the lab team members received online training created by UCSD. It covered all of the possible issues that could arise while in the lab, ranging from using the fume hood to regulatory affairs issues.</P><P>The team all received professional biosafety and laboratory safety training from a mentor, Dr. Holman. The lab team received additional official biosafety and laboratory safety training from the University of California, San Diego, and is approved by the Environmental Health &amp; Safety department. Possible hazards of microorganisms being released into the wild, methods of disaster prevention, laboratory techniques and safety precautions, and first aid measurements were all covered.</P><H4 dir="ltr">2. Although it is unlikely, if anything detrimental happens, the modified E. Coli...</H4><P>cannot cause any harm since the strain and final constructs we use are not pathogenic. Even if some sort of infection occurs, it would be minor and can be treated with a number of different antibiotics that we did not engineer resistance for in the cells. Other than possible infection, there is little risk to the environment since, as an invasive species, the cells have no special adaptations other than being resistant to ampicillin. To prevent a breach or to clean up a spill, simply treat the area with bleach or an alcohol solution. There are no security risks from malicious misuse; the bacteria again is innocuous and would not do much harm. To prevent such mistakes and containment breaches, we are sure to clean our lab stations as well as to be cautious with our mixtures and cultures.</P><H4 dir="ltr">3. No BioBrick part was submitted by our team this year.</H4><H4 dir="ltr">4.

Some of our ideas about how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions include…</H4><P>In order to prevent accidental spread of possible pathogenic or environmentally harmful strains of organisms, the organism could be engineered to become an auxotrophic organism; the bacteria would be largely unable to spread beyond the petri dish. This, however, might be disabled by evolutionary mechanisms, i.e. bacteria becoming able to resynthesize whatever amino acid they were engineered not to synthesize. Engineering an auxotrophic form of E. Coli might also be useful in reducing use of antibiotic resistance genes. The gene coding for an amino acid could be substituted for the antibiotic resistance gene, with all petri dishes containing essential amino acids, except one. This would ensure growth of just transformed bacteria. To prevent spread of the newly engineered parts, it might be ideal to integrate them into the bacterial chromosome, as to prevent spreading parts through bacterial conjugation. </P><P>For conducting the tests for our experiments, e.g. gel electrophoresis, there is little to report. The only major thing that should be improved on that has some safety risk is the handling of the hot agarose solution in gel electrophoresis. Instead of the hot-mitts that gives one a somewhat crab-like grip, it might be a better idea to provide hot mitts that enable a 5 fingered grip. Most of our other lab procedures are quite safe; for instance, we do not use UV light to determine banding for gel electrophoresis. Instead we use regular lighting due to our visualizing solution.</P><H5>RESULTS</H5><H4 dir="ltr"><P>SDS Page Gel Protein Test:</P><P>We tested two main parameters on our gels: pellets of BL21 transformed cells, Dh5Alpha transformed cells, BL21 wild-type, Dh5Alpha wild-type; and supernatants of BL21 wild-type and Dh5Alpha wild-type.
