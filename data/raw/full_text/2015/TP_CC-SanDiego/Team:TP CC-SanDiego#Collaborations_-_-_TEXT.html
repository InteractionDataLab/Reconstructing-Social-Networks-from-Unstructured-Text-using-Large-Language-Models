UCSD iGEM COLLABORATION
We met with the UCSD iGEM team on September 4th in the Bioengineering building of the Jacobs School of Engineering. During this meeting, we discussed the details of our project, including our goals, impacts, and progress. UCSD iGEM responded with their opinions on and insight into some of the key applications of our project. We also discussed various human practices tactics and UCSD iGEM shared helpful information on how to get funding and scholarships from biotech companies in our area.   The LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding gene, extracted from Limonium Bicolor by Zhihua Liu and his team at the Northeast Forestry University in China, has very limited background literature, thereby making it difficult to demonstrate LbCHI31â€™s effectiveness against fusarium oxysporum. We presented our idea to test chitinase on varying concentrations of chitin in a minimal media, and UCSD iGEM provided us with valuable bioinformatic advice regarding graphs and in silico protein modeling.
