I joined iGEM because of the lab experience and the chance to work with my peers who share my passion for biology. It's unique in that your team gets to design an entire experiment from scratch and you get to be a part of the entire process. My hobbies include playing flute, piano, biking, hiking, and playing video games.

I'm joined iGEM because I love... programming! After completing a bioinformatics internship, I branched out my interests into biology and joined our iGEM team. I've put my coding skills to good use (and picked up a lot of web development experience along the way!) while contributing to the team wiki. Outside of iGEM I love hiking around San Diego and skiing the local slopes.

						HUMAN PRACTICES / POSTER TEAM
					</H5><P>
I joined iGEM because I thought that exploring the field of synthetic biology would be interesting, since I did not have much experience with it. and the potential applications of synthetic biology seemed useful. Through iGEM I have been able to see both the benefits and limitations of synthetic biology, and have been able to try to explore those ideas. In my spare time I like playing video games and watching shows on Netflix.

I joined TP_CC iGEM because I knew there was more to science than biology textbooks and high school classrooms.  iGEM was a perfect combination of  lab work and research but also community outreach. When I'm not in the lab, I'm fencing, scrimmaging with my Mock Trial team, learning to write code, and (if it's the weekend) eating brunch!

						TEAM CAPTAIN / LAB TEAM CO-LEADER

I joined TP_CC iGEM because of my deep interest in biology and its many implications across various fields. While I primarily focused on the bioinformatics aspect of biology prior to joining this team, I eventually began to shift my focus to the wet lab aspects of molecular biology, particularly those involved in synthetic biology. If I’m not at school or in the lab, you can find me gasping for air on the track or screaming at the TV with facepaint on watching the game.

I joined iGem because it provided a great opportunity to enhance my knowledge  and experience in synthetic/molecular biology. I love iGem because I was able to participate in a project that was brainstormed created together by a team students like myself, making the project feel so much more personal and rewarding. In my free time, I love playing viola, drums, and tennis. I also think DC is better than Marvel.
