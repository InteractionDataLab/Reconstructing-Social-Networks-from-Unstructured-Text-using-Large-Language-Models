We had an opportunity to show our idea and receive comments during Q&amp;A sessions.
Particularly, one overgraduate team called Korea_U_Seoul team asked us why we used E.coli instead of other microorganisms. We answered that it is for accessibility. Since our project is headed toward the welfare of farmers, we focus on the technology that is “available” and “easy” for them to use.
</P><P>We also offered some opinions about two other teams. Three Korean teams collaborated to achieve better at Giant Jamboree. It was indeed a great time.</P><H4>#i GEM mentors</H4><P>Gha Young Lee, David Brown, Ricardo Chavez 
We have applied for Pilot Mentorship Program, and were able to meet three great mentors who had experienced Giant Jamboree. In particular, Gha Young helped us a lot. She shared her experience about preparing for Giant Jamboree. We can’t wait until meeting her at Boston :) Also, we have skyped twice during the summer vacation( 7/1/15 10AM and 8/17/15 11 PM in Korean time) and got advice about part submission, human practice and the purpose of our project.</P><H3> b. communicating with Bio Ethanol Research Institutes </H3><H4>#Jeon-nam University Bioethanol Research Institute 8/19</H4><P>We started exchangin emails with JU Bioethanol Research Institute on August 19th. We not only introduced our bioengineering project but also Our questions were related to the problems that this institute encounters during their research. It answered that the economic feasibility and construction of infrastructure were the main problem it often faces.</P><H3> c. Testing other teams’ systems</H3><P>We’ve tested some systems of other iGEM teams such as Korea_U_Seoul,Nankai and Paris-Bettencourt.
