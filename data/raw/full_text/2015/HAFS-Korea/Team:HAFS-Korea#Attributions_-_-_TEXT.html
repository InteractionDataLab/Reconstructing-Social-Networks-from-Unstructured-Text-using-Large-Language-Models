B. Project support and advice
Professor Heejun Myung(instructor)
Professor Heejoon Myung is a faculty member of Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. His research interest covers a wide variety of viruses including HCV, HIV, and bacteriophages.
Our team successfully contacted him by sending constant emails. If it had not been his generosity, we would not have been able to start our project. Before starting our experiment, he taught us how to construct primers and how to order them. He allowed us to use his laboratory whenever we wanted. Most important, he provided us with instructions on how to use lab safely. He always welcomed us with a big smile and refined but gentle accent.
