Collaborations
Since this is our university's first participation in iGEM, we asked many experienced iGEM teams for advice before we started. We got really helpful replies by the teams Frankfurt, Goettingen and Bielefeld.
Moreover we got visited by some members of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt, which told us about their project and listened to our project ideas, so that we could exchange views on these subjects. They also raised our awareness for a healthy atmosphere in the team, which is why we focused also on team building measures during our project.
We thank our sponsors:
