Working instructions
Competent Cells:
Reagents:
Cells
LB plate
LB medium
TB-PIPES buffer
Liquid nitrogen
Day 1:
Flame the metal inoculating loop
Scrape off a portion from the top of the frozen (DH5-alpha) cells
Streak it onto the LB plate
Put the stock back to -80 °C immediately
Leave the plates for 5 minutes and place them upside down in the 37 °C incubator overnight
Day 2:
Pick a single colony into 3 mL of LB medium
Inoculate the culture over night at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm
Transfer 0.5 mL of the overnight preculture into 50 mL LB medium (1-2 L Erlenmeyer flask)
Let the culture grow to OD600 = 0.6 at 18 °C with shaking at 200 rpm
Transfer the culture into a 50 mL Falcon tube and leave for 10 min on ice
Spin down cells at 3500 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C
Resuspend in 1/3 volume TB-PIPES buffer (17 mL for 50 mL original culture)
Leave for 10 min on ice
Spin down cells at 3500 rpm for 8 min at 4 °C
Resuspend in 1/12.5 volume ( 4 mL for 50 mL original culture)
Add 7% DMSO (sterile)
Leave for 10 min on ice
Aliquot 50 µL in pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes and freeze by immersion in liquid nitrogen
Store at −80 ° C
Transformation Efficiency ‘Competent Cell Test Kit’:
(iGEM Help: Transformation Efficiency Kit)
spin down DNA (0.5, 5, 10, 20 & 50 pg/µL RFP Construct BBa_J04450, pSB1C3) from Competent Cell Test Kit ( 30 sec, 10.000 rpm)
thaw competent cells on ice, label one 2 ml tube for each concentration + pre-chill
1 µl of DNA in each tube, respectively
add 50 µl of competent cells to each tube, incubate for 30 min on ice
pre-heat (42 °C), heat shock for 1 min
incubate for 5 min on ice
