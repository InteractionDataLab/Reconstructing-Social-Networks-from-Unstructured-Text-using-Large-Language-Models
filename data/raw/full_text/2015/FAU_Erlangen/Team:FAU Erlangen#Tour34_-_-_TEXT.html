“Science never solves a problem without creating ten more” - George Bernard Shaw
Sequences
We planned to work with three different loci, yet forgot to synthesize a selectionmarker within the sequence for the recombination.
Due to misunderstanding the only working homologous insert for the can1 gene was not used.
rpd3
the rpd3 clones sent for sequencing always contained mutations
Golden Gate
we ordered a wrong enzyme with a way too high temperature optimum --> reaction had very little production
accidentally digestion of our Golden Gate fragments over night with an enzyme with star activity
