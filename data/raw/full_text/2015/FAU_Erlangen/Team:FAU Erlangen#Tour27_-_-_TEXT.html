The end
We asked the brewery
As it turned out it would not be a good idea for many reasons, to use the yeast from a local brewery, or use our yeast for their beer.
Instead, we took some effort to figure out which strains are best to used. We planned to work with different loci as well as different strains to test under as many circumstances as possible. Sadly, due to time conflicts we were only able to test with the strain K699. All strains were kindly provided by the working group of Prof. Dr. Koch.
K699
We used this derivative of strain W303 as sole testing ground for our transformation and project.
Genotype: MATa, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3, 112, his3-11,15, ura3, GAL, psi+
4196
This strain is a derivate of the yeast strain BY4742, which carries an intact copy of the canamycin-gene which can be disrupted by homologous recombination. This was planned to be a second locus of interest next to trp. Genotype: BY4742; MATalpha; his3Î”1, leu2&Delta0, ura3&Delta0
