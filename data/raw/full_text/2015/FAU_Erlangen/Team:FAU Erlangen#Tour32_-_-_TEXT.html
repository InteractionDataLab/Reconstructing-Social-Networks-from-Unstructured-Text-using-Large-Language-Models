Results of the project
2015-09-10
Viewed ONCs with fluorescence microscope: 699 (negative control) shows strong fluorescence. Probably contaminated with YFP yeast. Plated on –Trp plate to test the assumption.
Picked 699 clone from fresh plate (M. Dahl) – clone shows no fluorescence.
Transferred ONCs to 50ml of the appropriate deficient SC medium. Also inoculated one clone from 699 plate (M. Dahl) in 50ml SC full medium. Additionally inoculated 699 strain in –Trp SC and –Ura –Leu –Trp SC to see if it survives. Incubation over night at 28°C and 180rpm
2015-09-11
RNA extraction from yeast overnight cultures using the RiboPure Yeast RNA isolation Kit. Handling according to manufacturer’s instructions. Executed by F. Winter and N. Übelmesser.
A sample was taken from 699 and YIYFP1 isolates before DNase treatment to test via PCR for YFP DNA.
All samples were tested with YFP PCR for residual gDNA. PCR over night.
2015-09-14
PCR samples were loaded on a gel. Bands appeared in all samples except the 699 sample.
Yeast plates from 09-09: Colonies on TALE1/YEplac181 plate, otherwise none.
Mixed RT reaction according to protocol.
50µl reactions for +RT and 25µl reactions for –RT control.
2015-09-15
Inoculated one colony of YIYFP1, 3 Rpd3/TALE constructs and 699 in SC medium at 30°C for 4 hours. Then the cultures were inspected via CLSM. All cultures show strong fluorescence. Most likely the SC medium is the cause.
Tested qPCR primers: eYFP primer efficiency: 95%, tub Primer efficiency: 85%
2015-09-16
Mixed qPCR Master mix (Promega goTaq qPCR Master Mix) for tomorrow. Test PCR of all RT reactions for YFP DNA. Bands in every sample except 699.
2015-09-17
Pipetted all qPCR reactions on 96 well plate. qPCR reaction was successful.
Inoculated yeast ONCs for CLSM tomorrow.
2015-09-18
Data analysis of qPCR with J. Schmidpeter. Rpd3/TALE transformed yeast strains exhibit strongly lowered levels of YFP mRNA.
One more qPCR to confirm primer efficiency. The result does not differ much from the last time.
CLSM: Transformed YIYFP strains appear to show less fluorescence.
