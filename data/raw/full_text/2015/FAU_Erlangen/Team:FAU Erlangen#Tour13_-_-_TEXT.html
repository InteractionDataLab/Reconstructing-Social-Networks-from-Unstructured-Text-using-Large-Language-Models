General Support
Professor Dr. Uwe Sonnewald turned out to be the first person to support our iGEM vision. Giving us our lab spaces and getting the Department of Biology behind our project was an enormous help to us. Regularly, he checks up on us to ask if everything is going all right. In addition, he helped us with lab materials and financially.
Lab support
Marlene Pr√∂schel, a PhD student in the Division of Biochemistry, introduced us to the different labs and surroundings. She was our go to person when it came to any questions, be it either theoretical or practical. Moreover, she lent us a hand in the lab on some occasions (e.g. rpd3 overlap PCR).
Thanks to the Division of Molecular Plant Physiology (MPP) for letting us use their confocal laser scanning microscope to analyse our YFP expressing yeast.
Project advisor support
Professor Dr. Christian Koch was our specialist when it came to yeast knowledge. While always staying interested as well as enthusiastic, he also provided us with more lab space and materials. Prof. Koch's never ending expertise gave us great insight to homologous recombination, promotors, plasmids and literature.
Wiki page layout support
This Wiki Page layout was in large parts copied from the 2014 Team from SDU Denmark , which itself is also based on the 2013 Team from denmark under the CC license . There have been several styling adjustments to make it optically distinguishable from their wiki, but the core concept remains the same. Initially, we planned to make our own layout, but since no one in our team has ever done any webpage developing, we had to adapt and only make small changes to an already existing layout.
Team logo design
We are the first team of FAU Erlangen to participate in iGEM, so we didn't have a logo yet. Hence Andreas Feser from team Marburg offered us to design our logo and he did a great job!

Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Thanks to everybody working in the Division of Biochemistry for giving us a lab, for accepting our presence and answering all our "stupid" questions.

Want more? Go to iGEM.org!
If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
