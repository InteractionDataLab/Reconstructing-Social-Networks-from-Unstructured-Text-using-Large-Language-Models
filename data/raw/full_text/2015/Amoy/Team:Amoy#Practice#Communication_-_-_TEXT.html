COMMUNICATION
Communication is an important part in this competition. Teams can benefit a lot from others. This year, our communications via net-video and face-to-face meeting establish a deep friendship with counterparts.
Ⅰ. Net-video Meeting
We skyped with the following iGEM teams: NCTU_Formosa, NJU_CHINA, Pasteur_Paris and SYSU_CHINA. It is really a good chance to share ideas with each other. During the net-video meetings, we learned a lot from our counterparts: NJU_CHINA is the first team to have an online meeting with us. We exchanged some ideas on April 4th and their team leader somehow inspired us the topic of the first Newsletter, mentioning the "Help Another Team" part. They benefited a lot from their project in 2013 iGEM, which enlightened us about the continuity of our project. Our second online meeting was with SYSU_CHINA on April 11th. We shared our outline about our project. At the same time, we found that they had also got a clear direction. On April 30th, we skyped with our French friends from Pasteur_Paris. They showed great interest in Newsletter and they finally did the part about "Interviews on scientists relevant to bioscience". We met NCTU_Formosa online on May 13th. We’ve learned a lot from the differences of the manner of working and the way of thinking.

Ⅱ. Face-to-face Meeting
We also had face-to-face meetings with leaders of both teams from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU-Software and SYSU_CHINA). It is really a rare opportunity to talk with both wet team and software team. We were illuminated a great deal from their methods of management.

Ⅲ. iGEM HQ to SUSTC
One of our instructors, Associate Prof. Wu Lina together with one of our advisors, Doctor Huang Jianxing went to Shenzhen in May when delegates from iGEM Headquarters came to China. They communicated about the current situation about the iGEM Competition and synthetic biology. Our Newsletter drew some inspirations after they attended the meeting.
