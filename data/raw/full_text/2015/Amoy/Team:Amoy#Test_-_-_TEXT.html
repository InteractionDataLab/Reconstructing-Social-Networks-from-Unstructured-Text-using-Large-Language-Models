ABSTRACT
L-tert-leucine (L-Tle) is an important and attractive chiral building block, which can be used to produce protease inhibitors of HIV, HCV and so on. Scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to produce L-Tle by using leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) with cofactor-NADH. It greatly improved the yield and optical purity of L-Tle. However, owing to different activities of LeuDH and FDH, the NADH consumption would be faster than its regeneration. Therefore, addition of excess NADH is necessary. Many methods have been used, but none made a difference. Our project devised a method that regulating the activity of LeuDH by changing RBS of leudh. And fdh and leudh were borne in a plasmid. This idea controls copy numbers and transformation efficiency, and the only variable is RBS's efficiency of leudh. With the different efficiency of RBSs, we can get different activity of LeuDH. And from the experimental results, we can get the suitable RBS's efficiency and the best catalytic efficiency. Finally, the disire L-Tle was obtained with >99% conversion and a high enantioselectivity of >99% ee value.
