CONTRIBUTION
Our team called for papers once the new topic occurred to us. After collecting articles, we did the layout and then distributed new issues to all teams we had managed to get in touch with as soon as possible. With the help of Paris_Bettencourt and Pasteur_Paris , Newsletter was spread all over the world. In spite of Meetups, we have Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and QQ to keep in touch with other teams in no time. Thanks to their generous help, we successfully publish our Newsletters to the public. Meanwhile, we send Newsletters as attachments to both writers and readers who we’ve contacted. In particular, we are grateful to Stockholm for offering the platform called issuu.com , which made it easier to show our issues. We really appreciated it that Professor Wayne Materi attached us a permitted version of his article named ‘Leading a Successful iGEM Team’ when we began the first issue. 'I am happy that students still consider this article useful. It is a few years old now and I haven’t been involved in iGEM for several years. I’m surprised it’s still relevant.' We’ve managed to get in touch with 76 teams who were interested in Newsletter and finally the following 52 teams from 33 countries joined us.
