TALK
On September 11th, Prof. Lin Zhanglin from Tsinghua University gave the professors and students of College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering an impressive lecture about the research progress and prospect of synthetic biology. Professor Lin Zhanglin is one of the lead scientists of 973 Project. Design and application of synthetic biology parts is part of his research directions. His research papers are mainly published in Nature, PNAS, JBC, Biotechniques, JB and Methods in Molecular Biology.

In the lecture, Professor LIN introduced the history of synthetic biology and stated his expectation. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field of study. Professors from different subjects had a heated debate about the topic. Prof. Huang Rongbin exchanged his opinion on how to define synthesis biology. Then Associate Prof. Wu Lina proposed a discussion on the difference between the synthesis biology and the metabolic engineering. The dialogues between the professors also gave us many beneficial inspirations.

Prof. Lin had a symposium with 2015 Amoy iGEMers after the lecture. First, the representatives of the 2015 Amoy iGEMers gave a presentation on the project this year. We gave a brief introduction of our experiments and human practices. Prof. Lin listened carefully and gave many beneficial suggestions, such as how to make the expression more authentic and professional, how to leave judges an impression on your project and how to improve our project. Everyone learned a lot through the conversation. Then we asked Prof. Lin about the future of the synthesis biology in China. The Chinese scientists have many achievements in synthesis biology till now, but we still have a long way to go. Whatever, we all believed that synthesis biology will improve human life and enhance the human welfare.
