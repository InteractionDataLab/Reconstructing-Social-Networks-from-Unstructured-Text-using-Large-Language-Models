NOTEBOOK
Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for the reason that enzymes are  always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost of L-tert-leucine production. So scientists introduced whole-cell biocatalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of cofactor NADH. In the path of building our biobricks, we divided the circuits into two modules. One is promoter linked with RBS and the other is gene linked with terminator. The dendrogram below is our experiments detail. Click each bottom for more information.
