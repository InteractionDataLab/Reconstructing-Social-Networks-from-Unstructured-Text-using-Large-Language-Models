PROMOTION
As one of the most beautiful campuses in China, Xiamen University has its natural advantages that it attracts tourists from all over the world. Thus it is much easier for us to spread synthetic biology to people from all walks of life.
Figure 1 Promote Synthetic Biology to Tourists
At the same time, we managed to convey knowledge relevant to synthetic biology and iGEM to college freshmen during and after their registration. To make it specific, we designed exquisite brochures and handed them out, answering questions with all our forces.

After doing a short survey, we drew a conclusion that students in upper classes and the same year found it necessary to lecture newcomers. They argued that it is an effective way of communication between seniors and freshmen. Thus we finally held a Teach-in in the Lecture Hall of College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering on Aug. 29th. It is really delighted to see that many freshmen showed their great interest in iGEM competition and synthetic biology. Some students aired their opinions on GMOs like GMF (Genetically Modified Food). A steady influx of freshmen joined our QQ group after the promotion. Hope their interests in synthetic biology last long.
