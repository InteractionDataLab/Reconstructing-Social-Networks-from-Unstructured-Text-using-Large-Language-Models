We are grateful to Prof. Baishan Fang, Prof. Chaoyong Yang, Prof. Dai Wang, Prof. Xiaomei Yan and A. P. Lina Wu for their suggestion and support on our idea and lab work.
For some unknown reason, our BBa_B0030, BBa_B0031, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0033 and BBa_B0034 do not give a good performance. NJU-China sent us their copy and they worked well. Thanks for their help.
Our project got advice from captain of SYSU-CHINA , Dengwen Lai, and his suggestions enlighten us to think our project from a different view.
