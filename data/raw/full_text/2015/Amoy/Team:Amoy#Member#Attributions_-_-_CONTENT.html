We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</P><P>
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</P><H5> What should this page have?</H5><UL><LI>General Support</LI><LI>Project support and advice</LI><LI>Fundraising help and advice</LI><LI>Lab support</LI><LI>Difficult technique support</LI><LI>Project advisor support</LI><LI>Wiki support</LI><LI>Presentation coaching</LI><LI>Human Practices support</LI><LI> Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team</LI></UL><H4>Inspiration</H4><P>Take a look at what other teams have done:</P><UL><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Team">2011 Imperial College London</A> (scroll to the bottom)</LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Attributions">2014 Exeter </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Melbourne/Attributions">2014 Melbourne </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Attributions">2014 Valencia Biocampus</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
