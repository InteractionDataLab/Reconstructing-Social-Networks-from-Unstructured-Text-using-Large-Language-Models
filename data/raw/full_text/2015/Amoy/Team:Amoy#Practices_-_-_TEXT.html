OVERVIEW
Amoy has done a lot of work about Human Practices this year. The most special part is Newsletter and we list it out as a module in the navigation menu. Apart from Newsletter, we tried our best to promote synthetic biology and iGEM to the public, especially to the freshmen during and after their registration. We also talked with Prof. Lin Zhanglin from Tsinghua University about the current situation of synthetic biology.
