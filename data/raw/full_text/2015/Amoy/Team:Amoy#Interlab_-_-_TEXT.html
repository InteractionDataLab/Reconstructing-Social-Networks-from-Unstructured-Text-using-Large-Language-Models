Ⅰ. Introduction
The goal of the Interlab study is to obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP from iGEM teams around the world. This year, three devices were cloned by ourselves, and one positive control and one negative control were provided by the registry. Using a plate reader, fluorescence measurements were obtained in arbitrary units. The results show increased fluorescence in the stronger promoter expected. After the experiment, three required devices were created: J23101+I13504 in the pSB3C3 backbone. J23106+I13504 in the pSB1C3 backbone. J23117+I13504 in the pSB1C3 backbone. Devices constructed in pSB1C3 are high copy number plasmids, hence a strong fluorescence can be obviously observed by naked eyes. While for device J23117 + I13504, the promoter strength is the weakest, we could barely observe any fluorescence under natural light.

1. Digestion Verification
Four devices (J23101+I13504/J23106+I13504/J23117+I13504/I20270) are double digested at EcoR I and Pst I restriction sites to verify the target parts. The restriction map is shown as Figure 3. As expected, the second bands are supposed to be aroud 1000bp, which is consistent with what we saw on the map.

2. DNA sequencing
All created parts are verified by DNA sequencing, analyzed by DNAMAN software, as following:

Ⅱ. Protocol
1. Transform constructed plasmids into DH5α competent cells, grown in incubator for 12 hrs at 37℃. 2. Add 5 mL LB medium with antibiotic (Chloramphenicol 35 μg/mL) into test tubes, choose monoclonal cells from the petri dish. 3. Set up 3 biological replicates of each device. Cultures were grown in test tubes for 16 hours at 37℃, shaking at 200 rpm. 4. Obtain initial OD 600 measurement of overnight cultures. Then dilute each sample to an OD of 0.5 (margin of error: 5%). 5. Set instrument to measure GFP. 6. Measurements of absorbance and fluorescence: (1) OD 600 Device: Spectrophotometer Wavelengths: 600 nm absorption. (2) Fluorescence Device: FLUOstar omega microplate reader, 96-well plates. Wavelengths: 485 nm excitation, 520 nm emission.
Ⅲ. Measurements
Absorbance at 600 nm was measured for each of the three cultures, alongside controls for media and contamination background. The dilution required for each sample has been calculated. Table 1 presents the re-measurement of samples on OD 600, and all OD 600 are within 5% of 0.5 (0.475-0.525).

D1-D3 wells=Negative control device (only promoter). E1-E3 wells=Positive control device (I20270 in PSB1C3 backbone); F wells=LB media plus antibiotic (chloramphenicol only). G wells=non-inoculate cultures Three technical replicates (horizontal), three biological replicates(vertical) for A, B, C, and D. 485 ex/520 em; Units are arbitrary.
Data was processed as follows: 1. Background absorbance was removed by subtracting the value of F wells. 2. Background fluorescence was controlled for by subtracting the value of F wells. 3. Calculate the mean value and standard deviation of the 3 biological replicates and 3 technical replicates. 4. Evaluate the variability of chosen analysis technique.
