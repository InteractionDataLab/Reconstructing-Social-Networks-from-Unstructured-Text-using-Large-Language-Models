One of our goals this year, was to include some BioBricks into our flexosome, therefore optimising or combining their functions. As a starting point we decided to use the colourful reporters that Uppsala made in 2011.
We used their BioBricks amilCP , eforRed and cjBlue and fused these to different dockerin domains, which would bind to our construct. In the end, we managed to combine the new BioBrick for BCEL_Dockerin and eforRed from the Uppsala Team, to create a Biobrick ( BBa_K1865001 ), which can be used in conjunction with our flexosome.
