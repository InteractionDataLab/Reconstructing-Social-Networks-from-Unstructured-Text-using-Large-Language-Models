Hi world! Stefani Diaz here.
Directly from Costa Rica I’m now in Germany collecting new experiences, the latest one: being part of the iGEM team Gottingen 2015!
As a biotechnologist with a big background in mass communication, I believe that social communication of science, or scientific outreach, is a must in our modern society; everybody should have the chance to know how amazing our word is!  iGEM represents for me an opportunity to bring science out of the traditional academic world, to unleash our team creativity and have some scientific fun.<B>Interesting fact:</B>
Painting and reading are also among my passions. And chocolate, especially chocolate, call me a “chocoholic” ;) .
vities.

It’s me Nida Amin from Pakistan, I am member of the IGEM team 2015 and responsible for the wet lab work. I had completed my Bachelors in Zoology last year from University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. My goodluck started last year when I was selected on EXPERTS III scholarship as Master’s exchange student from Pakistan to study in Microbiology and Biochemistry program of Georg-August- Universität, Göttingen, Germany. The combination of my Bachelor’s degree with this current Master’s program and especially membership of this team, provides me the platform to excel in my desired area and achieve my goals of becoming a little scientist in future. It was my wish to enhance my own knowledge and to do research work in a competitive environment where I will effectively utilizes my analytical, interpersonal skills to reach the pinnacle of success and with the passage of time every wish is coming true.<B>Interesting fact:</B>
I feel very lucky because from my school life to uptill now my parents don’t have to pay for my studies because Its my record to be on scholarship for each degree due to my hardwork.

Hey, my name is Alexander Lohmeyer. Within the iGEM project I’m member of the website team. My study in business informatics started just last year, so I am still at the beginning of my studies. But I am really excited to join a fascinating project such as iGEM. My job in this team is to develop the website, manage it and do whatever I can do to support the iGEM Team Göttingen.</P><P><B>Interesting fact:</B>
In my free time, I like to run and go to the volunteer fire brigade. Unfortunately I had to leave the fire brigade, when I moved to Göttingen. But in the future, I want to rejoin.

My name is Alaa Shaikhqasem, a member of iGEM team Göttingen 2015. I earned my bachelor degree in biology from Birzeit University, Palestine in 2012. In 2014 I joined the master program of Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen.  I gained a strong interest in scientific topics, especially those concerning the field of biology. Since I started studying biology, I was fascinated by the complexity and diversity of the living systems, and was impressed by the various possibilities which the study of these systems can offer. The reason I joined iGEM is to strengthen my research skills, to gain experience, and to be creative in science, and I find the topic of our project quite interesting.</P><P><B>Interesting fact:</B>
In my free time I usually watch movies. I like gardening and cooking, and I consider the kitchen my second lab. I also like learning languages and someday I’ll create my own German word.

My name is Dennis Twesmann, I am from Germany and currently participating in the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” at the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in molecular biosciences there, too. During my bachelor thesis in the department of molecular structural biochemistry, I established a purification protocol for the spliceosomal DEAD box RNA helicase Prp28 from the thermophilic eukaryote Chaetomium thermophilum in order to investigate its structure by means of X-ray crystallography. The work in this field reflects my general interest in understanding the functions of enzymes on a molecular level as well as the underlying biological chemistry, done by these greatest chemists on earth. That is one of the reasons I joined the iGEM team 2015 pursuing a project where distinct enzymatic activities, brought together in a “Flexosome”, play a major role. So far, I inter alia helped to develop the booklet of our project in order to find sponsors and I am currently within the long-winded process of solving the practical implementation of our project in the lab.

Hi there, my name is Julian Schwanbeck. Originally from Hamburg, I obtained my bachelor’s degree here in the Georg-August Universität Göttingen in the field of Microbiology, mainly by failing to find a new trans-membrane transporter in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. I am also with the organisation committee. iGEM interested me mostly, as planning, organising and undertaking an own research project is something an ordinary masters student usually doesn’t get to experience. I am mostly interested in learning new methods as well as planning the experimental setup efficiently. During the weekends, I like to play with our dog in Hamburg.</P><P><B>Interesting fact:</B> I enjoy writing lab journal entries and repairing keyboards more than writing a short passage about myself.
