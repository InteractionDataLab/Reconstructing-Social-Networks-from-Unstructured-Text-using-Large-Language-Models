B: Substrate for cellulase screening
In 15 ml falcon tube, the substrate with final concentration 1% (w/v) is prepared in 96% (v/v) ethanol. For-example, to prepare 10 ml stock solution, weight 0.1 g of AZCL-HE-Cellulose and transfer it to 15 ml falcon tube, then add 96% (v/v) ethanol until the volume reached 10 ml.
The stock solution will be stored at +4 °C.
C: Prepare the agar plates
When the medium cools down to around 60 °C, put the bottle containing LB-agar base on a magnetic mixer. At the same time, disperse the substrate by flip the falcon tube several times. Then, pour the substrate into the LB-agar base gently until the substrate suspend evenly in the agar medium (For how much substrate should be poured, ask the supervisor). Other reagents like antibiotic can also be added. Ca. 3-5 ml substrate per Liter medium.
D: Preparation of agar plates contacting cellulose substrate
After dispersing substrate and adding antibiotic to LB-agar , pour the medium quickly with continuous stirring onto the plates and make sure to make a thin layer of medium. Let the plates to dry and store them at 4 °C.
 
E: Another method of pouring Substrate for cellulase screening on to the agar plates
Rather than using normal pouring method one can first prepare regular LB plates having  just a thin layer of LB. After preparation of substrate for cellulase screening add the proper antibiotic to it and then pour this mixture on top of this thin LB layer with constant stirring. Let the plates to dry and then store at 4 °C.

Cloning principle:
pJET1.2 is a linearized cloning vector designed for inserts from 6 bp to 10 kb. The 5’-ends of the vector contain phosporyl groups, therefore phosphorylation of the PCR products is indicated.
Optimal insert/vector ratio is 3:1. (0.15 pmol ends of insert and 0.05 pmol ends of vector)
Optimal PCR product quantity for ligation reaction is to be calculated from the Kit protocol, For the length of 2.5 kb of PCR product, to have 0.15 pmol ends of the PCR product in the ligation reaction 125 ng of the PCR product should be used.
For PCR products more than 3 kb, ligation can be prolonged to 30 min.

Transformation Efficiency Kit, RFP construct (iGEM)
Before using our competent E. coli TOP10 cells in the important experiments, we used the Transformation Efficiency Kit to test the efficiency of our competent cells!
The kit includes five vials of each different DNA concentration: 50pg/μl, 20pg/μl, 10pg/μl, 5pg/μl, 0.5pg/μl of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3.
 
Protocol as distributed by iGEM (modified)
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8000-10000 rpm will be sufficient. Note: There should be 50 µL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Label one 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube for each concentration and then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each microcentrifuge tube. For each concentration, use a separate tube.
Pipet 50 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes. Pre-heat heating block now to 42°C.
Heat-shock the cells by placing onto the heating block for 1 minute.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes. This helps the cells recover.
Add 200 µL of LB media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour. Prepare the LB-Cam (Chloramphenicol) agar plates during this time: label them.
Pipet 20 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Do triplicates (3 each) of each tube if possible, so you can calculate an average colony yield. Incubate at 37°C overnight. Position the plates so the agar side is facing up, and the lid is facing down.
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.
(colonies on plate) / ng of DNA plated x 1,000ng/µg
Note: The measurement "ng of DNA plated" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation:
1 µL x concentration of DNA (refer to vial) x (volume plated / total reaction volume)
 
NOTE: Since this protocol led to a very low transformation efficiency we repeated the experiment with 200 µL competent cells instead of 50 µL and plated 100 µL instead of 20 µL.
 
Results
Competent cells should have an efficiency of 1.5x108 to 6x108 cfu/µg DNA, where "cfu" means "colony-forming unit" and is a measurement of cells.
Protein Extraction and Purification
Induction, harvest and disruption of expression cultures
Induction
Recombinant protein expression was exclusively realized in E.coli. pET101-ScaA was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells under the control of the lac operon, and pBAD-RFP-ACEL (and all other pBAD constructs) was expressed in TOP 10 cells under the control of the ara operon. The     procedure is as follows:
Inoculate “fat” LB expression medium, having a volume corresponding to 5 % of the shake flask that is used, with 5 % (v/v) of an overnight LB starter     culture grown at 37°C and 150 rpm.
Incubate the expression culture at 37°C and 150 rpm until an OD600 between 2.5 and 3.5 is reached.
Induce protein expression by adding the appropriate inducer to the expression culture. In case of pET101-ScaA use 1 mM IPTG and in case of pBAD-RFP-ACEL     use 0.2 % (v/v) L-arabinose.
Incubate the expression culture for 20 h at 37°C and 150 rpm.
Take a 1 ml sample before induction and before cell harvesting in order to analyze the expression effectivity of target proteins by SDS-PAGE.
Cell Harvest
Pellet the culture at 4°C, 13000rpm for 20min (SLA-3000 rotor, Sorvall).
Resuspend and wash with an equal volume of LEW Buffer (see Protein extraction).
Repeat previous centrifugation step.

Affinity chromatography of His-tagged proteins
The N-terminal His6- tagged fusion proteins His6-ScaA and His6-RFP-ACEL were purified by nickel affinity chromatography     using Ni-NTA-agarose columns in a first purification step.
Preparation:
Connect a 5 ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) to an Äkta purifier or Äkta prime system and wash the column with 1 CV (column volume) 20 % EtOH and a     maximum flow rate of 3 ml/min.
Pre-equilibrate the column with lysis buffer by first washing 3 CV with water, followed by 3 CV with buffer, each with a maximum flow rate of 5 ml/min.
Run:
1.) Load the protein solution onto the column using an appropriate super loop (10 ml or 50 ml) and a maximum flow rate of 1 ml/min. Start the automated     fractionation system.
2.) Once the protein is loaded, wash the column with lysis buffer using a maximum flow rate of 5 ml/min until the UV absorption has reached a constant     value.
3.) Start eluting unspecifically bound, contaminative protein species with a flow rate of 3 ml/min by applying a stepwise gradient from 0 % to 2 % of     elution buffer.
4.) Elute the target protein with a flow rate of 3 ml/min by applying a linear gradient from 2 % to 50 % of elution buffer over 20 CV (column volumes).
5.) Analyze obtained peak fractions by SDS-PAGE and pool the fractions containing the target protein.
6.) Reduce the volume of the protein solution via concentration until a maximum volume of 5 ml is reached and apply it to size exclusion chromatography.
All chromatographical purification steps are carried out at 20°C.
Required buffers
Buffer A: Lysis buffer (20 mM phosphate pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)
Buffer B: Elution buffer (Lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole)
Size Exclusion Chromatography
In a second purification step, the target proteins ScaA and RFP-ACEL were separated according to their size (radius of gyration) by employing size     exclusion chromatography. Therefore:
Connect a HiLoad Superdex 200 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) to an Äkta purifier or Äkta prime system and wash the column with 1 CV of 20 % EtOH and a     maximum flow rate of 1 ml/min.
Pre-equilibrate the column with loading buffer by washing first with 1 CV of water and subsequently with 1 CV of the respective buffer, each with a maximum     flow rate of 1 ml/min.
Load the concentrated protein solution with a maximum flow rate of 1 ml/min onto the column by using a 5 ml sampling loop. Start the automated     fractionation.
Elute the target protein with a maximum flow rate of 1 ml/min and analyze obtained peak fractions on a SDS gel.
Pool the fractions containing the target protein.
All chromatographic purification steps are carried out at room temperature.
Required buffer:
Buffer A: Loading buffer (20 mM phosphate pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)
Concentration of protein solutions
Concentration of protein solutions was realized via centrifugation using 20 ml Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Viva Science) with the appropriate     molecular weight cutoffs of 50 kDa in case of the scaffolding protein ScaA and 30 kDa in case of RFP-ACEL. In order to concentrate protein solutions:
Wash the concentrator with 20 ml of buffer in order to remove the protectant (glycerol) from the membrane.
Add the protein sample to the concentrator and start centrifugation at 4°C until the desired volume/concentration is reached. The sample volume and the     speed is determined by the rotor that is used. If a 25° fixed angle rotor is applied, the maximum starting volume is 14 ml and the speed is restricted to     6000 x g.
Gently mix the upper reservoir prior to each refilling step and prior to transfer.
Check the flow through for leakage by Bradford assay.
Bradford Assay
Bradford Assay
For calculating protein concentrations of an unknown sample the traditional way is to use a standard curve that is generated from known protein standards. Readily available protein standards contain bovine serum albumin (BSA) or bovine gamma globulin (γ-globulin, IgG). The calculated result is an estimation of protein concentration since Bradford protein assays do show significant protein-to-protein variation.
For our Bradford assay we got an already prepared standard solution with a factor of 15.924.
Caution: Store the Bradford solution in the dark, it is light sensitive.
 
Sample preparation:
Measurement takes place against 20 μL water (blank).
Blank: 20 μL + 1 mL Bradford solution
Samples: 1-20 μL (depending on protein concentration, max. 2 mg/mL) + 19-0 μL water + 1 mL Bradford solution
Prepare photometer cuvettes for technical triplicates of all samples + one blank
Preheat photometer light and set it to 595 nm
Pipet the samples (plus water) and the blank into the cuvettes
Pipet 1 mL Bradford solution on top, carefully homogenize by pipetting up and down
Avoid air bubbles
Incubate the cuvettes in the dark for 5 minutes
Immediately measure the samples at 595 nm

SDS Polyacrylamid Gel Electrophoresis
The analytic protein separation according to the apparent molecular weight was carried out by discontinuous SDS polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis according     to Laemmli (1970) using mini gel electrophoresis chambers (BioRad, 10x8 cm). For cast and run of the gels do the following:
For the stacking gel use the following components: 0.25 % of the total volume of stacking gel buffer, and acrylamid to a final concentration of 4 %. Add     water to the final volume (cf. pipetting scheme). Add 1/133 of the total volume of 10 % ammonium persulfate (APS) and 1/1000 of     N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyl-ethylenediamine (TEMED).
For the separation gel mix the appropriate amount of acrylamid (e.g. 10 % for a 10 % SDS gel) with 0.25 % of the final volume of separation gel buffer and     fill with water to the final volume. Add 1/133 of the total volume of 10 % APS and 1/1000 of TEMED.
Place the poured gel into the running chamber and fill the upper and lower reservoir with running buffer.
Dilute the protein samples 1:1 with loading buffer and load the gel.
Run the gel with 15mA per gel for 15 min, and then increase to 30mA per Gel until the end.
After electrophoretic separation, place the gels into staining solution and heat it without boiling.
Incubate the gels under slow agitation until protein bands become visible.
Discolor the gels by using fixation solution.

* The optimal annealing temperature for Phusion DNA Polymerase may differ significantly from that of Taq-based polymerases. Always use the Tm calculator and instructions on our website (www.thermoscientific.com/pcrwebtools) to determine the Tm values of primers and optimal annealing temperature. The Phusion DNA Polymerase has the ability to stabilize primer-template hybridization. As a basic rule, for primers > 20 nt, anneal for 10–30 seconds at a Tm +3°C of the lower Tm primer. For primers ≤ 20 nt, use an annealing temperature equal to the Tm of the lower Tm primer.

RFP microscopy
To check if the transformed E.coli TOP10 show red fluorescence, the culture was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The RFP DsRed filter was used (excitation at 536 nm, emission at 582 nm). To prevent the cells from floating around they are fixed in 0.8%.
 
Preparation of slides
Prepare 0.8% agarose with water and boil it up.
Pipet 500 μL onto a slide and press another one on top. Let the agarose cure between both slides.
Carefully remove the upper slide and put the sample name in one corner the one with the agarose.
Dilute the desired cell cultures 1:10 up to 1:50 (depends on thickness) and remember to prepare also a positive (if available) and negative control.
Pipet 10-20 μL of the diluted culture on the agarose and put the cover slip on top.
Perform fluorescence microscopy with the right filter.
If successful, take pictures of the red fluorescing E. coli.
Note: Agarose has a slight self-fluorescence.
