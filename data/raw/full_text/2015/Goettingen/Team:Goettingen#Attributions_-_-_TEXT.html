Prof. Dr. Rolf Daniel
Hosted our iGEM Team in his lab for "Genomic and Applied Microbiology" and gave us access to all resources and advice we needed.
Dr. Silja Brady
Came up with the idea for the project and laid the foundation for us to work on. She guided us through the first months before she had to leave due to changes in her employment. Together with some of the team members she designed the synthetic scaffoldin and developed the cloning strategy.
Dr. Elzbieta Brzuszkiewicz
Worked alongside Silja to develop the project idea and give us a starting basis. Elzbieta left  us after 6 months due to the birth of her son.
Both Elzbieta and Silja helped with the design of our two synthetic scaffoldins and taught us the cloning strategy and programmes for the evaluation of our sequences, such as Clone Manager.
Dr. Heiko Liesegang
Heiko took over the supervision of our project, after Silja and Elzbieta had left us. He supported us with advice and troubleshooting during the final months, as well as making sure that things were running smoothly. Heiko supervised the design and practice of our Poster and presentation for the Giant Jamboree.
Mechthild Bömeke
The TA of the Genomic and Applied Microbiology Lab helped us greatly during the last couple of months. She patiently taught us many new techniques and helped us find all the supplies we needed, as well as aiding in emergency trouble shooting.
Dr. Robert Hertel, Genis Andres Castillo Villamizar, Amélie Dukunde and Dr. Bernd Wemheuer
Supported us with wet lab related techniques, trouble shooting and development of our project once our initial supervisors had left. They all gave input and feedback from their respective areas in order to aid our team.
Jacqueline Hollensteiner
Provided us with RFP strains and information about them.
Daniela Dreykluft
As the secretary, she handled the accounts and administration and kept an overview of our finances.
All of the people mentioned above greatly helped to bring the project as far as it is now. The project we are submitting is very much a joint effort, not only of the iGEM Team itself, but also of the hosting lab. We are very thankful for all the time they have contributed to the project. Not only did they give us feedback but they also taught us a great deal, ranging from techniques to project management.
In addition to the people directly involved with the project, we would also like to thank our Sponsors who supported us financially or materially and anyone else who supported us and offered their help.
Experimental Contributions
Sequencing of all samples was either done by the G2L lab or overnight at Seqlab.
Both Scaffoldins were synthesised by Life Technologies GmbH after having been designed by the supervisors and the team.
Primers were synthesized by EllaBiotech and Sigma.
