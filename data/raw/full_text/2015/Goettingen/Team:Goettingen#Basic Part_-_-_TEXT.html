Basic Parts
One of the main components in our flexosome are the dockerins. Therefore, we submitted a dockerin derived from Bacteroides cellulolyticus to the Registry BBa_K1865000 . This part can be combined with a protein of choice and linked to a scaffoldin with a matching cohesin domain from B. cellulolyticus . For further information refer to the registry entry and our results section.
