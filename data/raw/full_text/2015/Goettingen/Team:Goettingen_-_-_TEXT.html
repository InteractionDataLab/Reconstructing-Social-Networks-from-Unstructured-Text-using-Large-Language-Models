Welcome to our Wiki!
Welcome to the Wiki of Team Göttingen 2015!
This year's team has come together to develop the Flexosome. The flexosome is designed to be a multienzymatic complex, which can combine your enzymatic pathway of choice in one construct, or alternatively be used as a multipurpose tool.
We are the iGEM Team Göttingen 2015 - 11 motivated and ambitious students from the Georg-August-University of Göttingen in Germany. 10 master students of the program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” and 1 bachelor student of the program “Business Informatics” share the spirit of iGEM to develop novel, creative and inspiring ideas for the use of genetically engineered systems to solve scientific and social problems.
After the successful participation of teams from the Georg-August-University of Göttingen in the iGEM-competition 2012, 2013 and 2014, the iGEM Team 2015 will represent again a new collegiate research project. We love experimental work, hunt for answers and are supporting each other invariably in order to fulfill our objectives! Check out our website for more information on the team, our project, collaborations and creative aspects around iGEM. Our team is supported by Prof. Dr. Daniel, Dr. Silja Brady, Dr. Elzbieta Brzuszkiewicz and Dr. Heiko Liesegang from the Department of Genomic and Applied Microbiology at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics. They not only give advises on the research of our topic, but also support us in how to organize the human project and raise funds. Let's start a fascinating trip towards the final Giant Jamboree in Boston!
