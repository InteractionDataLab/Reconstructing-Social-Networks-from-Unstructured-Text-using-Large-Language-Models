K1602022 - B0034-HistidinTag-Green fluorescent protein (B0034-His-GFP)
K1602021 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into B0034-pSB1A2. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. Colonies were screened by colony PCR with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR. Plasmids of positive clones were extracted. The construct was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into pSB1C3. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. Colonies were screened by colony PCR with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR.
