K1602011 - 2-Keto-3-Deoxygluconate Aldolase (yagE)
Figure 1 PCR of yagE. The size of the amplified product was around 1,1 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder (NEB).
The yagE gene was isolated from E. coli and amplified by colony PCR using the oligonucleotides yagE (FW) and yagE (REV). The PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with DpnI for 120 minutes and subsequently purified. The yagE amplicon was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into a pSB1C3 vector using T4-ligase. E. coli Top 10 were transformed with the ligation product by heat shock transformation and cells were spread out on a CMP agar plate. Clones were screened with colony PCR using VF2 and VR oligonucleotides. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones and verified by sanger sequencing.
