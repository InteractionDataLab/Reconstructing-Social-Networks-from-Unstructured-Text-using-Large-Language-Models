The decarboxylic activity of cadA was shown via a pH indicator assay. As a byproduct of the catalytic conversion of cis-aconitate to itaconic acid carbon dioxide is released into the assay mixture. Here it forms carbonic acid and thereby lowers the pH value of the mixture. This is visualized through the indicator bromothymol blue (BTB) which changes its configuration state depending on the surrounding pH-Value (pH 6.0 - 7.6). That change of configuration can be shown via a photometric analysis in a TECAN® Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader. The resulting data sheets are then put into a plotting script written in R and exported as a ggplot.

The assay was performed as following:
First Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB> was adjusted to a pH of 7.0 to function as a buffer. The final concentration of Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB> was 5mM. The assay system contained 10% (v/v) indicator stock (BTB) and 20 ul were added per well. As a negative control a purified TES protein fraction from disrupted BL21 cells was used. In a range from 0mM to 1mM (0,2mM steps; total of 6 reactions) cis-aconitate (substrate), dissolved in Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>-buffer solution was added per well to enable the enzymatic conversion. To put the turnover into relation with the maximum turnover we added extra rows that contained equal amounts of substrate and product (itaconic acid). Finally a row containing just itaconic acid was put at the bottom to be able to use the resulting values as a blank for the assay. All samples were prepared on ice.

One could be that the bubbles that formed in the wells when adding the chemicals could interfere with the light. Also the different substances were added on ice so when the plate was put in the heated reader water in the air might have condensated at the bottom of the wells and hinder the light beam. The resulting vibrations of shutting doors too harshly might also interfere with the plate moving mechanism inside the reader and cause malfunctioning.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="HPLC">HPLC</SPAN></H3><P>MS Itaconic acid

The change in absorption was measured using a TECAN® Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader. The resulting plots were created in Excel and are shown below. 
The enzymes were purified via TES 
The assay was performed as following:
100mM Tris/HCl buffer was adjusted to a pH of 8.2. Substrates for the reaction were a 5mM solution of NAD Na salt in the aforementioned buffer and a 10mM solution of d-xylose in the same buffer. 
Controls were made with only buffer (200µl), buffer and xylose (190µl buffer, 10µl d-xylose), buffer and NAD+(195µl buffer, 5µl NAD+ solution), buffer and enzyme (190µl buffer, 10µl NAD+) and buffer, enzyme and xylose(180µl buffer, 10µl d-xylose solution and 10µl enzyme).
The assay was run over 300 cycles, with measurements every 30 seconds at a constant temperature of 30°C.
