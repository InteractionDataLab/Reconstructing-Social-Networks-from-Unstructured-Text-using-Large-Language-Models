-Xylonolactonase (B0034-xylC)
Figure 1 Gel of B0034-xylC. The size of the amplified product was around 1 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder (NEB).
The BBa_B0034 ribosomal binding site was added upstream of the xylC -gene by cloning the gene in the pSB1A2-vector containing the RBS.
The pSB1A2‑vector was digested using SpeI and PstI and later dephosphorylated. The gene was digested using XbaI and SpeI and ligated in the vector with T4‑ligase. After transformation of E. coli Top 10 the resulting colonies were screened for positive clones by performing colony PCRs with VF2 and VR oligonucleotides. The plasmids of positive clones were purified and the inserts verified by sanger-sequencing. Afterwards the pSB1A2‑vector was replaced by the pSB1C3 vector using EcoRI and SpeI. The dephosphorylation and ligation were performed.
