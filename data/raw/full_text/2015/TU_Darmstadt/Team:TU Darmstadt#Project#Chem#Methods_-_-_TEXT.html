Thermal polyesterification of itaconic acid (IA), polyethylene glycol 400
 
Polymers were prepared in dependence on the experimental procedures of Barrett et al.[1]
The procedure requires exact masses. Therefore an analytical balance (4 decimal places) was used and if not otherwise stated PEG as well as itaconic acid were pre-dried before use on a high vacuum line (< 10-3 mbar) overnight.
To avoid contamination with oxygen during the reaction and to remove produced water, common Schlenk technique was applied. As inert gas argon was used.

A1
Date: 02/06/15 – 03/06/15
Lab members: AW, SZ
 
Preparation process:
A 50 mL Schlenk flask was loaded with 1.213 g (3.033 mmol, 1 eq.) PEG-400 and 0.395 g (3.032 mmol, 1 eq.) itaconic acid and flushed with argon. Within 20 minutes the mixture was heated up to 100 °C with an oil bath and stirred under argon atmosphere. As a colorless melt had formed the vacuum was applied (3·10-2 mbar) and the mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 17 h. The slightly yellow viscous liquid was cooled down to room temperature. 
For a picture of A1 see appendix.
 
Analysis:
No further analyses were performed.
 
 
A2
Date: 09/06/15 – 10/06/15
Lab members: FR, SJ
 
Preparation process:
A 25 mL Schlenk tube was loaded with 2.169 g (5.422 mmol, 1 eq.) PEG-400, 0.705 g (5.420 mmol, 1 eq.) itaconic acid and capped with a septum. Within an hour the mixture was heated up to 145 °C with an oil bath and stirred under argon atmosphere. As a colorless melt had formed the vacuum was applied (< 10-3 mbar) and the mixture was stirred at 145 °C for 24 h. The slightly yellow viscous liquid was cooled down to room temperature.
For a picture of A2 see appendix.
 
Visual Observations:
During the reaction itaconic acid recrystallised on the flask surface which wasn’t dipped into the oil bath. Therefore the ratio between itaconic acid and PEG-400 has changed.
 
Analysis:
The product was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry DSC to identify the glass transition (Tg) temperature.
The Tg of A2 is -4.7 °C.
Figure 1: DSC- Plot of A2. The Tg of A2 is -4.7 °C

The mixture was heated up to 145 °C with an oil bath on air. No vacuum was applied and the mixture was stirred on air at 145 °C for 24 h. The orange-colored viscous liquid was cooled down to room temperature.
 
Visual Observations:

The solubility of product A3 increases with hydrophobicity of the solvent. But it is still good soluble in water and methanol. This indicates that alkene cross linking during the synthesis not occurred. And the polymer is linear shaped.
 
 
A4
Date: 11/06/15 – 12/06/15
Lab members: FR, SJ, AW, SZ
 
Preparation process:
A 20 mL snap-cap vial was loaded with 1.912 g (4.779 mmol, 1 eq.) PEG-400, 0.622 g (4.781 mmol, 1 eq.) itaconic acid and capped with a septum. The snap-cap vial was flushed with argon for 5 minutes and heated up to 145 °C with an oil bath. The snap-cap vial was almost complete dipped into the oil bath to avoid crystallization on the cold glass surface. The formed colorless melt was then stirred under slight vacuum for 24 h. Afterwards the orange-colored viscous liquid was cooled down to room temperature.
 
Visual Observations:
The orange-colored product was more viscous than A1 and A2. Viscosity and colour were comparable with A3. For a picture of A4 see appendix.

A14
Date: 12/08/15 – 13/08/15
Lab members: SJ
 
Preparation process:
A 20 mL snap-cap vial was loaded with 1.6155 g (26.027 mmol, 1 eq.) EG and 3.3853 g (26.021 mmol, 1 eq.) itaconic acid. For this experiment itaconic acid wasn’t pre-dried under high vacuum. The vial was capped with a pierced aluminium foil and the mixture was heated up to 145 °C with an oil bath on air. No vacuum was applied and the mixture was stirred on air at 145 °C over night.
 
Visual Observations:
During the reaction a film of ethylene glycol condensed on the vial wall. This is due to the boiling point of EG (197 °C). In this way the exact IA/EG ratio could be changed. The yellow-colored polymer is a rigid gel and not applicable for 3D printing. For a picture of A14 see appendix.
 
 
 
Analysis of the prepolymers with GPC
 
The prepolymers A10, A12, A13 and A15 were additionally analyzed by GPC (Gel permeation chromatography) to detect the average molar mass.
 
Method:
The metering was performed with the PSS Suprema HS column connect to a RID detector. NaNO3 (0.1 mol/l) was used as eluent by a flow rate of 1 ml/min and polyacrylic acid as polymerstandard for the calibration.
 
Results:
All assays were smaller than the smallest polymerstandard of 1250 g/mol. Therefor the average molar mass was not definable.
Overlaying the assays allows the comparison of the different prepolymers. Thereby, one can see that the polymers A 12, A13 and A15 are very similar and only A10 has a different curve. This reflect the composition of the prepolymers. While A10 is out of PEG 400 and IA, the prepolymers A12-A15 are out of PEG 200 and IA.

Curing of prepolymers
 
Prepolymers were mixed with different amounts of Ciba® DAROCUR 1173 photoinitiator and streaked on microscope glass slides. The slides were placed for different periods of time under UV-light 254 nm.
For pictures of the cured prepolymers see appendix.

By UV-curing of A8 on a polystyrene petri dish an interesting effect was observed. The hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of xylitol lead to formation of prepolymer drops due to the hydrophobic polystyrene surface of the petri dish. This effect is interesting because it could prevent adhesion of the polymer on the basin of the 3D printer during UV curing. Unfortunately A8 doesn’t cured by UV light, even not with 6 % DAROCUR 1173. For a picture see appendix.
