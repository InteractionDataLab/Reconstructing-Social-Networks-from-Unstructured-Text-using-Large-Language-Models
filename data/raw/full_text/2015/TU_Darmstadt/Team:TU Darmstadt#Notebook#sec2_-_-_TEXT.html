Methods and Materials of the iGEM Lab TU Darmstadt
Working on the last years’ iGEM projects resulted in a variety of protocols and recipes which were collected and sorted for creating “Molecular BioBricking – an iGEM lab manual”. “Molecular BioBricking” is meant to help rookies to get started and affords an opportunity for advanced iGEMers to look up tricky procedures.
As the name may suggest, most protocols refer to “Molecular Cloning: A lab manual”. To enlarge the spectrum of methods, protocols of several publications and utilized kits and were additionally added.
Feel free to share this lab manuals to facilitate your wetlab efforts.
Best wishes,
iGEM Team TU Darmstadt 2015
