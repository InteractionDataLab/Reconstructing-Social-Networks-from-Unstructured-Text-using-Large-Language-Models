SITEMAP
K1602023 - B0034-HistidinTag-Green fluorescent protein (B0034-His-GFP)
K1602022 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into T7-pSB1A2, followed by heat shock transformation of competent E. coli Top 10. Colonies were screened by colony PCR with VF2 and VR and positive colonies were inoculated. Extracted plasmids were cloned into pSB1C3 and used for protein expression in E. coli BL21.
