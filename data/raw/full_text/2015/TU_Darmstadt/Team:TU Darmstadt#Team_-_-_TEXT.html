Semester:
Hi, my name is Benjamin Mayer, I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt for my bachelor's degree in computer science and my master's degree in physics. I initially learned about iGEM during my bachelor thesis at the Computational Biology and Simulation group. As physicist and computer scientist I am equipped with a relatively broad theoretical knowledge from which I want to contribute to the team, e.g., in the field of modeling. For me personally iGEM is a chance to work with a large team, in comparison to the group sizes common for my field of study, on an interesting and multidisciplinary subject. Thus, through iGEM I can broaden my scope of knowledge and learn new team competences.

I joined iGEM because I like the idea of tackling a complex issue together with a team and work out solutions for it. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to experience independent and interdisciplinary research and to broaden one’s mind. I’m looking forward to learn new stuff and meet lots of interesting people.
Christian Sürder
Age: 29
Studies: Physics M. Sc.
Semester: 13
I have worked as a speech trainer and team attendant at the TU Darmstadt for a couple of years and supervised various student projects. I deal with issues of team formation, project control and interdisciplinary cohesion. Additionally, I am interested in the design and presentation of scientific contents like didactic reconditioning and mediation of complex topics. Already in 2014, I participated iGEM as project attender. This way I could gain much experience related to project control and teamwork. This year I want to gather these experiences to push the team using appropriate structures and improved concepts. Especially, I bear the challenge of the multidisciplinarity and I hope I can facilitate the establishment of iGEM as interdisciplinary competition of note within the TU Darmstadt.

Semester: 6
As one of several „winter-newcomers“ of the iGEM-team TU Darmstadt, I would like to come along with the enormously successful way the team started in 2014, and to take everything with me that is connected with such a big project. I am sure, that I will learn a lot in these months, from teambuilding to performing, as well as useful skills concerning the laboratory work. I really look forward to the collaboration within the team and the exciting challenges we are going to face until our final project is going to reveal the final results and we are allowed to present them on the big stage.

Semester: 8
I joined the iGEM team at a relative late time point of my studies. However, so far I have had only very few contact with synthetic biology. In the team I want to learn more about this field of biology and improve my scientific skills in the laboratory. I think our project is great and offers the opportunity to get insight into what it is like to do real research. Also, it is perfect to meet many people who are interested in the same topic, which enables the exchange of experiences.

What inspired me to participate in our iGEM team was the prospect of working on my own terms. To me it represents the possibility to escape the routines of the school-like everyday life of being a student and to gain knowledge autodidactically, which I would not otherwise.
Jonathan Pletzer-Zelgert
Age: 21
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Semester: 4
Even before I started my Bachelor in Biomolecular Engineering at TU Darmstadt I knew that I wanted to join the local iGEM Team. The possibility of being part in a group which actually does research this early in a scientific career was a huge motivation in school and later at university. Moreover synthetic biology itself fascinated me like no other science and just after a few months in my Bachelor I could say that I picked the right subject and definately had to spend a semester in the iGEM Lab.  This year I am in my fourth semester and finally able to participate. Beside everything we want to accomplish I´m also thrilled to learn Lab skills in such an intensity university itself often can´t provide.
Kathrin Hadasch
Studies: Biology B.Sc.
This year is the first time that I am taking part in iGEM. I am excited to finally work with many different people at our independently worked out project and help this team to live up on to last years’ achievements by bringing in my skills in the field of bioinformatics.

This year is my third time in the iGEM team. Again, it offers me the opportunity to cope with scientific issues in a practical manner. Thus it enables the one time chance to gather valuable insight and experiences to evolve myself.  I expect from the project that we present a solid solution and that I can gain experiences and have fun as part of the team.
Leon Kraus
Studies: Biology B. Sc.
I am one of the many new members of this year’s iGEM team. The achievements of last years’ teams are what fascinated me the most and also motivate me to put all my efforts into this project in order to live up to their success. I hope to be able to bring in and expand my abilities.

Semester: 12
Since 2010 I have worked besides my studies of biology as speech trainer and project attendant at the TU Darmstadt. Last year my brother and I already supported the iGEM team in the part of project management and team formation. We were glad our concept had paid off for the most part and that the project was completed successfully.  To do the project attendance and the challenge of the project cause my motivation for this year: especially the huge and interdisciplinary team.  All of us have our own concepts, no matter at which project, and we already have learned a lot. I am so excited to see if our new concept based on last year´s experience works and if it will bring our team to success in Boston.

Even before I became a student at the TU Darmstadt I wanted to be a part of their iGEM  team eventually. The opportunity of working on a specially arranged research project with many different people coming from a wide range of faculties is what I was most interested in. So that is the reason why I am taking part for the first time now. I am curious for the experience and knowledge I am going to gain in terms of lab work on the one hand and managing a team consisting of so many different people on the other hand. I am excited for the work that comes along with such a project and to use and expand my abilities.
Mirjam Haun
Studies: Biomolecular Engineering B. Sc.
Even before I started my Bachelor in Biomolecular Engineering at TU Darmstadt I knew that I wanted to join the local iGEM Team. I cannot wait to work in the Lab and turn own ideas into reality independently from protocols of standard internships.I hope to be able to help bring this team to success and gather many worthwhile experiences.

Semester: 6
Servus, my name is Niklas Hummel and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my fifth semester. I already participated on last year´s iGEM team and gathered a lot of positive experiences (not only in the laboratory) as well as networking with a lot of young, motivated students. That’s why I want to be a part of iGEM TU Darmstadt 2015. I am very excited to work on this huge team on own ideas and generate an extraordinary project.

Basically, I know the iGEM competition from TV. I thought, only high achiever with best grades could join such a team. When I found out that participation criteria are not more than fun and motivation it was clear: You must join them! I am totally curious to learn new practical experiences, which I can gather over time!
Phil Groenewold
Studies: Mechatronics M. Sc.
Age: 27
Semester: 10
Hi, my name is Phil and I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt. My motivation to participate in the iGEM-Team 2015 is the interdisciplinarity this year. Biologists, mathematicians, mechatronics, computer scientists and chemists are all working on one project which is a really interesting experience. I hope to learn a lot of new things from other students with the same interests.
Sebastian Barthel

Who took part once, will stick to it. The last year´s project showed me what is really important during studies. And that is not boring lectures, but practical work. Thus for me it was clear to remain with the team, even before we surprisingly achieved such successes in Boston.  After my activity as assistant project coordinator last year in which I first had to grow, my slogan for this year is “build on the successes of 2014 and let it roll!” Now, I am excited to take over the more scientific part of the project coordination. And I am hoping for a good team spirit.

I wanted to join the iGEM team since getting my study license. Unfortunately, it failed because of varying reasons. The more excited am I to be part of the team 2015. I cannot wait to work in the Lab and turn own ideas into reality independently from protocols of standard internships.  Let´s go, Boston is waiting!
Sebastian Jäger
Studies: Chemistry M. Sc.
As soon as I got asked if I wanted to help this year’s iGEM team I wanted to be a part of it. The opportunity to apply the knowledge I gained within my internship at the University and work on an own project with many different people was the main motivation for me to take part in this competition and put all of my effort and abilities into it.

It was the best choice of my previous studies to participate the iGEM team. An incredible year of iGEM is behind me in which I was able to try and learn a lot. A year ago I would have never believed that at the end I would stand in front of over 2000 scientists presenting our project. For this year we have set our sights high as well! As part of our project I want to make our team more interdisciplinary and establish iGEM as solid constant at the TU Darmstadt. I look forward to an exciting project with an awesome team. And I am happy to see our friends from all over the world in September at the Giant Jamboree!
Thomas Höhl

Semester: 8
Currently I am in the first year of my Masters degree and for the first time part of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt. I read about the publications of last year´s team and informed myself about the actual project. I got interested and I am excited to participate. I believe, that I will extend my horizon in a huge interdisciplinary team.
Tobias Wittenberg
Age: 28
Studies: Technical Biology M. Sc.
Semester: 8
After some talks to some fellow students it was clear that I want to join the iGEM team. I was informed about the free work of the last year´s project and what success was achieved. Besides spending time working on projects with fellow students, my primary goal is to improve my skills. For my work at iGEM I chose a topic I have never been in contact with. I appreciate Lab work, but I am more interested in learning new things as in this case the construction of the 3D printer.

Sven Jager
Studies: Ph.D. Biomolecular Engineering
Hello! As you can see I'm doing my PhD. I'm an oldtimer and therefore can't participate as a normal team member like I did before. So this year I work as an advisor for the team. My job is to be the mediator for frictions inside between team members. As I'm residing in the field of computational biology I'm also an advisor for the modelling group of our team.I hope I can help the team with my experience and inspire the younger students for the field of bioinformatics.
Thea Lotz
PhD Student Synthetic Genetic Circuits
As a former team member, it was self-evident that I would try and support the next generation of TU Darmstadt's iGEM student team.  It's interesting to experience the challenge of an iGEM project from a different view than that of an active student member, but I am looking forward to the chance to learn a whole new set of skills during this year's competition. I also look forward to meeting a lot of different teams from around the world, at the latest at the great Jamboree. See you there!

It is now the 4th iGEM that I am taking part in even though I thought 2014 was going to be the last time for me. Since I am working on my Master Thesis at the Keasling Lab in Berkeley I am only participating as an advisor this year. I will still support the team as much as possible with the experiences I have gathered so far!
