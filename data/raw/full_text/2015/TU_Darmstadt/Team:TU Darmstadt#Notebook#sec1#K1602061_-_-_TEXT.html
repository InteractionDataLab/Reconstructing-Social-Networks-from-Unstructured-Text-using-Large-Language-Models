SITEMAP
K1602061 - T7-B0034-Xylanase-Acetyl Esterase (T7-B0034-xynA-aes)
K1602060 was digested with SpeI and PstI and ligated into the vector harboring aes which before was digested with XbaI and PstI. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed with heat shock and positive colonies were screened by colony PCR  with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR and inoculated. Plasmids were extracted.
