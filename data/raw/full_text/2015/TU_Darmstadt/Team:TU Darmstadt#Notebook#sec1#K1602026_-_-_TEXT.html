K1602026 - T7-B0034-HistidinTag-Green fluorescent protein-SilicaTag4 (T7-B0034-His-GFP-Si4)
K1602025 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into T7-pSB1A2. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. Colonies were screened using a colony PCR with VF2 and VR (Figure 1).
Figure 1 Colony PCR of T7-B0034-His-GFP-Si4. All colonies (1-3) contained the insert of around 1.1 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder.
