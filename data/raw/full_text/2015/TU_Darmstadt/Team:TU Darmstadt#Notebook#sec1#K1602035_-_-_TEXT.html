K1602035  - T7-B0034-Xylanase-PDZ-ligand (T7-B0034-xynA-PDZlig)
K1602033 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into T7-pSB1A2. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. The plasmids were extracted and cloned into pSB1C3. Colonies were screened by colony PCR with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR (Figure 1).
Figure 1 Linker PCR of B0034-xynA (1). The size of the amplified product was around 0.8 kbp. DNA marker: Gene Ruler 1 kB DNA Ladder. (NEB).
