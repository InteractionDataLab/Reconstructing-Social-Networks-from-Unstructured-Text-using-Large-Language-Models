K1602062 - T7-B0034-Xylanase-PDZ-Ligand-Acetyl Esterase-SH3-Ligand (T7-B0034-xynA-PDZlig-aes-SH3lig)
K1602038 was digested with SpeI and PstI and ligated into K1602037 , which before was digested with XbaI and PstI. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed with heat shock and positive colonies were determined by colony PCR  with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR (Figure 1) and inoculated. Plasmids were extracted.
Figure 1 Colony PCR of T7-B0034-xynA-PDZlig-aes-SH3lig (1-4). The size of the amplified product was around 2.0 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder. (NEB).
