Parts
This page contains the BioBricks that our team created and distributed to the registry . BioBricks are the standardized building blocks of synthetic biology, they usually consist of circular DNA (plasmid) and a DNA sequence coding for a specific function like a protein or a promotor. The finalised BioBrick is based on the pSB1C3 vector which contains defined restrictions sites for an easy assembly and a chloramphenicol resistance for selection purposes.
In general three levels of complexity are distinguished:
- Simple parts like proteins, promoters, RBS, terminators
- Devices which consist of wired parts like a RBS in front of a protein sequence
- Systems are interconnected devices (like electric circuits) e.g. a combination of promoter, RBS, protein and terminator
Via combination of parts and devices a wide range of new functions can be generated. Assembling multiple parts can be achieved by recombination of cut parts.
