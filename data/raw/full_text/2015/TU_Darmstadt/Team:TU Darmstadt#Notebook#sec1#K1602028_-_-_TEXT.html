K1602028 - B0034-HistidinTag-Scaffold (B0034-His-Scaffold)
K1602027 was digested with XbaI and PstI, ligated into B0034-pSB1A2 and transformed into competent E.coli Top 10 cells. Colonies were screened by a colony PCR using the oligonucleotides VF2 and VR. Positive colonies were inoculated and the plasmids were extracted.
Figure 1 Colony PCR of B0034-His-Scaffold. Colonies 3 and 4 contained the insert of around 1.2 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder.
