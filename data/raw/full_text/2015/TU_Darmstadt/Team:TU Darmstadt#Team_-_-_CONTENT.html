Hello! As you can see I'm doing my PhD. I'm an oldtimer and therefore can't participate as a normal team member like I did before. So this year I work as an advisor for the team. My job is to be the mediator for frictions inside between team members. As I'm residing in the field of computational biology I'm also an advisor for the modelling group of our team.I hope I can help the team with my experience and inspire the younger students for the field of bioinformatics.

As a former team member, it was self-evident that I would try and support the next generation of TU Darmstadt's iGEM student team. 
It's interesting to experience the challenge of an iGEM project from a different view than that of an active student member, but I am looking forward to the chance to learn a whole new set of skills during this year's competition.
I also look forward to meeting a lot of different teams from around the world, at the latest at the great Jamboree. See you there!

It is now the 4th iGEM that I am taking part in even though I thought 2014 was going to be the last time for me. Since I am working on my Master Thesis at the Keasling Lab in Berkeley I am only participating as an advisor this year. I will still support the team as much as possible with the experiences I have gathered so far!
