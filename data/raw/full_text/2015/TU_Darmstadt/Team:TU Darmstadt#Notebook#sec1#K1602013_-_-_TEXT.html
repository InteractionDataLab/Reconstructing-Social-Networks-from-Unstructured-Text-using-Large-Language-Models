K1602013 - Aldehyde Reductase (YqhD)
Figure 1 PCR of yqhD. The size of the amplified product was around 1,4 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder (NEB).
The YqhD-gene was isolated from K12 E. coli and amplified by colony PCR using the YqhD (FW) and YqhD (REV) oligonucleotides. The PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with DpnI for 120 minutes and subsequently purified. The YqhD amplicon was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into a pSB1C3 vector using T4-ligase. E. coli Top 10 were transformed with the ligation product by heat shock transformation and the cells were spread out on a CMP agar plate. Clones were screened with colony PCR using VF2 and VR oligonucleotides. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones which were verified by sanger sequencing.
