Biotechnological production of itaconic acid in Escherichia coli
Figure 1 cis-aconitate decarboxylase (coded by cadA)
The compilation of our toolbox requires a molecule containing at least two carboxygroups for esterifications with polyalcohols.Â  Furthermore it is important that one compartment of the polymer contains a crosslinking functionality which composes bonds with other strings under specific conditions. A molecule that complies with both requirements is the dicarbonacid itaconic acid, which has an ethylene group that preserves the cross-linking functionality by addition reactions under radicalic activation.
Itaconic acid is already used as a Co-monomer for the synthesis of polyacrylates and vulcanized rubber as well as a basic module for biologically degradable Polymers that are for example used in packaging industry. The property to act as a Co-monomer with different other components has the consequence that itaconic acid is discussed as possible substitute for methacrylic acid that is utilized to date by petrochemical industry.(1)
Figure 2 Itaconic acid pathway including cis-aconitate decarboxylase
The conventional exploitation of itaconic acid is achieved by chemical synthesis or takes place in Aspergillus terreus where amounts of 80g/L are provided.(2)An important disadvantage of the recent production is the high costs of approximately US$4/kg. (3)
A possibility to achieve a better production of itaconic acid in a different host than Aspergillus terreus could be performed by the introduction of a single key enzyme of the Aspergillus pathway.
The cis-aconitate decarboxylase from Aspergillus terreus catalyzes the reaction of cis-aconitate to itaconic acid under loss of carbon dioxide. cis-aconitate is an intermediate of the TCA-cycle that occurs in most organisms. For that reason there are a lot of different possible hosts. We decided to use Escherichia coli which contains the whole TCA-cycle and is also well characterized.
