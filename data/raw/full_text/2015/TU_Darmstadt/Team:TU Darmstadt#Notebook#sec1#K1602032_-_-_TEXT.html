K1602032 â€“ T7-B0034-HistidinTag-Scaffold-SilicaTag4 (T7-B0034-His-Scaffold-Si4)
K1602031 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into T7-pSB1A2. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. The plasmids were extracted and digested with EcoRI and PstI and cloned into pSB1C3. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed and colonies were screened by colony PCR.
