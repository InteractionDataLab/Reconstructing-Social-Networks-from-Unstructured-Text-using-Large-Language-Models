K1602025 - B0034-HistidinTag-Green fluorescent protein-SilicaTag4 (B0034-His-GFP-Si4)
K1602024 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into B0034-pSB1A2 and transformed into E. coli Top 10. Colonies were screened by colony PCR with oligonucleotides VF2 and VR. Positive colonies were inoculated and the plasmids were extracted (Figure 1).
Figure 1 Colony PCR of B0034-Prefix-His-Tag-GFP-Si4 (1). Colony 1 contained the insert of around   1.1 kbp. DNA marker: 2-Log DNA Ladder.
