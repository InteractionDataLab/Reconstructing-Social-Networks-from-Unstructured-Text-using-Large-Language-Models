K1602020 - T7-B0034-Humicola insolens cutinase (T7-B0034-HIC)
K1602019 was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into T7-pSB1A2. Competent E. coli Top 10 were transformed via heat shock. Positive colonies were inoculated and plasmids were extracted. The construct was cloned into pSB1C3 and retransformed via heat shock into E. coli BL21 for protein expression.
