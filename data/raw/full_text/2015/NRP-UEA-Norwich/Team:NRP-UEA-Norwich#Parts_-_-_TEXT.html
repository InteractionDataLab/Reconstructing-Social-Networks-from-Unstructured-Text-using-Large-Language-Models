* This was converted to a standard BioBrick by cloning into the Mo-Flipper Plasmid K1467400 (complete transcriptional unit flipper) made by the NRP-UEA 2014 team. These parts were tested by cloning into a binary plasmid vector backbone prior to delivery to plants leaves using Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transfection.
** This was converted to a standard BioBrick by cloning into the Mo-Flipper Plasmid K1467300 (Terminator Flipper) made by the NRP-UEA 2014 team.
*** This is assembled in a Golden Gate Universal Acceptor Plasmid (pUAP1) in the pSB1C3 backbone, according to RFC 106. It is a Golden Gate part in the plant standard syntax, not a BioBrick.
