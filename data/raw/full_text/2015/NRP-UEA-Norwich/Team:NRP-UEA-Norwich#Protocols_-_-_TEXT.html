Starch Quantification Protocol
1. Harvest plant material (0.2-0.5 g) into capped tubes and freeze immediately in liquid nitrogen.
2. Once tissue is frozen, tubes can be transferred to dry ice. If starch content is to be expressed on a fresh-weight basis, sample weight can be determined either by weighing very rapidly prior to freezing, by re-weighing the sample-containing collection tubes, or by weighing out part of the frozen material for analysis. If starch content is to be expressed on a dry-weight basis, the sample can be freeze-dried and then weighed. To obtain a robust estimate of the starch content of a particular tissue, it will normally be necessary to collect and analyse several biological replicates.
3. Transfer tissue to a tube containing 5 mL 80% aq. vol/vol ethanol and incubate in a boiling water bath for 3 minutes.
4. Spin samples in a benchtop centrifuge at ≥3,000 x g for 5-10 minutes at room temperature, to pellet solids and discard supernatant.
5. Repeat this ethanol extraction twice more, discarding the supernatants. Allow ethanol to evaporate from the final pellet.
6. Transfer pellet to a mortar with a minimum volume of water and homogenise thoroughly to a smooth consistency. Transfer to a volumetric container and make up to 5 mL with water washings from the mortar. Where large numbers of samples are to be processed, ethanol-extracted pellets can be homogenised in small volumes of water in a multi-tube ball mill.
7. Add 0.5 mL of the homogenate to each of four tightly sealing screw-capped microcentrifuge tubes. After sealing, heat to 100°C for 10 minutes to gelatinize starch granules. Alternatively, samples can be autoclaved at 120°C.
8. Allow to cool. Add 0.5 mL 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to each tube. To two of the tubes add roughly 6 units of α-amyloglucosidase and at least 0.5 units of α-amylase. Add a solution of equivalent volume and composition without the enzymes to the other two tubes (control samples). Incubate tubes at 37°C for 4 hours.
9. Spin tubes in microcentrifuge at ≥10,000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature to remove particulate material.
10. Assay samples of the supernatant for glucose. Several assays for glucose are available.
11. Record OD340 and leave the cuvette in the spectrophotometer.
12. Place a minimal volume of a mix of 1 unit hexokinase and 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase onto a plastic microspatula and mix rapidly with the contents of the cuvette without removing it from the spectrophotometer. The OD340 is recorded again after a constant value is reached. This should take no more than 10 minutes.
13. Calculate the starch content content of the tissue.

One-Step Golden Gate Digestion Ligation Protocol
1.   Add ATP to buffer that will be used, as it is required for the T4 Ligase to work.
2.   Decide which buffer to use, restriction or ligase buffer. The protocol will differ depending on the buffer. BpiI is required to make level 0 constructs.
3.   To make level 0 parts using the ligase buffer, the following were added: 100-200 ng of acceptor plasmid, plasmids containing each module to be inserted in a 2:1 ratio of insert: acceptor, 1.5µL of T4 Ligase buffer with 200 units of the T4 DNA ligase, 1.5µl of Brovine Serum Albumin (10x) and 5 units of BpiI. They are then put in the following conditions: 20 seconds 37°C, (3 minutes 37°C, 4 minutes 16°C) X26, 5 minutes 50°C, 5 minutes 80°C, 5 minutes 16°C.
4.   To make level 1s, the type of buffer must again be decided. Using the ligase buffer will follow the same conditions as the level 0, but BsaI will be used.
5.   To make level 2s, repeat step 3 with the products of step 4 (optional)
6.   Use 5µl of the one-pot dig-lig reaction to transform electrocompetent E. coli cells.
