SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
Biological safety is our priority, especially when our focus are related to the agricultural business. Our team does not want to release and genetically engineered organism into the field, nor to contaminate crop by directly applying the bacteria into the field.
Two Approaches Ensuring Biosafety
Keeping a biological sample quarantined is the key to maintaining biological safety. As a responsible iGEM team, we will not release any of our genetically modified organism outside the laboratory. In our design, we emphasize keeping the biosensors in the laboratory and bringing a soil sample to the laboratory, instead of putting the biosensors to the field for in situ detection of NPK levels.
Using a non-living biosensor is another approach that came to mind. This way, even if the sensor is accidentally released into the field, it will not be able to sustain nor to propagate itself. We opt to use a cell-free transcription-translation system (CF TX-TL) system as the chassis of the non-living biosensors.
SAFETY TRAINING COURSES
This year's HKUST-Rice team members have received safety training over the summer. Topics that we have learned about in safety training are as follows:
For HKUST:
1. Biological Safety
2. Chemical Safety I/ Chemical Safety for Laboratory Users
3. Chemical Safety II/ Hazardous Waste Management
The link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST) can be                          directed to: http://www.ab.ust.hk/hseo/training.htm
For Rice University:
1. General Laboratory Safety
2. Blood Safety and Blood Borne Pathogens
The link to the laboratory safety training requirements of our institution (Rice University) can be directed to: http://safety.rice.edu/Training/Safety_Training_Requirements/
