He is very willing to share his view points and pass years of iGEM experiences. He is one of the busiest and most patient people in the lab, members queue up to show him their failing results and ask him “WHY?”. He has to answer everyone's questions, while having his own experiments going on at the same time. One more point to add, don’t be scared if he speaks mandarin to you.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="advisor"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> Park Hojeong Bonnie </FONT></B><B> 3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and Chemistry </B>

very smart and diligent advisor who likes to ask questions and help others. He is an 

expert in painting. He also likes funny dolls and playing computer games. Sometimes 

he can be quiet serious and very critical, but he can also be funny and entertain others. 

Another thing about him is that he is always seen together with Nadia, another

Bosco is always in a pink, purple or light yellow shirt with a bottle of Coca Cola from McDonalds in his hand. He loves to make up Chinese characters on the white board and ask Raul to read them. He also loves to write all kinds of languages spoken by our teammates on the white board, even if nobody can understand since all of them are from google translator. But he is always there when we need help and always teaching us how to make the most of the source we have. No problem is too serious for him and we are so glad to have him by our side. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="advisor"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> Bongso Nadia Benedicta </FONT></B><B> 3rd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering </B>

Jacqueline is a lovable and friendly person, she will be in the lab whenever she is free. Sometimes when you see her rush out of the lab, you will realize that she have to go to see her “fish”. She always share with us the funny things from last year’s team so as to cheer us up. It is our pleasure to have her as one of the advisor.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="project_content"><DIV class="project_row"><H1>Welcome to Rice!</H1><TABLE class="advisor"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> David Zong </FONT></B><B> 2nd year PhD in Systems, Synthetic and Physical Biology </B>
