Requirements for a Bronze Medal
Registered as iGEM team participating in Giant Jamboree. And sure we had fun!
✓
Here is our completed Judging Form.
✓
This is our Project Description. Documentation of our team part can be found in our wiki as well as in the registry .
✓
This is our poster .
✓
Take a look at our Attribution page , thanks to everyone that offered to help our team!
✓
PphoA ( BBa_K1682013 ) is a new BioBrick to the iGEM registry.
✓
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal
We tested PkdpF , and  it can sense potassium ion levels! Learn more on the Result page .
✓
Check out the documentation of PkdpF ( BBa_K1682009 ) on iGEM registry.
✓
We were curious about the public perception on using Biosensors and we did thorough investigation on it.
✓
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal
Based on the information provided in the investigation, we decided to use a cell-free system to alleviate biosafety concerns.
✓
ParaBAD is one of the most commonly used promoters in synthetic biology. Our team characterized it to test its “all-or-none” behavior. Check out this information on our wiki or in the iGEM registry.
✓
Our team faced a problem with conveniently taking gel photos, so we built our own DIY gel imaging machine , and it worked!
✓
Additional Achievement of Our Team
As a continuation of last year HKUST iGEM 2014 project, we followed up on ncRNA classification. An RFC document, "BBF_RFC_109_Categorization_of_ncRNA_in_Part_Registry" , is accepted by the BioBrick Foundation.
