Perception of HK stakeholders
Whilst risk assessment is a possible way to determine potential hazards, public communication   is another good practice in knowing how people think of our ideas. This year, we work beyond   the bench and inquire about the stakeholders’ opinions about microbial biosensor. The   collaboration of two universities expanded our focus group in the study of stakeholders’   perceptions on the use of microbial biosensor. We are curious if they feel discomfort with synbio   applications and if they will perceive an in-field microbial biosensor as a Pandora’s box.
Hypotheses
Future iGEMers may consider how a biosensor is designed for a safe use. In government and   international organisations’ shoes, they may consider how these applications should be   regulated to reassure the public that the use of microbial biosensor is safe.
Future work
Now, human proceed to another watershed in which we are manipulating microorganisms to   offset the harms we brought about along the history. Ethical issue on treating microorganism as   a machine for the betterment of our lives popped out in recent years. It is time to consider   whether we are the creatures specially fashioned by God or playing God is simply a   meaningless cliché.
