HKUST-Rice iGEM 2015 team is composed of 31 student members- 18 from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and 13 from Rice University; and 4 instructors, 2 from each university. Our team is the first cross continental team in iGEM. The benefit of forming a large joint team is that we have members from different fields who contribute different perspectives to the project. </P><H1>Greetings from HKUST!</H1><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> Ming Fung Cheung Eric </FONT></B><B> Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology </B>
As a responsible team leader, Eric devoted a lot of his time to iGEM. He is impassioned and consistently keeps track of each modules’ progress, (EVERY SINGLE STEP, to be precise.) While performing lab tasks, Eric is extremely focused and serious. However, he has a hidden sense of humor which only comes out if you have spent enough time with him. He can keep his blank chipmunk-like expressions and suddenly come up with a one-liner that makes everyone burst into laughter. He also has a STRONG obsession with riboregulator and other synthetic biological questions and we simply wish him all the luck to fulfill his curiosities.  
</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4">Siu Wang Ng Edward </FONT></B><B> Year 3 Biotechnology </B>
Edward is a pure gentleman. When you feel confused and discouraged by challenges, he will always say that it will be alright. He can really encourage someone even if that someone is totally lost! We do not know how he can remain calm in the face of adversity and so considerate to his teammates. Although being the Wise Man of our team he was caught red handed making origami out of aluminum foil! Team Edward!

A highly perseverant and smart teammate who actively engages in the project planning and laboratory work. A girl that brings lots of vitality to the team and her open-hearted character makes her easily approachable to everyone. She is also known as the Grandma because of the “buffering” time she needs to process when someone suddenly says something to her. Her priority and dedication to lab work is truly admirable.
</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4">Khandaker Samiha </FONT></B><B> Year 2 Life Science</B>
Samiha is a really sweet girl and you can feel it especially when she smiles at you and blink her eyes. She is in the expression platform group where she ran a lot of gel and did a lot of checking to make sure every step is reliable and successful. She was so obsessed with cloning her constructs that she woke up in the middle of the night asking &quot;So what do we ligate?&quot;. As a member of the design group, she also designs things unrelated to iGEM including building a snowman using leftover ice.

</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4">Kar On Cheng Karen</FONT></B><B> Year 2 Life Science </B>
Karen, well let’s just say the lab runs smoothly because of her. Every single day she manages to come to lab by 8:30 and no has been able to beat her record. All our daily needs, including LB, plates, autoclaved bottles, agar plates etc, is monitored by her tirelessly and voluntarily. If we can’t find something, she is the first person to go to. She can be so diligent and at the same time be the most cute and gem of a person to talk to.

Mona is an intelligent graphic designer who was one of the members working on our team  logos and T-shirt, using her profession in re-filling colors of logos using painting software. She has been very patient and helpful in modifying the wiki slider for numerous trials. While doing lab work, she highly focuses on her work to make sure everything goes right. However, the only area she needs to work on is improving her “eating speed”-one of the slowest eater.
</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> Tam Lut Fei Phoebe </FONT></B><B> Year 3 Biochemistry and Cell Biology </B>
Phoebe is an affable, joyful and the prettiest girl ;) Besides working in lab throughout the summer, she has also come up with some of the beautiful designs in the wiki and banner. She is also named “the human incubator” as she cannot feel the cold. I think most of us could remember her as the person who wore a T-shirt in winter while we were wearing a thick down jacket. So, if our incubator is gets to crowded, we could always use her!
</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="member"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><FONT size="4"> Yiu Pei Tung Stephanie</FONT></B><B> Year 3 Biotechnology</B>
Stephanie boosts up the intense lab atmosphere with her humorous jokes and her greetings with “Yo peeps!. Her making up cute stories for remembering each protocol helps her group mates go through each day without panicking. Days when she catches a cold are the lucky days in lab as she uses her Mickey Mouse voice to speak. Her intentional frown face in every photo makes it easy to spot her. The girl who is also known as the “gel smasher” has another side which is a very independent and confident person. Despite all her “swag” she manages to not miss a single day of lab and helps others by her own will. If you are having a bad day, just go to her as she is the person who will know how to cheer you up. A multi tasked and a valuable member every team needs.

Agnieszka, a Polish who somehow ended up in Hong Kong is one of the most fun person in Lab. One of her favorite procedure in the lab is microwaving the agarose solution to make gel for gel electrophoresis, a procedure she adores so much that she even made a historic gel with ddH2O instead of TAE Buffer (unintentionally!) and figured out the mistake after she ran the gel. Everyone’s laptop in the lab has tabs open for her to watch “cat videos” and read Polish news. Her strange catchphrase is “oh my God that’s disgusting!”.

Veronica left her native Southern California habitat to study bioengineering in Houston, TX.  She spends most of her days in lab engineering viruses (don’t worry, they’re the not-gonna-kill-you kind).  She’s always dancing, be it on the football field where she is captain of the dance team, in the library trying to memorize a complicated signaling pathway, or in lab during a wait step.  She loves to be busy, which is good because school, lab, and dance consume most of her time.  But, when she does get a break, Veronica enjoys reading fantasy novels, doing hot yoga, and eating yummy food with her friends (see picture).

Margaret, a rising junior, is pursuing a degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology.  A Louisiana native, Margaret has made Rice University her second home--specifically the lab where she works as an obliging slave to her constructs.  If she’s not in the lab, you’ll probably find her lending academic pearls of wisdom to her fellow students as a peer advisor and teaching assistant.  She enjoys many forms of entertainment in her (limited!) spare time--anything from refined orchestral performances to daring acrobatic feats posted on YouTube.  (We suspect she’s collecting data on how to become the next American Ninja Warrior.)   Margaret is incredibly excited to contribute to the revival of the Rice iGEM team--the school’s first since 2008--thanks to the support of HKUST!

Some say he swam to the US from China without stopping. Some say he invented a teleporter and teleported over to the US, but promptly destroyed it because why not? Others say he disguised himself as a normal person and flew over here like the rest of us normal folk. But one thing is for certain, this originally Chinese native is in the United States. This being, or whatever you call him, spends a lot of time at the gym, perfecting his already perfectly chiseled body. He is a studious, party animal, one of the few who can go out on a Saturday night and still complete his differential equation homework afterwards at 3 am. He is currently a sophomore pursuing bioengineering at Rice University, and is already learning how to make bacteria perform his bidding. However, just like Superman has his kryptonite and Scooby Doo his Scooby snacks, Peter Tang does have his weaknesses. He cannot say no to a homemade cookie and is addicted, ADDICTED to Pirates of the Caribbean, this dude just can’t get enough.
