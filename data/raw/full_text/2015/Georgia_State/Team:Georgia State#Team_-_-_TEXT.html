Our Team
The 2015 GSU-iGEM team is made up of extraordinary men and women. In the last nine months we have gone from having no lab experience to where we are today. We have collaborated with local Atlanta businesses, such as the Atlanta Botanical gardens, reached out to Georgia Legislatures, and educated thousands of children about synthetic biology. Continually pushing to better ourselves and overcome challenges we have grown as individuals, scientists, and a team this year. Some of our hobbies are: autoclaving keyboards, playing with Legos, and Tran’s promotering.
