CBDA Synthase
CBDA Synthase
Cannabidiolic-acid (CBDA) synthase is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of cannabigerolic-acid(CBGA) into cannabidiolic acid or CBDA(Futoshi et.al, 2007). Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotropic constituent of  the fiber-type cannabis plant which can be found in CBD oil, and it is obtained from non-enzymatic decarboxylation of CBDA (Takeda et.al, 2012). It is important to produce the CBGA to CBDA pathway synthetically independent of cannabis plants in order to insure the creation of CBD  and not psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This is important because CBD oil can be used as an effective form of treatment for various disorders such as: seizures, cancer, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Crohnâ€™s disease.Since the CBDA synthase is 83.9% similar to THCA synthase in its 544-amino acid overlap, it should be possible to synthesize CBDA synthase in a similar fashion THCA synthase  which has been synthesized multiple times (Futoshi et.al, 2007).
Construct Design
CBDA Synthase
CBDA Synthase is also known was cannabidiolic-acid synthase. It does not activate cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and it has shown promise in treating many diseases or conditions such as: seizures, cancer, anxiety, pain, and many others. Since the CBDA synthase is 83.9% similar to THCA synthase in its 544-amino acid overlap, the synthesis of CBDA synthase should be similar to THCA synthase (Futoshi et.al, 2007) .
Horseradish Peroxidase
In an effort to show proof of concept for the CBDA synthase portion of the project, the GSU-iGem team is using horseradish peroxidase transformed into agrobacterium then producing transgenic tobacco plants. This part was designed in accordance to RFC 10.
Experimental Design
CBDA Synthase
pORE vector, agrobacter, plants. We will test this concept with the HRP part we designed.
Results
CBDA Synthase
Though sequencing has not been confirmed yet, we probably ligated the CBDA Synthase part into pSB1C3. We will continue work on this next year.
