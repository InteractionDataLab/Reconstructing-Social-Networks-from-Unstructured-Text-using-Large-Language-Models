Team Parts
Our team added 4 new parts to the registry: two basic and two composites.  The basic parts include the protein coding sequences for Keratinase A or KERA (BBa_K1717171) and Keratinase US or KERUS (BBa_K1717172).  The composite parts are made up of an RBS and IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_J04500), as well as the gene for KeratinaseA  (BBa_K1717000) or KeratinaseUS (BBa_K1717173).  The following includes information on all parts and links to the registry part pages.
