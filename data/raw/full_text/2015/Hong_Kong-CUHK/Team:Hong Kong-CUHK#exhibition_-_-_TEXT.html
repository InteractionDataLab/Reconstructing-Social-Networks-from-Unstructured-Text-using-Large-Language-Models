Workshop Description
On 4th of July we held a workshop called "A day as a scientist in CUHK" for F4-6 students from various   Hong Kong secondary schools. This event aims to benefit high school students by providing them a   platform to learn more about synthetic biology and to have a taste of what itâ€™s like to work in a lab at   University.  Additionally, students also got a chance to meet peers who had the same passion for science   from other local schools.
Workshop Activities:
1. Introduction and Ice-breaking
- Various ice-breaking games were played in order to let them get to know each other. We all had a very   entertaining time.
2. First Lab Session
-  Basic knowledge of lab-wares and lab safety was taught by our iGEM-ers. Students learnt about   accurate measurement by using pipettes and experienced making their own agarose gel!
3. Lunch Time and University Tour
- During lunch hour, students toured around our big campus and enjoyed delicious food provided by   various canteens.
4. Second Lab Session
- After learning basic lab techniques, students started doing more challenging lab-work such as dye   loading and performing gel electrophoresis. Students found them tricky but fun!
5. Mini Talks
- After the lab sessions, it's time for learning more about synthetic biology! We also introduced them our   project which they found interesting and meaningful.
6. Group Photo Time
- It was such a memorable day with so much to experience as we gathered here in CUHK, bounded by   our common passion for synthetic biology. Organizing a full day workshop isn't an easy task, but we   were so full of energy and enthusiasm that every participant had a great time and found this interactive   workshop fun and fruitful!
