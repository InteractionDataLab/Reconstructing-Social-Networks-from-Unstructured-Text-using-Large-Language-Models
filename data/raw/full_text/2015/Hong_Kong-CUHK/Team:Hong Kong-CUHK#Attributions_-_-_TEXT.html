iGEM
Together we are, CUHK iGEM TEAM 2015
Members United:
Team Captain: Louis
Hi!I am Louis, a year 3 biochemistry student in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and team leader this year. Welcome to our wiki page and hope our project interest you. If you have questions about our project or just want to chat with us :P, feel free to contact us. See you in the Great Jamboree.
Vice Team Captain: Sharon
Hey there! I am Sharon, a year 3 undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry. Participating in iGEM has been very exciting, and I am looking forward to meeting other teams from all over the world!!!
Vice Team Captain: Alex
Hi, I am Alex, a year 2 biomedical engineering student. I am keen on lab and I believe that DNA, such a small thing can change the world. Thankfully I can see the world through the iGEM competition.
Secretary: Gigi
Hi everyone, I am Gigi, a year 2 biochemistry teenager. iGEM is such an exciting platform for one to generate and execute any creative ideas. Not only can I apply what I have learnt in lectures but also I can learn a lot through own exploration and through team buddies from many other disciplines. This is so cool ~♡
Treasurer: Henry
Second year student studying molecular biotechnology.
I participate in iGEM 2015 as I am interested in synthetic biology and it also provides an opportunity to meet people from all over the world during the competition.
Wet Lab Team: Alyssa
Hi, I am Alyssa, a year three biochemistry student. I am glad to join iGEM2015. Teammates, knowledge are the precious things I have gained from iGEM. Work hard, play harder!
Wet Lab Team: Emily
Hello! I’m Emily, a year 2 Biomedical Engineering student. The reason for me to join iGEM is to gain the experience of doing lab, because I am an engineering student which means I don’t have a lot of chances to do life science labs. I also learnt to cooperate with a team of members with different personalities. It's a unique experience!
Wet Lab Team: Jimmy
Hi, I am Jimmy, a year2 science student form biochemistry major. I have chosen to join iGEM team because I want to learn some techniques in doing experiment and learn how to work with others.
Wiki and Modeling Team: Peter
Hi, everyone! I am Peter, year 2 student studying biomedical engineering. I am so passionate about genetic engineering and feel excited in participating iGEM 2015. It is a great opportunity for me to meet people from all over the world. It also leads me to explore new frontiers and gain perfect experience in different biological perspective.
Wiki and Modeling Team: Angel
Hello! I am a Year-3 Engineering student. I enjoy making new friends and working with my team members. I want to learn more and do research in the lab. I also want to make more friends from other countries. Therefore, I join the iGEM team and the experience is great.
Design Team: Matthew
Hi! I am so excited to participate in iGEM 2015 CUHK team. It is definitely a great opportunity as an engineering student to carry out a project with science students. This lets me know how an engineer helping the project and put the idea into real products. I am also responsible for some art work in this team.
Policy and Practice Team: Carol
Hello! I’m Carol, year 2 molecular biotechnology student. I’ve always been interested in biology, art and poetry. It’s my pleasure to join iGEM this year to learn different new things in an interesting way with a great team of people!
Policy and Practice Team: Connie
Hi. I'm Connie. A year 2 food and nutritional sciences student. I'm glad to be a member of iGEM team because I can explore and learn a lot in this event.
Instructor: Asa
I participated in iGEM a few years ago. It was my first experience of research and directed me to pursue postgraduate study. Now I am working in the field of structural biology.
Instructor: Cynthia
Hi, this is Cynthia! I’m a Ph.D student in Food and Nutritional Sciences. This is my first time joining CUHK iGEM team as an instructor. It has been an amazing journey working with aspiring and passionate team members who have been dedicated themselves in overcoming challenges and carried out innovative ideals. Hope to see intriguing ideals in Giant Jamboree~
Instructor:  Jane
Hi, I’m Jane. I’m a final year PhD student in School of Life Sciences in CUHK, with research focus on endocrine effects of environmental pollutants in fish. I’m so glad to work together with the iGEM team this year. All iGEMers are full of energy and fantastic! Can’t wait to see the final competition where all awesome ideas, including our “Magneto-bacter vinelandii”, are exchanged and direct to more exciting further applications!
Instructor: Jacky
Jacky is a final year PhD student in School of Life Science at CUHK. His research focus is aptamer technology and its integration on bio-sensors development for downstream applications. He also studies the mechanism of multi-drug resistant cancer, focusing on the organelle-specific targeted drug action.
Instructor: Leo
Hello everyone, I am Leo Seak, a Macau student studying cell and molecular biology in CUHK. I was in the team of 2014 and becoming student instructor this year. I love anything unknown in this world. I think iGEM is exciting that you can explore synthetic biology and I cannot wait to see what iGEMers have done this year in Giant Jamboree!
Instructor: Stephen
Hi! I'm Stephen, currently a graduate student focusing on plant cell biology research. Apart from having a taste of synthetic biology, which constantly surprises me with fascinating ideas, I'm honoured to guide a team of enthusiastic students with great perseverance. I hope the team can enjoy themselves and I'm looking forward to seeing other new ideas in the coming competition!
Professor KM Chan
Prof. King Ming Chan is an Associate Professor of School of Life Sciences and Director of Environmental Science Program, Faculty of Science, Chinese University. His research focuses on Aquatic Toxicology and Molecular Endocrinology using fish models.  Dr. Chan also studies the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and transcription, focusing on understanding how metal-regulatory-element-binding transcription factors (MTFs) control metallothionein genes and how Pit-1s control pituitary polypeptide hormone genes.
Professor TF Chan
Prof. Ting-Fung Chan is an Assistant Professor in the School of Life Sciences, and the Deputy Director of the Centre for Microbial Genomics and Proteomics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He is the Coordinator of the CUHK iGEM team. His researches mainly focus on genomics and bioinformatics of microbial pathogens and complex human phenotypes. He enjoys talking about science, but even more so for toys: Mindstorms NXT, RX-178, 5D Mk-II, LX200-ACF, YAS-875EX, and iGEM. He wishes his students would comprehend the fun and excitement of all aforementioned, but if that is not possible then at the very least, iGEM.
Professor SK Kong
Prof. Kong's laboratory studies the process of apoptosis. In particular, he is interested in elucidating how mitochondria regulate the apoptosis in 'normal' and drug-resistant cancer cells. He wonders how the resistance of mitochondria to MMP can explain the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis induction, and he hopes to develop strategies for overcoming chemotherapy resistance by targeting tumor mitochondria. He believes that pharmacological interventions on mitochondria are good strategies to promote cell death in tumor cells. This research topic on apoptosis is therefore relevant to disease treatment with socioeconomic impacts.
