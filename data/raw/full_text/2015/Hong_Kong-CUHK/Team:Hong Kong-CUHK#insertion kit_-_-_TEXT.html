Insertion Kit for Protein Expression on Magnetosome Membrane
Figure 1: The structure of the transmembrane mamC protein
This simple construct consists of mamC gene, a gene coding for a transmembrane protein (1) (Figure 1) on the magnetosome membrane. Unlike usual recombinant methods to put our insert between multiple restriction sites, we put mamC in front of them. Now any protein we desired can be attached onto the magnetosome membrane just by fusing it with the mamC gene by inserting it between the multiple restriction sites.
(For your interest, this is done by removing the stop codon of mamC and the start codon of the desired protein, for example an antibody, making it a mamC-fused protein).
As we are now putting multiple restriction sites downstream of mamC, therefore we can insert any desire genes afterwards. Thus, we name it our insertion kit.
