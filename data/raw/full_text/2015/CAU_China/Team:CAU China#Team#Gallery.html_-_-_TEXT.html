Hi,everyone!I am a student in the college of biology science in CAU. It is a great honor for me to take part in this great event. I love doing experiments with my teammates. Wish all of you have great time in Boston, good luck.
Yang Zi
Hello, my name is Yang, Zi. It’s such a pleasure for me to join the iGEM team in our university and get to know the fascinating synthetic biology. Every time when we had a team conference or a journal club, it really gave me a lot of new ideas. The feeling of discussing interesting questions with interesting people can be incredibly excellent. During the process of finishing our project, I also found my future research interest---system biology in signal transduction. Now I can proudly say I know what I really want, and that’s because of this wonderful year together with iGEM!
Hu Yao
This is Ricky. Complexity and simplicity both lies within me. I love to explore and elaborate. One day if I die accidentally, my last words would be: see what I've found !
Wang Chen
It is a wonderful experience to take part in the iGEM contest, I have learned a lot through the process. Our project aims to put forward a possible application of synthetic biology in agriculture. We hope to solve the problem of herbicide resistance someday if possible.
Ji Yinghui
Joining iGEM team is one of the most significant things in my college life. In this team, I've learned to do work efficiently and gotten a lot by learning Synthetic Biology. I'm proud to be a CAU-iGEMer!
Li Chen
Li Chen, a student of Honors Class in CAU, majoring in life science. With a great interest in biology experiments, she started to learn experimental skills in a lab about genetics and molecular biology at the beginning of the sophomore year. At the meantime, she became an iGEMer of CAU. Swimming, singing and drawing are her hobbies for relaxing. She always believes that everything done is worthy.
Zheng Qilin
Hi, I’m Zheng Qilin, from CAU igem team. I study biological science. My favorite NBA team is Boston Celtics. It's a pity that I can't come to Boston to join in the Giant Jamboree but I'm still very excited.And finally, wish our team a good luck!
Wang Ke
Hi, I’m Ke. It’s really fantastic to participate in this team. The meetings between members give me much inspiration and courage to seek for my interest on biology science. I like the brain storms to design our project, it’s somehow hard but fun. The ideas of IGEM attracts me a lot, and I enjoy every efforts I contributing to our team. Although we’ve met difficulties, surely we had got and will get over them with enthusiasm. It’s really nice to meet all of you.
Shang Xiaotong
Holly！I’m Xiaotong, from China Agricultural University, I’m a happy girl! I love to study in college of biological science. I’m also happy to be a member of our iGEM team. Science is so amazing! There are still so many secrets about lives, let’s find them one by one!

The name of mine means easy sunny day, Warmth and ease and hurray. The goal of mine is chasing simple way, To hope and learn and enjoy.  Hope is like a seed in soil seeking for warm light. Learning is the thing that we all wish it easy. Enjoy, no need to say, the best way to hurray. For tomorrow and today, acting on my dream.
Yang Yang
I am a senior student in China Agricultural University. I major in Biology Science and I love math, which make me passionate for systematic biology and make my study easier. I want to continue my graduate study in Systematic Biology or something like that. I hope I can make a long journey in this field.

I am Qi-Jun Chen, a faculty from China Agricultural University. I am happy to have the opportunity as one of advisors of CAU_China iGEM team. I learned a lot about iGEM from the team, and shared a variety of wonderful ideas. I hope to provide more and useful suggestions, as well as technical supports, for the team in the future.
Wang Na
CAU_China is a family. Everyone learns, thinks, discusses, and has fun in this family. I learn fresh ideas from all members. Most of the time, I feel like a happy student more than an instructor. And synthetic biology brings me so much surprise and fun. As a teacher, I hope students to explore more fields and pay more attention to the effects on life.  Synthetic biology can change the world! But I have so much regret in this year. I don’t have enough time to talk with team members. I don’t pay more attention to the latest advances. But I will not change the belief that we can make more beautiful life by synthetic biology!
