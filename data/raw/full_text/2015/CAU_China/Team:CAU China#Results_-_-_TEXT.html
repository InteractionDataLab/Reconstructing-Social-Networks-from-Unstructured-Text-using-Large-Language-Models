Project Results
In our project, we create 4 kinds of transgenic plants. All of them have the resistant to two kinds of herbicides. We use the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A polyprotein to link to two different resistant genes. In the modeling part, we try to use computer modeling to predict which kind of protein can be linked with 2A and the how the 2A polypeptide affects the protein's function.
