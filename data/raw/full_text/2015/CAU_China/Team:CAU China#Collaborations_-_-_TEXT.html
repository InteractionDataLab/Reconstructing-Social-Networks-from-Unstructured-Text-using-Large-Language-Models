Cooperation with ZJU iGEM team
We were in close contact with ZJU iGEM team and talked about our progressivity and experiences in labs from time to time. We used to help each other out when we run into problems with our experiments. We offered them a bacterial strain they needed.
Apart from this, we also kept in touch with multiple iGEM teams all over China, offering them various help including tips on delivering the sample package to the iGEM headquarters and offered suggestions on modeling to OUC iGEM team.
