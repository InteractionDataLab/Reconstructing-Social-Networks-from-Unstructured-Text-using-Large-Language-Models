Design
In our project, we designed 4 kinds of genetically modified Arabidopsis that are resistant to 3 different prevailing herbicides respectively. We grew their seeds on the media containing the corresponding herbicide and they showed a sharp contrast with the wild type plant in terms of living status. The functioning test of each sole gene in other plants turned out be be successful and some Agri-biotech companies even developed  and marketed single herbicide resistant crops, which gave us confidence in the promising result of the co-expression of these genes and bio safety issues, and the field experiment is now in progress.
Fig1 4 designed vectors.
We linked each pair of herbicide resistant genes with a designed linker 2A, which will cleaved itself from the growing peptide chain spontaneously in the translation in ribosome and the translation goes on, so that both of the two proteins are yielded and that's how the co-expression of the two genes can happen.

Experiment group with double herbicide resistant plasmids inserted can sustain a normal life, while wild type cannot.

The idea of developing double herbicide resistant crop is being practiced on maize in the field test in our school.
