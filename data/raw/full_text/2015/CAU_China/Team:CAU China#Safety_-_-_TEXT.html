Safety in iGEM
Safe Project Design
We choose the pHSE400 as the chassis because it is non-pathogenic
Our experimental material is Arabidopsis thaliana so it is absolutely safe
While we proceed gel-electrophoresis, we use ethidium bromide. In order to prevent us from the ethidium bromide pollution, we wore plastic gloves. What's more, we wore surgical masks and latex gloves when we handle the bacteria
What we have to pay attention to is that we should carefully deal with the seed to prevent the gene dispersal. Make sure the resistant gene won't drift into the weeds.
Safe Shipment
We send our biobricks to company for safety identification before we send them.
Bio safety
We have plans to make further modifications to the system, adding a toxic gene in between the two target genes in case of super weed caused by genetic drift. And the application of this vector is restrained within the crops that won't be disturbed by the toxin. In our bettered system, only one herbicide gene is at the risk of drifting because if more genes were to drift into another species, it would definitely include the toxic gene and disrupt the normal life of weeds and thus can't live. The genetic drift rate of each gene is at the end of the day very low, and present prevention methods are proven to be efficient. With our modification, this problem is kept at a even smaller scale.
