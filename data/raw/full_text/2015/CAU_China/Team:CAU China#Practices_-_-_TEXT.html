A survey on the public knowledge of genetically modified food
Question 1. Have you heard of genetically modified food?
Question 2. Where did you learn about genetically modified food?
Question 3. Which one(s) is(are) commonly genetically modified according to your knowledge?
Question 4. The proportion of GM food in your daily consumption
Question 5. What is your attitude towards GM food, and why?
Analysis
Media preference dominant public opinion on GM food.As can be seen in the pictures, a rather large proportion of the participants receive information concerning GM food through TV programs, magazines, newspapers, and the internet, which means the news agencies behind these information terminals have a large role to play in terms of public awareness.
The competitiveness of GM food mainly comes from its price and quality.According to the GM food supporters, the main competitiveness of GM food come from its prices and its nutritional advantages due to genetic engineering. These people have a deeper understanding of GM food, and they even can tell me why GM food can be sold at a much cheaper price (like the reduction on the use of pesticides).
Logic trap -- Harmful till proven safe.Not a single scientist have the courage to make a universal affirmative judgment on the safety of GM food, leaving it to a suspended problem so that media can build their ‘imaginations’ upon. And to the public the best way possible is to assume GM food to be harmful until clearly proven safe.
When we look at the survey as a whole, we still find the general public very concerned about the safety of GM food, and they're not worrying about nothing. The genetic drift is literally an issue we have to deal with if we are to develop GM food. So this problem gave us inspirations in the future of our project. We should care more about the genetic drift issue. And this is where exactly our idea about the gene safe box idea come from. So special thanks to the lovely people who were really kind and sweet to spare their time to help us with our survey!
