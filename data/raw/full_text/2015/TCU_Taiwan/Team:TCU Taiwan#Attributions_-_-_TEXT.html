National Taiwan Ocean Unirversity Dr. Chang-Jer Wu
Dr. Chang-Jer Wu shared his experimental research knowledge and experiences --Use of the antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1 to protect against MRSA infection in mice with skin injuries, which has significantly inspired us and is instrumental to our experimental design.
Academia Sinica Dr. Jyh-Yih Chen
Dr. Jyh-Yih Chen provided the Epinecidin-1 plasmid as well as his research data and results of Epinecidin-1. His data has provided us the opportunity to advance our foundation and understanding of the antimicrobial peptide and translated to more efficient progress for our project.
DA.AI Technology Dr. Shih Ting Hong
Dr. Shih Ting Hong has shared his invaluable professional experience and advice regarding market value and applicability of wound dressing. He has also provided suggestions on product packaging designs. We are grateful for his recommendations as it allowed us to develop our project’s guidelines.
Chang Gung  Unirversity Professor Mu-Yi Hua
Professor Mu-Yi Hua has provided her experience and offered his advice towards development of product design and wound dressing considerations.
Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital Dr. Chien-Hsing Wang
Dr.  Chien-Hsing Wang has suggested evaluating the different types of wounds and taking it into consideration for dressing design. He has also provided different brands of wound dressings on the market for reference.

Miss. Shih-Ci Du
Mrs. Sin-Yi You
Miss. Ya-Zong Jhuang
Mrs. Hsien-ting Huang
They have given us a tremendous amount of assistance for the operation of this team to help us proceed smoothly and efficiently, including the application of funds and the use of laboratory equipment.
Mr. Chien,Hung-jen
Thanks to Mr.Chien, Hung-jen , the member of 2011 TzuChiU_Formosa iGEM team. He gave us suggestions to our presentation and shared his experience in iGEM. During our participation in 2015 Asian conference, he accompanied us every day to improve our presentation skills.  We appreciate his presence and advice to help our team progress.
Mr. Weng,Wei-Hsiang
Thanks to Mr. Weng,Wei-Hsiang , the studuent of Life Science. He taught us how to use software to predicted our protein secondary structure.
Mr. Frank Sy
Thanks for the volunteer of Boston Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation. He helped us improve our English skill and also re-edited the article in our wiki page. He gave us suggests to made TCU_Taiwan 2015 iGEM team became better and better.
2013 TU-Delft
This year we used the antimicrobial peptide signiferin as our main reagent. Through the 2013 TU-Delft iGEM team, they have kindly sent us their plasmid with signiferin and allowed us to work on our project.
2014 TCU_Taiwan
Thanks for the leadership of 2014 TCU_Taiwan.  Their advice allowed us to quickly become familiar with this competition and helped us become more efficient in the team's operation.
