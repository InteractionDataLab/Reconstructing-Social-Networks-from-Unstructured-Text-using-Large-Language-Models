•  * PCR signiferin
2% gel. The PCR product of signiferin should be 100~200 bp. But, there isn’t any band on it. Therefore, we consider that we PCR fail.
Aug. 6th ,2015
•  * PCR signiferin
2% gel. The PCR product of signiferin should be 100~200 bp. As the result, there is band between 100~200 bp on sample 2 so we consider it is correct.

•  signiferin TA plasmid purification
0.8% gel. The size of TA plasmid with signiferin insert should be 2000~3000 bp. In addition, plasmid will become sorpercoil so it will run faster. Therefore, we consider these are the correct plasmid.
Aug. 16th ,2015
•  pQE60 plasmid digest with enzyme BamH I and Nco I biobrick digest with enzyme EcoRI and Pst I
2% gel. The size of signiferin insert should be 100~20 bp. In addition, the signiferin insert in biobrick should be a little bigger than in pQE60. As the result, these two are all the correct sample we need.

0.8% gel. There are band on sample 1~7 of pQE60 plasmid with signiferin insert, but the size of our plasmid should be 3000 to 4000. As the result, these samples are not the plasmid we need.
Aug. 21st ,2015
•  PCR Epi-1 insert
2% gel. It is the correct size that Epi-1 PCR product have band between 200~300 bp. But, there is also band on blank. We consider it was polluted when we add reagent.
•  ligate TA vector and Epi-1 insert •  plasmid purification of pQE60 vector with signiferin insert

Aug. 23rd ,2015
•  enzyme digestion to check the clone of pQE60 vector with signiferin insert
2% gel. The size of signiferin insert should be 100 to 200 bp. But, there are no band on each sample. We consider that the signiferin insert have not been ligated.
•  Enzyme digestion to check the clone of biobrick with signiferin
2% gel. The size of signiferin insert should be 100 to 200 bp. There is band on the sample 2 of enzyme digest product. As the result, we can make sure that the signiferin has been ligated in backbone.
