Fig.1 Gel electrophoresis for biobrick BBa_K1727000Finally, we used EcoRI and PstI these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in the biobrick. We used 2% gel. The size of signiferin insert should be 100 to 200 bp. There is band on the sample 2 of enzyme digest product. As the result, we can make sure that the signiferin has been ligated in backbone.
Signiferin is a kind of antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has extensive abilities to kill Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to have more efficient to get Signiferin, we treated signal peptide on the upstream of N-terminal to facilitate the peptide production. To make sure the secretion system is work we had modified the amino acid sequence by attached an Ala at the N-terminal of Signiferin and change originally sequence into E.coli codon usage.

Finally, we used EcoRI and PstI these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in the biobrick. We used 2% gel. The size of Epinecidin-1 insert should be 200 to 300 bp. There are bands on the sample 1~8 of enzyme digest product. As the result, we can make sure that the Epinecidin-1 has been ligated in backbone.
Epinecidin-1 is a kind of antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) comes from the skin mucus of Epinephelus coioides. It has extensive abilities to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. Moreover Epinecidin-1 has ability to help wound healing and has been proven by animal studies.

The size of signal peptide insert should be 100 to 200 bp. There are bands on all the sample of enzyme digest product. As the result, we can make sure that the signal peptide has been ligated in backbone.
This signal peptide is comes from the signal of chitinase C that extracted by S.lividans. It had been proved that can worked in E.coli and successfully secret target protein to LB culture medium. At the secretion system of E.coli peptidase will identify the cleavage site Ala-Gln-Ala and cut at the double Ala at the signal and mature peptide linkage site. Finally, secreting out mature peptide into the culture medium.
Epinecidin-1 is a kind of antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has extensive abilities to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. Moreover Epinecidin-1 has ability to help wound healing. In order to have more efficient to get Epinecidin-1, we treated signal peptide on the upstream N-terminal of Epinecidin-1 to facilitate the peptide production. To make sure the secretion system is work we had modified Epinecidin-1 amino acid sequence by attached an Ala at the N-terminal of it.
Signiferin is a kind of antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has extensive abilities to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. It plays a role in defense mechanism for Crinia signifera to against microbes. Signiferin has demonstrated effectiveness in killing Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and has been proven by the TU-Delft 2013 iGEM team.
