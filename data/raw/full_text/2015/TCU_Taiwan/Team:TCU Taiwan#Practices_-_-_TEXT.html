National Taiwan Ocean University Meeting with Dr. Chang-Jer Wu
May 7th,2015
It’s with great pleasure to invite Dr. Chang-Jer Wu to share with us his experience.   Dr. Chang-Jer Wu has published research on the function of Epinecidin-1 in wounded mice in 2013 (research title: Use of the antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1 to protect against MRSA infection in mice with skin injuries). Building on this research, during our preparation, we decided to bring Epinecidin-1 into the wound dressing design. Dr. Chang-Jer Wu’s extensive research experience has made a significant impact on our experimental design and we are grateful and appreciative for his research to translate into constant progress with our project.
