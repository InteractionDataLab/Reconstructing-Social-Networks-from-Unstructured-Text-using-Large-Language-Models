• Aarol  completed  our team’s logo design
May 7th ,2015
•  It’s a great pleasure for us to invite Dr. Jhang Jhe Wu to share his experience. Dr. Jhang Jhe Wu published a research on the function of Epinecidin-1 in wounded mice in 2013 (research title: Use of the antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1 to protect against MRSA infection in mice with skin injuries).We read the research during our preparation, and decided to bring Epinecidin-1 into our wound dressing design. It’s extraordinarily significant for us that Dr. Jhang Jhe Wu shared his own experience in doing the research with us, which turns out to be a blueprint of our experimental design. Thanks to the assistance from Dr. Jhang Jhe Wu, we make constant progress in our project.
