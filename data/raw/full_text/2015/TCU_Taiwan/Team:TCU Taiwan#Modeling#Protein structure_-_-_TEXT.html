About our modeling
To increase efficiency in isolating our AMPs, we introduced a signal peptide upstream of the N-terminal of our AMPs. This signal peptide is obtained from chitinase C of S.lividans (MGFRHKAAALAATLALPLAGLVGLASPAQA). When the fusion peptides enter the periplasmic space, peptidase will identify the cleavage site Ala-Gln-Ala and cut at the double Ala between the signal and AMPs. To ensure and verify this process, we have attached an Ala at the N-terminal of AMPs. When applying a protein secondary structure prediction software base on the known peptide structure, we can analyze whether the attached Ala may have an effect on the peptide folding process.
Signiferin peptide structure analysis
The first column shows the amino acid sequence that we predict. The second column shows that AMPs corresponding secondary structure state are still a-helix.  The third column shows the probability of correct prediction.
Epinicedin-1 pepetide structure analysis
The first column shows the amino acid sequence that we predict. The second column shows that AMPs corresponding secondary structure state are still a-helix.  The third column shows the probability of correct prediction.
Conclusion
Through the analysis of the peptide secondary structure and confirmation of the -helix structure, the results show whether Ala is attached to Signiferin or Epinecidin-1, the peptide did not affect the peptide folding process. process.
