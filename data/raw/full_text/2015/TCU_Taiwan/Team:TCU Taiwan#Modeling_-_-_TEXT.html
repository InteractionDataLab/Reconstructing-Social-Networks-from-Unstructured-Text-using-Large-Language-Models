About our modeling
We had collected the data of disinfection experiments and in vitro wound healing assay. Than we analyzed it into charts to represent our experimental achievement.
Disinfection Efficiency
We had tested the disinfection ability of our AMPs and proved our system is really worked.First, we prepared 1 ml LB medium of S. aureus concentration of OD 0.01 at 600 nm. Than we added 1 ml sample into tube and measured the OD at 600 nm once in two hours.The experiments were carried out for 24 hours, and the result were collected at 0, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 24th hours. We had analyzed the data and made it into chart.
Conclusions: As the chart we can see that both Signiferin and Epinecidin-1 have ability to kill S. aureus. At 0 hour, there were no obvious differences between control and  experimental group. However, at 6th hours, inhibition of bacterial growth were  obvious in both signiferin and epi-1. But the effect is not significant. We speculated the concentration is not enough to see the best efficiency.
Modeling for cell experiments
After cell migration experiments, we use ImageJ to measure the distance of the migration then compared them to interpret our results. We had collected data and analyze it to made charts.
The Signiferin group with one ten dilution of crude extract
Fig. 1 The pictures of cell migration in the Signiferin group at 0 hour and 24 hours
Fig. 1-1 The percentage of migration distance between Signiferin group and mock
Conclusion: As Fig. 1 the Signiferin group with one ten dilution of crude extract, no significant differences of cell migration were observed. And we also compared with mock group (show as Fig. 1-1) there were no signify difference too. It means Signiferin doesn’t has ability to help wound healing.
The Epinecidin-1 group with one ten dilution of crude extract
Fig. 2 The pictures of cell migration in the Epinecidin-1 group at 0 hour and 24 hours
Fig. 2-1 The percentage of migration distance between Epinecidin-1 group and mock
Conclusion: In the Epinecidin-1 group significant efficiency of migration were observed in the picture in Fig. 2. And we also compared the migration distance between Epinecidin-1 group and mock group. As Fig. 2-1 shows, wound healing time was cut in half, in other words, if a wound needs 4 weeks to recovered, now only needs 2 weeks. These results consistent with previous publications.
The combinational AMPs group using 1 in 500 dilution of crude extract
Fig. 3 The pictures of cell migration in the combinational AMPs group at 0 hour and 24 hours
Fig. 3-1 The percentage of migration distance between combinational AMPs group and mock
Conclusion: In the combinational AMPs group using 1 in 500 dilution of crude extract, synergetic effects were observed in the picture Fig.3 and also showed in the chart Fig. 3-1. That means, a wound used to recovered in 2 weeks, now we just need one. The patients suffering will be much lessen.
