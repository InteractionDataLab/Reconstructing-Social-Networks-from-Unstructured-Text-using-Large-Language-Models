To indirect prove wound healing, we perform experiments in cell migration. Two cells are selected for the experiment: Squamous keratinocyte called HaCat. To make the result closer to human, both cells were sampled from human cells. Squamous keratinocyt cell shows the influence of our peptides on epithelial. On other hand, because angiogenesis is one of the indicators of wound healing, Dermal microvascular endothelium cell is selected here. In cell migration experiment, samples are divided into following groups:1. Mock2. pQE-60 has no insert and no IPTG induction of LB medium for 200 l  (Control 1)3. pQE-60 has insert, without IPTG induction of LB medium for 200 l (Control 2)4. pQE-60 has no insert, with IPTG induction of LB medium for 200 l (Control 3)5. 1l AMPs 6. 5l AMPs7. 100l AMPs8. 200l AMPsFurthermore, all of above groups are divided into three more groups: Epinecidin-1, Signiferin, Epinecidin-1 and Signiferin.
In Epinecidin-1, concentration of 1ul, we can see the most significant effectiveness.
In Signiferin, concentration of 50l, we can see the most significant effectiveness.
In Epinecidin-1 and Signiferin, concentration of 1l, we can see the most significant effectiveness.
After cell migration experiment, To interpret our result, we use ImageJ to distance measurement and compare them.
