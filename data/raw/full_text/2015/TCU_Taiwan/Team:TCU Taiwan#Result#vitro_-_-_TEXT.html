signiferin
Aug. 6th ,2015
•  We did PCR of signiferin. After doing gel electrophoresis to make sure the size, we did gel extraction, ligated the PCR product into TA clone, transformed it into competent cell, and culture it.
2% gel. The PCR product of signiferin should be 100~200 bp. As the result, there is band between 100~200 bp on sample 2 so we consider it is correct.
Aug. 15th ,2015
• We purified the plasmid of TA clone with signiferin, and did gel electrophoresis to make sure the size.
0.8% gel. The size of TA plasmid with signiferin insert should be 2000~3000 bp. In addition, plasmid will become sorpercoil so it will run faster. Therefore, we consider these are the correct plasmids.
Aug. 16th ,2015
• We used BamHI and NcoI these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in TA clone. After doing gel electrophoresis to make sure the size, we did gel extraction, ligated it into backbone, transformed into competent cell, and culture it.
2% gel. The size of signiferin insert should be 100~200 bp. In addition, the signiferin insert in biobrick should be a little bigger than in pQE60. As the result, these two are all the correct sample we need.
Aug. 21st ,2015
• We pureified the plasmid of pQE60 with signiferin, and did gel electrophoresis to make sure the size.
0.8% gel. The size of our plasmid should be 3000 to 4000. As the result, these samples are the plasmid we need.
Sep 11st ,2015
• Finally, we used Nco I and BamH I these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in the pQE60 plasmid.
We ran 2% gel. The size of signiferin should be 100~200 bp. As the result, there all have bands on each samples.
Epinecidin-1
Aug. 21st ,2015
• We did PCR of Epinecidin-1. After doing gel electrophoresis to make sure the size, we did gel extraction, ligated the PCR product into TA clone, transformed it into competent cell, and culture it.
2％ gel. It is the correct size that Epi-1 PCR product have band between 200~300 bp. But, there is also band on blank. We consider it was polluted when we add reagent.
Aug. 26th ,2015
• We purified the plasmid of TA clone with Epinecidin-1, and did gel electrophoresis to make sure the size.
0.8% gel. The size of TA plasmid with Epinecidin-1 insert should be 2000~3000 bp. In addition, plasmid will become sorpercoil so it will run faster. Therefore, we consider these are the correct plasmids.
Aug. 28th ,2015
• We used BamH I and BglII these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in TA clone. After doing gel electrophoresis to make sure the size, we did gel extraction, ligated it into backbone, transformed into competent cell, and culture it.

• We pureified the plasmid of pQE60 with Epinecidi-1, and did gel electrophoresis to make sure the size.
0.8% gel. The size of our plasmid should be 3000 to 4000. As the result, these samples are the plasmid we need.
Sep 12rd ,2015
• Finally, we used BamHI and BglII these two kinds of enzyme to check the insert really contain in the pQE60 plasmid.
We used Nco I and BamH I to do enzyme digestion and ran 2% gel. The size of signiferin should be 100~200 bp. As the result, there all have bands on each samples.
