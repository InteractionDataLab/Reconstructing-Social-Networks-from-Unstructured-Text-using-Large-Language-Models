ONE DAY WORKSHOP
Session
Date: July 11, 2015
Venue: LB 4, Library Extension, the University of Hong Kong
Target: 25 F.5 students (Grade 11) from 5 different school
BACKGROUND
School Visit allows primary school students build up a basic concept towards synthetic biology. However, is it enough for Human Practice to come to the end? No. The “transmission” of synthetic biological message to high school students would be another concern because it is the stage when students start to think about what to study in university. Thus, we held a one-day workshop for high school students to develop a more in-depth sense of synthetic biology among them.

Reflection
“The banana DNA extraction is very interesting, but the talks about genetic engineering is quite confusing...”
“The materials are very detailed...but I feel that the schedule is rather packed for there is no break in between sessions...”
“Writing keys notes on the blackboard when presenting the PowerPoint allows us to know better about the messages… However, to be honest, the discussion session is quite boring. It might be better if the arrangement can be clearer next time...”
