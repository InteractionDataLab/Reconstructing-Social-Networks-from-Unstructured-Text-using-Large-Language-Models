3. PCR was performed but running gel was failed due to human error so 2 pieces of new 1% agarose gel were prepared and PCR was done again overnight.
28 AUG 2015
1. To check whether GFP (27 kDa) was expressed in BBa_K577881 when the BioBrick was induced with 0.2% arabinose,
- SDS-PAGE was performed using Pageruler sm0671 as the marker → Results: a thick band of about 25 kDa after staining with Coomassie blue
- Western blot was performed using Pageruler sm0671 as the marker → Negative results

1. Running gel was performed to confirm the PCR products that gBlock 1, 3, 4 and 5 showed correct band size despite of non-specific cuts. gBlock 2 still showed wrong band size.
2. PCR (Tm-5) was done again and after running the gel, gBlock 1 and 5 were fine with expected band size while the expected bands of gBlock 3 and 4 were too vague to be seen. And gBlock 2 was still problematic about its band size.
3. To detect GFP signal expressed by BBa_K577881 in DH10B induced by 0.2% arabinose,
- by using plate reader Varioskan Flash, the result was unreliable as the maximum RFU was at 501 nm and 511 nm for the well containing BBa_K577881 overnight culture with arabinose as well as the one with PBS alone
- by using confocal microscope, GFP could be seen from the BBa_K577881 overnight culture with arabinose
- from the plate streaked on 28 Aug, green fluorescence could be spotted under UV box
4. 1 colony was picked from each BBa_K577881 plate transformed into DH10B on 20 Aug and BL21(DE3) on 12 Aug, the collected colonies were incubated overnight at 37 degree Celsius.
5. 2 new CM30 plates were streaked with BBa_K577881 in DH10B and BL21(DE3) induced by 0.2% arabinose to check for GFP expression.
01 SEP 2015
1. PCR was performed and its products were confirmed after running the gel. gBlock 1, 3, 4  and 5 were fine with the band size but gBlock 4 was somehow vague to be seen under UV. gBLock 2 showed wrong band size.
2. Gel extraction for purifying gBlock 1, 3 and 5 was failed due to human error.
3. Since gBlock 2 failed every time, the original fragment was tested by running gel. Yet no bands could be seen in the gel photo. 2-step PCR was performed for gBlock 2 and 4.
4. 1-hour arabinose induction was performed for GFP expression by BBa_K577881.
02 SEP 2015
1. The PCR products were confirmed after running the gel that gBlock 2 still showed wrong band size while gBlock 4 was invisible in gel photo.
2. PCR was performed for gBlock 1, 2, 3 and 4, but this time with DMSO added to eliminate any possible secondary structures that may account for gBlock amplification failure. The products were confirmed from the gel that only gBlock 2 showed wrong band size.
3. Gel extraction was performed to purify gBlock 1, 3, and 4. The concentration was measured by Nanodrop 2000,
gBlock 1
19.5 ng/uL
gBlock 3
23.8 ng/uL
gBlock 4
8.7 ng/uL
4. gBlock 2 original fragment was tested by running agarose gel to see if it is defective but there was a very thin band of the correct band size.
5. The GFP test performed on 1 Sep was on-going overnight and the GFP was measured by using PerkinElmer Multimode Plate Reader. It showed that RFU generally increased with arabinose concentration and time. Also, the expression of BBa_K577881 was better in DH10B than in BL21(DE3).
04 SEP 2015
1. PCR was performed for gBlock 2 with DMSO added. This time we had tried 2 Ta for the 30-second annealing step. However the 1kb+ ladder and gBlock bands were unclear due to syBRsafe lost during gel piece handling.
2. All gBlock original fragments were tested by running agarose gel. Only gBlock 1, gBlock 3 and gBlock 5 showed expected bands while gBlock 2 still came up with a band of 600 bp and gBlock 4 went invisible.
3. gBlock 2 and gBlock 4 original fragments were tested again by running the agarose gel but no bands were found for both gBlocks.

Week 12
07 SEP 2015
1. gBlock 2 original fragment was tested by running agarose gel but still no bands were observed.
2. HiFi assembly was performed to assemble all 5 gBlocks (PCR products of each gBlock, except gBlock 2 which we used its stock) with the backbone pSB1C3, along with a positive control. Both products were transformed into DH10B competent cells on CM30 plates with 10 uL of 20% arabinose stock and 10 uL of 0.1% tryptophan stock added.
08 SEP 2015
1. Transformation results of HiFi products with the positive control were confirmed that only the positive control showed >30 colonies while HiFi product transformation failed even with arabinose and tryptophan added.
2. HiFi products were tested by running agarose gel and several bands instead of one single band were observed.
3. Using the same HiFi products, transformation into DH10B competent cells was performed again under the same setting but this time 0.02% arabinose and 0.001% tryptophan were added during the recovery step.
4. The PCR product of gBlock 4 was amplified by PCR and the products were stored overnight at 4 degree Celsius.
09 SEP 2015
1. Second transformation results of HiFi products were confirmed that 14 small pink colonies were found.
2. The PCR gBlock 4 overnight products were collected and tested by running agarose gel but no bands were observed.
3. PCR was performed for gBlock 2 but this time we used Taq polymerase with dNTPs. Ta 53.9 degree Celsius was used for the 30-second annealing step. Yet, no bands were observed after running the product on an agarose gel.
4. HiFi assembly was performed again but this time we used the stock of both gBlock 2 and gBlock 4 with the PCR products of gBlock 1, gBlock 3 and gBlock 5 and pSB1C3. The HiFi product was transformed into Dh10B competent cells with 0.02% arabinose and 0.001% tryptophan added on a CM30 plate.
5. 8 colonies were picked from the CM30 plate with HiFi product in DH10B and incubated in  LB-Ara-Trp-CM30 overnight.
10 SEP 2015
1. Third transformation results of HiFi products were confirmed that no colonies were found.
2. The HiFi products from second transformation were miniprepped.
11 SEP 2015
1. The concentration of the miniprepped HiFi products was measured by using Nanodrop 2000.
HiFi product (1)
190.5 ng/uL
HiFi product (2)
202.8 ng/uL
HiFi product (3)
224.8 ng/uL
HiFi product (4)
211.4 ng/uL
HiFi product (5)
233.1 ng/uL
HiFi product (6)
227.7 ng/uL
HiFi product (7)
231.8 ng/uL
HiFi product (8)
256.5 ng/uL
2. All miniprepped HiFi products were tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel. But each product showed 2 bands of 2000 bp and 3000 bp instead of just a single band of around 9000 bp.
3. 2-step PCR was performed using Taq polymerase to amplify both gBlock 2 and the whole construct from the miniprep HiFi product (8).

14 SEP 2015
1. The 2-step PCR products were tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel. However, the band sizes of both gBlock 2 and the whole construct were wrong though they showed similar bands.
2. New gBlock 2 had arrived and resuspension with TE buffer was done so that the final concentration became 10 ng/uL. The fragment was then tested by running a 0.7% agarose gel but the band was invisible due to the low concentration of gBlock 2 in the well.
3. PCR was performed to amplify the new gBlock 2 using Q5 polymerase. 2 temperatures were used for the 30-second annealing step: 59.9 degree Celsius and 61.5 degree Celsius.
