PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
1. Prepare the gBlock DNA template for a 50 uL reaction. Add 1uL of 10 ng/uL gBlock DNA to 9 uL of PCR water to make up the concentration as 1 ng/uL. 1 ng of DNA template is enough.
2. Add (n mole/10) mL of TE buffer to each oligonucleotide primer to make up the concentration as 10 uM. A final concentration of 0.5 uM in the reaction would show the best result.
3. Assemble all reaction components on ice. Gently mix all the components before use. Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary.
