ABOUT LAB AND HKU
We are the undergraduate team from the University of Hong Kong. Established in 1992, The University of Hong Kong is the oldest institute of higher learning in Hong Kong. Built nearby the sea, the medical campus has a different location from HKU main campus, and is where the LKS Faculty of Medicine locates.
During the project, we use the teaching lab from School of Biomedical Sciences, LKS Faculty of Medicine to carry out most of our experiment. We also used the research lab of the Biochemisty Department for the procedures that requires advances machines and apparatuses.
