HUMAN PRACTICE
Introduction
Human Practice is, as mentioned in the iGEM official webpage, a crucial element in the project that requires students to question about the relationship between our livelihood and synthetic biology. This year, the Hong Kong_HKU Team would like to pay its focus on education and ethical issues regarding to the synthetic biological technology, which are frequently discussed in Hong Kong nowadays. Therefore, the team held a series of events, including School Visits, One-Day Workshop, and Brochures delivery in summer to share more knowledge with the general public about this topic.
