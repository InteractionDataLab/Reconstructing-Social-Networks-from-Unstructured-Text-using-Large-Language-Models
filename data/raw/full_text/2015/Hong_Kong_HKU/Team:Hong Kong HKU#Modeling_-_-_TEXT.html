Module 1
1.1) Transcription rate of AraC, assuming the diffusion rate of arabinose across the cell is constant
1.2) Transcription rate of CI repressor; pBAD as positive inducible promoter
1.3) Transcription rate of Cas protein
Module 2
2.1) Transcription rate of trpR, assuming the diffusion rate of tryptophan across the cell is constant
