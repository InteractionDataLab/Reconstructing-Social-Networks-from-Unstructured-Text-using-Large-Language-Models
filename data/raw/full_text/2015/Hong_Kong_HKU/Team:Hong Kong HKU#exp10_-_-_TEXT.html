OUR PROJECT TITLE
Project Description
The development of synthetic biology aroused the concerns of biosafety problems due to the great editing and recreation of genome, resulting in the difficulty predicting the behavior of synthetic organism. Accidental spreading of synthetic organism may pose a threat to our environment. In the past few years, several iGEM teams has discussed and reported the need               for a standard safety cassette for synthetic biology. Our teammates viewed this as an important issue. Some past teams also focused on this topic, such as xx using DNase e.t.c. We would like to design a better circuit, which is highly regulated and cheaper control to suit the goal.
This summer we investigated the innate function of CRISPR Cas systems in prokaryotes and               tried to apply its cleavage for the purpose of biosafety. In our project we design and engineer a               biological circuit called killing switch, which can perform destruction of DNA when the genetic               modified organisms leave the required conditions, and then transfer the system into ''E. coli''.
