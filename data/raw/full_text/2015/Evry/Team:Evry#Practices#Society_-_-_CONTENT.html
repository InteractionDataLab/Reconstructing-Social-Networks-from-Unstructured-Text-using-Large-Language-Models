The two surveys presented after have been publishing online as one. This survey aims to understand the acceptability of our treatment by people and in a second time the donor behaviors.  We collected 220 answers which allowed us to do statistics. The anonymity of persons asked has been preserved, just as well the representative of each socio-professional category in the French population. Unfortunately retired person, farmers and Storekeeper are missing. The answers have been analyzed in accordance with the following questions and our population sample has been characterized:  
</P><UL><LI>- How old are you?</LI><LI>- What is your socio-professional category (definite by INSEE)?
</LI><LI>- Students</LI><LI>- Farmers</LI><LI>- Artisans, storekeepers, managers</LI><LI>- Executives, intellectual professions</LI><LI>- Administrative workers, technicians, and associate profesionnals</LI><LI>- Employee</LI><LI>- Laborer</LI><LI>- Retired person</LI><LI>- Other person without activity</LI></UL><LI>- How many people live in your household?</LI><LI>- What is your household monthly income?</LI><P class="text-justify">

This survey aims to understand the perception and the acceptability of our treatment by people. The two question following are extracted of a bigger survey including the second survey analyze after.  
</P><P class="text-justify">
Does customized therapy for cancer based on living yeast injection seem acceptable and ethical for you?
</P><P class="text-justify">
Have you or someone close to you been affected by cancer?
</P><P class="text-justify">
This study has shown no relation between this accept or reject our treatment and the fact to be affected directly or closely.  In the same way no relation was found with the age, the household budget or socio-professional category. The results attest that our therapy will be accepted by patient with 93.4%. 
</P><P class="text-justify">
Would you donate for clinical trial? 
</P>
If so, would it be an occasional or a monthly donation? 
<P class="text-justify">
The occasional donators give 135.6€ in average and the monthly donators give 15€ per months whether 180€ per year.
</P><P class="text-justify">
What kind of donation would be the most suitable for you? (one or several possible choices) 
</P><P class="text-justify">
Which measure would convince you to contribute financially? (one or several possible choices)
</P><P class="text-justify">
The Autre/other category regroup: a crush on the project, concerned by the aim, and to know a person in the project. To go further, we have been realized a multivariate analyze. 
</P><P class="text-justify">
The <STRONG>2/3 of the people surveyed would agree to donate</STRONG>, this number is promising, and higher than the national average 48% (National institut for statistics and economical study INSEE). The study of the non donor case highlight five reasons: not enough money for the student, a fear of scam, they don’t trust in the platform or pharmaceutical compagnies system,  are no concerned at all or not for this kind of project, finally 30% think that it is the role of the state to finance the clinical trial. For the people afraid a adapted communication could change their position. </P><P class="text-justify">
Among the 2/3 of donators <STRONG>only 7% are monthly donator</STRONG>, yet this kind is appreciate to plan a budget, and so is an important axis to improve. A trend emerging among the results: the amount depend  of the socio professional categories and the household income, as we have supposed. Indeed, The exuctives and intellectual professions are a priveleged public to raise found for two reasons, they give more than the other socio-professional category and 11% are monthly donators. It is important to highlight that all the socio-professionnal category are potential donators, and have to be incorporated in global strategy. We could imagine a certified label creation to improve the donor visibility and reassure them or to go further, the creation of advisor specializes in this kind of investments.</P><P class="text-justify">
The <STRONG>essence of the project</STRONG> is the <STRONG>key to convince people</STRONG>, the results show that achieved results 66,2%, and knowing the purpose 81,2% are essential.  The response of “other choice” give some lever to improve communication and reach even more people the idea to have a crush was cited several times, as well as a subject “dear to my heart”, and finally to know somebody in the team.  Surprinsingly, people prefer the simple donation (70,4%), following by the donation with goodies (29.2%), and  the equity (investment in the company) and finally the bank loan (21,3%).  We can imagine to develop three funding kind in back. Regarding to the simple donation the effort would to increase monthly proportion donors and no the simple donation itself. To conclude this survey show that people are interesting to be actor of the scientific research, the communication and the clearness of the project is inescapable reach people. </P><P class="text-justify lead">
“70.5% of the people surveyed are affected themselves or someone closer by cancer”

Therapies cancer vaccines are a heterogeneous group of complex biologics with distinctly different clinical characteristics than cytotoxic agents. The number cited confirms the importance of this disease in the society. In litterature, we found that men have a little less than a 1 in 2 lifetime risk of developing cancer, and for women, the risk is a little more than 1 in 3, and represent 1.6 million new cancer cases diagnosed. The drug and treatment are tested on a large population sample and allow used statistical average, but to obtain these results the patient genetic makeup is lost.  Consequently, the large public therapies are often imprecise, unpredictable and ineffective due to an adaptability need. In this context, personalized therapies bring by our project make sense. The benefits of an unique treatment for patient are: 
<UL><LI>- Shifting the emphasis in medicine from reaction to prevention</LI><LI>- Predicting susceptibility to disease</LI><LI>- Improved disease detection</LI><LI>- Preempting disease progression</LI><LI>- Customized disease-prevention strategies</LI><LI>- Prescribing more effective drugs</LI><LI>- Avoiding prescribing drugs with predictable side effects</LI><LI>- Reduced time, cost, and failure rate of pharmaceutical clinical trials</LI></UL></P><P class="text-justify">
To go further, breakthrough therapy is eligible for all of the Fast Track provisions, intensive Food and drug administration (FDA) guidance on an efficient drug development program. To conclude, the survey showed the French society is open to our therapies.  The survey gets rid of levers to improve our strategies to collect money and keep going our project.
