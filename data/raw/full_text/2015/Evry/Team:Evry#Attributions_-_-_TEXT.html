The team
Our iGEM team is composed of 7 motivated Master's students from the University of Evry Val d'Essonne, Paris Diderot University and AgroParisTech engineering school, coming from various fields: molecular biology, synthetic biology, computational biology and biotechnology.
To learn more about our team, feel free to take a look at the team members page!
Lab work
The wet lab work is taking place in the institute of Synthetic and Systemic Biology (more information below).
Louise Barreau, Clément de Obaldia, Pierre-Yves Nogue, Frédéric Ros and Marjorie Aubert were working on the bench.
They were advised by Cyrille Pauthenier and Julie Zaworski who gave them tips on cloning strategies when working with S. cerevisiae. Bruno Colombo is also helping by teaching them mammalian cell culture.
Bioinformatics
Work on computational immunology was done by Emilia Puig Lombardi and François Bucchini. They were advised by Costas Bouyioukos, member of the institute.
Human Pratices
Lucie Raymond conducted the interviews. Marjorie Aubert and Louise Barreau did the rest of the work on hte human practices.
Wiki
Every member of the team was involved in the wiki, giving advices and ideas for the content and layout. Coding and webdesign of the wiki was done by François Bucchini.
The Institute of Synthetic and Systemic Biology
The Institute of Synthetic and Systemic Biology (iSSB) was hosting our team. It is part of both the University of Evry Val d'Essonne and the CNRS,     and is located on the Genopole® biocluster . It is a multidisciplinary laboratory where physicists, chemists, computer scientists and molecular biologists are working together.
The institute also started the first European Master in Systems & Synthetic Biology (mSSB), which several members of our team are from.
