iGEM TU Eindhoven: cloning guide
Our team participated in the writing of a cloning guide aiming at centralizing information regarding different cloning techniques. This project was initiated and carried by the TU Eindhoven iGEM team.
As we worked using the Golden Gate assembly method during the competition, we wrote half of the part of the guide dedicated to it (along with the NRP-UEA iGEM team who wrote the other half).
Learn more about the cloning guide here (iGEM TU Eindhoven wiki).
