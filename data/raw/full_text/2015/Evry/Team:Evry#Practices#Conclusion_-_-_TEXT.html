Conclusion
We conducted this Human practice project as a conclusion of our work and what it could become outside of our team and could represent for other people.
The survey was an interesting tool to explore the society perception and has shown a high acceptability of the treatment we engineered. Plus, this survey aims to understand donator behavior and optimize a fund collect strategy. Interviews allowed discovering the crowdfunding domain. Our objective is to replace our project in the society and a company point of view: innovate and develop.
Human practice is a key to appreciate and to project this work in an economical, philosophical and ethical point of view.  This study reinforced the idea that our therapy could find its place in todayâ€™s treatment landscape.
