Strains used was yeast W303 auxotroph for URA, TRP, HIS, LEU and ADE. A complemented media without amino-acids was used to select and maintain the recombinant yeasts. Yeast was grown to exponential mid-log phase for 12 hours, then resuspended in galactose media for 30h of induction at 25°C. In some experiments, yeast was pre-fixed in 0.5 % paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes followed by washing in PBS before DC loading.

The T cell hybridoma cell line, B3Z, specific for the OVA 257-264 peptide (SIINFEKL) in the context of Kb, was a gift from the Curie Institute (Paris V). B3Z were maintained in a medium (RP-10) consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, Glutamax, HEPES,  50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

- For surface display staining with HA-tag-680 label, yeasts were grown at 30°C with 300 r.p.m. agitation in SC-auxotrophic complemented media. 
- When culture reached mid-exponential phase, cells were harvested and fixed with paraformaldehyde with the following protocol : 1 mL sample was cooled to an ice water-bath and centrifuged at 4°, 2000g for 2 min. 
- Antibodies were added during 30 minutes, then the cells were washed with PBS. Supernatant was removed and pellet was resuspended in 200 uL of 0.5 % paraformaldehyde. - The mix was incubated on ice for 30 minutes and subsequently centrifuged at 4°C, 2000g for 2 minutes.
