Nianhui Zhang
It is my pleasure to see the growth of the students full of energy and vitality.
Wei Wei
Synthetic biology has a large potential to create our life,and I’d like to join this amazing area and share different idea and advice in the big family.
Chuanfang Wu
IGEM is a valuable, insightful and rewarding educational experience. It’s really a great honor for me to be a team member of SCU-China.I hope everyone could enjoy it.
Our Team Members
Nan Wang
I want to be the one who can tell the difference between Pepsi and coke. It is not joke but the respect to characterize some abstract feeling with physical data.
Nannan Xie
Nannan Xie,leader of Nitrogen fixation group. As a junior majoring in biotechnology, I am participating in the project and expriments all this summer. I designed our exprimental scheme and carried it on with my teammates.
Shiji Zhao
I major in biological science and I will be a junior after this summer.  iGEM plays a critical role in my school life since I was a freshman. Thanks for the platform given by MIT for communicating with iGEMers all over the world!
Zhisheng Liang
I mainly worked in nitrogen fixation group, and perfected the whole experiment process with other two members. As a member in this excellent team, through communicating with other team members and autonomous learning, I learned a lot of knowledge about experiments and experimental design. My molecular experiment operation was gradually skilled.
Yulong Tang
This is second year for me in our team. This year, I take the charge of carbon fixation group. The iGEM is a perfect opportunity for me to challenge myself and get honor for our school. Above all, I love biology, I love iGEM.
Haoyu Wang
I mainly worked in nitrogen fixation group, and perfected the whole experiment process with other two members. As a member in this excellent team, through communicating with other team members and autonomous learning, I learned a lot of knowledge about experiments and experimental design. My molecular experiment operation was gradually skilled.
Zhilong Zhang
I am not a newcomer for iGEM.Last year I have joined our team.After this summer I will be a junior.This time my work is experiment of carbon fixation group and webpage making.I enjoy team working and discussing with others.It helps me a lot and I really get many happy.
Zekun Lv
Junior student in Sichuan University, and majors in biology, has been staying in SCU-China igem team for two years from 2013. I’m good at drawing and biologic modeling. So in this years, I accept an assignment about arts and modeling parts. I’m interested in bio-information and synthetic biology. In my point, synthetic biology is not only a science which can make kinds of gene modeling, but also a technology to put biologic research into production greatly. Finally, wish we get a good grades in this game.
Yu Luo
This is the second year that I anticipated in iGEM. As one of the group leaders in our team, I mainly designed and did the verification experiment of the composite promoter, as well as the regulation parts of our project.
Shaobo Yang
This is the second year that I anticipated in iGEM. As one of the group leaders in our team, I mainly designed and did the verification experiment of the composite promoter, as well as the regulation parts of our project.
Hongbin Yu
Member of Regulation Team & Art Design Team, Banner Designer As a freshman, it's honored to get involved in our project this year. I do appreciate the knowledge I learned these days and treasure the time we spent with. Special thanks to seniors who always forgive my mistakes and correct me. I really enjoy this journey with you guys!
Ruifeng Wu
I am in charge of the Human Practice in our team, and paint some material for wiki, poster and banner. I am good at both painting and tennis. Traveling and observing wild animals also are my interests. With an optimistic attitude and an open mind, I  have many like-minded friends and hope to make more friends around the world.
Yuanfang Huang
Modeling and experiment. It really is my privilege to be engaged in such an interesting competition with a group of creative and brilliant teammates. All of these made this summer a special one.
Fangfang Lu
I am a junior in the School of Life Sciences. I worked on purifying two useful proteins for another part and did some other experiments in this project. In this summer, I also participated in team communication and developed a card game related to synthetic-biology experiments.In this team, I got many excellent ideas from other members.
Pumiao Yan
As the only team member majoring in electrical engineering, I mainly work on the simulation of the project and part of the translation. I contributed largely in proposing the task of the year, while I also worked in the radio station to help introducing iGEM and synthetic biology through “Chocolate Martini”, a radio program I hosted in SCU Foreign Language Radio Station.
Lingxiao Yang
I am cheerful, modest, self-confident and good at communicating with others.I have strong endurance, willpower and hard-working quality of the work to identify persistent optimism, the courage to face difficulties and challenges. At the same time, I have taken an active part in all kinds of activities in order to improve my personal qualities. All because I believe being good is must; successful, however, is plus.
Reserve Team Member in the Future:
Shengze Xie
My name is Shengze Xie, studying in Sichuan University, responsible for the work of Human Practice in SCU_CHINA this year. Meanwhile, I became the lead singer and actor in our video "Ordinary E.Coli". I hope iGEM can make our world more advanced and brighter.
Jie Ren
My name is Jie Ren. In this year ,I did some work about modeling and human practice.
Ge Jin
JIN Ge is a freshman in the School of Life Sciences,Sichuan University. He worked on biosafety and served the team as a photographer.He loves microorganism and interests in synthetic biology.During his spare time,he often practices in some microbiology laboratory to improve his skills.
Mengwei Liao
As a major in material science, always pay all attention to the nature. I'd like to explore the world.Because of iGEM, I meet so many friends and learn so many things that I will never learn from the lesson in ordinary school life.
Bin Liu
I am from colloge of Life Science ，Sichuan University,and my name is Bin Liu. I am interested in biology,    and I am very fun to be in the laboratory. Besides this, I love playing basketball and often play it in my spare time. I also Intereste in calligraphy .
Minji Ai
I am a junior in sichuan university and my major is biotechnology. I work on human practice group, and I help to make up plans and buying stuff. Making sure all the activities works well is an interesting job. I am a girl who is into the neuro science in particularly. And out the lab, I enjoy driving cars and riding bikes.
Yiwen Zhao
My name is Yiwen Zhao, a student of SCU China. I enormously prefer biology and persue my dream as a scientist in cell or Epigenetic field. As for my hobby, I'd like to play pingpang and do some reading in my spare time.If you want to travel in China, I'm glad to show you around in my hometown.
Shimeng Li
Science and art,which occupy all of my life,lead to me the life of desire.Despite the fact that I can not help our team as much as others in laboratory for the limit of my major,nevertheless I still appreciate every effort I paid with everybody.Science,a cool thing!
