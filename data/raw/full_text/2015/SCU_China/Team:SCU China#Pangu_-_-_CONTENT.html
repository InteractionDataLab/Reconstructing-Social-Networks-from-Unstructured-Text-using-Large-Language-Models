After about 18,000 years, a giant called Pangu emerged within it. He separated the chaos with his ax. Elements which were light and clean floated up to form the Sky; elements which were heavy and turbid went down to form the Earth. But the sky and earth were still easily mixed up. To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. With each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet thicker, and Pangu ten feet taller. It took about another 18,000 years for Pangu to grow to an extreme height. During this period the sky became extremely high and the earth extremely thick.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>垂死化身，气成风云，声为雷霆，左眼为日，右眼为月，四肢五体为四极五岳，血液为江河，筋脉为地理，肌肉为田土，发髭为星辰，皮毛为草木，齿骨为金石，精髓为珠玉，汗流为雨泽，身之诸虫因风所感，化为黎甿。</P><FOOTER>《五运历年记》</FOOTER></BLOCKQUOTE><P>After Pangu’s death, his breath became the wind, mist and clouds; his voice made thunder; his two eyes shined as the sun and moon; his head made up the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood turned into rivers; his muscles made fertile land; his facial hair transformed into the stars and Milky Way; his fur became bushes and forests; his bones formed valuable minerals; his bone marrow hid in earth as sacred diamonds; his sweat formed rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became animals.</P><P><STRONG>In Chinese mythology, Pangu is the creator of universe. It reflected the curiosity of ancient Chinese towards the origin of our world.</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>In the future, if life successfully colonize the Mars, will they also wonder the origin of their world?</STRONG></P></SECTION></ARTICLE></MAIN></DIV></DIV></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
