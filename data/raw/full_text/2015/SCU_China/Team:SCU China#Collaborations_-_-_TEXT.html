University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
This year we continued our cooperation with University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. We helped their team with the cryostat section process, and they returned the favor helping us acquiring RBS sequences and analyzing them.
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
We maintained close cooperation with XJTLU-CHINA team since November 2014.Experiences on how our team run the team and recruit were shared and instructions were given to XJTLU-CHINA team. We also noticed them some problems that might trouble them and some important things that they should pay close attention to. Specific document was made to help instruct them when using the iGEM website, including how to search and acquire bio-bricks. Considering the circumstances they were in, we gave our personal advice and answers to their question without reservation.
