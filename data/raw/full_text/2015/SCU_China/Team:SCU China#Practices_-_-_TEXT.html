Human Practices
This year we tried to explore many new ways to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM as well as our project. Therefore we focused on multimedia advertising and active interaction with other Asian groups.
ACMA
2015.4.27-2015.6.14
Synthetic biology as a fairly young branch of biology is still foreign to the majority of Sichuan university, we started a contest named ACMA, short for Sichuan University-Architects Competition of Microorganism Application.
This contest aimed at introducing the area of synthetic biology to more students. Students were requested to hand in their own idea of a project. They were ranked by the innovation and feasibility of their idea, and the student who ranked first won the fund to realize his or her own project.
The school started introductory lectures on synthetic biology, and successfully invited students from fifteen schools to take part in the contest, including Electrical engineering, Medical school, Business school and so on.
We also built an information platform on Wechat, informing students with notices about the contest and some fun facts relating to biology.
An interview about synthetic biology
Chocolate Martini
Episode on May 19th
Radio Program of Foreign Language Radio Station of Sichuan University
This year our team was invited to a radio program called Chocolate Martini of Foreign Language Radio Station of Sichuan University to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM. We mainly focused on biosafety because it is so important for both we biological researchers and the public. This program was broadcasted by the radio station of Sichuan University and enhanced public awareness of synthetic biology and biosafety.
