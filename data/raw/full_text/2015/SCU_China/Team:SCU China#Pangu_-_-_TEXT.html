At dawn of time, the universe was like a gigantic egg and there was nothing but chaos.
Pangu separated the chaos with his ax.  His two eyes shined as the sun and moon.
His blood turned into rivers; his muscles made fertile land; his facial hair transformed into the stars and Milky Way; his fur became bushes and forests.
Elements which were light and clean floated up to form the Sky; elements which were heavy and turbid went down to form the Earth.

The Story of Pangu in Chinese Mythology
天地混沌如鸡子，盘古生其中。万八千岁，天地开辟，阳清为天，阴浊为地。盘古在其中，一日九变，神于天，圣于地。天日高一丈，地日厚一丈，盘古日长一丈。如此万八千岁，天数极高，地数极深，盘古极长。
《三五历记》
At dawn of time, the universe was like a gigantic egg and there was nothing but chaos. After about 18,000 years, a giant called Pangu emerged within it. He separated the chaos with his ax. Elements which were light and clean floated up to form the Sky; elements which were heavy and turbid went down to form the Earth. But the sky and earth were still easily mixed up. To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. With each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet thicker, and Pangu ten feet taller. It took about another 18,000 years for Pangu to grow to an extreme height. During this period the sky became extremely high and the earth extremely thick.
垂死化身，气成风云，声为雷霆，左眼为日，右眼为月，四肢五体为四极五岳，血液为江河，筋脉为地理，肌肉为田土，发髭为星辰，皮毛为草木，齿骨为金石，精髓为珠玉，汗流为雨泽，身之诸虫因风所感，化为黎甿。
《五运历年记》
After Pangu’s death, his breath became the wind, mist and clouds; his voice made thunder; his two eyes shined as the sun and moon; his head made up the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood turned into rivers; his muscles made fertile land; his facial hair transformed into the stars and Milky Way; his fur became bushes and forests; his bones formed valuable minerals; his bone marrow hid in earth as sacred diamonds; his sweat formed rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became animals.
In Chinese mythology, Pangu is the creator of universe. It reflected the curiosity of ancient Chinese towards the origin of our world.
In the future, if life successfully colonize the Mars, will they also wonder the origin of their world?
