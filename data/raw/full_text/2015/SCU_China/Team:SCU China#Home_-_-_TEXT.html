E. pangu : The Pangu of Mars
The discovery of Kepler-452b calls public attention to space immigration again. As a matter of fact, the immigration to Mars, the most earthlike planet in solar system, still should be considered as priority. It is noticeable that CO2 and N2 account for  almost 98% of Martian atmosphere. Thus, we engineered two types of E.coli, which carry out anaerobic carbon fixation with ACS/CODH system, and nitrogen fixation with Paenibacillus nitrogenase respectively. We hope our E. pangu will play the role as pioneer organism in Mars immigration. Based on this purpose, we call them E. pangu collectively, which is named after the creator of universe, Pangu in Chinese mythology. In addition, we've introduced CRISPR-Cas 9 technique to verify our carbon fixation system, and we verified a promoter part we submitted last year.
