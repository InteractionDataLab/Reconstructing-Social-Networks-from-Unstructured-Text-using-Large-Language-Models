Bronze
We have registered to the iGEM 2015 Jamboree.
We have completed and submitted iGEM 2015 Judging form.
We have created and shared our team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have made a poster and planed our presentation for the iGEM Jamboree.
We have created a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
We have documented standard BioBrick Parts BBa_K1796002-BBa_K1796014,BBa_K1796101-BBa_K1796115,BBa_K1796201-BBa_K1796207 .

We have experimentally validated new BioBrick Part BBa_K1796001
We have submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We have hosted Architects Competition of Microorganism Application (ACMA) in our campus, through which we hosted a huge brainstorm in our campus about all kinds of interesting application of microorganisms, and also spread the knowledge of synthetic biology.

We helped iGEM team China-CD-UESTC with the cryostat section process, and we helped XJTLU-China to build their iGEM team this year.
We improved the characterization of existing Biobrick part BBa_K1375024, and perfected the modeling information of this part.
We used microalgae as our prototype of E. pangu , and we simulated E. pangu â€™s function with microalgae in the lab.
