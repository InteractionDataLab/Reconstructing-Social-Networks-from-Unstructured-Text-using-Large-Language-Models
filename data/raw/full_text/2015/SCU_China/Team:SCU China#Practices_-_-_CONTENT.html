Students were requested to hand in their own idea of a project. They were ranked by the innovation and feasibility of their idea, and the student who ranked first won the fund to realize his or her own project. </P><P>The school started introductory lectures on synthetic biology, and successfully invited students from fifteen schools to take part in the contest, including Electrical engineering, Medical school, Business school and so on. </P><P>We also built an information platform on Wechat, informing students with notices about the contest and some fun facts relating to biology.</P><H2 id="jia">An interview about synthetic biology</H2><H4>Chocolate Martini
