Adrian Lejman
Major: Biotechnology, 3rd year
Why I decided to become a scientist:
I decided to become scientist when I was in primary school. I was excited when I was reading about people who discovered new medicines or find something new about human body. I wanted to become somebody like them. I wanted to learn more and more about biology and living organisms. Although many years have passed and I have read many articles, I still have many unresolved questions that I want to find answer for.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
When I decided to become part of iGEM I thought it was great chance to learn something new and meet fantastic people with passion. I wasn't wrong. iGEM gave me a huge chance to develop. Synthetic biology is an excellent way to create something new which will be useful for another scientists. Achieving pre-peeled goals gives me a lot of satisfaction.
What I do in my free time:
My favorite way to spend free time is sport. I like playing all kind of sports, for example volleyball, running and basketball - but the most I love playing football and riding a bicycle. Another way I like spend my free time is travelling. Walking in the mountains and watching breathtaking views relaxes me.

Why I decided to become a scientist:
I did not, I have just become. But I hope I will be rich!
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
Very innovative - I want to win, meet new people and visit Boston!
What I do in my free time:
I like to exercise unless there is chocolate nearby - then chocolate wins. A good book is my way to relax.
Favourite quote: Always do your best!
Julia Zielińska
Major: Biotechnology, 3rd year
Why I decided to become a scientist:
I've decided to become a scientist, because I've always thought that those people can make a difference and improve other people's lives. I wanted to be one of those special individuals that experience the excitement of the scientific discovery and solve nature's riddles. ...And also, I like the smell of LB medium.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
iGEM competition enables us to work on our own projects and have fun during summer.  I expect to experience the magnificence of combining different parts into a single working organism that demonstrates new activities. I'm excited to meet other participants that love science as much as I do and to share my laboratory skills with them.
What I do in my free time:
I laugh a lot, watch TV shows, lay on the grass and read only good books.
Favourite quote:The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.
Maja Szymańska
Major: Biotechnology, 3rd year
Why I decided to become a scientist:
I always dreamed to make an intellectual or practical contribution to the world. The more articles I read, the more interested I am in this topic. In lab I can satisfy my curiosity and create something unusual.  I enjoy doing experiments and working in lab. I also take pleasure in teaching children and showing them how our world function.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
The major aim of iGEM is to build and test biological systems in living cells ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. That is a great opportunity to create something own what can be useful for the others. If the system works and we obtain what we expected it's unbelievable fantastic feeling. I like facing up to new challenges. I'm convinced that participating in iGEM will allow me to realize my dreams and meet fantastic people.
What I do in my free time:
I like travelling around the world. When I have free time I'm looking for bargain trips. I enjoy bringing back my memories connected with unforgettable places. What is more I love sport. In my free time I do all kinds of sports, for example: zumba, running, tennis, squash, basketball, volleyball etc.
Favourite quote: There is nothing you cannot do - there are only things you haven't done yet.
Marcin Osuch
Major: Biotechnology, 3rd year
Why I decided to become a scientist:
It's simple. I want to earn a lot of money because I will discover or invent something important or helpful for the human race. Or just change the world with a vaccine that cures AIDS or something.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
I will meet people with whom I could cure the world of awful diseases or get the idea of how to create a bacteria that is capable of producing diamonds.
What I do in my free time:
Nothing important - writing books and teaching kids how to live. Sometimes playing on PlayStation.

It's an amazing feeling to get some interesting results and explore something new. Moreover, working with people from which I can derive knowledge give me a pleasure.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
iGEM gives me a great opportunity to improve my skills, get more knowledge about synthetic biology and propagate it. Moreover I can become familiar with new laboratory techniques, important biological matters and meet new interesting people and exchange experiences.
What I do in my free time:
I listen to music all the time and search for some new music and news from music world. I love going to concerts and I enjoy watching dance performances, visiting art galleries and museums. I like dancing, I attend dance classes just for fun and I go to kickboxing classes.

Alicja Rabiasz
Major: Molecular biology, 5th year
Why I decided to become a scientist:
I fell in love with biology under the influence of one of my teachers. I like spending time in laboratory, doing experiments. In lab I train my character and I learn how to be humble and enduring when something does not work out.
What I expect from participating in iGEM:
...great question! :)
What I do in my free time:
In free time I do things that make my relax, e.g walking, reading books or  listening to music.
