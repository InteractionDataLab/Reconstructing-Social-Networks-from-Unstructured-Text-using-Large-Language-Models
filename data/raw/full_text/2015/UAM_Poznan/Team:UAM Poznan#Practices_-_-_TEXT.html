HUMAN PRACTICES
Biology and molecular biology classes
Our constructs, originally containing his-tag, will be also designed with other tags and used for educational purposes, for biotechnology and molecular biology students during their laboratory classes. Our promoters will be useful for the controllable turn on of E.coli genes expression, and also for testing and designing systems for better purification of recombinant proteins produced in E.coli.
Poznań Festival of Science and Art
Our team members took part in a series of workshops prepared for high and middle schoolers. We showed them how to isolate DNA from kiwi, taught them about DNA and cells, also organized a biology related quiz! However, the main attraction was a show with a liquid nitrogen. You can find the photos from this event on our event page.
7th Conference of Polish Society of Experimental Plant Biology
Our group showed the results of experiments on promoters induced by sugars on the 7th Conference of Polish Society of Experimental Plant Biology and the Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology UG & MUG, on the "System and Synthetic Biology" session. The conference took place in Gdańsk, 8-11 September 2015. We prepared two posters - one about the CPEC method and one about the assembly and activity check of our promoters - and also an oral presentation, which was given by Marcin Osuch. The presentation was awarded with a diploma for the best student oral presentation. The conference gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves to the great scientist from all over the world and receive many kind suggestions for our later work. You can find the photos from this event on our event page.
Below the abstracts of our posters from the event:
EcoFactory, a multipromoter explorer expression system for Escherichia coli
Minimal, independently regulated promoters of different expression levels are important tools for   synthetic biology to build complex but compact genetic systems.  It is important for crystallographers    to produce recombinant proteins of high purity and for the pharmaceutical industry  to make the   whole process free of toxic compounds.  Ideally, the expression level should be tuneable, induction -   non-toxic,  mRNA translation – free of mistakes, with perfect folding; recombinant protein - soluble   and homogenous, and finally its purification - fast and reproducible.  We prepared a series of   plasmids expressing his-tagged superfolder GFP (Pedelacq J-D. 2006) under the control of four   nontoxic inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose.  The four promoters are more   controllable than the most popular lactose induced T7RNA polymerase dependent systems.  The   coding sequences are transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase which is slower and more accurate   than T7 RNA polymerase.  SfGFP can be used to compare activities of standard, modified, and   minimal promoters during growth on different carbon sources and as a probe of a fused protein   solubility. We present a  comprehensive comparison of the sfGFP expression driven by inducible   promoters with the insulated, constitutive promoters proC and proD as standards (Davis 2009).   Two   pairs of primers  should be sufficient to clone an ORF of interest as a protein fused to sfGFP or to   replace it in all vectors of the multipromoter system.

Towards the simple and uncompromised  assembly of genetic systems
An underlying necessity of synthetic biology is the ease, simplicity and possible automation of   assembly of genetic systems.  In 2009 J. Quan  and  J. Tian have developed the method for an   efficient construction of combinatorial libraries (CPEC: circular polymerase extension cloning).  At the   same time D. Gibson and his co-workers from Craig Venter Institute have described another    restriction site  independent method of cloning and de novo assembly of large genomes from   overlapping DNA fragments with a mixture of three enzymes: T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA   polymerase and  Taq DNA ligase. The cloning system as well as the nebuilder software for design of   the overlaps are available from New England Biolabs. Although Gibson Assembly is the method of   choice in construction of larger genetic assemblies, we have found that CPEC can be successfully   used for the assembly of smaller genetic systems composed of up to 5 DNA fragments with overlaps   constructed with the nebuilder software.  This cloning system is more flexible and faster than   building more complex constructs from biobricks (2011 Shetty), more precise, more efficient, and   cheaper than Gibson Assemby.  Construct assembly can be completed in 2 -3 days by two rounds of   PCR and  transformation of electrocompetent cells. From a standard cloning we usually obtain   several hundreds of colonies of which almost all contain a construct of the expected assembly and   sequence. The expression system is under development for fast 15-min. purification of soluble   recombinant his-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli.

Night of the Scientists
Constitutive promoters assembled for igem competition will be used during our lab shows on the Night of Scientists, that will take place on the 25th September 2015 at our University. Participants will work with sfGFP under proC promoter and perform protein purification. Our team members will explain processes connected with producing recombinant proteins in E.coli.
