Collaborations
During this year's iGEM edition, we have had a pleasure of collaborating with two fellow wonderful iGEM teams!
Team Aix-Marseille
Team Aix-Marseille invited us to take part in their research regarding the chewing gum. We happily assisted their cause and helped with surveying people about their knowledge of this topic. Result? Huge satisfaction of helping out fellow team and this amazing collaboration badge!
Team Paris-Bettencourt
Team Paris-Bettencourt invited us to join their graphical database called "the iGEM Rhizi" . We eagerly registered at the site as soon as we got the invitational e-mail :). Hopefully iGEM Rhizi soon will be a great database and resource for present and future iGEM teams, because this project looks veeeeery promising!
