Team:UAM Poznan/Goals
Judging form goals
Requirements for Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit iGEM 2015 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Please visit our Team page for further details.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
Please visit our Parts page for an information on all of our 14 Biobricks.
Requirements for Silver Medal
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
Please visit our Parts page for an information on all of our 14 Biobricks.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Please visit our Practices or Events pages for more detailed description (and pictures!).
Requirements for Gold Medal
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project OR demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities).
Please visit our Practices or Events pages for more detailed description (and pictures!).
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
Please visit our Collaborations page for an evaluation.
Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
Other prizes
Education and Public Engagement:
During this year, we took the chance to spread the knowledge about synthetic biology to people of different age groups.
We prepared and carried out a series of biology workshops for high and middle schoolers as a part of Poznan Festival of Science and Art.
This September, our group gave out an oral presentation about our iGEM Project at 7th Conference of Polish Society of Experimental Plant Biology. The presentation was a huge sucess and Marcin (the presenter) received a diploma for the best oral presentation.
On September 25th, we plan on incorporating EcoFactory as one of the attractions of the Night of the Scientists - a huge event open for everyone.
In the near future, we plan on adjusting EcoFactory for use of the students who are attending biotechnology and molecular biology courses at our university.
Applied Design
We provide an effective and robust xylose induced promoter derived from E. coli genome, what is an impotrant objective in biofuel production. Reduction of promoter sizes, the diversification and/or improvement of their inducibility gives opportunity to obtain different levels of expression of two or more genes with one inducer. The use of 4 different inducers is a good starting point to build more complex genetic circuits for synthetic biology.
Best Parts
Best New Basic Part - we have provided the id of our best part.
Best Part Collection - we have provided the id list of our submitted parts.
We provide a prototype of a four promoters which can be almost independently regulated in E. coli. This makes possible to make more complex expression or genetic systems in which several genes can be regulated almost independently. Different promoter versions give the opportunity to choose the intensity of expression. Such a system should be useful for more precise design of secretion systems or investigations of protein-protein interactions. Activity of all promoters can be blocked by glucose and not by glycerol which can be used as an alternative carbon source. Promoter xylA can be as useful as popular arabinose induced promoters. We have shown that inducibility  can be enhanced by slight changes in 5â€™UTRs and promoters. We have 10 fold reduced the size of arabinose promoter without significant loss of its functionality. All promoters use the cellular RNA polymerase which results in high accuracy of trancription.
