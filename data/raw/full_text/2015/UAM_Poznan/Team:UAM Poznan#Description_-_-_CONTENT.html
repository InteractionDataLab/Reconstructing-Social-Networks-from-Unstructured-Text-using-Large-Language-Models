The pET expression system is a lactose induced T7 polymerase dependent system.
This system, however, has few downsides: i) the system tends to leak; ii) it is very hard to control the protein expression level once it is induced; iii) being a viral polymerase,T7 polymerase has a tendency to insert the mismatches (mutations) in the transcripted sequence; iv) if the produced protein is toxic for the host, the bacterial culture can decline before the desired concentration of the protein of interest is manufactured; v) the organized and stable transfer of the produced protein to i.e. a medium can prove difficult to carry out. </P><P> Therefore, we decided to seek an alternate solution to use in protein expression.	
We prepared a series of plasmids expressing his-tagged superfolder GFP under the control of four nontoxic inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose.  The four promoters are more controllable than the most popular lactose induced T7RNA polymerase dependent systems. The coding sequences are transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase which is slower and more accurate than T7 RNA polymerase.  SfGFP can be used to compare activities of standard, modified, and minimal promoters during growth on different carbon sources and as well as a probe of a fused protein solubility. We present a  comprehensive comparison of the sfGFP expression driven by inducible promoters with the insulated, constitutive promoters proC and proD as standards. Two pairs of primers  should be sufficient to clone an ORF of interest as a protein fused to sfGFP or to replace it in all vectors of the mulltipromoter system. </P><P> Our next step is to compare the efficiency between these promoters and test their function when grown on the media consisting of different components.</P><P>All promoter fragments derive from Escherichia coli K12, strain DH5 alpha, some elements are synthetic. Chromosomal DNA of E. coli was isolated as described in the methods section.</P><A name="Arabinose"><H2>Arabinose induced promoters</H2></A><H4>sfGFP under arabinose promoter s1 without AraC (Arashort1) - BBa_K1741000</H4><P>In commercially available expression vectors arabinose promoter araBAD is usually used together with a gene for AraC transcription activator / repressor to make the system independent of chromosomal copy of AraC gene. We fused  the araBAD promoter without AraC reading frame, as other sugar induced promoters to sfGFP. The shorter version of the popular promoter is still functional i.e. induced by arabinose. Arabinose induced (0,4%) in a a short time (1-8h) expression is a bit lower than driven by AraC-araBAD but after a longer time like 18h the GFP level is higher than from AraC-araBAD promoter. New shorter versions of arabinose induced promoters, all originating from E. coli genome were compared to the biobrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1481002" target="_blank">BBa_K1481002</A>, provided last year by Poznan_Bioinf team (labeled as AraWT in the comparison chart).The sequence of this promoter starts from O2 region the left part of the binding site of AraC in absence of arabinose.  </P><P>You can find this part's sequence with more information in registry: <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1741000" target="_blank">BBa_K1741000.</A></P><H4>sfGFP under a short arabinose promoter s2 without O1 and O2 - BBa_K1741002</H4><P>This shortened version of araBAD promoter does not contain O1 and O2 regions, but still contains the CRP binding site. We can expect than  this version of araBAD will be still repressed by CRP but not by AraC without arabinose. From our preliminary experiments it appears that the promoter is more strongly induced by arabinose than AraC-AraBAD but is weaker than arashort1. All three arabinose pomoters are repressed by glucose. </P><P>You can find this part's sequence with more information in registry: <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1741002" target="_blank">BBa_K1741002.</A></P><H4>Arabinose induced promoters comparison</H4><P align="center">The fluorescence was measured after 18h-growth.

The modified 5’UTR  results in about twice higher expression upon melibiose addition to the M9 or 2xLB medium. The promer is still weaker than araBAD or rhaBAD, so can be a promoter of choice if lower expression level is necessary for efficient folding or secretion of a recombinant protein.
