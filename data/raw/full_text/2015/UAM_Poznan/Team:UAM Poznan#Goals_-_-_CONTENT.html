		During this year, we took the chance to spread the knowledge about synthetic biology to people of different age groups.
		We prepared and carried out a series of biology workshops for high and middle schoolers as a part of Poznan Festival of Science and Art.

		This September, our group gave out an oral presentation about our iGEM Project at 7th Conference of Polish Society of Experimental Plant Biology. The presentation was a huge sucess and Marcin (the presenter) received a diploma for the best oral presentation.

		On September 25th, we plan on incorporating EcoFactory as one of the attractions of the Night of the Scientists - a huge event open for everyone.

		In the near future, we plan on adjusting EcoFactory for use of the students who are attending biotechnology and molecular biology courses at our university.</LI><LI><B>Applied Design</B>
We provide an effective and robust xylose induced promoter derived from E. coli genome, what is an impotrant objective in biofuel production. Reduction of promoter sizes, the diversification and/or improvement of their inducibility gives opportunity to obtain different levels of expression of two or more genes with one inducer. The use of 4 different inducers is a good starting point to build more complex genetic circuits for synthetic biology.</LI></UL><H4>Best Parts</H4><UL class="goals"><LI>Best New Basic Part - we have provided the id of our best part.</LI><LI>Best Part Collection - we have provided the id list of our submitted parts.
	We provide a prototype of a four promoters which can be almost independently regulated in E. coli. This makes possible to make more complex expression or genetic systems in which several genes can be regulated almost independently. Different promoter versions give the opportunity to choose the intensity of expression. Such a system should be useful for more precise design of secretion systems or investigations of protein-protein interactions. Activity of all promoters can be blocked by glucose and not by glycerol which can be used as an alternative carbon source. Promoter xylA can be as useful as popular arabinose induced promoters. We have shown that inducibility  can be enhanced by slight changes in 5â€™UTRs and promoters. We have 10 fold reduced the size of arabinose promoter without significant loss of its functionality. All promoters use the cellular RNA polymerase which results in high accuracy of trancription.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
