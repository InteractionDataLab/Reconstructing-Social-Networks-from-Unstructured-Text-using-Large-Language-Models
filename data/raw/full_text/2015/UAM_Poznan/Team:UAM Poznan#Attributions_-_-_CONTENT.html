  I decided to become scientist when I was in primary school. I was excited when I was reading about people who discovered new medicines or find something new about human body. I wanted to become somebody like them. I wanted to learn more and more about biology and living organisms. Although many years have passed and I have read many articles, I still have many unresolved questions that I want to find answer for.
</P><P><B>What I expect from participating in iGEM:</B>
  When I decided to become part of iGEM I thought it was great chance to learn something new and meet fantastic people with passion. I wasn't wrong. iGEM gave me a huge chance to develop. Synthetic biology is an excellent way to create something new which will be useful for another scientists. Achieving pre-peeled goals gives me a lot of satisfaction. 
</P><P><B>What I do in my free time:</B>
  My favorite way to spend free time is sport. I like playing all kind of sports, for example volleyball, running and basketball - but the most I love playing football and riding a bicycle. Another way I like spend my free time is travelling. Walking in the mountains and watching breathtaking views relaxes me.

  I always dreamed to make an intellectual or practical contribution to the world. The more articles I read, the more interested I am in this topic. In lab I can satisfy my curiosity and create something unusual.  I enjoy doing experiments and working in lab. I also take pleasure in teaching children and showing them how our world function. </P><P><B>What I expect from participating in iGEM:</B>
  The major aim of iGEM is to build and test biological systems in living cells ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. That is a great opportunity to create something own what can be useful for the others. If the system works and we obtain what we expected it's unbelievable fantastic feeling. I like facing up to new challenges. I'm convinced that participating in iGEM will allow me to realize my dreams and meet fantastic people. </P><P><B>What I do in my free time:</B>
  I like travelling around the world. When I have free time I'm looking for bargain trips. I enjoy bringing back my memories connected with unforgettable places. What is more I love sport.
