DNA quantitation
To quantitate plasmid DNA and PCR products, absorbance spectrum and A260 was measured on NanoDrop spectrophotometer . Quantitation was verified by gel electrophoresis in 1-1,5% agarose gels in TAE buffer, pre-stained with ethidium bromide (100ng/ml). By gel image analysis we were also able to check the purity of plasmid DNA and quality of PCR products.
DNA amplification
Primers for PCR were designed using Primer 3 [ 1 , 2 ] to have the same calculated melting temperature of 60°C. This way fragments of similar sizes can be amplified at the same time on one thermal cycler.

Gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments
Weigh 0,6g of agarose and pour into a 250 ml screw cap Simax bottle.
Add 50ml of H2ODEPC and 1 ml of 50xTAE buffer, mix.
Heat up for 2 minutes in microwave oven until the agarose sol is homogeneous. Cool the bottle shortly under tap water. Add 0,5 μl ethidium bromide (10mg/ml). Mix well.
Pour the agarose sol into a gel casting tray. Insert the appropriate comb. If necessary, clear the bubbles with a pipette tip. Wait until the gel is fully solidified.
Pour TAE buffer onto the gel, remove the comb and casting gates. Pour TAE buffer to buffer tanks to cover the gel with 1mm of the buffer.
Mix the samples with loading dye in a 5:1 ratio. Put the samples into the wells. We used two DNA molecular weight markers: 100 bp DNA Ladder and 1 kb DNA Ladder (NEB).
Elution of DNA fragments from agarose gel
After electrophoresis, agarose gels were photographed on UV transiluminator (SynGene) and DNA fragments of interest were excised with a clean razor blade and placed in weighed Eppendorf tubes . DNA fragments were purified on Zippy silica columns, according to the protocol provided by ZYMO RESEARCH .
Chromosomal DNA isolation from E.coli
Spin down 0,5 ml of E. coli culture OD=0,6 for 3 min. at 5000g and remove the supernatant.
Suspend the pellet in 200μl of buffer A(150 mM NaCl,100 mM EDTA pH=8,0).
Add 10 μl of fresh lysozyme suspension (10 mg/ml), incubate at . 37°C for 15 min.
Add 20 μl 10% SDS and 1μl proteinase K, mix well, incubate at 56°C for 15 min.
Cool down the mixture to RT, add 100 μl chloroform and 100 μl phenol pH=8,0, vortex for 1 min. Centrifuge for 5 min. at 12K.
Carefully transfer the upper water phase containing nucleic acids to a new tube, add equal volume of ethanol, mix well and centrifuge as above.
Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 70% ethanol, spin down for 1 min. at 12K, remove the supernatant carefully to leave the pellet only.
Add 50 μl H2O, incubate at 56°C for 2 min., mix well by pipetting.
Check the quality on 0,8% agarose gel. The main DNA band should represent molecules longer than 20 kb.
Use 0,1- 0,5 μg of chromosomal DNA to amplify a gene of interest.
All promoter sequences we use derive from the chromosomal DNA of E. coli DH5α.
Construct and part design
Constructs were designed by using the NEBuilder with a minimal length of overlaps of 18 bp.
Parts of constructs were designed to be easily amplified with primers of the same melting temperature of 60°C. These PCR products of expected size were excised from agarose gels and reamplified with a pair of primers containing sequences of overlaps, and again purified from agarose gels. The initial primers we use to verify the structure of the final construct, as well as for sequencing. Verification of construct structure by Sanger sequencing was performed in our Faculty sequencing lab.
Construct assembly by CPEC (circular polymerase extension cloning)
The purified PCR products containing overlaps were quantitated on nanodrop spectrophotometer. Sizes of these DNA fragments to be mixed were checked by electrophoresis in agarose gels. Then fragments were mixed to obtain the molar ratio, like:  2(promoter) : 2(CDS) : 1(vector).
Optimal amounts of DNA fragments were as in example: Promoter (300bp) 60ng : CDS (1000bp) 200ng: PSB1C3 vector (2070bp) 200ng.

Just proceed to Zippy Plasmid Miniprep Kit procedure starting from step 1. One silica column will bind up to 50μg of plasmid DNA at one binding session  so one can purify 200 μg of high quality plasmid DNA on one minicolumn.
After checking the quality by agarose gel electrophoresis and A260 measurement, the plasmid DNA is ready for sequencing and RE digestions, cloning, and transfections.

Construct verification by colony PCR and Sanger sequencing
Pick up several colonies of interest with a sterile toothpick and streak them on one or two new selective plates with numbered fields. Wipe the remaining part of the colony on the bottom of a 1,5 ml Eppendorf tube. Use the same numbering for tubes as for fields on plates.
Add 50-100μl of H2O to each tube, incubate at 96°C for 10 min. Cool down by centrifugation for 2 min. at 12K. Transfer 2μl to a new PCR tube.
Use Taq DNA polymerase for colony PCR. Prepare a standard PCR mix leaving 2 μl of the total volume for the template. Consider an additional volume for a positive control, like just an empty plasmid.
Add 48μl of PCR mix to every tube. Prepare a positive control. Run a standard PCR.
Check the sizes of amplicons by gel electrophoresis in agarose gel.
Sanger sequencing of constructs was performed in our Faculty facility on ABI Prism capillary system. We provided plasmids which were purified as described above (11) with VF and VR primers and primers used for amplification of parts of our constructs – these shorter ones, without overlaps. To obtain better results, i.e. longer sequences we purified some primers by electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel with 7M urea.
