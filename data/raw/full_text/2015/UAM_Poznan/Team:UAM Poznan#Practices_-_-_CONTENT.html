The conference took place in Gdańsk, 8-11 September 2015. We prepared two posters - one about the CPEC method and one about the assembly and activity check of our promoters - and also an oral presentation, which was given by Marcin Osuch. The presentation was awarded with a diploma for the best student oral presentation. The conference gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves to the great scientist from all over the world and receive many kind suggestions for our later work.

Below the abstracts of our posters from the event:</P><H4>EcoFactory, a multipromoter explorer expression system for <I>Escherichia coli</I></H4><P>Minimal, independently regulated promoters of different expression levels are important tools for 

synthetic biology to build complex but compact genetic systems.  It is important for crystallographers  

to produce recombinant proteins of high purity and for the pharmaceutical industry  to make the 

whole process free of toxic compounds.  Ideally, the expression level should be tuneable, induction - 

non-toxic,  mRNA translation – free of mistakes, with perfect folding; recombinant protein - soluble 

and homogenous, and finally its purification - fast and reproducible.  We prepared a series of 

plasmids expressing his-tagged superfolder GFP (Pedelacq J-D. 2006) under the control of four 

nontoxic inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose.  The four promoters are more 

controllable than the most popular lactose induced T7RNA polymerase dependent systems.  The 

coding sequences are transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase which is slower and more accurate 

than T7 RNA polymerase.  SfGFP can be used to compare activities of standard, modified, and 

minimal promoters during growth on different carbon sources and as a probe of a fused protein 

solubility. We present a  comprehensive comparison of the sfGFP expression driven by inducible 

promoters with the insulated, constitutive promoters proC and proD as standards (Davis 2009).   Two 

pairs of primers  should be sufficient to clone an ORF of interest as a protein fused to sfGFP or to 

replace it in all vectors of the multipromoter system.<B>Authors:</B>  Zielińska J.,  Mokrzycka D., Lejman A., Szymańska M., Osuch M., Olejniczak O.,  Kopa M.,

assembly of genetic systems.  In 2009 J. Quan  and  J. Tian have developed the method for an 

efficient construction of combinatorial libraries (CPEC: circular polymerase extension cloning).  At the 

same time D. Gibson and his co-workers from Craig Venter Institute have described another  

restriction site  independent method of cloning and de novo assembly of large genomes from 

overlapping DNA fragments with a mixture of three enzymes: T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA 

polymerase and  Taq DNA ligase. The cloning system as well as the nebuilder software for design of 

the overlaps are available from New England Biolabs. Although Gibson Assembly is the method of 

choice in construction of larger genetic assemblies, we have found that CPEC can be successfully 

used for the assembly of smaller genetic systems composed of up to 5 DNA fragments with overlaps 

constructed with the nebuilder software.  This cloning system is more flexible and faster than 

building more complex constructs from biobricks (2011 Shetty), more precise, more efficient, and 

cheaper than Gibson Assemby.  Construct assembly can be completed in 2 -3 days by two rounds of 

PCR and  transformation of electrocompetent cells. From a standard cloning we usually obtain 

several hundreds of colonies of which almost all contain a construct of the expected assembly and 

sequence. The expression system is under development for fast 15-min. purification of soluble 

recombinant his-tagged proteins in <I>Escherichia coli</I>.  <B>Authors:</B>  Zielińska J.,  Mokrzycka D., Lejman A., Szymańska M., Osuch M.,  Olejniczak O.,  Rabiasz A.,
