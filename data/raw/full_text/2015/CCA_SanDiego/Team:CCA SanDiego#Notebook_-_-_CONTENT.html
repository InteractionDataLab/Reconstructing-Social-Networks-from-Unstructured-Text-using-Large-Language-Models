We conducted research on potential projects. Suggestions included a smog filter composed of organic compounds to carry out anoxic decomposition, a method to mimic the glutamate protein pump in the brain to ensure the glutamate-GABA balance, a way to mimic the manner by which animals can predict coming natural disasters such as earthquakes, and gene repair through harnessing of the RAD51 gene.</P><SPAN class="cd-date">2 October 2014</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-timeline-block"><DIV class="cd-timeline-content"><P>Julia Wisnia, Miya Coimbra, Ariel Braunstein, Olivia Shiah, Amanda Matheson, Vivian Patton, Ravi Agarwal, and Maggie Chen met to continue brainstorming projects. We decided that mimicking animal detection of earthquakes was not a feasible option for synthetic biology using E. coli since it would likely require a complex nervous system. New ideas were conceived of (including possibilities for electrosynthesis, quorum sensing, and prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome), but still the most plausible candidate for a synthetic biology application was determined to be gene repair using RAD51.</P><SPAN class="cd-date">9 October 2014</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-timeline-block"><DIV class="cd-timeline-content"><P>Another meeting was held among Julia Wisnia, Miya Coimbra, Ariel Braunstein, Olivia Shiah, Amanda Matheson, Vivian Patton, Ravi Agarwal, Maggie Chen, and Harrison Harris. Further research on potential projects was conducted. We also discussed iGEM fees and possible ways to fundraise; ideas included a bake sale, donations from family, and fundraising programs through local restaurants (such as Souplantation and Rubio’s). Miya Coimbra and Julia Wisnia discussed their attempts to find graduate student mentors from UCSD through email contact; unfortunately, responses are fairly intermittent.</P><SPAN class="cd-date">23 October 2014</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cd-timeline-block"><DIV class="cd-timeline-content"><P>Today was a finals day for CCA students, so school ended early (12:25 p.m.).
