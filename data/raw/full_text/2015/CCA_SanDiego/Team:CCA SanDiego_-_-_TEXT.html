About the Project
About our project
Biosensors are at the forefront of biomedical and bioengineering research because of their applicability to a wide range of diseases. Using computer modeling we simulated the behavior of a glucose sensing biosensor, which fluoresces in the presence of glucose. This serves as an effective monitor of blood glucose levels, a critical biomarker for diabetes. Our biosensor could be coupled with an insulin producing circuit to treat diabetes without invasive needles and injections.
