Outreach
Twice weekly several members of our iGEM team went to Solana Ranch, a new elementary school near our high school, CCA, to tutor students. The tutoring was available to all students at the school, meaning we were working with kids in grades ranging from kindergarten to the sixth grade.  This posed a unique challenge as we might be working with a seven year old one minute and an eleven year old the next, each with very different abilities.  We focused on the children’s learning needs above all,  representing ourselves as an iGEM team.  We helped them achieve their educational goals while also emphasizing the importance of STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) subjects.  It’s really amazing to think that we could have inspired a future scientist, but above that, knowing that we definitely gave the little ones something to look forward to, which is huge in a child’s life.
