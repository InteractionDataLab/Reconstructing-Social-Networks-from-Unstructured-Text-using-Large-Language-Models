This graph shows the potential energy levels of each simulations as it runs. The goal of the simulation is to the stable energy level for each of the conditions. The potential energy level closest to zero is most stable, so based on the graph the simulations run by Olivia are the most stable. Olivia's simulations stabilized around -350,000, where Miya's was around -365,000 and Julia's was -395,000.
