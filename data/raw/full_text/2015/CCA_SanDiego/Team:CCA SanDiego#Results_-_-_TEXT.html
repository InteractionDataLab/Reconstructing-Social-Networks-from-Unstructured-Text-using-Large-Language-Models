Project Results
This graph shows the potential energy levels of each simulations as it runs. The goal of the simulation is to the stable energy level for each of the conditions. The potential energy level closest to zero is most stable, so based on the graph the simulations run by Olivia are the most stable. Olivia's simulations stabilized around -350,000, where Miya's was around -365,000 and Julia's was -395,000.
Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.
What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project
Considerations for replicating the experiments
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.
