Julia Wisnia and Miya Coimbra officially formed the CCA iGEM team and began plans to recruit members through word-of-mouth, publication in school announcements, and contacts with high school science teachers.
18 September 2014
Our initial members, including Julia Wisnia, Miya Coimbra, Ariel Braunstein, Olivia Shiah, Amanda Matheson, and Vivian Patton, held the first official meeting. We conducted research on potential projects. Suggestions included a smog filter composed of organic compounds to carry out anoxic decomposition, a method to mimic the glutamate protein pump in the brain to ensure the glutamate-GABA balance, a way to mimic the manner by which animals can predict coming natural disasters such as earthquakes, and gene repair through harnessing of the RAD51 gene.
2 October 2014
Julia Wisnia, Miya Coimbra, Ariel Braunstein, Olivia Shiah, Amanda Matheson, Vivian Patton, Ravi Agarwal, and Maggie Chen met to continue brainstorming projects. We decided that mimicking animal detection of earthquakes was not a feasible option for synthetic biology using E. coli since it would likely require a complex nervous system. New ideas were conceived of (including possibilities for electrosynthesis, quorum sensing, and prevention of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome), but still the most plausible candidate for a synthetic biology application was determined to be gene repair using RAD51.
9 October 2014
Another meeting was held among Julia Wisnia, Miya Coimbra, Ariel Braunstein, Olivia Shiah, Amanda Matheson, Vivian Patton, Ravi Agarwal, Maggie Chen, and Harrison Harris. Further research on potential projects was conducted. We also discussed iGEM fees and possible ways to fundraise; ideas included a bake sale, donations from family, and fundraising programs through local restaurants (such as Souplantation and Rubioâ€™s). Miya Coimbra and Julia Wisnia discussed their attempts to find graduate student mentors from UCSD through email contact; unfortunately, responses are fairly intermittent.
23 October 2014
Today was a finals day for CCA students, so school ended early (12:25 p.m.). An after-school meeting was scheduled to Skype with three new potential mentors (Jenhan Tao, Sophia Hirakis, and Benjamin Kellman). The meeting was attended by Julia, Miya, Ariel, and Olivia; it was fairly brief and primarily went over the potential projects that we had brainstormed earlier.
28 October 2014
Miya, Ariel, Olivia, Amanda, Ravi, and Maggie attended a meeting to discuss fundraising. Souplantation gives a larger percentage of proceeds for fundraising events and is likely to be more popular among families, so we decided to schedule an appointment with them to host an event.
30 October 2014
A fundraising event was held in the evening for families and friends to eat at Souplantation and for some of the proceeds to go toward funding our iGEM activities. Julia, Miya, Olivia, Amanda, Vivian, and Ravi attended.
6 November 2014
Julia, Miya, Ariel, Olivia, Vivian, Ravi, Maggie, and Harrison attended a meeting after school to discuss topics and mentors. Unfortunately, based on prior discussions
13 November 2014
Julia, Miya, Ariel, Olivia, Vivian, Ravi, Maggie, and Harrison attended a meeting after school to review the basic methodology of various wet lab techniques like PCR, gel electrophoresis, transfection and cell culture in order to prepare for the wet lab work that would come later in the project.
20 November 2014
Julia, Miya, Ariel, Amanda, Olivia, Ravi, Harrison, Maggie, and Vivian met with Sophia Hirakis at the Salk Institute to review a wide range of biology concepts that would be helpful in the development and completion of our project.
2 December 2014
Julia, Miya, Ariel, Amanda, Olivia, Ravi, Harrison, Maggie, and Vivian attended a meeting after school with Benjamin Kellman to review more concepts. This time we focused mostly on DNA and its structure and function, as well as ways that it can be altered.
10 December 2014
Julia and Miya had a meeting with the mentors concerning the logistics of the project, such as where the team would meet, what time the meetings would be, and days of the week.  They also talked about a general computational approach that we could apply to our project.
12 December 2014

5 February 2015
Our team received a generous donation of $2500 from a local company, Cymer. This donation helped provide the funding necessary to register for the Jamboree and let us continue the project. Our whole team was very grateful and we sent a thank you note signed by the whole team to each of the company executives.

25 June 2015
The team continues with the tutorials to familiarize themselves with the programs they will be using.  They have completed the AMBER tutorial and now move onto the NAMD tutorial, the program that will allow them to run the biosensor in the environments they will create in AMBER.
30 June 2015
Students continue with the NAMD tutorial.  Their mentors guide them with the future applications of this tutorial.
2 July 2015
Julia, Miya, Ariel, Amanda, Oliva, and Maggie continue with the first NAMD tutorial out of 3.
7 July 2015
Students continue with tutorials and taking notes on what they are learning so they are able to recall the information when they begin designing parameters and the biosensor.
9 July 2015
Students finish the second NAMD tutorial, and now to move onto the third.
14 July 2015
Students continue with the third and final NAMD tutorial.
16 July 2015
Students complete the third NAMD tutorial, and now dive into designing their project.
21 July 2015
Students begin designating parameters and conditions under which they will test their biosensors.  They use the information they used from the AMBER tutorials to guide them as they design an environment similar to the body in ph, temperature, etc.
23 July 2015
Julia, Miya, Amanda, Olivia, and Ariel continue researching biosensors and working to design a more effective biosensor.  Aided by their mentors, they continue designing parameters and experiments to be run.
28 July 2015
The team continues working with AMBER to design their project.
30 July 2015
The team nears the end of designing environments to run the biosensor with, but still have a few representations to complete.  Work continues with AMBER.
4 August 2015
Julia, Miya, Oliva, Amanda, and Ariel work to edit the text files that will be used in the NAMD simulations.
6 August 2015
Julia, Miya, and Olivia move on to editing the final project representations, and are almost ready to create .pdb files with the text they have already screened for additional hydrogen molecules, anomalies, etc.
11 August 2015
Julia, Miya, and Olivia have a short meeting with mentors to discuss what the next month will look like for the team.  They decide that they will run simulations and begin work on the teamâ€™s wiki page.
13 August 2015
The team uses the text files they have been creating to run the simulations, and run them through Cambridge Universityâ€™s website, WebCSD to create the .pdb files that will later be used to produce the .prmtop files needed to run the simulations.
18 August 2015
Work on the wiki begins as the project is still underway.  The mentors tell students to begin by writing short blurbs about themselves to give people an idea of who the team is in addition to the work we are doing.
20 August 2015
Wiki work continues. One of the teamâ€™s main goals is to create their project abstract, and finish their project description.  They are able to complete the abstract, but only get about halfway through the project description.
25 August 2015
Olivia and Amanda continue work on the project description while Ariel and Julia begin work on the Human Practices and Safety pages.  Julia researches cases of wet lab work becoming dangerous for not only the lab members, but also the communities surrounding the labs.
27 August 2015
Under the guidance of our mentors, Julia and Amanda worked on continuing writing pages for the wiki. Julia worked on the Human Practices and Safety pages, while Amanda worked on compiling and designing the Notebook. We also began to review and compile the team page based on the individual biographies sent in by the various members.
