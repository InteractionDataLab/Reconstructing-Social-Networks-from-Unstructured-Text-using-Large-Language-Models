Modern everyday life is fast...
...too fast for spending unnecessary time at the doctor’s and waiting weeks for your test results.
Not to mention spending lots of money on numerous serological tests for your diagnosis. Wouldn't life be easier if a single test was sufficient?
This is the reason why we thought about a universally accessible, cost and time efficient diagnostic device and developed the DiaCHIP!

Introduction
DiaCHIP - Enlightening Diagnostics
In modern medicine, fast detection and differentiation of diseases is a crucial and fundamental task. Typical ELISA-based assays are time-consuming and expensive. We propose an advanced procedure for the simultaneous detection of various diseases in a fast and inexpensive manner, the DiaCHIP. Our approach is based on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigens. Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patient’s blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference). Offering simultaneous screening for several diseases, our DiaCHIP has strong potential to improve future diagnostics.
