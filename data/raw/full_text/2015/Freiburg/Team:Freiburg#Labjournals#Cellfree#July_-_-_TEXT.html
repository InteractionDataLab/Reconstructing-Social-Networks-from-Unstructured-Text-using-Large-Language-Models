pIG15_105 PCR products were extracted from gel and purified with Qiagen. The resulting DNA showed impurities around 230 nm in repeated measurements in the NanoDrop.
→ resulting DNA was not used for expression
HA-GFP-His6-His6 PCR product was retested in a control gel with a 20 µl sample. The resulting band hints at low DNA concentration
pIG15_105 PCRs from 28.07. and 29.07. were also retested by loading 20 µl in a gel. Since again no bands showed up, the PCRs should be repeated using smaller aliquots.
Thu, 30.07.2015
PCR purification of pIG15_104 and HA-GFP-His6-His6
control gel of HA-GFP-His6-His6
after gel extraction DNA concentrations in 22 µl ddH2O with two columns per PCR were a little too low for expression. Therefore the Zymo DNA Concentrator Kit was used to pool both tubes to a total elution volume of 15 µl. After concentrating the DNA concentration diminished to 189.6 ng/µl (HA-GFP-His6-His6) and 107.6 ng/µl (pIG15_104). A second elution did no longer contain clean DNA.
Both PCRs have to be repeated.
Careful when using the DNA concentrator kit. It doesn't always work.
Repetition of PCR for cell-free expression template of pIG15_104, pIG15_105 and HA-GFP-His6-His6
Both PCRs are performed in 5 x 100 µl reactions with pre-purified PCR product as template (5,2 ng/µl (104) 4,2 ng/µl (GFP)) in 40 cycles
All PCRs should be purified on 4 columns and eluted in 10 µl of water.

PCR for 104 looks as expected and will be purified for further use, PCR for 105 has to be repeated.
Because the first control gel did not show a ladder, a second gel electrophoresis was performed.
*a mistake in programming the cycler occurred and the annealing temperature was stuck at 62°C after touchdown.
Cellfree expression from yesterday was analyzed under a fluorescence microsope
YFP filter set showed no visible fluorescence
GFP filter set showed fluorescence in negative control and the combination of Bernhard lysate and Promega kit. Fluorescence in the negative control was less compared to the background.

Platereader experiment at AG Roth/Diengel together with Norman
Use of 4 different mixes: A) One from Norman that he regularly uses („RTS-Kit“), F) Koko's lysate + reaction mix after EMBL, G) Bernhard's lysate + reaction mix after Bernhard and H) the commercial Promega S30 extract Kit for linear templates.

cloning of pIG15_105:
To clone HALO-tag into corresponding vectors, a gradient PCR was performed on template vector (AG Roth) with oIG105 and oIG106. The resulting fragment should be 931bp. A gradient was done using 8 reaction conditions from 50-60 degrees Celsius. PCR was performed with 32 cycles and 1 min elongation time.
Correct bands visible for all reactions, except negative control. Fragments of the three most specific reaction temperatures excised, gel extracted and blunt end ligated into the pJET1.2 blunt end cloning vector (Thermo Fischer, Darmstadt). Selection on Amp+ plates (50 µl and 100 µl of cells spread onto two plates). Negative control was set up without PCR fragment.

Sequencing of pIG15_105 wasn't positive –> still spy tag inside of vector –> problems with AflII
New try with fermentas Enzymes and fast digest needed

keep the rest at 4°C as backup until transformation worked
Retrafo of diffent plasmids that were obtained from AG Roth
pQE HA-GFP-2xHis6
pQE HA-GFP-His6
pQE Ha-GFP
these plasmids were extensivly tested at AG Roth and show very good expresssion levels
These plasmis will be used as additional control (esp. HA-tag seems ta be able to increse yield 10X)
Additionally several primers for the creation of linear fragments from the pQE vectors were obtained
Amino primer for and rev
Primer without aminogroup for cellfree testing
Primer with CY3 for testing the binding to surface
Primer with TUS/Ter as a binding control
miniprep of cultures from yesterday
2 x pQE-60 GFP-His(134 ng/µl but difficulties with dirth in the 220 nm area in one sample (marked)/130ng/µl)
2 x pIG15_104 (160ng/µl / 164ng/µl)
repetition of halo-pcr performed exactly as on 13.06. → freezer
Wed, 01.07.2015
overnight culture for mini prep (so that enough plasmid is in storage for plate reade experiment)
2 x pQE-60 GFP-His
2 x pIG15_104
CfEX GFP from the 2. Cellfree raction was send for measuring in the irif
test digest of Halo-tag in pJet and pIG15_105
Bands on slightly wrong height –> send for sequencing with s003
