Experiment 3 : APTES/PDITC slides
2015.03.31
iRIF-slides:
BW-A-01-001-[314]
BW-A-01-002-[315]
normale Detektion (strep-cy5):
SN-A-01-001
SN-A-01-002
SN-A-01-003
SN-A-01-004
Coomassie-Detektion:
SB-A-08-001
SB-A-08-002
SB-A-08-003
SB-A-08-004
Experimental/Protocol:
Protocols for APTES/PDITC-slides and plasma activation (quantities x2 because 10 slides)
For SB-A-08-001 and SB-A-08-002 BSA was directly added on the PDITC surface according to the protocol (–> APTES+PDITC+BSA). Slides were then incubated in Coomassie for 30 min and cleaned with water. Slides SB-A-08-003 and SB-A-08-004 were directly incubated in Coomassie for 30 min and cleaned with water. No BSA was added.
2015.04.01
Experimental/Protocol:
SN-A-01-001 and SN-A-01-004 were coated/overlayed with 40 µL of Strep-Cy5
SN-A-01-002 and SN-A-01-003 formed a Strep-Sandwich (80 µL Strep-Cy5)
BW-A-01-001 and BW-A-01-002 were prepared according to the protocol up to the blocking with BSA. Strep-Cy5 was added in the flow cell during iRIF measurement.

BW-A-01-001-[314]
All 5 spots could be detected but the bBSA-spots had a strong comet tail. This might be due to proteins adhering to the surface during the washing step. The intensity of the bBSA-spots was about 20 000. DNA-spots had an intensity of 2800-4000. The background was about 100.

Remarks
After incubation in Strep-Cy5 slides should not be rinsed with water but let slip into a „Kegelvase“ filled with water to prevent comet tails.

Experimental/Protocol:
Protocols for APTES/PDITC and Plasma activation
APTES-solution for 5 slides (V = 20 mL)
acetone
18.8 mL
aqua dest.
1 mL
APTES
0.2 mL
PDITC-solution for 5 slides (V = XX mL)
Pyridine
2.0 mL
DMF
18.0 mL
PDITC
40 mg
DNA-control-solution for 5 slides (10 spots á 0.5 µL, 2 µM)
NaPi-buffer pH 8.3
15 µL
aqua RNAse free
9 µL
DNA
6 µL
On each slide : 2 spots DNA and 3 spots bBSA
Incubate overnight
2015.03.26
Experimental/Protocol:
Spots on slides SB-01 and SB-03 were dried on air.
Spots on slides SB-02 SB-04 and SB-05 were rinsed off with water.
For blocking with BSA the Sandwich-technique was used. Slide SB-02 was just ovrlayed with 70 µL BSA (no sandwich).
Results:
slide
results
SB-01
All 5 spots could be detected but slide has not been washed carefully enough.
SB-02
Not beautiful.
SB-03
2 spots observed
SB-04
All 5 spots observed + 2 more above the expected pattern. Spots must have been transferred from one slide to the other during sandwich-time.
SB-05
5 spots observed. All the bBSA spots had diverged.
Mean intensities of spots and background. Standard deviation is shown as error bars
Remarks
Always store APTES with Parafilm
Slides with APTES+PDITC can be stored up to 2 or 3 days
Spot-technique is used on PDITC-slides because the reaction is slower and homogene (avoids comet tails)

Experimental/Protocol:
Protocols for GOPTS surface , Plasma activation and Protein stamping with PDMS
bBSA-solution (50-60 µL) was pipetted on stamps
After stamping on slides, both stamps and slides were stored at 4°C
2015.03.25
Experimental/Protocol:
Slides from fridge were sandwiched with 80 µL BSA-solution in PBS-buffer (10 mg/mL)
Slides were incubated for 30 min
After separation slides were cleaned with aqua dest.
Dried with wafergun
Slide-sandwiches with 80 µL Streptavidin-Cy5-solution (0.5 µg/mL) per sandwich
Incubated in petri dish for 30 min with tissue over petri dish
After separtion slides were put into aqua dest.
Dried with wafergun

Remarks
When incubating the stamps with protein solution, immediately restore unused stamp material in order to protect it from dust!
When stamping do not leave the stamp longer than 5-10 s (maximum 30 s) on surface.
Weak intensities of fluorescence might be due to slow preparation of slides.
Questions and Tasks
Be faster during cleaning processes!
