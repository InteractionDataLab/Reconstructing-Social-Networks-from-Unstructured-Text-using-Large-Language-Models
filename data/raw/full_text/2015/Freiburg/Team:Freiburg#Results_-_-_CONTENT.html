      Our aim was to develop a novel diagnostic tool enabling fast, simultaneous and label-free detection of antibodies in human blood sera. We successfully generated our self-established <A href="#own_mix">cell-free expression system</A> based on an <I>E. coli</I> lysate, which revealed an expression efficiency comparable to a commercial kit. To immobilize the expressed proteins, we established a <A href="#specific_surfaces">surface</A> that specifically binds our target proteins. 
Combined in a microfluidic chamber we produced a protein array that can be flushed with a serum sample Label-free detection of antigen-antibody binding can be done in real-time by the interferometric method called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference).  Finally we <A href="#device_results_anchor">built our own detection device</A> in a simplified and cost-efficient manner and thus, making it available for future iGEM Teams.
      Using the DiaCHIP, we did not only show the presence of antibodies in distinct solutions but also verified them in complex samples as human blood serum.

To test the DiaCHIP under real-life conditions, we analysed the blood serum of a person that has been immunized against tetanus for the presence of anti-tetanus antibodies. First we confirmed the binding of antibodies present in the blood to our purified tetanus antigen by ELISA. Then we spotted the antigen and GFP, which both were expressed in E.coli and purified by His-tag affinity purification, on a PDITC surface. The much stronger binding of blood components to the tetanus antigen spots compared to GFP spots indicates specific interactions. By confirming that the bound blood components are human antibodies with anti-human, we successfully demonstrated that we are able to detect antibody binding even in complex samples.

     The <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1621003" target="_blank">antigen</A> used for detection of anti-tetanus antibodies is derived from the tetanus neurotoxin and commonly used for <I>in vitro</I> testing. For preparation of the DiaCHIP, this antigen had to be overexpressed in <I>E. coli</I> and purified from whole cell lysate. To verify the successful purification of the antigen, Western Blot analysis was performed (figure 2). The usage of an antibody against the N-terminal His-tag revealed a protein with a molecular weight of about 50 kDa. This correlates with the expected molecular weight of the antigen <SUP><A class="fn_top" href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" name="fnt__1">1)</A></SUP>. </P><DIV class="image_box right"><DIV class="thumb2 trien" style="width:250px"><DIV class="thumbinner"><P><STRONG>Figure 3: ELISA for the tetanus antigen with blood samples taken after the immunization.</STRONG> The graph shows the absorption over time for TMB.

Therefore, we spotted tetanus antigen and bBSA of the same concentration (12.5 µg/mL) and 2 times PBS as negative controls. The tetanus antigen and one PBS well were incubated with 5 mg/mL BSA, blood serum, and HRP-labeled anti-human for 1 h, respectively. The bBSA and the other PBS well were incubated with HRP-labeled Streptavidin (0.5 µg/mL) for 1  h (positive control). After each step the wells were washed with PBS. To visualize the binding, Tetramethylbenzidine was added and the absorption at 650 nm was measured in a plate reader over time (figure 3). The absorption signal for tetanus is even higher than the positive control, which illustrates the successful binding of antibodies from the blood to tetanus antigen.

        After the validation of the antigen antibody binding for tetanus by ELISA we wanted to see if we can detect this interaction also with iRIf. Therefore we first expressed our <I>Clostridium tetani</I> antigen and GFP in <I>E.coli</I>. The purified <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/DNA_Engineering#detailed_cloning_anchor">His-tagged</A> proteins then were spotted on a PDITC surface. The slide with the immobilized proteins was flushed with human blood serum, and anti-human antibody. Strong binding was detected for the tetanus antigen spots, while the GFP spots only exhibited minimal binding (see figure 1A-D). This indicates that components contained in the blood serum bind specifically to the tetanus antigen. The subsequent binding of anti-human antibody to the tetanus antigen spots (figure 4) confirms the presents and binding of human antibodies to the spotted tetanus antigens. These results successfully demonstrate that it is possible to detect the binding of antibodies from blood serum to antigens immobilized, on a surface.

       With an additional experiment we wanted to see if we can differentiate the vaccination status of patients with our system. Therefore we used blood serum samples, taken before and two weeks after immunization against tetanus. A slide with immobilized tetanus antigen and GFP was prepared (figure 5). It was consecutively flushed with both blood sera.  The blood serum taken after vaccination exhibits a much more intense binding to the tetanus spot than the serum taken before binding. Unfortunately we did not had enough anti-human antibody to proof further the presents of bound human antibodies from blood serum.</P><DIV class="image_box left"><DIV class="thumb2 trien" style="width:300px"><DIV class="thumbinner"><P><STRONG>Figure 6: Quotient pictures of slides flushed with blood serum taken before and after vaccination.</STRONG> (A) Schematic pattern of proteins immobilized on a glass slide.

We were still able to detect binding of both blood sera to the tetanus antigen, but no difference in binding intensity was visible. To test the assumption that the used blood was not fresh enough and therefore lost some of its binding capabilities a fresh blood sample five weeks after vaccination was taken for the experiment (See figure 6B and C).   
To determine whether the identification of the vaccination status is possible with our system further experimentation needs to be done.

an iRIf measurement: Antibodies against GFP are flushed over the slide to 

detect GFP that is bound to the slide. The specific binding of anti-GFP 

antibodies to the control spot (purified GFP) and the cellfree expressed GFP

      Commercial systems using the iRIf technology (imaging Reflectomretric 

Interference) are mostly bulky and expensive machines even though the 

components they are based on are rather simple. So we decided on building 

our own device consisting of not much more than two lenses, an LED and a 

camera. With this system we were able to reliably detect the binding of 

anti-GFP to GFP, thus confirming a detection sensitivity in the range of 

protein-protein interactions. To enable future iGEM Teams to profit from 

this device as we did, we provide all plans and parts necessary to rebuild 

it on this website for everyone to download and use.<A class="details_box_trigger" href="#details_box-3">▼ Detailed

      To test our device we aimed at reproducing measurements that we were 

previously able to perform in our commercial device. For this reason we 

focused on using two antibodies: anti-GFP and polyclonal anti-rabbit. GFP 

and rabbit derived anti-HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) antibody were used as 

antigens in this experiment. Note that the anti-HCV antibody only served as 

binding partners for the anti-rabbit antibodies, since no HCV proteins were 

used in this experiment.
      The antigens were spotted onto an iRIf slide with an APTES/PDITC 

surface. The spots on the slide were produced by pipetting 3.5 µl [1 mg/ml] 

rabbit-anti-HCV protein and 3.5 µl [1 mg/ml] GFP onto the slide and 

incubated overnight. After incubation the slide was blocked for 30 min in 

BSA solution.

      A Canon 50D camera was used to record the measurement and was set to 

take one picture every 5 seconds. The exposure time was set in order for the 

pixels in the image to be approx. 80% of maximum light saturation before the 

solution was flushed onto the chip.

      The antibody solutions were pipetted into the flow-chamber without the 

use of any microfluidic device. Instead, a syringe was loaded with 660 µl [5 

µg/ml] anti-GFP antibody solution (diluted in PBS) and connected to the 

input pipe of our device. The content of the syringe was then slowly 

released via this pipe into the chamber of the device by gently dispensing 

the solution from the syringe. When the whole volume was run over the chip, 

the process was repeated with 660 µl [5 µg/ml] anti-rabbit antibody solution 

in the same way. The injection of both solutions was performed during 

approximately 45 minutes.

      Video 1 shows the results of the measurement. Both, binding of anti-

GFP and anti-rabbit to the corresponding antigen spots, could be observed. 

Due to the fact that the experiment was performed on our DiaCHIP device 

which was built with a transparent casing, fluctuations in surrounding light 

had a strong, detrimental influence on the measurement quality. To minimize 

the influence of the unstable surrounding light, the resulting pictures had 

to be averaged over 10 pictures each. This in turn led to a more stable 

light situation, however the signal strength dropped as a consequence. 

Figure 3 shows a quotient picture of the measurement where the light 

situation was temporarily appropriate. The problem of surrounding light 

scattering into the device can of course be overcome using a non-transparent 

casing. An evaluation of how well our device performs in comparison with the 

professional device was not performed, mainly due to time constraints. 

However our results hint that we get comparable results for strong binding 

such as GFP/anti-GFP, as can be seen in figure 4.

      Since there are a variety of proteins present in the cell-free mix a 

specific surface on the future protein array is essential. That is why we 

established our Ni-NTA surface for the immobilization of the antigens on the 

chip. All expression constructs contain a His-tag fused to the coding 

sequence, resulting in antigens that can bind specifically to our Ni-NTA 

surface. Compared to an unspecific surface (PDITC) we could show that this 

Ni-NTA surface allows efficient binding of the target protein and prevents 

unspecific binding of other proteins that are present in the cell-free mix 

(figure 1).

      For cell-free protein expression lots of different proteins, like 

RNA-polymerases, ribosomes and other <I>E. coli</I> proteins are essential. 

During the process of cell-free expression all these proteins are, besides 

the target protein, also present in the microfluidic chamber. To have a 

sufficient amount of target protein immobilized on the chip we established a 

specific surface chemistry on the glass slide. After testing several <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results/Surface">tag systems</A> we 

established a Ni-NTA surface. Using a Ni-NTA covered glass slide (figure 1) 

we could increase the amount of bound cell-free expressed His-GFP compared 

to an unspecific surface (figure 2). In both experiments 1.5 µg of self 

purified GFP-His was used as positive control. The cell-free expression mix 

without DNA is supposed to result in no target protein and served as 

negative control. The cell-free reactions were performed for 2 hours at 37°C 

in a seperate tube prior to pipetting the samples by hand onto the surfaces 

and incubated on the slide overnight. Before measurment in the iRIf device, 

the optical detection method we use, the slides were blocked with BSA and 

then flushed with anti-GFP antibodies. An increase in light intensity where 

the spotted protein was located represents a binding event. Due to less 

unspecific binding of proteins to the surface, the interaction of anti-GFP 

antibodies with cell-free expressed His-GFP is higher on the Ni-NTA surface.

        A key feature of our DiaCHIP is the on-demand antigen production via 

cell-free expression. Thereby, a fixed DNA template is copied into our 

desired antigen, which in turn can bind to our specific surface. Our 

expression mix called DiaMIX was established from scratch. It is based on an 

<I>E. coli</I> lysate. In a direct comparison with a commercial product our 

mix showed comparable expression rates, indicating its performance 

capability (figure 1).

        Our DiaMIX is a complex system consisting of several individually 

adjusted components that allow us to make use of the cells own production 

system, without the tedious drawbacks of normal cell-based protein 

expression.
As a main component of the DiaMIX the <I>E. coli</I> lysate contains the 

necessary transcription and translation apperatus. The lysate is 

complemented by additives needed for energy regeneration, buffering, and 

generation of the protein. An overview of cell-free expression systems and 

its components can be found on our <A class="”wikilink1”" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/Cellfree_Expression">project 

pages</A>. 
        As ultimate evaluation, we compared the DiaMIX to a commercial kit 

as seen in figure 1. </P><P> 
        Both expression systems successfully expressed the applied 

vector.
        Furthermore, the cell-free expression of GFP with our cell-free mix 

could be verified in an <A class="wikilink1" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results#agfp_results" title="agfp_results">iRIf measurement</A>. 
        To obtain these final results, a lot of optimization and testing had 

to be done. Want to know more about how we established the DiaMIX? You can

      For establishing our device, we optimized all steps from the 

immobilization of DNA on the silicone of the flow-chamber to the specific 

binding of the target proteins on the glass slide. This way, we generated 

protein arrays we can use to detect different antibodies in human and rabbit 

serum with the iRIf detection method.  Click on the images below to
