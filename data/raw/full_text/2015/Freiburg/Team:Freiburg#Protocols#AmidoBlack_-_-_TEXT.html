Amido black assay
Protein concentration Amido black assay
material: Amido black solution: 10% (v/v)Acectic acid, 90% (v/v)MeOH, 0.05% (v/v) Amido black; Destain: 90% (v/v)EtoH; 10% (v/v) Acetic acid …
duration: 1h
transfer 20ul of protein extract into new Eppendorf tubes; pipet samples for the calibration curve (see table 1)
add 1 ml amido black solution; vortex
centrifuge for 15 min at max. speed, RT
discard supernatant
add 1 ml destain solution
mix by inversion
centrifuge for 15 min at max. speed, RT
discard supernatant
air-dry the pellet (takes about 15 min)
add 1ml 0.2 M NaOH; vortex
transfer the samplkes to disposable cuvettes
measure the OD620
calculate the concentration of your protein samples
