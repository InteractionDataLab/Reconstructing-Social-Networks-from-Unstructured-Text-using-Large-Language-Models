competent cells (new)
e.g. protocol for DNA-isolation
remarks concerning the protocol (author, adapted from etc.)
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: … min
Protocol
streak out E. coli cell on LB plate without (or with appropriate antibiotics), grow over night at 37°C
inocculate 5 ml o/n culture with one colony
inocculate 100 ml LB with 1 ml o/n culture, grow for 2-3 h until an OD(600)=0,4 to 0,6
transfer bacteria into pre-cooled and sterile centrifuge tube (250 ml) and pellet bacteria 5 min (5000 rpm; 4°C)
discard supernatant
from now on: work in cold room
resuspend pellet in 20 ml cold TFB1 with cut tips
incubate 5 min on ice
centrifuge 5 min (5000 rpm; 4°C)
resuspend pellet in 4 ml cold TFB2 with cut tips
aliquot 50 ml in screw cap eppis and freeze in liquid nitrogen
store at -80°C
