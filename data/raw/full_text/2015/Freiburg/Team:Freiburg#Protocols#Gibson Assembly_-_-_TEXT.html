Gibson Assembly
Gibson Assembly is rather novel method for assembling DNA fragments with overlapping overhangs. The operating mode of this method is devided into three major parts:
An exonuclease removes bases from the 5' end of each DNA strand.
Complementary regions of different DNA strands can anneal and a polymerase fills up the gaps.
The fragments are ligated together.
To enable these three steps, DNA strands with compatible ends of about 32 bp are needed. Those can either be incorporated by primer overhangs or by gene synthesis.
A 5 µl mix of the DNA parts that are supposed to be assembled is prepared. Its composition is calculated based on the length and concentration of every single fragment. The insert(s) should at least be contained in a 4 - 8 fold molar amount of the antibiotic resistance containing backbone.
Assembly of DNA fragments with overlapping regions
(adapted from AG Weber protocol)
Material: Gibson Master Mix Aliquots
Time: 90 min
Prepare 5 µl of DNA-Mix (calculate voulumes using the equations below or use the prepared worksheet .
Add the DNA Mix to Gibson Master Mix.
Incubate for 5 min at RT.
Use 5 - 7 µl for transformation of competent E.coli cells.
Calculation of the DNA mix
Backbone:
V (Bb) = 12 ng/kb * l (Bb) / c (Bb)
Insert(s):
V (Ins) = 12 ng/kb * l (Ins) * X / c (Ins)
X = Ratio Insert to Backbone
for example: X = 4, if Ins : Bb = 4 : 1
