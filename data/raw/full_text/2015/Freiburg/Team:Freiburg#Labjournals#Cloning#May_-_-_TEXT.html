Ligation of self-build cloning site into pSBA3 (LS)
aim of this ligation is to get our constructs into pSB1A3, so that they can be expressed more easily
to distinguish between constructs in pSB1C3 and pSB1A3, those with the Amp- resistence will have an „A“ added after their name

Gibson for pIG15_403: checking plates (LS)
lots of clones on the plates
picked 8 clones
incubation at 37°C in LB-Clm for ~8h (shaking)
Ligation: checking plates (LS)
some clones on the ligation plates
nothing on the ligation control plate :)
picked 8 clones each (pIG15_803-8-A + pIG15_002-A)
incubation in LB-Amp at 37°C for ~8 h (shaking)
Miniprep: all clones from Gibson plate (pIG15_403) and ligation plates (LS)

Test digest: HindIII + PstI
20µl digest, incubated at 37°C for 1h
agarose-gel: nothing but smears…
finally found out the reason: There was no RnaseA in buffer 1 of the biozym miniprep kit
miniprep will be repeated tomorrow, test digest as well
