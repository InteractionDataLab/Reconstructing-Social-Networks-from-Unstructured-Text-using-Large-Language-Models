Experiment 12: Optimisation of blocking and first use of PDMS spotting templates
protocols used : Plasma activation , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking
2015.05.28
considerations
Try new washing and blocking step. Also use PDMS spotting mask for the first time.
Experiment/Protocol
Made 8 APTES/PDITC slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Use of 4 GOPTS slides from 26.5.2015 to test binding with reduced reaction agressivity of stored GOPTS-slides
Spotted 4 GOPTS and 4 APTES/PDITC slides as in Spotting+Blocking
one GOPTS and APTES/PDITC slide each was spotted using the PDMS spotting help
one GOPTS and APTES/PDITC slide each was incubated over night with GFP
Results
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces
Fluorescence intensity on PDITC highest at 500 µg/ml GFP
Fluorescence intensity on GOPTS highest at 1680 µg/ml GFP
Fluorescence intensity for overnight incubation slightly higher
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on GOPTS surfaces with shutterspeed of 1s and normalised shutterspeed of 4s
Intensity values should not differ but they do→ further investigate
Influence of PDMS spotting help on mean GFP fluorescence spot intensity on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces
PDMS spotting help useful on PDITC
Experiment 11: First fluorescence intensity/shutterspeed linearity test
2015.05.26
spotted a drop of undiluted GFP on a normal glass slide
measured fluorescence intensity with fluorescence microscope with varying shutterspeed
Results
Fluorescence Intensities measured with varying shutterspeed
Experiment 10: GOPTS slides for storage
2015.05.26
considerations
GOPTS-surface may be to agressive for GFP → storage of activated slides may reduce agressivity and allow binding of active GFP
Experiment/Protocol
Made 8 slides using standard GOPTS-Protocol
stored slides in slideholder at 4°C
Experiment 9: GFP on activated slides (VWR Slides)
2015.05.25
considerations
Because diamond writer is still defect and using scissors isn't that efficient slides weren't labeled this time. Processing took place in different petri dishes taht were labeled on the top to avoid confusion.
The same conditions as in Experiment 8 were used, but slides from VWR were activated instead of the ROTH slides from AG Roth.
Experiment / Protocol
activation
5 slides were cleaned with acetone, isoprop and water
4 of these slides were activated (→ protocol , 2min, 80 L/h)
1 slide was stored for later use  as control
of the 4 activated slides:
2 were further processed using GOPTS-Protocol
80 µL GOPTS-Solution, sandwich, 1h, RT
incubate 30 sec in acetone
wash in acetone
blow dry and store at 4°C
2 were coated with APTES + PDITC surface
APTES-solution, 30 min, RT
2 x 5 min Acetone
blow dry
45 min, 110°C (15 min too long → 60 min)
2h in PDITC solution
Use the mixing vessels provided by AG Roth for APTES- and PDITC-solution!
Afterwards wash with the respective solvent (Acetone in case of APTES and DMF in case of PDITC)
spotting
Spotting according to the following pattern:
Spotting model. green: GFP 500 µg/mL, yellow: GFP 1000 µg/mL, red: GFP 1680 µg/mL, violet: Strep-Cy5 25 µg/mL, blue: BSA 10 mg/mL
Spotted slides were incubated for 1h at RT in dark environment and humid conditions (wet towels).
Detection
Remarks
Use 4 slides per condition next time to have at minimum triplicates for evaluation!
Experiment 8: GFP on activated slides (Roth Slides)
2015.05.24
considerations
Use of short names because diamond writer was defect. Slide naming was changed to increasing indices per operator to avoid the need to look up the numbering every time.

Experiment / Protocol
Slide activation
All slides were activated according to protocol
Flow: 80 L/h
Time: 2 min
I and II were activated using the standard GOPTS-Protocol
III and IV: Standard APTES + PDITC activation
V and VI were first activated, incubated in petri dish and activated again right before spotting
Spotting
on each slide from left (side with slide name) to right the following three spot columns were spottet:
1:200 GFP 1,58 mg/mL
1:100
1:50
1:10 (far right, spottet as two sport vertical and one right from the highest)
slides were incuzbated in humid condition for 1 h
