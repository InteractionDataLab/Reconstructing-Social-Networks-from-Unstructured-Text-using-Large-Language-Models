Desalting using BioRad desalting columns
material: Lysis buffer , aqua dest, 20% EtOH
duration: 1h
equlibration
put columns on a falcon labeled 'waste'
clean columns from EtOH by washing 4-5 times with 5 mL of aqua dest
equilibrate with the same amount of lysis buffer
let buffer flush into the column and close just before column starts to run dry
loading
add 2.5 mL of protein solution
let again just flow into the column
Change the falcon to a new one in which the actual elution should take place
repeat the following step 3 times
pour 2mL of lysis buffer on the column and collect the flow-through (just when solution is flushed in)
cleaning
clean the column by washing 4-5 times with aqua dest for storage or lysis buffer for further use
for storage: equilibrate the column with 2-3 times with 20% EtOH solution and store @ 4Â°C
