Ni-NTA
Surface functionalization of GOPTS & PDITC with Ni-chelated NTA
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: … min
Surface preparation
prepare 80 µL 457 mM AB-NTA, 1 M NaHCO3 solution per slide sandwich
use 0.06 g N,N-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-Lysine-hydrate and 0.042 g NaHCO3 in 500 µL aqua dest
use 0.096 g N,N-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-Lysine-hydrate and 0.067 g NaHCO3 in 800 µL aqua dest
use 0.108 g N,N-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-Lysine-hydrate and 0.076 g NaHCO3 in 900 µL aqua dest
put 80 µL on one slide and put the other one upon → Make sure the upper sides were laid together
incubate o/n
prepare blocking solutions:
blocking solution for GOPTS: 10mg/ml BSA + 0.5% ethanolamine in PBS
blocking solution for APTES/PDITC:5mg/ml BSA + 5% ethanolamine in PBS
transfer slides into blocking solution for 30 min-60 min
2x wash slides for 10 min in PBS (shake it)
prepare 20 mL 1 % (w/v) NiSO4 solution per 5 slides (= 0.2 g/20 mL)
incubate slides in slide holder with nickel sulfate for 1 h
2x wash slides for 10 min in PBS (shake it)
prepare 1/10 PBS-dilution in aqua dest and check for pH (should be 7-8)
wash slides in diluted PBS-solution
Dry slides with wafer gun
Spotting and washing
spot using 11-spot mask
incubate o/n @ 4°C
remove protein solution with pipette
incubate 5 min with 10 mg/mL BSA solution in the wells
transfer slide into PBS solution and remove mask
wash 2x 10 min in PBS
prepare PBS 1/10 dilution (with 20 mM Imidazol, 27.2 mg in 20 mL PBS)
wash 10 min in 1/10 diluted PBS
dry with wafer gun
measure fluorescence
incubate for 45 min in Strep-Cy5 solution (2µg/ml)+ 5-10mg/ml BSA
2x wash 10 min in PBS (shake it)
wash 10 min in 1/10 diluted PBS
dry with wafer gun
measure Cy5-fluorescence in microarray scanner
