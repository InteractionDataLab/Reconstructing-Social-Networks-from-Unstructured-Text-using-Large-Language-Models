Slide 254: binding curves
→ the detection of GFP-, rabbit-, and mouse antibodies worked on all three slides
→ the increase in protein concentration of the spotted antigens on slide 254 does not lead to a increase of the detection signal → surface is with a protein concentration of 500 µg/ml already saturated

→ Binding of the anti-his antibody to the antigen (rhErbB2/Fc) was detected→ the (His tagged) antigen was immobilized on the surface
→ no binding of the affibody to its antigen couold be detected → either the affibody does not bind strong enough or the affibody is too small (~8 kDa) to generate a sufficient iRIf signal

Slide 466: flushed with Serum (-) diluted 1:30 in BSA
Results
serum (-) 1:20 dilution:
Slide 303: Quotion picture
Slide 303: binding curves
→ strong binding to the salmonella antigen was detected → SIG 002 could also experienced a previous salmonella infection. Signal overall was quite weak.
serum (-) 1:30 dilution:
Slide 466: Quotion picture
Slide 466: binding curves
→the 1:30 diluted serum(-) shows little unspecific binding → weak binding to tetanus antigen could be caused by low anti tetanus antibody titer from previous vaccination
→overall weak signal, reuslts rather inconsistent→ use new stock of blood serum for previous experiments

Results
PBS:
Slide 208: Quotion picture

TBS:
Slide 216: Quotion picture
Slide 216: binding curves

→ only very weak or no Salmonella antigen/antibody binding detectable, probably due to old salmonella antigen and antibody stocks
Salmonella Lysate:
Slide 500: Quotion picture
Slide 500: binding curves
→ much unspecific binding detected, probably due to binding of E. coli proteins of the salmonella antibody lysate to other E. coli proteins still present in the purified mCherry and salmonella antigen (both were expressed in E. coli)

Results
Serum (-):
Slide 024: Quotion picture
Slide 024: binding curves
Slide 287: ROI selection
Slide 287: binding curves
→ slide 024 shows low unspecific binding due to 1:30 dilution of the serum(-), slide 287 shows high unspecific binding due to the 1:10 dilution of the serum(-)
→overall signal much weaker than before, probably due to repeated freezing of the blood serum
Serum (+):
Slide 426: ROI selection
Slide 426: binding curves
Slide 433: ROI selection

→slide 426 shows relativly weak unspecific binding and moderate binding of proteins to the Tetanus antigen, slide 433 has more unspecific binding

429 was not measured because the other slides showed that GFP was expressed, so the Experiment will be repeated and the above mentioned mistake (removal of spotting masks after 37 °C incubation) will be avoided.
Results
Only slide 500 was evaluated. Slide 424 and 429 showed very bad surface during measurements which was wiped off → Difficult to evaluate Slide 500: spots 4 and 8 had to be excluded from evaluation.

Flow cells were then washed with aqua dest. and dried with wafergun
Expression was effected for 20, 40 and 130 min with AG Roth expression mix at 37°C (not sealed, no humid atmosphere)
flow cells were checked for fluorescence in microscope of AG Eimer
afterwards flow cells were washed with 2 ml PBS and aqua dest. and thene dried with wafergun
stored in petri dish sealed with parafilm at 4°C
Results
Expression of our GFP conctruct and the control construct could be observed on both flow cells
Expressed GFP seems to diffuse with the time. This might be due to the transport of the slides from the incubator to the microscope and back.

Slide 424: Binding curves
The relative intensity shift for the three approaches (Serum(-)Serum(+) on Ni-NTA ; Serum(-)Serum(+) on PDITC; Serum(-)a-GFP on Ni-NTA) were compared. As expected and seen in the binding curves cellfree expression Mix (His-GFP) shows no signal on PDITC (other proteins within the mix bind to the surface) but on specific Ni-NTA surface. Taken amount of serum performs less (2-3 fold) than 3 ug/ml a-GFP.
Evaluation of the relative intensity shift. From left to right spot 1-11. For each spot rel. intensity shift is plotted with bars for Serum(-)flush and Serum(+)/a-GFP

Results
Slide 24: Selection of ROIs: 1 HIV spot (spot 2) and one HCV spot (spot 3) were excluded due to high amounts of salt on it
Slide 24: Binding curves
Slide 502: Selection of ROIs
Slide 502: Binding curves for all spots
Slide 502: Binding curve (second Salmonella spot excluded)
Results: We have specific antibody/antigen binding for Salmonella! (a-HIV/HCV do not bind…)  Slide 502: During measurement within the first buffer step/blocking step most of the second Salmonella spot was washed away. Related to this the spot behaves strange. Slide 24: Also anti-salmonella lysate was tested. Here we see (as expected) stronger unspecific binding at other spots (nevertheless greatest binding for the salmonella spots). The unspecific/transient binding proteins get mostly washed away during the following buffer step.

protocols used : Plasma activation , [[protocols:irif_slide_preparation|iRIf slide preparation] ]
Considerations
prepare 4 iRIf PDTIC slides for measurement
spot antibodies that shall be detected with antigens (opposite to Exp 37a) on 2 slides

Experiment/Protocol
4 PDITC iRIf slides were prepared according to protocol
plasma activation for 5 min at 80 L/h
slides were incubated in APTES for 45 min
slides were incubated in PDITC for 2 h, washed with Ethanol and Acetone and stored in the desiccator for 40 min
3µL of the Antibodies for HIV, HCV, Tetanus and Salmonella + controls (GFP, bBSA) were spotted

Experiment/protocol
spots were blocked 2x with 10 mg/mL BSA for 5 min
slide was blocked in 10 mg/mL in BSA for 30 min
slides were washed 1x with ddH2O
slides were measured in iRIf
Measurement
Only 1 slide was measured. Second slide syringe didnt suck solutions.

Results
Antigens didn't bind to the immobilized antibodies, anti-mouse only bound to a-Tetanus spot, and not to a-HIV and a-HCV spots, even though they are from mice, too.
