Digest of pET_803 (LS)
After sequencing confirmed that we have the correct pET_803 vector (=pET_iGEM with antigen 8 (HSV1) with C-term His-tag), pET_308 was digested with BamHI and HindIII to excise the antigen. Afterwards other antigens can be inserted.

Digest of pET_803 (RE)
Yesterday's digest of pET_803 had to be repeated again. Gel runs of CellfEx confirmed that the exchange of the running buffer was sufficient to solve yesterday's problems.
Since a lot of backbone of pET_803 is needed for ligation with all the antigens the digest was performed in a larger scale.

Miniprep of pET_804 ligation clones(LS)
Ligation of pET_iGEM (digested BamHI + AflII) with antigen 8 (HSV1/ digested with BamHI + AflII) was done two days before. Clones were picked from the clones and inoculated in liquid culture. Miniprep of the liquid cultures was performed to further analyse the plasmid via test-digest.

Digest of aniges 10 (Hepatitis), 11(Tetanus) and 17(HIV) (LS)
The antigenes 10, 11 and 17 were the first to be digested with BamHI and HindIII, because we already have the respective antibodies for further experiments. The antigens were digested out of pJET. Each antigen was digested 3 times, therefore a 10x MasterMix was prepared.

Ligation of digested pET_803 backbone with digested antigens (LS)
To be able to express different antigens with a His-tag, the digested antigen 10 (Hepatitis), 11 (Tetanus) and 17 (HIV) are ligated in the pET_803 backbone. The pET_803 backbone still has the His-tag while the antigen 8 (HSV1) is excised.

Inocculation of 4 clones from each ligation (antigens 10, 11 and 17) (RE)
The ligation worked good. Some colonies visible on the ligation control plate, but far more on the ligation plates.
4 single colonies were picked from each plate. Successful ligation will be verified by test digest after mini-prepping the different clones.

comment:
PCR for fragment 804 with overhangs for Gibson assembly in pET did not work and will be repeated with less template
PCR  – “ – in pIG15: the wrong template was used, it has to be pJet_804!
Repetition of the PCRs for fragment 804 (RE)
PCRs were performed as before with the following changes:
pET: only 0.4 µl template were used (instead of 0.6 µl)
pIG: pJet_804 was used as template (instead of pIG15_104)
analysis on 1 % agarose gel: successful amplification of the 500 bp fragment in both cases –> extracted
