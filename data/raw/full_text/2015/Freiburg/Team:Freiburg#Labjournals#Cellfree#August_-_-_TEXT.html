3fold master mix was prepared and divided into 3 PCR tubes
cycling conditions were chosen according to the lab journal entry from 16.8.15 (Luisa)
PCR product was cleaned-up with the PCR purification kit from Qiagen
result: ~60 µl DNA with a concentration of 66.1 ng/µl
10 µl of the PCR product were analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel: amplification of GFP was successful (image could not be saved due to the scanner)

Expression of HA-GFP-His6-His6 on NiNTA slide
(Luisa)
HA-GFP-His6-His6 was expressed in 15 µl reactions
2 reactions were performed as usual in a 1.5 ml tube
6 reactions were performed by using a mastermix on a NiNTA slide in spots (2 slides with 3 reactions each)
4 reactions were performed without DNA on a NiNTA slide in spots (2 slides with 2 reactions each)
all samples were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C with the slide being covered by parafilm instead of a microsope slide
after expression the slides will be incubated at 4°C over night and then measured in the iRIf
for more results please refer to SurChem lab journal

Expression of HA-GFP-His6-His6 on NiNTA slide
(Luisa)
HA-GFP-His6-His6 was expressed in 15 µl reactions
2 reactions were performed as usual in a 1.5 ml tube
6 reactions were performed by using a mastermix on a NiNTA slide in spots (2 slides with 3 reactions each)
4 reactions were performed without DNA on a NiNTA slide in spots (2 slides with 2 reactions each)
all samples were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C with the slide being covered by a regular microscope slide
after expression the slides will be incubated at 4°C over night and then measured in the iRIf
for more results please refer to SurChem lab journal
when removing the microsope slide, the spots converged. The iRIf measurement will be performed anyway, but the entire experiment is repeated for distinct spots.

finally came round to repeat critizised experiment
20 µl rx's
800 ng pBESTluc DNA (=2000 ng/50µl)
variation from 12 mM to 16 mM of MgOAc, as first experiment suggested 14 mM to be the optimum

Considerations
choosing smaller rx's was needed because of lack of luciferase assay reagent
new luciferase assay reagent AGAIN full of fungi, even after sterile filtering and storage at - 20°
very small pipeting steps between Mg-concentrations: 0,24µl - 0,26µl - 0,28µl - 0,30µl - 0,32µl –> high error quote possible
Results
results have been very inaccurate/ have high errors and do not confirm the findings of the first experiment.
i blame the small rx size and therefore very small pipeting volumes for the errors.
probably another repetition is needed

overlaying reactions with 25µl of mineral oil (because Normann said so)
expression in platereader at 37° for 1:30h
fluorescence measurement every 2min
in 384 well plate, transparent, square bottom
added a few measurements after 1:30h because Koko's still looked like it was expressing
RESULTS
Roths don't know their GFP concentrations, so positive control is kinda worthless. Higher curve was green GFP, so probably very high concentrated; other one „1:9“ of unkown start concentration.
Roths Kit is expressing their own linear template in an extreme amount very fast, but nothing else:
circular DNA did not work in Roth's Kit at all
linear DNA did not work in Koko's Kit
very slow expression in Koko's Kit. After 1:30 only at less then 1/10th of usual sample emission values (about 8000-9000 in other experiments)
plasmid DNA is known to express better than linear templates, so why doesn't it work in Roth's Kit at all?
mineral oil still sucks because its harming the reaction, or is at least quenching emission values.
Cellfree expression on NiNTA
3 samples with HA-GFP-His6-His6 DNA (2000 ng in 15 µl) and 3 samples without DNA were spotted on a slide with spotting mask

Maxiprep of HA-GFP-His6-His6 and pBEStluc
2 x 250 ml were incubated over night
Kinetic assay for cellfree expression of luciferase
3 assays were performed by adding luciferin and dilution reagent (25 µl) to 25 µl reactions in a white 96 well plate
measurements were taken every two minutes for 20 minutes (A1/B1 = measurement after 0 minutes of expression, A2/B2 = measurement after 2 minutes of expression, …)
samples were measured for 116 sec
triplicates A, B & C were measured by storing B and C on ice while measuring A (Premix and DNA were added just before measurement)
measurement of C was unreasonably noisy

Expression of HA-GFP-His6-His6
50µl reaction of complete Koko-system
using the evaluated best-working DNA concentration of 2 µg (see 08.08.)
using the evaluated best-working MgOAc-concentration of 14mM (see 10.08)
2h, 37°C, 0rpm
planned to use for:
spotting the finished expression onto Ni-NTA slides in collaboration with SurChem subgroup, to check for working immobilization of the tagged GFP
WesternBlot to confirm correct expression
Repetition of MgOAc-variation in Bernhard-Koko system from Mon, 10.08.
this time using the right concentrations, otherwise exactly the same
Results:
system completely dead, no expression
–> Bernhard mix does not, as promised, work best between 15 and 18mM.
other explanation: our stock of MgOAc is unknowingly slightly higher concentrated than we think it is

Variation of start-concentration of MgOAc(Koko)
in both Bernhard+Koko and complete Koko for further improvement of reaction conditions
Bernhard once said his system was optimal in the range of 15-18mM.
no further feeding of the mix.
2h, 37°C, 0rpm
4µg of pBESTluc DNA to compare expression via Luciferase assay later on
a terrible mistake was made while pipeting the B-K reaction (using 1M stock of MgOAc instead of 10µM to adjust molarity)
first one was not (falsely) adjusted (= 11mM)–> visible maximum
–> will be repeated (see 12.08.)
Results:
Dot Blot and Western Blot of Expressionfrom today (105):(Sabi)
before measuring in platereader: 10 µl of reaction were passed on to SurChem
15µl were used for measurement in platereader
the remaining 25 µl were mixed with 7 µl 5X SDS sample buffer and heated too 99°C for 15 min
2µl of the samples were spotted for a Dot Blot on activated PVDF
After measurement in the platereader 2 µl of the reaction mix that were spotted as well (without SDS)
for the Western Blot 25µl sample were used
Pippetting sheme: Marker-no DnA-K/K-K/K+feed-B/K-B/K+feed
gel run for 1,5 h at 0,03 A but looked slightly strange –> SDS sample buffer might be invested with foreign proteins
in the biginning gel rumn very slow only on centimeter in an hour. Probably due to the missing second balance glass plate. Glass plate was attached and the run started again
blotting at 0,14A for 1,5 h with the small blotting apperature
whole marker was on the membrane and a little bit on the Whatman behind –> no further increase of Ampere
blocking in TBS-T with 5% milkpowder oN at 4°C

clear spots with KK+ /KK- –> However in the platereader B performed better
only natural spotted expression mix shows clear signal –> perhaps due to differnt amount of proteins, as indicated by the ponceau staining

Results
highest expression for DNA=2µg
negative control showed signal higher than 1µg, which suggests errors in pipeting or mix up of data.
Experiment was repeated with triplicates on 13.08.15

white plates
remeasurement with black plates and see-through plates
no big difference between those kinds of plates. however white plaes increase the signal and gives a distorted picture of reality.
for example were the negative controls over 20000 relative fluorecence units
never use white plate for fluorecence

Comassie of Western Blot
next time gel should be run at increased Ampère. In the applied running time, the bands didn't separate well
perhaps a change of gel concentration would be beneficial as well
Ponceau staining of western membranes
Dot blot shows some clear protein spots
not a lot of protein is visible in the lines of the western blot
some of the samples weren't visible at all –> repeat of western necessary → preparation of bigger samples necessary
Western blot(transmitted light picture; EcL-Picture[3 min]; picture of arrangement taken with camera

Anti-GFP shows bands in the lane of B+P –> however bands are at 15kDa it should be at 27kDa

test HA-GFP-His6-His6 PCR from yesterday by loading 20 µl to a gel
gel control of pIG15_105 PCR from yesterday
purification of pIG15_105 PCR (Sabi):
elution in:  12,5 ul on 2 columns
concentration: 950 ng/µl
Western Blot of expression of pIG15_105 and HA-GFP-His6-His6 from today:
big 12 % SDS Gel with Collecting gel was cast ( next time use of red comb!)
24 ul of the GFP samples and negative controls were mixed with 6ul SDS 5X running buffer and heated to 95 °C for 10 min
for Luc samples: due to not enough sample after back and forth pipetting on the plate only 20 µl sample were used
15 ul of the samples were put onto the blot. However pipetting was quite difficult due to solid components in the sample and inhomogenity ( perhaps next time the use of more sample is necessary. Also shering of samples with thin pipette could be tried)
gel run for ca 2 h at 0,02 A
Blotting of Gel for 1,5 h at 0,12 A
Gel was stained with Comassie oN
blot was blocked oN at 4°C( together with the dot blots) in 5% milk powder TBS-T
Dot Blot of expression of pIG15_105 and HA-GFP-His6-His6 from today (Sabi):
pipetting scheme : marked with a pen on the blot
1µl of the samples were pipetted onto the methanol-activated PVDF membrane
Membrane was still slightly wet or rewetted for the drops to be able to seep in
with SDS buffer prepared samples were spotted onto the membrane
additionally non treated samples were spotted onto the membrane
for Luciferase: samples that were diluted and mixed with reaction reagent from the plate reader were used
Membrane was blocked with TBS-T with 5% milk powder oN
