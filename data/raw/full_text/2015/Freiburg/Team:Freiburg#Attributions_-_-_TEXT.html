The iRIf device (built within the projects Proteintranslator FKZ 7533-7-11.6.3) and the knowledge of using it, as well as the techniques and devices for creating PDMS flow chambers (supported by the research from the EU project CE microarray funding number 606618) were kindly provided by AG Roth.
We thank Biametrics for the allowance to use their iRIf devices (built initially in the EU funded project SystemCerv grant number 306037) in Freiburg and for their personal training and discussion on site in Tübingen.
Chloroalkane compounds capable to bind a HaloTag onto surfaces were received by Prof. Wiesmüller, Tübingen, Germany.
From Prof. Piehler and his group, Osnabrück, Germany we obtained Ni-NTA coated iRIf slides for comparison to our Ni-NTA slides, as well as the polymer PLL-PEG-HTL that is capable to bind a HaloTag.
Based on protocols by Shinjiro Tachibana 1) and the National University of Singapore we developed Ni-NTA surfaces which were used for conducting our experiments.
Our cell-free expression system was established by ourselves based on protocols from Dr. Frank Bernhard, Frankfurt, Germany and the EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.
Prof. Dr. S. Dübel of the University of Braunschweig provided us with expression vectors for a Salmonella Typhimurium antigen ( pRIG15_15 ) and a corresponding single chain variable fragment ( pRIG15_13 ) .

The iGEM Team Freiburg acknowledges the generosity of the BIOSS - Centre for Biological Signalling Studies - for its financial support and for providing both a laboratory and great equipment. We would also like to thank our team leaders and advisors and the AG Roth from the ZBSA - Center for Biological Systems Analysis - who helped us realize our project by giving us advice, material and sharing their experiences.
BIOSS administration and Toolbox
Founded in 2008, BIOSS is an excellence cluster of the University of Freiburg focusing on signalling research and promoting a dialectic process between scientists using analytical and synthetic approaches. The interdisciplinary team of researchers is supported by the resource, storage, and information centre for biological materials, called Toolbox, which also provided us with professional advice, plasmids, cell lines, and antibodies. Therefore, we would like to thank the BIOSS, namely Dr. Nicole Gensch, for her great support for our project to all intents and Dr. Pavel Salavei for supporting us with tips and advices concerning protein expression and purification.
AG Ulbrich
We would like to express our deep appreciation for the constant support and critical input of Jun.-Prof. Dr. Maximilian Ulbrich.
AG Roth
We are particularly grateful to Dr. Günter Roth and his group for their patient guidance, enthusiastic encouragement, constructive critiques, and for the opportunity to use part of their resources.
A great thanks to Prof. Dr. Peters and the Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research and to Prof. Dr. Friedrich and the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy for the financial support of our team. Also, we would like to thank AG Albers, AG Baumeister, AG Boll, AG Dengjel, AG Eimer, AG Einsle, AG Friedrich, AG Hess, AG Hiltbrunner, AG Pyrowolakis, AG Reinheckel, AG Reski, AG Reth, AG Roth, AG Römer, AG Schamel, AG Schätz, AG Ulbrich, AG Weber, AG Wilde for providing us with material, sequencing credits, and helpful tips.
Our sincere thanks also extend to our immediate advisors Ilona Blank, Stefan Krämer, Philipp Schwenk, and Maike Smits. Without you we would not have been able to perform our project in that manner.
You were all invaluable to us!
