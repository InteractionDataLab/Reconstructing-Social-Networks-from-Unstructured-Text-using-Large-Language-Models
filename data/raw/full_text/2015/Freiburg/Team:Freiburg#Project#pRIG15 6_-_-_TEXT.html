pRIG15_6
The Rubella Virus causes the Rubella disease or the so-called German measles . It is a typical childrenâ€™s disease and can get dangerous when first infection occurs after childhood. In this biobrick we include the sequence for the Rubella Glycoprotein E1 which is an envelope associated protein 1) . To insert the sequence for rubella glycoprotein E1 into pSB1C3 we designed Gibson primers with compatible overhangs that also included the start codon ATG. The insert was amplified via PCR and then assembled with the digested pSB1C3 backbone using Gibson assembly.
Figure 1: pRIG15_6. BBa_K1621000 inserted into the submission backbone pSB1C3.
To prove correct insertion of our fragment we did a test digest (Link Labjournal) and sent the whole plasmid for sequencing (GATC). Link to GeneBank file: BBa_K1621000.gb . Link to Registry: BBa_K1621000
