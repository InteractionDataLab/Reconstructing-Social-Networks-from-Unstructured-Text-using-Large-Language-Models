Halosurface from ABCR
protocol for functionalizing glass slides with halotag ligand
material: (3-Chloropropyl)triethoxysilane, acetone, isopropanol, aqua dest.
duration: ca. 85 min
Wash with acetone, isopropanol, aqua dest.
Dry with nitrogengun
Activate in plasma generator : gas flow: 60-80 L/h, time: 10 min
Pipette 80 ÂµL of (3-Chloropropyl)triethoxysilane-solution per glass sandwich
Incubate for 1 h at RT
Part the sandwiches and put in acetonefor 30 s
Wash with acetone (work fast!!)
Dry with nitrogengun
