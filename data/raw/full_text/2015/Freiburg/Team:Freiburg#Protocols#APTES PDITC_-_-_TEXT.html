APTES + PDITC surface
Protocol for derivatisation of glass slide with APTES and coupling of amino groups
According to protocol from Christin (AG Roth)
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: … min
Slide preparation
Name the slide
Wash with: acetone, isopropanol, aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Activate in plasma generator : gas flow 80 L/h, time 2 min
APTES
Prepare APTES-solution:   for 5 slides:
18.8 mL acetone
1.0 mL dd aqua
0.2 mL APTES (always close with Parafilm)
Incubate slides for 30 min in slideholder filled with APTES-solution
Wash 2 x 5 min in slideholder with acetone
Dry with wafergun
Put slides in new slideholder and bake them in oven at 110 °C for 45 min
PDITC
Prepare PDITC-solution: for 5 slides:
pyridin 2.0 mL
DMF 18.0 mL
PDITC 40 mg
Cool down slides in slidebox with wafergun (go close with gun)
Incubate slides in slideholder for 2 h filled with PDITC-solution at RT
Discard PDITC-solution
Fill with ethanol and discard ethanol
Wash 2 x 5 min in slideholder with ethanol
Wash for 5min with acetone in slideholder
Discard acetone
Dry with wafergun
Dry for 15 min in desiccator (Exsiccator)
Spotting
Prepare 2 µM bBSA-solution (diluted from stock solution)
Put humid tissues inside petri-dish
for DNA spotting control use Spotting control Cy5 protocol
Spot 0.5 µL of DNA-control-solution (2 spots) and bBSA-solution (3 spots).
Use spotting templates!
Close petri-dish with Parafilm
Incubate overnight
Blocking
Prepare spots for blocking:
let spots become dry on air
wash immediately with aqua dest. and dry with wafergun
Prepare ethanolamine-solution (10 %, 20 mL):
2 mL ethanolamine
18 mL aqua dest.
Incubate slides for 30 min in slideholder filled with ethanolamine-solution
Fill with aqua dest. and discard aqua dest.
Wash 2 x 5 min with aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Pipette 80 µL of BSA-solution in PBS-buffer (10 mg/mL) per slide-sandwich
Incubate for 30 - 60 min
Wash with aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Binding of Strep-Cy5
Prepare Streptavidin-Cy5-solution (0.5 µg/mL)
180 µL BSA in PBS-buffer (10 mg/mL)
20 µL Strep-Cy5-stock solution (5 µg/mL)
Pipette 80 µL of Strep-Cy5-solution per slide-sandwich
Incubate for 45 min at RT (Put a tissue over petri dish)
Wash with aqua dest. by letting glide slidese into vase filled with aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Fluorescence detection
