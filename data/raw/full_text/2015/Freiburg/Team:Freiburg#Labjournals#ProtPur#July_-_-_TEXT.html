Protein Purification
30.07.2015
phyA purification
o/n culture 5ml was inoculated and set at 37°C (Amp+Gent)
purification of pET_1003; pET_1103; pET_1703 and pIG15_1301; pIG15_1501
additional to the purification protocol the flow-through of each sample was incubated o/n with Ni-NTA beads to test wether there is still target protein in the sample.
the next day beads were washed with 3 mL washing buffer and eluted in 2 fractions
fractions are labeled E6 and E7 on the gels
Results
Determination of protein concentrations by Amido-Black
from the slope and the intercept of the standard curve an amount of protein was computed for every sample measured. That amount was compared with the results from the nanodrop measurement.
Protein concentration from the amidoblack and the nanodrop measurements were compared. Values that are not covered by the amidoblack standard curve are marked in red

Purification of phyA
phyA1-406, #1652
N-terminal phA fragment in pGEX was transformed in the Arctic strain and plated out on Amp+Gentamycin, o/n 37°C
purification of pET_1003; pET_1103; pET_1703 and pIG15_1301; pIG15_1501
the pellets of 1 liter cultures were resuspended and sonificated according Cell disruption
the purification was performed according to the Protein Purification on gravity flow columns
with this purification we wanted to increase the protein concentration by the double amount of culture
for analysis, samples of all steps during the purification for the SDS-PAGE-Analysis; WesternBlot; and for the determination of the concntration by the Amido-Black protocol.
the elution were handed over to the iRIf and Surchem group
Results
To verify the antigen-antibody interaction we made a dot blot of each antigen with the specific antibody (LISTE ERSTELLEN) and the His-conjugated antibody from Qiagen.  Additional we performed western blots according to Western Blot towbin et al. . This western blot should confirm the interaction of the new polyclonal antibodies for HCV and HIV. For C.tetani we only have a monoclonal one. Also the gels were stained with coomassie after the blotting step onto the PVDF membrane. The blocking step was performed with 5% milk in TBS-T. The primary polyclonal antibodies were 1:500 diluted in TBS-T containing 5% BSA. The primary antibody was incubated o/n, 4°C.
Dot blot
dot blot of purified proteins with the specific antibody. e=elution
dot blot of purified proteins with the anti-his conjugated antibody
The dot blot for the specific antibodies looks very promising. But the western blots show a very unspecific binding of the polyclonal antibodies. Unfortunately the highest signal of the antibody-binding is not the target protein.

it is obvious, that also the his-conjugated antibody show unspecific binding. However in further experiments the presence of the target proteins was verified. Useful for comparison are the western blots of pET_1003 and pET_1703 on 16.07.2015; pET_1103 on 14.07.15; pET_1003 and pET_1703 on 10.07.2015 and pIG15_1501 and pIG15_1301 on 02.07.15.

1 liter of LB-medium was inoculated with the particular o/n culture, except for pIG15_1501. Here we only used 500ml LB-medium.
In this case we do not have to increase the culture due to the fact of high protein concentrations.
the cultures were set to 37°C, 180rpm
after an OD600 ~ 0.5 the cultures were induced with IPTG; the best IPTG concentration was tested in several overespression test and is recorded for each strain in the masterplan.
cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 g, 30 min, 4°C). The supernatant (LB-medium) was discarded and the pellet was washed in 10ml lysis buffer. To store the pellet, the 10ml (lysis buffer + resuspended cells) were centrifuged again (10 000rpm, 30min, 4°C) and frozen in the -20°C freezer.

centrifugation 10 000xg, 30min, 4°C
12,5% SDS-PAGE Analysis to verify, whether the protein is in the supernatant or in the pellet (inclusion bodies)
Results
sonification of 20ml samples pET_1003; pET_1103; pET_1703 by 12,5% SDS-PAGE Analysis
pET_1003: Hepatitis C Core Protein = 21 kDa
pET_1103: Clostridium tetani TeNT_Hc = 50 kDa
pET_1703: HIV tat/poI/gag/env = 20 kDa
for pET_1003 and pET_1103 no obvious enchrichment of the target protein. For pET_1703 the protein seems to be in the pellet. For further analysis a western blot with anti-His Tag antibody is going to be performed with all samples

SpyCatcher C43
Gels were destained o/n and photos taken
Results
15 % SDS-Gel from SpyCatcher Expression in C43 cells. No bands are visible at the appropriate height
Spy Catcher expression seems not to have been succesfull
Retry with a different expression strain or a fusion protein
fusion to mCherry would allow for direct coloclisation experiments with SpyTag-labeled GFP-protein
pET_803 overexpression in BL21
o/n stored pellets were resuspended in 5 mL Lysis Buffer each by 20 sec sonification
stored @ 4°C
samples from supernatant and pellet (9 µL +  6 µL 2.5x SDS-buffer) were boiled on 95°C for 5 min
store @ RT for gel loading
Results: Whole cell lysate
12.5 % SDS-Gel from cells before sonification. The Herpes simplex glycoprotein G1 may be the stornger band especially in the 37°C, 1mM 4h sample.
Whole cell lysates of E.coli BL21 (after overnight culture) and C43 strains transformed with pET_803. The expressed protein should have a molecular weight of 26.1 kDa corresponding to the protein enrichtment in 37°C lanes for all strains and induction conditions. In the before induction (b.i.) sample these bands are not visible thus may be a result of IPTG induction.
Results are promising that overexpresison was succesfull
Gels from sonification have to show if the protein in soluble
Results: Sonification
Sonification of cell samples after 2 hours of incubation (as shown above). Here the protein enrichment is visible in the supernatant, the antigen thus seems to be soluble.
Sonification of cell samples after 4 hours of incubation (as shown above).
Sonification of cell samples after overnight incubation (as shown above). The pale colouring of the gel may be due to inefficient staining.
Sonification shows the antigen as soluble and most expressed at 37°C 4 hours incubation in BL21
The overnight condition cannot be evaluated as staining was not very succesfull
If purification from the bigger batch does not work: keep in mind that overexpression conditions were not tested with OD_600 = 0.5 as starting conditition

37°C Pellet was not pipettable and used 1:2 diluted in 2.5x loading buffer
on first look there seem to be no bands with a molecular weight lower than 25 kDa
o/n culture of C43 SpyCatcher was canceled as there seems to be no expression
DotBlot: antibodies
antibody solution goat anti-GFP (the one the iRIf group got from Max) 1:1000 in PBS 5% milk was prepared
one membrane was incubated with this solution
the other membrane was incubated with rabiit anti-GFP 1:1000, 0.05 % Sodium azide (from the cellfree expresison group)
incubation for 2.5 h
incubation in TBS-T over day
anti-goat HRP couldn't be found → membrane was further incubated in TBS-T
mouse anti-GFP membrane was incubated 1 h in anti-mouse HRP (5 % milk powder in PBS)
detection in ECL reader
Results
Unmodified raw-image from 4 min luminscence detection.
Perspective transformed image with lookup-table coloring to simplfify comparison.
The mouse anti-GFP binding is strongest to the purified GFP from AG Ublrich even though all samples were normalized on fluorescence and should therefore contain comparable amounts of fluorophors
In the mCherry control no binding is visible → low amount of unspecific binding
The binding intensity for the two AG Weber samples is equal as expected from the same sample stored in different concentrations
pET_803: Overexpression test in BL21 and C43
for pre-culture of BL21 cells
3 200 mL and 3 500 mL flasks were filled with 100 mL or 200 mL LB-medium respectively
1:1000 Amp was added (100µL and 200 µL respectively)
cultures were started with 0.5 or 1 mL o/n culture respectively (only 5 mL culture in toto)
incubation @ 37°C
for pre-culture of C43-cells
2 50 mL flasks were filled with 25 mL LB-medium
1:1000 Amp was added (25 µL)
cultures were started with 25 µL o/n culture
incubation @ 37°C
cultures were around OD_600 0.2 after 1.5 h
cultures were grown to OD_600 of 2 after 2.5 h
diluted cultures with LB-Medium to an OD_600 of 0.5
added Amp (relative to the dilution volume)
incubation 0.5 h at 37°C 200 rpm
took aliquots (1 mL) from BL21 and C43 cells
induction with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 mM IPTG
OD_600 was again between 1 an 1.5 for the BL21 cultures and around 1.6 for C43
spin down aliquots 15000 g 2 min → resuspended in 200 µL 2.5x SDS-loading buffer
Cells are in exponential growth but may already be too dense for induction
after 2h 37°C 0.5 mM IPTG C43 culture was at OD_600 of 4.5 and BL21 28°C 1mM IPTG culture was at 3.84 → cells seem to grow
10 mL for sonification and 1 mL for the gel were taken 2h and 4h after induction

Western blot, pIG15_1301, pIG15_1501
The western blot should confirm, whether the purified proteins are enriched. For the specific detection anti-his-tag antibody is used. All purified proteins are his-tagged.  We used the monoclonal anti-his conjugated antibody from Qiagen. Purified GFP-His and crude lysate with overexpressed GFP-his were used for positiv control.
12% SDS-PAGE gel was used for the separation of the proteins according to their molecular weight
Semi-dry blotting was performed with PVDF membrane (1h, 0.1A)
afterwards the membrane was stained with ponceau solution to check, if the transfer was efficient.
the membrane was washed twice for 10min in TBS buffer at RT
Incubation for 1h in blocking solution at RT (special blocking solution of Qiagen; 1xblocking buffer, 0.5% blocking powder, 0.1% Tween)
afterwards membrane was washed for 10 min in TBS-Tween at RT and 10 min in TBS buffer
Following the incubation in Anti-His HRP Conjugate (1:1000 in blocking buffer)
membrane was washed twice for 10 min in TBS-T and 10 min in TBS buffer
Chemiluminescent detection was performed with peroxide solution and luminol enhancer solution
WB confirms the coomassie gels of the protein purification. Additionally pIG15_1301 shows a molecular weight of 35kDa.
This leads to the assumption, that gIII is cleaved off after the transfer into the periplasm.
