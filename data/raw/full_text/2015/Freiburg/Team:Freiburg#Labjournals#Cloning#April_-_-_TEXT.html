PCR product stored in the freezer
prepared 1% agarose gel (1x TAE buffer used for  running the gel)
110V, 55min
first reaction didn't work–> no lacI (lacI was the biggest fragment, so this is could be an explanation)
the next 4 reaction resultet in a fragment with the right size
last reaction seems to be to big, we expected ~700bp.
