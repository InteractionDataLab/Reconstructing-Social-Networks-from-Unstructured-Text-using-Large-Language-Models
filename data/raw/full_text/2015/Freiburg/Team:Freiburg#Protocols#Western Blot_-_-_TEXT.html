Western Blot Towbin et al.
protocol for Western Blot Towbin et al.
remarks concerning the protocol (author, adapted from etc.)
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: pipapo…
cut PVDF membrane and 4 whatman-papers in gel size
PVDF membranes have to be activated in 100% MeOH before use
Rinse membranes with blocking ubffer, Whatman-paper soaked in blocking buffer
stack 2 whatman, membrane, gel and 2 whatman into the blotting apparatus
(make sure there are no bubbles after adding each layer)
blot for 1h (thin gels) (0.8mA/cm^2 Gel)
block membrane ~ 30 min in blocking buffer
1st antibody incubation: 1h, RT or overnight 4°C
wash membrane 3x 10 min in 1x TBS-T
2nd antibody incubation: 1h, RT or overnight 4°C
wash membrane 3x 10min in 1y TBS-T
Staining with ECL:
put membrane into prepared foil
mix ECL-solution 1:1
put mix on membrane; assure good distribution of the mix over the whole membrane
incubation: 1min RT
perform the read-out
Solutions: 10x Transfer buffer:
30.275g Tris base
144g Glycine
bring up the volume to 1L with ddH2O
1xTransfer buffer:
700ml ddH2O
100ml 10x Transfer buffer
200ml Methanol
10x TBS
1M Tris/HCl pH 7.5
