Isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteriamodified after Roti-Prep Plasmid MINI
material: Kit , aqua dest.
duration: 45 min
resuspend bacteria in 250 µL resuspension buffer
add 250 µL lysis buffer and mix gently
incubate for 5 min at RT
add 350 µL neutralisation buffer, mix gently
centrifuge 10min, full speed, RT (big bench centrifuge)
transfer supernatant to column
centrifuge 30 sec, 10000g, RT (discard flow-through)
add 750 µL wash buffer
centrifuge 30 sec, 10000g, RT (discard flow-through)
centrifuge 60 sec, 10000g, RT
transfer column into 1.5 mL Eppendorff tube
add 50 µL aqua dest (vary volume according to concentration needs, for higher yield the water may be prewarmed)
incubate 5 min at RT
centrifuge 1 min 10000 g RT
⇒ DNA is in the Eppendorff tube
