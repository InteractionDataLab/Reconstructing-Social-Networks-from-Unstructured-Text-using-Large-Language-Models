Cell disruption
LP to disrupt E. coli cells by sonification and separate supernatant and pellet
material: PMSF, abs. ethanol, Lysis buffer
duration: ~ 2h with 10 samples
Prepare 200 µL 500 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (17.4 mg PMSF + 200 µL abs. ethanol)
resuspend frozen pellets in 10 mL Lysis buffer (as good as possible)
Disrupt cells by 5 min sonication on Bandelin sonoplus with 60 % sonification frequency and 50-70 % power
add 20 µL PMSF
centrifuge 30 min @ 10000 g 4°C
separate supernatant
centrifuge supernatánt 20 min @ 16000 g 4°C
buffers
standard buffer/lysis buffer
20 mM Tris pH 7.5
150 mM NaCl
0.3 mM PMSF
10mM Imidazole
