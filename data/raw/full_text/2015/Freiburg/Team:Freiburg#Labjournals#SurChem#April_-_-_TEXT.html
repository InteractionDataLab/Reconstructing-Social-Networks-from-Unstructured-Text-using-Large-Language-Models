Experiment 4: GFP concentration measurement
2015.04.15
from http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam :
Number of amino acids: 244 Molecular weight: 27709.1 Extinction coefficients:  Extinction coefficients are in units of  M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm measured in water. Ext. coefficient    22015 Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.795, assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines
Ext. coefficient    21890 Abs 0.1% (=1 g/l)   0.790, assuming all Cys residues are reduced
