Serum preparation
adapted from: protocol proimmune
material: blood sample, centrifuge, cryovials, liquid nitrogen, filter tips
~ 90 min
incubate blood sample in an upright position for 30 - 45 minutes at RT (maximum: 60 minutes)
centrifuge for 15 minutes at RT 1000 - 2000 rcf, do not use brake for stopping!
Inspect serum for turbidity. Turbid samples should be centrifuged and aspirated again to remove remaining insoluble matter.
aspirate supernatant (=serum) and aliquot into cryovials and  flashfreeze in liquid nitrogen and store at –80 °C, take care not to disturb the cell layer or transfer any cells
