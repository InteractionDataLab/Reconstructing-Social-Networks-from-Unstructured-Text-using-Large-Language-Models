Transformation
Introducing plasmid DNA into bacteria
material: chemical competent cells, heatblock (42°C), shaker (37°) LB plates (with antibiotics), LB-Medium (without entibiotics),  ice
duration: 2 h
Trafo
add 1 µL plasmid DNA to 25 µL chemical competent cells (thaw on ice and handle gently)
incubate 10 min on ice
heat shock 45 sec 42°C
incubate 2 min on ice
add 500 µL LB medium (without antibiotics)
incubate 1 h, 37°C (for re-trafo 15 min is sufficient)
centrifuge 4000 rpm, 1min (discard supernatant, resuspend in remaining medium)
plate 15 µL on LB-plates with antibiotics
incubate over night at 37°C
Gibson trafo
add 5 µL Gibson mix to 25 µL chemical competent cells (thaw on ice and handle gently)
heat shock 45 sec 42°C
incubate 2 min on ice
add 500 µL LB medium (without antibiotics)
incubate 1 h, 37°C
plate 300 µL on LB-plates with antibiotics
incubate over night at 37°C
