Accelerated Video showing two iRIf measurements with rabbit serum
Left video: First the binding partner (Streptavidin) for the positive control (biotinylated BSA) flushes over the slide, then serum (-) which is derived from the unimmunized rabbit. Right video: First the binding partner (Streptavidin) for the positive control (biotinylated BSA) flushes over the slide, then serum (+) which is derived from the rabbit, that was immunized to GFP. Only the immunized serum shows binding to the GFP spots indicating the presence of specific GFP antibodies.
