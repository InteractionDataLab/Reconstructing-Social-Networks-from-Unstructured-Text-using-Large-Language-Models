pRIG15_7
The Varicella Zoster Virus, also called Human Herpes Virus Type 3, causes chickenpox after first infection and remains as a latent infection. The sequence we used during our project codes for the extracellular part of the glycoprotein E 1) , which is the most abundant glycoprotein on the surface of infected cells. 2)
Figure 1: pRIG15_7. BBa_K1621001 inserted into the submission backbone pSB1C3.
To insert the sequence for Varicella Zoster glycoprotein E into pSB1C3 we designed Gibson primers with compatible overhangs that also included the start codon ATG. This fragment was amplified via PCR and then assembled with the digested pSB1C3 backbone using Gibson assembly. To prove correct insertion of our fragment we did a test digest and sent the whole plasmid for sequencing. Link to GeneBank file: BBa_K1621001.gb . Link to Registry: BBa_K1621001
