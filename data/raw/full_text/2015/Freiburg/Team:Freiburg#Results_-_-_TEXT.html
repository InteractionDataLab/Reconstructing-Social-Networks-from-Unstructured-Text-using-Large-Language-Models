Main Results
Our aim was to develop a novel diagnostic tool enabling fast, simultaneous and label-free detection of antibodies in human blood sera. We successfully generated our self-established cell-free expression system based on an E. coli lysate, which revealed an expression efficiency comparable to a commercial kit. To immobilize the expressed proteins, we established a surface that specifically binds our target proteins.  Combined in a microfluidic chamber we produced a protein array that can be flushed with a serum sample Label-free detection of antigen-antibody binding can be done in real-time by the interferometric method called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference).  Finally we built our own detection device in a simplified and cost-efficient manner and thus, making it available for future iGEM Teams.       Using the DiaCHIP, we did not only show the presence of antibodies in distinct solutions but also verified them in complex samples as human blood serum.
Detection of Anti-Tetanus Antibodies in Human Blood Serum
Figure 1: Quotient picture of GFP and tetanus antigen spots. Human blood serum of an immunized person against tetanus followed by an anti-human antibody was flushed over the chip. A & B: Tetanus spotsshow binding of anti-tetanus and anti-human antibody, respectively; C & D: GFP spots used as negative control.
To test the DiaCHIP under real-life conditions, we analysed the blood serum of a person that has been immunized against tetanus for the presence of anti-tetanus antibodies. First we confirmed the binding of antibodies present in the blood to our purified tetanus antigen by ELISA. Then we spotted the antigen and GFP, which both were expressed in E.coli and purified by His-tag affinity purification, on a PDITC surface. The much stronger binding of blood components to the tetanus antigen spots compared to GFP spots indicates specific interactions. By confirming that the bound blood components are human antibodies with anti-human, we successfully demonstrated that we are able to detect antibody binding even in complex samples. ▼ Detailed Description.
Figure 2: Western Blot of His-tagged C. tetani antigen with anti His-tag HRP Conjugate. The soluble fraction of the overexpressed protein was used for this Western Blot. The expected molecular weight is 50 kDa. Anti- His Tag HRP conjugated antibody was used in a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer.
The antigen used for detection of anti-tetanus antibodies is derived from the tetanus neurotoxin and commonly used for in vitro testing. For preparation of the DiaCHIP, this antigen had to be overexpressed in E. coli and purified from whole cell lysate. To verify the successful purification of the antigen, Western Blot analysis was performed (figure 2). The usage of an antibody against the N-terminal His-tag revealed a protein with a molecular weight of about 50 kDa. This correlates with the expected molecular weight of the antigen 1) .
Figure 3: ELISA for the tetanus antigen with blood samples taken after the immunization. The graph shows the absorption over time for TMB. The red line shows the binding of anti-tetanus antibodies out of the blood serum to purified tetanus antigen and the blue line shows the binding of HRP-Streptavidin to bBSA. The grey lines show the corresponding negative controls.
We performed an ELISA to investigate, whether the blood samples we obtained contain antibodies that bind specific to our purified tetanus antigen. Therefore, we spotted tetanus antigen and bBSA of the same concentration (12.5 µg/mL) and 2 times PBS as negative controls. The tetanus antigen and one PBS well were incubated with 5 mg/mL BSA, blood serum, and HRP-labeled anti-human for 1 h, respectively. The bBSA and the other PBS well were incubated with HRP-labeled Streptavidin (0.5 µg/mL) for 1  h (positive control). After each step the wells were washed with PBS. To visualize the binding, Tetramethylbenzidine was added and the absorption at 650 nm was measured in a plate reader over time (figure 3). The absorption signal for tetanus is even higher than the positive control, which illustrates the successful binding of antibodies from the blood to tetanus antigen.
Figure 4:  Binding curves for the detection of the binding of anti-tetanus antibodies from blood serum via iRIf shown in figure 1.
After the validation of the antigen antibody binding for tetanus by ELISA we wanted to see if we can detect this interaction also with iRIf. Therefore we first expressed our Clostridium tetani antigen and GFP in E.coli. The purified His-tagged proteins then were spotted on a PDITC surface. The slide with the immobilized proteins was flushed with human blood serum, and anti-human antibody. Strong binding was detected for the tetanus antigen spots, while the GFP spots only exhibited minimal binding (see figure 1A-D). This indicates that components contained in the blood serum bind specifically to the tetanus antigen. The subsequent binding of anti-human antibody to the tetanus antigen spots (figure 4) confirms the presents and binding of human antibodies to the spotted tetanus antigens. These results successfully demonstrate that it is possible to detect the binding of antibodies from blood serum to antigens immobilized, on a surface.
Figure 5: Quotient picture of iRIf measurement. Line A was flushed with serum taken before vaccination against tetanus. Line B was flushed with serum taken 2 weeks after vaccination. Spots from left to right show: GFP, neg. control, Tetanus antigen.
With an additional experiment we wanted to see if we can differentiate the vaccination status of patients with our system. Therefore we used blood serum samples, taken before and two weeks after immunization against tetanus. A slide with immobilized tetanus antigen and GFP was prepared (figure 5). It was consecutively flushed with both blood sera.  The blood serum taken after vaccination exhibits a much more intense binding to the tetanus spot than the serum taken before binding. Unfortunately we did not had enough anti-human antibody to proof further the presents of bound human antibodies from blood serum.
Figure 6: Quotient pictures of slides flushed with blood serum taken before and after vaccination. (A) Schematic pattern of proteins immobilized on a glass slide. (B) Quotient picture of iRIf measurement flushed with anti-GFP and blood serum taken before vaccination . (C) Quotient picture of iRIf measurement in which the slide was flushed with anti-GFP and blood serum five weeks after vaccination.
While the outcome of this first experiment looked promising for our future application to determine the vaccination status of patients, further experimentation did not confirm these initial results. We were still able to detect binding of both blood sera to the tetanus antigen, but no difference in binding intensity was visible. To test the assumption that the used blood was not fresh enough and therefore lost some of its binding capabilities a fresh blood sample five weeks after vaccination was taken for the experiment (See figure 6B and C).    To determine whether the identification of the vaccination status is possible with our system further experimentation needs to be done.
Besides tetanus, other antigens of immunological relevance were taken into account. See all the results we obtained in terms of diagnostics .

Detection of Anti-GFP Antibodies using Cell-Free Expressed GFP on   Ni-NTA
Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.
Video 2: Binding of anti-GFP   antibodies to His-GFP on a Ni-NTA surface. Anti-GFP antibody binds   to purified His-GFP and cell-free expressed HIs-GFP. Control spots   consisting of cell-free expression mix without DNA template show no binding.
Our self-made cell-free expression mix, the DiaMIX, in combination   with specific glass surfaces allows the expression and immobilization of   target proteins in a distinct manner. The DiaMIX, after expressing His-  tagged GFP, was spotted onto a Ni-NTA coated glass slide side-by-side with   conventionally purified His-GFP. Even after several washing steps it could   be shown that the proteins maintain stable on the surface. This is shown via   an iRIf measurement: Antibodies against GFP are flushed over the slide to   detect GFP that is bound to the slide. The specific binding of anti-GFP   antibodies to the control spot (purified GFP) and the cellfree expressed GFP   confirms the success of cellfree GFP expression and its immobilization on   the surface.
▼ Detailed   Description.
We could successfully show that the cell-free expression of His-GFP   results in functional GFP proteins that are bound by anti-GFP antibody   during an iRIf measurement.       The DNA coding for GFP fused to a 10x His-tag was added to the DiaMIX and expression was performed for 2 h. The DiaMIX   containing cell-free expressed His-GFP was then spotted on an iRIf slide   with a Ni-NTA surface by hand (figure 1).       The spots were incubated on the slide overnight.
Figure 1: Specific Ni-NTA surface on iRIf glass   slide.
This specific surface allows binding of the expressed His-GFP via the His-tag while all the other proteins present in the DiaMIX are not bound to the surface. This step was followed by the blocking and washing protocol to prevent further unspecific binding.       The iRIf slide was then flushed with an anti-GFP antibody solution, to analyze the binding to the cell-free expressed His-GFP. As a positive control we spotted a purified His-GFP onto the surface as well as DiaMIX that did not contain any DNA as negative control figure 2).

The measurement shows a high signal for the cell-free expressed His-GFP and the positive control as can also be seen in the respective binding curve shown in figure 3.

The spot on the left shows   the positive control, His-GFP expressed in E. coli, purified and   spotted onto the Ni-NTA surface. The negative control represents the DiaMIX   without DNA. A clear iRIf signal is detected for the positive control and   the cellfree expressed GFP.

Building Our Low-Cost DiaCHIP Measuring Device
Figure 1: Functional and low-cost variant of the   measuring device.
Commercial systems using the iRIf technology (imaging Reflectomretric   Interference) are mostly bulky and expensive machines even though the   components they are based on are rather simple. So we decided on building   our own device consisting of not much more than two lenses, an LED and a   camera. With this system we were able to reliably detect the binding of   anti-GFP to GFP, thus confirming a detection sensitivity in the range of   protein-protein interactions. To enable future iGEM Teams to profit from   this device as we did, we provide all plans and parts necessary to rebuild   it on this website for everyone to download and use. ▼ Detailed   Description.

Video 1: Demonstration of the   capability of our iRIf device at measuring antibody-antigen   interaction. GFP was spotted on the left side, rabbit proteins   (anti-HCV antibodies from rabbit) on the right side.
To test our device we aimed at reproducing measurements that we were   previously able to perform in our commercial device. For this reason we   focused on using two antibodies: anti-GFP and polyclonal anti-rabbit. GFP   and rabbit derived anti-HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) antibody were used as   antigens in this experiment. Note that the anti-HCV antibody only served as   binding partners for the anti-rabbit antibodies, since no HCV proteins were   used in this experiment.       The antigens were spotted onto an iRIf slide with an APTES/PDITC   surface. The spots on the slide were produced by pipetting 3.5 µl [1 mg/ml]   rabbit-anti-HCV protein and 3.5 µl [1 mg/ml] GFP onto the slide and   incubated overnight. After incubation the slide was blocked for 30 min in   BSA solution.        A Canon 50D camera was used to record the measurement and was set to   take one picture every 5 seconds. The exposure time was set in order for the   pixels in the image to be approx. 80% of maximum light saturation before the   solution was flushed onto the chip.        The antibody solutions were pipetted into the flow-chamber without the   use of any microfluidic device. Instead, a syringe was loaded with 660 µl [5   µg/ml] anti-GFP antibody solution (diluted in PBS) and connected to the   input pipe of our device. The content of the syringe was then slowly   released via this pipe into the chamber of the device by gently dispensing   the solution from the syringe. When the whole volume was run over the chip,   the process was repeated with 660 µl [5 µg/ml] anti-rabbit antibody solution   in the same way. The injection of both solutions was performed during   approximately 45 minutes.
Figure 3: Quotient picture of the same measurement   with favorable light conditions.
The quotient pictures show all intensity shifts that occurred during the   measurement. Two left spots: GFP spots at which an intensity shift occurred   during anti-GFP flush. Right spot: anti-HCV antibody (derived from rabbit),   at which an intensity shift occurred during the flush with anti-Rabbit.
Figure 4: Comparison of two quotient pictures of   our DiaCHIP with the professional setup. Left: Professional device;   Right: Our device.  Both quotient pictures show the binding events that occurred during an iRIf   measurement with anti-GFP at the GFP spots.
Video 1 shows the results of the measurement. Both, binding of anti-  GFP and anti-rabbit to the corresponding antigen spots, could be observed.   Due to the fact that the experiment was performed on our DiaCHIP device   which was built with a transparent casing, fluctuations in surrounding light   had a strong, detrimental influence on the measurement quality. To minimize   the influence of the unstable surrounding light, the resulting pictures had   to be averaged over 10 pictures each. This in turn led to a more stable   light situation, however the signal strength dropped as a consequence.   Figure 3 shows a quotient picture of the measurement where the light   situation was temporarily appropriate. The problem of surrounding light   scattering into the device can of course be overcome using a non-transparent   casing. An evaluation of how well our device performs in comparison with the   professional device was not performed, mainly due to time constraints.   However our results hint that we get comparable results for strong binding   such as GFP/anti-GFP, as can be seen in figure 4.

Establishing a Highly Specific Ni-NTA Surface
Figure 1: Cell-free expressed GFP-His spotted   on a Ni-NTA slide. Cell-free expression was performed for 2 hours   at 37°C. The positive control was purified GFP-His, the negative control was   a sample of cell-free expression mix not containing DNA.
Since there are a variety of proteins present in the cell-free mix a   specific surface on the future protein array is essential. That is why we   established our Ni-NTA surface for the immobilization of the antigens on the   chip. All expression constructs contain a His-tag fused to the coding   sequence, resulting in antigens that can bind specifically to our Ni-NTA   surface. Compared to an unspecific surface (PDITC) we could show that this   Ni-NTA surface allows efficient binding of the target protein and prevents   unspecific binding of other proteins that are present in the cell-free mix   (figure 1). ▼ Detailed   description.
Figure 2: Cell-free expressed His-GFP spotted on   a PDITC slide. Cell-free expression was performed for 2 hours at   37°C. The positive control was purified His-GFP, the negative control was a   sample of cell-free expression mix not containing DNA.
For cell-free protein expression lots of different proteins, like   RNA-polymerases, ribosomes and other E. coli proteins are essential.   During the process of cell-free expression all these proteins are, besides   the target protein, also present in the microfluidic chamber. To have a   sufficient amount of target protein immobilized on the chip we established a   specific surface chemistry on the glass slide. After testing several tag systems we   established a Ni-NTA surface. Using a Ni-NTA covered glass slide (figure 1)   we could increase the amount of bound cell-free expressed His-GFP compared   to an unspecific surface (figure 2). In both experiments 1.5 µg of self   purified GFP-His was used as positive control. The cell-free expression mix   without DNA is supposed to result in no target protein and served as   negative control. The cell-free reactions were performed for 2 hours at 37°C   in a seperate tube prior to pipetting the samples by hand onto the surfaces   and incubated on the slide overnight. Before measurment in the iRIf device,   the optical detection method we use, the slides were blocked with BSA and   then flushed with anti-GFP antibodies. An increase in light intensity where   the spotted protein was located represents a binding event. Due to less   unspecific binding of proteins to the surface, the interaction of anti-GFP   antibodies with cell-free expressed His-GFP is higher on the Ni-NTA surface.

Producing Our Cell-free Expression Mix
Figure 1: Cell-free expression of our DiaMIX in   comparison to a commercial kit over time. Measurements were   performed every minute for 120 minutes (Excitation: 480 nm; Emission:   520nm). Reactions were performed in triplicates and normalized to air.   Negative controls were subtracted as background. Corridors represent the   standard deviation. A propagation of error and smoothening of the values was   conducted.
A key feature of our DiaCHIP is the on-demand antigen production via   cell-free expression. Thereby, a fixed DNA template is copied into our   desired antigen, which in turn can bind to our specific surface. Our   expression mix called DiaMIX was established from scratch. It is based on an E. coli lysate. In a direct comparison with a commercial product our   mix showed comparable expression rates, indicating its performance   capability (figure 1). ▼ Detailed   Description.
Our DiaMIX is a complex system consisting of several individually   adjusted components that allow us to make use of the cells own production   system, without the tedious drawbacks of normal cell-based protein   expression. As a main component of the DiaMIX the E. coli lysate contains the   necessary transcription and translation apperatus. The lysate is   complemented by additives needed for energy regeneration, buffering, and   generation of the protein. An overview of cell-free expression systems and   its components can be found on our project   pages .
As ultimate evaluation, we compared the DiaMIX to a commercial kit   as seen in figure 1.
Both expression systems successfully expressed the applied   vector.
Furthermore, the cell-free expression of GFP with our cell-free mix   could be verified in an iRIf measurement .
To obtain these final results, a lot of optimization and testing had   to be done. Want to know more about how we established the DiaMIX? You can   find detailed information about the most important experiments on the cell-free   expression results page .

Explore the DiaCHIP
For establishing our device, we optimized all steps from the   immobilization of DNA on the silicone of the flow-chamber to the specific   binding of the target proteins on the glass slide. This way, we generated   protein arrays we can use to detect different antibodies in human and rabbit   serum with the iRIf detection method.
