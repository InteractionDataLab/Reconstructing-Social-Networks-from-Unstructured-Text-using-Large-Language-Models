PDMS-Moulding_Flowcells
Protocol for PDMS-Moulding of Flowcells
According to protocol from Philipp (AG Roth)
material: PDMS (Elastosil RT 607 A/B),Ethanol, SpeedMixer, Zentriform, Zentrifuge, Scale, Mixing cup, torque spanner
duration: 30min preparation,  1,5h zentrifugation, 15 min cutting, cleaning
Work with powder free (white) gloves only!
Put the clean wafer in the clean zentriform (optional cleaning with KIM-wipes, be careful not to touch the inside of zentriform to often)
Put in the sealing rim (“Devil’s Ears should still be excisable)close zentriform, tighten screws with torque spanner (1,9N)
PDMS-component A: shake bottle thoroughly (liquids might separate over time)
Put mixing cup on the scale and push „tare“
49,5 g PDMS component  A
5,5 g component B
Close mixing cup at once and quickly place in the SpeedMixer
Program 1, 500rpm, 15 sec (slight mixing)
Program 2, 1500 rpm, 1min
Place the first zentriform on the scale, fill in 20-22 g of mixed PDMS and push „Tare“
Place second zentriform on the scale and fill in mixed PDMS until scale shows “0”
Place both zentriforms in the zentrifuge
Program 3: 5 min, 1000 rpm, 24°C
Program 2: 500 rpm, 99 min, 70 °C
Take out zentriforms as long as they are still warm, then it is easier to clean them ( but leaving them alone longer won’t do any harm)
Measure the thickness of the flowcell (0,95-1,1mm)
Cut out flowcells using a template, don’t forget the holes (drilling, not pushing!)
Be careful not to touch the inner compartment of the flow cell!!!
