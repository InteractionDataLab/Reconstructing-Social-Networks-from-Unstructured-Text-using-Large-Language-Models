Experiment 22: Comparison between different GFPs (Own,Max,Weber), replicate 1
protocols used : Plasma activation , GOPTS surface , APTES + PDITC surface
2015.06.30
GOPTS solution was contaminated!
→ prepared GOPTS aliquot (1mL) from fresh GOPTS stock
fall out in APTES solution → also contaminated ?!
Considerations
prepare slides comparable to slides made in AG Roth
compare different GFP solutions: GFP used before, new GFP from AG Weber practical, new GFP without tag in cell lysate expressed by ourselves and new GFP with His-Tag expressed by us
First spotting test with HA-mCHerry-His expressed by us
use AG-Roth internal DNA binding and spotting control standards
Experiment
made 4 GOPTS and 4 PDITC slides according to GOPTS surface and APTES + PDITC surface protocol
measured fluorescence of different GFP-solutions in plate reader
GFP fluorescence was determined by excitation at 485 nm and measurement at 528 nm
mCherry fluoroescence: 575 nm → 620 nm

slides were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C
results
it was impossible to evaluate the fluorescence measurement, because most of the spots weren't even visible, so probably the surface wasn't good enough or the GFP was already denaturated
Experiment 19: Ni-NTA storage experiment
protocols used : Plasma activation , GOPTS surface , APTES + PDITC surface , Ni-NTA
2015.06.15
Experiment/Protocol
Made 4 standard  APTES/PDITC slides  and 2 slides using iRIf-slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Made 4 GOPTS slides on standard glass using standard GOPTS-Protocol
All 8 slides were sandwiched with AB-NTA solution (0.042g AB-NTA, 0.029g NaHCO3, 350 µl aqua dest.) by adding 80 µl
2015.06.16
considerations
continue Ni-NTA slides from previous day
Experiment/Protocol
finished Ni-NTA slides according to Ni-NTA protocol
every washing/blocking solution was prepared with HBS instead of PBS
Nickelsulfate was deluted in water to prevent falling out
Ni-NTA-slides were stored at 4 °C for 2 weeks
Results
Results mentioned in Experiment 28
Experiment 18: Measure dark current
protocols used :-
2015.06.13
considerations
measure dark current to determine its influence on fluorescence measurements
Experiment / Protocol
measured dark current by taking unlit photos in the fluorescence microscope at differing shutterspeed
Results
Measured intensity of the dark current for varying shutterspeeds
Influence of the dark current on the fluorescence intensity measurements is negligible due to its small magnitude
Experiment 17: Second fluorescence intensity/shutterspeed linearity test
protocols used :-
2015.06.13
considerations
test spot intensity/shutterspeed linearity
Experiment / Protocol
diluted GFP stock solution 1:10 and 1:100
spotted 1 µl GFP stock solution and dilutions on glass slide
measured fluorescence intensity of the three spots with  fluorescence microscope at different shutterspeeds
Results
Measured fluorescence intensities of different concentrated GFP spots for varying shutterspeeds
linearity of fluorescence intensity and shutterspeed up to an intensity of ca. 2500 confirmed
Experiment 16: Remeasuring of the GFP stock concentration
protocols used :-
2015.06.13
considerations
remeasure GFP stock concentration by using the nanodrop
Experiment / Protocol
measured GFP stock concentration by using the nanodrop
Results
GFP stock concentration
mean GFP stock concentration was measured: 1105.5 mg/ml → differs from previous measurements
Experiment 15: Ni-NTA surfaces/Test imidizole washing
protocols used : Plasma activation , GOPTS-Protocol , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking , Ni-NTA
2015.06.13
Considerations
prepare 2 iRIf slides with PDITC-surface for the iRIf group to stamp on
start again with Ni-NTA surface on GOPTS and PDITC surfaces
Experiment / Protocol
Protocols used: Plasma activation , GOPTS-Protocol , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking , Ni-NTA
Made 6 standard  APTES/PDITC slides  and 2 slides using iRIf-slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Made 4 GOPTS slides on standard glass using standard GOPTS-Protocol
iRIf-slides were stored @ 4°C for further use by the iRIf group
the remaining 10 slides (6x APTES/PDITC and 4x GOPTS) were treated with Ni-NTA according to Ni-NTA protocol
2015.06.14
Considerations
continue Ni-NTA slides from previous day
Experiment / Protocol
finished Ni-NTA slides according to Ni-NTA protocol
Nickel loading step was first performed in PBS → fall out of salt
changed to water blocked again for 1 h
spotted GFP in concentrations of 1600 mg/mL, 1000 mg/mL & 500 mg/mL according to Spotting+Blocking protocol
GFP was diluted in 1/10 PBS to preserve Ni-NTA-Chelate
spotted slides were stored o/n @ 4°C
Results
Nickel-solutions should not be prepared in PBS
Low solubility constant of 4.74 x 10-32 for Ni3(PO4)2 1)
Change to HBS instead of PBS in the whole protocol may solve this issue
Mean Fluorescence Intensity of 3 concentrations of GFP on Ni-NTA/GOPTS and Ni-NTA/APTES slides
Only in the slide not washed with imidazol (APTES1) there is an increase in intensity with increasing GFP-concentration
In slide APTES4 the retained fluorescence is much higher than in the other slides → one slide wih good surface?
Replication of this experiment may lead to advanced slide handling and thus to results with higher consistency
The GOPTS-slides (with or without imidazol wash) retained much less fluorescence than the PDITC-derived slides
2015.06.15
Considerations
continue with Ni-NTA slides from previous days
washing steps of GFP loaded slides should be performed with 20 mM Imidazol in PBS or PBS only for 2 GOPTS and 3 PDITC slides respectively
Experiment/Protocol
His-GFP solution spots were removed with pipette (3 µl) from GOPTS slides. APTES slides were completely dry so blocking solution was immediately added.
all slides were incubated for 10-15 min with 10 mg/ml BSA solution (3 µl spots) in the wells
slides „were glided“ into HBS solution pH 7.5 and wells were slowly flooded with HBS before the spotting mask was removed
Washing 2×10 min HBS pH 7.5 (no shaking)
Washing 10 min in 1/10 diluted HBS (1 APTES, 2 GOPTS) OR 10 min in 1/10 HBS with 20 mM Imidazol (5 APTES, 2 GOPTS)
Dried with wafergun and fluorescence was measured
bBSA ans BSA spots were covered with 5 µl of Strep-Cy5 solution (2 µg/ml)+BSA (10 mg/ml)
Washing 2×10 min in HBS pH 7.5 (no shaking)
Washing 10 min in 1/10 diluted HBS (diluted in aqua dest.)
Slides were dried with wafer gun and Cy5 fluorescence was measured in microarray scanner
Results
in general there was less unspecific binding on the APTES/PDITC slides, than on the GOPTS slides
for the GOPTS slides the use of imidazole during the washing step reduced the unspecific binding
for APTES/PDITC suprisingly the slide that was washed without imidazole had the fewest unspecific binding (StrepCy5)
Experiment 14: Reproducibility test of GOPTS and PDITC slides (replicate experiment 11+12)
protocols used : Plasma activation , GOPTS-Protocol , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking \\-NTA]]
2015.06.12
considerations
repeat GFP-spotting experiment the third time
create measurable iRIf slides with GFP
Experiment / Protocol
Protocols used: Plasma activation , GOPTS-Protocol , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking
Made 2 standard  APTES/PDITC slides  and 2 slides using iRIf-slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Made 4 GOPTS slides on standard glass using standard GOPTS-Protocol
one GOPTS slide has one spot with reduced volume (2 µL) and one spot less at 1000 µg/mL and 500 µg / mL respectively
one APTES iRiF slide has different spotting scheme
used 50 µg/ml bBSA for control spot
Results
Mean Fluorescence Intensity of 3 concentrations of GFP on GOPTS and APTES slides.
Experiment 13: Optimitation of washing steps and preparational process for basic slides (replicate experiment 11)
protocols used : Plasma activation , GOPTS-Protocol , APTES + PDITC surface , Spotting+Blocking
2015.06.02
considerations
Try new spotting and blocking protocol.
Changes from protocol (28.5.2015):
Changed washing with H2O in step 3 and 5 to PBS
Measure fluorescence of GFP before Strep-Cy5 inkubation
Experiment/Protocol
Made 4  APTES/PDITC slides using standard APTES + PDITC surface
Made 4 GOPTS slides using standard GOPTS-Protocol
three APTES/PDITC and three GOPTS slides  were spotted like described in Spotting+Blocking one of each was an iRiF slide
one APTES/PDITC and one GOPTS slide were spotted using PDMS spotting masks
Results
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces measured under „dry“ and „wet“ conditions (with and without PBS)
Tendencies from 28.5.2015 experiment confirmed
Fluorescence under „wet“ conditions (with PBS) much higher
Mean GFP fluorescence intensity of different concentrated spots on PDITC surfaces with shutterspeed of 1s and normalised shutterspeed of 4s and 8s
Intensity values should not differ but they do→ further investigate
Influence of PDMS spotting help on mean GFP fluorescence spot intensity on GOPTS and APTES/PDITC surfaces
PDMS spotting help useful on PDITC →confirm results from 28.5.2015
