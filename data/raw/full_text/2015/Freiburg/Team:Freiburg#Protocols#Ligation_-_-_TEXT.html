Ligation
Classical cloning as well as Gibson Assembly require the action of ligases to covalently assemble DNA fragments. Before ligation, those fragments anneal to each other due to complementary overhangs.
Amount
Ingredient

Backbone
3 fold molar amount
Insert
2 µl
10X T4-Ligase Buffer
1 µl
T4-Ligase
ad 20 µl

Incubate for 30 min at RT
Calculating the amount of insert
Ligation Excel Sheet
required Volume of Insert = 3 x Volume(Bb) x length(In) x concentration(Bb) / [ length(Bb) x concentration(In) ]
In short: V(In) = 3 x V(Bb) x l(In) x c(Bb) / [ l(Bb) x c(In) ]
