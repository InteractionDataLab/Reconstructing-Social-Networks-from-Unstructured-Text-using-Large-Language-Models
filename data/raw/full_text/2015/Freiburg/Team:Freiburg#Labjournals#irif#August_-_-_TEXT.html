Plateready after iRIf showed cy5 signal at some spots on every slide. This means (probably) that the biotinylated a-GFP bound to GFP. Looking at the cy5 spots, analogous areas in RIfs were taken for spot evaluation. Spot evaluation showed anti-GFP binding (but less signal) to GFP in every case.   → On slide expression of GFP at least seemed to work to a little amount

His-GFP lysate quite weak intensity –> maybe too much diluted Kokos cell free expressed GFP works fine on Ni-NTA; does not work on PDITC –> thats good → specific surface

The relative intensity shift for the three approaches (Serum(-)Serum(+) on Ni-NTA ; Serum(-)Serum(+) on PDITC; Serum(-)a-GFP on Ni-NTA) were compared. As expected and seen in the binding curves cellfree expression Mix (His-GFP) shows no signal on PDITC (other proteins within the mix bind to the surface) but on specific Ni-NTA surface. Taken amount of serum performs less (2-3 fold) than 3 ug/ml a-GFP.
Evaluation of the relative intensity shift. From left to right spot 1-11. For each spot rel. intensity shift is plotted with bars for Serum(-)flush and Serum(+)/a-GFP

Slide 24: Selection of ROIs: 1 HIV spot (spot 2) and one HCV spot (spot 3) were excluded due to high amounts of salt on it
Slide 24: Binding curves
Slide 502: Selection of ROIs
Slide 502: Binding curves for all spots
Slide 502: Binding curve (second Salmonella spot excluded)
Results: We have specific antibody/antigen binding for Salmonella! (a-HIV/HCV do not bind…)  Slide 502: During measurement within the first buffer step/blocking step most of the second Salmonella spot was washed away. Related to this the spot behaves strange. Slide 24: Also anti-salmonella lysate was tested. Here we see (as expected) stronger unspecific binding at other spots (nevertheless greatest binding for the salmonella spots). The unspecific/transient binding proteins get mostly washed away during the following buffer step.

Again no antibody-binding was detected → We confirmed that in this manner the experiment does not work Binding curves were evaluated, but revealed no further information. Due to the large protocol and some (air)problems (see binding curves of slide 465) during measurement in both cases, curves do not look neat.
Slide 265: Binding curves; some spots were expluded from the evaluation due to air that came on top of them during measurement
Slide 465: Binding curves; this is what it looks like if you do not exclude the spots were air arrived during measurement (spot 2&8) from the evaluation

Results: Anti-His at least confirmed that something with a His-Tag is within the HIV and HCV spots (see binding curves of slide 12).
Slide 208: Binding curves; flushing with anti-Salmonella lysate screwed up the measurement → protocol only to this step
Slide 208: Selection of ROIs: As can be seen we faced some problems during that measurement ;)

Results: Binding of anti-phyA to phyA was not observed in RIfs. Yet, at both measurements was faced some problems: much of the protein was washed away from the spotted spot. → We have to take lower concentrations for spotting (100-400 ug/ml) Anti-tYFP to YFP binding could not be detected aswell: Actually, this wont work on PDITC since all of the expression mix proteins also bind to the spot, compete with the (already low concentration) YFP for binding → almost no YFP can bind to the spot.  We have to repeat experiment for cellfree expressed YFP/GFP with specific surface (e.g. Ni-NTA)

Slide 303: Inverted QP during initial buffer step: Shows that already much of the PhyA is flushed away from the spot
