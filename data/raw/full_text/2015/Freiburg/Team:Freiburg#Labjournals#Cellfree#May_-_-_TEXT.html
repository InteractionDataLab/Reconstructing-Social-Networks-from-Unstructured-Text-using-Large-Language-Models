- 24µl plasmid DNA added to 100 µl aliquot of TOP10 cells
- incubation, 10 min, on ice
- 45 sec heat-shock at 42°C
- incubation, 2 min, on ice
- addition of 900µl Lb
- incubation, 1.5h, 37°C, 700rpm
- plating pellet on Cmp-Agar
- incubation, over night, 37°C

A high insert-to-backbone ratio was used to get higher ligation probability.
The ligation is performed at 4°C over night.

simultaneous dephosphorylation during incubation (1hr, 37°C, 0rpm)
gel electrophoresis of digestion in 1% agarose showed two clear bands in each construct:
The DNA-ladder in both runs is not visible because it has not been stained with Midori Green Direct, like the samples were.
The visible bands were then cut out and stored at - 20°C.

20. - 27.05.2015
successful amplification of IRES sequence from Stanford for eukaryotic expression system
blunt end ligation in pJET
plate almost overgrown
lots of unsuccessful cloning of pSB1C3 with G block containing new initiation cassete, no lacI and t7 promotor
lots of empty plates
probably due to unsuccesful ligation and therefore no chloramphenicol reistance in cells
Wed, 13.05.2015
package from AG Bernhard from Frankfurt arrived, containing 17x 350µl of CFES with T7RNAP.
stored in -80°C freezer: upper compartment, pink plastic box
Fri, 08.05.2015
gel extraction of PCR product from 07.05. using the QIAquick Kit by Qiagen
changes to  QIAquick protocol: Elution with 30µl H2O instead of elution buffer
verification in NanoDrop showed no product (=3ng/µl)
was Koko's first GelEx; unknown error

Construction of prokaryotic cell free expression vector:
PCR with primer oIG15_016f and oIG15_008r from Pet22b+
Gel (1%) of PCR with primers oIG15_016f and oIG15_008r from pet22b+
95 V 1 h 10 min
fragments have the right size –> gel extraction with Quiagen kit (elution with 30 µl Wasser at 30°C)
concentration changes depending on mood of Nanodrop (around 80 ng/µl)
Cloning of pIG15_003:
Gibson:
pSB1C3 backbone (chloramphenicol resistant)
+ fragment oIG15_016r and oIG15_008r of Pet22b+
+ fragment oIG15_001f and oIG15_002 of Pet22b+ (lac1: 32,7 ng/µl)
