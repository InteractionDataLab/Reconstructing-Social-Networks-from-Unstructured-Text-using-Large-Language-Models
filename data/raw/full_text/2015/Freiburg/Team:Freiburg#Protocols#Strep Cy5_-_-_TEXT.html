Regeneration of Tris NTA slides
from Chang AG Piehler
material: Imidazol, EDTA, HBS-buffer, HCl, NiCl
duration: … min
Always check for pH after using deionized water!
Prepare slide holder with 500 mM Imidazol
Incubate slide for 15 min
Prepare slide holder with 250 mM EDTA pH 7.5
Incubate slide for 15 min
Dip 3x in HBS buffer in slideholder A
Also wash tweezers!
Best step to store @ -20 °C
Prepare 100 mM HCl in HBS
Incubate 1 min with slides crossed
Dip 3x in HBS buffer in slideholder A
Prepare 10 mM NiCl solution
Incubate 3 min with slides crossed
Dip 3x in HBS buffer in slideholder B
Incubate in 500 mM Imidazol for 1 min
Dip 3x in HBS buffer in slideholder B
Prepare 1/5 HBS buffer dilution in aqua dest. (Control pH!)
Wash in diluted HBS buffer
