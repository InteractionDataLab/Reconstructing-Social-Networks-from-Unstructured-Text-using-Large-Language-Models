Isopropanol precipitation
Precipitation and concentration of plasmid DNA from midi-preps
material: 5M NaCl, Isopropanol, 70% EtOH
duration: 60 min
add 1/10 volume 5M NaCl
add 1 volume ice cold isopropanol
incubate for 30 min at -20°C
centrifuge 30 min, 4°C (pre-cool the centrifuge)
wash DNA pellet with 70% ethanol
resuspend in H2O
