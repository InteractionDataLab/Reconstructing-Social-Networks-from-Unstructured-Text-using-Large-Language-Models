Salmonella Antigen (dehydroxy acid dehydratase) and anti-dehydroxy acid dehydratase
Salmonella antigen was diluted 1:2 and 1:5. For the western blot, the purified anti-salmonella antibody was used 1:100. Antibody raised against the cmyc-tag of the anti-salomella was used 1:1000 (rabbit). Anti-rabbit 1:5000

Salmonella Antigen (dehydroxy acid dehydratase) and anti-dehydroxy acid dehydratase
Given that we could measure a binding of pIG15_1301 to pIG15_1501, we wanted to proof this binding event by western blot.  The primary antibody pIG15_1301 (anti-dehydroxy acid dehydratase) is selfmade by overexpression in E.coli and purified with Ni-NTA. These single chain antibodies contain beside the his-tag for purification an additional cmyc-tag. The antigen (pIG15_1501) does not contain any cmyc-tag. Therefore we used as secondary antibody anti-cmyc (rabbit). For the readout we are using chemilumineszenz immunoassay. So we used as third antibody the anti-rabbit Horseradish Peroxidase.

western blot of pIG15_1501 and pIG15_1301 with anti-his conjugated antibody
In addition to this western blot we also performed a western blot against the anit-his-Tag. There we determined the presence of our purified proteins, which are containing the his-tag.
The concentrations of the antibody were used in the following dilutions:
anti-his conjugated (1:1000)
anti-pIG15_1501 (1301) 1:100
anti-cmyc 1:1000
anti-rabbit HRP 1:5000
HA-tag-GFP-His-tag
As positive control in our measurement device, we are using GFP-His-Tag and anti-GFP biotinylated.  This binding event we determined by western blot.

purification of pET15_1003;1103;1703 and pIG15_1301;1501
the purification was performed according to Protein Purification on gravity flow columns
all steps were performed in the cold room (4°C) and no vacuum was used.
after the elution step, the samples were combined to 2,5 ml and desalted with specific columns for buffer exchange.
the final concentration of the buffer is 20mM Tris, 150mM NaCl and 30mM Imidazole
afterwards the protein concentration of the samples was determined

pET_Spy Bl1pLys
100ml LB (Amp+Cml) was inoculated with 1ml o/n culture
grow until OD600~0.5 and induced with 1mM IPTG
cells grow for 3h hours at 37°C
cell harvest and lysis after protocol
samples: 10' after induction, supernatant and pellet of the lysis → overexpression should be visible on the gel
15 mL LB (+Amp + Cml) was inoculated with pET_Spy BL21 pLys and grown o/n
Results
12.5 % SDS-Gel of the lysis of 100 mL BL21 pET_SpyC_GST culture.
The expected molecular weight of the SpyCatcher-GST-complex is around 32 kDa and thus may fit to the strong band in the pellet fraction gel lane.
SpyCatcher-GST protein band is only visible for the pellet fraction.
To confirm the results a second SDS-PAGE was performed, starting from the frozen lysate and pellet resuspension. This experiment confirms the first data that the SpyCatcher-GST fusion protein ist located in the pellet.
12.5 % second SDS-Gel of the lysis of 100 mL BL21 pET_SpyC_GST culture.
The used fusion protein seems to be not GST-SpyCatcher but GST-SpyTag. That accounts for the lower molecular weight. Test for solubility has to be repeated with new GST-SpyCatcher construct.
