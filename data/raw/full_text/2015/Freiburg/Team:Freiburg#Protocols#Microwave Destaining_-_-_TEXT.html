Coomassie microwave staining protocol
modified from Stefan, AG Roth
material:aqua dest, Coomassie staining solution, 20% NaCl solution
duration: 1h
staining and destaining
stain the gel in staining solution for 10min in an orbital shaker
remove staining solution and wash once with water
repeat the following steps 2-3 times
add water so that gel is covered and heat in microwave (800W ~ 0.5min) until solution starts to boil
incubate 5 min on orbital shaker
discard water and refill
wash the gel in aqua dest for 10 min
if bands are sufficiently visible take a picture
Possibly the use of 20% NaCl for at least 5 min may further increase the detection limit.
Original protocol from Simon Wischgoll
