Protocol Cell-free expression
How to express proteins cell-free from DNA templates
material: Mastermix, lysate, nuclease free water and DNA template
duration: Preparation 30-45 min + running time
Mastermix
Component
stock concentration
amount in 50 µl reaction [µl]
Creatine phosphate
80 mM

Final reaction
Component
stock concentration
amount in 50 µl reaction [µl]
Master mix
-
17.68
Lysate
-
22.5
DNA
at least 217 ng/µl
3250 - 5000 ng
H2O (nuclease free)
-
up to 50 µl
Implementation
incubate 2-4 hrs at 37 °C in autoclaved tubes or 96 well plate (low bind)
Remarks
add creatine phosphokinase last to mastermix
work quickly, sterile and as nuclease free as possible (on ice)
add DNA last to start reactions simultaneously
amount of lysate used can be varied (here 45%)
the used chemicals should have a high grade of purity
Certain counterions like Chlor and Sodium should be avoided
feed: adding 10 mM Mg(OAc) every 20 minutes can increase reaction output profoundly
Reaction is adapted from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany
