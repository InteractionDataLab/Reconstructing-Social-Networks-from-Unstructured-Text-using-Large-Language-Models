iRIf slide wash steps
iRIf slide wash steps after measurement/before new measurement
remarks concerning the protocol (author, adapted from etc.)
material: 0,1% SDS, 10% RBS, diH2O, Kimtechtuch
duration: Incubation in SDS o/n + ~10 mins for further washing
Add volume of added chemical (µL) (remarks, tips)
instructions time, speed, temperature (remarks, tips)
After measuring with iRIf device:
Fill slide-box with 0,1% SDS; incubate Slides o/n
rub slide surface with 0,1% SDS with Kimtechtuch
wash with diH2O from wash bottle
dry slides with cleaning wipe/nitrogenpistole
incubate in 10%ige RBS (glasbox)for 1-3 minutes; twist slides 1x within this time window
rub slide surface with 10% RBS with Kimtechtuch (RBS that is already on the slides is enough)
wash properly with diH2O
dry with nitrogenpistole
when completely dry (change position of the pincette at least one time to get rid of the water that is covered through it) sort slides into slidebox
plasma activate slides for 5 min
store slides in iRIf slide box
Wash pincettes before and after use with aceton (Caution: do not wash them in top of the H2O/Ethanol-waste, seperate waste!)
Slide „303“ is not properly cleanable, avoid using it
