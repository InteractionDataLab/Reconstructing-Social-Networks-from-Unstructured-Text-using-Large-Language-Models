PCR for biobricks + PCR for GFP insert (LS)
Antigens 6, 8, 10, 11, 17 and 18 will be amplified using primers with matching overlap for pSB1C3 for Gibson cloning. The plasmids pIG15_X01 containg antigen fragments will be used as template. For GFP amplification pQE-60 GFP will be used as template.

PCR for pOP Gibson (JN)
As the fragments for the pOP vector were wrongly cloned, there is a antibiotic resistance missing after the first Gibson Assembly. Therefore, colonies cannot be selected for taking up the plasmid. Yesterday we tried an approach with a 5 fragment Gibson Assembly but no colonies were growing on the plate overnight. The next approach is to assemble two and accordingly 3 fragments via PCR. We decided to use fragments 5, 1 and 2 for one reaction, where the antibiotic resistance would be restored. The other reaction should assemble fragments 3 and 4. The PCR reaction mixes were prepared as follows. For the first reactions, the primers pOOP_5fw and pOOP_2rv were used, for the second pOOP_3fw and pOOP_4rv. As template a 1:10 dilution of the prepped pJet constructs (1) from yesterday was prepared. From this dilution 1µl per fragment was used.

Gibson Assembly of PCR products pOP_512 and pOP_34 for pOP (JN)
1.5µl of pOP_512 and 3.5µl of pOP_34 were added to Gibson Master Mix
after 5min of incubation at RT, 5µl were used for a transformation into E.coli TOP10 according to protocol
the rest was incubated for 1h at 50°C, 3min at RT, 3min on ice
then another transformation was performed
both were plated on Amp plates
PCR for SpyCatcher amplification (RE)
The SpyCatcher was amplified with two different reverse primers. oIG15_SpyC_02 a HindIII restrcition site, oIG15_SpyC_03 a BamHI site. PCR fragments obtained by 02 are named 1-2, the others 1-3.
