pIG15_1301 C43
in this experiment the protein anti dihydroxyacid dehydratase (His-Tag) should be purified by Ni-NTA
500ml culture was harvested by centrifugation, 5000xg, 20min, 4°C
for cell disruption the pellet (4g) was resuspended in 30ml lysis buffer (20mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 10mM Imidazol, pH 8,0)
sonification was performed 5min, 6xcycles on ice
afterwards 1:1000 PMSF (stock 300mM) was added
to get rid of the inclusion bodies, the cell lysate was centrifuged 10 000xg, 30min, 4°C
the supernatant was used for the protein purification
Protein purification
400ul slurry of the Ni-NTA beads were equilibrated with 2ml lysis buffer (2x times)
supernatant and beads were incubated for 1h, 4°C under rotating conditions
by centrifugation (500xg, 1min, 4°C) the flowthrough was taken und stored on ice for furhter SDS-PAGE Analysis
the beads were washed five times with wash buffer (20mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 20mM Imidazol, pH 8,0)
to improve the washing step the imidazole concentration was increased up to 30mM for one washing step
for the elution of anti dehydroxyacid dehydratase, 500ul of the elution buffer (20mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 500mM Imidazol, pH 8,0) was used. The elution was performed five times.
the samples are stored at -80°C
Results

To confirm, whether the gIII (secretion signal to periplasm) is cleaved off, western blot should be performed with anti-His Tag antibdoy.

Annotated gel picture of the cell lysis. black: double bands may indicate the desired protein expression. orange: absence of double bands.
In the whole cell lysates there is no clear protein band visible
Thought of a double band wherefrom the upper on may be consist of the desired protein of about 85 kDa (signified with arrows)
