Where does life begin? Do we feel like working with living creatures when handling bacterial cell cultures? Where is the difference between natural and artificial?
</EM><P>
These were only some of the questions we were faced with when agreeing to contribute to the Freiburg participation in an Europe-wide theater project in the framework of SYNENERGENE called “Re-engineering life or Do we want to be unlimited”. The aim of this european initiative was to initiate a discussion about the rise of synthetic biology with its risks and benefits and accompany the development from an artistic perspective. The project was organized by a group of humanities' students collaborating with directors and researchers from the University of Freiburg and the Theatre of Freiburg.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content_box"><H2>New Aspects of All Day Work</H2><DIV class="level2"><P>
At first, four members of our iGEM Team took part in a discussion with the participants of the project. We were really surprised to get to know a group of students which was not only interested in scientific facts and in our participation in iGEM but also in our personal attitude towards ethical implications of science. It was interesting to see two groups of people from totally different backgrounds coming together and exchanging their thoughts. Questions from a philosophic point of view were answered in the context of science what led to amazing conversations. All of us tried to find a common language, no matter what background we were coming from, humanities or natural science. This was extremely exciting and and offered everyone the possibility to get new perspectives. The concern that we would be confronted with deep distrust towards synthetic biology soon vanished and we were able to have an open discussion with the other students instead. In fact, we were astonished of how much they wanted to know about the science of synthetic biology.

Crossing-over: Speed-dating with interested visitors in Freiburg. The statue of the mammoth represents the possible abilities of modern science and biology to change the present as we know it.
</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
The project culminated in a weekend of theater plays and public talks all dedicated to synthetic biology and its impact on society. 
</P><P>
We were invited to participate in a speed-dating like discussion with interested visitors. As part of so-called &quot;expert-teams&quot; we had members of our iGEM Team at several tables during this speed-dating discussion. For approximately one hour visitors could switch between the different tables and talk to experts from biology, philosophy, arts, theology and politics. Every eight minutes a gong announced the next round so that we had eight minutes to discuss our project and synthetic biology in general with a group of three to five interested visitors on our table. The interest of the visitors was focused on many different things, some wanted to know a lot about our project or our motivation to participate in iGEM, some were most interested in the iGEM Competition as such and some deeply discussed synthetic biology with us. Over all, during these conversations we got really good feedback concerning the DiaCHIP, even if some people did not approve the research on synthetic biology and genetic engineering in general. Anyways, the idea of our project and the possibility of a chip that could detect hundreds of diseases in one measurement sounded like a really good and promising idea to the visitors.
</P><P>
After this round of discussions a panel discussion with Prof. Dr. Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent (Philosophy, Université Paris Sorbonne) and Prof. Dr. Alfred Nordmann (Philosophy, TU Darmstadt) followed and gave a quite interesting insight into synthetic biology from a philosophical point of view. The motivation of research in synthetic biology was only one topic that was discussed and where they did not completely agree with one another.
</P><P>
During the event we did not only meet visitors of the public but also some members of the iGEM Teams Tübingen and Darmstadt, with whom we shared an interesting and motivating evening.
