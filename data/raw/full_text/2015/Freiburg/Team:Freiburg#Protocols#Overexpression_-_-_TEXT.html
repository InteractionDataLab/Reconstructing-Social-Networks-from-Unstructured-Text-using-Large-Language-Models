Protein overexpression and purification in E. coli
His-Tag; Strep-Tag protein purification
remarks concerning the protocol (author, adapted from etc.)
material: peptone, NaCl, yeast extract, IPTG , …
duration: … min
Protein overexpression
o/n culture is inoculated 1:100 in LB-medium (corresponding antibiotics 1:1000)
cells grow at 37°C until OD600 ~ 0.5
after that cell culture is induced with a certain IPTG (Isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranosid)
cells were set to a specific temperature for a specific time
the culture is harvested by centrifugation (20min, 5000 g, 4°C)
discard the supernatant and freeze the pellet at -20°C

10 g peptone (w/v) [or 10 g Bacto-tryptone?]
