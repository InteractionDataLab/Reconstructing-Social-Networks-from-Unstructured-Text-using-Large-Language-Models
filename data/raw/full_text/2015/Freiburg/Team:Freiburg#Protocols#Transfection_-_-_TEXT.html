Transfection of Cells
Transfection of Cells
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: 30 min
The transfection is carried out at a density of 50-70%. The following information refers to the transfection of cells on 10 cm plate.
Just before the addition of the transfection mix  25 µM chloroquine were added to the medium.
The amount of DNA used was 12μg. The final volume was 1.6 ml.
First, the DNA was treated with the appropriate volume ddH2O, which was calculated from the discrepancy of the final volume
then mixed with other ingredients and 99.2 ul of sterile 2 M CaCl2.
Then 800 ul 2x HBS were added dropwise while vortexing to the approach.
The transfection mixture was dropped onto the cells within 10 minutes.
.
2x HBS (500ml): 8 g NaCl; 0,37 g KCl; 106,5 mg Na2HPO4; 1 g Dextrose; 5 g Hepes (pH 7,05)
