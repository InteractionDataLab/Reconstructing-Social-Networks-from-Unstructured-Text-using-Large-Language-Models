Team Freiburg 2015
This year’s iGEM Team Freiburg consists of 18 students of various scientific fields including chemistry, physics, biology, informatics and medicine. Our team is supervised by Jun. Prof. Maximilian Ulbrich (BIOSS), Dr. Nicole Gensch (BIOSS) and Dr. Günter Roth (ZBSA). Furthermore get advice and support from former iGEM participants who are sharing their experiences and knowledge with us.
