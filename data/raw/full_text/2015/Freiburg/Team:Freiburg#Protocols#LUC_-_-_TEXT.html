Implementation
To characterize a reaction, the luciferase plasmid was added to the expression mix and the expression is run using desired conditions (standard: 2 h at 37°C, no shaking). Afterwards, the reaction is stopped by putting it on ice. Inside a well of a 96-well microplate, 20 µl of the reaction are mixed with 20 µl of dilution reagent, creating a 1:2 dilution. If a 1:4 dilution is demanded, 20 µl of the first dilution are added to another 20 µl dilution reagent, otherwise they are discard-ed. 50 µl of the luciferase assay reagent is added to the reaction only seconds before the measurement is started. The microplate reader is set to perform a full spectrum emission scan (400 - 700 nm) of each well. Because of the kinetic temperature dependency of luciferase, it was minded to perform every scan at 25°C.
Remarks
The Reaction Reagent tends to get contaminated so regular preparation is necessary
