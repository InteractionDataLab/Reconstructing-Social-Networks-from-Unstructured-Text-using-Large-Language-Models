		During our project we used an emerging new technology called <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Project/iRIf" target="_blank">iRIf</A> to measure antigen-antibody interactions. In the case of our DiaCHIP we focused on the diagnostic possibilities arising from this measurement method and the advantages associated with this new diagnostic device. To make the DiaCHIP accessible to medical staff all over the world, we rebuilt the measuring device. Compared to the high-tech version of the iRIF device our reproduction shows a similar capability of measuring protein interactions while it only costs a fraction of money ($50 000<SUP><A class="fn_top" href="#fn_1" id="fnt_1" name="fnt_1">1)</A></SUP> vs. $500). 

With our rebuilt device it is possible to measure any kind of protein-protein interaction thus we are giving future iGEM teams the possibility to investigate interactions of different parts and use our device for their projects. We offer this new method to all iGEM teams and provide an easy to follow step-by-step construction manual, including a list of needed devices.

To this day, common diagnostic methods both in industrialized and in developing countries have restrictions. Some are expensive, time-consuming, can only be operated by trained personnel, or are difficult to store and most are a combination of these. In the course of our iGEM project, we have developed a device and method, that tackles all these limitations at once. The DiaCHIP provides great capacity for multiplexing as many diseases can be detected simultaneously. In combination with a microfluidic system it allows fast and specific diagnosis. The detection of antigens present in a patients blood serum is detected by their interaction with their respective immobilized antigens. The antigen microarray can be produced cell-free from a DNA template, which offers a more stable alternative to protein arrays. The array production and the detection of interaction happen in the same device for which we provide a detailed construction manual. Thereby the DiaCHIP outcompetes conventional diagnostics, in speed as well as in affordability!
