Protein stamping with PDMS
Protocol for protein stamping with PDMS stamps
according to protocol from Günter
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: … min
Cut out stamps from PDMS-template
Wash with aqua dest. if neccessary
Pipette 50-60 µL of Protein-solution and disperse on surface (watch the orientation of the stamp!)
Incubate for 30 min - 1h at RT
Remove protein-solution from surface with pipette (can be reused)
Pipette PBS-buffer on stamp surface (fast!!)
Wash stamp with aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Stamp protein in the middle of the glass slide (press slightly)
control successful stamping by breathing on glass slide
Store slide at 4 °C
