Protein Purification on gravity flow columns
improved protocol for classical gravity flow columns
material:Gravity flow columns, 50% Ni-NTA agarose in storage buffer, ddH<sub<2</sub>O, Lysis buffer
duration:
All buffers have to be degassed before by applying sonfication for example
To increase the flow though velocity the collection tubes (falcon tubes with cap) were connected to a vacuum pump with interposed pressure regulation. beware of applying too much pull to avoid ait bubble formation near the diaphragma.
column packing
wash columns with 5 mL of aqua dest
close columns with plug
slowly pipette 1 mL of 1:1 NTA-agarose/stoarge buffer slurry on the diaphragma
let the agarose settle out
open the tube and wash the agarose with 2-3 mL lysis buffer
loading
change the falcon tube to elute the sample in
pipette the cell lysate onto the column and let almost flow through
collect flow-through and change collection tube again
wash with 5 mL washing buffer and collect FT
change collection tube
elute 5 times with 500 µL of elution buffer
every time the liquid surface is near the bed: add new buffer and collect the flow though that accumulated until then
washing
add 500µL - 1mL of total elution buffer and let flow through
wash with 3 mL of aqua dest to remove imidazol
add 1 mL of 20 % ethanol and let flow though until around 0.5 mL left
close column with plug and store @ 4°C
reusing
equilibrate the column with lysis buffer as described above
use one column only for one type of protein!
