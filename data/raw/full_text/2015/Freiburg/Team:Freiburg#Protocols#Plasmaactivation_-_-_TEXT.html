PDMS-PDITC
protocol for PDITC surface on flow cells
According to protocol from AG Roth
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: … min
Slide preparation
Name the slide
Clean slides by washing with ethanol and rubbing (per hand, with glove)
flush with aqua dest.
Dry with wafergun
Activate in plasma generator : gas flow 80 L/h, time 1 min
APTES
Prepare APTES-solution:   for 5 slides:
18 mL ethanol (90%)
1 mL dd aqua (5%)
1 mL APTES (5%)
Incubate slides over night at RT in slideholder (transparent, sealed with parafilm) filled with APTES-solution
Wash each flow cell individually with ethanol
immerse for 5 min in ethanol in slideholder
quickly dispose ethanol and dry flow cells with wafergun
Put slides in new slideholder and bake them in oven at 70 °C for 60-90 min
PDITC
Prepare PDITC-solution: for 5 slides:
pyridin 2.0 mL
DMF 18.0 mL
PDITC 40 mg
Cool down slides in slidebox with wafergun (go close with gun)
Incubate slides in slideholder for 2 h filled with PDITC-solution at RT
Discard PDITC-solution
Fill with ethanol and discard ethanol
Wash 2 x 5 min in slideholder with ethanol
Fill with ethanol and discard ethanol once more
Dry with wafergun
stock in N2 atmosphere in box wrapped with parafilm
storage >5 days
