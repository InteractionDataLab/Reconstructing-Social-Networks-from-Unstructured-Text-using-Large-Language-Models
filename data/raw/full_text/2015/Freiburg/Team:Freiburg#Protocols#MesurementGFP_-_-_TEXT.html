Measurement of GFP Expression
material: chemicals, used kits, …
duration: 90 min
Measurement of expressed GFP
All fluorescence measurements were performed with a microplate reader in blach plates with transparent bottom
As Exitation wavelength 480nm were choosen
Emission was measured at 520nm or a full spectrum was taken from 500 to 700 nm
Reactions were either performed in a tube and transferred to the microplate after the cell-free reaction or directly performed inside the platereader
when the reaction was performed inside the Platreader the wells were covered with foil to avoid evaporation
After the reaction and Measurement samples were stored at 4°C for further folding or directly frozen at -20°C
for a ensurence of sucessful expression of GFP an Westernblot was performed
