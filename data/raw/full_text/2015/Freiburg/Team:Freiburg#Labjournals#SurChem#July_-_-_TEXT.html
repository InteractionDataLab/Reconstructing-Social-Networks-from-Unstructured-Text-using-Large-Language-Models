another anti-Phy was used, because the one which was used in the first measurement was empty and also Phillip told us, that this one should bind better
Results
Binding of anti-phyA to phyA was not observed in RIfs
much of the protein was washed away from the spotted spot.
We have to take lower concentrations for spotting (100-400 ug/ml)
no Anti-tYFP to tYFP binding could be detected
to few tYFP on the slides because all proteins in Lysate bind to PDITC
should use specific surface (e.g. Ni-NTA, Halo) next time, where only tYFP binds
Slide 303: ROI selection
Slide 303: binding curves
Slide 303: Inverted QP during initial buffer step: Shows that already much of the PhyA is flushed away from the spot

Results
there might be a very weak a-tYFP/tYFP binding
concentration of expressed tYFP is too low for a convincing signal
Binding curve for S1: Only with lots of zooming anti-tYFP can be seen to bind tYFP (spot 4) within the binding curves (Exp. 36b)
Quotient picture (before/after anti-tYFP): Weak signal for Spot 4 can be seen
Binding curve for S2: Only with lots of zooming anti-tYFP can be seen to bind tYFP (spot 4) within the binding curves (Exp. 36b)
Quotient picture that was taken for spot marking

Two slides were spotted. For first slide the (max.) concentrations of the Antigens were used. For the second slide the second spot of each Antigen was spotted diluted (100 ug/ml).
2015.07.24
Experiment/Protocol
After incubating for 13h at 4°C all spots were removed with pipette
slides were then blocked with BSA (10 mg/ml) 2x 10 min at room temperature
1x PBS buffer was flooded over slides before removing the spotting mask and washing in PBS 2x 10 min (each time stored at 4°C)
Then a washing step in 1/10 diluted PBS (with aqua dest.) followed (also at 4°C)
Slides were dried with wafer gun and stored at 4°C in humid atmosphere
After 15 min slides were put back in PBS for 10 min because of Stefan
Talking to Günter confirmed that storing the slides dry prevents the His-Tag from leaving Ni/NTA so the slides were dipped into PBS (1/10 diluted, dried with wafer gun and stored at 4°C in humid atmosphere
slides were blocked again in BSA 10 mg/ml for 30 min
Then they were washed 10 min in PBS 1x and 10 min in 1/10 diluted PBS (in aqua dest), eacht time at 4°C
Slides were dried and measured in iRIf

positive control (GFP) worked
negative control didn't work (bBSA was detectable with Strep-Cy5 although it should not bind to Ni-NTA)
Anti-His at least bound to Tetanus and Samonella
monoclonal antibodies did'nt bind
for HIV, HCV: maybe concentration was too low
Binding curve of the second slide: No specific antibody/antigen binding can be seen
Binding curve of S1: results are equal to S2 (anti-Salm not present within this plot, since huge airbubble before the step destroyed further measurement)
Experiment 35: Influence of focus on fluorescence intensity
2015.07.21
Considerations
check if there is an impact on the fluorescence intensity when the photo is taken out of focus (compared to in focus photo)
Experiment/Protocol
three photos of a spot were taken and evaluated, one of them in focus, the others out of focus
Results
Compared fluorescence intensities of images from the same spot taken with different focus calibrations
there is no dependency between the fluorescence intensity and the focusing
Experiment 34: Influence of objcetive on fluorescence intensity
2015.07.21
Considerations
check if fluorescence images made with the 10x objective are brighter than with the 4x objective
how much brighter
Experiment/Protocol
made image of the same spot with 10x objective as well as the 4x objective
measured 3 spots and compared fluorescence intensities
Results
Compared fluorescence intensities of images from the same spot taken with the 10x objective and the 4x objective
as expected the images taken with the 10xobjective are brigther
3-10 time as bright as the 4x objective images
comparison of images taken with the 4x and 10x objectives is difficult → use only one objective for spot evaluation
Experiment 33: Photobleaching of GFP
2015.07.21
Considerations
determine impact of photobleaching on the fluorescence measurement of GFP
Experiment/Protocol
took a photo every minute of 3 individual spots for 10 min while constantly illuminating them with blue light
slides from experiment 30 were used
Results
Impact of photobleaching of GFP spots on measured fluorescence intensities.
→ photobleaching effect negligible for the duration of our experiments

Evaluation
Measured fluorescence values were corrected by mean intensity for PBS
for each dilution the mean value of the corrected intensities was calculated
A calibration curve was made from the values for Max GFP (c = 1mg/ml)
The concentrations of the other GFP solutions were calculated by using the equation obtained from the calibration and multiplying with the dilution factor.
The final concentration was obtained by calculating the mean value for all 5 dilutions. The error corresponds to the standard deviation of these 5 values.

Mean Fluorescence Intensities of slides 2 and 3 with measured background for each spot.
Mean Fluorescence Intensities of slides 2 and 3 with background already substracted.
The diagramm shows, that His-GFP was successfully immobilized on the Ni-NTA surface, while GFP without Tag didn't bind very good
the fluorescence of our lysate was much stronger than that of the purified His-GFP
the positive control (nT-GFP on PDITC) didn't show intense fluorescence, because nT-GFP-Lysate was used
To-Do
Repeat dilution series (2 slides, 5 concentrations: 2 spots each, 1:1, 1:4, 1:16, 1:64, 1:256)
