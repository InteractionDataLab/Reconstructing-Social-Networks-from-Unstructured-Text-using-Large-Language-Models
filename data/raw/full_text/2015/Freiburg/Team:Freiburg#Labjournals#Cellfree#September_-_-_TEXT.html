Cell-free Expression of HA-GFP-His6-His6, His10-GFP-Spy and GFP Bielefeld with KK and Promega
(Luisa)
50 µl reactions were incubated at 37°C in the platereader (480/520 nm) for 4 hours in a 384 well plate. afterwards the foil covering the plate was removed a spectrum was obtained
comparison to GFP 1mg/ml dilutions
