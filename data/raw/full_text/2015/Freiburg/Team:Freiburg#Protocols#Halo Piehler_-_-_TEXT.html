Halosurface from AG Piehler
protocol for functionalizing glass slides with halotag ligand
protocol adapted from Jacob Piehler
material: PLL-PEG-HTL, acetone, isopropanol, aqua dest.
duration: ca. 30 min
dilute PLL-PEG-HTL in pH 7.5 buffer with 0.5 mg/ml concentration
clean slides with aceton, isopropanol and aqua dest.
dry slides with nitrogengun
plasma activate slides for 10 min with a gasflow of 60-80 l/h
sandwich slides with 15 µl of PLL-PEG-HTL solution in cross formation for 5-10 min
wash slides with aqua dest.
dry slides with nitrogengun
storable at -20°C for a few month
