TOP10 pILS2 and pILS3 10°C
because not all the colonies grew properly the experiment was repeated for TOP10 pILS2 and pILS3 at 10°C
11.08.2015
the protocol on the iGEM website was followed:
The samples were diluted to OD600 = 0.5:
From all 60 samples the OD600 was measured using a nanoDrop
samples were diluted to achieve a final OD600 of 0.5
dilution was checked by again measuring the optical density of the samples
in case of a value outside 0.5 +- 5% the diluation was repeated based on the new values
fluorescence was measured using a platereader an an excitation of 485nm with a bandpassfilter of 20nm and emission at 530nm with the filter width.
all fluorescence data was measured three times in three 96-well plates (technical replicates)
10.08.2015
AS the BL21 strain carries the same resistance (Cml) as the plasmid does and it wasnot possible to sort out transformed colonies by using the fluorescence as guide we decided not to use BL21 in the study
from each plate two test tubes with 5 mL LB medium (+Cml) were inoculated
grown them for 8 h on 37°C, 220 rpm
after 8 h transfered half of the test tubes to 10°C
09.08.2015
For the other 2 strains: Three colonies of each strain were picked and stricken out on plate
incubation o/n @ 37°C
08.08.2015
Used E.coli strains are TOP10 (cloning strain) and Bl21pLysS + Arctic Express (expression strain) Each construct was transformed into the different strain. Constructs:
Interlab positiv
Interlab negativ
pILS 1 (2)
pILS 2 (2)
pILS 3 (1)
The antibiotic resistance of the plasmid is chloramphenicol. The expression strain Bl21pLysS has the same resistance. For o/n cultures only the visual positiv colonies (expression of gfp → greenish colonies will be choosen. Due to the fact of having no resistance (TOP10) and another antibiotic resistance (gentamycin) for Arctic Expression the selection by these strain is easier.
transformation was performed according to the protocol Transformation

NEB Cloner proposed 5-15 min @ 37°C but digest over night should also be possible
digest was carried out for 2.5h @ 37 in Thermocycler
sample was loaded on a free lane of a before used 1% agarose gel
5µL 1kb ladder was used
Results
Lane of digested GFP.
Only one band is visible so the digest was not succesfull
Additionally the 1kb-ladder was not visible on the gel.
Before further experiments are carried out, the DNA from the second miniprep has to be sequenced to prevent the right digest of the wrong DNA!

1% agarose gel was loaded and run 45 min @ 110V
Digest of the samples with Pst1 and Spe1 (for the backbones) and Xba1 (for the insert) respectively. Sample loading should have been all three backbones and then the insert, but samples seem to be swapped.
Results
samples seem to be swapped
The GFP insert was assigned to the first construct with about kbp length → There the digest may not have worked and therfore only one band is visible
The other bands were cut out and marked as Insert 1 to 3 because assignment to the different samples was not clear.
It is additionally unclear, if there has been succesfull digestion because the loss of 35 bp can't be seen on the gel
The GFP-insert digest will be done again
Backbone samples were stored @ 4°C
22.07.2015
samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and run @ 110V for 30 min
