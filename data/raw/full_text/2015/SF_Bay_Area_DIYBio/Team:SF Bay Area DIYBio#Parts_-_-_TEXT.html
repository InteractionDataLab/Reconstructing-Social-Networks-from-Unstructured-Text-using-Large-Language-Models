Ava_3858 demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) synthase
BBa_K1839000
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 contains a 4-gene cluster Ava_3858 to Ava_3855 that codes for a biosynthetic pathway producing the mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) shinorine. Genes Ava_3858 and Ava_3857 encode demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) synthase and O-methyltransferase (O-MT), respectively, which transform sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (SHP) from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle into 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG), the core structure of mycosporines.
Ava_3857 O-methyltransferase (O-MT)
BBa_K1839001
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 contains a 4-gene cluster Ava_3858 to Ava_3855 that codes for a biosynthetic pathway producing the mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) shinorine. Genes Ava_3858 and Ava_3857 encode demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) synthase and O-methyltransferase (O-MT), respectively, which transform sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (SHP) from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle into 4-deoxygadusol (4-DG), the core structure of mycosporines.
Ava_3856 ATP-grasp ligase
BBa_K1839002
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 contains a 4-gene cluster Ava_3858 to Ava_3855 that codes for a biosynthetic pathway producing the mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) shinorine. Ava_3856 encodes and ATP-grasp like enzyme that catalyzes the addition of glycine to demethyl 4-deoxygadusol (DDG) to form mycosporine-glycine.
