Manali Dwarakanath
Manali graduated with a PhD in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology from National University of Singapore in May 2015. She now lives in the Bay Area and is excited to be a part of BioCurious and iGEM2015!
Milo Toor
I am a recent college graduate with a BS in Computer Science. I developed an interest in genetics as an upperclassman in college, but opted not to pursue a degree-- instead, I now work at a bioinformatics startup in Oakland, which is focused on genome interpretation for clinical diagnostics. I hope to transition my career into genetic engineering, and plan to attend graduate school in the relatively near future.

He has extensive experience developing software in C, C++, MATLAB, Python, Visual Basic and many other programming languages. He has been a Visiting Scholar at HP Labs developing computer vision algorithms and software for mobile devices. He has worked as a contractor at NASA Ames Research Center involved in the research and development of image and video processing algorithms and technology. He has published articles on the origin and evolution of life, the exploration of Mars, and cheap access to space. He has a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He works for a well-known computer company.
Nikola Nikolov
Ph.D
2005-2011 PhD in Nuclear Physics at University of Tennessee
2011-2013 Postdoc in Astrophysics at Louisiana State University
2013 - current, New Product Engineer at KLA-Tencor Corp. Background: Physics, coding, algorithms.
Jay Hanson
Background in software. Biocurous member since 2012. Worked on bioluminescence project. Familiar with many synthetic biology techniques. Working on testing a biomarker for metastatic melanoma. Looking forward to working on iGEM project.
David Marash-Whitman
I am a recent graduate of Claremont McKenna College with majors in Biology and Government. I hope to build a career in synthetic biology designing biological solutions for unmet needs. That said, I know I have a lot to learn and for the time being I am trying to accumulate as much experience as possible. Currently, my engagements range from iGEM to other work at BioCurious to my new job at OncoMed Pharmaceuticals and a biology internship at NASA.
Andrew Elkins
I am a Computational Biology student at Berkeley City College. I have some prior experience with web design/development. I also used to be a cook in fine dining.
Phillip Wantuck
Recent bay area transplant from New York. I have a Chemistry degree from Penn State and a MS in Materials Science and Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology.
I have spent the past 7 years working for Xerox in various engineering and R&D positions working with novel and performance polymer, fluoropolymer and rubber compounds. I also have composite formulation experience with graphene, CNT's, nano diamonds as well as multiple other types of organic and inorganic thermally conductive and abrasion resistant fillers. I have taken these formulations from initial conception to prototype / field test for use in multiple products. Almost all of the aforementioned development work relied on Designed Experiments for a rapid 1 year development cycle.
I currently work for Agilent Technologies as a Sr. Process Engineer in the Microarray manufacturing center (Oligo's, sure select, surefish, etc...). I have no background in biology, however, I am looking to expand my knowledge in this area.
