The BioSunBlock iGEM team is made possible by the combined efforts of our team of 36+ biohackers and citizen scientists working out of two open community labs in the San Francisco Bay Area: Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA and BioCurious in Sunnyvale, CA. The BioSunBlock project is open to collaborators of all skill levels and from all walks of life. We are excited to enter our BioSunBlock project into the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) 2014 competition. We are excited to be part of a larger global community consisting of students and biohackers from over 30 countries! Below are those that made this project a reality.

Our Team
Everyone on the team was involved in some capacity. We had weekly, and sometimes bi-weekly team meetings to plan, and experiments throughout the week as schedules allowed. Specific project contributions include:
James Wantuck, Philip Wantuck contributed to the discussion around Ethical, Legal, Human, and Safety implications of the project.
Patrik D’haeseleer, Jay Hanson, helped with the DNA design, including codon optimization, and checking for restriction and protease sites.
Many participated in lab work.
Maria and many more helped with the IndieGogo fundraising campaign
Jay Hanson, Eric Harness, and Rikke ordered reagents
Advait, Patrik, and Maria kept us on track with iGEM deliverables
Eric Acker, April, and Maria designed our graphics
Eric Harness led a class on Rolling Circle Amplification
Many attended Eric’s hands on class on Rolling Circle Amplification
Lorant Toth, Advait, and Maria helped with web layout and information on the iGEM wiki
