Researched UV sources and built UV exposure rig to mimic solar UV
UVA: 320-400nm. “Tanning” wavelengths. Long-term free radical damage
UVB: 280-320nm. Causes sunburn and direct DNA damage
UVC: 100-280nm. Rapid skin and retinal damage (e.g.: germicidal UV in BSC)
We want to mimic solar UV: broad-band UVA+UVB, but not UVC! After testing many UV sources, we settled on:
UVB basking lamp for pet reptiles
UVA nail curing lamp
Determined exposure level needed for >4 log decrease in CFU
UV kill curve was generated for E.coli HB101, to establish baseline exposure for Directed Evolution
We also tested HB101 + pGLO plasmid, to check if GFP has a protective effect.
Demonstrated GFP is NOT an effective UV protectant for E.coli
4 log decrease in viable cells after 75min for HB101, 30min for pGLO
If anything, pGLO has a negative effect on UV resistance!
Synthesized and transformed A. variabilis shinorine biosynthesis genes
Submitted one gene (Ava_3856) to Parts Registry
Demonstrated that we produced UV absorbing compounds
MAA’s can be extracted with methanol:
Grow 20ml culture overnight in TSB
Spin down & wash in saline 2x
Extract in 2ml methanol at 4C overnight
Pellet at 10,000rpm, collect supernatant
Collect UV absorption spectrum:
E. coli HB101 (control)
HB101+Ava_3858-3855 (full shinorine pathway)
HB101+Ava_3858-3856 (up to mycosporine-glycine only)
Yay - we’re producing UV absorbing compounds! Further analysis will have to wait until we get our HPLC up and running...
