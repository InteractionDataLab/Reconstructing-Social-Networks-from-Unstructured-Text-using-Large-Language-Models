Design
1. Express Shinorine biosynthesis pathway in E. coli, also explored other UV absorbers, like GFP (!) and PABA pathway Measure MAA production based on UV absorption spectrum
2. Improve UV resistance in E. coli using Directed Evolution!
3. We need to establish how much UV to expose the cells to, to provide the right selective pressure for Directed Evolution: kill most cells, not all.
4. Expose to different UV durations, and count colony forming units
5. Quantify UV resistance based on kill curve of E. coli under UV exposure
6. Sequence plasmid and figure out what improvements evolution came up with
