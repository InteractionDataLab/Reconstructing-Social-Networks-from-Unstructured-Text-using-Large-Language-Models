5 mL LB plus CM were inoculated with colony 1 to 6 an grown at 37 °C
PCR products of colonies were checked on 1 % agarose gel and visualized with EtBr under UV light
Results & Outlook:
Cryo stocks will be prepared and Plasmid will be prepped.
▼2015-09-02  Cryostock and Miniprep of RFC
Cryostock:
500 µL of oN culture and 500 µL of autoclaved 40 % glycerol solution were mixed. Stock was stored at -80 °C.
Miniprep:
Plasmid was purified using QIAprep Miniprep kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.
An aliquot was sent to GATC for sequencing using xxmj006xx and xxmj07xx.
Sequence was confirmed.
Outlook:
ivT will be performed: testing the three option that will be described in our RFC
