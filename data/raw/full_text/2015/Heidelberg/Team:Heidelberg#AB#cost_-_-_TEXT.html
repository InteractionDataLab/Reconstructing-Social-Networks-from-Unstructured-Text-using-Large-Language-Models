Comparison of the cost for the user of antibodies and aptabodies
Cost of antibodies for single use (smalles available size)
The prices of antibodies and aptabodies both in development as well as per use differs drastically. To get an accurate number of cost per use for antibodies, the prices of 4896 aptabodies offered by Thermo Fisher Scientific have been collected and plotted into a histogram. Thermo Fisher Scientific offers only one size for purchase, this equals then the price for the end user for single use. The aptabodies have been sampled pseudo-randomly from the Thermo Fisher Scientific database of "40,000+" antibodies, no currency conversion has been performed and shipping is not considered.
For comparison, the approximate calculated price of an aptabody is shown, see below how this cost is calculated.
