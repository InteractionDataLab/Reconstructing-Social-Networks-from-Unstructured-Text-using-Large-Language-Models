Outreach
Team is successfully registered!
Judging form is completed and submitted!
Project is showcased on the iGEM wiki!
Proper list attributions!
Part:BBa_K1614002 is documented and submitted!
Part:BBa_K1614016 successfully validated and documented!
Part:BBa_K1614016 submitted to the registry!
Spread knowledge about synthetic biology in the city of Heidelberg!
Held a panel discussion which was lifestreamed and simultaniously translated into English!
Cooperated with iGEM Michigan. We calculated aptamers for their setup using our MAWS software
Improved Part:BBa_K1614019 by making it switchable via ATP!
Demonstrated a functional prototype!
Developed a software in close contact with the wetlab work!
Optimised our software until it can be run fully functional in the timeframe the demo suite offers!
AptaBodies
Fast and cheap alternative to Antibodies
MAWS can generate specific AptaBodies against each and every protein of interest
Easy to design for proteins for which no antibodies are available yet
Real-time Small molecule sensing
Validation of our JAWS Software
Sensing of ATP concentrations in biochemical reactions
Real time monitoring of in vitro transcriptions
Cystic fibrosis
Functional proof of cleavage activity in vivo
De novo construction of a new active site in twin ribozymes
Proposeal of Ribozyme as therapeutic agent in Cystic fibrosis
Labelling and vizualization
A novel strategy using mimicking HRP DNAzyme can be used for labeling of sDNA and RNA
Modeling and Software validation
Fully automatable high-throughput workflow to screen aptamer and allosteric DNAzyme candidates
Our system is able to design aptamer candidates and give estimates for the affinity and switching behavior
The aptamers created by our software were experimentally proven to work
Establishment of a cleavage activated HRP-mimicking DNAzyme that can be applied in real life screening assays
Standardization
A novel Standard (RFC 110) is useful for cloning and expression of functional RNA .
