[…] The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature. The globe began with sea, so to 
speak”, Nemo said while the “Nautilus” was cruising with a school of hammerhead sharks deep 
beneath the waves.</I>

And the captain was right. Deep in the ocean billions of years ago the miracle of nature took place as 
a pool of small molecules evolved to self-replicating lifeforms. The flagship role in this development 
was probably taken by the most versatile class of molecules in the history of life: <STRONG>RNA</STRONG>. 

Seemingly random nucleotides happened to be in the right order to form the first biocatalysts that 
made life on the blue planet possible. Today we know those miracles of nature as ribozymes. Inspired 
by this, humanity took evolution into their own hands to create aptamers – nucleic acids capable of 
encaging molecules. This allows for the detection of virtually anything. Still this process has been 
tedious and time consuming much like fishing with a rod in an ocean. We want to revolutionize this 
former evolutionary process and want to make it swift like a shark tracking down its prey. 

Yet to really bring out the strengths of these simple yet powerful molecules just comprised of A, U, C 
and G we want to combine aptamers and ribozymes to create a toolset for the synthetic biologist to 
create allosteric ribozymes able to sense a variety of molecules. Therefore, we hope to introduce the 
true origins of life and the capabilities of functional RNA to iGEM. <STRONG>Join us as we sail forth into new 
waters of synthetic biology. </STRONG></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12"><DIV class="panel panel‐default"><DIV class="panel‐heading"><H3 class="basicheader">Further content</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel‐body"><DIV class="row" style="padding: 10px;"><DIV class="col-lg-4"><DIV class="panel panel‐default panel-preview-small cf-notebook"><DIV class="imagewrapper"><DIV class="imagewrapperinlineheader">

                                            It’s done. We’ve finally decided upon a logo. It’s beautiful, it’s blue, it’s fishy *wink*. The next step was to choose a color scheme and a general style for the wiki. As we feared that our own ideas might be too similar we thought of asking a broader public how they would design a website based on our logo. In order to do so, we headed to the ’Neckarwiese’. During summer, a big part of Heidelbergs population decideds to go there and enjoy the sun, have a BBQ or just relax – so we caught them off guard.

                                            We have had prepared a little presentatio with which we introduced them to iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Afterwards we explained them what we planned on doing, showed them our logo and asked, how they would design a website, based on what they’ve just heard. The general consens was to go for a blue theme, maybe add a little algae green  and generally stick to maritime iconography. Unexpectedly we actually met someone who knew his stuff: Natalie, a student of the history of arts from Berlin. She gave us useful advice on how play with the different colors, what to avoid and even added a little touch of history to it. Lucky catch!

Synthetic biology - engineering life with its most fundamental units by using DNA BioBricks and other modularly combinable parts, has a potential beyond scope and can improve the quality of life for everyone and mankind as a whole. The ultimate goal of researchers in synthetic biology is not only the understanding of life itself and how it functions, but applying the acquired knowledge to make a change within their community.
                                </P><P class="basictext">
To investigate the current state of the research and its acceptance in society, we talked to scientists and asked them how their work has <B>influenced their community</B>. Nonetheless, it is of absolute necessity to include the entire society. We decided to do this by organizing a panel discussion evening dedicated to the topic <B>'Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?'</B>, i.e. synthetic biology in medicine.
                                </P><P class="basictext">
As research in general and especially synthetic biology relies on a <B>community</B>, on <B>interaction</B> between researchers and the <B>exchange of ideas and expertise</B>, we asked experts and researchers from different fields to join us for this evening and we distributed flyers and placards to invite the broad society. However, we wanted to go a step further: The panel discussion was not limited to the audience in Heidelberg, it was <B>simultaneously</B><B>translated</B> from German to English and broadcasted it via a <B>live stream</B>.
                                </P><P class="basictext">
Despite the great enhancements synthetic biology can achieve, engineering with building blocks that are so close to the basic principles of life itself comes with a range of ethical questions and security precautions to consider. We see it as our immanent responsibility as iGEM team to address these questions and to take concerns very seriously. Hence, we invited <B>Prof. Dr. Axel Bauer</B>, who has been member of the German ethics council for several years and <B>Dr. Joachim Boldt</B> who works as assessor for the German ethics commitee for ethical implications of synthetic biology. Both of them are highly involved in the field of medical ethics also due to being professor for this subject. In order to review the safety concerns, we were very glad to have <B>Dr. Harald König</B>, who works at the Institute for Technology Assessment and System Analysis, as our guest.

                Different experts were invited to an interdisciplinary talk evening
            </STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="basictext">
Politics and law play a very big role when discussing the application of synthetic biology in real life. Researchers need to obey the juridical boundaries and on the contrary the legislature has to react to novel developments and find a compromise between many different opinions, some being more conservative, others more progressive. To reflect this interweaving, we additionally invited local politicians, such as <B>Prof. Dr. Nicole Marmé</B> who is member of the city council of Heidelberg. <B>Dr. Stephan Brandt</B>, chairman of the department for Biotechnological Innovation, Nanotechnology and Genetic Engineering, investigates how laws need to be adapted to the most recent findings in synthetic biology and genetics and we are very glad he joined us for this evening. Finally, the  topic that stands in the center of this evening is, after all, research in synthetic biology. For that reason, we asked <B>Dr. Dirk Grimm</B>, who works on the CRISPR-Cas system and who knows the cutting edge developments to be the scientific representative in the panel.

After a lot of planning, organization and set up of all the required technical equipment (thanks again to Dr. Jens Wagner from the Physics Department), the discussion evening could start with a brief introduction to the topic given by Jasmin and Max from our team. As we wanted the main part of the evening to be an open discussion, we deliberately made the introduction very compact. For the remaining 1.5 hours of the evening, Tim navigated our guests, as well as the audience through the discussion.
                                </P><P class="basictext">
The involvement of the audience was amazing, proving that this topic is indeed highly interesting to a large part of the society. Most eminently, we were very happy that additional to the approximately 100 guests that joined us physically in our institute, we had almost 400 viewers online, among them also <B>other iGEM teams</B>, such as iGEM Team Cambrige (link). Besides watching, our followers on twitter were also very engaged in <B>asking</B> questions that were then addressed by Tim and the invited experts.

                Luckily, many people came to our talk evening. Even more joined us online <I>via</I> our simultaneously translated live stream and asked questions with #askigemheidelberg
            </STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="basictext">
The topics discussed ranged from green to red <B>biotechnology</B> and were contemplated in a highly interdisciplinary way (with the focus on medical applications nonetheless). Besides, and in correspondence to the initialization of the “Community lab” track in iGEM, we addressed <B>biohacking</B> and the implications of it on society, the scientific community and the communication between the two entities. Question were asked about ethical problems and implications of in vivo and in vitro technologies, but also about  <B>dreams and wishes</B> of the scientists regarding future developments in this field. The question iGEM team Cambridge nicely summarizes the last part of the discussion: <B> “How can synthetic biologists better communicate their research to the public?” </B> This includes the role of politicians and law makers, as well as the responsibility of everyone who is involved in research to put a focus on the outreach and the interaction, not only with the scientific community, but also with the broader public.
                                </P><P class="basictext">
So far, many iGEM teams have organized discussion evenings and invited people from the broad society to join an interdisciplinary evening. This approach is great and helps a lot to improve the communication between scientists and the public. Nonetheless, there are still barriers to overcome: 
<UL class="basictext"><LI> The interested population of one city is not representing the entire society. Hence, we decided to provide the opportunity to join us online via live stream. This should not be limited to watching the discussion passively, that is why everyone could ask questions via twitter by #askigemheidelberg. These questions were then shown in the discussion, so that our invited guests could reply or reflect on them. </LI><LI> The lingua franca in research is English, however not everybody is capable of speaking English fluently. Therefore, we deliberately chose German as the language the discussion was held in. This way, everyone who was interested had the possibility to follow. In order to keep the event international and also understandable for those who watched online, we translated the event simultaneously to English. </LI></UL></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="content"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="basicheader">week number 38</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-12"><DIV class="notebookentry"><H3 class="notebookheading">▼2015-09-14  Test bitte löschen</H3><DIV class="notebooktext"><P>10 x &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;

                                            The use of restriction enzymes is no option for cloning if functional nucleic acids contain the recognition sites for enzymes used in standard restriction cloning, as described in RFC 10, or other suitable restriction enzymes. Although techniques using Type IIs restriction enzymes like Golden Gate assembly do not leave scars after cloning, a Type IIs recognition site within the functional RNA sequence may greatly reduce the efficiency and fidelity of a Golden Gate based cloning attempt. 
                                            Therefore, the method of choice for reliable assembly of the sequences into a standardized vector has to be based on homology at the interfaces of the parts to be fused. As the DNA templates for functional RNA are commonly synthesized de novo, the addition of overhangs upstream and downstream the functional sequence does not appear to be challenging. Equally those extensions can be added during PCR with primer overhangs.

                                            A highly energetic azide reacts with an alkyne enabling a selective reaction that links these reactive groups to one another via a dipolar cycloaddition (Fig. 1). However this reaction requires a lot of activation energy.<X-REF>Zhang2005</X-REF> Without catalyst the reaction is slow and results in a 1,4, 1,5 triazole regioisomer. To increase the reaction rate and to avoid this byproduct it is necessary to add copper as a catalyst. Copper (Cu(I)) proofed to be a suitable catalyst that rapidly yields a 1,2,3 triazole heterocycle.

Small molecules are known to regulate many cellular functions. Hence, the development of innovative techniques to analyze metabolic pathways became an important field in research. Those assays require a variety of tools allowing the user to detect small molecules even within live cells<X-REF>Fernandez-Suarez2008</X-REF><X-REF>Tyagi2009</X-REF>. Such methods hold promise to solve the mechanisms of transcription, translation, localization and the function of non-coding RNA. 
The most common ways to analyze small molecules or cellular pathways include protein-based methods like GFP or molecule reactive probes which have been engineered in the past. Having a fluorescent readout seems to be a valuable implement to provide time-resolved information <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>. Recently, Paige et al. discovered an RNA that mimics the green fluorescent protein (GFP) so called “Spinach” <X-REF>Paige2011</X-REF><X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF><X-REF>Strack2015</X-REF>. This Spinach aptamer was generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). In presence of the 3’5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidne imidazolinone dye (DFHBI), RNA forms a stable Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex, which is fluorescent. Since then Spinach has been successfully applied by several laboratories to image RNA in live cells<X-REF>Buxbaum2015</X-REF><X-REF>Dean2014</X-REF>. Moreover, this RNA has been used as a tool to monitor RNA synthesis in real-time<X-REF>Höfer2013</X-REF><X-REF>Pothoulakis</X-REF><I>in vitro</I> or to sense different small molecule levels <I>in vivo</I><X-REF>Kellenberger2015</X-REF><X-REF>Kellenberger2013</X-REF>. A prominent example is the sensing of ci-di-GMP concentrations in live cells. To do so, Kellenberger <I>et al.</I> attached a ci-di-GMP aptamer to the Spinach aptamer. In presence of a small molecule (c-di-GMP) the aptamer forms a functional stem which results in the formation of a fluorescent Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex. Thus, small molecule concentrations can be determined by a fluorescence read-out system.

In our project we are interested in small molecules that are difficult to sense using common techniques. Here we will describe an innovative system that uses the Spinach2 fused to a specific aptamer to detect small molecules. In 2013 the Jaffrey Lab developed Spinach2 which shows in comparison to Spinach a better folding efficiency and thermostability. <X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF>. To generate aptamers that specifically bind to a small molecule, we will use our software <B>JAWS</B>. Using this set up we will be able to show that our software is capable to support time consuming methods like SELEX, to identify Aptamers that bind specifically to small molecules. As an interesting target, we will sense the small molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in biochemical reactions. A common method that is performed in thousands of laboratories is a <I>in vitro</I> transcriptions To study the function of ribonucleic acids, RNA is generally prepared by <I>in vitro</I> transcription<X-REF>Beckert2011</X-REF>. Using bacteriophage DNA dependent RNA polymerases (T7, T3, Sp6), a variety of different RNAs can be enzymatically synthesized in the lab. In this context we want to establish a new biochemical readout method, called <B>real-time SMS</B>, to record simultaneously small molecules (ATP) and enzymatic kinetics (RNA polymerase) using Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system.

Common techniques to sense small molecules in biochemical reactions are most likely connected to radioactive labeling. The exposure to radioactive sources is known to result in damage of the genetic information and is therefore more and more banished from lab work. However because of its sensitivity, radioactive chemicals are needed to monitor small changes of those molecules. 
</P><P class="basictext">
A common method that is performed in many laboratories is an <I>in vitro</I> transcription (Fig. 1A). This method is usually performed in a black-box manner. To analyze the decrease of nucleotide trisphosphate over time as well as to determine the success of the <I>in vitro</I> transcription, scientists use radioactive labelled nucleotide triphosphates and perform time demanding acrylamide gel electrophoresis.

To establish such tool box, two different fluorescent RNA constructs will be applied: The first construct is a fusion of an ATP aptamer<X-REF>Sassanfar1993</X-REF> and Spinach2<X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF> (Fig. 1B), which we will call <B>Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system </B>. To improve the binding of the ATP aptamer to ATP we apply our own implemented JAWS software. Using our software, nucleotides which form the stem region of the ATP aptamer can be predicted, which will improve binding properties of this RNA to ATP. The fusion of this aptamer to the Spinach2 enables us a fluorescent read out in real-time. Thus, in presence of this small molecule, the ATP aptamer will form a tight stem loop, which results in a new structural conformation of the Spinach aptamer. Finally after binding of the ATP, the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer is able to interact with the DFHBI. Hereby fluorescence can be measured at 500 nm if the Spinach was excited at 460 nm. We will generate using our <B>JAWS software</B> different Spinach2-ATP-Aptamers. To validate the software as well as to identify the best Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system, we will analyze them concerning their fluorescent turn-on effect in presence of ATP.

                General overview of our real time SMS tool-box, which allows the monitoring of the ATP consumption during <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction. For this purpose we designed a DNA template containing a promoter (T7) according to the applied RNA polymerase, RNA of interest (ROI), Hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) and Malachite Green Aptamer (MGA). If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox is a fusion of Spinach2 to an ATP-binding Aptamer, predicted by our JAWS software. In presence of ATP, the ATP Aptamer forms a stem, enabling the DFHBI dye to bind to the Spinach Aptamer thereby triggering fluorescence emission.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="basictext">
The second important part of the toolbox is a DNA template containing a promoter according to the applied RNA polymerase and a <B>Malachite Green Aptamer</B> (Fig. 1C), which is excited at 630 nm and emits at 652 nm in presents of malachite green dye. If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox allows a direct analysis of the success of the <I>in vitro</I> transcription in real-time. In an advanced set up, this system can be extended by DNA template encoding for the RNA of interest (ROI) and a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Both fragments are inserted between the promotor and the Malachite Green Aptamer. Inducing the hammerhead ribozyme allows cleavage during the <I>in vitro</I> transcription. Hereby two RNA fragments emerge, the ROI and the hammerhead ribozyme fused to Malachite Green Aptamer (HHR-MGA). Using such setup, the emitted fluorescence of the HHR-MGA will be independent on the applied ROI. Thus the fluorescence induced by the Malachite Green Aptamer can be applied to compare efficiencies of different RNAs at the same time.

The combination of two aptamers that are able to turn on fluorescence by binding to DFHBI or malachite green provide us the possibility to monitor simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis during <I>in vitro</I> transcription in real-time (Fig. 2).

All of them are based on an ATP Aptamer described by Szostak. ATP Aptamer Spinach2 is the original aptamer that was generated by Szostak. ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 contain the core sequence of the original ATP Aptamer, but have a modified stem, generated by our software JAWS. In presence of the ATP ligand, the ATP aptamer should change its tertiary structure and forms together with the Spinach2 a stem. The stem formations should finally result in an increase of the fluorescence. Using this read-out system we can compare the JAWS-generated Aptamers with the original one, described by Szostak. If our JAWS software works nicely, we should get a better fluorescent read-out with ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 or ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 in comparison to the original ATP Aptamer Spinach2 construct.

Analyzing biochemical reactions depend on radioactive labeling. Yet, many laboratories try to avoid the usage of radioactivity since it is connected to affect the health.

Common techniques like TLC have a very poor limit of detection. Especially in our studies, a highly sensitive method is needed to visualize ATP concentration in biochemical reactions. Thus, we can apply our ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 system so sense consumption of ATP in real time (Fig. 6). To show the general feasibility of our system we titrated the T7 RNA polymerase concentration in <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction. We monitored the fluorescence signal of the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 in regular intervals. In presence of a high RNA polymerase concentration we would expect the highest turn-off effect of the fluorescence. In Figure 6B we show the results of the real time measurements of the spinach fluorescence. As expected we can show that the ATP signal decreases rapidly in presence of a high concentration of polymerase. In contrast, if less RNA polymerase was applied, the measured fluorescence is much higher. To confirm the results of the fluorescence measurements, we analyzed the <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction using denaturing acrylamide gels in addition (Fig. 6C).

The graph of the functional aptamer with malachite green and T7 polymerase shows an increase of fluorescence over time. We were able to record a classical enzyme kinetic curve of a polymerase using the malachite green system (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, to confirm our data and to show, that the transcription efficiency is not hampered by the malachite green dye, we performed denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7C).

To show the general applicability of our Spinach/Malachite green system to optimize transcription conditions in the shortest time possible, we tested different buffers systems first (Fig. 10). Especially buffers are known to have a huge influence on the activity of the polymerase which can probably improve the transcription of the DNA template “substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme”. 
</P><P class="basictext">
For the buffer screen we applied six different buffer systems: Three transcription buffers pH 8.1 with different spermidine concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 10 mM, Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.1, HEPES buffer pH 7.5 (similar to the renaturing buffer) and a buffer including BSA pH 8.1. All buffers were analyzed using the same conditions as described in previous assays. As DNA template we applied the Malachite Green Aptamer with T7 promotor. Using our fluorescent read out system we can determine different transcription efficiencies. In presence of the HEPES buffer no increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence signal was monitored (Fig. 10A).

The transcription buffer (1 mM and 10 mM) shows the highest slope of Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence and the fastest decrease of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 fluorescence (Fig. 10C).

To overcome the dependence of the setup to apply a specific polymerase we designed new transcription templates containing different promoters for a subset of commercial available RNA polymerase such as T7 Phi 2.5, T3, Sp6 and E. coli (T7A1) (Fig. 12A). All polymerases have been tested for 12 hours at 37 °C and were measured in regular time intervals using TECAN Safire. The results show that the decrease of ATP AptamerJWAS1 Spinach2 activity is connected to the speed of the RNA polymerase. The data indicates that the reduction of ATP goes faster for T7 and T7Phi 2.5 than for the other candidates (Fig. 12B). Therefore the fluorescence of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 decreases. The T3 polymerase is a little bit slower than the T7 RNA polymerase and does not reach the same bottom point. Nevertheless the graph decreases still over time and the polymerase seem to be active even after 500 min of the reaction. The Sp6 shows activity as well. The Sp6 leads to higher Malachite Green Aptamer production by using less ATP or leading to more functional RNA, while the T3 has a lower ATP Aptamer Spinach2 activity than Malachite Green Aptamer.

To sense specifically small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years. </P><P class="basictext">
In this project we developed an innovative method that can be applied as a tool box, enabling us to sense small molecules in real-time (real-time SMS) using a fluorescent readout at two different emission wavelengths. Using a spinach aptamer fused to an ATP aptamer we can sense ATP concentrations in real-time during a biochemical reaction. Thus we were able to analyze classical <I>in vitro</I> transcriptions in detail by monitoring simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis. 
</P><P class="basictext">
A <B>major achievement</B> of our fluorescent tool-box was the validation of our own implemented JAWS software. ATP Aptamer-stems were successfully predicted which were causing a high turn-on effect of the fluorescence in presence of the small molecule. The ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA shows a stronger interaction with ATP resulting in a higher fluorescence maximum than the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach RNA. However, the tight binding to the small molecule ATP can result in a decreased bioavailability of this NTP for the polymerase. This results in decreased transcription efficiency. Due to this effect we decided to apply the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach for our fluorescent read-out system. Nevertheless live-cell imaging might benefit from the good binding properties of ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA. Imaging of ATP in cells might be also an interesting target to study.
</P><P class="basictext">
Another important achievement was the monitoring of the change of ATP concentrations during the <I>in vitro</I> transcription. We can show that the concentration of used amount of polymerase changes the final RNA yield. We increased the polymerase concentration and observed low Spinach and high malachite green fluorescence levels. Thus ATP was consumed and RNA was successfully transcribed. In addition we were able to show the influence of different buffer systems, inhibitors and different polymerase. Using this huge amount of generated Data, we were able to model in vitro transcription reactions and to analyze the speed of nucleotide incorporation. By application of our tool-box, a <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction can be optimized within a few hours. Thus difficult transcription targets can be easily optimized. 
</P><P class="basictext">
Furthermore, we were able to set-up a method to quantify the RNA yields in real-time. Similar to classical colorimetric assays like Bradford, we successfully applied instead of BSA, our Malachite Green Aptamer RNA to generate a calibration curve with a really good correlation coefficient.
In addition, the JAWS generated ATP aptamer Spinach can be applied in several other biochemical reactions that depend on ATP. In interesting target would be the Poly(A) polymerase<X-REF>Balbo2007</X-REF>, that attaches several adenosine moieties to the 3’-end of RNAs in eukaryotes.
</P><P class="basictext">
Furthermore, by using the JAWS software we can generate new sensors that are specifically binding to new interesting small molecules for example rape drugs, cofactors like NAD(H) or FAD. The generated aptamers could be fused to the Spinach and binding can be monitored by an increase of the fluorescence in presence of the small molecule.
</P><P class="basictext">
Those generated aptamers might by also applicable for live-cell imaging to sense small molecules. We have already demonstrated for ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA a good binding efficiency, which might be a good candidate for imaging experiments as well.

To bypass the problem of having to ask people per mail and not in person, we had the idea to interview speakers that visited a conference here in Heidelberg. We were surprised to see how well they could explain concepts related to synthetic biology!! Yet, to be honest, the conference was on <I>systems biology</I>, a field very close to synthetic biology, so it is perhaps not too surprising that they showed such high competence in this topic.

Beyond the systems biologists, we actually received written answers to our questions (Table 1) from the director general of the EMBL, Dr. Ian Mattaj. He showed quite some knowledge of what synthetic biology is, and gave us some interesting points of views, such as the feeling that synthetic biology applications are already pervasive in our daily life (we would not have expected this statement!). Here you find all his replies:
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: Do you know what synthetic biology is? 
A: Yes
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: How does synthetic biology impact society in your opinion? 
A: Synthetic Biology will lead to the way that many types of “manufacturing” are done, in the widest sense of the word. This has both the potential for good, for example in easing shortages or developing processes that produce fewer pollutants or unwanted side-effects, but will also change how some people work.
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: Throughout the years did your opinion on synthetic biology change?  
A: No
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: Did you hear of great accomplishments in the field that you thought would never be possible? 
A: Thus far not. There was always a very large potential and so nothing I have seen has gone beyond the obviously possible so far.
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: What is the biggest risk associated to synthetic biology? 
A: I would say a lack of acceptance in society caused by a lack of information that is broadly accessible to enable members of the public to assess risk (cf GMO debate).
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: How far is a future where synthetic biology applications are part of everyday life? 
A: It is here now.
</P><P class="basictext">
Q: Would you support students to undertake studies in synthetic biology? 
A: Yes, there have been PhD students in EMBL already who have carried out projects that would be defined as synthetic biology.

In performing this video project, we learnt a lot about how to approach famous and busy scientists, how they reason and how they feel about synthetic biology. In listening to their inspiring words, we got even more enthusiastic about synthetic biology and feel compelled to positively impact society in the future with our innovative ideas. It would have been fantastic to be able to collect more information on the opinion of scientists totally outside of the field, but this was somehow not possible. While the answers we got from Ian Mattaj clearly show that scientists working in unrelated field can have an opinion on synthetic biology, we should consider that the EMBL is a research institute where synthetic biology has been present. We fear that most scientists working in institutes where synthetic biology projects were never performed would not be able to define synthetic biology or would fail to see the difference between synthetic biology and biotechnology (well, we saw how for instance even some of the system biologists we interviewed still spoke of synthetic biology as biotechnology, so this distinction seems to be fuzzy even for those working in closely related field!). Synthetic biologists have still to go a long way to explain their approaches and goals to other researchers and to the lay public. We think that the iGEM foundation, by pushing teams to perform human practice projects during the iGEM competition, strongly accelerates the spread of knowledge on this fascinating new field of research and pushes us students to spend time reflecting on how important it is to explain what we do to the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/hp/discussion">outside world</A>.
