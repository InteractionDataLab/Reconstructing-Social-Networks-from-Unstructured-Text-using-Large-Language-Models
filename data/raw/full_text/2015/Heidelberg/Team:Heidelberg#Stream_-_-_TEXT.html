Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?
We, the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2015 hereby invite you to our discussion regarding the topic, if and how synthetic biology should influence modern health and life in general.
We have made it our goal to inform society about the possibilities that synthetic biology has to offer for modern medicine. In order to give a stage for the questions this might raise, we organised a discussion about the topic 'Synthetic biology - Bricks for a healthy life?' (german: 'Synthetische Biologie - Bausteine für ein gesundes Leben?'). We invited multiple representatives of different fields of todays society to discuss about that. Amongst them are doctors, politicians, scientists, philosophers ... and YOU! .
In windows below you can on the one hand watch a life stream of our discussion - translated into english in realtime and contribute to our discussion by asking questions via Twitter. In order to do so, you just need to tweet your questions with the hashtag '#askigemheidelberg' and they will show up for us. As members of the team will be moderating the evening, we'll try to forward your questions to our speakers, so you can have them answered. In case we won't be able to answer your questions live, we'll answer them later on via text.
Life Stream of the Discussion
For the wiki freeze we had to remove the player for the stream as it was using Flash and our Twitter life feed as it loads data from an external source.
