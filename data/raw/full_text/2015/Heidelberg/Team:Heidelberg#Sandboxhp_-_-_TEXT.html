Super awesome teaser!
What is all this about?
The idea is that first we and then all the iGEM Teams that want to get involved, collect question videos from the general public with local issues. Afterwards the video is sent to another iGEM-Team which will reply to the video with a short answer on how this issue could be solved through synthetic biology.
So, how does our idea work?
For your video you can show off your creativity. It can be complex or really simple like a power point. At the beginning you can show us how you catch our question that we “put in a falcon” by simply taking one and throwing it into the picture while filming. It is important that you explain the question within 3 min. It would be great if you made an HD-video in 16:9 and send it to us if possible by August 17th. If you have the time, please try to raise questions from the community as soon as possible so that you can pass it on to another iGEM-Team. In case English is not your national language you might record the video in your native language and hand in a translation as well. I would like to ask you to add the time when the subtitle should appear, too. I could look like this: “0,4s I would be excited | 0,6s if you can store fruits without getting moldy.|9s”
Then go to your communities and ask people what synthetic biology can do for them (Hint: different country, different laws: insure that you are not filming people that are not willing to be filmed.                                             Upload the question video and send this mail to another iGEM- Do not worry if cannot find your video in the dropbox folder several days after you have uploaded it we have download them and delete them from the online folder so that we will not run out of storage.
Love,
iGEM Heidelberg
Workflow
Receive a question from an iGEM-Team
Answer the problem and make a video of your plans
Go to your community and detect local problems
Send the video of your solution and the problems that people have in your community back to us
Pass on the question to another iGEM-Team that will do just the same as you did.
Guidelines
Your video (interview of your community and your solution) should not be longer than 3 minutes
Format: 16:9, horizontal, HD
The entire video must be in English
Please make sure that you are not breaking any local laws and make sure that you are allowed to film these people (please ensure that these people are old enough)
Upload the video to our dropbox or mail it to us
