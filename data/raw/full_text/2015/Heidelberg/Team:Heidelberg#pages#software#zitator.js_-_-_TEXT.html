zitator.js - Awesome citation and bibliography generator
As every good engineer, we hate repititon and love automation. So we didn't bother with formatting and managing our references by hand and wrote a litte helper that would take care of that - like it is standard outside of the web.
As everyone already has it's own database of references tucked away in a bibtex file, EndNote or similar programm, we decided not to reinvent the wheel and instead make it easy for you to import this database.
So how can you use this awesome piece of software? Simple: Upload your .bib file to to the iGEM wiki - note that EndNote can export it's library in BibTeX format and that you may have to change the file ending to .txt before uploading to the iGEM wiki -, second add the following code at the beginning of your page:
{{Heidelberg/js/zitator.js}}
and in the JavaScript Section:
$(function() {     // The parameter are the selector for the container(s) of text in which you want replacement     // and a URL pointing to your bibfile - mind the same origin policy...     zitator = new Zitator(".basicText", "https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2015/b/ba/Heidelberg_refdb.txt");     zitator.zitiere(); });
as well as the placeholder for the bibliography
<div id="references"></div>
and third, start citing!
<div class="basicText"> <!-- Some paragraphs ?> <p> Zitator is the awesomest web zitation software available to iGEMers right now <x-ref>igemHD2015</x-ref>! </p> </div>
where "igemHD2015" would be the BibTeX citationKey of your reference.
