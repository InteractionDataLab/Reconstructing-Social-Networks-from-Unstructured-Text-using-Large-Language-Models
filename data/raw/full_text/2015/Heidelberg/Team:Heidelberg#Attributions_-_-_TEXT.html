Thank you!
Here we want to thank everyone who supported us this year and thus helped us make our project come true. Numerous individuals, research groups, departments and companies supported us throughout the entire project and here we want to say thank you for this!
A special thanks goes to Prof. Dr. Roland Eils, Dr. Irina Lehmann and Dr. Barbara Di Ventura who instructed our team and to Lukas Brenner, Katharina Höfer, Stefan Kallenberger, Ilia Kats and Philipp Walch who mentored us this year as advisors.
All lab work including primer and construct design, PCRs, minipreps, making cells competent, cryo-stocking, cloning, tranforming, pouring and running of gels, nanodropping, fluorescence measurements, preparation of samples, blotting, all the funny stuff etc. was performed by members of the iGEM Team Heidelberg only.
More precisely, Jasmin, Michael and Daniel worked on the establishment of AptaBodies for Western blotting. The application for Southern blotting was added by Frieda. The system for the detection of small molecules was developed by Christine and Frieda. The live-tracking of the in vitro transcription was done by Max. The two softwares that were used in most subprojects were developed by Michael. Stefan worked on the verification of the software and the detection of molecules in high-throughput. The modeling for this and the life-tracking was performed by Stefan. Daniel, Hendrik, Tim and Michael worked on the twin ribozyme assay to repair the defekt CFTR-RNA. The cell culture setup was worked on by Stefan and Daniel.  Jasmin and Stefan designed the setup for the pulse-chase assay. Jasmin, Christine, Max and Tim organized the panel discussion. Tim and Lukas H. implemented the wiki. The progress of all projects has been discussed with the entire team and all instructors and advisors regularly.
Great thanks to the entire staff of the BioQuant for making our daily lab life a lot easier! We would also like to thank Jan Flessau for helping us with the animated videos, Silvan Schmitz for helping us with our design and Moritz Przybilla for cheering us up and for helpful discussions, Lara Schlegel for her cute drawings, Yassin Harim for quick and professional photography, Florian Schmidt for problem solving discussions and Konrad Herbst for his advice concerning cloning strategies. Oh, and of course stackoverflow.
We would like to thank all our supporters for explaining new techniques to us and for providing experience with the whole iGEM procedure. Thank you for believing in us, for asking the right questions and for encouraging us during the more difficult times.
In special, we want to thank AG Bishofs and AG Rippe for letting us use their GelDoc. Furthermore we want to thank Dr. Grimm and Julia Fakhiri for providing us with plasmids and advising us. We are thank AG Herten for providing the speedvac for our purposes and to Jürgen Beneke and Nina Beil for assistance in setting up the robot for us. Thanks a lot to Prof. Andres Jäschke, Gabriele Nübel, and Dr. Murat Sünbül for helping us during the initial planning, for their advice on aptamers and RNA work and for letting us use their equipement. We also want to express our gratitude towards Jens Wagner for providing us with equipment for the live streaming of our panel disscusion. Thanks to Matthias Bieg, Dr. Nagarajan Paramasivam, and Dr. Zuguang Gu for helping us to evaluate the next-gereration-sequencing data. AG Langowski helped us out with a Typhoon scanner, thanks for that. We are grateful for the allocation of the MALDI-TOF MS and the instruction by Wiebke Nadler. We want to say thank you to Dr. Damjana Kastelic for helping during initial planning and for giving us advice whenever we asked for it. Dr. Vladimir Benes helped us very much by putting the next-generation-sequencing on rush. During our software development we used JUG, thanks to Dr. Luis Pedro Coelho for elucidations and his help. Furthermore, we thank Dr. Suat Özbek for lending us the nanodrop for the summer and Navneethan Palanisamy for shooting  videos for us in India and Emer Hickey for shooting videos in Ireland for our video project.  In addition, we want to thank Darko Balke for advising us in Twin Ribozyme issues. We thank Prof. Marcus A. Mall for defining the disease of cystic fibrosis such as related subjects, for good scientific advice and for encouragement to bring our constructs into his specialized cell line. Especially we want to thank Dr. Julia Dürr, Johanna Salomo, and Heike Scheuermann who offered us their help with this cell line. Besides, a big thank you to two goups who provided us with purified proteins: Dr. Tamás Haraszti for purified actin and the group of Dr. Barbara Di Ventura for purified MinD-Δ10-His, MinE-His, Xylanase, Endoylsin-His, YEKJ-His and p53-His.
