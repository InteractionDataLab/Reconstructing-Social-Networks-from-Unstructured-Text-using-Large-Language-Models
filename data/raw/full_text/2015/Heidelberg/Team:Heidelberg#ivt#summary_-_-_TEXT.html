Summary
The specific monitoring of small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years. In this project we developed small molecule sensor (SMS) enabling us to analyze biochemical reactions in real-time using a fluorescent readout. Our implemented JAWS software generates us the best ATP-binding Aptamer which is fused to the Spinach Aptamer. In presence of ATP fluorescence will be emitted. This tool enables the sensing of small molecules like ATP that are part of biochemical reactions.
Major Achievements:
Validation of the JAWS Software
Sensing of ATP concentrations in biochemical reactions
Establishment of a dual-fluorescent read-out system to sense small molecules in real-time
Detailed monitoring of the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis
