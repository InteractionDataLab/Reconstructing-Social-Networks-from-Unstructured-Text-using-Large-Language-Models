▼2015-08-25  RE-cloning: Digest of pSB1C3 containing RFP and Insert for RFC preparation
2 µg ofpSB1C3 and RFC preparation insert were incubated with EcoRI and SpeI 1 h at 37 °C with subsequent heat inactivation at 80 °C for 10 min.

Digest was checked on 1% agarose in TAE gel and visualized with EtBr under UV light.
Insert was purified using Qiagen PCR purification Kit; pSB1C3 backbone was excised from 0,8 % agarose gel and purified using gele extraction kit from Qiagen.
▼2015-08-25  Primer extension for RFC insert plus RFC-Spinach
Oligos xxfs022xx and xxfs038xx (Spinach-Insert for RFC preparation) and xxfs046xx and xxfs047xx (Spinach for RFC) were annealed and extended using Phusion Flash:

5 mL LB plus CM were inoculated with colony 1 to 6 an grown at 37 °C
PCR products of colonies 1 to 6 are checked on 1 % agarose gel and visualized with EtBr under UV light
Results & Outlook:
Colonies 1 and 2 are positive according to fragment of colony PCR on agarose gel.
Cryo stocks will be prepared and Plamid will be prepped and test digested.
▼2015-08-30  Cryostock and Miniprep of RFC
Cryostock:
500 µL of oN culture and 500 µL of autoclaved 40 % glycerol solution were mixed. Stock was stored at -80 °C.
Miniprep:
Plasmid was purified using QIAprep Miniprep kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.
An aliquot was sent to GATC for sequencing using xxmj006xx and xxmj07xx.
Sequence was confirmed.
