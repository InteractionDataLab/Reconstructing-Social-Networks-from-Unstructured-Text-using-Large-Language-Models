PLATINUM Sponsoring
Klaus Tschira Stiftung
In 1995, Klaus Tschira, physicist and co-founder of the software company SAP, founded the Klaus Tschira Stiftung (KTS). With the intention to place strong emphasis on natural sciences in the society, the commitment of the KTS ranges from kindergarten to schools, universities and research institutions all over Germany. The support is differentiated in three main fields: natural sciences for children and young people, research and science communication. The foundation is located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelberg, the former residence of Nobel Prize laureate for chemistry Carl Bosch.
Dietmar Hopp Stiftung
Dietmar Hopp founded his foundation in 1995 to enable the implementation of charitable projects. His foundation encourages projects in the area sports, medicine, social support and education. Thus the Hopp foundation supports medical research projects on the highest level including cancer research and pediatrics. In the area of education the foundation facilitates institutions and projects for young people- from kindergarten to university. The Hopp foundation also supports our project and our team of young scientists!
Cell Networks
CellNetworks is an interdisciplinary research cluster centered around Heidelberg´s life sciences. The Heidelberg life science community features an unparalleled number of internationally well-noted institutions. Since 2006 CellNetworks is part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. CellNetworks assembles excellent groups focusing on research in molecular life science and computational sciences, chemistry and physics to tackle fundamental questions in cell biology, its network structure and architecture, dynamics and regulation.
GOLD Sponsoring
Genious
Geneious is a DNA, RNA and protein sequence alignment, assembly and analysis software platform, integrating bioinformatic and molecular biology tools into a simple interface. Geneious provides us their software which helped us design primers and plan our cloning.
Hamilton
Hamilton is a company design and manufacture of liquid handling, process analytics, robotics and automated storage solutions. For more than 60 years, Hamilton has been meeting customer needs with a combination of quality materials and skilled workmanship that ensures the highest level of performance. Hamilton sponsored the consumables for our lab robot which we need for mass-cross-screening of our aptameres computed by the software against various ligand and Mg-concentrations.
Lange und Pflanz
Lange + Pflanz advertising agency Gmbh has been a specialist for Marketing and Design since 1992. Our focus covers the fields of financial , corporate and strategic communication. As an owner-operated communication company we offer individual and enduring communication solutions for variable media platforms.
IDT
Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. is the world's largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development. IDT sponsored gblocks which we need for gene construction and modification.
SILVER Sponsoring
Biorad
The company of BioRad Laboratories began to work on life science research applications. By now, devices, chemicals, as well as consumables and systems are supplied by BioRad for analytical, chemical, and life science purposes. BioRad provided us slides and precision plus dual color protein standard for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
BASF
BASF's broad portfolio ranges from chemicals, plastics, performance products and crop protection products to oil and gas. In 2014, BASF posted sales of €74.0 billion and income from operations before special items of approximately €7.6 billion. BASF tries to combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility. Through research and innovation, BASF claims to support their customers in nearly every industry in meeting the current and future needs of society.
Fryka
The FRYKA-Kältetechnik family company was founded in 1967 in Esslingen, Germany and has become one of the most sought-after experts on the subject of cooling and freezing of gases, liquids and solids in Germany. Fryka repaired our Fryka -80 °C Lab Freezer.
Chroma
Chroma Technology Corp. is a manufacturer of interference filters for the ultra-violet, visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum, including bandpass, multiple bandpass, and long and short pass filters, as well as beamsplitters, dichroic mirrors and laser rejection filters. We specialize in precision spectral control, including extra high signal-to-noise ratio filters and those with rapid cut-on and cut-off profiles. The manufacturing process involves precisely depositing, in a vacuum, extremely thin layers of two or more materials on a glass or similarly transparent substrate.
Jeno Bioscience
Jena Bioscience GmbH was founded in 1998 by a team of scientists from the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Physiology in Dortmund. Since the start up, the company has evolved into an global reagent supplier with about 8000 products in stock and a customer base in 80+ countries. Jena Bioscience serves three major client groups: Research laboratories at universities, industry, government, hospitals and medical schools as well as Pharmaceutical industry in the process from lead discovery through to pre-clinical stages and Laboratory & diagnostic reagent kit producers and re-sellers. Jena Bioscience’s products include nucleosides, nucleotides and their non-natural analogs, recombinant proteins & protein production systems, reagents for Click Chemistry, for crystallization of biological macromolecules and solutions for molecular biology and biochemistry. Jena Bioscience sponsored 3 alkine modified NTP.
ACADEMIC Sponsoring
University of Heidelberg
Heidelberg University, founded in 1386, is Germany’s oldest university and one of the strongest research institutions in Europe. The successes in both rounds of the Excellence Initiative and in international rankings prove its leading role in the scientific community. Heidelberg University is a comprehensive university with the full spectrum of subjects including medicine. It aims to strengthen the individual disciplines, to further interdisciplinary cooperation and to make research results usable for society and industry. Heidelberg also draws its strength from its cooperation with local non-university research institutions and is tied into a worldwide network of research and teaching collaborations.
German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)
The DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) is the largest biomedical research institute in Germany and a member of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers. In over 90 divisions and research groups, our more than 3,000 employees, of which more than 1,000 are scientists, are investigating the mechanisms of cancer, are identifying cancer risk factors and are trying to find strategies to prevent people from getting cancer .They are developing novel approaches to make tumor diagnosis more precise and treatment of cancer patients more successful.
IPMB (Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biology)
The Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biology in Heidelberg deals with the development, the investigation, and the use of drugs.  Different scientific fields have to be combined to apportion molecular mechanisms of action, side effects, and drug efficiency. We were using the Typhoon scanner, the gel imaging systems, and some fluorophores for initial testing that were provided by the IPMB.
Bioqant
The BioQuant, the Center for “Quantitative Analysis of Molecular and Cellular Biosystems” at Heidelberg University was established in 2007 as an interdisciplinary University research center that is solely dedicated to research and training in systems biology. BioQuants’s objective is to function as a platform for the development and constant refinement of mathematical models of complex biological systems as well as the swift validation of scientific hypotheses via experimental data. Currently, up to 40 University and non-University research groups (DKFZ, EMBL, the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS, formerly the European Media Lab), and the MPI for Medical Research) are affiliated with BioQuant. These research groups are instrumental in implementing numerous national and international systems biology funding initiatives.
Center of Organsimal Studies
The Centre for Organismal Studies (COS) Heidelberg aims to study organismic biology beyond the borders of organisational level. Research and teaching at COS is dedicated to study organismic biology from the basic molecular principles to cell biology, developmental biology and physiology both in plants and in animals and to further extend into evolution, biodiversity, systems biology and biotechnology.
