- w/o T7 RNA Polymerase
+ with T7 RNA Polymerase
Fluorescence was measured in the Tecan Safire 2 for 12 hours
Conditions: Conditions are listed in assay 25
Results: The data shows that the T7 and T7 2.5 are the fastest RNA polymerase according to their ATP consumption and the increasing signal of Malachite Green Aptamer in the Assay. The T3 RNA Polymerase is slower than both T7 RNA Polymerase, but it is still active after 500 min. The Sp6 has a higher Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence while having a small ATP consumption in comparison to the T3 RNA polymerase. The E. coli RNA polymerase shows no activity.

The readout was performed in the Tecan Safire 2
Conditions: Measurement conditions are listed in assay 25
Results: With the decrease of enzyme concentration we can see that the fluorescence of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 decreases slower than under higher concentrated RNA Polymerase concentration. Hence, the increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer is slower, too. The 1:10 thinner shows no increase of Malachite Green Aptamer Fluorescence and slight decrease of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 fluorescence.
▼2015-09-08  33. Comparison of the Spectra of all ATP Aptamer Spinach2 Variations
Aim: Demonstration of the enhancement of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 made by the software JAWS by exchanging the stem
Procedure:
RNA was renatured in 1x Renaturing buffer
The setup is listed in assay protocol 13
Conditions: The Spectra were measured in the JASCO. Conditions are shown in experiment 14
Results: The results show that the computer enhanced ATP Aptamer Spinach2 has a higher fluorescence than the Szostak ATP Aptamer that we added to the Spinach2. By comparing the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 to the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 we can see that the  ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 has a higher peak than the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2.

Conditions: The assay was performed in the Tecan Safire 2 under the conditions describes in protocol 25.
Results: The data shows that the transcription buffers generate the biggest yield and the highest ATP consumption. The Tris HCl buffer and the BSA buffer also show an increase of Malachite Green Aptamer and a decrease of the fluorescence of the ATP Spinach2. But both signals are less steep than the changes of signal in the transcription buffers. The HEPES buffer shows no signal. Hence, we expect no transcribed RNA.

Fluorescence was measured in the spectro fluorometer JASCO
Conditions:
Excitation: 460 nm
Emission spectra: 500 nm
Measurement Mode: Time course
Sensitivity: High
Temperature: 37 °C
Results: First, the Blanks are not changing significantly over time. Further results indicate a decrease of the fluorescence which increases after 30 min if ATP and Apyrase are contained in the buffer. Towards the end of the reaction the fluorescence of the RNA reduces again. If an inhibitor is added to the reaction the fluorescence stays at one level without steeper decrease.

Results: During the transcription the Blanks stayed on the same level of signal. We do not have any background in presence of the malachite green dye in the blank. Throughout the assay, no increase of fluorescence of the Malachite Green Aptamer and no decrease of the fluorescence of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 was measured. At the beginning we can see a change in fluorescence for samples containing the ATP Aptamer Spinach2. We estimate that the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 changes its RNA structure when it gets heated up to 37 °C. This will result in a change in fluorescence till the complete mixture has adjusted to 37 °C. In the functional assay containing all ligands, dyes and constructs, we can observe an increase of fluorescence emitted by the Malachite Green Aptamer and a decrease  of the fluorescence signal given by the ATP Aptamer Spinach2/DFHBI complex that is connected to the uptake of ATP that is now bonded to the RNA strand.
▼2015-08-30  26. Analyzing the in vitro Transcription via Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
26. Analyzing the in vitro Transcription via Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
Aim: Comparison of traditional methods to analyze small molecule changes. Thin layer chromatography will be applied to analyze ATP consumption during in vitro transcription. To analyze ATP consumptions during the RNA transcription, ATP is converted to AMP after the transcription process by Apyrase
Procedure:
Transcription has been performed under the same conditions as described in previous assays such as protocol 22
As a template we used the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2
5 µL samples were taken every 5 min from the reaction
Samples were heated up to 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate the T7 RNA polymerase
After 1:30 h of incubation 0.01 U Apyrase and 4 mM CaCl2 were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C
2 µL of each sample was spotted on a fluorophore coated TLC Plate (ALUGRAM®Xtra SIL G/UV254, Macherey Nagel)
Mobile phase contained 4:6 1 M Ammonium acetat: ethanol
TLC ran for 4 h 45 min at room temperature
Results:
Pyrophosphate precipitate was observed during the in vitro transcription, which is a sign for a successful reaction. ATP could be converted to AMP by Apyrase as well and monitored by TLC. However TLC method is not sensitive enough to measure small changes in ATP concentration during in vitro transcription reactions.

Precipitated RNA was washed with 70 % isopropanol and centrifuged again using the same conditions as above

Fluorescence was measured in the spectro fluorometer JASCO
Conditions:

Emission spectra: 475 nm to 600 nm
Sensitivity: High
Temperature: 37 °C
Results: Every Spinach variation except for the c-di GMP Aptamer Mutant Spinach2 showed a peak at 500 nm as expected. Furthermore we were able to detect a new peak at &lambda;= 552 nm for the c-di GMP Aptamer Spinach2 which is higher than the peak at 500 nm.

Aim: Purification of the Spinach2 for further experiments
Procedure:
RNA was eluted from the gel in 0.3 M sodium acetate pH 5.5

Kinetic Cycle
Number of Cycles: 50
Interval: every 30 sec
Total Time: 25 min
Results: The assay was performed with two controls. One sample did not contain DFHBI, the other one did not have the Spinach2 RNA. The blank with no DFHBI shows a low background, whereas the control with DFHBI shows a big background (RFU= 841). However the emission of the Spinach2 containing DFHBI shows higher values (RFU= 3586) than the controls, concluding the functionality of the Spinach2 construct.
