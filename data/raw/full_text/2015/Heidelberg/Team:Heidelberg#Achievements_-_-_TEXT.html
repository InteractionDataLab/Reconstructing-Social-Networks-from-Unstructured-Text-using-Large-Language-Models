We established a NEW APPROACH to work with all types of functional nucleic acids, setting the foundations for their widespread use in synthetic biology
We developed a NEW STANDARD to easily clone functional RNAs for their expression in vitro and in vivo (RFC 110)
We established a NOVEL dual-color readout system to monitor the in vitro transcription of an RNA of interest based on a new ATP-switchable Spinach II aptamer
We established a NOVEL detection method for short ssDNAs and ssRNAs based on the HRP-mimicking DNAzyme
We designed de novo an ACTIVE SITE for twin ribozyme and proved its efficient cleavage activity in living yeast cells
We conceived and implemented an open-source SOFTWARE FOR THE DESIGN OF APTAMERS (MAWS) as a fast and affordable alternative to the laborious SELEX procedure
We conceived and implemented an open-source SOFTWARE ASSISTING THE DESIGN OF APTAZYMES (JAWS) to enable the construction of new sensing devices
We EXPERIMENTALLY VALIDATED several of our designed aptamers and aptazymes and fed the collected data back into the algorithms
We proved the PRINCIPLE that a ketamine-switchable aptazyme could be used to implement a TEST STRIPE to detect RAPE DRUGS in situ
We developed the APTABODY, an aptamer-based alternative to antibodies that drastically reduces the costs of performing WESTERN BLOTTING and allows to target proteins for which antibodies are not available
