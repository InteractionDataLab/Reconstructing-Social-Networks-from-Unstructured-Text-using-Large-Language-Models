What impact would it have to cure cystic fibrosis by correcting the causing dysfunctional mRNA but without genetically modifying the patient?
How much safer could our cities be if rape would be prevented by an easy and discrete method to detect drugs ulteriorly poured  in drinks?
What could be discovered if every research lab had the possibility to perform cheap and fast western blotting for every protein?
Nature has provided us with the right tools: functional nucleic acids
We made it possible to design functional nucleic acids following the concepts of modularization and standardization
We created a new standard to clone them and work with them, in vitro and in vivo
We set up assays to validate our in silico designs and improve our designing rules
Dive deeper into the ocean of our project to find out how we set the foundations to elevate functional nucleic acids to a new leading role in synthetic biology.

Awards won at the Giant Jamboree
Best Foundational Advance Project
This year, Undergrad and Overgrad teams competed for the same Best Foundational Advance Project Award.
iGEMers Prize
For a team which spend most of the semester in the lab, working countless hours late into the night and the following morning this ist the most rewarding prize. All 224 teams at the Jamboree voted on whom has the greatest project and would deserve the most to win the Grand Prize. We are very grateful for the honor that comes with the iGEMers prize, it really shows the appreciation of out work by the other teams, thank you!
Second Runner Up, Undergrad
We are very proud to be voted third amongst over 140 other undergrad teams!
Finalist, Undergrad
All 144 undergrad teams are graded by their judges and the three teams with the highest overall score get to be finalists and compete for the big 'Grand Prize'.
Best Poster, Undergrad
This prize honors posters and poster presentations which are attractive, clear, and concisely present the team's work.
Nominated for Best Software Tool, Undergrad
Regardless what's the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the bigger project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can even prove surprisingly useful for others. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such "nuggets" of computational work.
Nominated for Best Applied Design, Undergrad
This is a prize for the team that has developed a synbio product to solve a real world problem in the most elegant way. The students will have considered how well the product addresses the problem versus other potential solutions, how the product integrates or disrupts other products and processes, and how its lifecycle can more broadly impact our lives and environments in positive and negative ways.
Nominated for Best Wiki, Undergrad
The team Wikis serve as the main project information resource for future iGEM students and teams, as well as the rest of the world. This award honors the “model” Wiki page, which exemplifies what the following year’s Wikis should strive for.
