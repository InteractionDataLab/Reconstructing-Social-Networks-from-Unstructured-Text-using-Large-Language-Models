Finally, the combination of the JAWS Software and the fluorescent readout enables the scientific community the possibility to target specifically any small molecule of interest <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>.

Small molecules are known to regulate many cellular functions. Hence, the development of innovative techniques to analyze metabolic pathways became an important field in research. Those assays require a variety of tools allowing the user to detect small molecules even within live cells<X-REF>Fernandez-Suarez2008</X-REF><X-REF>Tyagi2009</X-REF>. Such methods hold promise to solve the mechanisms of transcription, translation, localization and the function of non-coding RNA. 
The most common ways to analyze small molecules or cellular pathways include protein-based methods like GFP or molecule reactive probes which have been engineered in the past. Having a fluorescent readout seems to be a valuable implement to provide time-resolved information <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I>. Recently, Paige et al. discovered an RNA that mimics the green fluorescent protein (GFP) so called “Spinach” <X-REF>Paige2011</X-REF><X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF><X-REF>Strack2015</X-REF>. This Spinach aptamer was generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). In presence of the 3’5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidne imidazolinone dye (DFHBI), RNA forms a stable Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex, which is fluorescent. Since then Spinach has been successfully applied by several laboratories to image RNA in live cells<X-REF>Buxbaum2015</X-REF><X-REF>Dean2014</X-REF>. Moreover, this RNA has been used as a tool to monitor RNA synthesis in real-time<X-REF>Höfer2013</X-REF><X-REF>Pothoulakis</X-REF><I>in vitro</I> or to sense different small molecule levels <I>in vivo</I><X-REF>Kellenberger2015</X-REF><X-REF>Kellenberger2013</X-REF>. A prominent example is the sensing of ci-di-GMP concentrations in live cells. To do so, Kellenberger <I>et al.</I> attached a ci-di-GMP aptamer to the Spinach aptamer. In presence of a small molecule (c-di-GMP) the aptamer forms a functional stem which results in the formation of a fluorescent Spinach-DFHBI RNA aptamer-complex. Thus, small molecule concentrations can be determined by a fluorescence read-out system.
</P><P class="basictext">
In our project we are interested in small molecules that are difficult to sense using common techniques. Here we will describe an innovative system that uses the Spinach2 fused to a specific aptamer to detect small molecules. In 2013 the Jaffrey Lab developed Spinach2 which shows in comparison to Spinach a better folding efficiency and thermostability. <X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF>. To generate aptamers that specifically bind to a small molecule, we will use our software <B>JAWS</B>. Using this set up we will be able to show that our software is capable to support time consuming methods like SELEX, to identify Aptamers that bind specifically to small molecules. As an interesting target, we will sense the small molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in biochemical reactions. A common method that is performed in thousands of laboratories is a <I>in vitro</I> transcriptions To study the function of ribonucleic acids, RNA is generally prepared by <I>in vitro</I> transcription<X-REF>Beckert2011</X-REF>. Using bacteriophage DNA dependent RNA polymerases (T7, T3, Sp6), a variety of different RNAs can be enzymatically synthesized in the lab. In this context we want to establish a new biochemical readout method, called <B>real-time SMS</B>, to record simultaneously small molecules (ATP) and enzymatic kinetics (RNA polymerase) using Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system.

Common techniques to sense small molecules in biochemical reactions are most likely connected to radioactive labeling. The exposure to radioactive sources is known to result in damage of the genetic information and is therefore more and more banished from lab work. However because of its sensitivity, radioactive chemicals are needed to monitor small changes of those molecules. 
</P><P class="basictext">
A common method that is performed in many laboratories is an <I>in vitro</I> transcription (Fig. 1A). This method is usually performed in a black-box manner. To analyze the decrease of nucleotide trisphosphate over time as well as to determine the success of the <I>in vitro</I> transcription, scientists use radioactive labelled nucleotide triphosphates and perform time demanding acrylamide gel electrophoresis.

To establish such tool box, two different fluorescent RNA constructs will be applied: The first construct is a fusion of an ATP aptamer<X-REF>Sassanfar1993</X-REF> and Spinach2<X-REF>Strack2013</X-REF> (Fig. 1B), which we will call <B>Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system </B>. To improve the binding of the ATP aptamer to ATP we apply our own implemented JAWS software. Using our software, nucleotides which form the stem region of the ATP aptamer can be predicted, which will improve binding properties of this RNA to ATP. The fusion of this aptamer to the Spinach2 enables us a fluorescent read out in real-time. Thus, in presence of this small molecule, the ATP aptamer will form a tight stem loop, which results in a new structural conformation of the Spinach aptamer. Finally after binding of the ATP, the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer is able to interact with the DFHBI. Hereby fluorescence can be measured at 500 nm if the Spinach was excited at 460 nm. We will generate using our <B>JAWS software</B> different Spinach2-ATP-Aptamers. To validate the software as well as to identify the best Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system, we will analyze them concerning their fluorescent turn-on effect in presence of ATP.

                General overview of our real time SMS tool-box, which allows the monitoring of the ATP consumption during <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction. For this purpose we designed a DNA template containing a promoter (T7) according to the applied RNA polymerase, RNA of interest (ROI), Hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) and Malachite Green Aptamer (MGA). If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox is a fusion of Spinach2 to an ATP-binding Aptamer, predicted by our JAWS software. In presence of ATP, the ATP Aptamer forms a stem, enabling the DFHBI dye to bind to the Spinach Aptamer thereby triggering fluorescence emission.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P class="basictext">
The second important part of the toolbox is a DNA template containing a promoter according to the applied RNA polymerase and a <B>Malachite Green Aptamer</B> (Fig. 1C), which is excited at 630 nm and emits at 652 nm in presents of malachite green dye. If the Malachite Green Aptamer is transcribed, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. The second part of the toolbox allows a direct analysis of the success of the <I>in vitro</I> transcription in real-time. In an advanced set up, this system can be extended by DNA template encoding for the RNA of interest (ROI) and a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Both fragments are inserted between the promotor and the Malachite Green Aptamer. Inducing the hammerhead ribozyme allows cleavage during the <I>in vitro</I> transcription. Hereby two RNA fragments emerge, the ROI and the hammerhead ribozyme fused to Malachite Green Aptamer (HHR-MGA). Using such setup, the emitted fluorescence of the HHR-MGA will be independent on the applied ROI. Thus the fluorescence induced by the Malachite Green Aptamer can be applied to compare efficiencies of different RNAs at the same time.

The combination of two aptamers that are able to turn on fluorescence by binding to DFHBI or malachite green provide us the possibility to monitor simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis during <I>in vitro</I> transcription in real-time (Fig. 2). The application of the JAWS software generates us the best ATP-aptamer to identify even small changes during RNA synthesis.

To validate the JAWS-generated aptamers as well as to show the functionality of the Spinach2-ATP-Aptamer system we will apply different bacteriophage RNA polymerases (T7, Sp6, T3) that are commonly used.

To establish a stable, reproducible system in lab that is able to sense small molecules in real time using a fluorescent readout, we applied the already published c-di-GMP Spinach2 system first<X-REF>Kellenberger2013</X-REF>. To design new small molecule sensors, we adapted the system described by Kellenberger <I>et al.</I> We exchanged the second stem of Spinach2 by three different ATP Aptamer systems (Fig. 3). All of them are based on an ATP Aptamer described by Szostak. ATP Aptamer Spinach2 is the original aptamer that was generated by Szostak. ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 and the ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 contain the core sequence of the original ATP Aptamer, but have a modified stem, generated by our software JAWS. In presence of the ATP ligand, the ATP aptamer should change its tertiary structure and forms together with the Spinach2 a stem. The stem formations should finally result in an increase of the fluorescence. Using this read-out system we can compare the JAWS-generated Aptamers with the original one, described by Szostak. If our JAWS software works nicely, we should get a better fluorescent read-out with ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 or ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach2 in comparison to the original ATP Aptamer Spinach2 construct.

Analyzing biochemical reactions depend on radioactive labeling. Yet, many laboratories try to avoid the usage of radioactivity since it is connected to affect the health.

Common techniques like TLC have a very poor limit of detection. Especially in our studies, a highly sensitive method is needed to visualize ATP concentration in biochemical reactions. Thus, we can apply our ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 system so sense consumption of ATP in real time (Fig. 6). To show the general feasibility of our system we titrated the T7 RNA polymerase concentration in <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction. We monitored the fluorescence signal of the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 in regular intervals. In presence of a high RNA polymerase concentration we would expect the highest turn-off effect of the fluorescence. In Figure 6B we show the results of the real time measurements of the spinach fluorescence. As expected we can show that the ATP signal decreases rapidly in presence of a high concentration of polymerase. In contrast, if less RNA polymerase was applied, the measured fluorescence is much higher. To confirm the results of the fluorescence measurements, we analyzed the <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction using denaturing acrylamide gels in addition (Fig. 6C). Similar to the fluorescent readout, we were able to identify the most intense bands in presence of high T7 RNA polymerase.

Especially buffers are known to have a huge influence on the activity of the polymerase which can probably improve the transcription of the DNA template “substrate of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme”.

For the buffer screen we applied six different buffer systems: Three transcription buffers pH 8.1 with different spermidine concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 10 mM, Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.1, HEPES buffer pH 7.5 (similar to the renaturing buffer) and a buffer including BSA pH 8.1. All buffers were analyzed using the same conditions as described in previous assays. As DNA template we applied the Malachite Green Aptamer with T7 promotor. Using our fluorescent read out system we can determine different transcription efficiencies. In presence of the HEPES buffer no increase of the Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence signal was monitored (Fig. 10A). Furthermore the signal of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 stays also at the same level as the blank.

The transcription buffer (1 mM and 10 mM) shows the highest slope of Malachite Green Aptamer fluorescence and the fastest decrease of the ATP Aptamer Spinach2 fluorescence (Fig. 10C).

To overcome the dependence of the setup to apply a specific polymerase we designed new transcription templates containing different promoters for a subset of commercial available RNA polymerase such as T7 Phi 2.5, T3, Sp6 and E. coli (T7A1) (Fig. 12A). All polymerases have been tested for 12 hours at 37 °C and were measured in regular time intervals using TECAN Safire. The results show that the decrease of ATP AptamerJWAS1 Spinach2 activity is connected to the speed of the RNA polymerase. The data indicates that the reduction of ATP goes faster for T7 and T7Phi 2.5 than for the other candidates (Fig. 12B). Therefore the fluorescence of ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach2 decreases. The T3 polymerase is a little bit slower than the T7 RNA polymerase and does not reach the same bottom point. Nevertheless the graph decreases still over time and the polymerase seem to be active even after 500 min of the reaction. The Sp6 shows activity as well. The Sp6 leads to higher Malachite Green Aptamer production by using less ATP or leading to more functional RNA, while the T3 has a lower ATP Aptamer Spinach2 activity than Malachite Green Aptamer.

To sense specifically small molecules in biochemical reactions is problem that scientist tried to solve since many years. </P><P class="basictext">
In this project we developed an innovative method that can be applied as a tool box, enabling us to sense small molecules in real-time (real-time SMS) using a fluorescent readout at two different emission wavelengths. Using a spinach aptamer fused to an ATP aptamer we can sense ATP concentrations in real-time during a biochemical reaction. Thus we were able to analyze classical <I>in vitro</I> transcriptions in detail by monitoring simultaneously the ATP consumption as well as RNA strand synthesis. 
</P><P class="basictext">
A <B>major achievement</B> of our fluorescent tool-box was the validation of our own implemented JAWS software. ATP Aptamer-stems were successfully predicted which were causing a high turn-on effect of the fluorescence in presence of the small molecule. The ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA shows a stronger interaction with ATP resulting in a higher fluorescence maximum than the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach RNA. However, the tight binding to the small molecule ATP can result in a decreased bioavailability of this NTP for the polymerase. This results in decreased transcription efficiency. Due to this effect we decided to apply the ATP AptamerJAWS1 Spinach for our fluorescent read-out system. Nevertheless live-cell imaging might benefit from the good binding properties of ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA. Imaging of ATP in cells might be also an interesting target to study.
</P><P class="basictext">
Another important achievement was the monitoring of the change of ATP concentrations during the <I>in vitro</I> transcription. We can show that the concentration of used amount of polymerase changes the final RNA yield. We increased the polymerase concentration and observed low Spinach and high malachite green fluorescence levels. Thus ATP was consumed and RNA was successfully transcribed. In addition we were able to show the influence of different buffer systems, inhibitors and different polymerase. Using this huge amount of generated Data, we were able to model in vitro transcription reactions and to analyze the speed of nucleotide incorporation. By application of our tool-box, a <I>in vitro</I> transcription reaction can be optimized within a few hours. Thus difficult transcription targets can be easily optimized. 
</P><P class="basictext">
Furthermore, we were able to set-up a method to quantify the RNA yields in real-time. Similar to classical colorimetric assays like Bradford, we successfully applied instead of BSA, our Malachite Green Aptamer RNA to generate a calibration curve with a really good correlation coefficient.
In addition, the JAWS generated ATP aptamer Spinach can be applied in several other biochemical reactions that depend on ATP. In interesting target would be the Poly(A) polymerase<X-REF>Balbo2007</X-REF>, that attaches several adenosine moieties to the 3’-end of RNAs in eukaryotes.
</P><P class="basictext">
Furthermore, by using the JAWS software we can generate new sensors that are specifically binding to new interesting small molecules for example rape drugs, cofactors like NAD(H) or FAD. The generated aptamers could be fused to the Spinach and binding can be monitored by an increase of the fluorescence in presence of the small molecule.
</P><P class="basictext">
Those generated aptamers might by also applicable for live-cell imaging to sense small molecules. We have already demonstrated for ATP AptamerJAWS2 Spinach RNA a good binding efficiency, which might be a good candidate for imaging experiments as well.
