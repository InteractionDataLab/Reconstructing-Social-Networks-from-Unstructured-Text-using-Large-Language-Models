Our proposal is to create a system which allows us to measure a biological signal precisely and without delay. But we are not the first who make this kind of attempt. In 2008 Harvard iGem team developed a similar idea: they introduce a plasmid into Shewanella oneidensis which contain a Lac promoter   coupled with gene that codifies to mtrB cytochrome.  The last protein belongs to an oxidation complex that reduces minerals by electron transference. Hence, Shewanella produced an electrical signal when stimulated with lactose.
On the other hand, Chile 2012 coupled a bioluminescent molecule to the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Their aim was to produce a bioluminescent cyanobacteria which lights up during dusk hours and regenerates the substrates during the day. And Cornell 2012 create a biosensor that generates and electrical output of to measure water quality in areas affected by oil and gas extraction. They also used the Shewanella cytochromes complex to produce the electrical signal.
