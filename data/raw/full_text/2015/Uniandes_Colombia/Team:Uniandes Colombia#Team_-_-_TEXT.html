The Team
Pedro José Quiroga Padilla
He is a fourth semester medicine student. His passion is to understand how we can think,  How the brain design enable us to accomplish this amazing task! However, learn about the brain is not the only think he enjoy: every attempt to understand the molecular basis of life and, contrary to this microscopic world, Pedro is amateur astronomer. The last fact is what motivates him to support in Maloka (a non-governmental organization) one time per month on Sky watching. Actually, he is trying to be involved in the scientific world and advance in his career, without forget to grow like a human, be happy and take risks.
Gabriela Melisa Montaño
Gabriela studies Biology at the Universidad de los Andes. However, that alone doesn’t define her completely. Sure, her future year self would like to would like to unravel the different mechanisms of evolution and diversity, observe living things, model relationships between them, put a little math and computer science in there, but who knows? She might discover a lot more things along the way. Science, though, has made her change her perception about magic, although she still likes fiction in most of its forms. She writes reaaally occasionally and doodles in class. She truly enjoyed engaging in this year’s Project, because of the things she learned, and the awesome people she met. She hopes there is a lot more where that came from next year!
 
Mauricio Neira
Mauricio is a physics and microbiology undergraduate student. His interests include synthetic biology, biotechnology, astrobiology, artificial intelligence, jazz and heavy metal. When not nerding out about the awesomeness of the world, he's probably playing music.
Diego Alexander Hernandez Caro
Diego is an undergrad student of microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. He is passionate about everything related with sciences, mainly, in the molecular biology applied to microorganisms and how it can be used in the medicine. He joined this year in the IGEM team because he thinks in all the application of synthetic biology in the future and this is the best way to learn about laboratory techniques related with molecular biology. In his free time he enjoys playing the guitar, swimming,  listening to music and sharing time with his friends.

Andrés Felipe Pereira Rosero
Andrés is a medicine undergraduate at Universidad de los Andes. He is thrilled with all the possible applications of synthetic biology in medicine. For him iGem seems to be the best place for learning all about the synthetic biology world. Ü
 
Valentina Mazzanti Gómez
Valentina is an undergraduate student at the Universidad de los Andes. She decided to be part of of this great team because she wants to keep working on investigation for the rest of her life. Besides, she studies medicine and feels passionate about detection and further healing of diseases that affect large populations in her country.
Eitan Scher Nemirovsky
Eitan is an undergraduate Medicine and Biology double major freshman at Universidad de los Andes. He joined iGEM this year because he was amazed by the still untapped potential of synthetic biology. His vision is to integrate the later with Medicine so he can exploit the benefits of both, helping the health system providing easy and accessible methods of disease detection and hormone mass production. Though this is his first experience with molecular biology he is always eager to jump right into the lab and learn his way
 
Pablo Cárdenas Ramírez
Pablo is an undergrad student at Universidad de Los Andes. He is interested in synthetic biology, biotech, and the ethics involved in these areas (as well as all of science) in the context of improving public health, education, and social awareness. He is an enthusiastic supporter of open science, open source, and strange music, and is glad to participate in projects like this year's iGEM.
Paula Siauchó Unriza.
Paula is an undergraduate student in Physics and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. She loves knowledge, she is very curious and she love everything related to science, specially anything related with live and how it can be modeled and understood with Physics, it's amazing!. That's why she like so much iGEM and this year she works, for the second time,  in mathematical models. The application to the common life is also important for her and, off course, the experience of being part of this wonderful team.
 
Santiago Tíjaro
Santiago is an undergrad student of chemistry and microbiology at Los Andes university. He thinks that synthetic biology is an incredible science field that will change the future of humanity. He loves science and he want to learn everything about it as much as he can so be part of this team has been an incredible opportunity to improve his knowledge about team and lab work.
 
Roberto Moran Tovar
Roberto is a last year Physics student at Universidad de los Andes. This year is his third time as a member of iGEM team of Los Andes Colombia. He is the leader of the mathematical model group of the project. Physics has been always his great love, but biology always appears in the middle. :D He likes to play soccer a lot and to listen to good Rock and Roll.
Sofía Alfonso
Sofía is a B.Sc in Microbiology who just finished her undergraduate studies this semester! :) She is very curious about how life develops in a microscopic scale. She loves anything involving genes and bacteria, and is also a fan of fluorescent microscopy techniques! Modeling gene expression and genetic circuits is something she considers really interesting which is why she decided to join the Modeling team. She is also in charge of managing our team’s relationships with other teams.
 
Carlos Sánchez
Carlos Sánchez studies microbiology and physics at Universidad de los Andes, likes traveling, camping and reading in his free time. Always eager to learn new things about everything.
 
Juan Manuel Pedraza, Ph.D.
Dr. Pedraza leads the Systems/Synthetic Biology division of the Biophysics Laboratory at Uniandes. His specialty is stochasticity in gene expression, but is getting more and more interested in evolution and the consequences of phenotypic variability.
Silvia Restrepo, Ph.D.
Dr. Restrepo is the leader and main researcher at the Mycology and Plant Disease Laboratory at Universidad de los Andes . Additionally, she is Vicechancellor of Research of Universidad de los Andes Faculty of Sciences . Her main research topic is phytopathology, and her favorite organism is Phytophthora infestans Website: Lab Page
