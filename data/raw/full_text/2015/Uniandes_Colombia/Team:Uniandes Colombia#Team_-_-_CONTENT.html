His passion is to understand how we can think,  How the brain design enable us to accomplish this amazing task! However, learn about the brain is not the only think he enjoy: every attempt to understand the molecular basis of life and, contrary to this microscopic world, Pedro is amateur astronomer. The last fact is what motivates him to support in Maloka (a non-governmental organization) one time per month on Sky watching. Actually, he is trying to be involved in the scientific world and advance in his career, without forget to grow like a human, be happy and take risks.</SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Gabriela Melisa Montaño</STRONG><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriela studies Biology at the Universidad de los Andes. However, that alone doesn’t define her completely. Sure, her future year self would like to would like to unravel the different mechanisms of evolution and diversity, observe living things, model relationships between them, put a little math and computer science in there, but who knows? She might discover a lot more things along the way. Science, though, has made her change her perception about magic, although she still likes fiction in most of its forms. She writes reaaally occasionally and doodles in class. She truly enjoyed engaging in this year’s Project, because of the things she learned, and the awesome people she met. She hopes there is a lot more where that came from next year!</SPAN></P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG><STRONG> </STRONG></STRONG></P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Mauricio Neira</STRONG><SPAN style="font-weight: 400;">Mauricio is a physics and microbiology undergraduate student.
