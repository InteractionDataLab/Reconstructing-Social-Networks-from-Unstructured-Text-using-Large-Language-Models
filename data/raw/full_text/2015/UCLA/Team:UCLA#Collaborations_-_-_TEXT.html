Cloning Guide with TU Eindhoven
First, we were very motivated to discuss the potential for iterative capped assembly to open the doors for other iGEM teams to explore new features of protein synthesis. To achieve this, we collaborated with the great members of the TU Eindhoven iGEM Team, for whom we developed a cloning guide for ICA.  Our entry in their guide discussing the background, process, workflow, and troubleshooting tips necessary to utilize this system.  Our collaboration has not only benefited iGEM teams who wish to learn the technique, but also helped us gain a better sense of the implications of our research toward advanced synthetic biology. We envision ICA as a cloning technique that can be widely adapted not only to those using our parts collection generate novel silk genes, but for any team who wishes to rapidly and controllably assembly long repetitive genetic structures for functional use.
Feel free to browse through the cloning guide.
First Annual Southern California iGEM Meetup
The UCLA iGEM was honored to hold the first ever Southern California iGEM Meetup on Thursday, August 6th.  Team members from the University of California, San Diego ( UCSD ), University of La Verne and La Ca√±ada High School , and the LA Biohackers Community Lab attend our meetup at the Molecular Biology Institute at UCLA.  Here is a link to the powerpoint we delivered at the meet up, and below are pictures from our event.  Teams discussed their ongoing projects and offered advice to members struggling with certain aspects of their experimental design, and discussed the pertinent issues for all iGEM teams in terms of logistics, team organization and project design.  Additionally, we discussed the state of iGEM and synthetic biology as a rapidly emerging biotechnology field in the United States, especially in the context of developing scientific communications to combat rising negative publicity and misinformation toward the use and safety of genetically modified organisms. Through our meet up, we hope to spur not only a collaborative experience in local teams to work together in solving synthetic biology problems, but also a space where teams can discuss  maintenance and sustained success of an iGEM team, especially in dire financial circumstances We hope to increase of presence in the California community, and encourage both Northern Californian and local high school teams to attend our meet up, in an effort to sustain further project collaboration.
iGEM Team Mentorship and Development
Outside of the meet up, we were honored to help assist in the development and conception of multiple iGEM teams in the local area.  Through advice and collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Tsui of the University of La Verne and David Yao, co-founder and advisor of the UCLA iGEM team, we delivered a talk at the University of La Verne to discuss our project and potential avenues for synthetic biology research at an undergraduate level.  From this seminar and from our work with Dr. Tsui, we are honored to have helped inspire and start the University of La Verne iGEM team!
Additionally we are honored to begin our work in assisting and developing the projects of the Granada Hills Charter High School iGEM Team, a newly formed team organized by student Anoop Nanda and advisor Jeanette Chapleu.  We are excited about the prospects of working in conjunction with this local LAUSD high school to bring STEM Education and scientific research to the San Fernando Valley area!
Lastly, UCLA iGEM project coordinator Fasih Ahsan was selected as a team mentor for the TecCEM iGEM team through the AlumniGEM mentorship program.  From this , Fasih assisting in implementing, designing, and mentoring much of the TEcCEM project, especially in the potential avenues for characterization of their BioBricks, feedback on the Jamboree presentation and project description, and in offering assistance for protocol troubleshooting.  He was honored to have worked with them this summer!
