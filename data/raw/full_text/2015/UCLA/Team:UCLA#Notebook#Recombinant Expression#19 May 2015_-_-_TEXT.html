Starter culture failure
Yesterday's attempt at creating a starter culture from the 5th plating of the old transformatants did NOT grow.  We hit an OD600 of 0.004, basically negligible growth.
Created new 11mL LB supplemented with 11uL 1000x Ampicillin (final 1x concentration 50ug/uL) starter cultures with colonies picked from 1/21 platings -- Plates 1,2,4,5.
Incubated plates at 37 degrees shaking at 1415.  Will check OD of starter cultures at 1900.
1L Expression of Tamura construct
Inoculated 950 mL of LB supplemented with 1mL of 100x Carbenicillin (final concentration 100ug/uL) with 10mL starter culture grown overnight.
Shook cells in 37 degrees Celsius until an OD600 of 0.6 is reached.
Induced protein expression using 5mL of 100mM IPTG stock (final concentration 0.5mM).
Gene expression monitoring
Removed 1mL of culture before adding IPTG and at 1-hour intervals after addition of IPTG, until after 5 hours after gene expression induction.
Spun down cells for 15 minutes at 5,300 ref at 4 degrees Celsius, and decanted supernatant.
Weighed wet pellet using analytical balance.
Julian's Work
grew a 10mL starter culture by picking a colony from the plate. Grew in LB with Chlor at 1000X dilution. Grew in shaking incubator at 37C
grew well in ~12 hours
Danny and I also met with Mark Arbing:
Lysis
Using the Dnase and Lysosyme is ok. We need protease inhibitors too*
For our lysis buffer it should be high salt (100-150mM), pH balanced (around 7-8), can add some glycerol or other stuff too
we can add some EDTA too but then we need to buffer exchange it before we load it onto the Ni column
We can use the french press or sonication (just ask him for help or training). They also have like a fancy french press we can use which he recommended if we use a machine for lysis
you still need the lysis buffer for this tough
Purification
we can use our gravity column with an IMAC resin and that's fine
we need to store our protein in a buffer that's not super high salt
so we can elute, dialyze or buffer exchange
the lysis buffer can be the same as the initial buffer for the column though the lysis shouldn't have any imidizole
if that column doesnâ€™t work well we can ask to use his HPLC machine
they will run it for us
we need to provide the sample (1-10mL for SEC)
we need to provide a buffer too
I think SEC is better than trying to do ion exchange
