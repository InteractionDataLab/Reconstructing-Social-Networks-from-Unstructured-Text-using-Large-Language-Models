Gel Purification for M1-AB, BC, CA
Used zymo kit.
All around 25 ng/uL concentration, eluted in 15 uL.
PCA for M1-Seq1, M1-Seq2 Cores
M1-Seq1
Calculated 67 C annealing for overlap region
Test 65 C, 68 C.
M1-Seq2
Calculated 63 C annealing for overlap region
Test 62 C, 64 C.
Set up 2x 25 uL reactions for each M1-Seq core.

Results
Fig. 1 PCA of the M1-Seq Cores. The expected product size is 80 bp. The product for M1-Seq1 exhibits accessory bands. The product for M1-Seq2 appears mostly clean.
The proper bands were excised, then gel purified.
Digestion for M1-9, M2-15(1C3)
Digestion was in 50 uL reactions, with 1 uL of the appropriate enzymes.

Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Run results on 1% TAE gel, used 2 uL of NEB 1kb ladder.
Fig. 2 Digestion of M2-15(1C3) with XbaI, PstI for subcloning into BBa_K525998. The expected product size is 1.6 kb. This band was excised for gel extraction.
ICA for M1-12
Incubated initiator for 1 hr.
Used 100 uL washes.
3 minute ligation times.
Elute in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20.
Ligation
Ligated M2-15(X,P) into BBa_K525998(S,P)
Ligated M1-9(E,P) into pSB1C3(E,P).
20 uL reactions.
Ligate 25 C for 1 hr, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Transformation
Transform M2-15(T7) into BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells.
Transform M1-9(1C3) into DH5(alpha) electro-competent cells.
