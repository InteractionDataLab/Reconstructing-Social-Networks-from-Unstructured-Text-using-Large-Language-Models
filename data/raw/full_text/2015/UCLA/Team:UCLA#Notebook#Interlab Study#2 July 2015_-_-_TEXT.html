Resuspended BioBrick plamids.
Resuspended BioBricks BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106, BBa_J23117, BBa_I3504, BBa_I270260, and BBa_R0040 in 10uL of nuclease free ddH2O, according to registry instructions.  Aliquots were incubated at room temp in the wells for 5 minutes to reabsorb all dried DNA, and transferred to PCR tubes, labeled, and stored at -20 degrees Celsius.
Transformed all BioBrick plasmids in 5-alpha electrocompetent E. coli.
Conducted using the protocol listed here.
With the exception of BBa_I3504, all transformed cell lines were grown on chloramphenicol supplemented plates. (504 requires ampicillin ABX).
200uL and 50uL aliquots of each of the 1mL rescued cells were plates using sterile glass beads on each plate, respectively.
Plates were inverted, labeled, and incubated for 16 hours in 37 degrees Celsius.
Results of the transformations are HERE.
