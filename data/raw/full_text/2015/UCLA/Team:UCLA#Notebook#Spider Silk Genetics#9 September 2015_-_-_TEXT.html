Sequencing Results for M1-15(T7)
Both sequences are incorrect.
Both have the prefix, but the suffix only has PstI.
Decided to BLAST the insert.
The results have almost exact similarity to E. coli K-12 genome.
Due to lack of time, we will not finish cloning the M1-15 construct.
Digestion Gel Image
Digest every unique ICA construct that we have made so far using EcoRI and PstI for a final gel image.
Digest 1 ug of each (1C3) construct plasmid in a 50 uL reaction using 1 uL of each enzyme in NEBuffer 2.1
Visualize on a 1% TAE gel using 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 E,P digestion of MaSp constructs made using ICA this summer. The expected sizes are indicated on the right hand side. The expected size for the backbone is 2070 bp.
The result for M1-9 is slightly anomalous,The band at ~3 kb may be due to incomplete digestion. Will repeat tomorrow.
Also, there is a smear for M2-9 digestion. Will also repeat tomorrow.
