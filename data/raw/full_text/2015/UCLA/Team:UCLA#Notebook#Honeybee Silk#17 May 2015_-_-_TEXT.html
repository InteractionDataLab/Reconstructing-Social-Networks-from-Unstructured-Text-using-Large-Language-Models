Growing Cultures
Prepped 2 tubes of LB(5mL) with chloremphenicol and picked colonies of Bba-xxxx [1] to generate a starter culture for protein expression. Also prepped 2 tubes of of LB(5mL) with kanamycin and picked colonies of PET24a in order to miniprep and generate more plasmid.
We are growing the starter culture for the silk protein up to an OD of 0.8.
For the starter culture, because we started the incubation at 3pm, and we dont want to overgrow, we will put the cells in the 30 C shaker until tomorrow morning, at which point we will transfer to the 37 degree shaker.
The starter culture was placed in the 37 C incubator for one hour, and then transferred to the 30 C incubator at 4 PM
