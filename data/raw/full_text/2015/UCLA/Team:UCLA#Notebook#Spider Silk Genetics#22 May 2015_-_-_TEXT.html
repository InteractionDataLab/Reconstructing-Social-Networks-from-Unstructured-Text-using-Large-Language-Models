1. Amplification of MaSp2 2CA
We scaled up to 8x 50 uL reactions to amplify MaSp using the VF/R primer pair for conducting digestion and ligation testing.
For the template, we used 2CA diluted 1:1000 for a final concentration of 219 pg/uL.
We used the protocol below:

The reaction was set up as a master-mix without polymerase, which was added after distribution into the strips.
