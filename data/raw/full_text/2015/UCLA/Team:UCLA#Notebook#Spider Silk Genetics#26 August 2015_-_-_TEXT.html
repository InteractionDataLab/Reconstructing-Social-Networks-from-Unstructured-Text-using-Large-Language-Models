Transformation Results
Only 2 colonies present on the M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3) plate.
Possibly due to DNA loss during PCR purification.
Miniprep and Sequencing
Used Qiagen to miniprep 5 mL culture samples M1-12(1C3), M1/2[1:1]-12(1C3)/(T7), M1/2[2:1]-12(1C3)/(T7).
Sent to Genewiz for sequencing.
Used VF and VR primers for each.
Liquid Culture
Picked the two colonies into 5 mL LB + chlor.
