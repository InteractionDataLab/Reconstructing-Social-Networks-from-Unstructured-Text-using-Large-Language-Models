BsaI Digestion of MaSp2 AB, BC, CA
Same protocol as 7/13/2015 .
Sub-cloning M2-9(1C3) into BBa_K525998: Preparation
Digest 10 uL of plasmid (~2.8 ug) using 1 uL XbaI and 1 uL of PstI in a 50 uL reaction.
Used NEBuffer 2.1
Digest 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill 65 C for 20 min.
Gel-purify resulting product.
Cloning M2-12 into pSB1C3: Preparation
Digest 15 uL PCR product using 1 uL each of EcoRI and PstI in a 50 uL reaction
Used NEBuffer 2.1
Digest 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill 65 C for 20 min.
Gel-purify resulting product.
Gel Purification Results
Cast 1.5% TAE gel. Used 2 uL each of 100 bp ladder and 1 kb ladder from NEB.
Fig. 1 Gel image of results of BsaI Digestion, M2-9(1C3) digestion, and M2-12 digestion. The expected size for BsaI digestion is 102 bp. The expected size for M2-9 is 1018 bp. The expected size for M2-12 is 1324 bp.
Excised all the above indicated bands for gel purification.
Ligation
M2-9(1C3) into BBa_K525998, and M2-12 into pSB1C3.
Used [insilico.uni-duesseldorf.de ligation calculator] to determine amounts of DNA to add.
vector size: 2200 bp.
vector amount: 50 ng.
insert size:
M2-9: 1018 bp
M2-12: 11224 bp
vector to insert ration: 1 to 3
Calculated for 50 ng of vector, add:
69.41 ng for M2-9
83.45 ng for M2-12.
Ligation in 20 uL volumes.
Ligate 25 C for 25 min, heat kill 65 C for 10 min.
Transformation
Transformed M2-9(T7) into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells.
Transformed M2-12(1C3) into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells.
Previous tranformations of M2-mers(1C3) were performed using DH5(alpha) cells.
Rescues were at 37 C for 30 min.
Glycerol Stock Reconstitution
Plated M2-AB, M2-BC, M2-CA, and M2-SeqAB from glycerol stocks.
Aim to grow culture for DNA prep.
PCA of MaSp1 Temperature Testing
Testing annealing temperature for end-extension of the MaSp1 sequence.
NEB Tm calculator gives 64 C as ideal annealing temperature.

Results
Cast 1.5% TAE gel to visualize. Used 3 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 2 Temperature testing for PCR end-extension of MaSp1 core. The expected product is 170 bp.
Both temperatures work well, however, 64 C has less non-specific amplification. We will use 64 C to anneal tomorrow.
