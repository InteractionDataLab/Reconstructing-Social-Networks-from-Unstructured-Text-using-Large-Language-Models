8/24/2015
Gel extraction for M1/2[1:1]-12, M1/2[2:1]-12
Digestion for M1/2[1:1]-12, M1/2[2:1]-12
2 reactions for each.
Digest one reaction with E, P for cloning into pSB1C3.
Digest one reaction with X, P for cloning into BBa_K525998.
Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Products were PCR purified after digestion.
ICA for M1/2[1:2]-12
Used our finalized protocol .
Ligation
Ligated M1-12; M1/2[1:1]-12, M12[2:1]-12 in 20 uL reactions
M1-12 was ligated only into pSB1C3.
The others were ligated into pSB1C3 and BBa_K525998.
Transformation
Ligation products for M1-12(1C3), M1/2[1:1]-12(1C3), and M1/2[2:1]-12(1C3) were transformed into electrocompetent DH5(alpha) cells.
DNA was dialyzed against water prior to transformation
Ligation products for M1/2[1:1]-12(T7) and M1/2[2:1]-12(T7) were transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells.
