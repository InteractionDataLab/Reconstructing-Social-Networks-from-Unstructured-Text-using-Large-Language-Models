Gel Purification for M2 monomers
Used Zymo Kit. Concentrations around 25 ng/uL.
ICA for M1/2[2:1]-12
Used same ICA protocol as previous.
Initiator incubation for 45 minutes.
3 minute ligation per monomer.
100 uL washes.
Elute in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20 at 95 C for 5 min.
PCR amplification for M1-12, M1/2[1:1]-12, M1/2[2:1]-12
2x 50 uL reactions for each.
For M1-12, used a 1:100 dilution of previous PCR product, for a total of ~100 pg added to reaction.
For M1/2[1:1]-12 and M1/2[2:1]-12, used 1 uL of direct ICA eluate.

Results
Ran PCR products on a 1% TAE gel, used 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig 1. PCR amplification of different 12 mers. The expected product is 1324 bp for all reactions.
Excised the bands from M1/2[1:1]-12 and M1/2[2:1]-12 for purification.
The expected product in M1-12 is present, but in too little of a quantity to purify. May need to do PCR using a gel stab as template.
