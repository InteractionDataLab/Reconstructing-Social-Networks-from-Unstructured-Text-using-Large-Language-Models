Ran PCR product on 1% gel with 1kb ladder
Expected size of a 12-mer: ~1300bp
Gel purified the correct band but yield was too low (~5ng/uL in 15uL) for cloning
Need to redo PCR

Ran samples on 1% gel with 50bp ladder.
Expected size of M1SeqAB is 170bp
Both 1 and 2 showed band of the right size
Samples were PCR purified

Ran samples on 1% gel with NEB 1kb ladder
Bands of expected sizes were dim but still present. Picked three of each for sequencing.
