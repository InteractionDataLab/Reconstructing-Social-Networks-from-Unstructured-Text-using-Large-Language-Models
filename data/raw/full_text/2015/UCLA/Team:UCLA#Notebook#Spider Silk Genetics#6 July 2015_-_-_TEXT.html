MaSp2 Sequencing Core Assembly
PCA for MaSp2 Sequencing Core to be used for sequencing longer MaSp constructs.
Used the MaSp2 Seq Core 1-F (D-05) and MaSp Seq Core 1-R (E-05) to create full length MaSp sequencing core.

Results
Cast 1.5Â % TAE gel, used 2 uL of 50 bp ladder to visualize.
Fig. 1 Assembly of MaSp2 sequencing core. The size of the expected product is 84 bp.
The assembly was successful.
ICA using M-270 Beads
The Streptavidin M-270 Dynabeads came in today. We will test ligation of a 3-mer using these beads to see if we get a different result compared to using Magnabind Streptavidin beads.
Ligations were performed in 10 uL reactions using T7 ligase (Enzymatics), 50 ng of the relevant DNA, and 1 uL of the relevant 5 uM capping oligo.
5 uL of beads were used.
Washed twice using 2x BW buffer.
Resuspend washed beads in 5 uL 2x BW buffer, 1 uL of 5 uM initiator, and 4 uL ddH2O.
Rotate at RT for 45 minutes.
Wash twice using 0.5x BW buffer.

Final wash using ddH2O.
Elute in 15 uL 0.01% Tween-20 at 95 C for 3 min.
Saved Elution.
