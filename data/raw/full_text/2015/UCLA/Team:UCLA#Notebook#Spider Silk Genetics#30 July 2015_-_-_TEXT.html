Transformation Results
Colonies Present on M2-15(1C3) and M2-12(T7) plates.
Plan to do pick 4 colonies and analyze via colony PCR.
ICA for M1-9
45 minute initiator incubation time.
100 uL washes.
4 min ligation time at RT.
Prepared the reaction mixtures ahead of time.
Elute in 0.01% Tween-20
95 C for 5 min.
PCR Amplification for M1-9
1x 50 uL reaction.
Used ICA eluate as template, amplified using post-elution primers.

Colony PCR for M2-12(T7), M2-15(1C3)
Picked 4 colonies from each. Resuspended in 50 uL LB. Used 1 uL of resuspended colony as template.
used 2x Taq Red for colony PCR
Total 12.5 uL reaction for each colony.

Results
Cast 1% TAE gel. Used 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Visualized M1-9 and colony PCR results.
Fig. 1Results of Colony PCR for M2-12(T7) and M2-15(1C3), and PCR amplification of M1-9. The expected size for M1-9 is 1018 bp. The expected size for M2-12(T7) is 1.6 kb. The expected size for M2-15(1C3) is 1.9 kb.
The PCR amplification of M1-9 was successful. The band at 1018 kb was excised for gel purification.
Colonies 1, 2, 3, 4 for M2-12(T7) all appear to be correct. Will choose 3 for liquid culture and sequencing.
Colonies 1, 2 for M2-15(1C3) appear to be correct. Colonies 3, 4 appear incorrect. Will send colonies 1, 2 for sequencing, as well as one more picked colony from the plate.
Liquid Culture
Prepared 3x 5 uL cultures for M2-12(T7) and M2-15(1C3) each.
Inoculated with 25 uL of colony resuspended in 50 uL of LB.
