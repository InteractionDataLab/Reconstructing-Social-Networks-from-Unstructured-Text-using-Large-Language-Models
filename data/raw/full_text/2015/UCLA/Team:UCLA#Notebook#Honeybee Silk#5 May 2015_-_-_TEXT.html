Colony PCR of 5/4 Transformation
5/4 Transformation Results
Individual colonies were present on 1:1 plates, none/indiscernible present on 1:10 plates.
We picked 3 colonies from each the chloramphenicol plates (silk and silk+promoter) and suspended each in an epi tube with 99 uL ddH20.
Colony PCR Reaction
using Q5, transformed E. coli, and the VF2 and VR primers in preparation for insertion into psb1c3
Three 25 uL reactions each for:
Silk with VF2 and VR
SIlk+promoter with VF2 and VR

Gel Visualization of PCR Products
5uL of 6X loading dye was added to each 25uL PCR product
10uL of 1kb ladder was prepared with 2uL of 6X loading dye
I ran two 5uL samples of each PCR product against the ladder, one well was left empty between the different samples.
From left to right: Ladder, S1, S2, S3, SP1, SP2, SP3 Expected Band sizes: ~1200bp, ~1500bp File:Gel 5/5.tif
Inoculation
99uL of each sample was inoculated in 6 difference culture tubes containing 10mL LM and 1uL of 1000x chloramphenicol and incubated overnight at 37C.
