The Cultures Didn't Grow
The 14 cultures that I grew up yesterday, including the silk and pet vector in bl21 did not grow.
We suspect that either the plates that we used to grow the cells on or the bl21 cells are bad.
We are making new plates (Tristan) and I will run a test to see if a colony of the Bl21 cells grows in plain LB.
Redo of Transformation with pET+silk
We suspect there might be something wrong with the kanamycin plates we grew our colonies on, so today I will redo the transformation with the new plates.
Thaw cells (~80uL) on ice for 10 minutes.
Add 2uL of ligated product (diluted)
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Rescue in 320uL of SOC, incubate and shake for 1 hour.
Warm kanamycin plates at 37C.
Spin down bacteria to pellet, discard supernatant.
Add 110 uL of SOC, take 10uL and dilute 1:10.
Plate 100uL of bacteria (1:1 and 1:10) on each plate.
Spread with beads, incubate at 37C.
