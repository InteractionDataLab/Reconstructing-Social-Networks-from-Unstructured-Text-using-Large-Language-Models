ICA Oligo Characterization
The results from 6/3/2015 showed that C-cap could bind to MaSp2 CA.
We want to find out which sticky end the c-cap binds to.
If the C-sticky end is bound, then there should be no problem.
If the A-sticky end is bound, it could possibly interfere with ICA by competing with binding to MaSp2 AB.
We also decided to test the initiator and capping oligos again, but at a higher concentration.
We set up the following ligation reactions.
2 reactions each of BC+CA and CA+AB were set up using 50 ng of each fragment.
AB+Init and CA+Term were set up using 1 uL of 5 uM oligo in each.
Used T7 polymerase for all 6 reactions. Incubated for 10 minutes at 25 C.
After incubation, 1 uL of 5 uM working C-Cap was added to one BC+CA reaction and one CA+AB reaction each, and incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 C.
Results
Cast 2.5Â % TAE gel for visualization, used 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 The BC+CA reactions with or without C-cap show no double band character at the 200 bp mark. The CA+AB+C-cap reactions exhibits a double band similar to the CA+C-cap reaction from 6/3/2015 . AB+init exhibits a band at approximately 160 bp. CA+term exhibits a band at approximately 140 bp.
From these results, we can conclude that C-cap binds to the C-sticky end, and not the A-sticky end. We will be able to proceed with ICA as planned.
The initiator and terminator work as intended. The expected band sizes are 161 bp and 141 bp respectively.
All bands smaller than 100 bp correspond to unligated oligos.
In addition, there is a faint band at about 450 bp in the CA+AB reactions. We currently have no explanation for this, but the band size is similar to undigested MaSp2 that was amplified with VF/R primers.
