1 Post-Elution primer PCR of MaSp 2 plasmids
∙ Performed same PCR reaction as yesterday, but with 2x 50 uL for each reaction. This was prepared as a master mix. Results shown below.
Figure 1: Post-elution  amplification  of  MaSp  plasmids.  Results  are inconsistent even though a master mix was used.
∙ We excised the bands from 2AB, 2BC (only one), and 2CA.
