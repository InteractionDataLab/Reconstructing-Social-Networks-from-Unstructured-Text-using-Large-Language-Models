Miniprep
Used qiagen kit to prep M1-12(1C3)/(T7) and M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3)/(T7)
Sent 3 samples of each for sequencing (Fasih prepped)
ICA for M1-15
Used established protocol .
Put the M1-SeqAB2 in the fourth position (the second AB type monomer).

Visualized on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of M1-15 using post-elution primers. The expected size for the 15-mer is 1630 bp.
The indicated band was excised for extraction.
From a visual inspection, the yield is somewhat lower than that obtained for the 12-mers. This is probably due to reduced efficiency when using ICA to construct longer chains.
