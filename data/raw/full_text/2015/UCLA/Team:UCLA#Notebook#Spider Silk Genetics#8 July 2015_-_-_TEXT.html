Gel Purification of MaSp Seq AB and ICA 3-mer
Ran samples from 7/7/2015 on 1.5% TAE gel; used 2 uL 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Gel image of ICA 3-mer (expected 406 bp), and MaSp2 Seq AB (expected 170 bp)
Excised bands corresponding to the 3-mer, and 64 C MaSp2 Seq AB. There was no product present at the 61 C annealing for MaSp2 Seq AB.
Purified using Qiagen Kit.
MaSp2 Seq AB: 64.75 ng/uL, A: 2.33
ICA 3-mer: 38.21 ng/uL, A:2.29
Digestion of 3-mer, 6-mer, MaSp2 Seq AB
Digested 10 uL of each DNA species, regardless of concentration.
Digested in 50 uL reaction, using 1 uL each of EcoRI, PstI, using 10x NEBuffer 2.1.
Digestion conditions same as above section.
PCR purification
PCR purified using Zymo Clean and Concentrator -5, for pSB1C3 backbone, MaSp2 Seq AB, 3-mer, and 6-mer.
All of these were digested with EcoRI and PstI.

Electro-transformation of BBa_K525998
BBa_K525998 is a T7 promoter expression vector that is supplied with the registry kit. It is located in well 3M.
Reconstituted the DNA in 15 uL ddH2O.
Electro-transformed into cells.
Arc-time: 5.6 ms
Plated overnight.
Preparation of BL21(DE3)
Streaked overnight culture of BL21(DE3) cell onto LB plate for single colonies.
Plan to make chemically competent cells.
