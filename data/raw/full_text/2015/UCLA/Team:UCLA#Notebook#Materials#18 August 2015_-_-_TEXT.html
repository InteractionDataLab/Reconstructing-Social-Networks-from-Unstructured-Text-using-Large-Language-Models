MEASUREMENT STUDY
Started new dialysis on 2 silk samples (10 mL of LiBr silk, each)
START: 10:10 AM
Change 1: 11:10 AM
Change 2: 3:07 PM
Removed the silk from the concentration dialysis that was started yesterday at 900 AM
that is around 19 hrs, 20 minutes on the concentration
managed to only get around ~300 uL back from the cassette
4 mg in 20 uL = 200 mg/mL = 20g/100mL = 20% w/v.
I don't know how this managed to get so concentrated in less than 20 hrs.
I think concentration dialysis is to difficult and wasteful (20 hr dialysis to obtain less than 1 mL of silk)
going forward, HFIP is probably easier to work with
If we do do concentration, it will have to be for less than 19 hrs.
Prepared some Tamura dope (15% w/v, 500:1 silk:Tamura)

Spun at the rate recommended in the Lewis paper (1 mm/min plunger rate = 0.0167 mL/min for a plunger with diameter 4.78 mm)
70% v/v EtOH and water for coagulation bath
godet at rate of 187 steps/second
is not fast enough to keep the fiber taut from the PEEK tubing tip
the silk starts to droop
however, 2*187 is too fast, and breaks the fiber
at the end, we settled for godet rate of 187
at the end of the spin, the silk was allowed to soak in the bath for 1 hour, then taken out to dry in the fume hood
Resulting fiber was incredibly brittle
Dried fiber collected on the godet
We were unable to take it off the godet without breaking it
However, it glowed.
Fragments of the Tamura fiber are in the dish on the right. On the left is a tangle of natural silk, barely visible. Image was taken in a blue light box with a UV filter
Some observations about the spinning process:
It was extremely difficult for several reasons
the silk emerges from the PEEK tubing tip too quickly
emerging silk fiber is too difficult to see in the bath
very hard to grab and guide the silk to the godet
Silk breaks frequently from the godet. This is probably because we don't know exactly what godet speed to use
Silk slips off the bottom of the godet often
Current setup requires us to hover over the solvent bath as we guide the fiber
