For images, upload image onto wiki server. Then replace placeholder image url with your image's url.
Ordered lists for numbers
For tables, "tr" stands for "table row", and "td" means "table column."

mm/dd: Sample Entry
Today we began cloning our GFP.
PCR'd off template
Ran gel
Restriction digest
Ligated into backbone
For our ligation, we made the following modifications:
Tried it with newly bought ligase
Left reaction overnight instead of 2 hrs
Vector to insert ratio was 1:5 instead of 1:3
PCR Reaction:
