Introduction:  Today gel extraction and digestion of PCquad 3.0 will be done.  If permitting, ligation will also be done.
Procedures: Gel extraction was performed as indicated by zymo procedures.  The concentration was measured using the nanodrop.  78.78ng/uL.  260/280 = 3.23.
Since the yield was too low, another round of amplification will need to be done before digestion.
Conclusions:  There werenâ€™t any restriction enzymes available to use, so digestion will be done next week.  PCR amplification will be done in a larger volume for PCquad 3.0 as well.
Intro: Performed a 50 uL PCR amplification of Mutant #10. PCR cleanup.
50 uL PCR:
10 uL 5x Q5 buffer
5 uL 2mM dNTPs
2.5 uL 10 uM forward primer
2.5 uL 10 uM reverse primer
0.5 uL 1 ng/uL template DNA
0.5 uL Q5 Polymerase
29 uL ddH2O (to 50 uL)
This was mixed in a master tube and added to two different PCR tubes.
