Sequencing Results
M1-12(1C3)
1: wrong sequence entirely
2: wrong sequence entirely
3: wrong sequence entirely
Interestingly, all three sequences align to each other.
M1/2[1:1]-12(1C3)
1: Bad, single base pair mutation at ~550
2: GOOD
3: GOOD
M1/2[1:1]-12(T7)
1: Bad, deletion at ~80
2: GOOD
3: possibly correct, but not trustworthy due to short read.
M1/2[2:1]-12(1C3)
1: Bad, single bp mutation near ~660
2: Bad, single bp mutation at 962
3: GOOD
M1/2[2:1]-12(T7)
1: bad, non-silent single bp mutation at 1004
2: GOOD? silent single bp mutation at 702
3: GOOD? silent single bp mutation at 702
Miniprep for M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3)
Used qiagen kit to purify the two cultures.
Digestion Check for M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3)
Digest with X, P in preparation for possible subcloning.
Digest 3 ug of each DNA in a 50 uL reaction with 1 uL each of XbaI, PstI.
Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Visualize on 1% gel with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 X, P digest of putative M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3). The expected sized bands are 2070 and 1324, corresponding to the vector and the insert respectively. Neither colony has the correct sized band at 1324 bp.
Both colonies were wrong; did not send for sequencing.
BsaI Digestion of M1 Monomers
Digested 5 ug of plasmid DNA in a 50 uL reaction with 4 uL of BsaI. Digest 2x 50 uL reactions for each monomer.
Digest at 50 C for 2 hrs, heat at 65 C for 20 min.
Run of 1.5% TAE gel to visualize. Used 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder. (Should have used the 50 bp or 100 bp ladder instead)
Fig. 2 BsaI Digestion of M1 monomers. The expected size for digested monomer is 102 bp.
Olivia excised the gel for extraction.
