Transformation Results
All plates have colonies!
Starter Cultures Analysis
Starter cultures grown at 30 C are overgrown.
Cultures at 20 C show nothing.
Miniprep for M1-SeqAB2
Used qiagen kit to prep all 11 mL of culture.
419.90 ng/uL A: 1.88
BsaI Digestion for M1-SeqAB2
Digest in 2x 50 uL reactions 5 ug of plasmid using 4 uL of BsaI.
Digest at 50 C for 2 hrs, heat kill 65 C for 20 min.
Visualize on 1% TAE gel, with 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 BsaI digestion of M1-SeqAB2. The expected size is 102 bp.
Excised the 102 bp band, and extracted.
~25 ng/uL
Liquid Culture
Picked 3 colonies from each plate: M1-12(1C3)/(T7), M1/2[1:2]-12(1C3)/(T7) into 5 mL liquid culture with chloramphenicol.
Grew overnight at 37 C.
