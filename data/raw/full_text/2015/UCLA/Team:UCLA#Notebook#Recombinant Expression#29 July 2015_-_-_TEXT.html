BCA Assay for Protein Concentrations of the Tamura Batches
Fractions 1-Strip for the dual Tamura purifications were acetone precipitated and BCA Assay was conducted to determine concentration of samples before concentration.  Fresh BSA standards are additional precipitated for assaying purposes.
Protocol for BCA Protein Assay
1. Pipette 100 μl of each protein standard (including a blank) and sample into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes in triplicate.
2. Add 400 μl of cold (-20°C) acetone to each tube.
3. Vortex and incubate 30 minutes at -20°C.
4. Centrifuge 10 minutes at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge.
5. Pour off the supernatants and allow the acetone to evaporate from the tubes at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes.
Note: If two precipitations are necessary to remove the interfering substance, repeat Steps 2-5 before proceeding.
￼￼6. Add 100 μl of ultrapure water to the protein pellets and vortex.
7. Add 1 ml of BCA Working Solution (50 parts Reagent A and 1 part Reagent B) to each tube and vortex. Incubate 30 minutes at 37°C.
8. Cool samples to RT and measure absorbance at 562 nm.
9. Plot a standard curve based on absorbance of the protein standards and determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample according to the BCA Protein Assay Kit instructions.
21 samples - 21 mL of working solution.  25 mL of Reagent A and 0.5 mL of Reagent B.  Mix to combine.  Use immediately.
