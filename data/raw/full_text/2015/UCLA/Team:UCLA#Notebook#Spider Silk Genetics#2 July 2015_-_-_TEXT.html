PCR Amplification of 6-mer (no beads)
Used post elution primers to amplify the extracted 6-mer.
Will cycle test to determine optimal conditions.
Set up 2x 25 uL reactions, testing 17x and 20x cycles.
For template, used 100 uL of 1:100 dilution of the gel-extracted 6-mer (no beads). ~43 pg of template per reaction.

Results
Cast 1% TAE gel, used 2 uL of 100 bp ladder to visualize result.
Fig. 1 Post-elution amplification of 6-mer (no beads). The desired product is ~712 bp. There are unexpected bands at 400 and 100 bp. These are probably due to non-specific amplification
This PCR confirms that the 712 bp band is the desired 6 mer.
The presence of other amplification products may be due to contamination of template by 3-mers (406 bp size) or IT construct (100 bp size). May also be due to non-specific amplification.
We can try temperature testing in the future.
I also want to try PCR without the GC-enhancer.
Gel-Extraction
Excised the 712 band from above, and used qiagen kit to extract.
Got 17.9 ng/uL, A 260/280: 2.5
