Ligation Test using VF/R amplified Plasmids
Ligation using T7 Ligase. 50 ng each DNA in 15 uL reactions. The DNA was taken from yesterday's experiments.
We used the following protocol:

Reactions were incubated at 25 C for 10 minutes, then immediately run on gel.
Results
Cast 2% TAE agarose gel, used 2 uL NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 T7 Ligation test using VF/R amplified MaSp. Lane 1 is AB+BC, Lane 2 is BC+CA, Lane 3 is CA+AB. 204 bp band corresponds ligated product. The 102 bp band corresponds to unligated fragments. Compare to previous results from 5/12/2015 derived from plasmid.
These results indicate that both plasmid and PCR product digestion can be used for ICA work. Our next steps are to characterize other parts used in ICA.
Others
Ordered Initiator, Terminator and Caps with new sticky ends
