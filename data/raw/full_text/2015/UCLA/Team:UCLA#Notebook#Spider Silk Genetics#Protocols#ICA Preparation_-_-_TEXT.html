This page details solutions and reagents that should be prepared prior to beginning Iterative Capped Assembly.
Contents
1 Solutions
1.1 2x Binding and Wash (BW) Buffer
1.2 0.5x BW Buffer
1.3 ICA Elution Buffer
2 Initiator, Terminator, and Capping Oligo Preparation
Solutions
2x Binding and Wash (BW) Buffer
2 M NaCl
10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0
1 mM ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0
0.2% v/v Tween-20
For 50 mL of 2x BW Buffer:
5.844 g NaCl
500 uL of 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0
100 uL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0
100 uL Tween-20
Add ddH2O to 50 mL.
0.5x BW Buffer
Make a 1:4 dilution of 2x BW buffer in ddH2O
For 10 mL of 0.5x BW Buffer.
Dilute 2.5 mL of 2x BW Buffer to 10 mL.
ICA Elution Buffer
0.01% v/v Tween-20 in ddH2O
For 10 mL of Elution Buffer
1 uL Tween in 10 mL of ddH2O.
Initiator, Terminator, and Capping Oligo Preparation
Initiator and Terminator
Mix equal volumes of the two relevant ssDNA oligos at 100 uM each.
Heat at 95 C and ramp down to 25 C at 0.1 C/s.
After Heat treatment, prepare a 50 nM solution of the Initiator, and a 5 uM solution of the Terminator
Caps
Dilute Caps to 5 uM.
Heat at 95 C and ramp down to 25 C at 0.1 C/s.
