We are preparing to test the initiators, terminators and caps whenever they arrive.
VF/R amplification of MaSp 2AB, 2BC, 2CA
We followed the same protocol as on 5/27/2015 .

2BC (205 pg/uL)
2CA (219 pg/uL)

PCR Purification
Used Zymo DNA clean and concentrator-5 to purify the above PCR.
Split each 8-strip in two and purified separately, then eluted using the same 10 uL of ddH2O.

BsaI Digestion
Digested 1.5 ug of each PCR product from above in 50 uL with 4 uL of BsaI.
Same protocol as 5/28/2015 .

BC (379.4 ng/uL)

Results
Cast 250 mL of 1.8% TAE gel to visualize digestion results. We used 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 BsaI digestion of VF/R PCR products from earlier today (see above). The band at 102 bp corresponds to the digested product of interest.
It appears that digestion this time is more complete than previously .
We excised the 102 bp band for gel recovery tomorrow.
