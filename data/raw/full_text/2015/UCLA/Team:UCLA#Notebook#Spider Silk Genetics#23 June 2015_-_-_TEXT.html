Streptavidin Binding Test
Today we are testing if the streptavidin beads are binding properly to the biotinylated DNA.
Prepared 10 uL of magnetic beads with 1 uL of 5 uM initiator.
Incubated 35 min.
Washed 2x with 100 uL 0.5x BW buffer
Prepare contructs A-B and C-Term (C-T) separately,
Prepared each in 10 uL reactions with 0.5 uL T7 ligase.
Incubate each at 25 C for 10 minutes.
Combined A-B and C-T to form A-B-C-T
Incubate 25 C for 10 minutes.
Mix A-B-C-T onto the prepared beads.
Incubate at 25 C for 10 minutes with rotation.
Saved the supernatant, then added 1 uL of 5 uM initiator to it.
Incubate RT for 10 minutes.
After bead ligation, eluted using 0.01% Tween-20 at 95 C for 5 minutes with occasional mixing.
Ran 25 uL PCR using 1 uL of eluate as template.
same protocol as 6/19/2015 .
Saved all samples in -20 C.
