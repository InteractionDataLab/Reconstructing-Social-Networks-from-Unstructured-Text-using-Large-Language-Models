Figure 1: Scatterplot of Standards fitted with a Linear Regression Line.
The resulting linear fit equation (y = 0.0009x+ 0.1111) was used to estimate the protein concentration of the unknown wash and elution fractions of the previous purification, as well as the concentrate formed using the pooled fractions described above, centrifuged in the protein concentrator. This equation was calculated where x is the protein concentration, and y is the absorbance value emitted by the spectrophotometer.
