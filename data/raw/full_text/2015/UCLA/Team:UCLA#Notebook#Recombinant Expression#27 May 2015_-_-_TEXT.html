ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Inoculation of 10mL starter cultures.
3 starter cultures of 10mL Difco LB supplemented with 1x (50ug/uL concentration) ampicillin sodium.
Each culture was inoculated with single isolated colonies from the plates [ of glycerol stock from last Thursday ].
Tubes were labeled by the plates, which were labeled by the glycerol stocks (TGB3,4,5).  Tubes were shaking at 37 deg Celsius at 200 rpm starting at 1730 hours.  Will check on cultures at 0800 for OD600 at 0.4-0.8 for proper induction of 1L cultures.
Julians Work
I plated a culture from a glycerol stock. I then picked a colony and grew it up overnight in the 37C incubator in 5mL of LB.
