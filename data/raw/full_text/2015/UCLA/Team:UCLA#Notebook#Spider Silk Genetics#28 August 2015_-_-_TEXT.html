Gel Purification for M1 monomers
Used zymo kit, eluted in 12 uL of solution.
Yields were typical, around 25 ng/uL
Sequencing for M1, M2 monomers
Due to the presence of single bp mutations in the previous sequencing results , we wanted to check the sequence of the monomers to ensure that they are correct.
Sent each monomer sample for sequencing.
PCR Amplification for M1-12, M1/2[1:2]-12
3x 50 uL reactions for each. Used 1 uL of the ICA eluate as template.

Visualized on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of M1-12 and M1/2[1:2]-12. The expected size for both is 1324 bp. The bands corresponding to M1-12 are at a lower intensity that those of M1/2[1:2]-12. This is probably due to age of sample.
Excised the 1324 bp bands for extraction.
