PCR Amplifcation
Set up 17x 25 uL reactions for each species of MaSp.
Used 110 pg per 25 uL reaction

PCR Purification
We PCR purified using Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator -5.
Pooled 4x 50 uL reactions into one column.
Right before elution with ddH2O, noticed some precipitate in the columns. Probably salts. We avoided touching it as much as possible.

AB appears fine
The graph for BC was very messy, and there is probably error in the DNA concentration
CA appears okay, but with some messy graph peaks.
In the future, may want to use less template if this is a problem, and use fresh DNA and dNTPs
