Carter's run of the wet spin
Procedure
Pipette 2ml 20% wt/vol cellulose acetate into syringe reservoir while plugging the narrow opening
Insert plunger, Invert and depress plunger until cellulose acetate is almost through the narrow opening
Attach 27.5 gauge needle
Attach syringe to syringe pump, run into ethanol at 16 microliters/min
Observations
Thick fibers, possibly just coils,very blue, wait for ethanol to rid the acetate

Dialysis of Silk in Lithium Bromide
Cut 15 cm of dialysis tubing. Folded up bottom and clipped.
Filled tubing with 20-25 mL of the silk/LiBr solution.
Folded and clipped other end of tube and placed into 1L of ultrapure water.
Silk was heavy enough to weigh down dialysis clips, so a floating thing was used to keep the tubing up.
Wet Spinning Extrusion Practice
Placed 2mL of 20% w/v cellulose acetate in a syringe.
Attached syringe to syringe pump. Attached 27.5 gauge needle.
Positioned needle such that it descended vertically into a 70% ethanol solution.
Ran the syringe pump at a rate of 6 uL/min.
Fiber formation was not observed while the pump was running.
While the pump was off, fiber formation was observed. Occasionally, the fiber was extruded in a coiled structure.

Dialysis of 25 mL of silk
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since we're going over the volume recommended in the Kaplan paper, we'll likely need more water changes. Additionally, since we're using smaller pores than recommended in the Kaplan paper, we might need longer dialysis times in between changes.
start: 3:20 pm
1st change: 4:20 pm
2nd change: 3:50 pm, May 20
3rd change: 2:00 pm, May 21
4th change: 3:00 pm, May 24
5th change: 4:00 pm, May 26
6th change: 1:00 pm, May 27
7th change: 5:00 pm, May 28
Plan for the next few days:
we'll be concentrating and spinning silk.
Fixed factors:
PEEK tubing, 10 mm in length
stretch fibers by hand, 5x
Dope concentration of 15%. Aqueous.
Variable: coagulation dope
Ammonium sulfate
isopropanol
ethanol
Wednesday: start PEG dialysis at 4:00 PM
Thursday: stop PEG dialysis at 2:00 PM (22 hours)
aliquot 100 uL and place at 60 C to determine concentration
Dilute down to 15%
start spinning
