Honeybee Parts
BBa_K1763000 This part is the coding region of honeybee silk protein #3. For the sequence click here . Click on the link for more details on how the sequence was designed and chosen, as well as how the cloning was carried out.
BBa_K1763001 This part is a composite part of the honeybee silk protein #3 coding region along with BBa_R0010 Promoter and RBS BBa_B0034 . For the sequence click here . Click HERE for more details on how the sequence was designed and chosen, as well as how the cloning was carried out.
BBa_K1763008 .  This sequence is a fusion protein between our honeybee silk and the Spycatcher, protein which has specific affinity for SpyCatcher. It also contains regulatory elements like a promoter and rbs for expression.
BBa_K1763007 is our honeybee silk sequence with a T7 promoter upstream for effective protein expression in bacterial strains containing t7 polymerase.
BBa_K1763015 is our honeybee silk sequence+sfGFP with a T7 promoter and RBS upstream that can be used in bacterial strains that contain T7 polymerase.
