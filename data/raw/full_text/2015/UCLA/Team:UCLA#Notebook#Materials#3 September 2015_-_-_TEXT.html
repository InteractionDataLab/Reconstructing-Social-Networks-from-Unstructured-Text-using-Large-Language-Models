Trying a new HFIP Spin
57 mg of lyophilized silk in 228 uL of HFIP
we are melting it inside of the syringe body
Dialyzing the LiBr silk
dialysis start: 11:30AM
change 1: 12:30PM
Trying Honeybee Silk Spin
unknown concentration
10 uL/min
Tried a variety of coagulation baths
100% Methanol
90% Methanol
80% Methanol
70% Methanol
100% water
100% Isopropanol
70% Isopropanol
Note: The silk gels up in the syringe barrel at room temperature.
This silk behaves very strangely
You see those "ghost" wisps that look like solvent
But occasionally, an opaque thread will come out at very high speed
It looks like the gel in the barrel
It will travel down into the beaker, then disintegrate
At higher alcohol concentrations, the "thread" does appear to coagulate and bunch up near the tip (as the literature says it would)
I think that the dope is too dilute.
But also, the fact that it's gelling in the barrel is disconcerting.
