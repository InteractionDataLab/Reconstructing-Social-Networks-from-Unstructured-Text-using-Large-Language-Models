Colony PCR for M1-15(T7)
Picked 16 colonies, resuspended each colony in 50 uL LB.
Used 1 uL of resuspended colony as template in PCR using Taq Red Master Mix.

Visualize on 1% TAE gel, with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Colony PCR for M1-15(T7). The expected band size is approximately 1.9 kb. There are only 2 colonies that might possibly have the correct sequence. Colonies 6 and 12.
Inoculated 5 mL of LB + chlor with 25 uL of resuspended colony 6, 12 for sequencing tomorrow.
