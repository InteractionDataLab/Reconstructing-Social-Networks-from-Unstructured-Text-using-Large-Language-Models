Transformation Results
MaSp2 3-, 6-mer in BBa_k525998 in BL21 cells have many colonies on the plate.
May have plated too much. Will reduce plating density in the future when working with the BL21(DE3) chemical competent cells.
9-mer in pSB1C3 has very few small colonies.
MaSp2 ICA 12-mer
Plan to do 12 mer today: 100 uL wases, 5 min ligation time.
1 ul of 50 nM initiator used. Initial binding in 45 minutes.
5 minute ligation times for each step.
50 ng of each DNA species
1 uL of 5 uM solution of each relevant cap.
eluted in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20 solution
PCR amplification for MASp2 ICA 12-mer
Used the following protocol to set up 2x 25 uL reactions.
Used crude eluate from ICA as template.
Amplified with post-elution primers

Results
Cast 1.5% TAE gel to visualize results; used 2 uL of NEB 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR Amplification of MaSp2 ICA 12-mer using post-elution primers. Both lanes are identical conditions. The expected product is 1324 bp. This is the major band present. Slight accessory bands are also present, but are a minor product.
We were able to successfully perform ICA to obtain a 12-mer. The accessory bands present may be due to PCR non-specific amplification, or to inaccuracies in the ICA process.
We excised the 1324 bp band for gel-extraction in preparation for cloning.
Liquid Culture for MaSp2 3-mer, 6-mer, 9-mer
Grew 3x 5 mL culture for MaSp2 3-mer(T7), MaSp2 6-mer(T7), and 9-mer(pSB1C3).
Plan to miniprep tomorrow then sequence over the weekend.
Will have bacterial cultures ready on Monday for the protein expression team to use.
