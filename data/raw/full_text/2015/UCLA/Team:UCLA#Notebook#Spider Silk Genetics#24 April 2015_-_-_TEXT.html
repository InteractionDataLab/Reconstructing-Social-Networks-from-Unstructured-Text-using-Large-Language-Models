1 Sequencing of MaSp2 constructs
∙ Prepared each sample from yesterday for sequencing.
∙ Diluted 500 ng of each DNA species and 2.5 uL of VF2 primer into 15 uL in a PCR strip.
2 Results: 4/25/2015
∙ Used Clustal W2 to align sequencing results.
∙ Constructs 2AB-2, 2BC-1, and 2CA-2 are sequenced properly.
