Sequencing Results
The sequencing results from psb1c3+T7 promoter+silk+GFP came back, the first sample looked very clean with the exception of a noisy middle region (inaccurate sequencing after 500-700 bp). The other two samples had more mutations. I will be designing a primer to sequence the middle region.
