1 PCR Amplification of MaSp Plasmids
∙ Set up four 25 uL PCR reactions to test amplification. Used two pairs of primers and two different cycling conditions.
∙ Used MaSp2 2CA as template. Diluted 1:1000 to get 219 pg/uL. Created 2 master-mixes, one with each primer pair.
∙ Tested VF2/VR primers and post-elution primers using 17 cycles and 15 cycles using protocol below:

∙ We used 66 C as annealing because that temperature worked for previous amplification with the post-elution primers. In addition, NEB Tm calculator indicates 66 C annealing for the VF2/VR primer pair.
2 Results
∙ Cast 2% TAE gel to visualize results. Used 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Figure 1: P/E  indicates  reactions  with  post-elution  primer  pair.  VF/R indicates reactions with VF2 and VR primers. The VF/R primers successfully amplify with a clean band. P/E does not appear to amplify. Primer dimers are present in all lanes. Imaged by Danny. Don’t know why the image is orange.
Figure 2: P/E  indicates  reactions  with  post-elution  primer  pair.  VF/R indicates reactions with VF2 and VR primers. The VF/R primers successfully amplify with a clean band. P/E does not appear to amplify. Primer dimers are present in all lanes. This image taken several hours after previous image. Some band smearing is present.
∙ The VF/R primer pair amplifies our plasmid as expected, but the post-elution primers do not. The expected size for VF/R amplification is 443 bp.
∙ May be due to bad primers for post-elution. Re-order or remake? We need to find more of the post-elution primers.
