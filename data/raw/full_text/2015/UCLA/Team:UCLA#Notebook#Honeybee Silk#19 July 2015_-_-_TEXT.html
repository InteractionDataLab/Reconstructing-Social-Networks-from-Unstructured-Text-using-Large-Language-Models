Lots of Colony PCR's
Ran Colony PCR's of both silk in T7 promoter biobrick, as well as silk in pet vector in BL21 cells.
The results from both looked weird, but there was at least a faint band at the right size.
We inoculated the 8 colonies from the t7 biobrick and also 6 colonies from the silk in bl21. (chlor and kan resistance respectively.)
Put tubes in at 7 pm 7/19 37 C
