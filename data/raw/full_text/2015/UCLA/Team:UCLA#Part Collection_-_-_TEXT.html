Our best parts collection consists of BBa_K1763002, BBa_K1763003, BBa_K1763004, BBa_K1763009, BBa_K1763010, BBa_K1763011, BBa_K1763012, and BBa_K1763423. This part collection is designed to allow all teams with this part collection to conduct ICA to rapidly and controllably assemble repetitive spider silk gene constructs.  All parts necessary for MaSp1/2 ligation and sequencing are located in this collection, and will allow any team to perform ICA without resorting to gBlocks synthesis or cloning manipulation of the monomeric parts.  We have generated excellent documentation for teams to use this set, not only from our wiki project page and parts page, but in a cloning guide found in our collaborations page with TU Eindhoven containing detailed troubleshooting and FAQs, which teams can use to completely conduct ICA on spider silk genes.  This collection has shown to be completely functional to design a wide variety of genes in terms of length and MaSP1/2 ratios, as indicated by our project page.
