Lane 3-6: M1-9(T7) Colony 1-4. Lane 7-10: M1SeqAB1 Colony 1-4. Lane 11-14: M1SeqAB2 Colony 1-4
Grew liquid culture for
all 4 colonies of M1-9 (T7); they all showed band close to the expected size ~1200-1300bp but they are slightly different so decided to sequence all of them.
colonies 1-3 for M1SeqAB1
none for M1SeqAB2 since we probably do not need this seq construct
