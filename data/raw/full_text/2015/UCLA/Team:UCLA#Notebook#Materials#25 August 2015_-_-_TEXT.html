Instron Data for Tamura (From July 14 's spin)
Note: all of these should have a gauge length of 10 mm. For cross sectional area, use what we obtained in previous microscopy
sample
extension rate
notes
Tamu 2
1 mm/min
broke while being loaded. Unusable data
Tamu 3
1 mm/min
broke literally at the beginning of the test. Too brittle. Unusable data
Tamu 4
0.001 mm/min
Extension rate was dropped to 0.01 mm/min because the fibers were breaking too easily. Data is being weird. 0.01 mm/min is too slow to be continuous, so the data is more or less discrete. Will need to average each data point before analyzing. Additionally, the fiber has a permanent kink in it.
Holy crap 0.001 mm/min took over 2.5 hrs and still didn't break. I bumped it up to 0.01 mm/min to get it going faster.
I then bumped it up to 0.1 mm/min
0.001 mm/min takes literally over an hour. Would recommend 0.1 mm/min.
