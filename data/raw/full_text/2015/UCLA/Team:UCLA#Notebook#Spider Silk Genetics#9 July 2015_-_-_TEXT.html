Ligation for 3-, 6- mer, and MaSp2 Seq AB
Used the pieces that were digested yesterday .
Used ligation calculator to determine proper amounts of insert and vector.
Vector size: 2200 bp
Vector amount: 50 ng
3:1 insert to vector ratio
Insert size:
3-mer: 406 bp -> 27.68 ng
6-mer: 712 bp -> 48.55 ng
MaSp2 Seq AB: 170 bp -> 11.59 ng

Small Scale Liquid Culture for BBa_525998 and BL21(DE3)
set up 6 ml cultures for BBa_525998 and BL21(DE3) with chloramphenicol for BBa_525998 and no selection for BL21(DE3).
3 cultures for BBa_525998, plan to miniprep and sequence verify.
1 culture for BL21(DE3), plan to make chemically competent cells.
Drop Dialysis
Performed drop dialysis of 2 uL of ligation reactions against ultra-pure water for 10 minutes to remove salts in preparation for electro-transformation.
Three drops on same membrane.
Electro-Transformation
Electro-transformed the 3-mer, 6-mer, and MaSp2 Seq AB from the drop dialysis. Pulse times listed below.
3-mer: 5.5 ms
6-mer: 5.5 ms
MaSp2 Seq AB: 5.5 ms
Plated all three onto chloramphenicol plates.
