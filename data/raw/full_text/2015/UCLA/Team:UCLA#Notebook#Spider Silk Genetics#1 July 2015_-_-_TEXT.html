Initiator Binding Test
Test initiator binding only.
Bind, then elute, then analyze on e-gel.
Test four conditions:
Init only
Init + beads, then elute
Init + A + B
Init + term.
1 uL of 5 uM initiator used, 1 uL of 5 uM terminator.
50 ng of each other fragments.
The same protocol as 6/19/2015 was used, with the following modifications.
initial binding time was increased to 45 minutes.
Washes were performed using 100 uL of solution.
Results
After elution, we visualized the constructs on 1% e-gel.
Nothing showed up on the gel, although we expect the initiator in condition 1 to appear.
Possibly due to mistakes made during sample preparation.
BsaI Digestion
Set up 2x 50 uL reactions for each MaSp monomer.
Digested ~5 ug of each MaSp plasmid using 4 uL of BsaI.
Incubated 2 hours at 50 C, then heat for 20 minutes at 65 C.
Visualized results on 1.5% gel, using 2 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 BsaI digestion of MaSp plasmids. The desired product is 102 bp in size.
We excised the bands for purification tomorrow.
MaSp 2 6-mer ligation
Tested 6-mer creation without use of beads.
Experimentally create: IAB--CA--BCT, then pool all three sub-constructs together.
Each sub-construct was ligated for 10 minutes at 25 C, then all three were pooled together, then incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 C.

Results
Ran the ligation product on 1% TAE gel, using 2 uL 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 2 Ligation of MaSp2 6-mer. The expected product for a 6-mer ligation is ~712 bp. There are other bands present that may be due to other possible ligation events.
We successfully created a 6-mer ligation product without beads, although the results is far from efficient due to the presence of a number of bands that correspond to other ligation events.
We excised the 712 bp band for gel extraction tomorrow.
We plan to PCR amplify the 6-mer and ligate it into pSB1C3.
This result indicates that successive ligation can only be perfomed twice, as ligation efficiency decreases dramatically. This means that for creating larger MaSp constructs such as 12- or 15-mers, we would need successive ligation and purification steps to achieve efficient construction.
