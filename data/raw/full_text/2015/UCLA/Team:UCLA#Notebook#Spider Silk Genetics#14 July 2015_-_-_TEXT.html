ICA for 9-mer Again
We decided to try ICA for 9-mer again, with modification of using more terminator.
Use 1 ul of 5 uM terminator, rather than 1 uL of 50 nM terminator (100-fold increase)
Also increased volume of washes from 50 uL to 100 uL.
Incubation times for ligation steps were reduced to 5 minutes.
Performed ICA using 50 ng of each DNA species, and 1 uL of 5 uM of the relevant cap.
Eluted in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20.
PCR for ICA 9-mer Amplification
PCR amplified using eluate as template
Used 0.5 uL of undiluted and 1:100 dilution.
NO GC enhancer
Tested annealing temperature.

Results
Cast 1.5% TAE gel to visualize results. Used 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of ICA 9-mer. This time, the results are much cleaner than the one from 7/13/2015 . The anticipated product corresponding to a successful 9-mer is 1018 bp.
It seems that we are able to get ICA to work properly.
While the accessory bands are still present to some degree, the major product is our desired 9-mer.
We still do not know if the accessory bands are an artifact of PCR or ICA.
It seems that a 1:100 dilution of the crude eluate does not provide sufficient template for amplification.
Gel Purification
The bands corresponding to the 9-mer were excised, then gel extracted using qiagen kit.
Yielded ~ 50 ng/uL in 10 uL.
