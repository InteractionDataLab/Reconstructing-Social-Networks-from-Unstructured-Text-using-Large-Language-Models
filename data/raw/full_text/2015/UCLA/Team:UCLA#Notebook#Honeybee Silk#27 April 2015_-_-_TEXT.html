4/27 visualization and purification of honeybee gblock PCR
We visualized the gradient pcr from 4/26 on a 1% agarose gel. See image below:
The PCR for both constructs (silk coding region) and (regulatory elements + silk coding region) worked relatively well across all gradient temperatures.
We next scaled up the PCR reaction to 50 ul for each construct and gel extracted the product
From left to right, just silk w/ bb prefix and suffix w/ increasing annealing temp. , ladder, followed by silk+ promoter at increasing temp (see 4/26 for pcr conditions)
