VF/R Amplification of MaSp 2CA Temperature Test
Setup
Due to lower yield of previous reactions, we decided to test lower temperatures which may give a higher yield.
We tested amplification at 63 C, 60 C and 57 C in 25 uL reactions using the following protocol.

The reactions were prepared as a mastermix without the addition of polymerase. Reactions were split, then polymerase added indivdually.
Results
Cast 150 mL of 1.5% TAE agarose gel. Used 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Temperature test amplification of MaSp 2CA. The expected product has a size of 443 bp.
The intensity of the bands at each temperature are approximately equal.
For this test, we used primers reconstituted from stock. Compared to previous amplifications ( 5/19/2015 and 5/20/2015 ) the yield of amplification is improved. The old primers were probably degraded.
There is a smear around 50 bp which may be leftover primers.
We will use 63 C as annealing for future amplifications.
Large Scale Amplification of MaSp 2AB, 2BC, 2CA using VF/R
Setup
Based on results above, we set up 8x 50 uL reactions for each MaSp construct using the following protocol.

2BC (205 pg/uL)
2CA (219 pg/uL)

The protocol is written for 8.1x 50 uL reactions to give leeway in making master mix.
There is 110 pg of template for 25 uL of reaction, which equates 220 pg in each 50 uL reaction.
Results
PCR purified the products using Zymo Clean and Concentrator -5 Kit.
Pooled 4x 50 uL reactions into one column, then eluted both columns using the same water each time.
Eluted in 11 uL ddH2O.
