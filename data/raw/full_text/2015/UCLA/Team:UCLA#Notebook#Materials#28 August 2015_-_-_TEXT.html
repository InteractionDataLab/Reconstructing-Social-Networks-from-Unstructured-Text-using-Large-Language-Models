Dialyzing Recombinant MASP2
5 mM ammonium bicarbonate. 1L of it. 24 hour dialysis, with 2 bath changes.
Dialyze 4 mL each of fractions 3,4,5 (total 12 mL)
5 mM = 0.3953g in 1L of water
Dialysis start: 5pm
Bath change: 11:30pm
Imitating the DACA Spinline
Folded an aluminum tray to hold the coag bath for the 2 godets
Used a ringstand to hold a hook above the coagulation bath
Extruded dope into a 1L beaker of 90% v/v isopropanol
It didn't work!
The hook had too much friction, so the fiber wasn't able to slide over it. I wasn't even able to get the fiber to the first godet.
I also found that with the isopropanol bath, if you disturb the dope even slightly as it comes out, it starts bunching up. It's very sensitive.
Switching back to yesterday's spin method
Clearly the imitation DACA wasn't working. So I just set up a godet to reel the silk above the coag bath again.
However, immediately after spinning, I submerged the godet in the coag. solvent and removed the silk from the godet. I then used tweezers to try to stretch the ring of fiber that formed
My attempts at stretching probably broke fibers instead of stretching them.
