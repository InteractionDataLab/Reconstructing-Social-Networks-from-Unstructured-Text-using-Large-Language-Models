Sequencing Results
M1-AB
All three good.
M1-BC
All three good.
M1-CA
All three good.
M2-12(1C3)
1: No insert
2: No insert
3: Gibberish (does not align to anything)
Unfortunately, no correct sequences for M2-12(1C3)
Maybe re-transform using first ligation product.
PCR Amplification for M-12
Amplify using post-elution primers in 1x 50 uL reaction.

After PCR, sample was split into two equal volumes for gel purification.
Verified on 1% TAE gel, with 2 uL of NEB 1kb ladder. (Fasih loaded this gel, and was somewhat rough with it.).
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of ICA M2-15mer. The expected size for M2-15 is 1630 bp. The two lanes marked M2-15 are identical samples. The two unmarked lanes have no sample in them.
Not a lot of yield this time. May need to PCR more in the future.
The 1630 bp band was excised, and gel purified using Qiagen kit.
Colony PCR for M2-12(1C3)
Picked eight colonies from the plate of M2-12(1C3) retrieved 7/22/2015 .
Suspended colony in 15 uL LB.
Streaked pipet tip after resuspension on an LB-Chloramphenicol index plate.

Negative control colony PCR: instead of colony, used 1 uL of plain LB.
Results
Visualized colony PCR on 1% TAE gel, using 3 uL of NEB 1kb ladder.
Fig. 2 Colony PCR of M2-12(1C3) The expected size is approx 1.6 kb, since this was amplified using VF/R. None of the bands are close to 1.6 kb.
Colony PCR indicates that all of the colonies we tested do not have the desired insert. This is likely symptomatic of the entire plate.
We will abandon this plate of bacteria, since it most likely does not contain any usable colonies.
