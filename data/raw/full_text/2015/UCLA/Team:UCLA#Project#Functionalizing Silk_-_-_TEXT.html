Silk Functionalization: Developing the Next Generation of High Performance Fibers
Background
Abstract
Silk fibers possess the potential to be transformed into functional biomaterials that can be exploited in an array of biomedical applications, from aiding nanoscale drug delivery to simulating medical sutures. However, traditional methods of incorporating functional domains into fibers involve difficult, costly, and time-consuming processes. We propose an in vitro, co-spinning method to quickly and efficiently functionalize silk fibers. In essence, we spin a mixture of wild-type silk dope spiked with a small volume of functional domain. This functional domain which will bind to the native silk proteins when co-spun, thereby incorporating itself into the final synthetic fiber. To ensure proper binding of our functional domain, we created a co-spinning module. This module is a genetic construct consisting of our gene of interest flanked on either side by the N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori (silkworm silk). When co-spun, the termini on our synthetic protein will bind to the respective termini in the native silk proteins, thereby functionalizing the fiber. Our goal is to develop, optimize and experimentally validate our co-spinning module, and assess its potential as a scalable and powerful tool to manufacture silk fibers with an array of functional capacities.

Introduction
Native silk fibers exhibit great tensile strength, elasticity, and flexibility. These mechanical properties, coupled with the non-immunogenic behavior of silk proteins, render silk fibers a worthy candidate in the realm of biomedical applications. Due to the potential of these fibers as a vehicle for nanoscale drug delivery or a scaffold for tissue engineering, there is much interest in attaching domains onto these fibers to achieve desired functionality. Bombyx mori, commonly known as silkworm, contain silk proteins comprised of fibroin, the core fiber that provides silkworm silk it’s structure. Fibroin is the main protein of interest that we aim to attach functional domains onto. Fibroin serves as a vehicle for functionality.
Previously, to functionalize fibroin proteins, scientists have relied on chemical conjugation of silk peptides or breeding transfected silkworms that express transgenes encoding functional domains. However, these methods have inherent limitations. Attaching big, bulky functional domains directly onto the ends of fibroin proteins can disrupt Beta-sheet formation between the fibers. Preserving secondary structure is critical to preserve functionality. Moreover, native Bombyx mori silk genes are incredibly repetitive, which makes cloning of transgenes complex and time consuming. The breeding of transfected silkworms can be summed up as costly and laborious. These disadvantages prevent chemical conjugation and in vivo expression from becoming  sustainable, cost-efficient ways of manufacturing silk fibers with functional capacities. As a result, there is much need to develop a new method to manufacture functional fibers.
Methodology
Fig 1: Our novel, co-spinning module, with our gene of interest, sfGFP, inserted between the non-repetitive N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori, along with appropriate Bsa1 restriction sites. Also not shown is a 6X histidine tag, used for later protein purification processes.
The theory behind the co-spinning methodology is to attach a functional domain onto the native silk fiber without disrupting the natural mechanical properties or non-immunogenic behavior of wild-type silk. To achieve this, we've created a genetic construct, entitled our "co-spinning module", consisting of super folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP) flanked on either sides by the N and C terminal domains of Bombyx mori. These termini are critical in maintaining the structural integrity of the fibers. Specifically, the N terminal domains of individual fibroin proteins bind to their identical counterparts on adjacent fibroin proteins, thereby establishing disulfide linkages between the fibers. The C terminal domains on the fibroin proteins aid the fibers in responding to decreases in pH levels and mechanical stresses, conditions that induce the stacking of Beta sheets into an actual fiber. The repetitive motifs in between the terminal domains are hydrophobic regions that cluster together, separate from the hydrophilic N terminal domains, thus simulating a micelle. From our co-spinning module, we create a synthetic protein that emulates the composition of native fibroin, with the repetitive motifs between the domains replaced with our functional domain, sfGFP. When co-spun, the N terminal domains on our synthetic protein will recognize and bind to their counterparts on the native fibroin proteins, maintaining the micellar structure. The repetitive regions on the native fibroin and the sfGFP on our synthetic protein are coiled structures that, when exposed to the mechanical stresses induced by in vitro syringe extrusion, will flatten and stack up into Beta sheets, and Beta sheet formation is the key indication of proper fiber formation.

Fig 3: In our co-spinning methodology, Bombyx mori silk dope is spiked with a small volume (3 ul) of functional domain. The N termini on our expressed co-spinning module protein bind to the N-termini in the wildtype silk fibroin, and these hydrophilic heads arrange in a micellar structure, isolating the dangling coils of repetitive regions and sfGFP. After in-vitro syringe extrusion, the sheer forces applied induces Beta sheet formation.

Future Directions
Now that we have established a proof of concept with sfGFP, you can imagine how we can swap sfGFP with other functional domains to spin out synthetic fibers that exhibit an array of functionality! In order to verify this BioBrick as a screening platform to assay for functional peptide affinity, a wide variety of co-spinning modules must be constructed.  Namely, co-spinning modules digested and ligated with albumin-binding domain (ABD), immunoglobin G binding domain (ImGBD) and avidin binding domains (AvBD) may be of critical use in both experimental design and developing a functional application of co-spinning in a wide variety of biomedical applications.
