1.1 Miniprep for M1-15(1C3)/(T7) and Tamura(1C3)
1.2 Restriction Digest Test
1.3 Colony PCR for M1-15(T7)

Miniprep for M1-15(1C3)/(T7) and Tamura(1C3)
Used qiagen kit.
Elute in 30 uL.
Restriction Digest Test
Digest with X,P to see insert size.
Digest 1 ug of plasmid in a 50 uL reaction with 1 uL of each enzyme.
Digest at 37 C for 1 hr 15 min, heat kill at 80 C for 15 min.
Visualize on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 X,P digest of M1-15(1C3), M1-15(T7), and Tamura(1C3) samples prior to sequencing. The expected insert size for all three constructs are 1.6 kb. None of the M1-15 colonies have the right insert. Both Tamura(1C3) colonies have the correct sized insert.
M1-15 colonies are wrong; don't send for sequencing.
Send Tamura(1C3) for sequencing with VF, VR primers.
Also send old Tamura(1A3) for sequencing as well.
Colony PCR for M1-15(T7)
Since no colonies are left on M1-15(1C3), will focus on M1-15(T7).
Picked 8 colonies from M1-15(T7) plate, resuspended in 50 uL LB.
Colony PCR with 1 uL of resuspended colony as template.

Visualize colony PCR results on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 2 Colony PCR of M1-15(T7) using VF/R. The expected band size is 1.9 kb.
Colony PCR shows that the 8 colonies picked are incorrect. Will pick more.
