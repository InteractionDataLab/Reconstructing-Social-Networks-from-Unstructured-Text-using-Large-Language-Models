PCR for ICA on M-270 Beads
Using solution saved over from yesterday , performed PCR to assess ICA.
Used two different concentrations of template due to low nanodrop reading.
Nanodrop indicated 4.12 ng/uL.
Set up 2x 25 uL PCR reactions, used post-elution primers to amplify.

Results
Visualize results on 1% e-gel, using 0.5 uL 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 E-gel of post-elution primer amplification of ICA on M-270 beads. The expected size of the desired product is ~406 bp. In addition to the expected bands, there are bands present at ~100 bp and at ~750 bp.
This indicates that we are able to get ICA working using M-270 beads. It seems that the problem we had previously was due to using streptavidin magnabind beads, which may be incompatible, or degraded.
The bands at 100 bp are most likely due to the amplification of the IT construct, may be reduced in the future by using less initiator, compared to the 1 uL of 5 uM initiator used for this experiment.
The bands above 400 bp may be due to over-amplification, and can be eliminated through optimizing the PCR.
PCA of MaSp2 Sequencing Core
We are adding the extension primers to the MaSp2 Sequencing Core.
The core is at a concentration of 13.04 ng/uL
We are using a 1:1000 dilution of the sequencing core as template: 13 pg/uL
We only need to make MaSp2 Seq AB.
NEB Tm Calculator gives 62 C as annealing temperature based on the overlap region. We decide to test 61 C and 64 C.
