4/30 Double digest of Honeybee PCR product and ligation into PSB1C3 plasmid backbone
Vinson and Olivia already prepared ecor1 and pst1 digested psb1c3, (35 ng/ul in honeybee box) which I will be using for ligation. It is column purified as well. I am double digesting both the plain silk construct, as well as the promoter+silk construct with ecoR1 and pst1.

Ligation Reaction into PSB1c3 vector
20 ul ligation reaction according to protocol using T4 ligase
2 reactions, (1 for silk, 1 for promoter + silk)  Both are at a 3:1 molar insert:vector ratio.
