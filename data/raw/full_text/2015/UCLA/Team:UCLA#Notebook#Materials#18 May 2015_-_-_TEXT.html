ENTREPRENEURSHIP
centrifuged the silk that had been dialyzing
some notes for using the Kosuri lab centrifuge:
it fits either 2 15 mL tubes, or more 50 mL tubes
make sure all tubes are balanced to at least 10 mg!
use the adapters if using 15 mL tubes in the centrifuge
pipetted 500 uL of silk to determine concentration
ended up with 0.026 grams dry
that's 5.2% w/v
brainstorming for spinning silk
Factors that we can test:
Solvents
Water
HFIP
Formic acid
TFA
Coagulation bath
isopropanol
ethanol
methanol
ammonium sulfate
Diameter
PEEK tubing (0.0005 inch diameter)
hypodermic needles (multiple gauges)
length of the PEEK tubing
Draw rates
anywhere from 2x to 6x (maybe more?)
Dope concentration
literature says 13%-19%, optimal is 15%
our immediate experiment to try out:
water as solvent. isopropanol for coagulation. PEEK tubing, 10 mm. 15% w/w dope concentration. Draw ratio of 5x by hand.
