Running Tests on Purified Honeybee Protein
As per Michael's suggestion I am running a Dry Film Test in order to determine the weight by volume percent of silk protein in our samples.
Tristan is running a BCA assay with Jessica on the samples from 5/26 and 7/29.
Dry Film Test
Weighed out 100 ul of 5/26, 7/29 and a 3% SDS solution as a control.
3%SDS = 0.0991 g, 5/26 silk = 0.1001 g, 7/29 silk = 0.0940 g
Need to keep in mind that the 5/26 ad 7/29 silks are not directly comparable, because one was solubilized in 750 ul of 3% SDS and the 5/26 was solubilized in 2 ml of 3% SDS, and the 5/26 was from a 250 ml culture, and the 7/29 was from a 100 ml bacterial culture.
BCA
Using a Thermo Kit, Jessica prepared 9 standards.
I made a working reagent of 25ml reagent A mixed with 0.5ml reagent B by inverting.
100ul of each standard, sample, and blank was added to microcentrifuge tubes.
1ml of the working reagent was added to each tube, except the blank, and vortexed for 10s.
All tubes were incubated at 37C for 45min.
All samples were transferred to cuvets and run in a spectrophotometer.
