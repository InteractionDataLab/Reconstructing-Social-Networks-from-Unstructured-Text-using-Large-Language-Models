Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, DLS will be done on the purified PCquadY from last week.  The elutions will be pooled before bringing it to Kevin.
Procedure: The first two elutions from the experiment visibly contained a white precipitate, which is likely the protein cage.  These tubes were pooled and centrifuged.  The pellet was re-suspended in 150uL of triton lysis buffer.
Results:  The supernatant sample and the re-suspended pellet were both ran.  Both did not provide a baseline reading.
Conclusion:  Since aggregation seems to be a problem, the DLS may have to be ran soon after purification.
