1 Polymerase Chain Assembly of MaSp 2AB sequence.
Repeated PCA of 2AB using protocol from 4/13/2015 with the follow modifications.
∙ Annealing Temp: 64 C
∙ 25 cycles instead of 20.
∙ We cast a 1.5% gel to visualize the results shown below.
Figure 1: PCA of MaSp 2AB. Our target product is at 170 bp.
2 Gel Extraction
Fasih gel extracted the two 2AB bands.
