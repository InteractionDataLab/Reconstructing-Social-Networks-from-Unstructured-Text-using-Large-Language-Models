Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  The PCquad Yeates will be grown again in order to rerun the purification and a purer product will be attempted to be obtained.  For today, the glycerol stock will be used to streak on a plate.  In addition, sequencing primers will be designed.
The previous sequencing primers look like they should work for PCquad prime 3.0 and Mutant 10, so no primers were made.
Streaking the plate:
The glycerol stocks were obtained and put on ice.  The ampicillin plate was obtained and warmed in the incubator for 15 minutes.  Using asceptic technique, a wire loop was flamed, and cooled on the gel.  It was then dipped into the glycerol stock, and then plated in a zig-zag fashion.  The wire loop was flamed and cooled again before running another zig-zag pattern across the end of the previous streak.  This was done a total of three times.  The plate was then put in the 37C incubator at 5:30PM.
