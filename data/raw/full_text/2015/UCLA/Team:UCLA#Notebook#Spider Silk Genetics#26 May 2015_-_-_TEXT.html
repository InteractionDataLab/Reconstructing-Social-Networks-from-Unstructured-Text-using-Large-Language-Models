1. BsaI Digestion for VF/R amplified MaSp2 2CA
Used all of the DNA from last Friday .
We set up the digestion according to the following protocol.

2. Results
We cast a 2% TAE gel to visualize results. We used 2 uL of NEB 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Results of BsaI digestion of VF/R amplified MaSp2 2CA. Digestion of the fragment is mostly complete (compare to previously) . The faint band smear at 443 bp corresponds to undigested fragments. The bands at 150 and 184 correspond to digestion 'leftovers' that contain the VF+prefix and VR+suffix fragments respectively. The band at 100 bp corresponds to our desired digested product containing the sticky ends.
These results indicate that BsaI digestion of VF/R amplified products are viable, and this could be an alternate route to synthesizing MaSp monomers.
Future reactions may need to be run for longer periods of time.
