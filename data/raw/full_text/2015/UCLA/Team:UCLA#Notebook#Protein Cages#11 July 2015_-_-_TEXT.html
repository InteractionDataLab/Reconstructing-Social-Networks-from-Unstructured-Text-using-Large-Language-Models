Phillip's Notes
Introduction:  Today begins the first attempt at expressing the protein cage received from Yeates.  The glycerol stock will be used to streak a new plate, the bacteria will be grown and protein expression will be induced with IPTG.  Afterwards, affinity purification will be used to obtain a relatively pure protein cage sample for analysis to be determined.
Streaking plates:
Procedures:
A sample from the glycerol stock was scraped using a sterile wire loop and streaked onto ampicillin plates.  Plating was done in a zigzag fashion, and with aseptic techniques. The plate was set in the 37C incubator. LB was made using 25g of Difco LB mix, and autoclaved for 30minutes in a liquid cycle.
Observations:
The cells may have been burned as the tip was not cooled upon the second streak!  Olivia suggested to warm the plate up for ~ 20-30 minutes before use.  The plate was set in the 37C incubator at 2:40PM.
