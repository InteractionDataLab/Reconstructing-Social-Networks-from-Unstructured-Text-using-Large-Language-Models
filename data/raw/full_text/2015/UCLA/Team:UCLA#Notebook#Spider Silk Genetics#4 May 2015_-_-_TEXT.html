1 BsaI Digestion Test for 2AB
Tested digestion of 5 ug of plasmid to see efficiency of digestion.

Results are shown below:
Figure 1: Results  of  BsaI  digestion  test.  The  band  at  about  100  bp corresponds to the target digested insert.
∙ The digestion process works, so we’ll be proceeding with this protocol.
∙ We gel extracted the digested insert band. The end result was 11.9 ng/uL, A (260/280): 4.4
2 BsaI Digestion for Post-elution primer amplified MaSp
We BsaI digested the PCR products from previous PCRs using the following protocol

*For 2BC, we combined 8.84 uL of 33.9 ng/uL solution and 9.17 uL and 33.9 ng/uL solution to get 500 ng total.
2.2 Purification
∙ PCR purified the post-elution PCR digestion products and got the following yields:

Table 1: PCR purification of BsaI digested fragments generated through PCR using post-elution primers.
∙ Yield and absorbance for the digested inserts are not very good. This might be a problem due to the PCR process, even though product was generated.
3 Bacterial Propagation
∙ Grew 7 mL each of AB, BC, CA from glycerol stock for DNA extraction tomorrow.
