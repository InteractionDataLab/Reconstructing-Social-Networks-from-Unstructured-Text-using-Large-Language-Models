To-Do Plan
set up IABCT, IT and verify on gel (maybe e-gel)
amplify using post-elution primers.
verify this on gel too,
If both of these work, then bind the first IABCT to beads. Wash, then elute, then attempt amplification.
This will test whether the beads can bind to the biotin or not.
Making IABCT and IT
General scheme: Assemble IAB and CT, then combine both together.
Here is the concentrations of all ICA pieces used in this experiment.

Combined IAB and CT, incubated 25 C for 10 min.
Making IABCT results
Cast 1.5% TAE gel; 2 uL of 100 bp ladder.
Ran 10 uL of IABCT.
Ran 5 uL of CT, diluted to 10 uL.
Fig. 1 Result of IABCT generated without using beads. The band at ~406 bp corresponds to the IABCT construct. Compare to the ~100 bp band corresponding to the IT construct only. The DNA runs slightly larger due to presence of biotinylation.
The IABCT construct can be successfully generate without using beads. We will try incubating the leftover IABCT solution onto the streptavidin beads.
In the IABCT sample, there is also IT present due to leftover IT that was subsequently ligated. This IT may bind onto the beads as well.
PCR Amplification with Post-Elution Primers
Testing to see if the post-elution primers can be used to amplify IABCT, IT, prior to testing on beads.
Set up one 25 uL reaction each for IABCT, IT from earlier.

IABCT, IT can be amplified with Post-elution primers
Cast 1.5Â % TAE gel. 2 uL of 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 2 Amplification of IABCT, IT with post-elution primers. The ~400 bp product corresponds to the IABCT construct. The 100 bp band corresponds to the IT construct.
The amplification of IABCT is not very strong due to competition from the IT that is also present in the mixture.
BUT we show that post-elution amplification is possible. At this point, we will bind the IABCT and IT onto the streptavidin beads.
If amplification does not work, then it is most likely a  problem with bead binding.
IABCT, IT amplification with beads
10 uL of magnabind beads.
washed 2x using 100 uL 2x BW buffer.
Added 5 uL of 2x BW buffer, and 5 uL of relevant DNA (IABCT or IT).
Incubate 45 min at RT (~23 C) with rotation.
Removed and saved supernatant.
Washed 2x in 0.5x BW buffer.
Elute at 95 C for 5 min uisng 0.01% Tween-20, with occasional mixing.
PCR amplify bead eluate and post-incubation supernatant in 25 uL reactions.
use 2 uL of each sample as template.
same temperature cycle as above section, but with 25x cycles.
Visualize on 1.5% TAE gel, with 2 uL 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 3 Amplification of IABCT, IT after binding and eleution from beads. The expected product for IABCT amplification is ~406 bp. The expected product for IT amplification is ~100 bp.
The results show that the beads bind all of the present biotinylated DNA. Subsequent calculation show that the beads are in excess.
IT is amplified from both bead elutions, but IABCT is not amplified.
This result is confusing. May be due to selective amplification of IT.
BsaI Digestion of MaSp2 CA
We digested more CA monomers.
Digested 5 ug of 2CA plasmid in 50 uL reaction using 4 uL BsaI.
Incubated 50 C for 2 hours, then heat killed at 65 C for 20 min.
Ran on 1.5% TAE gel to visualize; used 2 uL NEB 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 4 BsaI digestion of MaSp2 CA. The band at 102 bp corresponds to the digested desired product.
We excised and gel extracted the 102 bp band using qiagen's kit.
23.66 ng/uL for the final concentration.
