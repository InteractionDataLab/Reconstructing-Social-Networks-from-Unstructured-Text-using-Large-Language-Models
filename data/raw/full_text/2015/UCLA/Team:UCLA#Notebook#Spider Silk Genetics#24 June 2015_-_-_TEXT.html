Cast 1.5% gel for visualize yesterday's ICA test results.
Used 2 uL 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 Post-elution primer amplification of Magnabind beads with the 3-mer construct consisting of Initiator-AB-BC-CA-Terminator. The expected product is ~400 bp long. No band is present at 400 bp.
The smear at 100 bp likely corresponds to primer dimers.
Perhaps we should conduct one more test with more controls.
This might be a bead problem, where the beads are not binding to the DNA.
Tomorrow, test binding entire IABCT construct onto beads, then amplifying.
