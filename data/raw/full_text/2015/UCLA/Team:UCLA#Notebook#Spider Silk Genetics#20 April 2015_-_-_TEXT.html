1 PCR Amplification of pSB1C3
∙ Due to poor amplification of pSB1C3 from friday, we are doing a temperature test today.
∙ Followed same protocol as 4/17/2015, but scaled to 3x 25 uL reactions.
∙ Decided to take nanodrop reading of the template Julian provided. It was 230 ng/uL. Instead of using stock concentration of template, we will use a 1:100 dilution. Results shown below.
Figure 1: pSB1C3 amplification temperature test
∙ We gel extracted the bands together. 26.4 ng/uL, A 260/280: 1.56.
2 EcoRI and PstI Digestion of MaSp 2AB, 2BC, 2CA, and pSB1C3
∙ We pooled together all the linearized pSB1C3 that we had. Final concentration: 16.5 ng/uL.
∙ Set up digestion as below:
