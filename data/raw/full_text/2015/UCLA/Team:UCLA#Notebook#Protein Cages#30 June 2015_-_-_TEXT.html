Phillip's notes:
Introduction:  Today, a meeting will be held with David in order to check our designed primers for PCquad for pET22b as well as how to design sequencing primers.  The order for our gene block and primers will be made when they are done.  Today will also be the presentation on PCR by Nithin and Tyler.
Meeting with David: David mentioned that the designed primers for PCquad pET22b looked fine.
Sequencing primers:  Between 500-700 bp from each other Two primers within gene for sequencing.  Avoid repetitive regions and follow general primer design guidelines. Sequencing primers were designed about 500bp from each other.
We made the following order.

Conclusion:  Since the gene block won’t come for another two weeks, the next few days will be focused on preparing for protein expression.  The main PCquad papers will be revisited, with special attention to the methods.  Once the protocols have been established, the PCquad clone from Yeates will be used to begin the initial protein expression.  Perhaps if another part of the team needs assistance, protein expression can be practiced with them.
