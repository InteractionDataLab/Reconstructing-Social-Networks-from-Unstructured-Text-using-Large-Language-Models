Final Gel Image
Redigest M2-9 and M1-9 using different sequence verified plasmids than yesterday.
Digest using same conditions, enzymes
Run on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of NEB 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Redone Final Gel image of ICA constructs. The incomplete digestion as well as the smear on M1-9 and M2-9 respectively are still present.
The continued presence of the strange digestion patterns leads me to believe that this may be a problem that originates in the sequence of these plasmids. The possibility of two plasmid species is probably ruled out by clean sequencing reads.
If we desire, we may repeat this image using XbaI and PstI to digest.
Protein Purification
Grew 10 mL starter cultures for the 5 12-mers, which include the hybrid constructs.
Inoculated M1-12(T7), M1/2[1:2]-12(T7), and M2-12(T7) into 1 L cultures.
[2:1] and [1:1] did not grow very well, possibly due to age of plates.
Streak M1/2[2:1]-12(T7) and M1/2[1:1]-12(T7) from glycerol stock for fresh colonies.
