ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Spun a fiber of cellulose acetate (with a little bit of "cheating" though)
20% w/v cellulose acetate dope
loaded into a 10 mL plastic syringe with a 27.5 gauge needle (luer lock attached)
extruded at a rate of 6 uL/min into water
upon extrusion, the dope would blob up, so I had to use tweezers to gently pull the mass away from the needle tip. Upon doing so, a thin fiber would follow
this fiber was not uniform at all, as it depended on how fast I was pulling the rest of the cellulose acetate away from the needle tip.
a fiber was also formed when extruded at a rate of 1 uL/min. I had to do the same pulling to get the fiber to form.
