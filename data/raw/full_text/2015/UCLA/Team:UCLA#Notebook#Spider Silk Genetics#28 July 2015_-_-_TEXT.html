Miniprep and Sequencing
Miniprep (qiagen) for M2-12(1C3) liquid culture.
Sequencing with VF, VR.
Maxiprep for M2-AB, BC, CA
Maxiprep using qiagen kit.
M1-AB: 111 ng/uL
M1-BC: 150 ng/uL
M1-CA: 350 ng/uL
BsaI Digestion for M1-AB, BC, CA
Olivia digested 5 ug of relevant plasmid in a 50 uL reaction with 4 uL of BsaI.
Digest 50 C 2 hrs, heat kill 65 C 20 min.
Run on 1.5% TAE gel to visualize. Used 3 uL of NEB 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 BsaI Digestion of M1-AB, BC, CA. The expected product size is 102 bp.
Excised the 102 bp bands for gel extraction
Also saved some of the digested backbone as linearized pSB1C3.
