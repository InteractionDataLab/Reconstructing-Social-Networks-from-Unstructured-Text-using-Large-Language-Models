Sequencing Results from Lac promoter/silk/spycatcher in psb1c3
Results looked mostly good with two small problem areas. I will be ordering a primer that starts upstream of this area to check by sequencing again.
Transformation with BBa_K525998 and Silk
With electrocompetent cells:
Thaw a 50uL aliquot of electro-competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes. Chill transformation cuvettes on ice. Warm up SOC at 37C.
Add 2uL diluted (1:100) vector+insert to 50uL competent cell stock.
Add stock in between the plates of the electroporation cuvette.
Take out warmed SOC and prepare incubation tubes.
Place cuvette in pulse machine
Setting: 1.8 kV
Preload 950uL of SOC.
Press pulse and immediately add 950uL SOC to cuvette.
Pipet up and down two times, then add to incubation tube.
Incubate at 37C for one hour.
While waiting, warm up two chloramphenicol plates (1:1, 1:10)
After incubation, pellet the bacteria and remove supernatent. Add 101 uL of SOC.
Make a 1:10 dilution in SOC .
Plate 100uL of each sample and spread with beads.
Incubate at 37C (incubated at 4:30PM)
Last time I used electrocompetent cells, I got only 1 colony. As a backup I will make another plate using BL21 chemically competent cells at a 1:10 dilution.
With BL21:
Thaw cells (~50uL) on ice for 10 minutes.
Add 2uL of ligated product (diluted)
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Rescue in 200 uL of SOC, incubate and shake for 1 hour.
Warm kanamycin plate at 37C.
Spin down bacteria to pellet, discard supernatant.
Add 101 uL of SOC, take 1uL and dilute 1:10.
Plate 100uL of bacteria (1:10) on a plate.
Spread with beads, incubate at 37C.
Picking colonies and Colony PCR of 7/17 Transformation
I picked 8 colonies off the 1:10 plate and suspended each in 100uL Nuclease Free Water.
Colony PCR Reaction
using Q5, transformed E. coli, and the VF2 and VR primers in preparation for insertion into psb1c3
Two reactions, one for each of the colonies.
