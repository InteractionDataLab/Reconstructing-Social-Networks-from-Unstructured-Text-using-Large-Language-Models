Primer Arrival
Primers have been synthesized. Refer here for complete data analysis of the primers.
Primers have been resuspended in Qiagen EB, briefly vortexed, and stored in -20 degrees Celsius. Forward primer suspended in 298 uL of EB (29.8 nmole pellet), and reverse primer suspended in 210 uL of EB (21 nmole pellet), for a final concentration of 100 uM in each primer stock.
For stock dilutions to working PCR aliquots, dilute both primers to 10uM. To get a 200 µL 10 µM solution, mix 20 µL of 100 µM oligo stock with 180 µL of nuclease free water.  Briefly vortex, and place in -20 degrees Celsius.
