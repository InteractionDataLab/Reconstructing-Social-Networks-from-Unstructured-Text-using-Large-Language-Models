HFIP Silk from last week gelled up
Looks like it doesn't hold for more than 1 day
Tried wetspin with godet v3.1
godet v3.1 is too short: the fiber keeps slipping off of the bottom, even with the overhang
Also, the screw holes on the godet need to be larger.
Started another concentration dialysis: 1:40 pm
Should remove at around 9:00 am tomorrow
Started a lyophilization: 2:30 pm
should remove on Wednesday at 2:30 pm
I tried to see how much volume could fit into one of the 3.5kDa cassettes
tried forcing 20mL into the cassette
It fits, but definitely leaks
When I extracted the liquid from the cassette, it was evident that some PEG had gotten in there
TOMORROW: Start the first dialysis for 2 silk samples asap in the morning.
