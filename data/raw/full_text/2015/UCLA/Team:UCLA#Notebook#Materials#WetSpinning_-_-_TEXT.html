Wet Spinning Protocol
Prepare a 13-20% w/v aqueous silk dope
Using a small gauge (large diameter) needle, draw the silk dope into a 1 mL syringe with Luer lock
Remove the needle and attach a 0.0005 inch inner diameter PEEK tubing
Place syringe in syringe pump, such that the tip of the PEEK tubing is immersed in the 70% v/v ethanol or isopropanol bath
Run syringe pump to extrude dope at rate of 1 - 20 uL/min
Allow the formed fiber to coagulate in the alcohol bath for at least 10 minutes
If immediately performing a post-spin stretch, keep the take-up spool immersed in the coagulation bath.
