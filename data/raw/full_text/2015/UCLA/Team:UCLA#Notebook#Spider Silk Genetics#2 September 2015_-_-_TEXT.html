Gel Purification for M1-15
Used zymo kit.
Yield 31.64 ng/uL A: 2.47
Need to do another PCR to get more.
PCR Amplification for M1-15
Used 1:1000 dilution of M1-15 from above as template.
Used ~100 pg of template in reaction.

Verified 5 uL of each reaction on 1% TAE gel with 2 uL of 1 kb ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of M1-15 using previous M1-15 as template. The expected band size is 1630 bp.
Decided that the band looks clean enough, so will PCR purify and not gel purify.
Eluted in 12 uL.
Digestion for M1-15
Digest 5 uL of the PCR product with E,P and 5 uL of PCR product with X,P.
Digest in a 50 uL reaction with buffer 2.1 and 1 uL of each relevant enzyme.
Digest at 37 C for 1.5 hrs, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
PCR purified the digestion product.
Ligation for M1-15
Ligate E,P digested products into pSB1C3.
Ligate X,P digested products into BBa_K525998(S,P)
Ligate at a 1:3 molar vector to insert ratio.
Ligate at 25 C for 1 hr, heat kill at 65 C for 20 min.
Transformation
Transform M1-15(1C3) into DH5(alpha) electrocompetent cells.
Dialyze against ultra-pure ddH2O.
Tried 3 times. First two times, the sample arced. Third time transformed 2 uL of a a 1:50 idlution.
Arc timme 5.4 s.
Transform M1-15(T7) into BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells.
