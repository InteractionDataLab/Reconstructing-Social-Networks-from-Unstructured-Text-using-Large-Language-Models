MEASUREMENT STUDY
Checking concentration of the dope from last Thursday
We aliquoted 100 uL to check the dry weight
11 mg in 100 uL
that's 11% wt/vol... which decreased
In addition, the dope has started gelling at the bottom of the tube
I think the dope is a lost cause. We'll have to do a new concentration dialysis.
Preparing HFIP dope
75 mg lyophilized silk in 268 uL of HFIP for a 28% w/v dope
Our procedure for dissolving the dope DIRECTLY IN THE SYRINGE
Prepare a tube apparatus with a tube that was already clogged. This will serve as the syringe "stopper." Add the stopper to the syringe luer lock
Cut the lyophilized silk into small pieces
Place the silk pieces into the syringe
pipette in the HFIP volume
Dip the plunger tip into HFIP
insert the plunger into the syringe body
invert the syringe, then push the plunger to purge some of the dead air. Ensure that ALL silk pieces are covered by the HFIP
Wait for HFIP to dissolve the silk. Periodically remove the stopper. This will allow bubbles to form and escape.
Some of our observations on this protocol:
push silk to the bottom of the syringe as you add the pieces. DON'T let the silk get densely packed!
cut the silk into the smallest pieces that you can
Don't drop any pieces!
