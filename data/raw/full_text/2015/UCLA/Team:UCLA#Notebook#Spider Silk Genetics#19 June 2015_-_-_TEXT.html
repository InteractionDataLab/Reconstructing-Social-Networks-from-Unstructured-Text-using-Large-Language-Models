6/19/2015: Testing ICA
Plan for ICA
Plan on creating a 3-mer, complete with initiator, terminator. Some slight modifications from Briggs et al.
5 uL of Magnabind streptavidin beads.
wash 2x using 2x BW buffer (15 uL washes).
resuspend in 5 uL 2x BW buffer.
Add 1 uL of 5 uM initiator and 4 uL ddH2O.
Rotate at RT 30 min.
Wash 2x using 0.5x BW buffer.
set up a 10 uL ligation reaction containing the following:
5 uL 2x T7 Ligase Buffer
50 ng relevant DNA (see table below)
1 uL of relevant cap (5 uM concentration)
ddH2O to 10 uL.
Incubate at RT for 10 min.
Repeat steps 5,6 for BC, CA and Terminator.
Wash 1x using ddH2O.
Elute in 15 uL of 0.01% Tween-20 at 95 C for 3 min.
Assess ICA using e-gel and PCR amplification at different cycles (12, 15, 17, 20)

ICA Assessment
E-gel
ran with David on 1% e-gel.
used 2.5 uL of eluted sample
used 1 uL of 100 bp ladder
diluted all samples to 20 uL using ddH2O
Nothing showed up. (no picture)
Decided to go ahead with PCR anyway, since there MIGHT be something.
PCR
Set up 4x 25 uL reactions each with 1 uL of eluted sample as the template and post-elution primers.
Followed Q5 protocol according to NEB, with the addition of GC enhancer.
We used the following cycle scheme:
98 C
30 sec
98 C
10 sec
66 C
15 sec
72 C
20 sec
repeat from step 2
12, 15, 17, 20x
72 C
2 min
12 C
hold
cast 1.5% TAE gel to visualize. Used 2 ul of 100 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 PCR amplification of 3-mer ICA eluate using post-elution primers. The expected product is 400 bp. There is no amplification in any of the lanes.
From the PCR, we can conclude that there was no finished ICA product.
This problem may lie in improper bead binding, improper ligations, or incorrect PCR.
MANY reasons why this might fail.
Tomorrow, test the streptavidin/biotin bead binding.
