Results
Used 1% e-gel, with 0.5 uL of 50 bp ladder.
Fig. 1 E-gel image of ICA 6- and 9-mer from elution and from PCR with post-elution primers. The expected product for 6-mer is 706 bp. The expected product for 9-mer is 1018 bp.
The resolution of this gel is somewhat too low to accurately size bands. We will run on a higher percentage gel later.
Elution products show nothing, but there are products after PCR amplification.
The presence of multiple bands may indicate non-specific amplification, or improper ICA.
Plan on doing temperature testing, and more troubleshooting.
Extension time was a bit short for a 9-mer.
