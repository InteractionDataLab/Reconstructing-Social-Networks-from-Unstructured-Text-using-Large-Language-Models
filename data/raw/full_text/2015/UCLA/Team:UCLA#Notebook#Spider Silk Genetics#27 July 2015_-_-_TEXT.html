PCR Amplification of 15-mer
Set up 2x 50 uL Reactions for amplification using M2-15mer template.
Scaled up reactions from 7/24/2015 .
Same conditions, but with 23 cycles instead of 20 cycles.
Proceed to gel purification.
Results
Colony number 1 popped open in incubator, and could not be salvaged
Cast 1% TAE gel. Ran with 2 uL of NEB 1kb ladder.
Fig. 1 Colony PCR results, and gel purification of M2-15. The expected product size for colony PCR of M2-12(1C3) is approx. 1.6 kb. The expected size for M2-15mer PCR is 1630 bp.
Colony PCR indicates that colonies 2, 3 may be the correct size. However, the bands are slightly off shifted from each other. This indicates that one of the samples is probably wrong.
Will grow 5 mL cultures for colonies 1,2,3 to send for sequencing.
The M2-15mer PCR is inefficient compared to previous results. We may need to optimize, or just brute force it.
Excised the band corresponding to the M2-15 for gel purification.
Bacteria Culture
Set up 1x 100 mL culture each for M1-AB, BC, CA
Set up 5 mL cultures for colonies M2-12(1C3) colonies 1, 2, 3.
