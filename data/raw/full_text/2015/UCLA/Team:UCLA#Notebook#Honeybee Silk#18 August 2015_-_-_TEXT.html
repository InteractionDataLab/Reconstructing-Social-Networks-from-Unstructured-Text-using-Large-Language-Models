Transformation with the Silk+GFP Construct
Redo of the transformation.
Using the new BL21 cells that I made last week
Thaw cells (50uL) on ice for 10 minutes.
Add 1uL of ligated product.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Rescue in 200uL of SOC, incubate and shake for 1 hour.
Warm chloramphenicol plates at 37C.
Spin down bacteria to pellet, discard supernatant.
Make 2 serial dilutions (1:10 and 1:100)
Plate 100uL of bacteria (1:1, 1:10, 1:100) on each plate.
Spread with beads, incubate at 37C.
