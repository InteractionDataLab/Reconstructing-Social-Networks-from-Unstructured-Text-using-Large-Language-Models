Spinning more Tamura
Fasih prepared a pooled Tamura fraction
concentration is 1.6 mg/mL
want to spin total volume of 300 uL
Let's prepare a dope such that the Tamura:silk mass ratio is 1:500, and 15% w/v.
recipe
225 uL of 20% w/v silk dope
56.1 uL of the pooled Tamura fraction
19.4 uL of ddH2O
procedure
spun at 6uL/min into 70% v/v ethanol
spun silk was wound around tweezers
results
the spin appears to be successful
the majority of the spin ended up in a single contiguous fiber. The fiber looks and feels much more like regular silk.
the resulting thread was much more resilient than the previous spin.
visual inspection under the UV box shows that it fluoresces
the same silk sample under the UV box. Its glow is very apparent. Sample on the right is Tamura co-spin. Sample on the left is native b.mori silk. Note that this picture was taken on July 20, while the sample was co-spun on July 14. Even after a week, it' still fluorescent!
UV microscopy verified its fluorescence.
20x magnification. 100% excitation light intensity.
thoughts
The fact that the fiber was stronger and thinner during this spin could be due to a number of factors:
this spin was 15% w/v. Last time's spin was 12% w/v.
As we wound the thread around tweezers, we were stretching the thread.
This spin's fluorescence is much less than last time's spin , which was much thicker. This is despite the fact that last time's spin had a silk:tamura ratio of 4000:1, while this time's spin has a ratio of 500:1. This indicates that the thickness of fiber under the microscope does matter -- thicker threads fluoresce more due to having a greater amount of GFP per length of thread.
