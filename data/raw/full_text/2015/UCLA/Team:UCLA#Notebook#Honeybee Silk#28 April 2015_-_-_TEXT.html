4/28 PCR to prepare 2 honeybee constructs for cloning
We are repeating the same PCR from 4/26, but only at one temperature instead of a gradient, and we are scaling the reaction up to 50 ul.

PCR products run on 1% agarose gel.
There were some non specific bands, but the appropriate bands were present. However, the bands were kind of off.  I think this is due to the samples running weird on the gel.  B/c the first two lanes were the exact same sample, just aliquoted, and they ran fairly differently.
Performed a gel extraction and purified using Qiagen min elute gel extraction kit
Results : 115 ng/ ul for silk tube #1, 86 ng/ul tube #2  (8.8 ul each tube) 136 ng/ul promoter + silk
