Miniprep
Samples 1 and 3 (inoculated) were miniprepped using the Zymo Plasmid Miniprep Kit.
OD
128.23 ng/uL
106.85 ng/uL
Both samples were sent in for sequencing.
PCR of Lac promoter/Silk/Spycatcher
Using primer 3 and 4 that contain overhangs with the Biobrick prefix and suffix.

Gel Visualization and Purification
I ran the PCR product on a 1% agarose gel, expected size ~1600bp
Results: There was a band at the appropriate length and another band, probably the result of non-specific binding. The correct band was extracted and purified using the Qiagen Gel Purification kit.
OD: 88.12ng/uL

Double Digestion of Purified PCR Product
The insert will be digested with EcoRI and Pst1 for preparation for ligation into the psb1c3 backbone (already digested with PstI and EcoRI).

Ran the digestion on a gel (all 50 ul) and compared to NEB 1 kb ladder.  There was a nice clean band at the appropriate size.

Calculating Competency
Calculating competency of cells prepared on 7/12.
Equation = # colonies / ug DNA plated
Using 2 ul of 50pg/ul puc19 vector to transform in to 50 ul
Counted 300 colonies
plated 1x10^-5 ug (1/10 of transformation reaction).
Therefore tranformation efficiency = 3 x 10^7 cfu/ug DNA
