Concentration Dialysis
We dissolved around 90 grams of PEG into 900 mL of water.
90 grams was used in place of 100 grams in order to obtain a slightly less concentrated product.
10 mL of aqueous silk solution was inserted into a dialysis cassette that had been hydrated.
The cassette containing the silk was placed into the PEG solution at 5:30 PM. We will finish the dialysis by 1:30 tomorrow.
