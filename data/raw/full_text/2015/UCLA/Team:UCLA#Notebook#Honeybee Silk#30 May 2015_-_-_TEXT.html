Gel Visualization of 5/26 PCR
The PCR products from 5/26 were run on a 1% agarose gel against a 1kB ladder. I used 5 uL of each sample and added 1uL of loading dye.
Gel Image
Results:
There were bands present for the correct base pair length (~1000bp). The sample run at 67C for the annealing step produced the cleanest, brightest band.
PCR of Honeybee G-block (Optimal)
From the gel visualization, 67C annealing temperature produced the best results. I am running a 50uL PCR reaction now under the optimal conditions.
