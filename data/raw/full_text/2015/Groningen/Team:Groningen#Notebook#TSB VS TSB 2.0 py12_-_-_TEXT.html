TSB_VS_TSB_2.0_py12
Investigates the best TSB medium and carrier for submerged biofilm growth of Bacillus subtilis PY79.
Investigating Bacillus subtilis PY79 submerged biofilm growth.
In both TSB media there is no submerged Bacillus subtilis PY79 biofilm formation attached to a carrier.

Optical density of  Bacillus subtilis py79 was 0.67.
Bacillus subtilis PY79 culture was diluted with demiwater until 1.5 mL with an OD of 0.22 was obtained. An OD of 0.22 was prefered as it would make the comparison with 32 plate experiment easier.
Bacillus subtilis PY79 was added to plates that contained one of both TSB media and one of four types of carriers. The plates were put on the shaking table in the 37 °C room.

In TSB* Bacillus subtilis PY79 did not grow with Whatman 2 and Whatman 4 as carriers. With a nylon and Whatmann 6 carrier bacterial clouds were found in the medium.
In TSB 2.0 Bacillus subtilis PY79 did not grow in any of the settings.
