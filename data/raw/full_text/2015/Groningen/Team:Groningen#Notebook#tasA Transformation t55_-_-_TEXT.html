tasA Heat Shock Transformation (t55)
The heat shock transformation of the ligation product was performed to put the DNA in E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation did not succeed.
Heat shock transformation
00:00, 23 July 2015 - 00:00, 23 July 2015
The heat shock transformation was performed and the culture was plated on LB+amp plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

The transformation of 23 July was checked. One white colony was visible on the plate, but this colony did not have the insert. So the ligation failed.
