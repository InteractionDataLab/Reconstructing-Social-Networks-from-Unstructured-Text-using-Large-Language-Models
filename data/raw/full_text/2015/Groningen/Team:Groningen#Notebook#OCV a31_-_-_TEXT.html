Measuring the membrane potential of biofilms grown in LB on a Whatman paper
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
Membrane potential of BD 1807 (abrb KO) shows that the biofilm on Whatman paper is partially ion selective.
11:30, 17 Augustus 2015 - 00:00, 17 Augustus 2015
After 42 hours of incubation at 37 °C of BD 1807 on Whatman paper in a LB plate, the following potentials were measured:
Whatman #1
Whatman #2
LB
0.017
0.016
