sinR_Transformation_PY79_si2
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis PY79
Overexpression of SinR in Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Transformation failed since no colonies were found.
Transformation
15:48, 24 August 2015 - 24:00, 24 August 2015
Standard competent medium (MC) was placed in the 37°C incubator. The OD was measured at 20:30, but Bacillus subtilis PY79 needed more time to grow. 1 µL of SinR DNA was added to 200 µL of MC with Bacillus subtilis PY79. The culture was plated at 24:00.

The transformation had failed as there were no colonies on the plate.
