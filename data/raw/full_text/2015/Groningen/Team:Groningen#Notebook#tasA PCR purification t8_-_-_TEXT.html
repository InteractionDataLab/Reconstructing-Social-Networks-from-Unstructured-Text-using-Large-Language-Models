tasA PCR purification (t8)
The Gibson assembly products were purified.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The purification of the Gibson assembly products was performed.
