Ferritin Gel Purification (fr4)
Purification of ferritin out of gel
Development ferritin
Purified ferritin was obtained
Gel purification
18:30, 31 August 2015 - 16:00, 10 August 2015
Digestion products were loaded on 1% agarose gel for purification.
Sample:
20 µL DNA (ferritin).
4 µL 6x buffer.
Ladder:
2 µL Thermo Scientific GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, ready to use.
Gel was run on 100 V for 30 minutes. Gel results show a band of 1500 bp. This corresponds to the size of ferritin. Gel was cut and dissolved in 2:1 binding buffer of the PCR purification kit and purified according to protocol. Sample was stored as: Ferritin dig (7.4 ng/µL, Nanodrop value).
