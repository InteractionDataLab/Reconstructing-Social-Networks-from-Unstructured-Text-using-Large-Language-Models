Lab tour high school students
Just before the wikifreeze the last group of highschool students visited us. Four classes of the Gomarus College Groningen were stopping by this morning, they got a lecture about our project and iGEM in general. At this talk we told the basics of molecular biology, this subject wasn’t covered in class yet. So we really had to start with the basics today, which was really exciting. With the talk we gave and a tour through our lab we hope that they can relate more to the subject. And that it would be easier to remember! They had some good questions about the carriers and our Bacillus subtilis. The carrier would be to weak to withstand the waterflow and how could bacteria do such things. After the explanation they were really enthusiastic about synthetic biology. Lets hope that they will spread the message.
