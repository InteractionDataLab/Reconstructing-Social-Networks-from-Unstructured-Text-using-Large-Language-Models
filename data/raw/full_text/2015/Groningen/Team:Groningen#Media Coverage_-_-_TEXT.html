Blog Sciencelinx
Starting in August we published a blog about our daily activities and our project. The blog was hosted on the University of Groningen website and will be concluded with a videoblog from the jamboree, which will also be shown on a local television channel. Comments indicated that the blog was easy to read and helped people understand synthetic biology better trough their identification with our team. We tried to be as open as possible and invited the readers of our blog to meet us in our office, where we could play our card game.

The Night of Arts and Sciences
We presented our project at the Night of Arts and Science, a city-wide festival during which the University town of groningen is transformed into a festival focussed on the arts and sciences and their intersection.
The Ubbo Emmius fund helped us set up a crowdfunding campaign . This not only presented a way to tap new funds, it also enabled a new kind of interaction with the public. By contributing financially, people felt they could really participate in our project, helping us break the boundaries of science.
A Unifocus camera crew visited our lab. They made an item about our project which was shown on the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen website and facebook.
We approached multiple websites to help us reach the public, focussing especially on our crowdfunding campaign.
