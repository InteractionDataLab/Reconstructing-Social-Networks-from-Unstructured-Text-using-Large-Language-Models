sinR_Transformation_3610_comI_si6
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Transformation failed since plating of culture was too late.

MC was placed in the 37°C incubator. The OD was measured at 14:37, Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI had grown enough. 1 µL of SinR DNA was added to 200 µL of MC with Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI at 19:55. The cultures were not plated until the following morning.

Experiment needed to be repeated, since the plating should have occured two hours after adding DNA.
