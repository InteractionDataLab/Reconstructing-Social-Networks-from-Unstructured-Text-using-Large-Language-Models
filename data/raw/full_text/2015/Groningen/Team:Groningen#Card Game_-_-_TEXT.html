Card Game
INTRODUCTION
In order to teach other people about synthetic biology, it was decided to make a card game, in which creativity and ethical reflection is triggered while including a competitive element. The goal of the game is to solve problems using synthetic biology and discuss if this solution is a unique and ideal one. When a set of four cards is formed, which together form a solution, it is therefore aimed to reflect if any disadvantages or impossibilities are present and see if they can be overcome.
RULES
Content
60 cards, divided into the following Tracks, inspired by iGEM.
12x Health issues
12x Food and Nutrition
12x Lacking Energy
8x Trash, Trash and Trash
8x Business Opportunities
8x A Local Problem
Number of players
The game can be played with 3-4 people, aged 15-99.
Goal of the game
The cards are divided into 6 tracks, namely Health Issues, Food and Nutrition, Lacking Energy, Trash, Trash and Trash, Business Opportunities, and A Local Problem. Each track has its own colour. Within each track, there are several sets of four cards that together form a project or solution to a problem. The goal of the game is to find the most correct combinations. In order to do this, the cards must be read well and the cards within a proposed set must be depended on each other for solving a problem.
Preparation
Shuffle the cards
Distribute three cards to each player.
Pile the left-over cards and put them in the middle of the table, face-down.
The Game
The game starts with the youngest player, who takes one card from the pile and chooses one card to put on the table face-up while reading out the text on the card. The number of cards in one’s hand remains three. The next turn is for the player on his left, who can again take a card from the pile and put one card on the table. The game is continued in this way until at a certain moment one of the following situations occurs. Either a player has three matching cards, with the complementary card lying face-up on the table, or a player has two matching cards, with the two complementary cards lying face-up on the table, or a player has one card at hand, with three complementary cards lying face-up on the table. In any of these three situations, the player can (but is not obliged to) take when it is his turn, the four cards and claim to have formed a set. It is then his duty to convince the other players that indeed these four cards together form the solution to a problem within the related Track. If it is agreed upon that this is indeed the case, the four cards are put away and the player can take new cards from the pile to continue playing with three cards. When there are no more new cards left, the game is continued with less than three cards, and players now only discard a card each turn, until all the sets are formed. Every player then counts the number of sets he has and the winner is announced.
The Winner
The winner of the game is the player that has the most sets of four cards. When the game ends in a draw, the player with the magic card wins.
