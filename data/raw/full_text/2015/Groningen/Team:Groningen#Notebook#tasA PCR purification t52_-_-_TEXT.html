tasA PCR purification (t52)
A PCR purification was performed to get rid of the enzymes used in the PCR process.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The sample was purified.
