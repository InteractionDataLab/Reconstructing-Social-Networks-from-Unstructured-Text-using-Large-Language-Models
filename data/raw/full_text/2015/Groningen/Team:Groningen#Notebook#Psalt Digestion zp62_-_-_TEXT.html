Psalt Digestion (zp62)
Digestion is performed to prepare DNA for ligation. Different constructs were digested to put Psalt with different genes in BBa_K823023
To create a salt inducible promotor.
Digestion was done.
Restriction
00:00, 26 August 2015 - 00:00, 26 August 2015
The following constructs were digested. After digestion DNA was purified using gel purification on a 1% agarose gel, run at 100V and cut out. Afterwards the samples were purified using a PCR purification kit.
