tasA Digestion (t75)
The DNA was digested to obtain tasA and Psalt.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The tasA and Psalt DNA were digested for use in ligation.
Restriction
00:00, 17 August 2015 - 00:00, 17 August 2015
tasA in pSB1C3 was digested with SpeI and PstI as restriction enzymes. The salt promoter PCR product was restricted using XbaI and PstI. All constructs were put on 1% agarose gel after digestion.
