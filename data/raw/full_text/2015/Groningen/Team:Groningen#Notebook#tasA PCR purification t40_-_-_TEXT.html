tasA PCR purification (t40)
The tasA digestion sample was purified.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The tasA DNA was purified using the PCR purification kit.
