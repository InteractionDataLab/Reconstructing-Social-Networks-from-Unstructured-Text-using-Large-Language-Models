tasA Digestion (t79)
The restriction was performed to make ligation possible.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The restriction of tasA and the salt promoter was performed.
Restriction
00:00, 19 August 2015 - 00:00, 19 August 2015
The following constructs were digested: the salt promoter in pSB1C3 with SpeI and PstI, and tasA in pSB1C3 with XbaI and PstI. After digestion the constructs were put on an 1% agarose gel.
