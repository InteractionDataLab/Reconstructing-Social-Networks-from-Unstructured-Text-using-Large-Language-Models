Digestion BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 (t20)
In this experiment the BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 backbones were digested to afterwards ligate it with tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The digestion of the BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 backbones was successful.

The samples were digested for 2 hours at 37 °C. Afterwards they were loaded on 1% agarose gel with SERVA DNA stain G.

Samples for on the gel.
The gel was run on 100 V for ∼1 hour and the following bands were visible:
tasA at ∼800-900 bp
K823023 (∼5000 bp) including a band of its RFP insert (∼1100 bp)
K823024 (∼6000 bp) including a band of its RFP insert (∼1100 bp)
These band sizes match the in silico sizes.
