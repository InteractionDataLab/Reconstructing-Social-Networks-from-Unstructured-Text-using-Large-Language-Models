tasA PCR (t9)
PCR was performed to amplify tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Sample 1 was not assembled correctly; sample 2 did show a band on gel with the right size.

The PCR products were stored as tasA DNA 1 & tasA DNA 2 and PCR 4 prod 20-5-2015 (side). On gel it was checked if the PCR had worked out. A gel was made of 1% agarose with EtBr. The loaded samples consisted of the components listed below. The samples were compared with 3 µL of DNA ladder.
Sample:
1.5 µL 6x loading buffer
2.5 µL \( \mathrm{H_2O}\)
2 µL sample
Ladder:
3 µL GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder
On the gel there were no bands visible for sample 1. Apparently the tasA product had not formed. The gel of sample 2 did show a product at ± 950 bp. This fragment was checked with restriction enzymes to find out if the restriction sites were absent in the tasA gene.
