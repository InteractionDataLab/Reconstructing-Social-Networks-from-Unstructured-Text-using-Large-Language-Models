Lab tour high school students of Hondsrugcollege Groningen
Today Lianne Wieske visited our lab with 10 VWO students from the Hondsrugcollege Groningen. Last year Lianne was an iGEM member herself and today she was giving a tour at the Linneausborg with a group of third year VWO students. Obviously Lianne is really enthusiastic about iGEM and she gave us some time to tell the students about iGEM and our project. So we gave the group a little tour around the lab and we explained our ideas. They seemed to be really interested and at the end of the day they all wished us luck for the Giant Jamboree in Boston. We hope that it will help us. Lianne thank you for stopping by with the enthusiastic students!
