GFP Miniprep (zp43)
A miniprep is performed to extract plasmid DNA from E. coli that was grown overnight in liquid LB + corresponding antibiotics.
To create a salt inducible promotor.
Miniprep was successful. Plasmid DNA was extracted.
Plasmid DNA purification
00:00, 18 August 2015 - 00:00, 19 August 2015
A colony from pSB1C3 + GFP + RBS was grown overnight in liquid LB + chloramphenicol and miniprepped the day after to extract plasmids.
