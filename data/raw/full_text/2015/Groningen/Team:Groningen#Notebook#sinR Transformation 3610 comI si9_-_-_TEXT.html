sinR_Transformation_3610_comI_si9
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
The transformation succeeded, as there were colonies on the plate after transformation.
Transformation
10:00, 26 August 2015 - 00:00, 26 August 2015
Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI was added to LB at 10.00.
Afterwards the optical density of Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI was was measured: 0.120.
At 15:24 Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI was added to MC and the mixture was placed in the 37°C incubator.
At 20:24 1 µL of SinR plasmid was added to the MC mixture, which was placed back in the 37°C incubator.
At 23:00 the transformed Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI was plated.
