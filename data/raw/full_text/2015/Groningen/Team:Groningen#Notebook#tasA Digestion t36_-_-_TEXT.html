tasA Digestion (t36)
tasA plasmid was digested to check for right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
There was nothing visible on gel. The gel was probably too hot when adding the DNA stain G.

Digested tasA from backbone using EcoRI and PstI to check ligation. For this, a Mastermix was made for 13 samples (∼300 µL).

The samples were incubated for 2 hours at 37 °C. Afterwards they were loaded on 1% agarose gel with 1:50000 DNA stain G.

Ladder:
10 µL Quick-Load® Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb)
There was nothing visible on the gel. The gel was probably too hot when adding the DNA stain G.
