tasA Sequencing (t59)
The tasA DNA was send for sequencing to check if the sequence was correct.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Sequencing showed that the tasA (T2) sample is correct.
None
00:00, 30 July 2015 - 00:00, 30 July 2015
The transformation of 29 July was checked. No colonies were visible on the LB+cm plate. T2 was send to Macrogen for sequencing.
