Transformation_a30
Transform Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI strain with purified full genomic DNA of BD 1807 strain.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
Transformation succeeded, as colonies were found on the plate.

MC1x was made and a colony of Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI from plate called LB comI of 4 August was added to MC. Finally, BD 1807 DNA was added to a 3610 delta comI mixture. The sample was put in the shaking incubator at 37 °C.
