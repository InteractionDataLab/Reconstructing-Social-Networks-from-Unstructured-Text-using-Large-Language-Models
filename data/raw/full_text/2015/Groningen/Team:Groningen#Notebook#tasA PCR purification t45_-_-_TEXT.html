tasA Purification (t45)
The digested samples were purified for ligation.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
In this experiment the digested tasA, Psalt and K823023 were purified.

00:00, 16 July 2015 - 00:00, 16 July 2015
The samples were purified using the PCR purification kit, using 20 µL elution buffer. The samples were stored as 1 and 2, with on the side 16-7-15.
