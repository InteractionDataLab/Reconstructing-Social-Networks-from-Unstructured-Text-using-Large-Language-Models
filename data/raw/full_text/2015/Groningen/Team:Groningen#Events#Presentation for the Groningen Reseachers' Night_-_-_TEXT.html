Presentation for the Groningen Reseachers' Night
At the exact same day as our final presentation we are going to do something special. In Groningen there will be the Researchers' Night which is part of the European Researchers Night. It is organised by FabLab Groningen, Science LinX, Groninger forum and the Infoversum and we are invited to give a talk about our project and iGEM. This wasn’t possible if we weren’t living in the 20th century because we are going to give a live talk from Boston! Luckily prof. dr. Gert-Jan Euverink will help us, he will be actually present at this night. So when the internet connection fails he will be able to tell some more about our project and answer the questions from the audience. Also the visitors of the Researchers Night have the ability to play our card game!  We are looking forward to it and see you in Boston!
