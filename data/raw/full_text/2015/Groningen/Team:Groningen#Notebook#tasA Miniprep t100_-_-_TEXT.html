tasA Miniprep (t100)
Extract plasmid from E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA and Psalt DNA was extracted.
Plasmid DNA purification
00:00, 19 August 2015 - 00:00, 19 August 2015
The miniprep was performed from overnight cultures with the miniprep kit from Thermo Scientific. The protocol was performed as described by manufacturer. Isolated plasmid was checked on 1% agarose gel.
