sinR_Transformation_PY79_si5
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis PY79.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Transformation failed since cultures were plated to late.

MC was placed in the 37°C incubator. The OD was measured at 14:37, Bacillus subtilis PY79 had not grown enough.  OD was measured to be 0.021 after 10x dilution with demiwater. 1 µL of SinR DNA was added to 200 µL of MC with Bacillus subtilis PY79 at 19:55. The cultures were not plated until the following morning.

Experiment needed to be repeated, since the plating should have occured two hours after adding DNA.
