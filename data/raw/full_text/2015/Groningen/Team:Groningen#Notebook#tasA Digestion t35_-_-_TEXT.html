tasA Digestion (t35)
tasA plasmid was digested to check for right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
There was not much visible on gel. The experiment was repeated with more DNA.

All tasA samples were digested to check for the insert. For this a Mastermix for digestion was made.

Sample for digestion.
The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours and 15 minutes. Afterwards they were put on a 1% agarose gel with 1:50000 DNA stain G. The gel was run on 120 V.
Sample:
5 µL sample
1 µL 6x buffer
Ladder:
10 µL Quick-Load® Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb)
On the gel there was not much visible, so the procedure was repeated with more DNA.
