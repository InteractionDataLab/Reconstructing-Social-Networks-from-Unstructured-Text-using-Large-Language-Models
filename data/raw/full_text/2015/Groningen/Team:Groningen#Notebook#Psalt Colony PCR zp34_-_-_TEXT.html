A colony PCR was performed to check the insert of a transformed E. coli.
To create a salt inducible promotor.
Gel results show that the Psalt is inserted into pSB1C3.

White colonies from the plate with transformed E. coli (pSB1C3 + Psalt) were checked for the right insert with the primers seen in table 1. After PCR samples were loaded on 1% agarose gel with SERVA DNA Stain G 1:50000. Gel results show the correct insert.
