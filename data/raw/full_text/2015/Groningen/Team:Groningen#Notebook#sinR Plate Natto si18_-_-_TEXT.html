sinR_Plate_Natto_si18
Testing which Whatmann carrier produces the best biofilm of transformed Bacillus subtilis natto on LB plus spectinomycin plates.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
There were no differences in biofilm growth between both carriers.

Transformed Bacillus subtilis natto was added to Whatmann 2 and Whatmann 4 carriers that were placed on LB plus spectinomycin plates.

A uniform biofilm was covering plate, looks slightly granular, on both Whatmann 2 and Whatmann 4 carriers.
