tasA Digestion K823023 (t44)
The miniprepped samples were digested to check for the right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA was inserted successfully into pSB1C3.

The miniprepped samples were digested to check for insert. It was seen that indeed tasA was inserted successfully into pSB1C3. The insert was stored as T2.
