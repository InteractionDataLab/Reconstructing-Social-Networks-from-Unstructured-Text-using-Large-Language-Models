Ethics class for high school students
On the 11th of June we (Harm en Marieke) visited Gomarus College in Groningen to tell something about sustainable energy and some ethics about our project. We started with an introduction about sustainable energy and why the Netherlands is so keen about this topic. After that we talked about our project and our goals and how we incorporated synthetic biology in blue energy. Further we discussed the ethics behind our project. Is it okay to put GMOs in a power plant? And their opinion on GMOs overall. The opinion of the teacher was to be careful with all GMOs, hence they could also create environmental disasters (according to him). We explained that used GMOs for industrial purposes are thoroughly checked before usage and the chances that they will cause harm are very little. Overall the lesson was a success, and ended with an invitation to see our lab!
