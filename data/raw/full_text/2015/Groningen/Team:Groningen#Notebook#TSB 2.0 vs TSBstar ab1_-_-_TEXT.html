Test difference between TSB* and TSB 2.0 (ab1)
Testing TSB* and TSB2.0
making a biofilm stronger by knockout abrB
TSB* and TSB 2.0 were tested

TSB medium was made using our own recipe. TSB* and TSB 2.0. TSB* is from Wikipedia and TSB 2.0 is based on literature, what amounts of glucose and NaCl are beneficial for biofilm growth. Test difference between TSB* and TSB 2.0 with With four different strains: JH642, PY79, 3610 comI and -3610 comI ΔabrB on 4 different carriers: nylon, W2, W4 and W6. Experiment was performed in triplo. OD measurement  JH    0.85   PY    0.67   3610    1.53   ΔabrB    0.40   All ODs were diluted until 1.5 mL with an OD of 0.22 was obtained. The samples were diluted with water. An OD of 0.22 was used to make comparing with the 128 plates experiment easier.
