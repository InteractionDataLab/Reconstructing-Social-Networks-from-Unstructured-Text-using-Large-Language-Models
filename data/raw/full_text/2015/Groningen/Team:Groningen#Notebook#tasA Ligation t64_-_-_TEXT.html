tasA PliaG Ligation (t64)
The PliaG promoter is ligated with tasA instead of the salt promoter, as this did not work.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
PliaG was ligated with T2 (tasA).
