tasA K823023 Transformation
The tasA K823023 ligation product was transformed into E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The transformation into E. coli failed.

10 µL of the ligation mixture of tasA with K823023 was put in 100 µL competent E. coli (1). Two mixtures were streaked out on an LB+amp plate:
90% plate (90 µL)
10% plate (10 µL)

The transformation was checked. No colonies were visible on either plate so the transformation failed.
