tasA Miniprep (t43)
The samples were miniprepped and afterwards digested to check for the right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The tasA DNA was isolated from E. coli.
