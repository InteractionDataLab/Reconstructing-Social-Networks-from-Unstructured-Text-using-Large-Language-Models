tasA Gel Purification (t29)
In this experiment, the PCR product of tasA was purified for use in ligation.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The PCR product of tasA was purified.
Gel purification
00:00, 8 June 2015 - 00:00, 8 June 2015
The band of tasA was hardly visible, but was nevertheless cut out and purified with the PCR purification kit.
