Digestion of RFP backbone (t24)
Restriction of the RFP backbone and tasA DNA, in order to make the ligation possible.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The RFP backbone and tasA DNA were digested.
Restriction
00:00, 30 April 2015 - 00:00, 30 April 2015
Three different possible backbones were grown overnight in LB+amp and LB+cm, of which one was the RFP backbone.
