Digestion tasA, BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 (t30)
tasA, BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 were digested for ligation.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA, BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 were digested.

For the digestion of tasA and the plasmids (BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024), a Mastermix was made, which was added to the DNA.
