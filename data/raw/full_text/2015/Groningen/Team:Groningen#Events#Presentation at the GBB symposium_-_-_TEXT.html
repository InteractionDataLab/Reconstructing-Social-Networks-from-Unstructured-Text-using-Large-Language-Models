Presentation at the GBB symposium
2 September was the annual symposium from the Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute (GBB). During this symposium young ambitious PhD students and professors can present their latest work. iGEM Groningen was kindly invited by the GBB, to give a presentation about their project Blue Bio Energy.  The presentation was given by  our team member Wiebrand de Boer. Wiebrand presented in a clear way, what resulted in an interested audience. We received many questions suggestion about our project. Not only about the pro’s and cons about Blue Bio Energy, but also on how to improve this project. After the presentation there was time to talk with the audience in person and to go further into detail. This led to interesting discussions and conversations.
