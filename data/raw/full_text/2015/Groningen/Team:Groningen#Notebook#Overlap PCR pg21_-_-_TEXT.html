Overlap PCR (pg21)
PGA was ordered in two separate pieces. These two have to be combined. This was attempted with an overlap PCR where two overlapping fragments can be combined.
Combine the two ordered parts of PGA.
Band have the correct size.

00:00, 28 July 2015 - 00:00, 28 July 2015
Ordered PGA from IDT in 2 parts was PCRed to obtain the whole PGA. Used an decreasing annealing temp after each 5 cycli.
The following PCR mix was prepared.
