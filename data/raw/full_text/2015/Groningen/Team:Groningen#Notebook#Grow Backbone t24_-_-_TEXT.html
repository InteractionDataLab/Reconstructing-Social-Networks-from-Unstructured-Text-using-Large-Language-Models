Grow Backbone (t24)
Grow E. coli with plasmid for plasmid extraction for ligation with tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
E. coli with plasmid was grown in LB. Bacillus did not have a plasmid.
None

The first E. coli backbone grew overnight with amp, the second and third backbones, which were Bacillus backbones, grew with cm.
