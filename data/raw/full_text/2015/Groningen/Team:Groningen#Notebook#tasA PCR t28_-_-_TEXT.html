tasA PCR (t28)
In this experiment tasA was PCR'ed to increase the amount of DNA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
On gel, the band for tasA was hardly visible, but the PCR possibly did work.

In this experiment it was attempted to increase the amount of tasA. For this first a Mastermix was made, to which primer and DNA were added.

The PCR prduct was loaded on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G (1:50000) and run for 1 hour on 100 V with the following samples.
Sample:
30 µL DNA (tasA).
10 µL 6x buffer.
Ladder:
10 µL NEB ladder.
The band of tasA was hardly visible on gel.
