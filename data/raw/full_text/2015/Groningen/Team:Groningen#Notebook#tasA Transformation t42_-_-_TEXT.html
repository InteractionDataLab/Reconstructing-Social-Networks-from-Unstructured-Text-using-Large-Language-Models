tasA Heat Shock Transformation (t42)
The ligation product of tasA in pSB1C3 was transformed into E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The heat shock transformation of tasA in pSB1C3 was successful.
Heat shock transformation
00:00, 8 July 2015 - 00:00, 8 July 2015
Afterwards a heat shock transformation was performed with 100 µL NEB competent cells + ligation product.
90% plate (90µL)
10% plate (10µL)
The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.

The transformation was checked. On both 10% and 90% plates a large amount of colonies had grown, so the transformation was successful. 4 colonies from the 10% plate were grown overnight in 3 mL LB+cm (6 µL 1/500).
