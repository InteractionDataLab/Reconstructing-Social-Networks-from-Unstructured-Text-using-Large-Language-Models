Transformation_a27
Transform Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI strain with purified full genomic DNA of BD 1807 strain.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
Transformation failed, as no colonies were found on the plate.

B.s. 3610 comI colony was placed in MC according to protocol for Bacillus subtilis transformation. The tube was put in the shaking incubator at 37 °C.
At 12:22 the OD at 600 nm was measured of the transformation culture:0.00. The sample was put back in the shaking incubator at 37 °C for overnight growth.

The OD at 600 nm was measured again: 0.82. 400 µL of culture was mixed with 10 µL BD1807 DNA for obtaining the abrB knock out. The sample was put in a new 15 mL tube in the shaking incubator at 37 °C.
At 13:30 100 µL of culture was put on an LB plus chloramphenicol plate. This plate was put in the incubator at 37 °C. The rest of the culture was stored in the fridge at 4 °C.
