Lecture, lab tour and card game for high school students
A group of 6 VWO students from the Celeanum gymnasium Zwolle had a day programme in and around our building with Science Linx. Luckily there was some time left to spend with us. So we could talk about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Maybe we have created some future iGEM members!
Because there were so many students we divided them into two groups. The first group started with a little lecture about synthetic biology and our project. The students were very interested in synthetic biology and our project during the lecture. We also told something about the previous project from iGEM Groningen to show that synthetic biology can be used in different industries. We followed the lecture with a tour through the lab. The student were very impressed with our lab. We showed them where we did our cloning, biofilm growth and the measurement of the our biofilms. Although they could not perform a little experiment they were very enthusiastic about the lab and our project.
Proceeding with a lab tour so they could see the machines and other equipment that is necessary for cloning work and working on our project in general including the test set up for the biofilm.
The second group started with our card game. They are very lucky people because they were the first people that could play the card game. After a long process of developing and testing that we did ourself the final moment was there and we could show it to the public. After a short introduction about synthetic biology and ourself we explained the card game. Most of them were really interested although the game is a little difficult. After a while most people started to get it and they became fanatic! Then we switched the groups and we played the game again with the other group while the first group was in the lab now. A really interesting day the kids had really cool questions and gave us great feedback on the card game so thanks a lot for the great day! Also thanks to Science Linx for this opportunity!
