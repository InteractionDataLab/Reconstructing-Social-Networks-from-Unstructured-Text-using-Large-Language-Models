Smear test
Several different ways of applying bacteria to a carrier were compared.

Tried different ways to grow B. subtilus 3610 on Nylon.  OD of the applied culture was 2.40 at 600 nm. We sterilized the carriers with UV before use. The dots are applied by pipetting. The smearing was done using a sterile plastic drigalski spatula.
Pipetting patterns used: 3 µL dots (A), 200 µL dot (B), 9 µL dots (C).
Smearing. 36 µL was pipetted on a carrier and distributed using a spatula.
The smearing method, which we expected to be the best, was duplicated with LB medium. All other tests were done on MSGG.
