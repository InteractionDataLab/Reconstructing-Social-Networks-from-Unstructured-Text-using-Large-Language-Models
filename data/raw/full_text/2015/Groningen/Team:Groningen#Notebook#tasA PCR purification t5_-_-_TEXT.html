tasA PCR purification t5
A PCR purification was performed to get rid of the enzymes used in the PCR process.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The PCR product was purified.

00:00, 18 May 2015 - 00:00, 18 May 2015
The purification of PCR 2 product 5 and 6 with gelpurification on 1% agarose gel with EtBr was performed. The sample was purified using the PCR purification kit.
PCR product 6 contains part 3 and 4 of TasA.
PCR product 5 contains part 5 of TasA.
Stored in freezer at -20 °C as 2.5 and 2.6.
