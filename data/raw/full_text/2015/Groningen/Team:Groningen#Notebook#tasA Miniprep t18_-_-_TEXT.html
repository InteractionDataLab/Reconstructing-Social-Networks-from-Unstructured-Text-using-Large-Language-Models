tasA Miniprep (t18)
Extract plasmid from E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The bacterial culture was miniprepped successfully.
Plasmid DNA purification
00:00, 27 May 2015 - 00:00, 27 May 2015
All cultures grew, of both the 1/100 and the 1/1000 amp concentrations. The cultures were miniprepped overnight according to the miniprep kit manual. The cultures were stored as tubes 1-5. DNA concentrations were determined using Nanodrop.
