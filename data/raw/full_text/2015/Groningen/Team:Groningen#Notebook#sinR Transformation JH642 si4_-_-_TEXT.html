sinR_Transformation_JH642_si4
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis JH642.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
The transformation had failed as the culture was plated to late.

MC was placed in the 37°C incubator. The OD was measured at 14:37, Bacillus subtilis JH642 had grown enough.1 µL of SinR DNA was added to 200 µL of MC with JH642 at 19:55. The cultures were not plated until the following morning.

Experiment needed to be repeated, since the plating should have occured two hours after adding DNA.
