tasA Gel purification (t14)
Obtain purified RFP backbone.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Purification of RFP backbone was carried out.
Gel purification
00:00, 21 May 2015 - 00:00, 21 May 2015
Before the ligation of the RFP backbone with tasA (4.2) was performed, first a gel extract was made on 1% agarose gel with EtBr to get rid of the RFP insert.
Sample:
4 µL 6x buffer
20 µL sample (RFP backbone)
Ladder:
3 µL GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder
The gel was run for ∼45 minutes at 100 V. Afterwards the band for the RFP backbone was cut out to obtain purified RFP backbone without the RFP insert. The RFP backbone DNA was extracted from the gel with the PCR purification kit. For this binding buffer was added to the cut out gel in the ratio 2:1 binding buffer:gel weight. It was stored as BB1, purified backbone (50 µL elution buffer).
