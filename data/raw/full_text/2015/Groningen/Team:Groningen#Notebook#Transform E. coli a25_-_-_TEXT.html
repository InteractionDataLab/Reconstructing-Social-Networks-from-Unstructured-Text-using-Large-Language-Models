Transforming E. coli with ligation products containing either 168 or BD 1807 DNA.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
Transformation failed an no colonies were found on the plates.
