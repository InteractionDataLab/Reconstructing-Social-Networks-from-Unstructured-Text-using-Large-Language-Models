Restriction analyse (th8)
Restricion analysis from plasmids
Extra integration of DNA in thrC locus
Correct analysis from the plasmids
none
00:00, 28 Augustus 2015 - 00:00, 28 Augustus 2015
A restriction analysis of the miniprepped thrC locus 1 was performed. To 5 µL from each plasmid, 13 µL MiliQ, 1 µL fast digest EcoRV and 1 µL fast digest buffer was added. The mixtures were incubated for one hour at 37 °C. The correct plasmid would have 2 bands; K823023 (original) or pdg1664 (original) would show one band. Fortunately, all 5 plasmids had two bands. One of the plasmids will be used further (thrC plasmid A).
