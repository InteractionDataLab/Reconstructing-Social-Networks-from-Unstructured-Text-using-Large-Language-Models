tasA Primer Design t1
Design primers for the isolation of DNA and getting rid of restriction sites within the gene.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Designing the primers was successful.
