Transforming Bacillus subtilis PY79 with k823023 (Munich backbone). Plasmid k823023 was designed for Bacillus subtilis transformations. The question remains whether this plasmid is also suited for transformation with Bacillus Subtilis PY79. This was investigated by Transforming Bacillus subtilis PY79 with k823023.

The optical density at 600 nm of Bacillus subtilis PY79 was measured after 5 hours of growing. The optical density of Bacillus subtilis PY79 was 0.08
To increase OD 1 µL k823023 was added to 400 µL of Bacillus subtilis PY79 culture and put in a fresh 15 mL tube. The tubes were put in the shaking incubator for 2 hours. Afterwards the OD of PY79 was measured and had increased to 0.15.
