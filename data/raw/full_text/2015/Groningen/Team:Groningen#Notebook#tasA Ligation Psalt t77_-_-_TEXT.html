tasA Ligation Psalt (t77)
The tasA DNA was ligated with the salt promoter to regulate the expression of TasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA was ligated with Psalt.
