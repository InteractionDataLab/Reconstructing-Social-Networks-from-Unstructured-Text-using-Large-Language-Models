Repeated PCR of abrB knock out from BD1807 strain and DNA provided by Jan Willem.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
PCR failed as no bands were found on agarose gel.
