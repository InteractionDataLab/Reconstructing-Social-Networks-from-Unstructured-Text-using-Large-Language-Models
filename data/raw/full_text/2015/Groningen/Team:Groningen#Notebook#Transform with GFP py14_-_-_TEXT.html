Transformation of Bacillus subtilis PY79 with GFP
Investigates whether Bacillus subtilis PY79 can be transformed with GFP containing plasmid.
Investigating Bacillus subtilis PY79 submerged biofilm growth.
No green fluorescent colonies were found. Therefore, Bacillus subtilis PY79 is not able to be transformed with this GFP plasmid.
