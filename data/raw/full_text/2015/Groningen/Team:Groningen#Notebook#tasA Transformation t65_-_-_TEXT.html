tasA Heat Shock Transformation (t65)
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli using a heat shock transformation.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation products of tasA (T2) with PliaG were transformed into E. coli.
Heat shock transformation
11:30, 7 August 2015 - 13:30, 7 August 2015
A heat shock transformation was performed by adding 20 µL of DNA (ligation product of T2 with PliaG) to 10 µL competent NEB cells. After 2 hours the culture was plated on LB+cm and incubated overnight at 37 °C.
