Investigating optimal medium and carrier for submerged Bacillus subtilis PY79 biofilm growth. Four types of carriers were tested: Whatman 2, Whatman 4, Whatman 6 and nylon. Four types of media were tested: MSgg, TSB, LB with glucose, LB without glucose. All experiments were performed in duplo.
Investigating Bacillus subtilis PY79 submerged biofilm growth.
None of the carriers or media promote submerged biofilm growth, while being attached to a carrier.

The four types of medium were prepared. Afterwards, these four types of medium were poured in petri dishes. Each of the four carriers were added to a petri dish containing one of the four media. After adding Bacillus subtilis PY79 to the plates, the plates were placed on the 37 °C shaking table.

Compared the effect of different carriers and media on the submerged biofilm growth of Bacillus subtilis PY79.
In msGG the plates with nylon, Whatman paper 4 and Whatman paper 6 have pellicles. Nylon has a red seamonster. Whatman paper 6 has small pieces of aggregated bacteria. Nylon and Whatman paper 4 have larger film-like bits. The plates with  Whatman paper 2 have only a cell suspension.
In LB plus glucose more biofilm is visible. However, the biofilms are not attached to the nylon carrier. Whatman paper 4 and Whatman paper 6 are equally good. Some biofilm is attached to the edges of the carrier and the rest. Whatman paper 2 has quite a lot of growth in the medium, threads are visible.
In LB without glucose the cells are more suspended than in LB glucose medium. The plates with the nylon carrier hardly demonstrated submerged growth. One plate with Whatman paper 4 has some biofilm on the carrier, but it does not stick very well. The plates with Whatman paper 2 and 6 have cell suspension in the medium.
In TSB the plates with the nylon carriers show no cell growth. The plates with Whatman paper 6 have some bacterial growth in the medium and around the carrier. The plates with Whatman paper 4 have some bacterial clouds, but not much. Whatman paper 2 plates showed only cell suspensions.
In conclusion, nylon as a carrier did not work for submerged growth of Bacillus subtilis PY79. As a medium LB plus glucose is best. There is no difference between the type of Whatman paper concerning submerged growth of Bacillus subtilis PY79 .
