tasA Digestion pSB1C3 (t39)
In this experiment 24TA 3 (BBa_K823024 + tasA insert) and pSB1C3 were digested.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The samples were digested for one hour.

In this experiment tasA was ligated into pSB1C3. For this first a Mastermix was made for the digestion of 24TA 3 (BBa_K823024 + tasA insert) and pSB1C3 EcoRI and PstI.
