PCR (pg9)
PCR was carried out to combine the two fragments of PGA into one.
Make a more negatively charged biofilm.
PCR failed.

Ordered PGA from IDT in 2 parts was PCRed to obtain the whole PGA. Used an decreasing annealing temp after each 5 cycli.
The following PCR mix was prepared.

PCR Thermocycle.
PCR product was loaded (1µL product + 4µL H2O + 1µL 6X loading buffer) on 1% agarose gel with 1:50000 SERVA DNA Stain G and gel was ran for 30min at 100V. No band visible on gel.
