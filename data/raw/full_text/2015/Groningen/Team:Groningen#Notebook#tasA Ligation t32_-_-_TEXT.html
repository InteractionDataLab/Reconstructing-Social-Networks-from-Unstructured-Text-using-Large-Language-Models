tasA Ligation with BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 (t32)
In this experiment tasA was ligated with BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation step of tasA with BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 was performed.
