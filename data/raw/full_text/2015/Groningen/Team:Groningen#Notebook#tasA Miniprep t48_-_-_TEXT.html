tasA Miniprep (t48)
Extract plasmid from E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The bacterial culture was miniprepped successfully.
Plasmid DNA purification
00:00, 18 July 2015 - 00:00, 18 July 2015
The culture of the colony that seemed to have the right insert at 17 July, was miniprepped and stored as 33 (17-1-15).
