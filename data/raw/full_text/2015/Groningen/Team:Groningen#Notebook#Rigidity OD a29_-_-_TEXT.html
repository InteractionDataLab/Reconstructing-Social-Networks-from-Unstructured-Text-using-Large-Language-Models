Rigidity_OD_a29
Testing the rigidity of the biofilm of two different Bacillus substilis strains, 3610 delta comI and BD 1807, based on OD values.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
The biofilm of BD1807 has a more rigid biofilm than 3610 delta comI.
00:00, 03 September 2015 - 00:00, 03 September 2015
In advance, 2 biofilms of BD1807 and 3610 delta comI strains were grown on Whatman carrier. Each carrier plus biofilm were weighed:
Weight of 3610 delta ComI biofilm plus carrier (in g)
1.023
1.151
Weight of BD1807 biofilm plus carrier (in g)
1.234
1.173
1 mL 0.7% NaCl was added on top of each carrier and biofilm, which formed a bubble.
1ml was removed from the bubble into a cuvet. Resuspend this 1 mL in the cuvet 6 times.
These two steps above were repeated multiple times for each carrier plus biofilm.
OD was measured for these samples:
OD of sample with loosened 3610 delta ComI culture #1.
OD of sample with loosened 3610 delta ComI culture #2.
0.004
0.001
0.004
0.002
OD of sample with loosened BD 1807 culture #1.
OD of sample with loosened BD 1807 culture #2.
0.001
0.000
0.003
0.002
The mean measured OD of 3610 delta ComI strains was 0.00275. This number was set as reference. The mean OD measured for BD 1807 was 0.002. This means that 28% less BD 1807 were loosened from the biofilm compared to 3610 delta comI 1-(0.002/0.00275)
