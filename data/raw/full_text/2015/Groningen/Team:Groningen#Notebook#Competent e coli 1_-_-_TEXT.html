Competent E. Coli 1
Competent E. coli cells were made.
To make competent E. coli cells.
A few red colonies on the 90% plate (± 22 colonies).

Transferred overnight culture in fresh LB (pre-warmed). 250 µL culture in 25 mL LB (1/100 dilution) and grown in shaker incubator at 37 °C, 220 rpm for 2 hours.
Used culture (OD: 0.24) for making competent cells (protocol Clement)
Tested competence of competent E. coli with Transformation efficiency kit (BBa_J04450, 50 pg/µL). Protocol: Heat Shock transformation (protocolbook).
1 µL of 50 pg/µL BBa_J04450
Plate on LB agar + CM:
10%  (10 µL)
90%  (90 µL)
