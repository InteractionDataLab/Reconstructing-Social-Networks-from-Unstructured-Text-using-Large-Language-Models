tasA PCR purification (t3)
A PCR purification was performed to get rid of the enzymes used in the PCR process.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The PCR product was purified.

The PCR products were PCR purified according to protocol. The PCR purification products of samples 3, 4 and 5 were stored in freezer at -20 °C as 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5.
