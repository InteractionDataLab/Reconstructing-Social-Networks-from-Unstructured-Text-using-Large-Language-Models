Presentation for Chemistry students
Today we went to our neighbours in the Chemistry building where Hanneke gave a talk to her fellow students about iGEM and our project. The study association of Chemistry and Chemical engineering invited us to give a talk for their members, so we did!  We noticed that iGEM wasn’t commonly known so first we talked about iGEM in general later on we talked about our project and the students were really interested. After the lecture we talked some more about all the aspects of iGEM, which parts Hanneke and Bente are responsible for in the project and about what we liked most about iGEM. They seemed to agree with us that one of the nicest parts is that you’re able to choose your own project!  We brought our card game, unfortunately we had no time to play it but the design was really appreciated.  At the we even got a gift! To keep up the working spirit in the office the board of the study association gave us candy and to open official envelopes we got a letter opener. Thanks to the board of the Chemistry association for inviting us and the nice gifts.
