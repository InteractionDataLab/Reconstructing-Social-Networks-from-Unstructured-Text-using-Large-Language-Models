Ligation tasA, Psalt in K823023 (t46)
In this experiment the salt promoter is ligated with tasA in the K823023 backbone.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation of tasA , Psalt and K823023 was performed.
