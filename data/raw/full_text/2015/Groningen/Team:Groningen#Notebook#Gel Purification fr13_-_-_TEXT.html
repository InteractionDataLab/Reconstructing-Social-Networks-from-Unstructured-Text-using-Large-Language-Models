Gel Purification pSB1C3 (fr13)
Gel purification of pSB1C3

Gel purification
18:30, 31 August 2015 - 20:00, 10 August 2015
Digestion products were loaded on 1% agarose gel to purify.
Sample:
20 µL DNA (pSB1C3).
4 µL 6x buffer.
Ladder:
2 µL Thermo Scientific GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, ready to use.
Gel was run on 100V for 30 minutes. Gel results show a band of 2000bp. This corresponds to the size of pSB1C3. Gel was cut and dissolved in 2:1 binding buffer of the PCR purification kit and purified according to protocol. Sample was stored as:pSB1C3 dig (6,2ng/µL, Nanodrop value).
