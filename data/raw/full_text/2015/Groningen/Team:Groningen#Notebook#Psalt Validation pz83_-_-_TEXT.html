Psalt Validation (pz83)
The salt inducible promotor was validated in two different ways. The first was growing biofilms with strains with the salt inducible promotor in front of three different gene combinations. The second was growing a biofilm with a ComI mutant with Psalt + tasA and staining it afterwards with a Thioflavin S staining.
To create a salt inducible promotor.
The salt inducible promotor works as can be seen in BBa_K1597000 .
