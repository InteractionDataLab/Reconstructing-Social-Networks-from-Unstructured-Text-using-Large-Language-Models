Colony PCR
17:00, 1 September 2015 - 21:00, 1 September 2015
Transformation was checked. On the plate were 5 white colonies visible. All these colonies were checked for the correct insert with a colony PCR. Each colony was taken from the plate and resuspended in 20 µL sterile MQ water. A Mastermix for 16 samples was made.

The samples were run on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G 1:50000. 5 µL of sample DNA was mixed with 1 µL 6x buffer. As a ladder 2 µL of the GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder was used. The gel was run for ∼30 minutes at 100 V. All five colonies have the correct insert size.
