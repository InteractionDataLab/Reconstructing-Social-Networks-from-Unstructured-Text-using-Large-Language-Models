tasA Purification (t76)
The digestion samples were purified to get rid of the restriction enzymes.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA and Psalt digestion products were gel purified.

Correct fragments were cut out of the gel and purified with the PCR purification kit.
