sinR_Plate_Natto_si19
Testing whether coffee filter carrier produces a biofilm of transformed Bacillus subtilis natto on LB and msGG plates.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Unknown, as the results are missing.
none

Transformed Bacillus subtilis natto was added to LB medium.
After 5 hours of incubation the optical density was measured: 0.124.
Before adding the coffee filters to msGG and LB plates, the filters were autoclaved and dried at 37 °C. Then the filters were placed in sterile water. This was to prevent the filters from drying out and to remove any wrinkles left by autoclaving.
Coffee filters were placed on the plates.
100 µL of culture was added to each plate with a coffee filter.
