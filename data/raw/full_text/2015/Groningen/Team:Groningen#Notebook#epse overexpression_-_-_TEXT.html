Contents of cups.
The cups were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. Then a Thermo Scientific purification kit was used on each cup.
Ligation
Competent cells (NEB5-alpha competent E. coli high efficiency) were defrosted. 10 µL of competent cells were pipetted in cup A and the cup was stirred using a pipet point. The cup was then put on ice. After leaving it on ice for 15 minutes the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 15 minutes. Subsequently, the mixture was placed on ice for 2 minutes. 900 µL of LB medium was added to the mixture and the cup was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed by pipetting and the pellet was resuspended with fresh medium. Finally, the mixture was put on LB kanamycin plates and left in the stove at 37 °C during the night.
The RBS was smaller than allowed by the DNA purification kit specifications, but colony pcr showed that this did not cause any problems.

The supernatant was removed by pipetting and the pellet was resuspended with fresh medium. Finally, the mixture was put on LB ampicillin plates and left in the stove at 37 °C during the night.
LB amp plates were accidently left in the refrigerator instead of being placed at 37 ° C one hour in advance. Therefore the competent cells were resuspended in suspernatant after centrifugation and placed in a 37 ° C  water bath for one extra hour while the LB amp plates were at 37 ° C.

colony pcr
Pcr was performed to see if  overexpression of epsE in B. subtilus was successful.
8 Eppendorf tubes were filled with 30 µL of demiwater each. An equal number of colonies were picked from the plate and suspended in the Eppendorf tubes. Then 8 pcr cups were filled with 48 µL mastermix and 2 µL of suspended bacteria each.
PCR results
? placed on 1% agarose gel. Band was not as high as expected, pveg promotor was missing.

Contents of cups used.
Cups were incubated at 37 °C for one hour. Then cup 1 was placed on ice and the contents of cup 2 were loaded on 1% agarose gel, which was then ran at 100v. The band height was checked after one hour and found to be around 3000 bps as expected. The band was cut from the gel and purified using a Thermo Scientific DNA purification kit.
In contrast to the protocol binding buffer was added to the gel in a 1:2 ratio. The sample was vortexed until the gel diluted in the buffer.

Transformation
Competent cells (NEB5-alpha competent E. coli high efficiency) were defrosted. 10 µL of cup 2+2 and cup 2+3 were mixed with 10 µL of competent cells.  The mix was stirred using a pipet point and subsequently put on ice. After 15 minutes on ice the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 15 minutes. The mixture was placed on ice for 2 minutes. 900 µL of LB medium was added to the mixture and the cup was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed by pipetting and the pellet was resuspended with fresh medium. Finally, the mixture was put on dried LB ampicillin plates and left in the stove at 37 °C during the night.
Several colonies were found. The promoters were in place in front of epsE. Unfortunately, the RBS was missing.

Before inserting promoters, the size of the miniprepped epsE plasmid was checked.
Cup 1 was filled with 10 µL ligated epse, RBS and kanamycin, 1µL EcoRI, 1µl XBAI, 2µL NEB 2.1 and 7 µL demiwater. This was left to rest for two hours in a 37 °C shaking bath. The contents of the cup were then placed on a 1% gel after being diluted with 4 µL of 6x loading buffer. The gel was ran at 100V for 30 minutes. No bands were seen.

Likely cause is that the sample was not miniprepped.
