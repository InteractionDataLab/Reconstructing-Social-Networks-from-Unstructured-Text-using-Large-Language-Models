Biology class for high school students
Today Marieke and Bente went to the Gomarus college in Groningen. We got the opportunity to tell the class something about synthetic biology, our project and iGEM. After a short introduction about who we are and what we came to do, Marieke told the class everything they needed to know about synthetic biology. After that i told something about iGEM and our project. They seemed really enthusiastic especially about our project. They already knew a lot about alternative energy sources which proved to us that alternative energy is a big topic in the Netherlands. At the end of the lesson they wished us luck with our project. Thank you Gomarus College for the time they gave us and the genuine attention of the kids!
