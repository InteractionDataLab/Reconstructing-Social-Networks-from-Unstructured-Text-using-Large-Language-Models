tasA Colony PCR (t102)
A colony PCR was performed to check for the right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Four colonies were PCR'ed and grown overnight.

Plates were checked for colonies. Plate with salt promoter in pSB1C3 contained colonies. 4 colonies were checked with colony PCR, therefore VF and VF2 primers were used.

PCR Thermocycle
Each transformation had at least one correct insert according to the PCR. This colony was grown in LB with corresponding antibiotics overnight at 37 °C.
