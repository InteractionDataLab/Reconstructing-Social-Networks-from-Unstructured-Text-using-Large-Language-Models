Testing our continuous flow reactor for submerged Bacillus subtilis PY79 biofilm growth onto nylon carrier. The continuous flow reactor circulates on one side of the reactor the medium, while circulating Bacillus subtulis PY79 on the other side. A  nylon carrier is placed between both compartments. The tubes of the continuous flow reactor pass an airpump and a water bath set at 40 °C.
Investigating Bacillus subtilis PY79 submerged biofilm growth.
Continuous flow reactor required additional adjustments for submerged biofilm growth.

Approximately 15 mL MSgg agar with ampicillin was poured in one compartment of the continuous flow reactor for submerged biofilm growth.
In the meanwhile 10 µL of Bacillus subtilis py79 was added to 2 mL LB.
Bacillus subtilis py79 resuspended in PBS was placed in the other compartment of the continuous flow reactor.
After running the loaded continuous flow reactor, it appeared that the air in the system was not refreshed once it was on. Furthermore, Bacillus subtilis PY79 growth was not on the carrier, but in the medium.
