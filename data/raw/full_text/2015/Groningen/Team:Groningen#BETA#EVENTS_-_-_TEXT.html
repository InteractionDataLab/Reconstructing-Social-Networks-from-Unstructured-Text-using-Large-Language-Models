Lecture, lab tour and card game for high school students
A group of 6 VWO students from the Celeanum gymnasium Zwolle had a day programme in and around our building with Science Linx. Luckily there was some time left to spend with us. So we could talk about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Maybe we have created some future iGEM members!
