tasA K823023 Ligation (t22)
In this experiment tasA was ligated with the K823023 backbone to make transformation possible.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The K823023 backbone was ligated with tasA.
