tasA Digestion (t37)
tasA plasmid was digested to check for right insert.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
On the gel 24TA 3 seemed to have the correct insert.
Restriction
00:00, 16 June 2015 - 00:00, 16 June 2015
The digestion of tasA of 15 June 2015 was repeated. The samples were digested for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Afterwards the samples were loaded on gel.
Sample:
10 µL digestion sample
2 µL 6x buffer
Ladder:
10 µL Quick-Load® Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder (0.1 - 10.0 kb)
A gel was run at 100 V for 1 hour. On the gel 24TA 3 seemed to have the correct insert.
