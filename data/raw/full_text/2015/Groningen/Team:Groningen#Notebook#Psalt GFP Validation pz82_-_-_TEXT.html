Psalt GFP Validation (pz812
The transformed B. subtilis was tested to check if the salt inducible promotor works by adding different salt concentrations.
To create a salt inducible promotor.
No fluorescent protein visible.

This was done by growing B. subtilis ComI in LB + chloramphenicol for four hours. Then cells were transferred to Spizizen salts medium (SSM) and grown for three additional hours.  Then different salt concentrations were added (0.1M, 0.5M and 1M).  This was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Afterwards cells were fixated in 1,25% agarose in PBS. Fluorescent microscopy did not show any differences between salt concentrations.
