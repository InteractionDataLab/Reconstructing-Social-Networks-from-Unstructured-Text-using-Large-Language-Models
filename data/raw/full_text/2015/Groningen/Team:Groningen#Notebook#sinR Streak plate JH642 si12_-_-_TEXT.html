sinR_Streak_plate_JH642_si12
Streaking the plate with transformed Bacillus subtilis JH642.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Streaking the plate succeeded as there were single colonies on the plate.
