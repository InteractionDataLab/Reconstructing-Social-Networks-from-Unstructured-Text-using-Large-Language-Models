tasA Assembly PCR (t6)
An assembly PCR was performed to assemble three pieces of tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The assembly PCR did not succeed.

A gel was run with the PCR products on 1% agarose gel with EtBr.
On the gel, for sample 3 two bands were visible, indicating that fragment 2.5 and 2.6 were not assembled. Sample 4 had no product, so also the PCR assembly of product 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 did not succeed.
