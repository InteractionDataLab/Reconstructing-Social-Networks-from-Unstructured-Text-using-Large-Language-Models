Psalt Transformation (zp33)
Transformation was done to introduce the ligated plasmid DNA into E. coli.
To create a salt inducible promotor.
Transformation success. Only colonies on pSB1C3 + Psalt plate not on the others.
Heat shock transformation
00:00, 17 Augsut 2015 - 00:00, 17 August 2015
Competent E. coli were transformed with 10 µL ligation product (tasA in pSB1C3 + Psalt, bslA in pSB1C3 + Psalt and pSB1C3 + Psalt) and plated on three different LB plates with chloramphenicol (pSB1C3). Transformation partially success. Only colonies visible on pSB1C3 plate with Psalt.
