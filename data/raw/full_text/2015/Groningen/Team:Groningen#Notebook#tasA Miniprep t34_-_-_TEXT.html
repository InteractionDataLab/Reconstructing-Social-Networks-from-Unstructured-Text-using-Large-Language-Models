tasA Miniprep (t34)
RFP and tasA DNA were isolated by miniprep.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
In this experiment tasA and RFP DNA were obtained from E. coli.
Plasmid DNA purification.

The colonies that were grown overnight were miniprepped, by eluting them in 50 µL and stored as 23RFP, 23TA, 24RFP, 24TA (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7).
