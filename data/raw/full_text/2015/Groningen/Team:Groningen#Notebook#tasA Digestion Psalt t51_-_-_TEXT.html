tasA Digestion Psalt (t51)
The salt promoter was digested to make ligation with tasA in the K823023 possible.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The digestion of the salt promoter was performed.
Restriction
00:00, 23 July 2015 - 00:00, 23 July 2015
For the ligation of Psalt, tasA and BBa_K823023, first the salt promoter (Psalt) had to be digested using EcoRI and SpeI as restriction enzymes. tasA and BBA_K823023 had been digested before already.
