Reaction master mix for Gibson assembly.
Each reaction 15 ul Gibson assembly mix + 5 ul DNA (2,5µL PGA 1 and 2,5µL PGA 2).
Both products were amplified was also directly used for bacillus transformation according to protocol ( 10 ul was used for transformation) PCR primers used: Prefix and suffix primers
