tasA Purification (t31)
In this experiment the restriction samples of tasA, BBa_K823023 & BBa_K823024 were purified.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The samples were purified.

00:00, 9 June 2015 - 00:00, 9 June 2015
The digestion samples were cleaned up with the PCR purification kit and eluted in 20 µL elution buffer. The purified samples were stored at -20 °C as:
tasA dig, 9-6-15.
23 dig, 9-6-15.
24 dig, 9-6-15.
