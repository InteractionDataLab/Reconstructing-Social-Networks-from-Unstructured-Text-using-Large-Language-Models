Measuring the membrane potential of BD 1807 biofilms grown on different carriers, which were placed on plates with different media.
To knock out abrB in Bacillus subtilis strains to obtain a more rigid biofilm. AbrB suppresses biofilm formation. Knocking out AbrB should result in a more rigid biofilm.
The BD 1807 biofilm with the highest membrane potential were grown on nylon carriers, which were placed on LB plates.
00:00, 16 Augustus 2015 - 00:00, 16 Augustus 2015
After 15 hours of growing in 37 °C incubator of 3610 delta comI with a abrB knockout on different carriers and media, their membrane potential were tested in the biof fuell cell. Salt and fresh water were created with 30 g/L and 1 g/L of NaCl, respectively.
The membrane potential of these biofilms are illustrated below:
Nylon #1
Nylon #2
