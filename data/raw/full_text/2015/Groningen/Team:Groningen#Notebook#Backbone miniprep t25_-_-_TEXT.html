Miniprep RFP backbone (t25)
Miniprep was performed to obtain the plasmid DNA (RFP backbone) from E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The RFP backbone was miniprepped.
Plasmid DNA purification
00:00, 01 May 2015 - 00:00, 01 May 2015
The E. coli culture was miniprepped (Thermo Scientific #K0502, lot: 00272723) and stored as: ‘RFP backbone’ in -20°C (50µL, 90ng/µL DNA).
