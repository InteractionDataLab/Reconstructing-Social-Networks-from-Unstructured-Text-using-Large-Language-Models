tasA sequencing (t38)
tasA was send for sequencing to Macrogen.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Indeed the restriction sites in tasA are gone.

24TA 3, one of the tasA digestion samples, was send to Macrogen for sequencing:
5µL 1/20 primer (5 pmol/µL)
5µL plasmid DNA (24TA 3)
Sequencing code Macrogen:
Forward primer (5 tasA for): 1790ZAB067
Reverse primer (6 tasA rev): 1790ZAB068

The seqencing results showed the tasA insert without restriction sites. The restriction sites are gone.
