IPTG induction of ferritin (fr11)
IPTG induction of the ferritin plasmid with IPTG inducible promoter
Development ferritin
IPTG induced ferritin showed a band around 42 kDa
IPTG induction
12:00, 11 September 2015 - 17:00, 12 September 2015
Ferritin was induced with IPTG to check for protein expression. This was loaded on SDS-PAGE gel to check for the correct protein. Band of approximately 42kD is clearly visible after IPTG induction as can be seen in figure 1. Expression of this protein works.

Results of the IPTG expression. The results clearly show a thick band at 42kD after IPTG induction. This corresponds with the size of the ferritin protein.
