Testing the k823023 (Munich backbone) plasmid by plating transformed Bacillus subtilis PY79. Successful k823023 transformation induces the production of a red fluorescent protein.
Investigating Bacillus subtilis PY79 submerged biofilm growth
k823023 transformation does not result in red colonies. Therefore, it is not suited for Bacillus Subtilis PY79 transformations.

11:35, 16 Augustus 2015 - 00:00, 16 Augustus 2015
The optical density of Bacillus subtilis PY79 was 0.92 after growing overnight.
200 µL of Bacillus subtilis PY79 culture was put on two LB chloramphenicol plates. These plates were put in the 37℃ incubator.
No red colonies were found on LB chloramphenicol plates after growing overnight.
