tasA Ligation product purification (t21)
In this experiment the ligation products of tasA with the BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 backbones were purified.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation products were purified.
