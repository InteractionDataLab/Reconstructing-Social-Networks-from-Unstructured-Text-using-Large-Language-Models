tasA Ligation (t58)
The digested samples were ligated to be transformed afterwards.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation of the promoters with tasA in K823023 was performed.
Ligation
09:30, 28 July 2015 - 16:00, 28 July 2015
After the digestion, the promoters were ligated into the backbones. For this a ligation Mastermix was made for four samples.
