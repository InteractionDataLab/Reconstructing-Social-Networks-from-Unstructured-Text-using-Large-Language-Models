tasA purification (t13)
Purify the tasA DNA after restriction.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The tasA DNA was purified.
PCR purification
00:00, 20 May 2015 - 00:00, 20 May 2015
The samples were digested for 2 hours at 37 °C. Afterwards the DNA was cleaned up with the PCR purification kit, and stored at -20 °C. The DNA was stored in 20 µL elution buffer.
Sample
Name
Plasmid
ligate RFP BB, digest prod 20-5-15
tasA
ligate tasA 4.2, digest prod 20-5-15
Storage information of purified PCR product.
NOTE: The next time a gel extraction must be done after digestion, as the RFP insert is too large to get rid of with the PCR purification kit.
