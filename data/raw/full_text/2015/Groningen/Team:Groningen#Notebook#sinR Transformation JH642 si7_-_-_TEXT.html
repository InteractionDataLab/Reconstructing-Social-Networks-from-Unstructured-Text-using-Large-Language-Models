sinR_Transformation_JH642_si7
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis JH642.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
The transformation had failed as no colonies were one the plate.
Transformation
10:00, 26 August 2015 - 00:00, 26 August 2015
Bacillus subtilis JH642 was added to LB at 10.00.
Afterwards the optical density of Bacillus subtilis JH642 was was measured: 0.216.
At 15:24 Bacillus subtilis JH642 was added to MC and the mixture was placed in the 37°C incubator.
At 20:24 1 µL of SinR plasmid was added to the MC mixture, which was placed back in the 37°C incubator.
At 23:00 the transformed Bacillus subtilis JH642 was plated.
