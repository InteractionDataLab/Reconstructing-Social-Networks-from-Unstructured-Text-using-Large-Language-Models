tasA Colony PCR (t66)
The colony PCR is performed to check the insert of the E.coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
On gel it was seen that two samples of the colony PCR possibly had the insert.
Colony PCR
00:00, 9 August 2015 - 00:00, 9 August 2015
The transformation of 7 August was checked. Some white colonies were visible. With these colonies a colony PCR was carried out. After the PCR the samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and it was seen that sample 3 and 7 possibly have the insert. Cultures were made of sample 3 and 7 by putting some of the bacteria in a tube with 3 mL LB+cm. The tubes were put in the shaking incubator at 37 °C with 200 rpm.
