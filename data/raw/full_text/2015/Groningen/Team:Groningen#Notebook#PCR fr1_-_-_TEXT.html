PCR ferritin construct (fr1)
Amplifying ferritin
Development of ferritin
Ferritin was amplified successfully
PCR
00:00, 31 Augustus 2015 - 00:00, 31 Augustus 2015
Ferritin was ordered with sequence with prefix and suffix primers from IDT. PCR was performed (Figure 1) using NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix with the prefix and suffix primers.

PCR Thermocycle.
The PCR prduct was loaded on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G (1:50000) and run for 1 hour on 100 V.
Sample:
1 µL DNA (ferritin).
1 µL 6x buffer.
4 µL \( \mathrm{H_2O}\).
Ladder:
2 µL Thermo Scientific GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, ready to use.
A band of approximately 1600 bp was visible on the gel. This corresponds to the size of ferritin.
