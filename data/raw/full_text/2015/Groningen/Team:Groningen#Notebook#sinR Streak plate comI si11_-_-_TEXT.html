sinR_Streak_plate_comI_si11
Streaking the plate with transformed Bacillus subtilis 3610 delta comI.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Streaking the plate succeeded as there were single colonies on the plate.
