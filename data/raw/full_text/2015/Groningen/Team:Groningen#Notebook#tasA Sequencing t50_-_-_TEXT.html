tasA Sequencing (t50)
The ligation product of tasA with Psalt in K823023 was checked by sending determining its sequence.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
Not the right insert. RFP was inserted instead of tasA.
