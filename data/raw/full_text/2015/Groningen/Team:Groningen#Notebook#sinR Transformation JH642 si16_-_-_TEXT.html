sinR_Transformation_JH642_si16
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis JH642.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
The transformation had suceeded as colonies were found on the plate.
Transformation
10:00, 27 August 2015 - 00:00, 27 August 2015
Bacillus subtilis JH642 was added to LB.
Standard competence medium was prepared.  10 µL of phenylalanine was added to Bacillus subtilis JH642 mixture.
Bacillus subtilis JH642 was added to MC and the mixture was placed in the 37°C incubator at 13:00.
At 18:00 1 µL of SinR plasmid was added to the MC mixture, which was placed back in the 37°C incubator.
At 21:00 200µL transformed Bacillus subtilis JH642 was plated on spectinomycin plate.
