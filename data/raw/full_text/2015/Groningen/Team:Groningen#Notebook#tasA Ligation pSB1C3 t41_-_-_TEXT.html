tasA ligation pSB1C3 (t41)
The ligation of tasA in pSB1C3 to make the transformation in E. coli possible.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
tasA was ligated into pSB1C3.
