iGEM Aix Marseile
We helped the iGEM team of Aix Marseille with their survey on chewing gum. They awarded us with a gold medal badge because we submitted more than 30 surveys!

iGEM TU Delft
During the national meetup in the Netherlands, the iGEM team from TU Delft told about their plans of building a 3D biofilm printer. Our project is about an ion-selective biofilm so we decided to collaborate. When the K’NEX 3D printer was ready Anne and Marit from the iGEM Delft team travelled to Groningen to test if they could print with our B. subtilis 3610 comI. It was indeed seen that their 3D printer also worked with B. subtilis, using a mixture of bacteria in alginate, with using calcium chloride for polymerisation. As alginate is negatively charged, we decided to expand the experiment to also test the printed biofilm in our test device to test its selectivity for sodium ions. We tested the printed layer in our setup, but unfortunately the layer was not able to block water, making it impossible to measure a reliable value for the potential.
iGEM Linkoping
This iGEM team asked us to sing part of their Human Practices iGEM song, which would be used to create a iGEM song with all the participating teams. We submitted the first part of the song! The result should be visible on the Jamboree.
Mexico
TecCEM HS asked for our help since they had problems getting their ordered DNA through customs. The DNA sequence for ferritin was ordered at IDT and ligated into the pSB1C3 backbone which then was transformed into E. coli. Their construct has an IPTG inducible promoter which was tested by IPTG induction. The SDS-page gel has shown that the protein is expressed when adding IPTG. This confirms that the construct works.
Results of the IPTG expression. The results clearly show a thick band at 42kD after IPTG induction. This corresponds with the size of the ferritin protein.
