tasA PCR (t4)
PCR was performed to amplify tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
On gel, it was seen that the correct bands were not present.

PCR Results.
Sample 7 should have showed a band at ± 850 bp and sample 8 at ± 950 bp, but as this was not observed, the product was discarded. In sample 1 still genomic DNA was present. For further PCR experiments, a gelpurification of the PCR product was done to get rid of the genomic DNA. Sample 1 was discarded, as it had no use in further experiments.
