sinR_Transformation_Natto_si17
Transformation of plasmid with SinR to overexpress SinR in Bacillus subtilis natto.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Transformation succeeded, as colonies were found on the plate.
Transformation
13:08, 29 August 2015 - 00:00, 29 August 2015
Bacillus subtilis natto was added to LB .
Bacillus subtilis natto was added to MC and the mixture was placed in the 37°C incubator.
At 18:00 1 µL of SinR plasmid was added to the MC mixture, which was placed back in the 37°C incubator.
Plated transformed Bacillus subtilis natto on LB with spectinomycin.
