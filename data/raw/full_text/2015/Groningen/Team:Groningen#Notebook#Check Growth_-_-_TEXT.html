PCR Thermocycle.
The PCR prduct was loaded on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G (1:50000) and run for 1 hour on 100 V.
Sample:
1 µL DNA (bslA).
1 µL 6x buffer.
4 µL \( \mathrm{H_2O}\).
Ladder:
2 µL Thermo Scientific GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, ready to use.
Band of approximately 600bp was visible on the gel. This corresponds to the size of bslA.

Digestion products were loaded on 1% agarose gel to purify.
Sample:
20 µL DNA (bslA).
4 µL 6x buffer.
Ladder:
2 µL Thermo Scientific GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, ready to use.
Gel was run on 100V for 30 minutes. Gel results show a band in sample 1 of 600bp and in sample 2 a band of 2000bp. This corresponds to the size of bslA and pSB1C3. Gel was cut and dissolved in 2:1 binding buffer of the PCR purification kit and purified according to protocol. Samples were stored as: bslA dig (10,1ng/µL, Nanodrop value) and: pSB1C3 dig (6,2ng/µL, Nanodrop value).

Ligation product (30µL) was transformed into 10µL NEB DH5 alpha competent cells. Cells were plated on LB + chloamphenicol agar plates.
Harm Ruesink
17:00, 1 September 2015 - 21:00, 1 September 2015
Transformation was checked. On the plate were 10 white colonies visible. All these colonies were checked for the correct insert with a colony PCR. Each colony was taken from the plate and resuspended in 20 µL sterile MQ water. A Mastermix for 16 samples was made.

The samples were run on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G 1:50000. 5 µL of sample DNA was mixed with 1 µL 6x buffer. As a ladder 2 µL of the GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder was used. The gel was run for ∼30 minutes at 100 V. All ten colonies have the correct insert size.

21:30, 1 September 2015 - 10:00, 2 September 2015
One colony was grown overnight in liquid LB + chloramphenicol at 37°C in a shaker incubator at 200rpm.

A 50% glycerol stock was made from 500µL culture and stored at -80°C.
Harm Ruesink
11:00, 2 September 2015 - 12:00, 2 September 2015
2,5mL of culture was miniprepped and stored at -20°C as: bslA (16,7ng/µL, Nanodrop value). Sample was sent in for sequencing and has the correct suffix.
