tasA Transformation (t33)
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
In this experiment the heat shock transformation of tasA with BBa_K823023 and BBa_K823024 was performed.
Heat shock transformation
00:00, 9 June 2015 - 00:00, 9 June 2015
Afterwards competent E.coli was transformed with the ligation products. A heat shock transformation was used. The cultures were plated on LB+amp plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. They were labeled as:
100% comp E. coli with 23 lig
100% comp E. coli with 24 lig

The transformation was checked. One white colony was visible on the 23 lig plate and 7 colonies were visible on the 24 lig plate. The colonies were grown overnight in LB+amp at 37 °C, 200 rpm.
