tasA Colony PCR (t73)
The colony PCR is performed to check the insert of the E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The gel of the colony PCR showed no right inserts.
Colony PCR
00:00, 17 August 2015 - 00:00, 17 August 2015
A colony PCR with 6 colonies of the T2+PliaG plate was done. Each colony was taken from the plate and resuspended in 20 µL sterile MQ water. A Mastermix for 16 samples was made.

PCR thermocycle.
The samples were run on a 1% agarose gel with DNA stain G 1:50000. 5 µL of sample DNA was mixed with 1 µL 6x buffer. As a ladder 1 µL of the GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder was used. The gel was run for ∼30 minutes at 100 V. No correct PCR product was visible on the gel. All bands are at the same height as the control (T2 without promoter).
