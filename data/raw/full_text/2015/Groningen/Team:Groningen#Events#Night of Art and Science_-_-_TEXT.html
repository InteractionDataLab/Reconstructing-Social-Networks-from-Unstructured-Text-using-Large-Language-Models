Night of Art and Science
The Night of Art and Science was held in Groningen for the sixth time in the past six years. The edition of this year was organised by the Groninger forum. The aim of this night is to give people the chance to amaze themselves by the unique combination of art and science at different special locations at the citycenter of Groningen. Our location for the night was the Minverva Acedemie building, by day the art students have classes over here but tonight it was our stage. Together with prof.dr. Gert-Jan Euverink we talked about synthetic biology. He is an expert on biotechnology and watertechnology. And also a very captivating speaker, he really impresses the crowd with his talk. It was a really fun night with lots of interesting questions from the audience. Our first official outreach activity is a fact!
