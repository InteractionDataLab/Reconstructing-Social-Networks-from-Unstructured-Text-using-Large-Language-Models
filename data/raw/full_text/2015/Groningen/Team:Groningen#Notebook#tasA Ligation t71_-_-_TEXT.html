tasA Ligation PliaG (t71)
The PliaG promoter was ligated with tasA to regulate TasA overexpression.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The ligation of the PliaG promoter with tasA was performed.
Ligation
10:30, 13 August 2015 - 20:15, 13 August 2015
The samples were ligated overnight at room temperature.
