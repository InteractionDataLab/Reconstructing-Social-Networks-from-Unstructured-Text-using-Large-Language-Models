tasA PCR (t2)
PCR was performed to amplify tasA.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The experiment was carried out successfully.

PCR Results.
As the product at ± 700 bp was not that clearly visible, the PCR was repeated.
