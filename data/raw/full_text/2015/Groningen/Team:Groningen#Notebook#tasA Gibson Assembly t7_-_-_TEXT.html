tasA Gibson Assembly (t7)
A Gibson assembly was performed to assemble the PCR products of the tasA gene.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The Gibson assembly was performed.

For the Gibson assembly, DNA was used with the concentrations indicated in Table 1. The concentration in the second column is the concentration of DNA based on the gel. The concentrations listed in column 3 are obtained by using Nanodrop.
