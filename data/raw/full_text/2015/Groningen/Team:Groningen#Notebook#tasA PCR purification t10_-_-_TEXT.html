tasA PCR purification (t10)
In this experiment the PCR products were purified.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The PCR products were purified.
