Blue Bio Energy Branding
Blue Bio Energy stands for sustainability, organic biology and innovation to bring biology and technology even closer together.
Organicity and landscapes of nature where houses and other objects blend into nature put more power on the sustainability sense. The layered and strong separation of colour transition tactically embrace the more formal and ordered ambience, this also helps us express the harmony of technology and biology respectively inorganic human made and "organicity".
Logo
The logo evolved from a complicated sharpened, organic and playish look to a more simplified serious and abstract design. The blue colour represents the water surrounding the green coloured biofilm, here green is associated with nature and biology. The arrow suggests movement of an ion through the membrane with the yellow colour representing the energy that can be generated by this process.
Presentation
Joy, innovation, motivation and  seriousness are words that contain semblance and perspective to the root message of Blue Bio Energy and in general iGEM. Limited use of words within each slides provide sense to clarity and innovation. Using a larger font size to emphasise meaning and respectfully ignoring alignment consistency, allows for a finish towards joy and motivation, while fully reserved slides for data and graphs on results or test settings without any style incorporated keeps tendency to seriousness. All these considerations trigger moods to embrace these previously named values.
Colours
Happy but still harmonically and slightly flattened colours are used to find a balance between the serious look, yought of innovation and spontaneity. It was decided to pick colours approaching the colours of dirt, grass, a blueish sky, water, rocks and yellows of the sun to obtain the organic and natural look. Putting some expression on the grassy and watery colours makes sure the message of sustainability is brought forward.
Style
Smooth edges, asymmetry and rugosity of shapes give notion to an organic feel. The formality and seriousness are achieved by the use of sharp corners to express a little feel of order and discontinuity associated with the word abstract.
Using strong and fine separation of sections on the cards basic layout enacts a clear and relaxed touch, highlighting the important parts and information on the card help the player feel more at ease and relaxed while reading or scanning the cards.
Images
A small amount of discontinuous gradient levels help keep the three dimensional and serious feel, but in the same way give playfulness to themages. The smooth edges and absence of sharp corners give a strong impression of organicity, this is mostly applied to cards concerning chemical reactions, cell structures or symbioses of bacteria. On the other hand the application of applying strong discontinuities and sharp corners will help to express technology in its raw form, specifically for cards about technology or methods.
Keeping the colours used in the branding of Blue Bio Energy emphasises and connects with the core values of “Blue Bio Energy” and its identity.
