Preparing Bacillus Nato strains for membrane potential measurement. In this experiment coffee filters (cellulose) are used as carrier and LB and msGG are used as medium.
To investigate the effect of high levels PGA in the biofilm on membrane potential

Bacillus natto was further prepared for membrane potential measurement. After 5 hours of incubation time the optical density was measured. The optical density of Bacillus natto (10 times diluted in demiwater) is 0.127.
Afterwards, 100 µL of culture was added to a piece of (cellulose) coffee filter, which was placed on either a msGG or LB plate. In advance, the coffee filters were autoclaved and then dried at 37 °C. Before placing the coffee filters on msGG and LB plates (two of each), the filters were wetted in sterile water to prevent the plates from becoming too dry. In addtion, the wetting also removed any wrinkles left by autoclaving on the filters.
