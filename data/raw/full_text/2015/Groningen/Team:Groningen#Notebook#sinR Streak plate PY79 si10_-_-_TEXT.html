sinR_Streak_plate_PY79_si10
Streaking the plate with transformed Bacillus subtilis PY79.
Overexpression of SinR in the Bacillus subtilis strains. This was done to overexpress matrix genes in the strains, which should result in an increased robustness of their biofilm.
Streaking the plate failed as there were no colonies on the plate.
