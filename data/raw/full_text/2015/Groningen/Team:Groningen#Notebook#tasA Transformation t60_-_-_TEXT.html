tasA Heat shock transformation (t60)
In this experiment tasA with two different promoters is transformed in E. coli.
Our goal is to overexpress TasA by adding a second copy of the tasA gene under the control of a salt inducible promoter. This overexpression will lead to a stronger biofilm when the biofilm is exposed to salt water.
The heat shock transformation was performed but no colonies were visible after growing overnight.

10:00, 29 July 2015 - 12:00, 29 July 2015
With the ligation product of tasA with two promoters of 28 July, the heat shock transformation was performed and the culture was plated on an LB+cm plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

The transformation of 29 July was checked. No colonies were visible on the LB+cm plate. T2 was send to Macrogen for sequencing.
