Colegio_EmelinaU, San_Andres and Liceo_Eugenio_Hostos iGEM Teams from Santiago, Chile
We were visited by Ana Sifuentes, Manager of iGEM’s Teams for Latin America. Her visit was very enriching because permitted us to meet with other Chilean iGEM Teams (High School) and we could know what facts are important to have a good iGEM experience. She talked about her experience in iGEM like manager and as a past member of a team. Her contribution for our team was clear and effective; it allowed us having a know how for each activity in iGEM Jamboree and Boston. Also, it allowed improving our project image face to institutional sponsors.
Also, the High School teams visited the laboratory installation of CeBiB to work a week in their projects.
UAndes iGEM Team from Bogotá, Colombia
We visited iGEM UAndes Team. It was a valuable opportunity to extend our project toward other countries. In that occasion, we presented them our project, the difficulties we had to face and how we solved them.
Korea_U_Seoul iGEM Team from Seul, Korea
This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice. They developed an online software that allows synthetic biologists to design their own biological device or path. They usually based their work in wet laboratory, but this year participated under the ‘Software tract’ being a huge challenge. Team Korea U Seoul believes that open data, open source software, and open access will definitely help researchers in the fields of biological sciences and we think it too.
TecCEM_HS iGEM Team from Monterrey, Mexico
We want to really thank to TECCEM-HS iGEM team for its collaboration in our crowdfunding campaing we made on Jun-Jul. Your donation contribute us to fund our total team costs to achieve the attendance of 9 of 11 team members to iGEM Jamboree at Boston . Thanks!
Stockholm iGEM Team from Stockholm, Sweden
This team invited us to participate in a survey for their policies and practices work for researching how reporting of results is viewed in the iGEM community to discuss the concept of negative results; a negative result is one that indicates that your system does not work as you intended. Also they wanted to investigate the experience iGEM teams have had with reading older wikis this 2015 as a source of inspiration. The team was very worried about how scientists and iGEM teams emphasize some parts of a project and play down others to its convenience, occulting important information about a negative results that could be useful to other, for example, to next iGEM teams.
This survey incentive us to include a section of negative results in our wiki as a valuable report to a next iGEM team of our university; we are the first one!
Nankai iGEM Team from Tianjin, China
This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice, where they hope to set up an all-round resource sharing platform called iShare. The survey had only 11 questions on the questionnaire. Its principal motivation was during the summer, where they ran into many problems working on their experiments. The lack of materials was one of the major difficulties for they, who had to acquire those materials from other laboratories. So they suggest a special webpage or a section on wiki for iGEM teams to list the materials they use in their experiments they are willing to share.
We had some similar problems when our enzyme digestion (EcoRI, SpeI) was lost. We guess this platform could be very useful to guide new teams. It had been helpful to us if this platform would have been implemented before.
