A sustainable initiative is to produce biodegradable plastics; however its synthesis process (chemical and biological) is complex and expensive. The team UChile-OpenBio designed two populations of bacteria to achieve this: the  team will use Escherichia coli to produce a biodegradable plastic called PLA (Polylactic acid) from easy to assimilate renewable resources. The first population will convert glucose into lactate and will self-regulate its production by sensing the pH. The second population will polymerize lactate into PLA and will export it into the medium. In addition the team is planning to replace the glucose by Chilean brown macroalgae (kelp), a renewable resource to sustainably produce PLA. In this way, the team would help fighting against pollution, contributing to a better world! </P></ARTICLE></DIV></SECTION><ARTICLE><DIV class="division"><DIV class="half"><H1>General Concepts</H1><P>A genetic module is constituted of 4 elements, called parts, that are DNA sequences which possess a specific function: the promotor, the RBS, the coding sequence and the terminator.</P><P>The role of a genetic module is to produce certain quantity of a protein under some specific conditions.

                            When being outside the cells, lactate acidifies the medium, which is dangerous for the bacteria. That’s why a pH-sensing module has been built to detect pH levels and produce the TetR protein when the pH is lower than 5.5.

                            TetR is a repressor of the lactate production module. It means, when pH becomes lower than 5.5, the lactate production is shut off by TetR. This shrinks the lactate concentration in the medium so that the pH increases again.
