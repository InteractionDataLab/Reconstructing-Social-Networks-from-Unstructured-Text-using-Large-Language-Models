UChile-Openbio iGEM team
The team consists of 14 members and is a multidisciplinary, collaborative & nonprofit group. It was funded in 2013, by students of Universidad de Chile. The team’s main objective is to boost SynBio in Chile through the Open Source Philosophy.
Severine
Name: Séverine Cazaux
Occupation: Studies Engineering in Biotechnology
iGEM work: Human Practices
Likes to (hobbies): Travel around the world
Description: She is a punctual and meticulous woman, she always smiles to you :) Almost ever support anyone who needs. She really loves to travel(now she is not with us :C ) and she likes dirty jokes :o 1313

iGEM work: Modelling
Likes to (hobbies): make rubik cubes
Description: She is a organized girl. She is very good to host different events. It is very diplomatic to communicate herself and also is very worried about the animal life
iGEM favorite moment: When mathematical model works
Hector
Name: Hector Ampuero
Occupation: Student of Chemical Engineering
iGEM work: Design and construction of bioreactor for the project.
iGEM favorite moment: Tito also helped us on fundraising by selling a beverage called "Terremoto" (earthquake in english) on different places. That's why we named Terremotito. It is funny because in Chile we usually add to the words the suffix ito/ita just because, and it fixed perfectly.

Diego
Name: Diego Lagos
Occupation: Ms. on Chemical Engineer
iGEM work: Diego is the nerd of the team: his job was to encode the wiki content designed by Natalia to make it visible for everyone.
Description: Diego is always ready to explain anything to anyone and makes sure that he was understood. As a Magister Student, he wants undergrade students to know the overgrade's world by opening lectures to the undergraduated. In his view, collaboration is a central value, for he encouraged the formation of the Synthetic Biology Platform and brought a lawyer to help deciding which kind of organization this platform would convert into.
Likes to (hobbies): He must like biking since he always get to the lab in bike!
Luis
Name: Luis Rodríguez Hernández
Occupation: Studies Engineering in Biotechnology
iGEM work: General coordinator
Likes to (hobbies): eating and participate in various organized groups
Description: He is the best principal coordinator we could have had! He is always concerned about us and the progress of the project, and destined most of his time to make our group a great team. He really cares about the environment and needlessly waste material so much when SUFE should be thrown away so many points in the laboratory.
iGEM favorite moment: When he realized that the entire team could travel to U.S.A
Ignacio
Name: Ignacio Ardiles
Occupation: Studies Industrial Engineering
iGEM work: Financial issues
Likes to (hobbies): He likes doing sports and to appreciate nature.
Description: He likes to record videos of our activities.
