Her visit was <SPAN class="destacado">very enriching</SPAN> because permitted us to meet with <SPAN class="destacado">other Chilean iGEM Teams</SPAN> (High School) and we could know what facts are important to have a good iGEM experience. She talked about her experience in iGEM like manager and as a past member of a team.

Also they wanted to investigate the experience iGEM teams have had with reading older wikis this 2015 as a source of inspiration. The team was very worried about how scientists and iGEM teams emphasize some parts of a project and play down others to its convenience, occulting important information about a negative results that could be useful to other, for example, to next iGEM teams.</P><P class="izquierda_60"><SPAN class="destacado">This survey incentive us to include a section of negative results in our wiki</SPAN> as a valuable report to a next iGEM team of our university; <SPAN class="destacado">we are the first one!</SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="half last"><H2 id="Nankai"> Nankai iGEM Team from Tianjin, China</H2><P>This team invited us to participate in a survey as a part of his human practice, where <SPAN class="destacado">they hope to set up an all-round resource sharing platform called iShare</SPAN>. The survey had only 11 questions on the questionnaire. Its principal motivation was during the summer, where they ran into many problems working on their experiments. The lack of materials was one of the major difficulties for they, who had to acquire those materials from other laboratories. So they suggest a special webpage or a section on wiki for iGEM teams to list the materials they use in their experiments they are willing to share.</P><P class="izquierda_60">We had <SPAN class="destacado">some similar problems</SPAN> when our enzyme digestion (EcoRI, SpeI) was lost. We guess this platform <SPAN class="destacado">could be very useful to guide new teams</SPAN>. It had been helpful to us if this platform would have been implemented before.</P></DIV></DIV></ARTICLE></SECTION><FOOTER><H1>Our Sponsors</H1></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
