members began to contact institutions that could write their letters
of interest to us. We collected a total of 6 letters of interest<B><SPAN style="color:#CC0000">David Sepulveda</SPAN></B> brought the following letters
(1) Leandro Valencia, La Ruta Solar.

Finally, <B><SPAN style="color:#CC0000">Noemi Miranda</SPAN></B> helped us with 1 letter
(1) Marcelo Mena Carrasco, Undersecretary Ministry of Environment

The choice of platform was made for three main reasons.
1. One of the creators of the platform came from Mexico in 2014 to present our university and we considered that it was a great and effective platform.
2. The platform has good payment methods, such as Web-pay or transfers that are well accepted by the people of our country.
3. The platform has offices in Chile which facilitates our direct communication.
The Campaign started on 16 of June on 2015. After that we strive to spread the campaign on our networks with different messages, banners and other kind of posts.
