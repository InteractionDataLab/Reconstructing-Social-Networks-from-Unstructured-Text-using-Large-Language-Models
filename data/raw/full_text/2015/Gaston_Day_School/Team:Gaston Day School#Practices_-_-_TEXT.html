Human Practices
     We strive to promote human practices within our community and for our project in the long run. Over the summer, the Gaston Day iGEM team offered a week-long camp dedicated to iGEM and the biomedical and bioengineering fields to allow students to understand what the project entails and how genetically engineered organisms function. The camp was run by team coach Anne Byford and co-led by team leader Claire Lamadrid. In addition to the camp, teachers from other schools visited our lab space to understand how they can incorporate the methods we used to their classrooms. Teachers came from multiple parts of the state as well as the local area.
     Every year, our school holds a Fall Fest, a community event with wide participation from families and the business community. This year, the Gaston Day iGEM team will have a booth designed to educate students, parents, and anyone interested in synthetic biology, genetically engineered organisms, safety practices common to the industry, and specifically our construct.
