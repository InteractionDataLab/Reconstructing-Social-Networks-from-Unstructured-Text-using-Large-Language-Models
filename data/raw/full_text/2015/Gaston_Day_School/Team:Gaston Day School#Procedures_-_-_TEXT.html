Procedure and Results
     To test the cadmium detector, use this procedure. Place 100 microliters of  E.coli control cells into 11 test tubes that each already contain four milliliters of LB broth. Also, place 100 microliters of cadmium detector cells into 11 more test tubes that each already contain four milliliters of LB broth. Into the tubes with the cadmium detector cells, add four microliters of chloramphenicol. Add cadmium chloride to tubes according to this chart:

     Leave in a shaking incubator overnight. Remove tubes from incubator and centrifuge for roughly five minutes to pellet. Pour off supernatant and re-suspend in four milliliters of 1x PBS. Pour one milliliter of each tube into one milliliter cuvettes and use a spectrometer to read the absorbance and fluorescence.
