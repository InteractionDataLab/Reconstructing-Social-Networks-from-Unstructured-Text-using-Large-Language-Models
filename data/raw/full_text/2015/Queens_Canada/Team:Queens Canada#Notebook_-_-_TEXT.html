LAB NOTEBOOK
On this page we have documented our lab work and have divided it all into three components, by the construct being generated:
AFP-E coil
Circularized Antifreeze Protein
Scaffold-K coil
Antifreeze Protein - E coil
DAY
TASK
OUTCOME
June 1st
Plated E. coli with Type III AFP donated by Dr. Davies and incubated overnight
Very few Type 3 AFP colonies
June 2nd
Prepared O/N cultures of Type 3 AFP
June 3rd
Mini-prepped wtAFP - Concentration of DNA measured with NanoDrop  - Annealed E-coil oligonucleotides
June 4th
Digested wtAFP backbone treated with SAP - wtAFP run on agarose to verify linearization - Performed XhoI digest
Unsuccessful: SAP likely degraded backbone too much/reaction allowed to proceed for too long
June 5th
Digested wtAFP backbone, treated with SAP
June 8th
Ligated annealed E-coil oligos into digested wtAFP plasmid with vector: oligo ratios 2:1, 1:1, and 2:3 - Plated wtAFP cells.
June 9th
(-) Control plate had highest colony count; shouldn’t have any - (+) Control had a few colonies - Experimental plates had a few colonies
June 10th
Inoculated 10 colonies from the 2:1 plate to ON cultures with Amp
June 11th
Colony PCR'd liquid cultures of AFP-Ecoil colonies, and ran 2% agarose gels with PCR products and 100bp DNA ladder
Unsuccessful insertion of oligos
June 15th
Digests were attempted yet again, then SAP treatment -> transformation
Successful: colonies present
June 16th
Colony screening was done through colony PCR
unsuccessful: colony PCR failed
June 22nd
Attempted insertion of oligos once more, this time with gel extraction of bands after XhoI digestion
June 26th
Ligation attempt - Ligated cells plated on Amp
Only successful plate was wtAFP without E-coil - Seems to be nuclease contamination degrading plasmid
July 2nd
Again, digestion-extraction-ligation protocol performed (this time treated vectors qithout SAP).
Successful: colonies present,picked MANY to find right one
July 3rd
XhoI digest for wtAFP-E coil plate for colony screening
Successful: certain colonies appear to have an insert - sent for sequencing to confirm the coil is in the right orientation; successful!
August 4th
MTransformed correct AFP-E coil into BL21 cells for protein expression
Successful: colonies present
August 11th
Made 2L of AFP E-coil cells
August 12th
Lysed AFP E-coil cells and kept the sup overnight in the cold room (for ice-affinity purification tomorrow) - ran SDS-PAGE of the TCL/sup/pellet to confirm overexpression/solubility of the AFP-Ecoil protein
August 13th
Did one round of ice-affinity purification to confirm that the AFP-E.coil fusion can still bind to ice - ran SDS-PAGE of sup, liquid fraction 1, ice fraction 1
The AFP appeared to bind to ice, but we let the crystal grow too large and a bunch of other proteins were incorporated into the ice fraction too - will do another round of ice-affinity tomorrow to further purify
August 14th
Ran a second round of ice-affinity purification, starting with the ice fraction from the first round - Ran an SDS-PAGE of the sup, ice/liquid fractions 1, ice/liquid fractions 2
Successful! It appears that the AFP-E coil bound to ice well in the second ice-affinity purification; much better separation!
Circularized AFP (Icefinity)

July 8th
Protein expression;  then attempted ice affinity purification - Ran on SDS-PAGE
Unsuccessful: appears to be no protein expressed
July 10th
Careful troubleshooting and review of plasmid sequence
Identified problem pSB1C3 has no T7 promoter sequence… unable to express protein.
July 14th - 17th
Insert containing AFP-linker-extein was PCR amplified
PCR successful: amplicon band of correct size is visible
July 22nd
Digested both the vector and insert with Not1 and Xba1
July 23rd
Digests were then ligated then transformed in electrocompetent Topten E.coli K12 cells.
Successful insertion of insert into our promoter-containing vector.
July 28th
colonies were chosen, DNA purified, then digested with Not1 and Xba1 to confirm correct insertion size
