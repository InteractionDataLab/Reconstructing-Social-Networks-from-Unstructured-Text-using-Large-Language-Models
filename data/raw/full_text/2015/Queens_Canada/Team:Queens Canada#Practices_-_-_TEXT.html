HUMAN PRACTICES
This summer the QGEM team delved into the policy and practice of our project! We integrated our work in the lab by exploring three facets of human practices: Academics, Community Outreach, and Intellectual Property. Throughout the summer, we managed to tie all of our work into a common theme: cross-disciplinary education. Participating in iGEM is an amazing opportunity to apply your knowledge and learn valuable skills in a cross-disciplinary manner. Through academic and community outreach, as well as IP work, we worked to emphasize the importance of integrating various subjects to create a more wholesome learning experience.
