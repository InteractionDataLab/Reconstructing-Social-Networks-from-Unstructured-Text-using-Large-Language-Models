TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON:
AFPs for LIFE
We planned our Ice Queen with one main application in mind: improving the cryopreservation technique for organ storage. Currently, the heart can only be stored at about 4 degrees celsius for at most 6 hours. By attempting to improve antifreeze protein activity with the Ice Queen, we can diminish ice growth and keep donated hearts viable for much longer! By increasing storage times, we hope to save more lives with organ transplant surgeries. Click here to learn more!
