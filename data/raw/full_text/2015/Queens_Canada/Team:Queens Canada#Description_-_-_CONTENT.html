Our project this year focused on the topics of organ donation and transplantation surgeries as well as the challenges surrounding these procedures. Each year, thousands are affected by the constant struggle to find organs for people in need, and we wanted to see if science could come to the rescue! </P><P>The demand for organs for transplantation has been steadily increasing as waiting lists become longer and longer.  Over 1600 Canadians are added to the organ wait list every year.<SUP>1</SUP> Figure 1 illustrates how over the years the gap between the number of people on organ wait lists and the number of donors has been steadily increasing.</P><FIGURE style="width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1.<STRONG>Number of people waiting for an organ in relation to number of donors  and transplants performed over time.</STRONG>Data taken from the US Department of Health and Human Services and numbers are for the USA only.<SUP>2</SUP> **Data includes deceased and living donors.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>However, organ shortage appears to only to be one of the challenges to transplant medicine. To effectively tackle this problem, we had to understand the full picture. Along with the increasing demand for organs, we also face inadequate organ preservation methods, limiting the amount of time an organ can be stored for transplantation. This creates a very small window of time for officials to find a compatible recipient for the organ.<SUP>3</SUP> Because of this limiting timespan, organ rejection and incompatibility generates another large problem in the organ transplant field. This leads to the loss of a significant number of organs that become non-viable after harvest.</P><FIGURE style="width: 300px; float: right;"><FIGCAPTION>The image above from the Wisconsin State Journal shows a surgical coordinator storing an organ on ice with a perfusion pump containing UW solution.<SUP>4</SUP></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>The development of new organ storage and tissue preservation methods for transplantation has been a point of interest in research for over 50 years, and techniques including cryopreservation have greatly improved. Current storage methods involve bringing the organ down to cool temperatures, slowing cell metabolism and storing the organ for a certain amount of time. Storage involves the use of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, a cold storage solution containing solutes at optimal osmotic concentrations. UW also uses metabolically inert substances to maintain this concentration which is ideal for organ storage. The kidney and liver for example, can be successfully preserved with UW for 24-36 hours. Other organs such as the heart and lungs can only be stored for about 6 hours.<SUP>5</SUP></P><P>QGEM this year decided to help improve transplant medicine by working to solve the organ storage problem. We want to ameliorate preservation techniques by using a method that is already found and used effectively in nature by various organisms: antifreeze proteins. </P></DIV><DIV id="projectcomponents" style="padding: 20px 200px 20px 200px;"><H2>The Ice Queen</H2><P>This summer, our team chose to investigate AFPs and explore their potential application in cryopreservation. Our AFP of choice was the type III protein from the ocean pout fish. Our central project focused on optimizing antifreeze activity by anchoring multiple AFPs to a self-assembling protein scaffold. Our AFP-scaffold complex, affectionately termed the Ice Queen, sets out to increase the local concentration of AFPs, enabling more favourable interactions between proteins and ice crystal surfaces.<SUP>6</SUP> These interactions slow down the ice recrystallization process by depressing the freezing point, a concept termed thermal hysteresis. </P><P>The Ice Queen employs a coiled-coil anchoring method; a high affinity, highly specific E/K coil system. This is a structural motif consisting of two engineered, heterodimeric alpha-helical coiled-coils. The interaction strength has been shown to be of similar strength to covalent interactions thus acting with minimal reversibility.<SUP>7</SUP> The appeal of the specificity and strength of this system presented an attractive means of anchoring our Type III AFPs to the each of the scaffold subunits.</P><H2>Icefinity</H2><P>As an addition to our project this year, we decided to further explore the topic of AFPs and their variety of applications. Protein stability is of great importance when considering the use of AFPs in industry. Typical industrial processes often involve harsh conditions which will lead to denaturation (i.e. loss of function) for the protein. Therefore, in conjunction with improving the activity of the Type III AFP, we set out to increase the stability of the protein through circularization techniques.</P><P>Using Heidelberg’s intein biobrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1362000">BBa_K1362000</A>, we performed the intein-splicing reaction with the AFP to generate a circular protein: Icefinity. Heidelberg and other research parties have shown an increase in thermostability after cyclizing any protein.<SUP>8, 9</SUP> This summer,  Circularization of the AFP has been a wonderful addition to our exploration of this fascinating protein. It also gave us the chance to make use of the open source iGEM registry and even improve upon Heidelberg’s construct. Read about our results <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Circ_AFP">here!</A></P><P>The QGEM team worked to develop Heidelberg’s intein biobrick by adding a T7 promoter to our submitted circular AFP construct. Inserting a promoter allows our biobrick to not only be a carrier, but also be an expression construct of our circular AFP.
