Your hours of laborious effort turned all for nothing? Us too and this year, we set out to avoid this very dilemma, or at least to try and minimize its effects on our project.</P><P>The modeling process was used to gain an understanding of what we expected from the wet lab work. The principle behind design was to troubleshoot and optimize the engineered components through simulations to identify mistakes within the theoretical space before using time and resources in the lab. </P><P>This preliminary design can be divided into two components: modeling a circular AFP and scaffold design. </P></DIV><DIV id="modelbodytext"><H1>MODELING A CIRCULAR AFP</H1><H2 align="center"><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Queens_Canada/Circ_AFP">Icefinity</A></H2><FIGURE style="float: left; width: 400px;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1. <STRONG>Crystal structure of the Type III Ocean Pout.</STRONG>This protein is represented by the PDB file 1AME.

Relatively active in antifreeeze activity, it serves as an ideal AFP for use in industrial purposes. Furthermore, its termini are only 19.8 angstroms apart, making it easier to circularize using a smaller linker (Figure 1).</P><P>The modeling process for the circularization of an antifreeze protein can be explained by a three-step approach to protein design (seen below). </P><H2>Linker Design &amp; Spatial Fitting</H2><P><STRONG>Approach 1:</STRONG> The idea for this project was meant to be a continuation of the work of team <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg">Heidelberg 2014</A> and validation of their parts. Using their <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1362000">intein BioBrick </A> we wanted to circularize our own protein, a Type III AFP. Using the <A href="https://github.com/igemsoftware/Heidelberg_2014">CRAUT software</A>, we ran our protein through the program. After fixing syntax errors, the following linkers were suggested:</P><LI><UL><STRONG>Sequence 1:</STRONG>GG<SPAN id="purple">AEAAAKAA</SPAN><SPAN id="red">RGKCWE</SPAN></UL><UL><STRONG>Sequence 2:</STRONG>GGXXX <SPAN id="red">RGKCWE</SPAN></UL></LI><P>The sequences in <SPAN id="red">red</SPAN> represent the extein sequences (scars that will be left after the intein reaction), and the sequences in <SPAN id="purple">purple</SPAN> represent a secondary structure (alpha-helix). Preliminary spatial evaluation using PyMOL suggested these were not ideal for linking the termini of our protein of interest. For the purpose of progression, we adapted the second sequence and opted for running simulations on our own linker designs. </P><P><STRONG>Approach 2:</STRONG>Using the extein sequence tested by Heidelberg 2014, linkers were built within PyMOL and Coot to effectively joined the N- and C- termini. Flexible linkers were chosen to enable the termini to arrange such that the protein remains in its functional conformation. </P><LI><UL><STRONG>Linker 1:</STRONG><SPAN id="red">RGKCWE</SPAN>AA</UL><UL><STRONG>Linker 2:</STRONG><SPAN id="red">RGKCWE</SPAN>GAA</UL><UL><STRONG>Linker 3:</STRONG><SPAN id="red">RGKCWE</SPAN>GGAA</UL></LI><H2>Modeling Methods &amp; Stability Analysis</H2><P>Selected linkers, from Approach 2, were then run through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using the <A href="http://www.gromacs.org/About_Gromacs"> GROMACS package </A>. Following energy minimization, the stability of the protein under physiological conditions was determined. Protein files were edited to circularize the backbone and solvated in water at 298 K to mimic those functional conditions (Figure 2).</P><DIV id="MDsims"><P style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 90px;">Figure 2:<STRONG>Circularized anti-freeze protein structure after MD simulations (left). </STRONG> These images represent the final configuration of the energy minimized and dynamic simulation tests; <STRONG>A</STRONG> showing just the protein backbone and <STRONG>B</STRONG> showing the amino acid side chains.The upper loop shows the AFP's termini linked by the extein sequence and GAA linker (Linker 2).

Baker and Yeates have successfully created a number of such scaffolds with verified crystal structures<SUP>4</SUP>.</P><P>After examination of the different constructs available, we have chosen to use the T3-10 model (Figure 5). This single subunit 12-mer has a less complicated assembly procedure as compared to a 2-unit scaffold such as T33-21. The position of the C-terminus points away from the assembled structure enabling the attachment of an engineered part. Expression and assembly requirements are easily met at room temperature from a single vector. With 12 identical subunits, the scaffold could potentially house 12 antifreeze proteins.</P><H2>Antifreeze Protein</H2><P>The Type III antifreeze protein from ocean pout, the same used in the circularization project was selected for the scaffold system as well (See Figure 1). This is a well characterized protein, whose sequence was easily accessible by QGEM this year. </P><H2>The E/K-coil system</H2><P>We sought a strong, highly efficient means to connecting AFPs to the self-assembling scaffold. After considering our options, we opted for the E/K coil method used by <A href="https://2013.igem.org/Team:Calgary">Calgary iGEM 2013</A>. These non-covalent interactions are highly specific and should enable selective binding between AFPs and the scaffold subunit.

According to the PDB file and NMR structure elicited in 2004 <SUP>5</SUP>, the coils interact in a parallel fashion, incorrectly identified as antiparallel in the registry: <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1189010">K coil</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1189011">E coil.</A> This has now been reviewed by us to indicate the correct interaction according to the PDB file 1U0I (Take a look at the experience pages for both the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1189011:Experience">E coil</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1189010:Experience">K coil</A> to read about our changes). </P><FIGURE style="float: left; width: 580px;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 6. <STRONG>Theoretical AFP-Scaffold Complex.</STRONG> Parallel coiled coil interactions selectively attach the AFP to the 12-mer scaffold. The blue ends of the coils represent the N-terminus, and the red the C-terminus.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To generate a model of our complex, the E-coil was fused to the Type III AFP and the K-coil was fused to the scaffold subunits. The expected interaction is a parallel alignment as depicted in Figure 6. The introduction of a flexible region between the C-terminus of the scaffold subunit and the coil is introduced to allow the coil movement to enable an interaction to occur without steric hindrance from the protein units. </P><H2>Coiled-Coil Stability Simulations</H2><P>Before using these coils we sought out to test their stability and method of interaction in its native form. The coils selected for our project is represented by the PDB file 1U0I, an NMR-solved crystal structure. These coils are described to interact in a parallel fashion (Figure 7a). To simulate this interaction, the individual coils were solvated and run thorugh MD simulations in GROMACS. </P><P>To simulate an antiparallel coiled-coil interaction, the K-coil's amino acid sequences were inverted such that it sat antiparallel to the E-coil. The file was then run though PyRosetta docking programs to undergo energy minimization, generating the most stable conformation. This file, with separated coil subunits, was then also run through GROMACS simulations (Figure 7b).</P><FIGURE style="width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 7. <STRONG>Pairs of coiled-coil interactions. </STRONG>E and K coils can interact in either a <STRONG>A</STRONG> parallel formation, or <STRONG>B</STRONG> an antiparallel formation.

The Lennard-Jones potential is a mathematical model that approximates the intermolecular forces between two molecules <SUP>6</SUP> and Coulomb potential describes the interaction between point charges. Statistical analysis was carried out on the energy output for each file and can be found summarized in Table 2 below.</P><TABLE><CAPTION>Table 2. <STRONG>Energy comparison of parallel and antiparallel coiled coils. </STRONG>Values are understood to be comparable energy units and a more negative energy is indicative of a more stable interaction.</CAPTION><TBODY><TR><TH>Potential</TH><TH>Mean</TH><TH>Median</TH></TR><TR><TH rowspan="2">Parallel Coils</TH><TD>Coulomb</TD><TD>-210.6366881</TD><TD>-209.408646</TD></TR><TR><TD>Lennard-Jones</TD><TD>-131.8912492</TD><TD>-132.159454</TD></TR><TR><TH rowspan="2">Antiparallel Coils</TH><TD>Coulomb</TD><TD>-200.6834072</TD><TD>-205.490387</TD></TR><TR><TD>Lennard-Jones</TD><TD>-147.8004057</TD><TD>-149.036652</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>These values suggest that when compared with the Lennard-Jones potential, the antiparallel orientation is more stable while the Coulomb potential suggests the parallel is slightly more stable. This discrepancy creates uncertainty in the theoretical knowledge of preferred orientation for these engineered coils. For the basis of this project, it is presumed that the NMR structure as determined by <A href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1u0i"> Lindhout et al. </A> is the preferred orientation and thus the coils should interact in a parallel orientation.  
</P></DIV><DIV id="Dockingstuff"><H1>PYROSETTA DOCKING &amp; LINKER TESTING</H1><H2>AFP &amp; Scaffold Docking</H2><P>In order to test the self-assembly of the AFPs and scaffold proteins with E/K coils, docking simulations were run. These were used to assess the energetic stability of the coiled coil interaction and determine the orientation of the ice-binding surface of the AFP. This was done using <A href="http://www.pyrosetta.org/">PyRosetta</A> by following the standard procedure for initial low resolution docking prior to high resolution docking on favourable protein structures. Sorting of low energy dockings was used with consideration given to the proximity of the E/K coils to choose a final selection of proteins for refinement and scoring. The general procedure used is outlined in Figure 8 and the final docked structure reached shown in Figure 9.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 8. <STRONG>Flow chart of general protocol used to determine configuration of docked AFP/scaffold complex.</STRONG> Flow chart starts with PDB files and structures of the proteins of interest, and involves isolating the most stable conformations for further analysis; <A href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=4EGG">T3-10 Scaffold</A> and <A href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1AME">Type III AFP</A>. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 9. <STRONG>Final alignment of AFP and scaffold coiled-coil interaction after docking and refinement.</STRONG>Scaffold subunits are shown in yellow with a rainbow K-coil to demonstrate directionality. An AFP is shown in grey and the ice binding residues are highlighted in orange. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2>Circularization Program</H2><P>In order to run molecular dynamic simulations of the circularized AFP, the linkers were individually fit with the scar sequence to optimize positioning to allow the terminal nitrogen and carbon groups in bond length proximity (approximately 1.3 angstroms). To save time and energy in spatially testing multiple linkers, a script was written to utilize PyRosetta’s capabilities to circularize the protein for easy visual assessment of atom positioning. This involved using the small mover method in PyRosetta to allow each movement to be checked in ‘fitting’ the linker to ensure the dihedral angles were within acceptable ranges. The script for this program can be located <A href="https://github.com/dragoschiriac/pyRosettaDocking">here.</A></P></DIV><H1>REFERENCES</H1><P>1.
