As a student-run research group, QGEM relies on funding and support from various sources. This year we would like to thank the various departments and grants at Queen's University for their generous support, as well as our external sponsors!</P></DIV><DIV id="sponsors" style="padding: 60px 200px 20px 200px;"><H2>Queen's University</H2><H3>Department of Biomedical &amp; Molecular Sciences (DBMS)</H3><P>The DBMS emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to education through the combination of multiple programs, including Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Physiology. Students have access to faculty members from a variety of backgrounds and expertise. The department has generously funded all of our lab supply needs. 
</P><H3>Faculty of Health Sciences</H3><P>The Faculty of Health Sciences encompasses three schools: the Queen’s school of Medicine, Nursing, and Rehabilitation Therapy. Students develop the skills and competencies necessary to provide quality health care through education, research, clinical pursuits, and problem-solving. </P><H3>Department of Chemical Engineering</H3><P>The Department of Chemical Engineering supports research from many fields, including projects with applications to biochemical and biomedical engineering. The department encourages multi-disciplinary projects that require collaboration among researchers from a variety of subject areas, including biology, chemistry, and mechanical engineering. </P><H3>Dean's Donation (Engineering)</H3><P>The Dean’s Donation is given out twice during the school year to support student-led initiatives. The fund finances competitive design teams, outreach programs, conferences, clubs, and student businesses on campus that bring distinction to the university. It aims to support and encourage values and skills such as teamwork, leadership, planning, design, marketing, and communication. </P><H3>Student Initiatives Fund</H3><P>The Student Initiatives Fund was established by the Vice-Provost and Dean of Student Affairs to enhance the quality of student life. It provides monetary support to student groups and registered students aiming to engage the community through organized activities, programs, or events. </P><H2>Qubit</H2><P>Qubit Systems Inc. manufactures instrumentation for the biological sciences. They cater to research projects and teaching applications from a broad range of biological disciplines, providing instrumentation to study algae and bacteria, plants, animals, insects, aquatic species, and human physiology. Systems are available for the study of photosynthesis, gas exchange, transpiration, and even atmospheric conditions. Qubit was the first company to offer a chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system used in plant phenotyping. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
