Many thanks to the following individuals who helped us turn our project idea into reality
Project Advisors
Dr. John Allingham: Professor of Biochemistry, Queen's University. Our principle investigator and advisor for QGEM 2015. Supported our team every step of the way by offering lab space, equipment, reagents, training, and expertise on everything from cloning strategies to protein purification. Also guided us in our online biochemistry curriculum development, and introduced QGEM to the world of twitter.
Dr. Peter Davies: Professor of Biochemistry, Queen's University. Our resident antifreeze protein expert, Dr. Davies provided our team with invaluable knowledge and connections to external researchers as we began to explore the possibilities of antifreeze proteins, as well as protein scaffolds. Dr. Davies also provided QGEM with substantial guidance in design, lab space, reagents, and all of our antifreeze protein plasmids.
Dry Lab
Dr. Robert Campbell: Assistant Professor, Queen's University. Provided assistance and guidance to the modeling group, offering his expertise and experience in understanding and utilizing molecular simulations to test our designs.
Wet Lab
Dr. Corey Frazer: Senior Research Associate/Lab Manager in the Allingham lab. Trained our team members in molecular biology techniques, and provided day-to-day assistance in the lab for our AFP circularization, as well as our AFP scaffold projects.
Sherry Gauthier: Research Assistant in the Davies lab.Offered her expertise and assistance in cloning, transforming, and purifying antifreeze protein genes, gained from many years of experience in the field. Also helped train members of the team to work in the wet lab.
Dr. Laurie Graham: Offered her many years' experience in biochemistry knowledge, always willing to double check our work and help troubleshoot when necessary.
Sean Phippen: Graduate Student in the Davies lab. Assisted with cloning our AFP/E coil construct, and offering tips for working with the protein scaffold.
Corey Stevens: Graduate Student in the Davies lab. Provided us with advice in the planning stage of our project, specifically how to approach design of a system with multiple linked AFPs.
Koli Basu: Graduate Student in the Davies lab. Assisted with ice-affinity purification of our circularized AFP using Team Heidelberg 2014's intein construct.
Tyler Vance: Graduate Student in the Davies lab. Assisted with teaching the team lab techniques for AFP cloning and AFP purification.
Jacqueline Hellinga: Graduate student in the Allingham lab. Taught our wet lab team new techniques and ideas for cloning, and stepped in to help troubleshoot when we encountered unexpected results.
Neil King/Baker Lab: Generously provided plasmids with the T3-10 sequence for the AFP-scaffold project.
THANK YOU ALL!
