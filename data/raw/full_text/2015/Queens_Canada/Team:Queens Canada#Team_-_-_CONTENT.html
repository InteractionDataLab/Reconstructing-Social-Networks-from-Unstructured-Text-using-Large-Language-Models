Our members this year have all come from such diverse backgrounds and have each contributed to QGEM 2015 in their                 own unique way. </P><P align="center"><STRONG>Scroll down to learn more about the members of QGEM 2015!</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV id="biocontainer" style="padding: 50px;"><DIV id="biobox4"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Joanna Semrau</STRONG></H2><P>Joanna is in her fourth year studying Life Sciences and Psychology. She has been involved with QGEM for a number of years now, and has truly found it an exciting learning experience! Joanna plans to pursue research that could possibly combine her interests in psychology and molecular biology. In developing her skills in human resources and web design, she thinks the next step for her may be managing a circus and learning to tame giraffes. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox2"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Justine Ring</STRONG></H2><P>Justine is in her final year of Life Sciences. After volunteering with the team last summer she decided to come back to play a more prominent role in the project. Justine is hopeful that her bike issues will be resolved and she may one day have a functional means of transportation to and from work. When not planning her escape back to the East Coast, she finds time to enjoy the small joys of life, such as writing essays and working later than everyone else.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox3"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Morgan Litschko</STRONG></H2><P>Morgan is in her third year studying Engineering Chemistry. She saw QGEM as an opportunity to merge her interests in engineering and biochemistry, while also finding an excuse to look at cute ocean pout images. Morgan hopes to graduate engineering successfully without switching faculties any more times! She spends most of her time trying to convince the team to incorporate more yellow into team presentations.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox1"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Malak Elbatarny</STRONG></H2><P>Malak will be starting first year medicine in the fall. With a passion for innovative research, she joined QGEM to become part of a team that works towards solving a problem. QGEM also fuelled Malak’s competitive spirit! Playing a prominent role in external affairs and finances on the team, Malak is often found on the phone or responding to questions with “okay first, let me make some calls.”! </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox5"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Kersh Theva</STRONG></H2><P>Kersh has just finished his degree in the Life Sciences. Upon discovering QGEM and its members, he was struck by their free-roaming spirits, scientific competence and thirst for knowledge. Kersh became enchanted by the possibilities that this field presented. He continues to follow the stream of bioengineering innovation, wherever it takes him. In addition, Kersh has also worked as a sheep farmer in southeast Ontario.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox6"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Amanda Fantin</STRONG></H2><P>Amanda is in her third year studying Biology and Life Sciences. She saw QGEM as an amazing opportunity to pursue her interest and develop skills in synthetic biology and biotechnology. Amanda hopes to study medicine as well as further enhance the standards of care and quality of life through research. Amanda also has two cats, Mozart and Shakespeare, who are described by her as the loves of her life. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox7"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Candice Tang</STRONG></H2><P> Candice is in her fourth year studying Life Sciences and Psychology. She joined QGEM this summer to develop laboratory skills; learn more about synthetic biology; and to connect with students, faculty, and members of the Kingston community.  She hopes to pursue graduate studies in Pathophysiology or Neuroscience. In her spare time, you may find Candice watching hilarious cat videos or making balloon animals.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox8"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Dragos Chiriac</STRONG></H2><P>Dragos is in his third year of Life Science. With this year's QGEM team being primarily female, he figured it would be the perfect environment to overcome his issues talking to the opposite gender. He has been forced to discover his passion for computer science and has learned about the requirements of being volun-told, I mean, volunteering. In his free time, he can be found resolving the world's issues using PyRosetta while claiming to be studying for the MCAT.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox9"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Julia Grein</STRONG></H2><P> Julia is in her second year, studying Biochemistry with a certificate in Business. She first found out about QGEM in her first year and knew that this was an invaluable opportunity to dive into the world of synthetic biology. As for the future, Julia plans to keep her options open after her undergraduate studies while also maintaining a strong interest in research and lab work. Julia is affectionately known as the munchkin of QGEM 2015.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox10"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Danielle Ciren</STRONG></H2><P>Danielle is in her second year studying Biology. She was excited by the prospect of participating in QGEM because of the opportunities to learn new skills and apply her classroom knowledge to real life research! In the future, Danielle would like to pursue graduate studies in biology or health care. She is known for love of Tim Horton's Iced Capps.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="biobox11"><DIV class="text"><H2><STRONG>Jia Tanwani</STRONG></H2><P>Jia is in her third year of Life Science. Viewing innovation as the basis for all advancements, she was fascinated by the scientific innovation within QGEM and eager to be part of a team working to solve real-world problems. Her future aspirations include writing a book (topic to be decided), and climbing Mount Everest! A fun fact about Jia is that her birthday is on Halloween :) </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="profs"><H1>Professor Advisors:</H1><A href="https://dbms.queensu.ca/faculty/john_allingham"><H2 style="font-size: 28px;">Dr. John Allingham </H2></A><A href="http://pldserver1.biochem.queensu.ca/people.shtml"><H2 style="font-size: 28px;">Dr. Peter Davies </H2></A><A href="https://dbms.queensu.ca/faculty/robert_campbell"><H2 style="font-size: 28px;">Dr. Robert Campbell</H2></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
