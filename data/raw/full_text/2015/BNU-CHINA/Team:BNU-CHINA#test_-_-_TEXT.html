Disadvantages
Fumigant
halohydrocarbon
Halohydrocarbon nemafene
Kill the nematodes in the soil and other small pests
High toxicity Do harm to the soil, the environment even the health. The using period is limited. It is probably do harm to the crops. Preventive nematicides. The operation is very complex.
