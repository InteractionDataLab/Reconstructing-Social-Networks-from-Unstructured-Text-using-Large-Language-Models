Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
Under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Xudong, Prof. Yang Dong, and Prof. Xiang Benqiong etc, nearly all team members have taken part in the project designing process, especially those of wet lab group. Beichen Gao , Yuanyi Dai , Yufei Cao and Jia Li are the group leaders who mainly designed the experimental patterns and guided different parts of the project.
Modeling
Cheng Li is the leader of modeling group, who mainly enrolled in designing the device 2.0. Yuan Yin , Qiuyue Yuan and Xueting Zhao also do a great many works in the modeling group, such as information searching, paper writing and equipment appilication.
Wiki Construction
Jiajun Zhang , who has led the web design group to build the wiki, together with group members Zhiyao Chen and Chengfei Peng complete the main work in database construction and maintenance.
Graphic design
Lu Xu( group leader), Lee and Yalei Cao really do a fantastic work in graphic and web design. They all make great efforts in designing our team logo, website, poster, souvenir, T-shirt and so on.
Human practice
Meng Tang , the leader of human practice group, has organized a series of activities for Policy and Practice, like survey and publicize in some middle schools etc. Some group members as Yuanyi Dai, Jia Li , Jiajun Zhang , Beichen Gao , Zhiyao Chen , Jingyu Zhao , Xiaofei Feng also play a significant role in planning and organizing the activities . Other group members also take an active part in some other activities of human practice.
