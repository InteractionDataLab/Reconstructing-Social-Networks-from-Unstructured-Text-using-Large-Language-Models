Lao Kejing
A sophomore majoring in biology. Her work includes  plasmid purification, SDS-PAGE and nematodes synchronization. She also tried to help BIT-China with extracting membrane proteins, NhaA and NhaB.
Liu Longping
A sophomore student who has worked on how to promote the expression rate of rMpL as well as designed the toxic test on nematodes.
Chen Zhiyao
The only freshman in our team, majoring in physics. Developed the toxic and attractant database with Peng Chengfei. Also designed the UI of the database website, and took part in HP activities too!
Wang Yingbing
A junior biotech student of BNU. Mainly did some paper work for the team, and also took part in the “bace16” group work.
Siren
In Greek mythology, the Sirens were dangerous yet beautiful creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and eat them. We call our machine Sirens as it can attract nematodes and kill them just like the Sirens do to their meals.
Cao Yufei
A junior student in Liyun College of BNU, biology major. She is responsible for the parts design for expressing limonene in E. coli and coresponding experiments.
Li Jia
A junior bioscience student, wants to learn more about synthetic biology and makes more friends in iGEM.  Mainly worked on testifying the chemical attractants. Besides she expressed limonene and GPP synthase, and cultivated C.elegans.
Yin Yuan
A sophomore majoring in mathematics. Helped set up the model in proposingthe solving ideas and searching the data.
Zhao Xueting
A sophomore in mathematics. Did work of modeling section like finding out how to put equipment on farmland, writing modeling paper, doing some translation and so on.
Liu Xinyu
A sophomore biology student. Is a member of the limonene group of this project, and also took part in human practice and other parts' experiments.
Li Yuehuan
A sophomore bioscience student. She helped design and verify parts of the module.
Wu Zekai
A sophomore biology student. Designed a part of biobrick of photoinduction system, and took part in some experiments of verifing the toxicity of Bace 16.
Yuan Qiuyue
A junior majoring in mathematics. Simulated the movement of nematodes, and established the model of diffusion of the attraction.

A junior bioscience student who is the leader of graphic design group. Did the design work for BNU-CHINA, particularly on poster and PPT design. In addition, she made a batch of uniform shirts for our team.
Gao Beichen
The leader of our team, a junior biotech student of Beijing Normal University. Mainly worked for the wet lab part including constructing parts, expressing nematocidal proteins and testifying the toxicity of rMpL.
Tang Meng
A junior Bioscience BNU student. The HP project leader who organized most activities for Policy and Practice, such as surveys, publicity and voluntary education. She also took part in nematodes cultivating.
Dai Yuanyi
A junior BNU student majoring in Biotech. Devoted all her energy and time in iGEM, making her a multitasking girl. Her work involves of many aspects, mainly the construction of biobricks and expriments on Bace16.
Li Cheng
A junior bioscience student.  The leader of modeling part, designed the device 2.0. Also proposes many useful ideas in this team, such as the online database and the design to improve parts. Also enrolled in Wiki and Art work.
Zhao Jingyu
A sophomore majoring in biology. Took part in experiments such as the expression of the toxin rMpL, and also did some work in human practice.
Peng Chengfei
A sophomore student of Computer Science. Is responsible for the some technical work like constructing the database and the corresponding website and the deployment and operation of the database.
Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
Under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Xudong, Prof. Yang Dong, and Prof. Xiang Benqiong etc, nearly all team members have taken part in the project designing process, especially those of wet lab group.Beichen Gao , Yuanyi Dai , Yufei Cao and Jia Li are the group leaders who mainly design the experimental patterns and guide the different parts of the experiments.
Modeling
Cheng Li is the leader of modeling group, who mainly enrolled in designing the device 2.0. Yuan Yin , Qiuyue Yuan and Xueting Zhao also do a great many works in the modeling group, such as information searching, paper writing and equipment appilication.
Wiki Construction
Jiajun Zhang , who has led the web design group to build the wiki, together with group members Zhiyao Chen and Chengfei Peng complete the main work in database construction and maintenance.
Graphic design
Lu Xu( group leader), Lee and Yalei Cao really do a fantastic work in graphic and web design. They all make great efforts in designing our team logo, website, poster, souvenir, T-shirt and so on.
Human practice
Meng Tang , the leader of human practice group, has organized a series of activities for Policy and Practice, like survey and publicize in some middle schools etc. Some group members as Yuanyi Dai, Jia Li , Jiajun Zhang , Beichen Gao , Zhiyao Chen , Jingyu Zhao , Xiaofei Feng also play a significant role in planning and organizing the activities . Other group members also take an active part in some other activities of human practice.
