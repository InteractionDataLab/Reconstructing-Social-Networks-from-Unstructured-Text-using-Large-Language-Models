Synthetic Intelligent Ranger E. coli for Nematodes.
BACKGROUND
Plant - parasitic nematodes which are usually too tiny to catch sight of have caused serious losses to agricultural crops worldwide. Over 5000 species of 200 genus can parasitize various organs of manifold plants widely. According to incomplete statistics, the losses caused by pathogenic nematodes can reach $100 billion every year worldwide.
BAIT & KILLER
In our project, we designed three modules to attract and poison plant-parasitic nematodes. The E.coli would express attractant to allure nematodes when exposed to light, and  express toxin to kill them as a result of the promoter’s reverse in the dark.
DEVICE
We designed a device with engineering bacteria inside, which can be placed in soil to attract and kill nematodes. We took advantage of gas diffusion and nematodes’ movement analogue simulation to find the best position for the device to be placed in an assuming farmland. And a database is built to broaden the scope of our applications.
POLICY & PRACTICE
According to our survey, the farmer had not realize the damage of nematodes and we gave some suggestions to them. We interviewed related experts, dropped in the countryside, analyzed the soil sample, communicated with other teams and did assistance.
