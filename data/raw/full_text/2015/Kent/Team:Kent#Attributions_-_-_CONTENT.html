Our entire team together with the instructors and advisors decided on the project that we are carrying out at the beginning of the summer. The team met up once every week to share project ideas and discuss the direction of the project during the summer. The project that we have designed is to create nanowire from amyloid produced by <I>E.coli</I> creating a more biocompatible and cheaper alternative to current materials used as nanowire. We were inspired by the pioneering work carried out by Ann Hochschild and Viknesh Sivanathan <SUP><A href="#r1">[1]</A></SUP> which provided us with information on how to utilise the curli export system of <I>E.coli</I> strain VS45 to form our nanowires. Also the work of Frederick et al. 2014<SUP><A href="#r2">[2]</A></SUP> and Glover et al. 1997<SUP><A href="#r3">[3]</A></SUP> which helped us understand the formation of amyloid and the self-assembling ability of Sup35-NM. The amyloid fusion protein that we have produced has been made using Sup35-NM fused to a cytochrome. More on the description of our project can be found <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Kent/Description">here</A>.
</P></UL><H2> Modelling and software </H2><UL><P align="justify">
We wanted to develop tools to predict the growth and production of amyloid nanowires, and to find a way to visually represent the amyloid production of the <I> E.coli</I> bacteria in 3D. This was accomplished by the modeling team consisting of James, Moyra and Raneem. The team developed a new software implementing Brownian dynamics<SUP><A href="#r4">[4]</A></SUP> and the Monte Carlo method<SUP><A href="#r5">[5]</A></SUP> written in Matlab. Our model and software is available to view <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Kent/Modeling"> here</A>.
</P></UL><H2> Policy and Practice</H2><UL><P align="justify">
The main Policy and Practice issues identified by the team is centered on policy and public opinion on the use of bio-nano material. Finding out what the general public and members of parliament thought of our idea was therefore carried out in order to develop a wider understanding of how our product would be received in the real world. A Policy and Practice team consisting of Moyra, Raneem, Alice and Anna was formed to allow us to communicate with other iGEM teams as well as the general public and political figures to gather their opinions and tell them more about our project. More information on our Policy and Practice can be found<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Kent/Practices"> here</A>.
</P></UL><H2> Wet lab </H2><UL><P align="justify">
The wet lab work was naturally given to the bioscientists within the team, including Katarina, Richard, Alice, Natalie, Suparna, Jonathan, Anna and Rob who have carried out a vast range of experiments including but not exclusively AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) imaging, Gibson Assembly, Ligation and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). This was vital to the success of our project and was our main focus throughout the competition. More of our protocols, experiments and results can be found<A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Kent/Experiments"> here</A>.
</P></UL><H2> Writing </H2><UL><P align="justify">
Throughout the course of iGEM the whole team have been carrying out research and reading papers related to our project to allow us all to contribute to writing up our final project. We have weekly meetings where we talk to one another about what has been done during the week which we record in our notebook which you can find <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Kent/Notebook">here</A>. We have designed and written posters, presentations and in depth explanations into our project that the whole team have helped produce. The wiki was organised and coded by our wiki team consisting of James, Natalie and Raneem.
