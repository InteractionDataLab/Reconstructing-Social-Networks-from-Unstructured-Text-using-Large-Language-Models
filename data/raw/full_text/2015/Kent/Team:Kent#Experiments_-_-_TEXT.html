Competent Cells
Overview
Competent cells are ready to use bacterial cells that possess altered cell walls by which foreign DNA can be passed through easily. E. coli cells that have been specially treated to transform efficiently.
Materials
3ml 1M MnCl2
15ml 1M CaCl2
60ml 50mM MES
45ml glycerol
177ml ddH2O
Procedure
Back-dilute overnight culture of VS45 cells to OD600 0.1 in 250 ml LB broth
Grow cells at 37˚C to OD600 0.6 and then harvest by centrifugation.
Resuspend the cells in 100 ml of prechilled buffer and incubate on ice for 60 minutes.
Harvest again by centrifugation (at 4˚C), and resuspend in 5 ml of pre-chilled buffer.
The resuspended cells can then be aliquoted (on ice), frozen using dry ice or liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80˚C.
Transformation Protocol
Overview
Transformation is the process by which a foreign DNA is introduced into a cell.
Materials
Resuspended DNA
Competent cells
2ml tube
42˚C water bath
Petri dishes with LB agar and appropriate antibiotic
37˚C incubator
10pg/ul RFP Control
Procedure
Thaw the competent cells on ice
Add 50 µL of thawed competent cells into pre-chilled 2ml tube, and another 50µL into a 2ml tube, labelled for your control.
Add 1 - 2 µL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube. Pipet up and down a few times, gently.(Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice. )
Add 1 µL of the RFP Control to your control transformation.
Close tubes and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ºC for 60 seconds.
Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 200 μl of SOC media (making sure that the broth does not contain antibiotics and is not contaminated) to each transformation
Incubate the cells at 37˚C for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking.2 hour recovery time helps in transformation efficiency, especially for plasmid backbones with antibiotic resistance other than ampicillin.
Label two petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 20 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
For the control, label two petri dishes with LB agar (AMP). Plate 20 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
Incubate the plates at 37ºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. (Incubating for too long starts to break down the antibiotics and un-transformed cells will begin to grow.)
Pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture and miniprep.
Count the colonies on the 20 μl control plate.
