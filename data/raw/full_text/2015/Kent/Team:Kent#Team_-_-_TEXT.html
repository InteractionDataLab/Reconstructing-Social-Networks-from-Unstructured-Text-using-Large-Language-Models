Team
Moyra Chikomo
I’m an Electronics and Communications Engineering student.
I chose to be a part of the Kent iGEM team this year as I wanted to be a part of a research team that was a little out of my field of study. I felt this would be a great chance to use my biology background from school and see if I could integrate that with my passion for engineering.
After I have graduated I am looking into doing further research and work towards a PhD. In the little “free” time I have I enjoy channeling my creative side, this involves general arts and crafts as well as writing short stories (for my eyes only for now ☺☺). I would say watching back to back series takes up a lot of my time and keeps me sane.
Raneem Jaghoub
I am an Electronics and Communications Engineering student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGEM for the experience and to help me decide whether I would like to continue to do a Masters degree in Genetic Engineering. In my free time I enjoy reading, painting and travelling.
Jonathan Pope
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to do iGem because it gives students experience in working in teams with synthetic biology outside of the usual confinements of a syllabus.
In the future i plan to further my study and complete a PhD and gain more experience in the field of Biology. I play for a local mens football team and listen to hours of music in my free time as well as being an avid Arsenal fan.
Rob Middlewick
I am a Biology student at The University of Kent. I chose to join the iGEM team due to my fascination with synthetic biology and because I believe that it is an emerging market. It has provided me with valuable experience working in a research environment that will prepare me to undertake a PhD after I’ve completed my degree. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, reading, and cooking.
Richard Crane (aka Dave)
I am a Biomedical Sciences student from Ipswich, England studying at The University of Kent. I followed the progress of the 2014 Kent iGEM team and after seeing synthetic biology become more prevalent in the news, I was inspired to join this year.
After I graduate, I would like to pursue a PhD and stay in academia. They say about me: "Richard  likes to hurt peoples feelings and doesn't care about the wiki".
James Aston
I am the team's physicist, I spent my time at iGEM working on the modeling and the wiki. I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to be a part of a multidisciplinary team. In my spare time I like to play guitar and watch Always Sunny reruns.

Katarina Pisani
I am a Biomedical Sciences student from Trieste, Italy studying at The University of Kent. My reason for joining iGEM was because I wanted a better understanding and experience of what it means to be a researcher, I wanted to gain further knowledge and practical skills, that would enable me to reach my full potential when pursuing my scientific career.
After I graduate I would like to continue with some further studies and specialize as a researcher. I also want to dedicate time for traveling. In my free time I like to play the piano and I also enjoy running and fencing.
Anna Beltrami
I am a Biomedical Sciences student from Trento, Italy studying at The University of Kent.  I decided to join the iGEM team because I was fascinated with the multidisciplinary focus of the competition, the ethos of innovation and the aspect of creativity in the laboratory. After graduation, I am planning to do a PhD and afterwards undertake a career as a patent attorney. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, reading and blogging. I am also in the committee of various societies at The University of  Kent. Fun Fact: I rage when people spell "defiantly" instead of "definitely".

Suparna Thakali
I am an undergraduate student from Mustang, Nepal studying Biochemistry at Kent. I am very keen on this field of synthetic biology, hence I have thoroughly enjoyed participating in this project. One of my main highlights was being able to present and communicate with the general public to raise awareness about our project during the public workshop outreach event.
My future aspiration, being heavily influenced by iGEM, is to further my science career into research and even higher education so that I can make a difference in the lives of people in areas of need. Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming, watching sci-fi movies and reading.
Natalie Sloan
I am a Biomedical Science student at The University of Kent. I decided to do iGEM to gain lab experience and to help me decide whether I want to do a masters or PhD. Upon graduation, I hope to further my education and do a PhD. In my free time I enjoy gaming and playing tennis.
"Kaboooooom" -Alice Tomlinson
I am a Biomedical Sciences student from Toulouse, France studying at The University of Kent. I aspire to pursue a career in research, hence why I decided to join the iGEM team at my university. This decision has further intensified my passion for innovation and research. I would like to live life knowing I am making a difference in the world. In my free time I like to read books, bake and trek.
Ben Blakeman
Ben is a PhD student in the School of Biosciences. When he is not at the gym, he enjoys teaching and entertaining students with his bubbly personality.
Morena
Morena is a PhD student in the School of Biosciences, she regularly helped the wet lab team.
Dr Wei-Feng Xue
Dr Wei-Feng Xue joined the school of Biosciences in 2011 as Lecturer in Chemical biology, and he is now Senior Lecturer in Chemical biology since 2014. He received his PhD degree in Physical Chemistry on research regarding protein-protein/protein-ligand interactions in Prof. Sara Linse’s group at Lund University in Sweden (2006). He then went on to do postdoctoral research concerning the mechanism and the biological impact of amyloid assembly in Prof. Sheena Radford’s laboratory at the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology in the University of Leeds (2006-2011). His research interests include supramolecular protein assembly, protein folding and misfolding, amyloid and prions, and AFM imaging.
Wei-Feng is a member of the Kent Fungal Group , the Protein Form and Function Group  and the Centre for Molecular Processing
Dr Mark Shepherd
Dr Mark Shepherd joined the School of Biosciences in 2011. He was born in England, was brought up in North Wales, and subsequently studied Biochemistry at the University of Sheffield (1996-1999). He stayed in the Department of Molecular Biology & Biotechnology to undertake a PhD with Professor Neil Hunter FRS (1999-2003), where he developed his interest in the enzymology and spectroscopy of chlorophyll and haem biosynthesis. After completing his PhD studies, he conducted postdoctoral research with Prof. Harry Dailey at the University of Georgia (2003-2005), where his research focussed on the terminal enzymes of haem biosynthesis. This was followed by a move back to the University of Sheffield in 2005 to take up a postdoctoral position with Prof. Robert Poole, where he developed interests in E. coli respiration, globin proteins, and the response of bacteria to nitric oxide. A subsequent position at the University of Queensland (2010-2011) with Prof. Mark Schembri focussed on nitric oxide stress in Uropathogenic E. coli.
In 2011 Mark moved to the University of Kent, where he is a Lecturer in Microbial Biochemistry and a member of the Microbial Pathogenesis Group .
Dr Gianluca Marcelli
Dr Gianluca Marcelli is a lecturer in the School of Engineering and Digital Arts. In the last 9 years of his research career he has been developing mathematical models for biological systems. He helped the modeling team and it was his idea to create a Monte Carlo simulation.
Dr Mark Wass
Mark joined the School of Biosciences in October 2012. He obtained his first degree in Natural Sciences at Cambridge University in 2000 followed by a Masters in Computing at Imperial College London. After a few years working in Industry as an IT consultant Mark studied for a PhD with Prof Mike Sternberg at Imperial (2004-2008) and continued onto a post-doctoral position in the group until 2011. In 2011 Mark was awarded a FEBS Long Term Fellowship to work in the group of Alfonso Valencia at the CNIO (Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain).
Mark's research interests are in Structural Bioinformatics particularly the analysis and prediction of protein function, structure and interactions. He is also interested in using such approaches to analyse genetic variation and identify the functional effects that are associated with disease.
Mark is a member of the Cytogenomics and Bioinformatics Group .
