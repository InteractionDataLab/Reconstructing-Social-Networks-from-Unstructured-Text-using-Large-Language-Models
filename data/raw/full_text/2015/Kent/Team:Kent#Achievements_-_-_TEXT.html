Achievements
Over the short few months of our iGem project, we managed to achieve a great deal both in and out of the lab. In the lab we created our own BioBricks, formed a new part collection and were also able to optimise previous teams BioBricks.  Outside the lab we were successful in contacting politicians at home and abroad, created software to model our system and collaborated with other teams.  Below is a colour coded guide of what we have achieved based on the iGem medal criteria
Created a BioBrick encoding the electron carrier protein cytochrome b562. Validated using a diagnostic digest.
Produced a BioBrick containing the sequences for Sup35NM linked to the csgA signal sequence designed to target the Sec and curli protein export pathways. Once in the extracellular space Sup35NM will self-assemble into amyloid fibres.
The part has been validated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Congo red plate assay. This can be used by teams in the future to attach a functional protein domain onto Sup35-NM and form functional amyloid.
Our Envirowire BioBrick has been produced with the csgA signal sequence, Sup35NM, and cytochrome b562, forming a fusion protein. We have validated that our fusion protein is exported and forms amyloid nano-wire using AFM and Congo red plate assay. Conductivity tests have also been carried out.
We participated in an open event at our university, where we explained the concept of our project with alumni and members of the public in order to increase awareness of synthetic biology and its potential use to solve various problems.
We created a model which simulates Brownian motion for a self-assembling biological structure.
We created interactive software which demonstrates the model of the system.
Valencia 2010 iGEM team produced a BioBrick encoding the Sup35NM protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Part:BBa_K401001). We submitted an improved Sup35NM BioBrick with an optimised sequence producing a part with improved compatiblity with the iGEM submission standards.
We have created a new amyloid parts collection for the iGEM repository. It currently includes three amyloid forming parts including, Envirowire, a csgA Sup35-NM containing part, and the improved Sup35NM BioBrick from Valencia 2010
We have collaborated with UNITN-Trento team to help them with the modelling and provided presentation feedback because as the only Italian iGem team they were unable to meet up with other iGEM teams during the summer. We went to two UK meet-ups hosted by Birkbeck, and Westminster.
We carried out innovative policy and practices approaches by contacting politicians in England and Italy to ask their opinion on synthetic biology and our project, and whether they thought it would be feasible in their respective areas.
