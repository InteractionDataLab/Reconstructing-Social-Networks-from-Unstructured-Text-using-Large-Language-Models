Overview
During the course of project we had the opportunity to attend two iGEm meetups in London. On July 31st, Birkbeck hosted the first London iGEM Meetup, in collaboration with UCL, London Biohackers and University of Westminster. All teams got a chance to present their project - it was a great afternoon and very useful practice for the Giant Jamboree.  More recently, University of Westminster hosted the second meetup, which was a two day event 4-5 September, where a lot more teams from around the country could present their work and bounce back ideas that woukd aid the final presentations. We found these meetups to be of great importance not only because they acted as "dress rehearsals", but also it was a chance to get people to complete our questionnaires and give us vital feedback that improved aspects of our project. With this, we would like to thank Birkbeck and Westminster for the invites and the opportunity.
