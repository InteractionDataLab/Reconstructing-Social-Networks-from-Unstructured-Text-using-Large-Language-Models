On our first day in the lab, we began by autoclaving equipment ready for use throughout our project. Specifically, we made LB plates, LB broth and autoclaved pipette tips
Day 2 23/06/15
We set up overnight cultures of Top10, VS45 and MS348 cells. We then met with our supervisors to discuss our progress.
Day 3 24/06/15
First, we made and filter sterilised MES buffer. Then we added our Top10 cells to 250ml of LB broth containing no antibiotics. The culture was then incubated until the OD600 was 0.6. Finally, we miniprepped pSB1C3 out of MS348.
Day 4 25/06/15
We set up an overnight digest of pSB1C3 ready to be run on an agarose gel in order to check that we had obtained the correct plasmid from the cells. We then transformed pSB1C3 into our competent Top10 cells. Next, we plated the transformations out onto Chloramphenicol plates and incubated them at 37ºC overnight.
Day 5 26/06/15 - The First of Many Gels
We checked the plates that had been inoculated overnight and calculated the competent cell efficiency. We then ran an agarose gel of the overnight digest. We decided on the layout for the wiki.
Day 6 29/06/15
On this day, we transformed linear pSB1C3 into our Top10 cells. We also set up overnight liquid cultures of MS349 cells containing pSB1A3. We set up a large quantity digest of pSB1C3, ready for gel extraction the following day.
Day 7 30/06/15
We miniprepped pSB1A3 and set up an overnight digest of it. We then ran the overnight digest of a large quantity of pSB1C3 on a gel. Finally, we had a meeting with our supervisors to discuss our progress.
Day 8 01/07/15
We ran a gel of purified pSB1C3 ready to be extracted, we then set up a digest of our entire stock of pSB1C3. We also transformed pSB1A3 into competent VS45 cells and plated it onto mixed Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin plates. We set up overnight cultures of MS340 containing pSB1C3.
Day 9 02/07/15
On this day we miniprepped pSB1C3 out of MS340. We then ran an agarose gel of the "big digest" and carried out a gel extraction procedure. We then quantified the digested material.

We transformed Top10 cells with pVS105 (negative control plasmid) and streaked it onto Ampicillin LB plates. We also transformed VS45 with pVS72 and plated it onto Chloramphenicol/Ampicillin LB plates.
Day 27 28/07/15
We made new Chloramphenicol broth and Ampicillin broth. We then used the Amp broth to resuspend Top10 cells with pVS105. We then resuspended VS45 with pVS72 in combined Chloramphenicol and Ampicillin broth. We incubated these cultures overnight at 37ºC. For the remainder of the day, we focused on dry lab tasks.
Day 28 29/07/15
In the morning, we miniprepped the Top 10 cells containing pVS105. This will be our negative control plasmid. Following this, we diluted our culture of VS45 with pVS72 to an OD600 of 0.1 in 3ml of LB. Once the correct OD600 had been achieved, we spot plated 5μl of the culture onto inducing plates (containing Arabinose and IPTG), non-inducing plates and Congo red plates (both inducing and non-inducing).
