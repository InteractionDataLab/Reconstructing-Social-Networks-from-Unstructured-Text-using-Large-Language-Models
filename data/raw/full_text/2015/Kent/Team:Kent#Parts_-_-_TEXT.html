Part Documentation
This year we have made 4 BioBricks, as documented in the table below. Our BioBricks comprise of both a trio of functional amyloid-forming parts and Cytochrome b562. We hope that in the future, other teams will be able to expand upon our collection as more novel uses for functional amyloid are envisaged.
