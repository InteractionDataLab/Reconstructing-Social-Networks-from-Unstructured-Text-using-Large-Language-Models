I’m an Electronics and Communications Engineering student.
I chose to be a part of the Kent iGEM team this year as I wanted to be a part of a research team that was a little out of my field of study. I felt this would be a great chance to use my biology background from school and see if I could integrate that with my passion for engineering.
After I have graduated I am looking into doing further research and work towards a PhD. In the little “free” time I have I enjoy channeling my creative side, this involves general arts and crafts as well as writing short stories <I>(for my eyes only for now ☺☺)</I>. I would say watching back to back series takes up a lot of my time and keeps me sane.

I chose to do iGem because it gives students experience in working in teams with synthetic biology outside of the usual confinements of a syllabus. In the future i plan to further my study and complete a PhD and gain more experience in the field of Biology. I play for a local mens football team and listen to hours of music in my free time as well as being an avid Arsenal fan.

My reason for joining iGEM was because I wanted a better understanding and experience of what it means to be a researcher, I wanted to gain further knowledge and practical skills, that would enable me to reach my full potential when pursuing my scientific career.
After I graduate I would like to continue with some further studies and specialize as a researcher. I also want to dedicate time for traveling. In my free time I like to play the piano and I also enjoy running and fencing.

I decided to join the iGEM team because I was fascinated with the multidisciplinary focus of the competition, the ethos of innovation and the aspect of creativity in the laboratory. After graduation, I am planning to do a PhD and afterwards undertake a career as a patent attorney. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, reading and blogging. I am also in the committee of various societies at The University of  Kent. Fun Fact: I rage when people spell &quot;defiantly&quot; instead of &quot;definitely&quot;.   <A href="https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/anna-chiara-beltrami/a9/134/8b0"> LinkedIn</A></DIV></DIV><DIV id="suparnaprofile" style="color:black;padding-right:10px;display:none;"><DIV style="margin-left:310px;"><B> Suparna Thakali </B> I am an undergraduate student from Mustang, Nepal studying Biochemistry at Kent. I am very keen on this field of synthetic biology, hence I have thoroughly enjoyed participating in this project. One of my main highlights was being able to present and communicate with the general public to raise awareness about our project during the public workshop outreach event.
My future aspiration, being heavily influenced by iGEM, is to further my science career into research and even higher education so that I can make a difference in the lives of people in areas of need.
Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming, watching sci-fi movies and reading.
