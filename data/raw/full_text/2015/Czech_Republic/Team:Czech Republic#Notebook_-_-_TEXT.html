Module 3
Transformation of the EBY100 yeast cells with the streptavidin yeast display plasmid ( Transformation ).
Growing and induction of the yeast transformants in 20 °C and 30 °C. Induction in 20 °C was used because streptavidin monomers tend to fold incorrectly in higher temperatures.
Microfluidics experiments examined functionality of the displayed streptavidin. Microfluidics chips covered with biotinylated gelatin were used in our case.
Summary: Transformed yeast cells were not able to bind to the biotinylated surface. This could be due to a several reasons. Firstly, streptavidin monomers could be folded incorrectly. Secondly, functional streptavdin unit composes of four streptavidin monomers, there is only a little chance that four of the displayed monomers will be in the correct conformational positions to form functional streptavidin unit. Thirdly, there might not be enough of biotin molecules on the microfluidic chips for mediating the cell to chip connection. We also decided that expressing both Aga1 and Aga2 with constitutive promoter could be a better idea, as yeast with plasmids using galactose promoters need to grow in a medium containing sacharose/galactose ergo grow slower.

Module 3
The strength of the Anti-EpCAM scFv to EpCAM bond formation was examined. Yeast cells (EBY100) transformed with yeast display plasmid containing EpCAM and Anti-EpCAM scFv inserts were grown in induction medium for 48 hours (20°C).  After induction, cells were thoroughly vortexed to get rid of any pre-formed clumps. Samples containing only the negative control (displaying only Anti-EpCAM scFv) and samples containing both of the yeast types (yeast cells displaying anti-EpCAM scFv and yeast cells displaying EpCAM), were incubated for 5 minutes in 30°C. Solution of the medium and yeast cell aggregates was then qualitatively transferred onto a microscope slide, covered with a coverslip and examined.
We also ran an assay with yeast cells containing plasmids for copper inducible production of mating factor/display of Anti-EpCAM scFv on the surface of the yeast cell and cells containing plasmids for pheromone inducible production of GFP/display of EpCAM. We mixed these cells directly on the microreader (1:1) and induced them with the copper sulfate solution. We also had negative controls, which were cells transformed with the same plasmids except for the yeast display plasmids, therefore they could not bind each other.
Summary: We successfully observed clump formations in the examined samples. Fluorescence in the mixed culture was higher than in the cultures containing only one type of yeast.
