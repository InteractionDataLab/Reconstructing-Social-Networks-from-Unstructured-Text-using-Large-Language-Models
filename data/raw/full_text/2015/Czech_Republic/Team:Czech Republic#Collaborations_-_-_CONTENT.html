We contacted several teams that worked on projects related to our concept during previous years. We were really excited that all of these teams answer to our e-mails. Eventually, our biggest collaboration  has been with team Chalmers Gothenburg from Sweden.
</P><P>Like us, team Chalmers Gothenburg is working with yeast mating pheromone pathway. Their project Study in Scarlet is focusing on detection of contamination using yeasts. <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg">See their wiki for more information.</A></P><P>We had several Skype meetings and exchanged many friendly and helpful e-mails. Team Chalmers Gothenburg showed deep interest in our simulator CeCe. Therefore, we decided to create a simulation of their contamination detection. See our <A href="/Team:Czech_Republic/Software" title="Team:Czech Republic/Software"> Software wiki page</A> or <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg/Simulation">Chalmers Simulation wiki page</A> to see this amazing simulation.
</P><P>Members of Chalmers team also offered us to participate in their Multinational GMO survey. Together we collected 94 survey from general public (50 Czech and 44 Swedish) and 82 from biologist (63 Czech and 19 Swedish). <A href="/Team:Czech_Republic/Practices/GMO_survey" title="Team:Czech Republic/Practices/GMO survey"> See our Human Practice page</A> and <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg/Society">Chalmers Human Practise page</A> for more information. We want to thank to team Chalmers Gothenburg for statistical evaluation of collected data and for providing us the results.
</P><P><B>Biomedical Center of Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen</B></P><P>In order to get a professional opinion on our project and to learn more about cancer and CTCs, we conducted an <A href="/Team:Czech_Republic/Practices/Interview" title="Team:Czech Republic/Practices/Interview"> interview</A> with two cancer specialists, Mgr. Pavel Pitule, Ph.D. and Mgr. Pavel Osta≈°ov, Ph.D. All employees also filled our GMO survey.
</P><P><B>Faculty of Applied Sciences</B></P><P>Since a lot of ideas behind IODs were build on the fundamentals of classical engineering, we presented the concept of our project (from an engineering point-of-view) to young engineers to get their feedback. <A href="/Team:Czech_Republic/Practices/Lecture" title="Team:Czech Republic/Practices/Lecture"> Read about the lecture...</A></P></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV id="footer-container"><DIV id="footer-left"><H1>links out</H1><A target="_blank" href="http://www.ccy.zcu.cz">Georgiev Lab</A><A target="_blank" href="http://www.kky.zcu.cz/en">Department of Cybernetics</A><A target="_blank" href="http://www.ntis.zcu.cz/en/">NTIS Research centre</A><A target="_blank" href="https://www.fav.zcu.cz/en/">Faculty of Applied Sciences</A><A target="_blank" href="https://www.zcu.cz/en/">University of West Bohemia</A></DIV><DIV id="footer-right"><H1>contact</H1><ADDRESS><P>Faculty of Applied Sciences</P><P>Technicka 8</P><P>Pilsen 306 14</P><P>Czech Republic</P><P>georgiev@kky.zcu.cz</P></ADDRESS></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
