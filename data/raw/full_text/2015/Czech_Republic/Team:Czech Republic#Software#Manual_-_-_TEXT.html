Applications
CLI
Simple command line application that can run prepared simulations. It takes simulation file and perform simulation with optional visualization.
Parameters:
Name
Parameters
Description
Notes
simulation-file
filepath
Path to simulation file.
--plugins
Prints a list of available plugins.
--help
Prints help.
--visualize
If simulation should be visualized.

May not be available in some builds. Check --help if is supported.
Specifying --visualize or --novisualize override settings from simulation (some simulation don’t explicitly want visualize).
Keys
When CLI application is running with visualization some keys can be used.
Key
Description
Q
Exits application.
P
Pause simulation.
S
Perform one simulation step when simulation is paused.
How to run
CLI application is supported on all three platforms.
Windows x64
On Windows the ZIP package contains executable in the main directory and some subdirectories with examples and plugins. Application must be executed from command line (cmd or PowerShell).
PS > .\cece-cli.exe examples\showcase.xml
Mac OS X
Application on Mac is shipped as bundle packed in TZG package. Package contains a few directories where the most important is bin where the application is stored. The directory bin/simulator-cli.app contains everything that CLI application needs to be executed. Run it from Finder is not viable (mostly for GUI apps that doesn’t require arguments) so it must be executed from terminal. The bundle have some predefined structure where the executable is stored but it’s not important because there is bin/cece-cli.sh that allows you to run CLI app without knowledge of bundle structure.
Just run the simulator by typing this in terminal in directory of unpacked TZG package.
$ ./bin/cece-cli.sh examples/showcase.xml
Linux x64
We offer only DEB package for Ubuntu-like distributions (Ubuntu 14.10 LTS, Mint 17.2). Just double click on DEB package and everything should be installed. Then just type following into terminal.
$ cece-cli /usr/share/cece/examples/showcase.xml

Data Tables
Data tables are way how the simulator stores data within simulation. Anything can store data in named data table and when simulation ends those data tables are stored into CSV files in current working directory.
All data is stored in memory during simulation and are stored into file when simulation ends. This cause a large memory requirements depending on stored data.
Loaders
Loaders are responsible for loading different type of source files. They understand the source file and create simulation from them.
Reactions
This loader loads simple files that contains reaction rules and some parameters. Syntax of reaction rules is same as stochastic-reaction plugins.
@iterations 500 @dt 1s null > 0.3 > A; A > 0.1 > B + C;
Lines that begins with @ symbol are considered as directives that setups simulation. Remaining lines are parsed by reactions parser and used as program for cell.
Coresponding XML file looks like:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <simulation dt="1s" iterations="500"> <program name="__local__" language="stochastic-reactions-intercellular"> <![CDATA[ null > 0.3 > A;         A > 0.1 > B + C; ]]> </program> <object class="cell.Yeast" programs="__local__" /> </simulation>

XML
Basic and most supported loader. It loads simulation from valid XML file. Some basic knowledge of XML files is required. The simplest simulation file looks like:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?> <simulation dt="1s"> </simulation>
<simulation dt="1s"> </simulation></source> This simulation does almost nothing just runs with iteration time step 1 second.
In the simulation element can be several other elements that specifies the simulation. Those elements can have sub-elements but that mostly depends on element type and used plugin.

Stochastic reactions - Intracellular
Allows to specify reactions rules that are stochastically being executed inside the cell.
The syntax is similar to one in NFSim.
This reaction changes molecule A to molecule B with rate 1. In other words, when this reaction occurs, one molecule A gets substracted and one molecule B gets added.
A > 1 > B;
This reaction changes one molecule A into molecules B and C.
A > 1 > B + C;
If you need reaction to happen only when some other molecule is present, take a look at following reaction. This reaction subtracts A and B, and adds C + B. Therefore, this reaction changes A to C only when B is present. Please note you can’t use this concept with environmental reactions.
A + B > 3 > C + B;
This reaction creates complex C from 2 molecules of A. That means that at least two As are required for this reaction to occur.
A + A > 2 > C;
This reaction uses keyword null and represents expression of A. No molecule gets substracted and one molecule of A gets added.
null > 2 > A;
Similarly, this reaction represents degradation of A.
A > 5 > null;
The two reactions above can be easily rewritten like this using reversible reaction syntax. First rate is rate of reaction going back, and second rate is for reaction going forward.
A < 5, 2 > null; null < 2, 5 > A;
Another keywords which help user to make his reaction rules more understandable are if, and and or.
if not C and D and E:  A + B > 1 > C;
This reaction merges A and B into C, but this reaction can occur only when there is no molecule of C present and simultaneously there must be D and E present. You can combine as many logic combinations as you can. Please note that and is prior to or, this means that following reaction only occur when there is either A or B and C together present in the cell.
if A or B and C: D > 1 > E;
We want to make your reactions easily tunable, so we included the principle of threshold. The following reaction get executed only when there is 500 molecules of B present in the cell.
If B > 500: A > 1 > C;
Example:
Defines reactions that create molecules GFP and A with some degradation.
<parameter name="K1" value="20" /> <program name="make" language="stochastic-reactions-intracellular"><![CDATA[ if A > K1: null > 1.505149978 > GFP;   GFP > 0.001 > null;   null < 0.5, 0.8 > A; ]]></program>
Stochastic reactions - Intercellular
Allows to specify reactions program that happens in surrounding environment. Plugin is an extension of intracellular reactions.
Extension’s functionality lies in keyword env which is abbreviation for environment, which handles absorbing the molecules inside the cell or producing them outside. Please note that env must be alone on its side of reaction rule.
Plugin requires properly set diffusion module with signals that have same name as molecules released into environment.
This plugin extends basic Intracellular reactions functionality with two types of reactions, expression and absorption.
Expression of molecule A is either represented using:
A > 1 > env;
or using:
null > 1 > env_A;
Please note that those two representations are not exactly the same although they lead to the same result. In first example there must be molecule A present in the cell, after executing the reaction the molecule gets substracted and added to the environment. Therefore this reaction represents transportation of molecule outside the cell. In second reaction, the molecule is added and released directly to the environment in single step.
Representation of absorption:
env > 1 > A;
This reaction follows the same concept. Subtracts molecule from environment and adds inside the cell. However, you may not want the molecules to get absorbed, you may only want to detect if those molecules are outside.
if env_A: B > 1 > C;
Extended conditional reactions are the key. Usage is completely the same as you know from standard intracellular reactions, just add the env_ prefix before molecule name. The threshold functionality is of course kept too.
<parameter name="T1" value="20uM" />
if env_A > T1: B > 1 > C;
Example:
This example is production of A molecules and releasing them with some rate into diffusion.
<program name="expression-of-A" language="stochastic-reactions-intercellular"><![CDATA[ null > 50 > env_A; ]]></program>
Streamlines
Module that simulate streamlines in whole scene. It using Lattice Boltzman method to calculate velocities in simulation grid. Simulation can handle static and even dynamic obstacles. Dynamic obstacles are moving objects in scene. Dynamic obstacles (i.e. objects) are affected by computed velocities.
There are some limitations that come from Lattice Boltzman method. Maximum velocity is limited by grid size, time step and scene/world size. If the velocity is higher than this limit, it’s changed to the maximum otherwise the streamlines simulation crashes.
Example:
<module name="streamlines" grid="200" inlet-velocity="300um/s" kinematic-viscosity="0.658mm2/s" />
Parameters:

Simulation grid size.
layout
4x string
barrier outlet barrier inlet
Defines scene layout. Four values define layout in order: top right bottom left. Possible values are: none, barrier, inlet, outlet.
inlet-velocity
unit[m/s]
0
Velocity for all inlets.
inlet-velocities
4x unit[m/s]
0 0 0 0
Specific inlet velocities for layout.
kinematic-viscosity
unit[m2/s]
0.658mm/s
Fluid kinematic viscosity.
Additional modules
store-state
Module that stores velicities from grid into streamlines data table.
Example:
<module name="streamlines.store-state" />
This module generates a huge amount of data so use with caution.
Stored data:
iteration - Iteration number.
totalTime - Simulation time in seconds.
x - Grid X coordinate.
y - Grid Y coordinate.
velX - Velocity in specified grid cell, X coordinate.
velY - Velocity in specified grid cell, Y coordinate.
Additional programs
store-object-state
Module that stores object position and velicities into object-state data table.
Example:
<object ... programs="streamlines.store-object-state" />
Stored data:
iteration - Iteration number.
totalTime - Simulation time in seconds.
id - Object identifier.
x - Object X world coordinate.
y - Object Y world coordinate.
velX - Object velocity, X coordinate.
velY - Object velocity, Y coordinate.
Streamlines Python
Python language binding for streamlines plugin.
Example:
This module generates in every iteration some diffusion signal inside defined circle.
<module name="python:generate"><![CDATA[ layouts = [     ["barrier", "outlet", "barrier", "inlet"],     ["barrier", "inlet", "barrier", "outlet"] ]  mode = 1  def update(dt, simulation):     global mode     module = simulation.useModule("streamlines")      if (simulation.iteration % 200 == 0):         module.setLayout(layouts[mode % 2])         module.initBarriers(simulation)         mode = mode + 1 ]]></module>
