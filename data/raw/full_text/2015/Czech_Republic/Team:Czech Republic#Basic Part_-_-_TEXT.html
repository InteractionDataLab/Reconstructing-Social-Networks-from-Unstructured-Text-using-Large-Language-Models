1 Description
2 Basic Parts
3 Part Collection
3.1 Signals & Receptors
3.2 Yeast reporters
Description
We relied heavily on two promoters from the Registry (pGAL1 and pCUP1), and so we extensively characterized them both and submitted the results to the Registry as a part of the Gold medal requirements.

Basic Parts
Several Basic parts were constructed during the summer. We contributed to the Registry with 8 different basic parts, ready to use in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Function of all these parts was experimentally validated.
We sent 4 different mating pheromones:
Mating pheromone (S. cerevisiae) - BBa_K1690000
Mating pheromone (C. albicans) - BBa_K1690001
Mating pheromone (C. tropicalis) - BBa_K1690002
Mating pheromone (L. elongisporus) - BBa_K1690003
And with the sequences of 2 different pheromone receptors:
Pheromone receptor (C. albicans) - BBa_K1690004
Pheromone receptor (C. parapsilosis) - BBa_K1690005
The BioBricks above were constructed by Module 2, where you can find details of their construction and function .
Also, 3 different reporters ready to use in Saccharomyces were prepared and sent:
pADH1_GFP (Yeast reporter) - BBa_K1690006
pasCYC1v3_GFP (Yeast reporter) - BBa_K1690007
pTv3_GFP (Yeast reporter) - BBa_K1690008
These BioBricks were constructed by Module 1, where you can find details of their construction and function .
Part Collection
Our submitted parts can be divided into two separate collections:
