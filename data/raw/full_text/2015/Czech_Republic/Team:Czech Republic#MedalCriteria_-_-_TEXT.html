Gold Medal
At least two of the following goals:
✓ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab.
✓ Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry.
We have significantly improved the characterization of two inducible promoters in the Registry - the pCUP1 promoter (can be found as BBa_K945002 ) and the pGAL1 promoter (can be found as BBa_J63006 ).
✓ Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
We have helped Team Chalmers Gothenburg with modeling and simulating their system. We also cooperated on Multinational GMO survey .
✓ Choose one of these two options:
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
We have integrated some of the ideas from the Interview with two experts on the CTCs into our project. As recommended we tested the agglutination in the microfluidics chips instead of tubes. Also, for the orthogonality tests in Module 2, we used GFP as the output signal instead of agglutination to make the result more obvious as suggested.
Silver Medal
All of the following goals:
✓ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
✓ Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines.)
✓ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
We addressed these issues on our Human Practices page.
Bronze Medal
All of the following goals:
✓ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We are registered! .
✓ Complete the Judging form.
The Judging form was completed.
✓ Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Team wiki contains the description of our project and all our parts were documented in the Registry.
✓ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Giant Jamboree.
We are going to the Giant Jamboree with a poster and a talk ready.
✓ Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
This page on our team wiki is up and running.
✓ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
We have submitted and documented several parts, for example BBa_K1690000 (the BioBrick numbers we used range from BBa_K1690000 to BBa_K1690008). The documentation can be found in the Registry or at our wiki.
