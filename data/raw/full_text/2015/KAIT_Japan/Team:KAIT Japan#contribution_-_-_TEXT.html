In this page, we show our characterization of existing parts. Characterization of a existing parts is one of Gold medal criteria.  There are many parts in iGEM stock,but some parts sequence are not confirmed by author or Registry. When you use iGEM distribution parts, it is very important whether the part has correct sequence or not.So confirming existing parts seouense is beneficial contribution. Our characterization to existing part will help many igemers in future.
We analyzed a sequence of part: BBa_B0012 (2015kit).
we confirmed the sequence of part,submitted the sample to the Registry, documented our contribution on original parts page.
            
We confirmed sequencing of BBa_B0012(you can see our sequence data).
