We inserted our parts，Dronpa 145N(BBa_K1740000) and Dronpa 145K(BBa_K1740001) into pcold vector. And we expressed Dronpa 145N and Dronpa 145K in Ecoli(DH5α).
Figure1 shows the Ecoli that expressed was bright with 400nm light. We confirmed that Dronpa 145N and Dronpa 145K were bright green fluorescence under 400nm light.  <STRONG>[Purification of Dronpa 145N and 145K]</STRONG>
We purified Dronpa 145N and Dronpa 145K by His-tag purification.
We irradiated Dronpa 145N and Dronpa145K with 400nm light.Both of them were bright green fluorescence.Figure2 show that Dronpa 145N was bright with 400nm light.<STRONG>[SDS-PAGE]</STRONG>
After we purified Dronpa145N and Dronpa 145K by using His-tag purification,we ran these proteins on SDS-PAGE.We analyzed the bands.Figure 3 shows the result of the SDS-PAGE.The 1 lane was the molecular maker. 2 lane and 3 lane were respectively Dronpa 145K and 145N.
The molecure weight of Dronpa is 28.8 kDa. We were able to see the bands that was estimated about 30.0kDa.  
We　concluded that we succeeded expressing and purifying Dronpa 145N and 145K.<STRONG>[Fluorescence intensity]</STRONG>We irradiated 400 nm (5 hours) and 500 nm (5 hours) collectively for Dronpa 145K and 145N., we analyzed for fluorescence intensity of Dronpa 145N and Dronpa 145K. Figure4 shows the result. Initial state Dronpa 145N and 145K had middle fluorescence intensity, irradiated with 500nm light, the fluorescent intensity was decreasing and Dronpa 145N and 145K were not bright green fluorescence. After irradiated with 400nm light, the fluorescent intensity was increasing, Dronpa 145N and 145K were bright green fluorescence.



Fluorescence intensity of Dronpa 145K was bigger  than that of Dronpa 145N in each state. We confirmed that Dronpa’s fluorescence intensity was becoming stronger when we irradiated Dronpa with 400 nm. And it was becoming weaker when we irradiated Dronpa with 500 nm. We proved by specific wavelength.<STRONG>[Native- PAGE]</STRONG>
We irradiated Dronpa 145N with 400 nm (5 hours), 500 nm (5 hours) and 500 nm (5 hours) + 400 nm (10 hours). And we ran these samples on Native-PAGE.Figure8 shows the Native-PAGE. We obtained a large molecular weight band in lane Dronpa 145N (-,- ),Dronpa 145N(-,+),Dronpa145N(+,+). This result showed that Dronpa 145N formed tetramer by 400nm light. We determined that Dronpa 145N formed teteramer, when it was exposed by 400nm light. We also determined Dronpa 145K did not form tetramer. We concluded that Dronpa 145N reversibly changed their olligomerization by light (400 nm(tetramer), 500 nm(monomer)). 
The tetramer band irradiated with 500nm was paler than the tetramer band irradiated with 400nm. The tetramer band irradiated with 500nm+400nm is deeper than the tetramer band irradiated with 500nm. Therefore, Dronpa 145N changed structure by specific light.<STRONG>[Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM)]</STRONG>
We observed E.coli which had Dronpa 145N or 145K using CLSM.Figure9,and Figure10 show the result of CLSM.
Ecoli that expressed Dronpa 145N and 145K were bright green fluorescence when we irradiate Ecoli with 400 nm. These fluorescence were extinguished when we irradiate each ecoi with 500 nm.We concluded Dronpa 145N and 145K worked in our Ecoli.
