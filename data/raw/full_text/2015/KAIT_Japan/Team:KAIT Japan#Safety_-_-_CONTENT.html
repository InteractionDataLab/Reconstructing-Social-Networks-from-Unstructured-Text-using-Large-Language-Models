This bacteria is not harmful and classified and classified Risk group1.We use it to produce many DNA plasmid copies and protein.
We made protein coding parts such as 145K, 145N, lac+RBS+145N,lac+RBS+MCS+145N.
All of the parts are fluorescent proteins and those are no toxicity.
<STRONG>Q2</STRONG>.What is your chassis organism?
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:E.coli
<STRONG>Q3</STRONG>:Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms,besides your chassis?
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:None.
<STRONG>Q4</STRONG>:How will your project work?
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:We try to control protein activity by light using Dronpa.By using this system,we would like to control cell devision and metabolism of E.coli,detect a pollutant.
In this project ,we try to control the Iuciferase activity by the recombinant Dronpa as a model case.Our recombinant Dronpa Change the conformation and form tetramer by 400nm light and dissociate to monomer by 500nm light.We would like to apply the Dronpa by making the fusion luciferase with the Dronpa and the activity will be controlled by light because the protein conformation will depends on the formation of Dronpa.This control system by using Dronpa will be applicable to many enzyme. 
<STRONG>Q5</STRONG>:What risks does your project pose at the laboratry stage?What actions are you taking to reduce these risks?
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:We put on white robe, rubber gloves to preventus from getting hurt.
We have sterilized our used materials by autoclave, ethanol.We have experimented in clean bench to prevent our organism from escaping from lab.
<STRONG>Q6</STRONG>:How would your project be used in the real world?
<STRONG>A</STRONG>:
・Our project is foundational/we do not have a specific real-world application in mind.
 (examples:library of standardzed promoters.system for communication between cells)
・Only in the lab.
 (examples:reporter strain for measuring the strength of promoters)
・In a consumer produst that ordinary peoplebuy.
 (examples:cells that clean your clothes, bread made with engineered yeast)
・In agriculture/on a farm.
 (examples:cells that guard against pests, engineered rice plants,cells that promote growth of crop plants)
・In the natural environment.
 (examples:cells that remove pollution from lakes,engineered forest trees that can resist drought)
<STRONG>Q7</STRONG>:What risks might your project pose,if it were fully developed into a real project that real people could use?What future work might you do to reduce those risks?<STRONG>A</STRONG>:It need blue lights to express Dronpa(fluorescent protein).If you watch blue lights directly,you hurt your eyes.
<STRONG>Q8</STRONG>:Any futher comments about your project.<STRONG>A</STRONG>:Our project is very simple and easy.Also it widely applicable.
<STRONG>Q9</STRONG>:Comments about this form:Is it easy or difficult to use?Are the questions confusing?<STRONG>A</STRONG>:None.
