Abstract
~Control protein activity by light~
  Our project is control protein activity by light.
  Controlling protein activity by light is important for analyzing protein function and controlling synthetic biology systems.However, previous methods require co factor or use toxic blue light.We need more usable method to control synthesized biological systems.
  There is a noble method that doesn't require co factor and use toxic blue light.The method use mutant of a fluorescent protein, Dronpa.
  We think this method solve previous problems and contribute controlling synthetic biology systems. But there is not enough quantitative data.So,we will exam and modify this method. After that, we will show light controlling biological system by using this method.
