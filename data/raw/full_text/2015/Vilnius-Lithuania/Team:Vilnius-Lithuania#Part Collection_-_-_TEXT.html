Part collection
We successfully made a collection of parts, that are the core substances in our project, also they encode the main components of the DNA degradation stage of I-F type CRISPR-Cas system. These parts  are a part of our functional unit (BBa_K1773003 ; BBa_K1773005), which is Cas3 protein and Cascade complex, respectively. Also we made these parts of different expression strengths, by adding different strength RBS sites, so that modulation of protein expression can be obtained, if needed. Another important factor, that these parts have a pLux/cI right promoter, which is regulated by our regulatory unit. The parts are BBa_K1773016 BBa_K1773017 BBa_K1773018 and BBa_K1773022 BBa_K1773023 BBa_K1773024 for Cas3 and Cascade respectively. Lastly, we produced an intermediate part of our regulatory unit (BBa_K1773026), which is also an important contribution to our project, and will be beneficial to other projects, which will use LUX regulatory systems.
