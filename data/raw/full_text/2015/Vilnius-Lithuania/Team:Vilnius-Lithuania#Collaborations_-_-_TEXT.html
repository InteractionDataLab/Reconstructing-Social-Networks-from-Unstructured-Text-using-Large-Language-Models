Meetup with SDU
We are very happy to have other iGEM teams around ours. As early as June 3rd, we hosted SDU team (Denmark) in Lithuania. We gained advices on organizational activities, lab work and wiki webpage. Moreover, we shared the usable information on topics, such as CRISPR/Cas systems, microfluidics and modular proteins (interactions between them and nucleic acids). We also organized a tour around Thermofisher Scientific Lithuania. Check out some more details of our meetup here . This great partnership did not end after their trip. As one biobrick ( BBa_I0462 ) was damaged in our kit, SDU team helped us by sending their sample of this biobrick. Thank you SDU team!
Biobrick collaboration with Toulouse
After we were given a hand by SDU team, we had an opportunity to help a great team of Toulouse iGEM. At the end of a summer, they told us that they need a specific construct ( BBa_K195613 ). Luckily, we were able to build it. Even more, we did some characterization of this part. It was already in a Registry of Standard Biological Parts, but has been poorly characterized. We sent this biobrick to France and hope that Toulouse team did a great job using it.
Meeting Paris Bettencourt
Dealing with French people doesn’t end this way. Our team member Mykolas visited one of the greatest iGEM teams and gained the experience from Paris Bettencourt . Impression of the structure of a team was inspiring for us, so after this visit on July we were more motivated to make this experience a part of our team routine.
Questionnaires
As the Beatles notice, with a little help from my friends, we filled in a lot of questionnaires and shared data from our ones. These questionnaires asked about GMOs, the attitude and acceptance of genetic modifications’ technologies.  We are happy to share this info with iGEM Tec-Monterrey , Vanderbilt iGEM and Oxford iGEM teams. Moreover, after long analyses of our date and our own questionnaires from Lithuania society, we shared the data and insights among various GMO councils and the Ministry of Environment of the Lithuania.
Video collaborations
To further broaden our communication with other iGEM teams, we shared our video on WikiFlicks project, created by UCSF iGEM team. Relationship with other teams means much to us and we really appreciate the effort from other teams to integrate us, first-timers, to the community of iGEM.
