Publicity
During the time of our project, we got a lot of attention from local press and other media channels. This was quite an important part of publical outreach - we are the first team to come from Lithuania, so we wanted to trigger more curiousity about iGEM competition and synthetic biology in general. We could not thank more for OMConsulting for their invaluable help to reach out to information channels.
