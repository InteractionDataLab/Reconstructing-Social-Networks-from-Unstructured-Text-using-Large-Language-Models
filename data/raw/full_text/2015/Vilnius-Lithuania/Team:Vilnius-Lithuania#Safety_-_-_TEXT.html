Our iGEM safety achievements
We submitted "About our lab" and "About our project" surveys by June 26th
We submitted "Final Safety Form" survey by August 28th
Safety training
Before we started working on our project in the lab, we were given a comprehensive safety training, concerning issues such as working with hazardous chemicals, electrical equipment, biological materials and others. Training also included general laboratory safety – wearing protective clothing (lab coats) and gloves at all times, using goggles when necessary, taking care of various chemicals,  sterilizing and cleaning the lab, in order to prevent any possible contamination, handling the equipment.
Goggles when necessary!
Project safety
When planning a project, the team of scientists should carefully think about how their achievements will be applied in real life by the society. Will the team construct a device that could be used by public? Or will the team create a laboratory system, which could be used by other scientists?
Our project is applicable for the second option. Coliclock is a system, which can be used by scientists in other laboratories, in other words, our users will be highly proficient people, possesing specific skills.
All the parts we used throughout our project are not toxic or dangerous for the environment. Throughout our project we used these strains:
BL21-DE3 E. coli
JM109 E. coli
DH5α E.coli
One Shot® TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli
