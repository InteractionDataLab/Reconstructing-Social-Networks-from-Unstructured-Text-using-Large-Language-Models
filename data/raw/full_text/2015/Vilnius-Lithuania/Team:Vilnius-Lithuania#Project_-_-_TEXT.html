Description
We created Coliclock - a bacterial system, which helps to limit the spreading of GMOs in nature. To construct our system we used I-F type CRISPR-Cas mechanism, which contains Cascade complex, cas3 protein and crRNA genes. Click below to find out more.
Design
Coliclock was designed by crea­ting regulatory and functional units. Regulatory unit consists of pLux/cI promoter, LuxI, LuxR, pLac operon and cI repressor. Functional unit consists of Casca­de complex, Cas3 protein and crRNR genes. Click below to find out more.
Application
We wanted to show how efficient our system could be if it was applied to practice. For this reason we selected a few projects from iGEM competition and discussed, how could our Coliclock system be incorporated in them. Click below to find out more.
Modeling
We explained our project by creating a simple scheme. This scheme shows and predicts concentration differences of Cas3 and Cascade proteins. More important, a scheme describe results, which are expected after we add IPTG in a laboratory environ­ment. Click below to find out more.
Results
During our project we achieved our goals to create functioning system. We fully cloned functional unit and achieved most of the work with the regulatory unit. Click below to find out more.
