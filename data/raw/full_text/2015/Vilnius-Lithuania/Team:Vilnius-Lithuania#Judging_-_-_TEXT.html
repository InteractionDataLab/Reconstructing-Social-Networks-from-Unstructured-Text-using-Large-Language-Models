Achievements:
We had a great summer. We are happy to be the first iGEM team from Lithuania and we are super exited about attending the Giant Jamboree.
Check out our Judging form here .
This is our wonderful wiki page . Welcome! We documented our team’s parts using Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
We are ready to present a poster and a talk at the Giant Jamboree!
Check out our clear and detailed list of attributions .
We documented 13 new BioBricks at iGEM Parts Registry. Our wiki page for parts is here . BioBricks for bronze medal: BBa_K1773003 , BBa_K1773005 , BBa_K1773012 , BBa_K1773016 , BBa_K1773017 , BBa_K1773018 , BBa_K1773019 , BBa_K1773020 , BBa_K1773021 , BBa_K1773026 .
Silver
Achievements:
Western immunoblotting with anti His6 sequence was performed to validate three biobricks: BBa_K1773022, BBa_K1773023 and BBa_K1773024. Proteins were generated and detected. Experiment was successful and we have obtained expression of Cascade construct. We also conducted in vivo experiments with BBa_K1773022, where we showed that this biobrick works just as expected – it attacks cell host genomic DNA, when other needed parts are present, and causes cell death. For more information check out our results .
We registered 4 biobricks for this criteria. They are: BBa_K1773022 , BBa_K1773023 and BBa_K1773003 .
When we were brainstorming our ideas, we noticed one big fear of lithuanian people. GMO usage affects us every day and the biggest fear is that GMO may be uncontrolled. There is a possibility that GMOs will spread or mutate after some time in the environment. We created a system that controlls GMOs. With this system GMOs can be used safely. It can take away a fear and let us use modified organisms in many ways. Also controlling modifed organism can take away a tense between scientists and society. With this project we created an essencial dialogue between two groups of people.
We done a lot of things, which proves that we are worth to win a medal:
We created a discussion in Cafe Scientifique;
We visited high scools, gave lectures there and created discussions.
More information about our human practices activity is in our wiki .
Gold
Achievements:
Our project – Coliclock – is a system that can control GMOs. After the discusions with students we received the information that we and sociaty itself needs more knowledge and education about GMOs, so we had a meeting with GMO committee of Lithuania. It was necessary to understand laws about to GMO and attitude of the society. Also we made a survey and asked lithuanian people their opinion about GMO. As a conclusion we can say that our project, which is associated with GMO, was a good choice (especially in Lithuania) and helped us to crystalize the idea. We understood that people have to work on genetically engineerd organisms – not only create them, test them, use them, but also to control them.
Things, we have done to achieve gold medal:
we analyzed lithuanian people answers of the survey;
we have met with the GMO committee.
More information about our human practices activity is in our wiki .
We cloned a biobrick BB_K195613 for Toulouse team .We also collaborated with other teams by filling in their surveys. We have met SDU team from Denmark.
We charachterized BBa_R1051 biobrick by investigating its interaction with the product of BBa_K077039 biobrick. BBa_R1051 is a GFP expressing device that can be repressed by cI protein. We obtained data, which indicates that BBa_R1051 is indeed repressible in vivo conditions by cI and we also hypothesize that even cI production from BBa_K077039 biobrick is highly unpredictable in our conditions.
