Other attributions
iGEM competition takes a lot of effort and hardwork to participate in. According to these circumstances, our team is sure that without some people Vilnius iGEM team would have been impossible. In a week or two here you will see is a list of the people that we are very grateful to. Project support and advices for team establishment were received from many people, including academic society and political figures.
General support
We are giving our sincere thank you to prof. Eugenijus Butkus (a prorector of Vilnius University), the dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences prof. Osvaldas Rukšėnas and a vice dean assoc. prof. Jurga Turčinavičienė and the founder of “We love Lithuania” campaign Simonas Rudaminas. Even Gediminas Miškinis, a chancellor of the Ministry of Economy, expressed a great support for us and gave some advices. We would be still searching a place to live and some other headaches will still be, if not Romena Savickienė. With a help of her, the embassy of Lithuania in the USA (Justina Krutulytė, Laura Šerenienė, Rolandas Kriščiūnas) and the worldwide society of  lithuanians (Dalia Shilas and Dalia Henke) we found home to live during the conference. Big thanks also go to "Baltic Clippers" tourism and travel company and especially Tatjana Pavlova, who helped us to catch the best flight offers. We are kindly grateful for Vilnius Tourism and Information center for their booklets about Lithuania. We want to thank Association of Lithuanian Natural Sciences Olympiad, together with Vilius Malūnavičius and Rūta Leinartaitė for helping us out with the technical paperwork.
Laboratory support
For every kind of advices we are saying a big thank you to a mathematician Irus Grinis, the bioinformatics team at the Institute of Biotechnology (dr. Visvaldas Kairys and dr. Darius Kazlauskas) We got big help with the modeling from Juozas Gordevičius. During the hard days in the lab we are grateful for having an opportunity to seek for advices from our principal investigator prof. Virginijus Šikšnys, prof. Rolandas Meškys, dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas, PhD. Justas Lazutka, dr. Tomas Šinkūnas and PhD. Inga Songailienė. The InterLab Measurement project would have been be much harder without the advices from prof. Edita Sužiedelienė and Julita Armalytė. Big thanks go to PhD. Inga Songailienė for sharing laboratory techniques such as fluorescence measurements, Western blot and others.
Fundraising support
To achieve the required funds would be even much harder without "Enterprise Lithuania" advices and financial support from our prime sponsors “Thermofisher Scientific” in a friendly communication of dr. Egidijus Jaseliūnas, as well as “Neurotechnology” with a well-organized sponsorship by Algimantas Malickas and Irmantas Naujikas and Vilnius University. Moreover, we were not only generally supported by Vilnius University. They also helped us at the very beginning to pay the team registration fee. For the quick help with some kit’s and primers we are more than thankful for “Linea libera” with Sigitas Burinskas in front of it, and Lina Piešinienė, who helped with primers from “Nanodiagnostika”.
Not only huge companies can help you with the fundraising – the greatest and the warmest person we met is Alina Bezuglova and her teammate Aurelija Degulytė. Our first meeting would have been impossible without a help from Vytautas Bivainis and Vytautas Kalinauskas. Some insights were shared by Rūta Kruliauskaitė, who did a probably the most succeeded  crowdfunding campaign for her studies at New York City.
Public outreach support
The great project manager at the Enterprise Lithuania – Raminta Kaleinikaitė and a trainee Sonata Brokevičiūtė, who also helped us with the presentation skills. How to rule the world of society and make us a well-known project? Please seek for an advice at “OMConsulting” and our the best advisor Milda Gaulienė and for the first business card we got – thank you Orijana Mašalė (the owner of "OMConsulting"). All the publications and all the requests for financial support would have been less successful without your help. After the sneaky preview of presentations we could join a huge events at our friends “LITEXPO” place and in the pleasure of that we can collaborate with the “Baltic Innovative Technology Institute” (Tomas Žalandauskas). Also, the press of Vilnius University was much more than friendly to us, so thank you, Agnė Grinevičiūtė. Interested topics were presented by PhD. Aleksandr Osipenko, PhD. Robertas Galinis and dr. Giedrius Gasiūnas to our team and our guests from danish SDU team.
Design support
To paint the face of our team, after all the team members opinions and some designs by Danielius, we are thankful for the greatest camera-man Evaldas Valaitis (and all the editing work), PhD. Linas Tamošaitis, for our painter Monika Jasnauskaitė for an illustration for innovation fair and photographer Paulius Mielinis for taking the good quality pictures. Extremely big thanks goes to Monika Kairevičiūtė for drawing beautiful icons for our wiki page.
Webdesign
The Vilnius iGEM website was coded and designed by team member Danielius Dvareckas. After coding website he explained to other team members how to use this code and make additional content changes. To wiki design also contributed other team members by suggesting wiki tweaks.
Graphic elements used on index page four boxes (just below the slider) and judging form were drawn by Monika Kairevičiūtė. Diagrams in descriptions were drawn by team member Ieva Savickytė. Icons used in footer were taken and re-designed to match wiki design from free stock icons website. All drawing and stock icons were retouched by Danielius Dvareckas using open source vector software Inkscape.
Twitter Bootstrap 3 (v3.3.1) - sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier responsive web development. normalize.css was used to reset the wiki style.
jQuery (v1.11.3) is a powerful JavaScript extension library.
History.js was used to ensure compatibility with HTML4 browsers, that do not support history.pushState().
Slimbox 2 (v2.05) was used as a picture viewer. The code had to be adapted to work with the wiki and bxSlider. TU-Munich (2013) had already solved this issue, so modified slimbox 2 version by TU-Munich (2013) was used.
bxSlider (v4.1.1) is a JavaScript library which allowed to add slider on wiki front page.
