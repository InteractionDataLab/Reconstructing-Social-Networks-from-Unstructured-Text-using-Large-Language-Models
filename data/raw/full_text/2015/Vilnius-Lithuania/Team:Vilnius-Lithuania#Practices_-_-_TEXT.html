Education
To achieve our educational goals we made the contact with the scien足tific and non-scientific socie足ty. We visited schools all around the country and did a small research on what myths about genetically modified products are popular amongst the people. Click below to find out more about those events.
Collaborations
During our project we collaborated with several other iGEM teams. We helped to characterize parts, filled in various question sheets, met up with the members of other teams! Click below to find out more.
Ethics
Our team is more than sure, that it is essential to bring the topics of synthetic biology to daylight. We developed some serious discus足sions about genetically modified organisms and their usage, con足ducted a survey and asked for opinions from different background people. Click below to find out more.
Events
We organized a few events, related with the topic of our project, such as Cafe Scientifique, where we talked about synthetic biology, and discussion with commity of GMO of Lithuania, where we exchanged views about GMO usage and legislation in Lithuania.
