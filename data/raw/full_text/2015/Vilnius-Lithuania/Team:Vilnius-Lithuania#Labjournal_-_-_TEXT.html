Conclusions and Results:
08 26 – Transformation successful.
08 27 – Transformation unsuccessful.
08 29 – JM109 grown successfully. Transformation of P30 into empty JM109 was successful.
08 30 – Transformation unsuccessful.
08 31 - Transformation unsuccessful. The samples could have been pollen.
09 01 – Transformation unsuccessful. Maybe it was too much antibiotic on a petri dish.
09 02 – Transformation successful.
09 03 – Bad fluorimeter options.
09 07 – No repeated samples were made.
09 11 – Fluorescence measurement seems successful.
09 12 – Mistake found. P30 and P20 fragments are in an uncompetable plasmids. Repeating whole experiment.
09 14 - Transformation successful. Colony PCR successful.
09 17 - Fluorescence measurements are successful and conclusive.
