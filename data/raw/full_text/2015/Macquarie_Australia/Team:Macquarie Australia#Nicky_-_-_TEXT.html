The 4166 bp ChlH gene was engineered synthetically by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) into 3 gene blocks (Table 1). The gene sequence was originally from Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii and codon optimized for expression in Escherichia coli.

Attempted assembly of ChlH fragments into CAM and KAN backbones via Gibson Assembly
Amplified GA mix to check whether gblocks had successfully been assembled. 3 sets of primers were used (table 2).
Ran amplicons on a 1% agarose gel with GelRed. If assembly was successful, a band around 4.2 kbp is expected.
No DNA evident on gel

260/280 values indicate isolated DNA was of fairly high quality.
Performed first round of double restriction digests with EcoRI and EcoRI + PstI, and ran product on a gel to determine if ChlH had been successfully assembled by last weeks Gibson Assembly.
Ran restriction products on a 1% gel stained with GelRed. Gel indicated that assembly was unsuccessful.
Assembly may have failed due to poor overlap between part G13 and the KAN vector (11 bp) and the KAN biobrick vector. Potentially there is also insufficient overlap between the KAN vector and part 3-6 (19 bp). Optimal overlap for Gibson Assembly is 15 - 30 bp.

Attempted new assembly of ChlH via restriction digest and ligation for parts G13, 3-6 and KAN vector
3-6-------------------------KAN vector-----------------------G13 (5.4 kb length)
Expect an approximately 5kb band on gel if assembly is successful
Method:
2x Master Digest Mix
Master Digest Mix
4 uL 10x Buffer for EcoRI and PstI
14 uL water
1 uL EcoRI
1 uL PstI
Digest protocol
2.5 uL linearised vector
1 uL each gblock (G13 and 3-6)
4.5 uL digest master mix
Incubate at 37 C for 1 hour and heat inactivate at 80 C for 15 min
Ligation Protocol
9 uL 2x T4 Ligase buffer to digest mix
1 uL T4 DNA ligase
incubate at 25 C for 20 min, 37 C for 20 min and heat inactivate at 80 C for 10 min
Ran digest products on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed
Approx 5kb band evident - seems as though gblocks G13 and 3-6 were ligated to the linearized KAN vector (figure 1).
Attempted assembly of P2 with other gblocks and KAN vector via Gibson Assembly
Performed PCR on GA product, and ran amplicon on a gel to check for successful ChlH assembly
Only primer dimers were visualised on the gel. Will check for assembly via restriction digest next week.
Thursday 20th August 2015
Transformed assembly products into competent E.coli cells and spread these cells onto plates with KAN antibiotic.

Thursday 3rd September 2015
Performed double restriction digests on 38 isolated plasmids - 18 from yesterday, 28 from last week with EcoRI and EcoRI + PstI. 2 samples from yesterday (1 and 16) were disregarded due to low DNA concentration.
Ran digest products on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed to visualise whether ChlH was present.
For sample 17, we obtained a single digest band at around 6 kb which corresponds to the linearized vector, and 2 double digest bands at 4 kb and 2 kb, corresponding to the expected size of ChlH and the vector respectively (Figure 4). Only sample 17 worked.
Plated out the remaining liquid culture for sample 17
Transformed cells with sample 17 isolated plasmid
Set up a sequencing reaction for sample 17 with primers BB-VF2 and BB-VR (Table 2) and sent it off for sequencing
Monday 7th September 2015
Performed plasmid preps on 5 colonies grown from the remaining liquid culture for sample 17

Attempted Backbone switch for ChlH from KAN to CAM via standard 3A assembly
transformed into BL21 origami cells
Backbone switch showed no growth on LB-CAM.
Monday 14 September
Backbone switch for ChlH from KAN to CAM
500 ng of ChlH was digested with 25ng of psb1C3 (CAM) with EcoRI and PstI. Ligase was then added and the ligation products were transformed into competent cells. The cells were then plated out onto LB-CAM media.
Conducted PCR with primers for ChlH (table 8) to check that the part had been assembled in the correct order.
Wednesday 16 September
A gel of the primer tests for ChlH was run and it was clear that too much DNA had been loaded. The PCR was repeated with a diluted ChlH template and these products were run on another gel. However, no products were seen on the gel.
Table with primer pair and expected sizes
