Burpey: The team refers to me as their Hydrogen Hero, aww shucks - I'm just trying to do my bit for the planet. What great weather today, lots of sunshine - my favourite. The colourful building behind me is our campus Library. This is a special building not only because it has robots but because it has a green roof to capture rainwater!
