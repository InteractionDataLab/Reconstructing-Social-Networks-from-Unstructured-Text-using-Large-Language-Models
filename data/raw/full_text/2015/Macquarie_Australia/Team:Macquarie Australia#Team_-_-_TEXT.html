We are Macquarie_Australia
Yes that’s right - we are from the land down under.  In the Southern Hemisphere it is not only cylones that run the opposite way, our Summer break runs between December - February.  Alas our Winter break (29th June - 24th July) was the only time that we could dedicate to iGEM outside of semester.
We are not your typical iGEM team. This is partly due to team membership being integrated into coursework.  Our instructors Louise Brown and Robert Willows wrote a journal article about the strategies and challenges for iGEM teams in the Southern Hemisphere.
