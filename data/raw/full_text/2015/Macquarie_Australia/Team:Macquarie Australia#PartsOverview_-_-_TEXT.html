Parts Overview
Part Documentation
We have designed and constructed 10 parts this year, 5 of which have been submitted to iGem HQ.
BBa_K1640018 , aka ChlM, is a part integral to our synthetic chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, which we have redesigned from earlier submissions, and have functionally characterised. This part has been submitted, and we are claiming a silver medal for this part.
Parts BBa_K1640008 , BBa_K1640020 , BBa_K1640006 and BBa_K1640012 (respectively psbMZH, psbA, psbELJ, and psbQR) are 4 of the 10 biobricks we have designed for synthetic production of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii's photosystem II complex. These 4 parts have been submitted to iGem HQ and we are claiming our bronze medal for these new submissions.
