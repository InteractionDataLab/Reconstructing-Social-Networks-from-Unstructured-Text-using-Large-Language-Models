Burpey: The team refers to me as their Hydrogen Hero, aww shucks - I'm just trying to do my bit for the planet. What great weather today, lots of sunshine - my favourite. The colourful building behind me is our campus Library. This is a special building not only because it has robots but because it has a green roof to capture rainwater!

"I am undertaking my Master of Research at Macquarie, where I am also a lab demonstrator. I advised the 2014 team and experienced iGEM as a student myself in 2013 when I was a part of the Macquarie_Australia team, "Green is the new Black". While I happen to have worn this same shirt in my photo last year it is only one in my collection of nerd shirts."
(Mike Gibbs - Sydney, Australia)
"After the phenomenal success of our team last year, I am back again as an advisor. I graduated at the start of the year, and I just began working as a Business Development Associate for an executive advisory firm. I love my fitness and music; you will always find me with headphones on while I am working!"
(Robbie Hewetson - Sydney, Australia)
