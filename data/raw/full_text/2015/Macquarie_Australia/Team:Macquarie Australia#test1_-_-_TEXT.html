Project Description
 
Our project has its focus on photosynthesis - the natural process where plants and algae convert sunlight into usable energy. By developing artificial photosynthesis in a biological system we can better harvest the unlimited supply of solar energy. The long-term goal is to engineer bacteria that can produce hydrogen gas on an industrial scale.
 
This year the aim of our team is to engineer bacteria to manufacture chlorophyll, the primary molecule of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll harvests light and is involved in the excitation transfer of energy. Chlorophyll-a can be synthesised via a pathway from the protoporphyrin-IX molecule. By placing 13 genes into 4 biobrick vectors we can recreate the pathway in Escherichia coli.
