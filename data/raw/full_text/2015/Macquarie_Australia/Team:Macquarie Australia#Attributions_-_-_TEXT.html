The Macquarie University 2015 iGEM team would like to thank Macquarie University for the support they have made available for our team, including materials, laboratories and personnel. We would also like to thank everyone from the Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences (CBMS) for their continuous support and encouragement towards this year's iGEM Project. The 2015 Macquarie University iGEM Team would additionally like to thank the 2013 and 2014 Macquarie University iGEM Teams for their parts and advice in this project. We are building substantially on their projects by adding Photosystem II and completing the Chlorophyll Biosynthesis pathway
Students
This year our iGEM team was divided into few major groups. The Chlorophyll-a Biosynthesis Team , who devoted their time to correct, verify and characterize the previously submitted biobricks; the Photosystem II Team , who designed and built the world’s first proteins for this process; the ChlH Team , who took it upon themselves to spend endless hours in the lab to ensure the completion of this core component of our project; the Modelling Team , who modelled the production of protoporphyrin-IX from ALA, and the synthesis of Photosystem II in E. coli; the Business Implementation Strategy Team , who reached out to industry and designed a portable, renewable source of H2 gas fuel; the Outreach Team , who coordinated our public engagement activities and collaborations; and the Wiki & Graphics Design Team, who built and updated our wiki. To learn more about each member of our iGEM team, please visit our team page .
Instructors and Advisors
Our team would like to say a special thanks to our instructors and advisors:
Dr. Louise Brown for her constant presence and guidance in the laboratory and her input towards all areas of human practice.
Associate Professor Robert Willows for his invaluable laboratory input and interpretation of this year’s modeling project.
Professor Ian Paulsen, who prepared our team for Boston, and for continuously giving his time in both Human Practice activities and answering questions in all areas of microbial physiology.
Professor Nicki Packer for her help towards funding our project, and supporting our team’s emotional journey.
Dr. Jennifer Hallinan for her input and continuous support towards our modeling project.
Edward Moh for constantly pushing us towards success, for his endless hours spent in the lab and answering any questions about chlorophyll-a and synthetic biology in general.
Michael Gibbs for leading this year's Photosystem II Team, and the endless hours he spent in the lab supervising and answering any question put forward by our team members.
Amit Bhattacharjee is one of our key advisors for this year's team, we would like to thank him for his continuous support and endless hours spent guiding our team’s human practice activities.
Thi Huynh for the amazing ability to find any and all laboratory materials needed by this year’s iGEM Team and her friendly support around the clock.
Rob Hewetson, who devoted many hours towards this year's Business Implementation Project.
Additional Acknowledgements
Our team would additionally like to thank the following people and institutions for their support:
