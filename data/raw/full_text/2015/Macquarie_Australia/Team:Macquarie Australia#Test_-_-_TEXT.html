Overview
The Macquarie iGEM team aims to develop artificial photosynthesis in a biological system harvest the unlimited supply of solar energy. By engineering the biosynthetic pathway for chlorophyll-a, we are taking the first step towards developing the entire photosystem II in the hope of generating hydrogen gas. The industrial potential lies in the ability of channelling this hydrogen gas to develop a renewable energy source. The project aims to engineer the essential genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a into E. coli.
About our hero
Let me introduce myself: My name's Zozor. I was born on 23 November 2005.
A bit meager, is it not? This is why I've now decided to write my biography to let my readers know who I really am.
