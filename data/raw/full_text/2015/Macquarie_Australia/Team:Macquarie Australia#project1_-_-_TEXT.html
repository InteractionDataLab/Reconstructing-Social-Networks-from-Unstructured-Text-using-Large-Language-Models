Plasmid prep of:
Chlm + lac + LB-CAM (x4);
Chli1 + lac + CAM (x4);
lac + Chlp AMP (x3);
lac + YCF54 + AMP (x3);
lac + CTH1 + AMP (x3);
Plasto + lac + CAM (x4);
ChlD + lac + CAM (x4),
DVR1 + lac + CAM (x4);
lac + POK + AMP (x3)
lac+CHL1+YCF54 CAM - DNA Extraction
4 Colonies - plasmid prep
Digested
1 Enzyme - Linearised - EcoR1
2 Enzymes - Double Digest - EcoR1 +Xba1
Next week: Run on gel
Plasmid prep of liquid cultures of lac composite parts (ChlD, ChlM, DVR1, Chli1, Plasto), followed by nanodrop.
Attempted to build lac composite parts
Digest 2ug of lac plasmid with SpeI and PstI followed by PCR cleanup
Digest 100ng of ChlD, ChlM, DVR1, Chli1 and Plasto with Xba1 and PstI using fast AP
Ligated 50ng of digested lac plasmid with gene parts in a gene:lac 3:1 molar ratio
Tuesday 4 August
Transformed ligations from the 30th of July
Ran gel of lac + CTH1 + YCF54 restriction digests
Wednesday 5 August
Restriction digest of plasmid preps from 30th July
Thursday 6 August
Plasmid prep of liquid cultures of lac + gene parts transformed on the 4th August.
Ran gel of restriction digests of lac + gene parts (ChlM, ChlD, ChlP, YCF54, CTH1, Plasto, Chli1, DVR1, POR, CTH1+YCF54) from yesterday.
Gel results made no sense so re-digested the above parts for a second round of screening and conducted a PCR using gene specific primers for all except YCF54 and Plasto.
Ran gel of second restriction digests and PCR products.
DNA Extraction and plasmid prep
ChlM CAM (4 colonies)
DVR1 CAM (5 colonies)
Plasto CAM (4 colonies)
Digested all with:
1 Enzyme - Linearised - EcoR1
2 Enzymes - Double Digest - EcoR1 +Pst1
Plasmid prep of: Chlm 1.1-1.6 (1.4 missing),Gun4+lac(2.1-2.3), and Gun4+lac (Amp)(3.1-3.2);
Digestion enzymes: Plasmids were digested using:
EcoRI
EcoRI + SpeI (Double digestion)
Samples were purified using gel purification.
Plasmid prep, and nanodrop, of: Chld 1.1-1.4, ChlI1 2.1-2.4, ChlI1+lac 3.1-3.2, ChlI2+lac 4.1-4.2, Gun4+lac B1, Gun4+lac B2, Gun4+lac B1(sh), Gun4+lac B2 (sh)
Enzyme digestion followed by gel elecrophoresis
Single digest with EcoRI
Double digest with EcoRI + SpeI
Thursday 13th August
PCR amplification, followed by gel electrophoresis, to make composite parts of;
lac+ChlD
lac + Gun 4
lac + Chlm
lac + ChIg
BioBrick 3A Assembly method to make composite parts of;
lac+ChlD
lac + Gun4
lac + ChlM
plasto+ChlM
lac+ChlG
~5ùùªg of lac promoter plasmids were digested with SpeI and PstI and ~8ùùªg were digested with EcoRI and PstI. These digested plasmids were then gel purified for use in the construction of the composite parts listed above.
Double Digest (XbaI + Pst1), followed by gel electrophoresis for purification, of;
ChlD
Gun4
ChlM x2
ChlG
Thursday 20 August
Digest of;
Chli2 (XbaI + Pst1)
Chli1 (SpeI + Pst1)
ChlD (SpeI + Pst1)
Plasto (SpeI + Pst1)
Plasmid preps of successful E. coli transformants from BioBrick 3A Assembly followed by PCR (due to low nucleic acid concentration) and gel electrophoresis of;
Lac + ChlM
Plasto + Chlm
Gel electrophoresis showed no products
Competent cells were transformed with Lac+ChlM composite gene parts and plasto+ChlM parts which were used in the original successful transformants
A number of ligations were undertaken in order to build a variety of composite parts. Firstly, we ligated 25ng of digested lac plasmid from last week with the following gene parts;
ChlD (75ng)
GUN4 (50ng)
ChlM (50ng)
ChlG (50ng)
These ligations occurred at 37oC for one hour, with an 80oC incubation to deactivate the enzyme. Once complete, the ligation products were transformed into competent cells and plated onto CAM media.
These digested parts listed above were also ligated as seen below;
25ng of Chli1 + ChlD with 25ng of Chli2
25ng of ChlM with 25ng of Plasto
25ng of digested lac promoter from last  week with 50ng of ChlG PCR product.
These ligation products were also transformed into competent cells and plated onto the appropriate media.
