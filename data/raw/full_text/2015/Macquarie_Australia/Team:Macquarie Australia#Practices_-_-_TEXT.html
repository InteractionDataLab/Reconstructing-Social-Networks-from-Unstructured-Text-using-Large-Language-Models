Human Practices
Macquarie University took up the challenge of spreading the word of synthetic photosynthesise to all, focusing on a ‘science for everyone approach’. Therefore, a key aspect of our project is to increase the dialogue between synthetic biologists, industry and society.  To execute this, our team reached out to industry through the Business Implementation Strategy, collaborated with other iGEM teams, engaged the public in So You Think You Can Synthesise, dispelled common myths about chlorophyll and its uses. Additionally, we also started the first Transcontinental iGEM Internship Program in Australia
