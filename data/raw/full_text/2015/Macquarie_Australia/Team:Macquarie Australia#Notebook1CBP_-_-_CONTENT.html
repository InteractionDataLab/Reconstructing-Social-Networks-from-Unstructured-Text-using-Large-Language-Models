Gel electrophoresis of the PCR products from the slower cycle.
<UL><LI>As seen below, ChlD did not amplify, the ChlG band appeared to be too small and the DVR1+ChlP band was also anomalous. All other bands appeared to be correct. (Note: the ladder was too concentrated and should be diluted in future.)</LI></UL>

Screening of products
<UL><LI>We ran a gel of the PCR products of the longer cycle from Thursday July 2. DVR1+ChlP+ChlG composite part amplified and there seems to be a problem with amplification of ChlD. Given ChlD high GC content, a high-GC enhancing buffer may be required.</LI></UL>

Image 7: <I>ChlM seems to have been successfully inserted into BioBrick backbones; ChlH doesnâ€™t.</I><UL><UL><LI>A number of our genes do not have promoters and for this reason both the lac promoter and T7 promoter from the iGEM kits were transformed into competent cells and plated out onto LB-CAM. If successful, we will attempt to attach these promoters to our genes.</LI><LI>We conducted PCR on 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 dilutions of the ChlH Gibson assembly product with a number of different primers (BB-VF2/BB-VR, G1F/G6R and BBF/BBR) as a further test of the success or failure of the biobrick construction attempted on 9 July.</LI><LI>A second round of testing was conducted for the gene specific primers we had previously designed.</LI></UL></UL><H5>Tuesday 14 July</H5>
Screening of parts
<UL><LI>We ran a gel of the PCR products of the ChlH Gibson assembly mix dilutions from yesterday and a further PCR of the 1/1000 dilution with the primers G1F and G6R was set up to run overnight.</LI><LI>We conducted PCR of ChlM as a further measure to screen for successful ligation into a BioBrick vector. Alongside this we conducted colony PCR of the lac and T7 promoter transformants from yesterday and a further PCR of our ChlD BioBrick with a high GC enhancing buffer and Hot Start polymerase.</LI><LI>These PCR products were then run on a gel and, as seen below, all of the ChlM and ChlD samples amplified successfully and produced bands of the expected size. Further the transformation of the lac promoter appears to have been successful although the transformation of the T7 promoter was not.</LI><LI>Liquid cultures of lac promoter transformant cells were made.</LI></UL><H5>Wednesday 15 July</H5>
Screening of parts
<UL><LI>Plasmid prep of lac promoter liquid culture that had been incubating overnight, followed by enzymatic digest (double digest with EcoRI and SpeI; double digest with SpeI and PstI) followed by gel electrophoresis (PCR product of ChlH also ran).</LI><LI>As seen in the image below, it appears that the Gibson assembly attempted on 9 July was unsuccessful. However the band sizes produced by the restriction digest of the lac plasmids is suggestive of a successful transformation. (Note: lane 1 contains ChlH PCR product and lanes 3 and 4 contain digested lac plasmid.)</LI></UL>

Screening of parts
<UL><LI>We conducted a further PCR of  our ChlH Gibson Assembly mix from July 9 using the following primer pairs;</LI><UL><LI>BBVF2 and BBVR</LI><LI>BBVF2 and G6R</LI><LI>G1F and G6R</LI><LI>G1F and BBVR</LI></UL><LI>We conducted plasmid preps of yesterdayâ€™s liquid cultures, and, after determining their concentrations via nanodrop, these plasmids were again subject to restriction digests, this time with XbaI and PstI. These digests were then run on a gel for screening using the PCR products of the genes in question (CTH1+YCF54, GUN4, Chli1, ChlM and ChlD) as a control. Again, the results indicated an unsuccessful composite part construction.</LI><LI>We then attempted to construct these lac promoter composite parts using a modified Biobrick assembly protocol seen below.</LI><UL><LI>~500ng of the upstream part plasmid, in this case the lac promoter, was digested withEcoRI and SpeI.</LI><LI>~100ng of the downstream part plasmid, in this case one of the following genes; CTH1+YCF54, GUN4, Chli1, ChlM or ChlD, was digested with XbaI and PstI.</LI><LI>~100ng of the destination plasmid, in this case the psb1A3 linear vector, was digested with EcoRI and PstI.</LI><LI>All three parts were then ligated and transformed into competent cell before being plated out onto Amp media.</LI></UL></UL><H5>Wednesday 22 July</H5>
Of the biobrick construction plates from last night, only the lac+CTH1+YCF54 and the lac+ChlM transformants produced colonies. We made liquid cultures of these colonies and resuspended the lac+Chli1, lac+ChlD and lac+GUN4 cells in LB-Amp media to test for growth.<UL><LI>Growth was observed for these cultures and they were subsequently plated onto Amp media.</LI><LI>We conducted colony PCR of lac+CTH1+YCF54 and lac+ChlM transformants with both the gene specific primers we had designed and the biobrick primers. These PCR products were then run on gel for screening purposes.</LI><LI>We re-attempted the ligation of the lac+Chli1, lac+ChlD and lac+GUN4 biobrick assemblies at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C (it had previously been done at room temperature), transformed the ligation products into competent cells and plated them onto AMP media.</LI><LI>We induced expression in our Chli1+ChlD+GUN4, POR+DVR1+ChlP+ChlG and POR+DVR1+ChlP transformed cells using IPTG and ran a protein gel to test for expression. Uninduced cultures were used as a point reference to see if our genes were being correctly expressed.</LI></UL><H5>Thursday 23 July</H5>
Screening of products
<UL><LI>We made liquid cultures of the lac+Chli1, lac+ChlD and lac+GUN4 colonies that had been plated out yesterday.</LI><LI>We conducted colony PCR of the lac + Chli1, lac + ChlD and lac + GUN4 cultures using both the gene specific primers we designed and the biobrick primers.

Backbone switch for ChlH from KAN to CAM<UL><LI>500 ng of ChlH was digested in a tube with 25ng of psb1C3 with EcoRI and PstI. Ligase was then added and the ligation products were transformed into competent cells. The cells were then plated out onto LB-CAM media.</LI></UL>
Functional assay for lac + ChlM<UL><LI>Cells were harvested from eight 50 ml overnight cultures, four of which had been induced IPTG,  the other four were auto-induced. An assay was undertaken to test for the conversion of Mg-protoporphyrin IX to Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester, separating the products using high performance liquid chromatography. None of our cultures showed evidence of Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester production when introduced to the appropriate substrates (Mg-protoporphyrin IX and S-adenosyl methionine). It is likely that the E. coli strain used for the assay was not ideal for expression under the lac promoter.</LI></UL><H5>Tuesday 15 September</H5><UL><LI>The backbone switch of ChlH from KAN to CAM was attempted again, as it failed yesterday.</LI><LI>PCR was conducted for ChlM, lac + ChlM and transformed DH5 alpha cells to determine; (a) that the lac promoter was definitely present in the composite parts we were using and (b) whether or not these cells were indeed transformants. Once the PCR products had been run on a gel it was clear that the lac promoter was present but the DH5 alpha cells had not been successfully transformed.</LI><LI>We ran a â€˜show gelâ€™ of all the successfully constructed parts from the chlorophyll synthesis pathway to include in our results section (Image 29).</LI></UL>
IMAGE 29<UL><LI>We conducted PCR with primers for ChlH to check that the part had been assembled in the correct order.</LI><LI>lac + ChlM transformed DH5 alpha cells were induced and set up to incubate whilst shaking overnight for a second attempt at a functional assay for ChlM to be conducted tomorrow.</LI><LI>Further, XL Blue and K12 E.coli cells were made competent and transformed with our lac + ChlM plasmids and plated out. These will be used for a third attempt for the assay if the second also fails.</LI></UL><H5>Wednesday 16 September</H5><UL><LI>The composite parts lac + DVR1, lac + GUN4 and lac + Plasto were transformed into K12 and XL Blue E. coli cells. These cells were later induced in preparation for a protein gel to check for expression.</LI><LI>A gel of the primer tests for ChlH was run and it was clear that too much DNA had been loaded. The PCR was repeated with a diluted ChlH template and these products were run on another gel. However, no products were seen on the gel.</LI><LI>The functional assay for ChlM was repeated with induced DH5-alpha cells that had been transformed with our lac + ChlM plasmids. There was clear evidence that Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester was produced.</LI></UL>

Image 30:<I> HPLC. From the graph above, we were able to calculate the amount of this precursor molecule that had been converted by ChlM. In this instance, 26% of the precursor molecule had been converted by the enzyme ChlM. The ChlM pET expression successfully converted 12% of the precursor molecule, it becomes quite apparent that our protein expression was very successful.</I><H5>Thursday 17 September</H5><UL><LI>XL Blue and K12 E. coli cultures containing the plasmids lac + GUN4, lac + DVR1 and lac + Plasto and lac + ChlM were induced. Samples were then lysed and run on a protein gel. Clear bands were observed for GUN4, Plasto and ChlM and these bands were cut from the gel for trypsin digest in preparation for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry tomorrow.</LI><LI>A gel of all 13 chlorophyll a synthesis pathway genes was run.</LI><LI>Further functional assays were performed for ChlM, this time with K12 and XL Blue cells. Only low level enzymatic activity was observed.</LI></UL>
