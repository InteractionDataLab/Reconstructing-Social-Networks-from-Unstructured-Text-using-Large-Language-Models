Project Description
 
Our project has its focus on photosynthesis - the natural process where plants and algae convert sunlight into usable energy. By developing artificial photosynthesis in a biological system we can better harvest the unlimited supply of solar energy. The long-term goal is to engineer bacteria that can produce hydrogen gas on an industrial scale.
