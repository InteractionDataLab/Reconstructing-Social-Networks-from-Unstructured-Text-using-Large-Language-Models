Experiments and Protocol
Making Competent Cells
Using a sterile plastic loop, pick 10-12 large (2-3mm in diameter) colonies from the plate. Inoculate to 150mL of SOB medium in a 1L flask, and grow overnight at 18-22oC, 200-250rpm.
A600 should be 0.2-0.8 to harvest. Preferably, cells should be in mid log phase with A600 ~ 0.5.
Remove the flask from the incubator and place on ice for 10 minutes.
Transfer the culture to a 15mL centrifuge tube and spin at 2500 x g for 10 min at 4oC
Pour off and discard the supernatant, and immediately place the tube on ice.
Resuspend your cells in 1mL of ice-cold TB buffer, make sure there are no clumps of cells left, but also treat your cells gently and keep them cold.
Add ice-cold TB buffer to bring volume up to 1/5th of the original culture volume (~30mL in this case). Mix the tube by gently inverting 3 times.
Incubate the tube on ice for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 7 minutes at 4oC, discard the supernatant.
Gently resuspend the cells in ~1/20th of the original culture volume of ice-cold TB buffer. NOTE: 1/20th is based on and OD600 of 0.5, so adjust volume accordingly. e.g. if the culture OD600 was 0.1 then resuspend in 1/100th of original volume.
Pre-chill 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes on ice. Add 930µl of your cell suspension, keeping the remainder on ice in the 15mL tube.
Add 70µl of DMSO to the 930µl of cell suspension. Mix gently by swirling, and place on ice.
Aliquot 100µl of the competent cell/DMSO mixture into fresh microcentrifuge tubes. Label the tubes with: Date – Strain. Snap freeze with liquid nitrogen.
Repeat step 11-13 for the rest of your cell suspension in step 10. Store cells at -80oC

Composite Part Ligation
The assembly of composite parts from two existing BioBricks i.e. BioBrick plasmid A (parent vector) and BioBrick plasmid B (gene to be inserted) was performed through a restriction digest/ligation protocol.
