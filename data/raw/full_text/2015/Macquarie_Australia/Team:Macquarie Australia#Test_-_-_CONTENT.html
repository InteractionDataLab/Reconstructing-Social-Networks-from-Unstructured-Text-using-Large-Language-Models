By engineering the biosynthetic pathway for chlorophyll-a, we are taking the first step towards developing the entire photosystem II in the hope of generating hydrogen gas. The industrial potential lies in the ability of channelling this hydrogen gas to develop a renewable energy source. The project aims to engineer the essential genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a into E. coli.</P></ARTICLE><ASIDE><H1>About our hero</H1><P>Let me introduce myself: My name's Zozor.
