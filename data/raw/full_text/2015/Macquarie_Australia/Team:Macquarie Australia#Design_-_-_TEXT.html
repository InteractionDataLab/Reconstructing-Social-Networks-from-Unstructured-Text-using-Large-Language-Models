Project Design
Design
There are three main components in our project design this year:
Chlorophyll Biosynthesis Pathway
By adding 4 operons the protoporphyrin-IX molecule that E. coli uses to make heme can be transformed with enzymes to make the chlorophyll-a molecule.
Photosystem II
Through the expression of 5 operons we aim to induce E. coli to build the Photosystem II protein complex which contains the Oxygen Evolving Centre of photosynthesis.
Hydrogenase
A hydrogenase enzyme can take two protons and two electrons to build H2 (molecular hydrogen).
