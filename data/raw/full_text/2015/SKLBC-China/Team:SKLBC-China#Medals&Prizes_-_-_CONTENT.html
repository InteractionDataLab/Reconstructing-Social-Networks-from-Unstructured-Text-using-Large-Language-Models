The purpose of 1kg Bio-Box is to facilitate self-learning in synthetic biology among teenagers and spread basic concepts of synthetic biology to the public. In the future, we are convinced that synthetic biology will be a crucial field in scientific research as well as the advancement of mankind. What we found effetive to cultivate , is by creating an educational tool kit that of this tool kit. Through the usage of 1kg Bio-Box, students establish fundamental understandings of this subject and obtain necessary inspiration at the beginning of their study in synthetic biology, while us instructors can reflect on the essence of science and take up the social responsibility. </B><B>.</B></P><P style="font-size:22px">√ Help an iGEM team from another school or institution to meet a specific experimental or modeling goal by, for example, characterizing their part, debugging their construct, or modeling or simulating their system.</P><P><B>Our project Weigem 2.0 has helped SYSU-China, TJU and SCUT-China with seeking and sharing their biobricks.</B></P>.
