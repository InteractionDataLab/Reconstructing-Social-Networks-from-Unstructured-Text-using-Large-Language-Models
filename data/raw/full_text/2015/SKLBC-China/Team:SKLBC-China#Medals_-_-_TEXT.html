√ Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Our team has been registered, we have had the best summer, and we sure plan to have lots of fun at the Giant Jamboree!
√ Complete the Judging form and all required consent forms.
Our Judging form (https://igem.org/2015_Judging_Form?id=1793) was completed the 17th of September.
√ Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We sure did, you are currently on it.
√Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
We are looking forward and planning to attend the Gigant Jamboree in Boston, where we will present our project with a talk and a poster.
√ Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
In the section: Attributions we describe all the help we have received and in the section; Process we describe how we divided the main responsibilities between us, team members.
√ Collaborate with another team or become a mentee for any iGEM team that has previously participated in the iGEM competition and is attending the 2015 Jamboree.
As described in Collaboration , we are a mentee of TJU, SYSU-China and SCUT-China.
Silver
√ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
We have designed and documented one new basic part BioBricks BBa_K1793010 .
√ Document the characterization of an existing part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry. This part can come from the 2015 Distribution, or you can order a part from the Registry.
We characterize the size of our BioBrick and the documentation has been uploaded to Registry of Standard Biological Parts and is also available in our section Part

√ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
Our major question is to help students understand synthetic biology in an easier way. To approach this, we have made questionnaires, an innovation teaching tool, a wide outreach including online and offline. For more details, visit our section: Practices .
Gold
√ Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the Human Practices Hub for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
1 kg Bio-Box, an innovative educational tool kit that is highly reusable and combines the learning process of synthetic biology with multiplayer games and studying aids, allowing kids to learn with fun and proceed the learning process unconsciously under systematic guidance, is developed in the cooperation with AiJu, a famous social enterprise in China focusing on extending creative education in schools in China. The purpose of 1kg Bio-Box is to facilitate self-learning in synthetic biology among teenagers and spread basic concepts of synthetic biology to the public. In the future, we are convinced that synthetic biology will be a crucial field in scientific research as well as the advancement of mankind. What we found effetive to cultivate , is by creating an educational tool kit that of this tool kit. Through the usage of 1kg Bio-Box, students establish fundamental understandings of this subject and obtain necessary inspiration at the beginning of their study in synthetic biology, while us instructors can reflect on the essence of science and take up the social responsibility. .
√ Help an iGEM team from another school or institution to meet a specific experimental or modeling goal by, for example, characterizing their part, debugging their construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Our project Weigem 2.0 has helped SYSU-China, TJU and SCUT-China with seeking and sharing their biobricks.
.
√ Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember, biological materials may not be taken outside the lab.)
Our project WEiGEM 2.0 derive from the BEST SOFTWARE TOOL in iGEM 2014 HS, in this year we update it and WEiGEM 2.0 is more functional and available as a web-app on mobile phone. Visit us by following our official acount on WeChat.
Prize
Best Education and Public Engagement
We develop an innovative educational tool kit that aims at inspire the imagination and curiosity of synthetic biology among teenagers in China, especially for those who live under poor education condition or high study stress. It is a highly reusable product that can be brought to every school in China in extreme convenience by other activity organizers and iGEMers, due to its small size and the hard structure. Through the usage of 1kg Bio-Box, the distance between ordinary students and synthetic biology gets closer, and iGEMers participating in this activity establish a stronger connection with their communities. It enables exchanges in ideas and bidirectional influences among participants and organizers. Additionally, our cooporation with AiJu, a famous social enterprise in China that has connections with over six hundred schools in China, makes the potential impact of 1kg Bio-Box is huge, and profound.
Best Software Tool
WEiGEM2.0 includes various functions to fulfill the demands from wet teams. It integrates information from numerous sources in one platform, helping starters to begin their projects quickly and efficiently. It use the most up-to-date biobricks data, providing a convenient search tool for iGEMers. Moreover, it optimizes the search mode and can automatically add prefix and suffix in every sequence of biobricks in the searching results, based on different users' needs. With articles and researches about synthetic biology pushing from time to time, it give access to the latest news in synthetic biology. According to feedbacks from various wet teams, our tool is rather useful and easy to operate, because they can use it in their cell phones wherever they are and review their marked biobricks whenever they need in laboratory works. And the user experience is terrific since users can get the hang of this tool in a few minutes.
