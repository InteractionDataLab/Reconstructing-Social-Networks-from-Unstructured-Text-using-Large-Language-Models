OUR PART
As high school team with the BEST SOFTWARE TOOL prize in iGEM 2014 HS, our team continues to focus on developing software to help iGEMers carry on their experiments and focuses more on software.
In order to experience synthetic biology, and further promote the impact of iGEM to our schools and Southern China, this summer, we took the experiment to design a new standard BioBrick Part and characterization of an existing part under the instruction of staff from SKLBC.
During the process, we realized that dry-lab and wet-lab could work close together, to bridge the information gap between science and citizens with educational events.
New Basic Part: BBa_K1793010
miR-397, a miRNA in rice. Rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition, especially in Aisa, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. miR-397 can increase grain yield by downregulating its target, OsLAC, whose product is a laccase-like protein that we found to be involved in the sensitivity of plants to brassinosteroids. miR397 is a plant miRNA and have not target in human. It is safe and may be useful for synthic biology to increase grain yield not only in rice but also in other cereal crops.

Safety
miR397 is a plant miRNA and have not target in human. It is safe and may be useful for synthic biology to increase grain yield not only in rice but also in other cereal crops.
Source
miR-379 is a miRNA in rice. And we got it from the State Key Laboraroty of Bio-Control (SKLBC).
Characterization of an Existing Part: BBa_K1218011
We have PCR the CAS9 gene and learn the PCR technology
