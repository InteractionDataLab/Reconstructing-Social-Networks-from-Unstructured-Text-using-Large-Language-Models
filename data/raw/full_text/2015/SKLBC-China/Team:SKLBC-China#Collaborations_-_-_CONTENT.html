Eventually, considering the limited chemistry and biology knowledge of our potensial user, we put our focus on biobricks, the base and one of the key concepts of synthetic biology, which is comparitively easy to understand and can also provide a peek of synthetic biology. Afterwards, we began to draw the outline of the box's design and divided our team into two groups, one focusing on the hardware part of the box while the other designing the contexts, games, and rules. The next time we met with AiJu aimed at improving the draft of the box from the perspective of professional education tool kit developers. We learnt a lot from the suggestion from AiJu about the essence of innovative education and how to make your product understandable by comics, figures, analogies and so on.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="design"><H3>MEETUP IN GUANGZHOU</H3><DIV class="services-bottom"><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="height:320px"><P>The first meetup among undergraduate teams and high school teams includes <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SYSU-China">SYSU_CHINA</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software">SYSU_SOFTWARE</A>, <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SCUT-China">SCUT_CHINA</A>, and <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software">SCUT_SOFTWARE</A> from Sun Yat-Sen University and South China University of Science and Techonology, and SKLBC_CHINA and SKLBC_GDSYZX from various high schools.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="height:320px"><P>At the beginning of the meetup, all the participants get to know each other by ice-breaking self introductions and form an initial impression on each team's projects.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="height:320px"><P>The second part of the meetup consist of presentations of projects from all the participating teams. During the presentation, all the teams showed great passion and commitment in their projects. Particularly, our team not only learnt a lot more about advanced technology but got a lot of inspiration from other projects as well.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="height:320px"><P>After presentation, all the participants are divided into groups to held a world cafe section on the relationship of software, experiment. We echanged ideas and opinions on this issue with undergraduate students. It was an inspiring and insightful discussion that provides us an extended vision to analyze this multi-dimensional problem.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="height:320px"><P>After the meetup, we kept close contacts with other teams and shared project updates or experience throughout the preparation for iGEM. The collegiate teams provided valuable resources for our projects and practical advice on the development of WEiGEM2.0.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="design"><H3>CONFERENCE OF CHINA iGEMER'S COMMITTEE</H3><DIV class="services-bottom"><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left"><P>The CCiC was held in Peking University from August 14th to 15th, hosted by School of Life Science in Peking University. It was wonderful opportunity for iGEMers in China to gather together and strengthen the bonds among Chinese iGEM community. The participants include 30 undergraduate teams and 2 high school teams. As one of the three high school participating teams in CCiC, it was an great chance for SKLBC_CHINA to practice for public presentation before the Giant Jamboree and learn more about synthetic biology through other teams' projects. In spite of the presentation, various lectures from ex-iGEMers gave us insprirations on the possible developments of synthetic biology in the future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="design"><H3>Collaborations With Other Teams</H3><DIV class="services-bottom"><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="width:100%"><P>This is our second year participating the iGEM competition, although we have acquired the Best Software in High School track last year, there are still a lot things that we haven’t done pretty well. Luckily, this year, we found help from TJU iGEM 2015. They initiate a Handbook program for assistance where other team can get access to the overall necessary information about the competition through such book. Particularly, several pieces of excellent work done by other teams are included in the Handbook, hence we are able to learn from the best projects and make ourselves better this year. Besides, we can get more acquainted with the knowledge of synthetic biology like how to obtain the target genes or how to extract plasmid. This helps us balance our shortcomings and advantages, and we hope that we can get a preferable result this year.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="width:100%"><P>At the beginning of August, we were invited by SCUT_CHINA to visit their laboratory and completed several experiments in their lab with their assistence, advancing our understanding of wet team's works and laboratory protocols.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6 services-left" style="width:100%"><P>In order to fulfill the demand of users of WEiGEM2.0, we further developed the syncing function of marked biobricks between PC and mobile phone by scanning QR codes along with <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:SKLBC-DGSYZX" style="color:blue">SKLBC_GDSYZX</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="footer-main"><DIV class="footer-bottom"><DIV class="col-md-4 footer-middle"><P>Copyright © 2015.SKLBC_CHINA All rights reserved.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 footer-right"><P><A href="#home" class="scroll">TO THE TOP</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
