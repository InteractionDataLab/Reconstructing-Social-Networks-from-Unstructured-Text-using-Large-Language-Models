miR397 is a plant miRNA and have not target in human. It is safe and may be useful for synthic biology to increase grain yield not only in rice but also in other cereal crops.
Source
miR-379 is a miRNA in rice. And we got it from the State Key Laboraroty of Bio-Control (SKLBC).
Risks
The experiment is only for the students enjoy the iGEM research-based learning. It is foundational and only used in lab with little effect on the real world.
Before conducting the experiment, we have received adequate training. And Yishun Zhang is responsible for the safety of biology labs.
Since miR-397 is only targeted to plants, they are safe for both human beings and domestic animals.                             The guidelines for laboratory biosafety: soeasy.sysu.edu.cn/dela/uploadfiles/201541093923332.doc
