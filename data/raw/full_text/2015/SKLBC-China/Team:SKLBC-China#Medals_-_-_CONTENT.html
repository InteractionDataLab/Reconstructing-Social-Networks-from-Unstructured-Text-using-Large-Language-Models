The purpose of 1kg Bio-Box is to facilitate self-learning in synthetic biology among teenagers and spread basic concepts of synthetic biology to the public. In the future, we are convinced that synthetic biology will be a crucial field in scientific research as well as the advancement of mankind. What we found effetive to cultivate , is by creating an educational tool kit that of this tool kit.

We develop an innovative educational tool kit that aims at inspire the imagination and curiosity of synthetic biology among teenagers in China, especially for those who live under poor education condition or high study stress. It is a highly reusable product that can be brought to every school in China in extreme convenience by other activity organizers and iGEMers, due to its small size and the hard structure. Through the usage of 1kg Bio-Box, the distance between ordinary students and synthetic biology gets closer, and iGEMers participating in this activity establish a stronger connection with their communities. It enables exchanges in ideas and bidirectional influences among participants and organizers. Additionally, our cooporation with AiJu, a famous social enterprise in China that has connections with over six hundred schools in China, makes the potential impact of 1kg Bio-Box is huge, and profound.

WEiGEM2.0 includes various functions to fulfill the demands from wet teams. It integrates information from numerous sources in one platform, helping starters to begin their projects quickly and efficiently. It use the most up-to-date biobricks data, providing a convenient search tool for iGEMers. Moreover, it optimizes the search mode and can automatically add prefix and suffix in every sequence of biobricks in the searching results, based on different users' needs. With articles and researches about synthetic biology pushing from time to time, it give access to the latest news in synthetic biology. According to feedbacks from various wet teams, our tool is rather useful and easy to operate, because they can use it in their cell phones wherever they are and review their marked biobricks whenever they need in laboratory works. And the user experience is terrific since users can get the hang of this tool in a few minutes.
