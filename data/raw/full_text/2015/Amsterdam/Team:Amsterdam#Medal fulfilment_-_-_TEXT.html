MEDAL FULFILMENT
Great summer? Check.
The overview
We didn't do it for the medal (but it would be nice to get one)
Bronze
Registered our team
Completed the judging form
Created a team wiki
Presented our poster and talk at the jamboree
Attributed everyone who helped us
Document and submitted new parts
Silver
Experimentally validated and documented another new biobrick
Submitted this new biobrick to the registry: check
Investigated social and sustainability implications of our project in techno-moral vignettes
Gold
Demonstrated extensive and innovative human practices efforts in our collaboration with Synenergene
Collaborated with TU delft to describe a novel application based on combining our projects in the form of a bio-composite leaf using 3D-printed biofilm-based consortia
Demonstrated a functional prototype of our project by co-culturing Synechocystis and E. coli strains together and detecting meso-butanediol produced via a three-step back-and-forth process.
