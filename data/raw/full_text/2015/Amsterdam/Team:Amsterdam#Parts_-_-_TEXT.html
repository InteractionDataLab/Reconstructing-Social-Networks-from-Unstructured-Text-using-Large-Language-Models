Submitted Parts
BBa_K1844001
AckA1 coding part
This part includes the coding region of the AckA1 gene from lactococcus lactis, which catalyzes acetate production from acetyl phosphate. Over-expression in Synechocystis leads to increased acetate production.
BBa_K1844002
Pta Coding Region
This part includes the coding region of the Phosphate acetyltransferase gene of Synechocystis, which catalyzes the reaction converting Acetyl CoA to acetyl-phosphate in the biomass formation pathway of Synechocystis. Overexpressing this gene has been shown to result in increased acetate production in Synechocystis PCC. 6803
