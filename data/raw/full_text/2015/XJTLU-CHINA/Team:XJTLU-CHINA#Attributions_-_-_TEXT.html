Synbio Tech
Synbio Tech is an innovator in the field of synthesis biology in China, having a wide range of cooperation with both international companies and universities. It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthesis biology. For now, by applying their unique self-established technical platform Syno® involving sound chip-based gene synthesis and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.
As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatus and reagents needed and directly gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuits’ construction. At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthesis biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments. Also during the collaborate this summer, they were active in supervising our experiments and giving valuable suggestions on experiment protocols and result analysis.
Snapgene
Snapgene offers update vision’s software to all iGem teams and this software helps a lot in gene sequence designing as the customer-friendly visualization and annotation function bring a more efficient teamwork.
Team
Instructor & Sponsor
Guoxia Han
As an instructor of XJTLU-CHINA iGEm team, Dr. Han did nothing on our project as we can instruct themselves. He believed we were able to perform well in their lab work and outside activities. Before this competition, he had told us how to work in a team and do scientific research. Particularly, we had learned critical thinking and diligence from him. Hence, this time, only thing he did for us was communicating with some authorities in university to obtain their support. He trusts we can face difficulties and solve problems.
Yacheng Guan
He helped us for constructing chromoprotein test’s plasmids and answered the questions about designing the plasmid and experiment.
Yunpeng Zhong
Yunpeng put forward the idea of modularize the parts in circuits for convenient test of uncertain parts. He also helped us evaluate the feasibility of our map design and gave us experiment room to do our project.
Dechang Xu
Dechang Xu joined us in early July 2015 as a project advisor. He have given valuable suggestions on mathematical modeling and kept reminding the team for the important criteria that IGEM awarding requires.
Team members
Chenghao Shen
Chenghao was in charge of major designs of promotional materials, including making posters, banners, videos and PPT etc., anything about propagating our project both in giant jamboree and human practice. In addition, he also modified photos and pictures to beautify our wiki.
Hao Wu
Hao participated in the research & design of the ribotherometers and the second phase of our experiments (from August to September). He devoted to constructing and transforming all our parts. He also helped to conduct human practice and design the questionnaires about our topic and safety.
Tiange Li
Tian’ge did plenty literature research on genetic regulatory parts and have gave valuable suggestions regarding the problems we meet in wet experiment.  She also participated in designing and testing part of Ribothermometers and recorded this part of experiment on our notebook in detail during July, 2015.
Wenbo Xu
Wenbo was in authority of circuits design. He collected ideas and suggestions from teammates and constructed the DNA frame of our biothermomap. Mathematical modeling of this project was conducted by him with Xinhao’s support. He also did the work of sponsors contacting, safety form submitting and parts registration.
Yakun Tang
Yakun participated in and conducted the lab work during June, July and August. She also managed financial affairs and was responsible for items purchasing such as team uniforms. She wrote chromoprotein testing part that we put on our wiki and did human practice, such as participating iGEM meet up in Shanghai Science and Technology
Yizhou Wang
Yizhou participated in the first phase of our experiments (from June to August) and helped in reviewing literature on regulator parts that used in our project. He also contributed in writing the wiki part of ribothermometers, tet operator and so on. He did part of the work of human practices also i.g. The meetup in the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum
Zhe Yang
Zhe was responsible for monitoring the work of team in multiple aspects including experiment operating, human practices conducting, wiki designing, and so on. She participated in the lab work throughout this summer (From June to September) and was involved in designing the experiments for determining the degradation rate of chromoproteins and the validity of RNA thermometers (From June to September). She also contributed in notebook recording and result analysis.
Yinsiyi Wang
She is photographer and associated art designer in XJTLU-CHIAN. She took pictures and video in every event in human practice. She helped wiki editor to decorate our website and supported video editor to make microfilms for showing iGEM.
Tianhua Zhai
In April, he joined in a team held by several year 2 students who were curious about iGEM competition and then help to establish their iGEM team, the XJTLU-CHINA. In May, in an iGEM public speech he talked about a project about synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. The team achieved permit and funding from university after the speech. In June, he always participated in discussion and wrote a iGEM procedure in order to achieve further funding from a synbio company. In summer, he supported lab work. He had communication with other iGEM teams in shanghai workshop and organized many human practice events.
Jiongjian Li
Jiongjian designed the second version of our RNA thermometers and tested them, improved the function of our first version of RNA thermometers. He also participated in the molecular cloning experiments in August and September.
Xinhao Wang
Xinhao conducted the first and third round of RNA thermometer experiments. She also participated in molecular cloning experiments in July and September.
Gandi Yao
Gandi responsible for produceing the pictures put on wiki. Such as icons and sketch maps. He is also responsible for the uniform designing, the pictures of the poster.
Ziang Shi
Ziang is responsible for constructing wiki webpages as programmer. He also worked as wiki webpages art design with the help of Gandi.
Zixu Wang
Zixu designed the original pathway of our project together with Gandi. He also designed and operated the experiment of the "constitutive promoter + tet operator "system. Moreover, he took part in the meet up at Shanghai Science and Technology Museum. Meanwhile, he did some lab work and wrote something that we put on our wiki.
Yuwei Han
She helped doing the lab work, mainly in the experiments of picking and testing the function ribothermometer during July and August. She also participated in the molecular cloning experiment during that time.
