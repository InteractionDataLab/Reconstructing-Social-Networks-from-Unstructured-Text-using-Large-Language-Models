Collaboration with NYU-Shanghai
We provided plasmids synthesized by ourselves, E coli and IPTG for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. The two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transport. They want to use arabinose to stimulate transcription but with no color, we suggested that use different concentration of arabinose might find the best concentration to show the color. Because they use arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG should be the better choice. At that time, we use IPTG inducible plasmid PET21a respectively with blue chromoprotein and yellow chromoprotein in BL21 (DE3), both of them showing the color. Therefore, three week ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot, and we were also proud of supporting other groups in 2015 iGEM competition.
