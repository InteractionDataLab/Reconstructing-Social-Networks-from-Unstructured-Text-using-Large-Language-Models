Synthetic biology was explained as the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems and the re-design of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes. The engineering perspective of synthetic biology interested students from other department. She also talked about iGEM, the main process during the competition, and modern biological technologies used in iGEM. This was the first time staffs in biology department are introduced to iGEM and its importance.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="hPImgStyle2Text1"><P style="color: #FFFFFF">Figure 2. iGEM logo used during the presentation</P></DIV><DIV class="hPImgStyle2Text2"><P style="color: #FFFFFF">Figure 3. 2015 iGEM team map</P></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>Next in the public speech was the introduction of several projects in the previous iGEM competition.

We revealed two projects, which came out after long time discussion and brainstorm. One is a novel protein expression system with circular mRNA and RNA thermometer. Another is the synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. Professor Lv asked many questions about circular mRNA. He thought it could be used as drug to regulate gene expression; however he doubted that whether it could be used for the translation of proteins. Hence, James explained the mechanism of group I intron self-splicing RNA and results from literatures. Pro. Lv agreed and would like to help us with the project. Dr. Liu thought RNA thermometer was quite interesting and could be widely used. She hoped we could use RNA thermometer to create a fantastic project. Although the projects were replaced by another better idea, we still gained a lot from group discussions and research training.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="hPImgStyle2Text1"><P style="color: #FFFFFF">Figure 5.

The project involves the use of various colored E. coli to draw a world map; they in turn could change their color with an increase in temperature. Therefore, the color of world map will be changed as well, which could mimic the process of global warming. The poster also illustrated two creative ideas; one was using RNA thermometers controlling the translation of chrome-proteins, another was the constructing of genetic circuit which made protein expression ordered. We displayed the poster and introduced the project to other iGEM teams. They in turn, also gave us many useful suggestions on completing our project and improving parts quality.</P></DIV><DIV class="lv3"><P>This participant from USTC said: “First, I consider that your ideas are amazing! You can stimulate the process of global warming by culturing bacteria on medium. That is so creative. Furthermore, although you are just doing art design, your team has too much work to realize it. In all, your project this year is excellent！I can give you a little advice. Your project could closely stimulate the global climate. Why not go and achieve the up-date data of global climate? Therefore, you can control the temperature to display more detail information. If so, your bacterial map will be closer to the real world.”</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="hPImgStyle3Text"><P style="color: #FFFFFF">Figure 5: Communicating with a gentleman from the USTC team</P></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>A lady from China-Tongji said: “It is a great idea to let the bacteria change their color automatically in order to stimulate the process of global warming.

China-Tongji iGEM team tried to make nematodes light-sensitive, which we thought was an amazing project. Although scientists had created light-sensitive mice, challenge remains expression of light-sensitive proteins. We also pointed out issues with ethics and safety for China-Tongji. 

ZJU-China team made a funny biological playing card; this board game could help student learn much about synthetic biology. We advised them to make the board game easier to understand and design it with information that is more detailed so that public could accept it rather than biology students only. 

NYU-Shanghai did a fantastic project; their work not only limited to synthetic biology but also involved applying knowledge and technologies from multiple subjects including electrical engineering, computer science and VR. We learned a lot from what they did on expanding human practices and thus designed LEGO project to show our genetic circuit and RNA thermometer. We wish this attempt would make our project to be easier to be understood by general public. Furthermore, we started to cooperate with them after the workshop. We provided several biobricks for them as support to finish their project.

This task aimed to let more people in different fields to synthetic biology and iGEM. 

We paid much effort to human practices. During the workshop, we explained thorough detail of our project to many visitors including a museum staff who presented all projects on the museum website for online visitors. Many of the attendees have no background in biology, thereby we used the simplest way to introduce synthetic biology and show our project. Additionally, we gave an academic presentation to an expert from Fudan University. He was very drawn to the ribosome meter and predicted that this technology would have a huge application. During workshop, we were surprised to find that a little child was able to participate in the NYU-Shanghai exhibition. Giving education to next generation may be the best way to resolve the issue of global warming.

This question is aimed to find whether synthetic biology is well-known in China or not and let more people know about this field. According to this result, only a quarter of people heard about bio-synthesis before our survey. Over a half of people did not know about synthetic biology before. Also, 16 people were not sure that they had a clear idea about synthetic biology. We considered that most of people did not have biological background. Furthermore, industries that are working on bio-synthesis have just been developed recently in China so it is not popular right now. Therefore, we should provide some associated information for public. If people chose ‘B’ and ‘C’, the definition of synthetic biology would be displayed. Additionally, we found that they were also willing to search synthetic biology on internet and wanted to learn more about this novel field&gt;
                    </P><P>Provided definition: Synthetic biology is the design and construction of biological devices and systems for useful purposes. It is an area of biological research and technology that combines biology and engineering, thus often overlapping with bioengineering and biomedical engineering. It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a focus on engineering biology and biotechnology.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 2Which conventional industries will be replaced by synthetic biology? 你认为以下哪些传统产业会被合成生物学取代?</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>As we known, synthetic biology can be applied in many area and even replace some conventional industries. We asked Dr. Liu, a biologist in our university, for which area could be replaced by bio-synthesis. She made a list including agriculture, metallurgic industry, cottonocracy and oil industry. Hence, we asked people this question to find if they knew the application of synthetic biology. Result was that most of people considered that conventional industries such as agriculture, cottonocracy and oil industry may be replaced by bio-synthesis. Particularly, the majority of people chose oil because they know biofuels are being used. However, only a few people knew that synthetic biology could be applied in metallurgic industries as well.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 3Have you ever heard about bio-safety before? 您在这份调查之前是否听说过生物安全？</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>Biosafety is an important issue in biological research as well as in human society. We wanted to find out if people knew about bio-safety and we hoped that they could pay attention to bio-safety after this survey. Result was that less than a half of people have heard about bio-safety before and over a half of people did not consider about safe problem. Therefore, we provided some information about biosafety after they answered this question; they could learn and start to think about bio-safe problem. </P><P>Provided information: Biosafety is the prevention of large-scale loss of biological integrity, focusing both on ecology and human health. These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect us from harmful incidents. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 4Some people consider that modern biotechnologies including synthetic biotechnology may cause problem in safety of human society. do you agree or disagree? 有人认为现代生物技术包括合成生物学技术会对人类社会安全带来严重问题。你是否同意这个观点？</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>Modern biotechnologies have developed of human society in many ways, for example clinical treatment, biofuels and GMOs. Nonetheless, some people worrys that biotechnologies may cause ethic or safe problem in human society. Hence, we ask people this question to find their opinions about biotechnologies. Result was that 32.5% of people agreed that synthetic biotechnology may cause safe problems. While, 28.75% of people considered it was absolutely safe. However, over one third people were not sure that if it had positive effect or negative effect. We thought that many people in China did not accept biotechnology, they worry that it would be harmful to their heath. We should do more work to ensure the safety of biotechnology so that more people will trust it. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 5What do you think is the current situation of global climate?你觉得目前全球气候的状况是怎样的？</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>We wanted to find Chinese people’ views on climate change.

They argued that biology students may have operation mistakes so that these bacteria could separate into environment and cause danger. We explained that we had a serious trainning to prevent any mistake during experiments. Furthermore, any biomaterial in lab must be treated before it enters the environment.</P><P>GMOs are popular in US, they usually have better properties. However, more and more people concern about the safety of genetically modified food, though some authentic organization such as FDA or WHO announced GM foods are absolutely safe. We wanted to find Chinese people’s views on GM foods, thus we ask them question 5, 6, 7 and 8.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 10Which foods do you think are genetically modified?

Results were that the majority of people know the soybean was GMO as well as anti-virus pimento. While, less than half of people considered that cherry tomato, which means many people still did not it is genetically modified. Particularly, only a few people thought the potato with smooth surface as GMO, but most of people did not know. In conclusion, we thought Chinese people could distinguish some common GMOs, however some they could not. Therefore, more information about genetically modified foods should be provided to public. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 11Have you bought and eaten genetically modified food? 你曾经购买并食用过转基因食品吗？</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><P>We found that about 44% of people had bought and eaten the GM foods while only 4 people clearly knew that they never bought or ate any GM foods. We were surprised found that over a half of people were not sure they ate GM foods. Reasons for that is GM foods were not obviously labeled in China or they usually ignore the label.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><H3>Question 12Why did you chose them?
