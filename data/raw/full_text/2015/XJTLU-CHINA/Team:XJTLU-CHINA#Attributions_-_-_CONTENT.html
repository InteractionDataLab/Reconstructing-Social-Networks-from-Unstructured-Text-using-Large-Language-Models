It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthesis biology. For now, by applying their unique self-established technical platform Syno® involving sound chip-based gene synthesis and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.</P><P>As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatus and reagents needed and directly gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuits’ construction. At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthesis biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments. Also during the collaborate this summer, they were active in supervising our experiments and giving valuable suggestions on experiment protocols and result analysis.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><H4>Snapgene</H4><P>Snapgene offers update vision’s software to all iGem teams and this software helps a lot in gene sequence designing as the customer-friendly visualization and annotation function bring a more efficient teamwork. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv2"><P>Team</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="lv1"><DIV class="lv3"><H4>Instructor &amp; Sponsor</H4><P>Guoxia Han</P><P>As an instructor of XJTLU-CHINA iGEm team, Dr. Han did nothing on our project as we can instruct themselves. He believed we were able to perform well in their lab work and outside activities. Before this competition, he had told us how to work in a team and do scientific research. Particularly, we had learned critical thinking and diligence from him. Hence, this time, only thing he did for us was communicating with some authorities in university to obtain their support. He trusts we can face difficulties and solve problems.</P><P>Yacheng Guan</P><P>He helped us for constructing chromoprotein test’s plasmids and answered the questions about designing the plasmid and experiment.</P><P>Yunpeng Zhong</P><P>Yunpeng put forward the idea of modularize the parts in circuits for convenient test of uncertain parts.

In May, in an iGEM public speech he talked about a project about synthesis of crispr-cas system in gliomas cell to specifically knock out CD44 gene for inhibiting cell migration and activation. The team achieved permit and funding from university after the speech. In June, he always participated in discussion and wrote a iGEM procedure in order to achieve further funding from a synbio company. In summer, he supported lab work. He had communication with other iGEM teams in shanghai workshop and organized many human practice events. </P><P>Jiongjian Li</P><P>Jiongjian designed the second version of our RNA thermometers and tested them, improved the function of our first version of RNA thermometers.
