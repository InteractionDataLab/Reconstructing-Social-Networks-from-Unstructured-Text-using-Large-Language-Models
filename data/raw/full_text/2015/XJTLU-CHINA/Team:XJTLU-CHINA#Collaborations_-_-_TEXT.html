Collaboration with NYU-Shanghai
We provided E. coli strains, IPTG and plasmids for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. two kinds of functional plasmids were synthesized by us. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein, noted for BBa _K1033910. The other was that of Aeblue chromoprotein, noted for BBa_K864401. We also supplied 5ml of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them IPTG as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during the transport. They wanted to use arabinose to induce transcription but no colors showed up, we suggested them that use different concentration of arabinose to find the best concentration to show the color. Because they used arabinose to stimulate transcription, we suggested that IPTG might be a better choice. At that time, we were using IPTG inducible plasmid pET21a respectively with blue chromoprotein and yellow chromoprotein in BL21 (DE3), and both of them showed the color. Therefore, three weeks ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot, and we were also proud of supporting other groups in 2015 iGEM competition.

Collaboration with Synbio-tech
Synbio Tech is an innovator in the field of synthetic biology in China, having a wide range of cooperation with both international companies and universities. It aims to provide customers with a perfect technical platform of the synthetic biology. For now, by applying their unique self-established technical platform Syno? involving sound chip-based gene synthetic and high throughput gene sequencing service, it already develops the technology of constructing recombinant antibody libraries as well as highly-purified vaccines, genome synthesis and DNA storage.
As a major sponsor of XJTLU-China 2015, they provided a lab equipped with all apparatus and reagents needed and directly gave a hand in the de novo gene synthesis in the circuitsâ€™ construction. At the beginning of iGEM project, the company offered us a training program including both theoretical basis of synthetic biology and practical skills useful in later wet experiments. Also during the collaboration this summer, they were active in supervising our experiments and giving valuable suggestions on experiment protocols and result analysis.
Guidance from BIT-China
We express our sincere gratitude for the contribution of the iGEM team BIT-China. They provided us a biobrick design: BBa_K1824000 after knowing the difficulties of our project and the biobrick was synthesized by us. This biobrick is a RNA thermometer that induces a translational activation at 42 celsius degree which is a vital part in performing color changing process in our project.
