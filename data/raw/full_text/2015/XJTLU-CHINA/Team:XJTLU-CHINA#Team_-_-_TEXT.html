Refer to biosafety, people realize its significant and are more concerned about safety issues. In addition, people worry about climate change and genetically modified foods. We guided them to have a green life and always eat healthy food.
Gold
Requirement 1: Human practice expanding
First, during iGEM workshop in Shanghai ST-museum, we displayed our project as well as synthetic biology to the public. We tried to explain our idea to people without any biology background; thereby we achieved much experience of educating public, and people get knowledge and happiness from us. In addition, we used LEGO robot to mimic protein translation for presenting project. It is a creative way, by using LEGO robot, to introduce synbio and educate the public. LEGO robot is popular all over the world; people accept and like to play it. Therefore, while we using our LEGO robot to present protein translation to public, all of them can understand and feel interested in this bio-synthesis process. We tried to educate people, particularly children, with this funny method and allow more people participate in biology filed.
Requirement 2: Help other team
We provided plasmids, E. coli and Arabinose for NYU-Shanghai to support their experiment. We synthesized the two kinds of functional plasmids. One was the plasmid of FwYellow chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033910. Another was that of Aeblue chromoprotein BBa, noted for K1033902. We also supplied 5000uL of BL21 competent cell for them to create new type of E. coli. For inducing the expression of chromoproteins, we gave them Arabinose as inducer. All these biology materials were packaged hermetically and Victor Zhou sent them to teammates in NYU-Shanghai in person in order to prevent any separation during transportation. Three weeks ago, they used our donation and made more samples.  They thanked us a lot and we were also proud of supporting other groups in iGEM competition.
