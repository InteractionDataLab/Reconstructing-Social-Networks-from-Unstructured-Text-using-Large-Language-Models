Project Overview
Synthetic biology researches are based on standardized biological parts, and the scientists should explore various metabolism databases to design their own devices or circuits. However, it is hard for researchers to design a proper biochemical pathway due to a considerable amount of data available on the Internet. Korea U Seoul, therefore, developed a web application ‘Gil’, which means “path” or “road” in Korean. This software is a spin-off version of ‘ IPNN ’. A researcher can search which set of reactions or genes is required to conduct a successful experiment.
The software ‘Gil’ is a bio-pathfinder for synthetic biologists. Given only a reactant and a final product, a user can obtain possible paths using our program. For instance, if you want to break some agarose into pyruvate, the ‘Gil' will show you maximum 12 optimal paths composed of biologically proven reactions. In addition, the biological scoring system is another significant feather of this software. The ‘Gil’ is able to calculate the increase and decrease of the number of ATP, NADH, NADPH, and CO2, and provide the maximum three output paths, respectively. Also, the ‘Gil’ contains BioBrick part registry, E. Coli K-12 gene data, and the Gibbs free energy of each reaction. This information helps people find the most plausible de novo pathway just like Google Maps.
