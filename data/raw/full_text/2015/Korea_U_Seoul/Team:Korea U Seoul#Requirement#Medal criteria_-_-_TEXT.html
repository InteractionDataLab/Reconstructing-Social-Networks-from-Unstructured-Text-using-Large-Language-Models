1.Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
We have registered for iGEM and developed our project since January, 2015. Especially, during the summer vacation, our team members learned the knowledge about python, advanced biology and how to create web app with visualization function. Also, we learned how to work in a team with many interactions. You can see the details in our notebook page in wiki. We will present our project in Giant Jamboree.
2.Complete the Judging form.
We have completed the Judging Form.
3.Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts (if any) using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have described our team’s project on iGEM wiki and documented our team’s parts.
4.Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree. See the 2015 poster guidelines for more information.
We have prepared a fascinating poster for the iGEM Jamboree. If you have interest in our project, come and listen at the Giant Jamboree.
5.Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We have created attribution page that describes clear attribution of each aspect of our project. For more details, please visit attribution page.
6. Develop and make available, via the iGEM GitHub page, an open source software that supports Synthetic Biology based on Standard Parts or interacts with the Registry. (For questions about the iGEM Github page, contact software [at] igem [dot] org.)
You can access our software which is open source through GitHub. Our software supports Synthetic Biology with the biobrick of the enzyme gene sequences. More details, please visit our GitHub page.
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved the following 3 goals:
1.Provide a comprehensive, well-designed User Guide for your software and upload it to your wiki. Be creative! (An instructional video may work as well.)
Our team provides a User Guide in the form of both video and text with pictures. For more details, please visit our User Guide page.
2.Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than "only" a stand-alone app for end users.)
We provide necessary code and its description of our software that makes it functional by the API documentation. For more details, please visit our documentation page .
3. Demonstrate that you followed best practices in software development so that other developers can modify, use, and reuse your code. Provide more than one realistic test case. Examples of best practices are automated unit testing and documentation of test coverage, bug tracking facilities, and documentation of releases and changes between releases.
We followed best practices in software development,
- We developed helpful and friendly API and detailed documents for other developers.
- We used GitHub that consists of codes and parsed data.
- We checked whether there are errors in the codes.
- We developed our Web application with separating test web and user web for its stability.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, your team must convince the judges you have achieved at least two of the following goals:
1. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. We refer to these activities as Human Practices in iGEM.Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project. (See the Human Practices Hub for more information.)
Our team carried out a survey which estimates the awareness of synthetic biology and realized that, as students studying synthetic biology, we have social responsibility of spreading out it and giving dream of it to the younger – a kind of social justice.
At the first time, we started with the children who start to learn about basic science. Hoping that they will have a dream of becoming scientists, we tried to make them interested in biology with easy concept at Seoul Science Hall.
Then we tried to apply our software ‘Gil’ on actual experimental environment by having a seminar informing synthetic biology and our software to undergraduate students within school. This might inspired them to research their project easily and create more ideas.
Finally, we served as a mentor of project proceeded by high school team. We gave several keys to develop their project so that they can keep going as a pre-biologists.
For more details, please visit our human practice page .
2. Address a problem that you would like to co-develop with a wetlab team. This should be a collaboration where the wetlab team posts a problem they are having and your team addresses the issue by creating an online software solution.
None
3. Re-use and further develop a previous iGEM software project (or parts thereof) and demonstrate how future teams can continue this trend through good code documentation, use of open source materials and creation of great instructional materials.
We recognized that Team:Illinois-Tools (2009) had had a similar project that provided web of chemical compound. However, the limitation of Illinois-Tools is that the branches in web tangled too much so that the output graph was distorted. So our team developed our project focused on user centered relevance. So, our web app ‘Gil’ provides users the clear and intuitive information. For example, if the users search for the chemical reaction pathway from glucose to ethanol, we provide them several graphs that are the shortest ones linked with the KEGG Database.
4. Demonstrate your software at the iGEM Giant Jamboree in the software demo suite. You should show a functional prototype that teams can use in following years. (Contact software AT igem DOT org for information about the software demo suite.)
Our team provides functional prototype software with helpful API for user and developer. Also, we will demonstrate our software at the iGEM Giant Jamboree in the software demo suite.
