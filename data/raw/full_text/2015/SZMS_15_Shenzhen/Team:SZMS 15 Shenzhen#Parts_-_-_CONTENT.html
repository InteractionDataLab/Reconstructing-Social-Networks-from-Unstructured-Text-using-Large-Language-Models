EC 1.7.7.2 is able to catalyze the reactions:
Nitrite + H2O + oxidized ferredoxin ⇄ nitrate + reduced ferredoxin + 2H+
HNO2 + NH3 = N2↑+ 2H2O
Obviously as suggested above, the first reaction is a reversible one; the heat we need is actually from the second reaction since the first one is basically to convert nitrate provided by our special LB into nitrite. On the other hand, the warmth released by the first reaction is so little that it has nearly no effect on the result. Consequently, we make only the math models for the second reaction, whose substrate is nitrate. As calculated, the general warmth that would be released is 334.55 KJ/mole, which is a theoretical datum.

EC 1.7.7.2 is a ferredoxin-nitrate reductase that catalyzes an oxidation reaction that shifts nitrite into nitrate. According to the change in enthalpy, it produces heat as well. Used by our previous team as plant-sitter, this enzyme is proved effective.
In order to assess the efficiency of our E.coli babysitter, we have made math models for the core system in it, EC 1.7.7.2, which functions as to heat up the environment to provide a more suitable temperature for the plant.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content2"><DIV class="content2-text"><DIV class="content2-text-content">However, considering the fact that we do not have adequate data to carry out our math models, we finally decide to use proportionality instead of accurate data. Both of the following charts are established by Excel.
The first one is a model under the condition that purely only EC 1.7.7.2 is functioning, which means, the concentration of it remains unchanged: (grey line → temperature inside the system)

</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content1"><DIV class="content1-text"><DIV class="content1-text-content">The second one is a model under the condition that RNA Thermometer in the first part of our entire plasmid is functioning to start the heating-up system which is mostly EC 1.7.7.2 in certain extent of external temperature (&lt;27℃). Since it is being manipulated by the other system, the concentration of EC 1.7.7.2 can no long remain unchanged, but changed over time: (black line → temperature inside the system)
                    General information about EC 1.7.7.2 can be found in the following link: http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ec:1.7.7.2.

1.	BBa_K1687002 is a composite part combining a EC 1.7.7.2
This part, submitted to the Registry, is used in our story “Houyi shoots down sun” in order to simulate the suns, which in our project produce heat and light but is later suppressed. We proudly use this part in our plasmid and are pleasing to report that it really worked. As time goes through, the molarity of nitrite and oxidized ferredoxins reduced like a bow-shaped curve.
Consisting of BBa_K1687000, an RBS (BBa_B0034), a GFP coding sequence and a double terminator (BBa_B0015), this part is able to produce both light and heat, just as the sun functions in the real world.
