Genetic engineering shows its great potential in areas such as medicine, agriculture, food industry and … story telling! We all like stories, from the daily night stories told by our parents during our infancy, to the long novels we read in our youth, stories has become an necessary part of our lives.The living animal characters always fascinate us while the morals underlying the stories permeate through us. Profound morals become much more accessible to people through stories and fables. Therefore we decided to make our E.coli lovely and amicable by making it tell stories like our friends. We choose different parts and construct our E.coli to present stories through its own action.  The project provides children with innovative educative models. This time, E.coli will present Chinese ancient myth “Houyi and ten suns”, Andersen’s tale “Ugly duckling” and Aesop’ Fable “The fox and the grape” to all of you. Enjoy your storytime wth e.coli.

</DIV><DIV class="content1-text-content">    We use Biobricks to connect parts together. The restriction enzyme cutting sites are Ecor1, Xba1, Spe1 and Pst1.</DIV><DIV class="content1-text-title">Design Primers and PCR
</DIV><DIV class="content1-text-content">    In common scenarios, lacI repressor will create leak expression, causing the expression of Plac even without the presence of lactose. However, according to an article, they claim to have found several kinds of “super repressor” with no leak expression. The article has given the gene sequence of these types of “super repressor”, we have chosen one and use PCR conducted site-specific mutagenesis to engineer the part P0412 in order to better achieve the system.
