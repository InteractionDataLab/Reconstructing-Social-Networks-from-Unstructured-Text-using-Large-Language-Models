Background
    As genetic engineering technologies are applied more and more frequently to our daily lives, many people are still not familiar with it. Genetic engineering shows its great potential in areas such as medicine, agriculture, food industry and … story telling! We all like stories, from the daily night stories told by our parents during our infancy, to the long novels we read in our youth, stories has become an necessary part of our lives.The living animal characters always fascinate us while the morals underlying the stories permeate through us. Profound morals become much more accessible to people through stories and fables. Therefore we decided to make our E.coli lovely and amicable by making it tell stories like our friends. We choose different parts and construct our E.coli to present stories through its own action.  The project provides children with innovative educative models. This time, E.coli will present Chinese ancient myth “Houyi and ten suns”, Andersen’s tale “Ugly duckling” and Aesop’ Fable “The fox and the grape” to all of you. Enjoy your storytime wth e.coli.
Enzyme cut and synthesis
    We use Biobricks to connect parts together. The restriction enzyme cutting sites are Ecor1, Xba1, Spe1 and Pst1.
Design Primers and PCR
    In common scenarios, lacI repressor will create leak expression, causing the expression of Plac even without the presence of lactose. However, according to an article, they claim to have found several kinds of “super repressor” with no leak expression. The article has given the gene sequence of these types of “super repressor”, we have chosen one and use PCR conducted site-specific mutagenesis to engineer the part P0412 in order to better achieve the system.
    We create one system for each story. In this magical world with advanced technology, the classic stories and fables become a little different.
"The ugly duckling"
    In this world, green color is the symbol of purity, beauty and elegance. Our duckling is at first colorless, after it goes through the impediment of lactose, it turns green and becomes the swan.
"The Fox and the Grape"
    In this world, grapes give out banana smell. The disgruntled fox not only just walk away and curse the grapes, it also stops the grape from giving out tantalizing smell!
"Houyi Shoots the Sun"
    In this world, suns emit green color and continue rising temperature. Houyi can be controlled by us to shoot the suns. When shooting the sun, Houyi will emit red light passionately.
