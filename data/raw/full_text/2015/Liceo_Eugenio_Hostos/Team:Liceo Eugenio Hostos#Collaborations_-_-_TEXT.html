Our first and one of the most important partners that supported us in this project, inviting us to participate in it was the Universidad Mayor, who provided us with their laboratories, classrooms and counseling for teachers and students of the University. We were taught English On line and were an essential support in the management of funding and logistics to get to Boston and participate in the Jamboree.
Another great work was explore national program reporting and assessment of science and technology; that encouraged us to continue to participate in this project.  A program that has as one of its objectives to develop actions that foster communication between the scientific and technological community, the educational community and the public in general, increasing the number of people who increase their assessment of science and technology as a result of their participation in non-formal education.
Our project not could have developed, if CORFO productive development Corporation will not encourage such initiatives, which have the objective of improving competitiveness and productive diversification in the country through the promotion of investment, innovation and entrepreneurship and strengthening capital human and technological capabilities.
Among others we can mention: to the Ministry of education, Ministry of economy, education Corporation of the Queen and Cas Chile enterprise computing;  that it supported with financing.
