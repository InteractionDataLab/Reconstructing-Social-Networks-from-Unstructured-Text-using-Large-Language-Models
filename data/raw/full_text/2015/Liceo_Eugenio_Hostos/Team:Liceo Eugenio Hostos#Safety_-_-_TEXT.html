Safety in iGEM
we were working in a laboratory with gloves and lab coats even if we do not work with chemicals harmful to health. We use lighters so samples, not to contaminate also use liminal flow Chambers.
Also the first time that they have reached the biobricks had problems in customs it but this year we have not had any problems with customs. Our project as he works with heavy metals we will first make them in small amounts and then increasing to see how it is working for this we will use masks and gloves, to avoid injury in the lungs.
We are always with a University instructor Professor or the Professor of our we are a University instructor Professor or the Professor of our
Please visit the main Safety page to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.
On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can go beyond the questions on the safety forms, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)
Safe Project Design
Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device
Safe Lab Work
What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!
Safe Shipment
Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?
