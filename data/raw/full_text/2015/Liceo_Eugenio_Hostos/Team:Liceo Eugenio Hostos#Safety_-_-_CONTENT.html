We use lighters so samples, not to contaminate also use liminal flow Chambers.
 Also the first time that they have reached the biobricks had problems in customs it but this year we have not had any problems with customs. Our project as he works with heavy metals we will first make them in small amounts and then increasing to see how it is working for this we will use masks and gloves, to avoid injury in the lungs.

The wiki is a place where you can <STRONG>go beyond the questions on the safety forms</STRONG>, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project.

Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:</P><UL><LI>Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis</LI><LI>Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants</LI><LI>Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment</LI><LI>Including an &quot;induced lethality&quot; or &quot;kill-switch&quot; device</LI></UL><H4>Safe Lab Work</H4><P>What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!</P><H4>Safe Shipment</H4><P>Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
