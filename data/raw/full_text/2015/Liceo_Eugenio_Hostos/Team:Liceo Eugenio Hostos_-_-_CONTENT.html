mineral exportation generates huge profits that are useful for their economy development. This 

sounds great and from the mining point of view is perfect making everyone happy, but here is the 

problem that has not been boarded. Who does this job?

The main job is done by miners who crush, dig, and process the minerals for their 

commercialization. This job exposes them to plenty of dangers like the inhalation of crystalize 

silica particle expelled in the mine causing a sickness called silicosis, which consists in an 

inflammation and cicatrization of the lung tissue preventing the proper oxygenation from the air 

we breathe causing physical disability and eventually death. The implementation of protection of 

protection by the miners in their working hours is rarely used and they do not care about the risks. 

to address this problem, we as LICEO_EUGENIO_HOSTOS iGEM created a genetically modified 

bacterium that upon contact with silica particles produces red luminescence, in order to alert 

workers of the presence of silica dust in the environment and raise awareness about the risks to 

which workers are exposed in the mining.</P><H1><FONT face="Dutch801 XBd BT"><B>Story of Hostos Chile</B></FONT></H1><H3>Hostos Chile is one of the first teams from south america that participate in igem, in the start we were more
 
of 20 student but finally were only four the finalists&quot;.</H3><H3><FONT face="Couier Newr">For  be able to be here first , we competed as school , then  us received by us received by the 

teachers of the university mayor, knowledges of biology synthetic , biotecnology and biology molecular for begin our proyect , 

once  idealized our proyect, we presented front to representates of ministery of economics of chile , explora conicyt , 

representates of corfo , authorities of the others school ( san andres of maipu and emilina urrutia ) . in this presentation 

informed us that we been officially registred in igem and begin assembled our bacteria . us working more of 9 month , holidays 

of summer and winter for terminate our bacteria.
