Proyect Motivation
As Chileans , know us the importance of the mining in our country ,
because  this support our economics, but also know us the dangers to
which the miner is exposed ,for  this we like the future of chile,
wanted do thing.
Problem
The mining exposes them to plenty of dangers like the inhalation of crystalize silica particle expelled in the mine causing a sickness called silicosis, which consists in an inflammation and cicatrization of the lung tissue preventing the proper oxygenation from the air we breathe causing physical disability and eventually death.<
What is silica?
Measures taken so far to prevent silicosis. There are several measures that employers and workers can take to prevent silicosis. These include:
Control of widespread exposure to dust, reducing to the minimum the dust presented at the workplace.
Use of abrasive sandblasting materials that are less dangerous to those that contain crystalline silica.
Install controls technicians (localized exhaust ventilation) and methods of containment (Cabinet and jetting machines)to prevent dust from escaping into the air.
Educate workers about the effects of dust from silica in health and appropriate work techniques to reduce dust.
Wet surfaces before cleaning them.
Never sweep, dry or clean the dust out with compressed air.
Carry breathing masks whenever it is necessary to avoid breathing dust.
Realizing that the highest concentrations of silica can be found indoors during tasks such as abrasive blasting or cut with saw bricks, stoneware, etc.
Be placed air supply Respirator masks in case of raising too much dust. Bathe or wash and wear clean clothes before leaving the workplace.
The key points to prevent silicosis are to reduce the airborne dust containing silica and avoid breathing dust containing silica.
Although once it appears there is no cure for this disease, yet it can be prevented completely if employers and employees work together to minimize exposure to silica.
Symptoms:
*Symptoms may not appear in the early stages of chronic silicosis. In fact, chronic silicosis may go undetected for 15 to 20 years after exposure. As silicosis progresses, symptoms may include:
shortness of breath
strong cough
weakness
-Due to the fact that the ability of the body to fight infections can be weakened by the silica into the lungs, furthermore it is possible to suffer from other diseases. These symptoms may worsen over time and cause death.
There are three degrees of silicosis:
Chronic Silicosis: usually occurs after 10 years of exposure to low levels of crystalline silica. This is the most common type of silicosis, especially presented in miners.
Accelerated silicosis: results from exposure to higher levels of crystalline silica and occurs from 5 to 15 years after contact.
Acute silicosis: can occur after only weeks or months of being in contact with very high levels of crystalline silica.The lungs are inflamed enough and can fill with fluid, causing a severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.

RISKS IN UNDERGROUND MINING
ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES
EFFECTS people: Injuries sustained by consumers harms the community occupational injuries, by the staff of the company the loss of employment
psychological sequelae
ENVIRONMENTAL effects the contamination on-site and external: The atmosphere. The water. The soil
ECONOMIC effects: Damage to property the cessation of productive activities the poor quality of the product, loss of market share (sales) a bad image of the company legal responsibilities
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
In our group we have a companion that his cousin has silicosis and gave us the following statement "When I went to do test to find the cause of my discomfort,
I said sir you have the disease mining." "How I thought it was not so bad I took my papers to my new job but to learn that already has a degree of
silicosis made which denied me the opportunity to work here"
Our Proyect
We created a genetically modified bacterium that upon contact with silica particles produces red luminescence, in order to alert workers of the presence
of silica dust in the environment and raise awareness about the risks to which workers are exposed in the mining.
