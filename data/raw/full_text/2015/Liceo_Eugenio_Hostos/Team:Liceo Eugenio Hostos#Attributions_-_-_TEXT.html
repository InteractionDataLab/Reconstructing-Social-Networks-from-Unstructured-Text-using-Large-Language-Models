We as a team were working in the same laboratory as the San_Andres and EMILIA URRUTIA ; We supported each other and while we were not working as a team all helped us to make our projects achieve arise from the idea.
the last team that we got to know was the team UChile-OpenBio and they helped us in the last days of laboratory.
Our project was based on helping the miners, but until we decide to us by this idea we investigated various issues and problems. Then we do a rain of ideas in which the winning groups and groups that were in the home, gathered and commented on it.
This occurred to us working with silica. It was the most promising;  because it covers a social problem of national and international. Then be discussed it to our teacher and teacher assistant, which supported us to follow.
