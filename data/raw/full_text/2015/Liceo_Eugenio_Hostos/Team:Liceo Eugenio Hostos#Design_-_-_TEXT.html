our bacteria has two plasmids simple
the first  produces the adhesion protein to silica L2
the second produces the luminescense red
How does it work?
The first plasmid is the one that produces the protein membrane   to which is subject to the adhesion protein L2 silica which upon   contact with a silica particle sends a signal to the developer   specifies the second plasmid to the start transcribing RFP gene   and red luminescence occur.
the red luminescence that produces our bacteria is a alert , in this way the worker
will know when be in danger.
