There are several measures that employers and workers can take to
prevent silicosis. These include:
<LI>   Control of widespread exposure to dust, reducing to the minimum the dust presented at the workplace.
</LI><LI>   Use of abrasive sandblasting materials that are less dangerous to those that contain crystalline silica.
</LI><LI>   Install controls technicians (localized exhaust ventilation) and methods of containment (Cabinet and jetting machines)to prevent dust from escaping into the air.   
</LI><LI>    Educate workers about the effects of dust from silica in health and appropriate work techniques to reduce dust.
</LI><LI>    Wet surfaces before cleaning them.
</LI><LI>    Never sweep, dry or clean the dust out with compressed air.
</LI><LI>    Carry breathing masks whenever it is necessary to avoid breathing dust.
</LI><LI>    Realizing that the highest concentrations of silica can be found indoors during tasks such as abrasive blasting or cut with saw bricks, stoneware, etc.
</LI><LI>    Be placed air supply Respirator masks in case of raising too much dust. Bathe or wash and wear clean clothes before leaving the workplace.
</LI><LI>    The key points to prevent silicosis are to reduce the airborne dust containing silica and avoid breathing dust containing silica.
</LI><LI>    Although once it appears there is no cure for this disease, yet it can be prevented completely if employers and employees work together to minimize exposure to silica.
</LI></FONT></UL></P><P><I>Symptoms:</I><UL>*Symptoms may not appear in the early stages of chronic silicosis. In fact, chronic silicosis may go undetected for 15 to 20 years after exposure. As silicosis progresses, symptoms may include:
<LI>shortness of breath
</LI><LI>strong cough
</LI><LI>weakness
-Due to the fact that the ability of the body to fight infections can be weakened by the silica into the lungs, furthermore it is possible to suffer from other diseases. These symptoms may worsen over time and cause death.
</LI></UL></P><P><LI>There are three degrees of silicosis:</LI><UL><LI>Chronic Silicosis: usually occurs after 10 years of exposure to low levels of crystalline silica. This is the most common type of silicosis, especially presented in miners.</LI><LI>Accelerated silicosis: results from exposure to higher levels of crystalline silica and occurs from 5 to 15 years after contact.</LI><LI>Acute silicosis: can occur after only weeks or months of being in contact with very high levels of crystalline silica.The lungs are inflamed enough and can fill with fluid, causing a severe shortness of breath and low blood oxygen levels.</LI></UL></P><P><UL><I>Source:</I></UL></P><P><B>RISKS IN UNDERGROUND MINING</B><I>ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES</I><UL><LI>EFFECTS people: Injuries sustained by consumers harms the community occupational injuries, by the staff of the company the loss of employment

Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.

In our group we have a companion that his cousin has silicosis and gave us the following statement &quot;When I went to do test to find the cause of my discomfort,
 I said sir you have the disease mining.&quot; &quot;How I thought it was not so bad I took my papers to my new job but to learn that already has a degree of
 silicosis made which denied me the opportunity to work here&quot;

<H2><FONT face="Dutch801 XBd BT">Our Proyect</FONT></H2><P>We created a genetically modified bacterium that upon contact with silica particles produces red luminescence, in order to alert workers of the presence 
of silica dust in the environment and raise awareness about the risks to which workers are exposed in the mining.</P><H4>References</H4><P>Centros para el Control y la Prevenci√≥n de Enfermedades
