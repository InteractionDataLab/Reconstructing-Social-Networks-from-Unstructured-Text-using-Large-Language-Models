And on behalf of the students of the team, we would especially like to thank our mentor, supervisor, and cool science teacher Mr. Gerry Bourassa for bringing his love of science to our classrooms along with the start of the iGEM in Consort, which in turn sparked other small towns to start their scientific endeavours as well.
We would like to thank...
Emily Hicks and Robert Mayall for their support, expertise, and for not minding when we phoned or Skyped them looking for help on multiple occasions
The iGEM Headquarters and Competition themselves for everything that is happening!
Dr. Ron Watson from Wainwright Dental Care for the autoclave and alginate
Consort Enterprise newspaper for media coverage
Amrinder Grewal, who designed the website
geekStarter for the valuable workshops and cool notebooks

Our team would like to thank all of the people and businesses that contributed not necessarily through monetary donations, but that contributed to our team through their donations of supplies, equipment, advice, and expertise that played a huge role in our development. Your support is much appreciated!
