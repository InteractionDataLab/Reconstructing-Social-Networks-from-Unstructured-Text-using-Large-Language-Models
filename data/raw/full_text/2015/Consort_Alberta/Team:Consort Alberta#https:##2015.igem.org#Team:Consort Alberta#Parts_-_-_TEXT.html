ECOS consists of the following parts:
J23100 - which is a constituent promoter.
B0034 - the RBS for our XylR gene.
I723017 - the XylR coding region which encodes for the transcriptional regulator XylR protein.
B0015 - the double stop codon for this sequence.
I723020 - This is the Pu promoter.
B0030 - RBS.1 strong.
We also attached the Reporter AmilCP in the backbone pCB1C3 to give us an output in correspondence to the level of xylene present.
