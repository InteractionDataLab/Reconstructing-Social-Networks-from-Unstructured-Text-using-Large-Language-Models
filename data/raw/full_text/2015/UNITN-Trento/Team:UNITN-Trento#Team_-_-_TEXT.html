Alessandro Turcato
Hi! I’m Alessandro Turcato. I’m from Marano Vicentino in Veneto (Italy). I’m attending the third year of the "Biomolecular sciences and technologies" B.Sc. program in Trento. I really enjoy playing guitar and soccer. Furthermore, I’m very happy to join the iGEM competition. I’m mainly involved in the MFC part of our project, including the development of our own prototype. I hope you guys enjoy our work. See you in Boston!!
Skills: Physicist of the Group Passionate Scientist
Elisa Godino
Hi! I'm Elisa Godino. I'm 22 years old, and I was born in Cles (TN, Italy). I recently graduated in Biomolecular Sciences and Technology at the University of Trento. I love science, and I'm having a great time with this incredible iGEM experience. I also like going to the lake with friends and playing beach volley. Sometimes, for my teammates' delight, I make cakes! I mainly deal with the Measurement Interlab Study and with Human Practices.
Skills: Queen of Cloning Sweetheart
Claudio Oss Pegorar
Hi! I am Claudio Oss Pegorar. I am 22, and I was born in Trento (Italy). I am studying "Biomolecular sciences and technologies" as a B.Sc. student at the University of Trento. What I like to do other than staying in the lab is playing the guitar, trekking, and hanging out with my friends. I am grateful I had the chance to participate and contribute to this project, and I enjoy every single day as an iGEMer. I am mainly involved in the lab work, InterLab Study, and Safety.
Skills: Human Translator Fluorescence Man
Silvia Galvan
I’m Silvia Galvan. I’m 22 years, and I was born in Borgo Valsugana (Trento), where I live with my family. I am currently a student of the Bachelor of Science in Biomolecular Sciences and Technology program at the University of Trento. My passion is running. I have been into athletics since I was a child. I enjoy spending time with my two lovely nephews and with my teammates, of course! We’re having such a great summer in the lab. The work is hard sometimes, but we have a lot of fun together. I feel really lucky to have had the possibility to be an IGEMer and to have found such a great team! I am mainly dealing with the proteorhodopsin part.            Fun fact: I have a dog named Brick, sometimes I call him BioBrick!
Skills: pH Princess Hearty Eater
Riccardo Corbellari
Hi! I’m Riccardo Corbellari. I was born in Verona, and I’m 21. I’m attending a B.SC. in “Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies” at the University of Trento. I thought I was an only child, but during this summer I found out I have 3 sisters and 3 brothers: my iGEM family! I love playing handball, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. I also like to play around with my teammates but when it’s time to work no one is more serious than me. Mainly I’m involved in the construction of pncB, in developing a functional pMFC, and into designing our prototype.
Skills: Captain of Sequencing Lab Motivator
Veronica Pinamonti
I am Veronica. I was born in Cles, a small town in a small valley near Trento. I’m attending the third year of the "Biomolecular Sciences and Technology" B.Sc. program in Trento. I usually spend my free time with friends at the lake. I really love science and also my teammates (more or less). This summer I’m having such a great time in the lab with them: we laugh hard but work harder. Mainly I’m involved in the retinal expression in E. coli. I hope you will appreciate and enjoy our project as much as I did.
Skills: Spectra Manager Just Pina!
Moreno Zolfo
I am Moreno and I am a 23 years old Master Student at the University of Trento. I am currently attending a Degree Program in Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology after a B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2014 and have a strong interest in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics and Microbiology. In the iGEM Team I mainly take care of the informatic services and wiki-building. I love reading and photography, and I am passionate about asian languages and cultures.
