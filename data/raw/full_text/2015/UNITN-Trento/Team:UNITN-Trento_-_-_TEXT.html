UNITN iGEM 2015
Solar pMFC
A microbial fuel cell with
a light-driven E. coli engine
Electron production with
E. coli and Proteorhodopsin
We are the UNITN-Trento iGEM team 2015 and here is our wonderful idea to change the way people think about Microbial Fuel Cells. We attempted to improve the MFC platform by exploiting the power of the sun and the versatility of Escherichia coli, so we added new interesting features to build a “Solar pMFC”. We presented our work in Boston at the iGEM Giant Jamboree and our work  was nominated among the three top energy projects worldwide. Check out our wiki page to learn more!
