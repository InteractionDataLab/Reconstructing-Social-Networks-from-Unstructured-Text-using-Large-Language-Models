Achievements
Bronze Medal
Achievements
Register the team for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Complete and submit the Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Present a Poster and a Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Create a page on team wiki with clear attributions of each aspect of your project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
BBa_K1604021 .               This BioBrick encodes for β-carotene 15,15’-dioxygenase an enzyme that is involved in retinal biosynthesis. This part is central to our project because in the MFC, our PR-engineered E. coli needs retinal as chromophore for the Proteorhodopsin.
We have submitted also other useful parts. Check out our complete list .
Silver Medal
Achievements
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry.
BBa_K1604031 . This functional BioBrick contains pncB a gene that encodes for the enzyme NAPRTase (nicotinic acid phosphorbosyl-transferase). It catalyzes the formation of nicotinate mono-nucleotide, a direct precursor of NAD, from NA (nicotinic acid).  We built it because we planned to increase electrons production by over-expressing pncB.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
Demonstrate how our team has identified, investigated and addressed some important questions beyond the bench relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights in the context of our project.
We reasoned on household energy consumption in different parts of the world (Europe, America, Asia) looking at different solutions including how synthetic biology can act. We also discussed about the safety and the security of our project and about how our prototype would fit into the real world in a sustainable way, respecting the environment and limiting consume.
Gold Medal
Achievements
Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way.
We tested the platform "LabSurfing" of the team TU_Darmstat.
Improve the function and the characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device.
We improved the part: BBa_K773002
(New entry for this part: BBa_K1604010 )
We improved the proteorhodopsin part that we extracted from the registry adding a RBS, we placed it under an inducible promoter and we fully characterized it to demonstrate that the proton pump does work.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of our project. Show how this system works under real world conditions that we simulate in the lab.
We have built a working prototype of MFC, our "solar pMFC". It works, watch the video of our prototype in action !
