Proteorhodopsin: Silvia , Riccardo and Elisa
Blh: Veronica
pncB: Riccardo
Mtr: Alessandro
The bacterial strains containing Shewanella Mtr electron transport system used in this work were kindly provided by the laboratory of Carolyn Ajo Franklin (Berkeley National laboratory). Giuliano Berloffa from the Mansy lab for helping with some good tips on protein purification and for troubleshooting with the anaerobic chamber
Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)
The small MFCs and some of the materials used in this work were kindly given to us by Martin Hanczyc (CIBIO, Univ. of Trento) and built by Ioannis Ieropoulos (UWE Bristol). The big MFC prototype was designed by Alessandro and Riccardo and assembled using parts of the small MFCs and parts built by the mechanic workshop of the Physics department of the University of Trento. Suresh Bonotto, Damiano Avi, Mariano Dimauro and Gigi Minati provided important technical information for the design of the big MFC.
Interlab Study
Elisa and Claudio . Fabio Chizzolini, Roberta Lentini and Noel Martin from the Mansy Lab helped in the experimental set up of FACS and realtime PCR. Michele Forlin from the Mansy lab helped in generating the Heatmaps to analyze the data.
Wiki
Structure and Design: Moreno . Content and Images: everybody. Gianmarco Franceschini drawn the UNITN-Trento iGEM logo and part of the wiki figures and schemes.
Human Practices
Coordinator: Elisa . Discussion and analysis: everybody
During this summer we received support and help from our great Instructors: Cristina Del Bianco, Sheref Mansy, Olivier Jousson and Martin Hanczyc. Rossella Tomazzolli, Margherita Kos, and Matteo Grott allowed us to work all summer in a safe, clean and well equipped laboratory.
Acknowledgments
We wish to thank the Centre for Integrative Biology (CIBIO) and the University of Trento for supporting our project and team.
We wish to thank Prof. Graziano Guella, who helped us with some chemical issues for carotenoids/retinoids extraction and Luca Matteo from the physics department of UniTN for a crash course in electrical engineering. Additional thanks to Tu-Delft for sending us the plasmids of Mtr and the Guido Grandi Lab at CIBIO (Trento) for providing us the genome of BL21. Alice Spigo drawed the blueprint of the MFC.   At the beginning of the summer we discussed details of our project with Paola Foladori from the  Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering department, which is an expert in MFC and water depuration. Thank you for your suggestions Paola! We also had a very informative chat with Michele Del Fabro on domestic energy waste.
Last but not least we would like to thank our dear friend Damiano Avi, who always finds a way to help the iGEM teams here in Trento!
