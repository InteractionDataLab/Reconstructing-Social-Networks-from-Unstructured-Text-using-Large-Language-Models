In Italy, however, we are not well placed in the field of alternative sources, especially if we consider the technologies available. The social will is there, but unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge about opportunities of alternative sources such as the wind.</P><P class="question wow fadeInDown" style="visibility:hidden; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">Can alternative energy solutions be reached by small consumers or only by large consumers?</P><P style="margin-top:1em">Yes and no. The most sophisticated applications are expensive. There is a middle class of alternative sources. Fundings for alternative energy sources are available, but they are not advantageous. In Italy there are state taxes for producing electricity on your own (i.e. with solar panel). This discourages the consumer to produce energy independently. In other places, such as Denmark, they granted to private citizens big incentives if they produce energy with wind turbines.</P><P class="question wow fadeInDown" style="visibility:hidden; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">From our analysis it seemed that Europe focuses on the redevelopment of buildings, while other countries aim only on new buildings, why? What is your opinion?</P><P style="margin-top:1em">In Italy there is the myth of the âeternal homeâ: houses are never redone but they are rather refurbished. It is ok to preserve some ancient building that stand as a historical memory, but when a house is too old and inefficient there is no reason why it should be kept. In fact, the houses were quickly built after the World War Two, without caring about thermal aspects and leading to a high-energy consumer structure. In other countries money is invested for the realization of new houses, promoting the industrial potential. It may not look like it, but rebuild a house in many cases is cheaper than just keeping an old one for many years.</P><P class="question wow fadeInDown" style="visibility:hidden; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">From our analysis we saw that the domestic energy consumption comes primarily from heating and cooling systems. In an ideal world we should reach a situation where the heating and cooling energy should decrease and gets close to zero. Do you think it is possible?</P><P style="margin-top:1em">This is totally impossible! We must overturn the way we think, especially here in Italy.

Citizens should be educated better on the subject. Another idea could be taxing luxury goods (i.e. cars, gasoline). People are often left unprotected, without any kind of help from the government. What anyone of us can do so far is follow some basic tips to save energy and money (i.e. turn off the TV when you are not home, etc.)</P><P class="question wow fadeInDown" style="visibility:hidden; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">Can a solar panel truly reduce prices?</P><P style="margin-top:1em">Absolutely not, this sector is heavily penalized.The photovoltaic has very low yields, requires high maintenance and the electrical system has to be extremely efficient. The efficiency of the produced current is very low, at about 5-6%. The energy cost is insane and the problem of disposing the panel when they are exhausted is remarkable.</P><P class="question wow fadeInDown" style="visibility:hidden; -moz-animation-delay: 0.5s; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">Leaving out technical difficulties, which hostility can you see about placing on market our project?</P><P style="margin-top:1em">You need to impress and amaze people when looking at you product.
