STUDENTS
We work as a wonderful team. We come from different departments of Fudan. We unite under the Bertalanffy Association. Everyone has earned a position and stuck to it through the whole project. We designed the whole project and did all the experiment by ourselves. We worked in schools and society to educate public with our own efforts. We designed and painted as if we are the greatest art designers. We worked on the modeling and wiki pages day and night to achieve the best. Every bit of effort has together brought here our final presentation. Everyone, well done!
Xilin Jiang
I am a junior in the school of life science, Fudan University. As the team leader, my mission is to coordinate the whole team’s work. I have a strong passion in synthetic biology while always participate in public affairs, so I work both in the lab and in the community. I believe that our team should propagate the basic idea of synthetic biology to the whole school. Consequently, I have paid a lot of attention to the influence of synthetic biology in Fudan, which has the best genetic labs in China. Fudan team is only set for a few months, but I hope we can initiate a trend for synthetic biology for a much longer time.
Yifeng Huang
I’m Yifeng Huang, a junior in School of Life Science, Fudan University. I love science and technology, and I really believe that we can make a better world with advanced technology. I was really fascinated by the idea that we can design and construct biological systems. That’s the reason I participate in iGEM. In the team, I deal with biobrick parts. I’m really looking forward to see what cool things other teams have made. See you in Boston!
Honglin Chen
I am Chen Honglin, a senior student in the school of life science. This is my second time as an iGEMer. Glad to meet everyone here again. My job was to design the project. It was not easy to come up a great achievable idea. After years of reading paper and experimenting, I finally can handle the whole program. I am a huge fun of board game, especially The killer of Three Kingdoms.
Yefan Hu
I’m Ye-fan Hu, a junior student majoring in life sciences at Fudan University. My contributions range from dry lab work to molecular cloning. I hold a firm belief that the meaning to do science is to create a better world for human being, and the key for people’s health issue is biology and medicine. My personal interest focuses on the development and evolution in the field of biology. In part time traditional Chinese culture and computer programming are my favorites.
Xuhang Li
I am Xuhang Li, a junior in school of Bio, FDU. In the team I'm responsible for protein design. I love iGEM because it's a great pleasure to work in a team and solve challenging problems. My other interests are playing computer games. Can't wait to see you in Boston!
Guanghui Chen
I’m Chen Guanghui from School of Life Science. As the only sophomore in this team, I am really glad to work with these wonderful junior students on the experiments and other aspects of scientific research. I’ve learned a lot this year and will be very glad to act as a bridge between younger students and iGEM. I love soccer by the way, and if someone loves FC Barcelona, we will have a lot to talk about!
Xiaojia Liu
I’m Liu Xiaojia, a junior from Fudan University majoring in life sciences. My main job is Molecular cloning. Meanwhile, I’m in charge of our dream lab, the place where we do experiments and try our best to make Fudan igemers’ dream come true. One thing I appreciate most is the chance to work with so many excellent team members and make new friends. I’m sure you all feel the same. See you in Boston!
Huiya Yang
Hey, I am Yang Huiya, a junior in School of Life Science, Fudan University. Since high school, I have loved to explore the unknown world in biology. I am willing to do biological studies in the future. In our iGEM team, I participated in project forming and later was primarily responsible for experiment. Accompanied with E.coli and human cells every day and night is a hard process, but I learned a lot and met plenty of like-minded friends this year. In my spare time, I often go to the gym for strength training. Meanwhile, I can speak a little Korean and French. Can’t wait to see you in Boston!
Xinyuan Zhang
I am Cynthia, junior in School of Life Science, art designer in team and President of Bertalanffy Association in Fudan University. Science, art and friends have always been what I want in university, and iGEM gave me all three and more. It’s really wonderful to work with everyone, to stay in our dream lab, to design all our posters and wiki pages, to run our BA and to educate the public. I love you, iGEM.

Deming Weng
My name is Deming Weng, a student from school of management in Fudan University. I am response for seeking sponsorship and public relationship for our team. Before I change my major into management, I studied Nature Science and my favorite subject is biology. I love biology but it is too hard!! I have a lot of passion for the public good and now I am the minister in Volunteer Division of School of management Student Union. Thank U!
Zihan Chen
I’m Chen Zihan from the department of physics. I have a great interest in biology and simulation. I did some human practice and ran some errands for the team. It’s great to attend the group seminar every time and learn through the other members. By the way, I’m an amateur photographer and a film waster.
ADVISORS
We want to thank our advisors sincerely for their time and patience devoted to our project. They participated actively in our project and helped a lot on safety training. Xuanye is the leader of 2014 iGEM Team Fudan. His experience proved to be invaluable. Hongbo is doing her doctor’s degree. She has always been nice and helpful whenever we ran into troubles. They are both brilliant models on our road to become powerful students and capable scientists.
