DESCRIPTION
We develop several linker based on former linker(BBa_K1486003). For part BBa_K1777017 ，We have optimized the codon for mammalian, and we insert a NLS to promote locating in cell nucleus. Besides ,we lengthen this linker to provide better separation of two domains. At last we avoid tandem repeat sequence(like GGGSPKKKRKVGGGS), which will facilitate fusing this linker to your domains via overlap PCR. (Part BBa_K1777005 , BBa_K1777018 are also designed based on similar consideration)
Apart from that, we use beta-globin intron to provide SA and SD sequence in our circular RNA device( BBa_K1777001 , BBa_K1777002 , BBa_K1777003 ), which is inspired by the beta-globin intron parts（ BBa_K404119 ）. Beta-globin intron provides long flanking intron for circularizing exon and can increase the expression level. We use this character of Beta-globin intron to improve our circRNA expression level.
Apart from all the parts listed above, we have acRNA biobricks and a dozen of cyclizing protein biobrick.( BBa_K1777008, BBa_K1777009, BBa_K1777010, BBa_K1777011, BBa_K1777012, BBa_K1777013, BBa_K1777014,  BBa_K1777004, BBa_K1777005, BBa_K1777017 )
