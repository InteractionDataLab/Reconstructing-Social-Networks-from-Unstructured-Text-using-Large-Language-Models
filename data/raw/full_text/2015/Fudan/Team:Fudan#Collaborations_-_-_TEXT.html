NYU_Shanghai
NYU_Shanghai is a newly developed iGEM team in shanghai, and they are really taking an active part in iGEM competition! We had several meet-ups about how to establish an iGEM team and what are the essential skills in lab. We offered advice on experiments     and running of the team. On August 8th, hey held a wonderful event in Shanghai Science&Technology Museum, which our team also attended. Besides, we shared the iGEM distribution kit with each other. We will have further collaboration in the future!     (See: https://2015.igem.org/Team:NYU_Shanghai/Collaborations )

We shared all the parts in the distribution kit with them, for their kit was seized in the custom.
