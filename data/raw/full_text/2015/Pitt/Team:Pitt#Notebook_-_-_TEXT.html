Note: all experiments were done with all members present, unless otherwise noted
June 15, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Transformation of plasmids from Pardee paper
Into DH5a, all transformations successful
Grow O/N of DH5a
Competent cell prep (Konstantin Borisov)
June 16, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
O/N of transformations
Miniprep
DH5a competent cell prep
25 tubes of 200ul each, enough to last all summer! (Konstantin Borisov, help from Tatyana Yatsenko)
June 17, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Transformation of plasmids from iGEM registry
Into new DH5a, all transformations successful
June 18, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Test PT7 lysate with Pardee paper plasmids
No convenient method of visualization, so we started looking for a plate reader
June 22, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
PCR pSB1C3 with backbone fwd and rev primers
For Gibson assembly, learning process
Gel of PCR products
Visualization and purification of pSB1C3 backbone
Gel purification
Obtained enough backbone for the rest of the summer!
June 23, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Gibson assembly of protease parts from IDT, transformation into DH5a
All transformations multiple colonies
Transformation of CMU ERT7 into DH5a
Success, faint yellow from YFP seen under blue light
June 24, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Miniprep and diagnostic gel of Gibson assembly
All 3 had appropriate bands
Crude lysate preparation from ERT7/DH5a
Original S30 extract protocol, much too dilute due to incorrect weighing
June 25, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Sequencing of Gibson'd protease constructs
5/6 had correct sequence, other one had significant deletion
ERT7 lysate tests on Tecan plate reader
No results because of high dilution
June 29, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Repetition of Pardee experiments
First success!
Freeze-dry constructs on paper
Test validity of Pardee results (Tatyana Yatsenko, Garrett Green)
June 30, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Grow O/N of NiCo21(DE3)
Competent cell prep (Konstantin Borisov)
Test freeze-dried constructs
No results on Tecan reader
July 1, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
NiCo21(DE3) competent cell prep
20 tubes of 250ul each (Konstantin Borisov)
Solution tests of Pardee toehold sensors
No results
July 6, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Restocked solutions, plates and media
Running low on supplies
July 7, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Transform plasmids for ERT7: wildtype T7, T7-YFP, T7 with sites
Controls for estrogen project, into DH5a
July 9, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Created cell lysates from NiCo21(DE3), NiCo21(DE3) with IPTG induction, DH5a, DH5a with ERT7-YRP
Lots of controls
July 10, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Set up PCR for vector backbone
Discovered original vector backbone had been left out and degraded
Prepared glycerol stocks of protease constructs
In NiCo21(DE3) cells
July 11, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Gel electrophoresis on PCR
Gel was run in the wrong direction... lost all DNA
July 13, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Another PCR of vector backbone and Gel
Success! 3 lanes of vector backbone extracted.
July 16, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Gibson of MMP9 fusion and protease reporter, transformation into DH5a
all transformations had a lot of colonies
July 17, 2015
Protocol
Notes/results/purpose
Diagnostic gel of all DNA made
Cut with EcoRI, SpeI (Konstantin Borisov)
