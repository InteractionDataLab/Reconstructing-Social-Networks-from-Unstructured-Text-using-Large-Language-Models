Bug Shoo - an innovative repellent
Our team designed a product, manufactured with tools of synthetic biology, which should be effective in combating diseases transmitted by insect vectors, such as dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever and leishmaniasis. Its active ingredient will be       D-limonene, a terpene naturally produced by citrus plants, which has a repellent effect. Its production will be performed by a specific genic circuit triggered by plasmolysis. It will ensure its functioning just in human skin. After all, bacteria       will dye by an innovative kill switch system. Find out in our project the main characteristics that make Bug Shoo a single repellent which would be presented later to the market. Also, follow along as our team has developed Policy & Practices of       structured activities to raise awareness about dengue fever prevention and Synthetic Biology issues.
