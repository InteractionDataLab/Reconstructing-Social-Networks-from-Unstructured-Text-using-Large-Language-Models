We helped two new team starting to be formed: UNESP_Assis and UNIFEI_Itajub√°
We helped Stockholm , Finland , iGEM_nankai , iGEM Korea_U_Seoul and Brasil-USP Team teams projects
We improved characterization of part BBa_K136016 and reported as BBa_K1620006 . We also have improved another previous part BBa_K519010 generating an improved biobrick BBa_K1620007 more suitable to assemblies.

We submitted new parts ( BBa_K1620000 and BBa_K1620005 ) to iGEM Parts Registry.
We validate experimentally BioBricks BBa_K1620000 and BBa_K1620005 made by us. It worked as expected, and are different from those used for the bronze criteria. Part and device were properly documented in the Registry!
We have developed Human Practices involving various fields such as political, educational and social.
