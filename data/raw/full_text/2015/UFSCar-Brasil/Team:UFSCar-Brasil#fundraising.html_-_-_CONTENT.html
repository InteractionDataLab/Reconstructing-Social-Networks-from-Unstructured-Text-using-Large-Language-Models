    </H3><H3 class="ui header" id="plasmolise">How UFSCar-Brasil managed to raise funds</H3><P>Participate in iGEM demand structure, organization and support. From the assembly of the teams to the registration and participation in the Giant Jamboree, obtaining financial resources is one of the factors that enables the success of a project. Our
    team made great efforts over the year in the search for sponsors and donors for our project. Below we show different forms of fundraising.</P><H3>We present the bacteria i &amp; GEM, official mascots of the team, who assisted in collecting donations throughout the event SBPC! </H3><P>The Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência – SBPC http://www.sbpcnet.org.br/site/) organized <B>the largest scientific event of the Latin America</B>. THis event, named 67th SBPC Annual Meeting,
    took place between July 12th-18th of 2015, in the Federal University of São Carlos’ campus with the main theme &quot;Light, Science and Action&quot;, a reference to the International Year of Light (http://www.light2015.org/Home.html), and inclueded more than
    10 thousand people daily roaming around the event’s activities. </P><P>It was in this context that we gave life to our mascots, which walked through the event’s facilities provoking curiousity not only the children, but also in the adults who struggled to figure out the meaning of the costumes. By the way, many of them
    figured it out! However, others guessed things like carrots and cacti...</P></DIV><DIV class="ui vertical stripe segment stackable container two column very relaxed grid"><DIV class="row"><H2 class="ui header" id="overview">Build your own bacteria costume!</H2></DIV><DIV class="column"><DIV class="ui bulleted list"><P class="item">Materials </P><P class="item"> 1 Semi-sphere Styrofoam (25 cm diameter);</P><P class="item"> 10 EVA foam sheet (You chose the color!);</P><P class="item"> 1 large tube of glue type &quot;superbonder” (Superglue);</P><P class="item"> Styrofoam glue;</P><P class="item"> EVA glue;</P><P class="item"> Hank of wool (flashy colors);</P><P class="item"> 2 meters of Velcro;</P><P class="item"> Scissors;</P><P class="item"> Utility knife;</P><P class="item"> Iron;</P><P class="item"> Sheets of paper. </P></DIV><P>Two sheets of EVA are used to make the &quot;head&quot; of the bacteria. They should be ironed (With a sheet of paper between the EVA sheet and the iron, to prevent it from melting) to become more malleable when shaping to the curvature of the ball. Before
      placing the sheets of EVA over the ball, apply the glue Styrofoam / EVA. Let it dry for a few hours. After that, glue more two EVA foam sheet on the edge of the sphere and give it time to stick. The body of the bacteria is made with 5 EVA foam sheets
      glued with instant glue. In the opening of the costume, where the person gets into,, glue the Velcro. Glue the velcro to the shoulder strap and attach it. It’s important to glue the straps of EVA where you glued the Velcro, to prevent tearing. The
      woolen yarn must be placed on the costume with a big needle, and the gaps for the eyes cut with scissors.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="ui vertical stripe segment stackable container"><H3 class="ui header" id="plasmolise">Sponsors List</H3><P>In January and February, the team's efforts were intended to raise the amount required to pay the Team registration. We prepared a list of 245 companies of various sizes and areas and made contact via email with these potential partners by sending a
    portfolio that explained our achievements in 2014 and our goals in 2015.</P><P>Among the contacts, we received few replies. Some companies have helped us with the supply of reactants and equipment. In some meetings, it became clear the impact that competition has in the world, as well as the grandeur of the iGEM projects. It was
    demonstrated by the interest of a company to get to know synthetic biology. Even so, the fact we did not have a prototype of the repellent difficult obtaining support.</P><P>The team tried to present the project to a large manufacturer of repellents, but there was no interest. Finally, a few weeks before the registration deadline of participants for the Giant Jamboree, Libbs pharmaceutical company offered us support, making
    it possible to send five of our students to Boston.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui vertical stripe segment stackable container"><H3 class="ui header" id="plasmolise">Donations</H3><P>A significant portion of our resources came through online donations (known in Brazil as &quot;Vakinha&quot;). In addition, the team held a fundraising task force at UFSCar for months. Team members took turns in visiting various University departments asking
    for contributions to our piggy bank. This approach to people explained the competition, the importance of our participation and our project mobilized the community. Donations we got were essential to our registration for the competition, in addition
    to disclosing both iGEM and Synthetic Biology across the University.</P><P>We announced our support requests on our Facebook page. We received donations from different regions of Brazil, as well as from members of other iGEM teams. With the resources of online donations, we were able to buy primers and other inputs.</P><H5 class="ui center aligned header">Our money box!</H5></DIV><DIV class="ui vertical stripe segment stackable container"><H3 class="ui header" id="limoneno">Selling chocolates</H3><P>In Brazil, both brigadeiro as Easter eggs are traditional and extremely popular candies. Selling them mobilized the team and had some importance in fundraising.</P><P>We sold brigadeiros in the busiest places in the University: restaurant, snack bars, offices and library. We innovated the traditional candy with the creation of brigadeiro limonene, which had lemon flavor and referred to bug-shoo. The sale of brigadeiro
    was a success!</P><B>Do you want to sell brigadeiros for iGEM 2016? We’re sharing the traditional brigadeiro recipe below! Be creative and make candies referring to your iGEM projects.</B><P>Besides the brigadeiros, we also sold Easter eggs in March and April. We announced the sale on Facebook and we had some orders. The team met to make chocolate eggs. We have not had much success in this attempt to get money, since most buyers were close
    friends and family.</P><P>And in August, we raffled a basket of chocolates. We sold about 180 numbers and raised a considerable sum.</P><P>IMPACT: besides obtaining resources, the sale of chocolates has always provided us opportunities to talk to many people about our Bug Shoo project and Synthetic Biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="ui vertical stripe segment stackable container"><H3 class="ui header" id="plasmolise">Institutional support</H3><P>Our University has supported us with sufficient resources to pay for registrations (for the team and for 2 individual team members) and airline ticket for 1 team member.</P></DIV><H3 class="ui center aligned header">Our amazing sponsors!</H3><DIV class="ui inverted vertical footer segment" style="padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;"><DIV class="ui fluid container"><DIV class="ui stackable inverted divided equal width stackable padded grid"><DIV class="column"><H4 class="ui inverted header">Links</H4><DIV class="ui inverted link list"><A class="item" href="https://igem.org/Main_Page">iGEM</A><A class="item" href="http://www2.ufscar.br/home/index.php">UFSCar</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><H4 class="ui inverted header">About</H4><DIV class="ui inverted link list"><A class="item" href="https://2015.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:UFSCar-Brasil/team.html">Team</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="column"><H4 class="ui inverted header">Thanks for reading our wiki!</H4><P>Come Again :)</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
