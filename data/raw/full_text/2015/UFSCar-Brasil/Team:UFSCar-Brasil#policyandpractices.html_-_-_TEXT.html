UFSCar-Brasil Team impacting society
Overview
The set of P & P activities represents all dimensions reached by project developed by iGEM teams. Brasil-UFSCar team held a series of activities that explored different aspects that bug-shoo reached in society. Since dengue affects all social classes and the solution lies in solving social, political and educational problems, our main motivation was to address the diversity that characterizes our society and the various problems related to dengue. So we developed activities with children from a poor community and we had the opportunity to know the reality of public service at our City Hall. We also deepened our involvement in education, promoting interactions between academic community and basic education, discussing the role of the University in social demands. We knew administrative sectors of UFSCar and created ways to raise money. We debated with other Brazilian teams. We also prepared a law project which provides free distribution of less toxic repellents without DEET. Finally, we reflected on aspects of our project that may be relevant to other teams, and how our experience can contribute to the formation of new iGEM teams. We hope our experiences can contribute to the consolidation of synthetic biology in Brazil.
Political
The team proposed a law project that aims for the free distribution of repellents without DEET. We also held a debate with professionals from different fields, which helped us to discuss limitations and different aspects of our project. Read more

Social
Activity in the Sao Carlos VIII (a poor neighborhood) aimed to educate children about the relation between dump and dengue. The team presented the play "Mighty bacteria against dengue", covering the main aspects of the disease, prevention and the       role of science in solving problems.

Educacional
On several occasions we present synthetic biology and its applications to groups with different educational levels. We launched a Seminar Cycle for academic community of the University, we offer workshops and presented our project at scientific meetings.       Read more Read more

Safety/Security
To ensure that limonene was actually a compound of low toxicity compared to DEET, we conducted a simple experiment using beans that received different treatments.

Meetings
Three Brazilian participating teams of the iGEM 2015 assembled at Jambor√© Brazil, in July. The interaction between the teams allowed the discussion of the projects, discussion of proposals and challenges that the teams will possibly face in the Giant       Jamboree. Read more.
