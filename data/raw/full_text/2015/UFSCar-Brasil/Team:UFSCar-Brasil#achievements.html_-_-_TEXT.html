What we do
Overview
During laboratory activities realized by UFSCar-Brasil team, was obtained different results for the proposed project, as well as the contribution with new biobricks for registry and new protocols for scientific community use in forward projects. Based       on molecular biology, bioinformatics and microbiology techniques, our Team could propose protocols and biobricks, which assist obtaining protein of difficult expression through the UspA promoter, as well as maintaining bacterial viability at room       temperature by plasmolysis induced polyethylene glycol. Thus, we believe that with the expansion of synthetic biology to market manufactures, our protocols represent an important tool in enabling bacteria genetically engineered shelf products.
Another important point refer to the following project's module, characterized by overexpression of chaperones during cell growth and the utilization of a biosafety method as Killswitch; Developed by UFSCar-Brasil team, these modules can also represent       important tools that envisaged the viability and theoretical basis of the project. We believe that, although many structural and funding problems, attach ourselves to the iGEM spirit and we achieved great achievements, and through impressive results       in the laboratory, which are described below, contribute to the development of synthetic biology.
Parts
Here UFSCar-Brasil presents submitted parts to registry, allied to those used by us. In this sense, we submitted 11 new biobricks, being: 3 intermediate parts, 2 composite parts and 6 new simple parts. Our main goal was to design, build and test UspA promoter considered our best part.

Result
Here we presented all results of our work. We obtained new biobricks, generated characterization information. Although do not achieve a functional prototype, we design mathematical methods and lab protocols to further testings. We also report all steps     of biobricks and testing obtaining. Finally, we also reported plasmolysis experiment, where we could observe a great viability after 7 weeks using a cost effective and simple treatment, which could help transpass in the future our manufacturing tracking     project into a real product.
