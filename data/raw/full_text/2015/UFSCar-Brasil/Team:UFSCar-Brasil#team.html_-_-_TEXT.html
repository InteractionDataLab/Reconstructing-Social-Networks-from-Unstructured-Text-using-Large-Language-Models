Team
Who we are
Augusto Furio Balula
Shy or discreet? In the Augusto's silence we observe his qualities: intelligence, solidarity, focus, determination, persistence, and so on. "Augusto Boy" or "Little Augusto" is a master's degree candidate in genetics and he has expertise in molecular           biology of microorganisms.
Bárbara de Abreu Francisco
Barbara is a student of Engineering Physics and worked with the mathematical modeling of our project. She also contributed photographing and recording different team activities, wiki organization and new ideas. She is a beginner to synthetic biology           who learns quickly and hopes to participate in its construction in the university.
Beatriz Brambila
Beatriz is a 2nd year student in Biotechnology Course. She participates in the activities in molecular biology lab. Outside the lab, she has contributed in various other activities. She has contacts with graphic designers that are of great value. Always           works hard and always cheerful. And she looks great dressed as a bacteria.
Célio Dias Santos Júnior
CelioPedia or EncycloCelio? He is a very intelligent and funny master student. He operates in the group at the laboratory, but also has great participation in modeling. He greatly helps the graduating students with a foothold for them, and we always have fun with his jokes.
Daniel Fernando Coletta Silva
Daniel, better known as Cowboy, is an undergraduate student in Biotechnology Course. He works more actively in the laboratorial part, however he is always acting in several areas of our project. If you need someone           to wear a suit and ask for sponsorship in companies and the city hall, he is the guy. Cowboy is a very fun and intelligent man, which is always responsible to amuse our weekly meetings with his unexpected jokes and funny comments.
Gabriel Oliveira da Silva
He is an undergraduate student in Image & Sounds Course. His exceptionally intelligence and creativity transformed the team's theory/results/ideas in modern art that can be seen in our wiki page illustrations.
José Claudio Corsaletti Filho
Who is Zé Claudio? He is a college student of Physical Engineering at Federal University of São Carlos and performed the mathematical modeling of our iGEM project. Zé is a guy who enjoys learning about new things and says it’s been           a rewarding challenge to participate in the synthetic biology project and learn more about that. Moreover… some of his friends say that he’s always busy playing online games when they need him to talk about the news…
Leonardo Delphito
Leonardo Delphito is a 4th year student in Biotechnology Course (Araras campus). He is working in the molecular biology lab and contributing in organizing documents and protocols. He also collaborates with the graphic part of the work. He has interests in several areas           for example: molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics, astrobiology and astronomy. But mostly he intends to participate in this revolution called synthetic biology.
Luani Rezende Godoy
Luani is a student of the first year of Biotechnology at UFSCar . Participates in the Policy & Practices activities and assists the team in other parts of the project. Luani got famous for wearing the bacteria costume.
Isabella Takahashi Kitano
Isabella, popularly known as Zaki, studies Biotechnology Course. Her shyness is not able to hide the greatness of her proactivity at the University and iGEM team. Currently, she works with microorganisms, but in the near future we will see           Dr. Zaki in the lead of research on synthetic biology in plants.
Matheus Pedrino Gonçalves
Matheus Pedrino is a Biotechnology undergraduate. He is always concerned about social issues. He is a very kind person who everyone likes.Some people say he has the most beautiful eyes of Campus.
Vitor Rangel
Vitor is a student of the computing engeneering. In the iGEM, he is responsible for the wiki. He has a lot of ideas and he’s very proactive, besides having much knowledge in the programming area.
Advisor
Dr. Daniela Modna
Daniela, also known as Dani, is the technician of teaching laboratory in our department. She worked in the organization of Policy & Practices activities, acted in fundraising, did proofreading and also made our bacteria costumes. There is no problem           that Dani can not resolve.
Instructors
Dr. Flavio Henrique Silva
Professor Flavio Henrique Silva is one of the founders of the Bachelor’s in Biotechnology Course at UFSCar - São Carlos. He is always interested to contribute with the undergraduation degree and its students; it’s the second           time that he is an instructor of a brazilian team in iGEM. His research field is based on molecular biology applied to the control of sugar cane pests and metagenomics of Amazon rivers and lakes looking for genes with biotechnological applications.
Dr. Francis de Morais Franco Nunes
Professor Francis started his experience as iGEM Instructor in 2014, in Brasil-SP team. Besides devoting to research in genetics and genomics, systems biology and phenotypic plasticity of bees, he is also a person who inspires those around him to believe in their potential. He is the main enthusiast for the team, which encourages us to overcome the difficulties ("yes, we can!"). He is a genuine gold-standard iGEM Instructor!
Dr. Iran Malavazi
Professor Iran Malavazi teaches Biochemistry in UFSCar. His research field is Genetics of filamentous fungi. He is one of the most admired teachers in the course of Biotechnology, and highly committed with quality of education offered to our students.           He is a great supporter of UFSCar-Brazil team.
Dr. Paulo Teixeira Lacava
Professor of Basic and Applied Microbiology with expertise in biotechnology process applied to environment. He works with Agricultural Microbiology, Environmental Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Plant-Microorganism Interaction and Microbial Biological           Control.
