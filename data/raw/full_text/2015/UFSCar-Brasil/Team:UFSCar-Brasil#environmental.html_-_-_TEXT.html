Comparison of DEET and D-limonene effects on beans development
Safety/Security
Introduction
Although poisoning by DEET (active ingredient of the most common commercial repellents) and D-limonene are rare events, it is known that these two substances may be toxic. The absorption of high concentrations of DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) can     have neurotoxic effect and even be lethal (1,2,3,4,5). D-limonene, if ingested in high concentrations may also cause death (6).
Therefore, we conducted a simple test on an eukaryote model to compare the effect of the two substances on beans development (Phaseolus vulgaris,Fabaceae).
Methods
In order to reduce fungal contamination, water and cotton used in the experiment were sterilized by autoclaving. Beans seeds were immersed in 2.7% hypochlorite and then in 70% ethanol (5 minutes for each solution). The seeds were divided into 5 groups     corresponding to five different treatments), each containing 16 individuals. Each seed was placed on a piece of cotton inside a plastic cup. The groups were placed on a bench in order to receive the same illumination.
All seeds initially received 2 mL of water. Treatments were initiated after 24 hours. We adapted limonene concentrations (Limonene 1 - non lethal; Limonene 2 - lethal) to seeds size, according to a prior study of toxicity reported by (6). The following     treatments were administered every 24 hours:
Experiment was initiated in August 11th and treatments lasted from August 12th to 20th.
Analysis of results
Beans development
At the end of the experiment, all individuals in each group were measured, as seen below:
There was a significant difference between the growth of limonene 1 and control groups compared to the group receiving DEET and limonene in higher concentration, as already noted (6).
Figure 1: Differences between beans seedlings development under different treatments. Different letters above the error bars indicate significant differences at the 0.05 level using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc pairwise multiple comparison test according to Nemenyi. Statistical inferences were made using R package.
Conclusions
Control 1 and 2 groups, as well as Limonene 1 did not affect beans development. DEET toxicity was confirmed, once nether beans nor fungi were able to develop in the group treated with the repellent containing DEET. Treatment with high concentrations     of limonene also affected the development of seeds.
Notes
It is important to report some observations during the experiment: (1) plastic cups containg bean seeds were corroded by repellent with DEET; (2) we observed fungi development around the seeds under all treatments, except in DEET group. We believe     those observations reinforce DEET toxicity.
