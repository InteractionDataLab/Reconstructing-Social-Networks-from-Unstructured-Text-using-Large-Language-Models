About our lab
For the execution of our project, the team conducted their work in two laboratories located at Federal University of São Carlos. To perform plasmolysis project, we use the Laboratory of Microbiology and for the construction and characterization of biobricks,     zinc resistance tests and other experiments, we had the structure of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
The experiments performed in the Laboratory of Microbiology tested various concentrations of PEG to promote cell plasmolysis. To achieve this objective we count on laminar flow cabinets, centrifuges and spectrophotometers. In the Laboratory of Molecular     Biology, all the handling of biological material was performed in a laminar flow. In addition, we used biological shakers with monitored temperature, spectrophotometers, thermocyclers, water bath, UV gel image system , UV transilluminator and Nanodrop.     The labs are classified as Biosafety Level 1. In a period of two months, we had four team members working on labs activities: Daniel, running the front of microbiology and Célio, Isabella and Augusto working together in the molecular biology lab.     In our intense routine, we have registered seven hours of work in a day. Please, find more details in the link below
About our Lab
Safety
All our team members respected the biosafety guidelines at the laboratories. It included rules about protocols in the lab, use of appropriated clothing and protective equipment, use of machines, safety decontamination methods and practices, prevention     of the transfer of genetic material and microorganisms and correct handling of chemicals. The strain we are working is E.coli, classified in Biosafety Level 1. Escherichia coli can cause health issues, but if it is handled with precaution, the risk     is minimal. As our project only involve bacteria that present low health risk, for the development of the project, both of laboratories we work are Biosafety Level 1. We use a manual of good practices and safety during the work of the iGEM. Our guideline     is called "Safety Manual laboratory" 3rd edition, wich can be found here .
