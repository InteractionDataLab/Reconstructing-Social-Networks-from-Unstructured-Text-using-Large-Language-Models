What did we build?
Used Parts
Promoter J23101 ( BBa_J23101 )
This promoter part can be used to tune the expression level of constitutively expressed parts.
Ribosome binding site ( BBa_B0030 )
Strong RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis.
Terminator B0015 ( BBa_B0015 )
The mfold results are annotated with the location of the subparts BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 and the BioBrick assembly scar.
Weak Terminator B0010 ( BBa_B0010 )
Terminator weaker than B0015.
GFP generator device ( BBa_E0840 )
It takes as input a transcriptional signal (PoPS) and produce as output the fluorescent protein GFP.
Limonene synthase gene with ribosome binding site ( BBa_I742111 )
Ribosome binding site attached to Limonene Synthase gene (LIMS1) from Citrus limon. Limonene synthase enzyme produces (+)-limonene from farnesyl diphosphate (an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway). (+) Limonene is a component of lemon scent.
Our Simple Parts
Promoter element UspA ( BBa_K1620000 )
It is a stress sensitive promoter isolated from E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome. Its activity is regulated by sigma 70 factor and is modulated by alohormone ppGGp.
Promoter element Zasp ( BBa_K1620001 )
It is a zinc activity sensing promoter element. The regulation of this promoter is Zur dependent and positive in absent of zinc or other divalent metallic cations in medium. The Zur protein binds those cations repressing the expression of the gene downstream Zasp element.
Small heat shock protein IbpA ( BBa_K1620002 )
IbpA is a small heat shock protein. It is expressed under stress conditions which associate with aggregated proteins. It acts together with IbpB to stabilize and protect aggregated proteins from irreversible denaturation and extensive proteolysis during heat shock and oxidative stress.
Small heat shock protein IbpB ( BBa_K1620003 )
IbpB is a small heat shock protein. It is expressed under stress conditions which associate with aggregated proteins. It acts together with IbpA to stabilize and protect aggregated proteins from irreversible denaturation and extensive proteolysis during heat shock and oxidative stress.
Zinc uptake regulation protein - Zur ( BBa_K1620004 )
Acts like a negative controlling element of promoter Zasp (BBa_K1620001) by use of Zn2+ as a cofactor to bind the operator of the repressed genes (znuACB). In E. coli, Zur is known to exhibit sensitivity to femtomolar levels of free intracellular zinc (Outten & Oâ€™Halloran) and regulates the high-affinity zinc uptake system ZnuACB (Patzer & Hantke).
Synechococcus metallothionenin A - SmtA ( BBa_K1620007 )
SmtA is a metallothionein which bind to divalent metallic cations such as Zn(II). This SmtA was an improvement of the biobrick BBa_K519010 originally cloned from Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, a cyanobacterial strain. This part was designed to eliminate an internal restriction site for PstI, the 98th base was changed G -> A. No residues were changed.
Our Composite Parts
GFP device responsive to environmental stresses ( BBa_K1620005 )
This device takes environmental stresses as input a transcriptional signal (PoPS) and produce as output the fluorescent protein GFP.
Constitutive GFP Producing Device ( BBa_K1620006 )
This device uses a strong constitutive promoter to generates GFP constitutively. It is useful to promoter strength comparison.
Our Intermediate Parts
K1620004:B0015 - Zur+Term ( BBa_S05281 )
B0030:K1620004 - RBS+Zur ( BBa_S05282 )
K1620007:B0015 - SmtA+Term ( BBa_S05284 )
