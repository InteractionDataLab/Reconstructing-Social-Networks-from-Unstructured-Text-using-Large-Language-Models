UFSCar-Brasil Team impacting society
Overview
The set of P & P activities represents all dimensions reached by project developed by iGEM teams. UFSCar-Brasil team held a series of activities that explored different aspects that Bug Shoo reached in society. Since dengue affects all social classes       and the solution lies in solving social, political and educational problems, our main motivation was to address the diversity that characterizes our society and the various problems related to dengue disease. So we developed and performed activities with children from       a poor community (see São Carlos 8) and we had the opportunity to know the reality of public health service at our City Hall. We also deepened our involvement in education, promoting interactions between academic community and basic education, discussing the role of the       University in social demands. We knew administrative sectors of UFSCar and created ways to raise money. We debated with other Brazilian teams. We also prepared a law project which provides free distribution of less toxic repellents without DEET.       Finally, we reflected on aspects of our project that may be relevant to other teams, and how our experience can contribute to the formation of new iGEM teams. We are convinced that our iGEM experiences impacted the society around us and also that we really contributed to the consolidation of synthetic biology in Brazil.
Political
The team proposed a law project that aims for the free distribution of repellents without DEET. We also knew the official record system related to epidemic data in Brazil and reported difficulties we experienced...

Social
Activity in the Sao Carlos 8 (a poor neighborhood) aimed to educate children about the relation between dump and dengue. The team presented the play "The mighty bacteria against dengue", covering the main aspects of the disease, prevention and the       role of science in solving problems.

Educational
On several occasions we present synthetic biology and its applications to groups with different educational levels. We launched series of seminars for University community, we offered workshops and presented our project at scientific meetings.

Safety/Security
To ensure that limonene was actually a compound of low toxicity compared to DEET, we conducted a simple experiment using beans that received different treatments.

Problems
The problems with BioBricks delivery and possible solutions that would make this procedure easier. See how our team has overcome this problem.

Meetings
Brazilian iGEM teams met at Jamboré Brazil, in July. The interaction between the teams allowed the discussion of the projects, discussion of proposals and challenges that the teams will possibly face in the Giant Jamboree.
