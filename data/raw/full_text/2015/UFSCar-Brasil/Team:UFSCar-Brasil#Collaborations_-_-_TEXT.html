How iGEM UFSCAR-Brasil collaborated with iGEM Teams
Our Team collaborated with the national and international Times project, along with mentoring  two new Brazilian teams. We contributed online surveys of 4 teams and we think that this type of contact should be encouraged. Follow along as we share and collaborate with different teams:
Help Stockholm , Finland , iGEM_nankai and iGEM Korea_U_Seoul Teams by completing their survey forms. We also cooperate in filling the iGEM Global Cooperation, a form developed by several times, including Brasil-USP Team . The highlight was Team of Stockholm ,     which dealt with the negative results presented in Wikis, a point discussed in our weekly meetings. We Thank the three teams in question for their contact and hope that the answers have helped their respective Human Practice activities.
Aid the Stockholm and IISER iGEM Teams in the g-blocks design for the construction of the gene circuit for their project. Our idea was to contribute to and give instructions on how to design and provide the best results in their amplification experiments and construction of their gene circuits.
One of the great experiences we had as a team was the help we offered to future Brazilian teams  ( UNESP-Assis and Unifei-Itajubá ), who got to know the iGEM participation in Jamboré and 4Biotec events. To our excitement, those who are interested in setting up new teams are students inspired by projects such as Brazil-SP , represented     by members of our current staff. This shows the power iGEM presents and its growth potential in Brazil. As well as perform in-person contacts with students during the previously mentioned events, we are also assisting the assembly of teams via Skype. Below we list the main aspects that deal with competition and the challenges of creating a team in Brazil:
Set up a multidisciplinary team, organiz and present members interested in working with energy for synthetic biology
Seek financial resources in many different ways, either by simply selling chocolates or by contacting your local University. Organize the team's finances and enroll in the Giant Jamboree.
Have weekly meetings, gather people interested in synthetic biology, study together and think of innovative projects that can help your community
Enjoy and learn how to work in teams
Seek the support of teachers and heads of laboratories. This is key to running a iGEM project
Know and learn the techniques behind lab protocols
UNIFEI Team - Thank you letter

After its useful life tires are transformed into waste and may accumulate water, contributing to the proliferation of mosquitoes. This year, Brasil-USP team approached the issue of rubber and tires disposal. In this context, we included this theme into our  script theater along with trash and dengue issue. Therefore, we invited the Brasil-USP Team team to collaborate with us in the activities developed in the neighborhood São Carlos 8.
