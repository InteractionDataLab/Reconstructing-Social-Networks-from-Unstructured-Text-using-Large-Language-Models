The structure for Alyteserin-1a is not available therefore we obtained the pdb structure for Alyteserin-1c (pdb id : 2L5R) and created the given mutations in pymol. We carefully analyzed the structural feature of Alyteserin-1a peptide to come up with another peptide which could interact with it. We seem to find an interesting pattern which was a hydrophobic groove on one side of the peptide. We targeted this region to neutralize the anit-microbial peptide.</P><H2>Predicting the structure of Naly</H2><P>In our project, a key step was to neutralize the antimicrobial peptide, Alyteserin-1a, so that we can create a stress free environment. For this, we designed a novel peptide of smaller length, which can interact favorably with Alyteserin-1a. We used following step to get the best possible peptide :
<UL><LI> We used pepstr, an online tool, which takes amino-acid sequence as input and gives us possible structures, in pdb form, of the protein.</LI><LI> After getting several possible structures, we used another online tool, ZDOCK, which docks two molecules and give a score, which tells us about that how favorably peptides are interacting.</LI><LI>We screened few peptides from above process and proceeded for MD simulations.</LI></UL></P><H2>Molecular Dynamics Simulation</H2><P>We performed molecular dynamics simulation experiments to confirm that Naly is able to interact with Alyteserin-1a antimicrobial peptide, hence it can neutralize it's activity to kill the pathogemic bacteria. Following are the steps that we followed in this experiment :</P><OL><LI>Convert both the pdb files to .gro files and get the topology files using pdb2gmx tool. Use GROMOS96 53a6 force field.</LI><LI>Change the positions of both the peptides in a way that they are far away and disoriented.
</LI><LI>Build the .gro file for the complex (both proteins) by merging the above .gro files. Create the .top file for  complex both peptides.</LI><LI>Define the box for the complex and solvate with water molecules.</LI><LI>Add NA+ and CL- atoms to neutralize the charge of whole system. Create the index.ndx file using make_ndx.</LI><LI>Prepare the .tpr file for energy minimization step.</LI><LI>Steepest descent minimization algorithm was used for a maximum of 50,000 steps.</LI><LI>Position restrain the water molecules in complex.top file.</LI><LI>NVT equilibrate the system. We used leap-frog integrator, lincs constraint_algorithm, Particle Mesh Ewald for electrostatic interactions, position restrain both the peptides, reference temperature 300K with no pressure couppling for 50,000 max steps.</LI><LI>NPT equilibrate the system with Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling.</LI><LI>Run the NPT for a total of five times with position constraint [fcx, fcy, fcz] values 1000, 100, 10, 1, in both posre_.itp file. Use the output of one step as the input for the nnext step.</LI><LI>Final production run for 30,000 ps.</LI></OL><H2>Analyzing the md simulation</H2><P>Once we have run the md simulations, we need to validate the simulation based on several parameters, follow the following protocol to obtain and see the results. </P><OL><LI>Using index.ndx file, remove the water and other atoms i.e. NA and CL from the system.</LI><LI>Use the complex.gro file and .xtc file to see the simulation in vmd.</LI><LI>Using the .edr file calculate different parameters like potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, radius of gyration etc. to prove your hypothesis. </LI></OL><H2> Preparing Ultra-competent cells</H2><P>To get good transformation efficiency from <EM>E. coli</EM> cells, we prefer ultra-competent cells rather normal chemical competent cells.
