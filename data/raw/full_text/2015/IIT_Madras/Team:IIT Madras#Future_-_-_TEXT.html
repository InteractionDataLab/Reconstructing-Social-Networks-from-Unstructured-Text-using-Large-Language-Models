Through this project, we aim to investigate a few questions and hypothesis:
Is bacterial resistance a big cause of concern when using antimicrobial peptides?
Are oscillations in cell population observed when our system is used? Are the oscillations damped?
How effective is the activity of NAly in neutralising the effects of Alyteserin?
