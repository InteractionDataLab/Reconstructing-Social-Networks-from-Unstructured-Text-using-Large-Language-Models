Hello! We're the iGEM 2015 team from IIT Madras, India. Welcome to our wiki page. We are trying to develop a system that can tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance. Read on to learn more!
Antimicrobial agents like antibiotics and other drugs have served us well for over 70 years. However, they have been used so widely and for so long that the microbes that were supposed to be killed by the antibiotics have adapted to them! Antimicrobial resistance is a serious issue today, and could grow to become even worse in the future. A WHO report in April 2014 states that:
"this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health."
Our iGEM project aims to tackle the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance by leveraging the power of evolution and natural selection under selective pressure, and synthetic biology.
