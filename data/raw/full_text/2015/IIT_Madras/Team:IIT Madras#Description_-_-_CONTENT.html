Here, we have choosen a problem to prove the model.</P><P><EM>E. coli</EM> O157:H7 and <EM>Salmonella typhimurium</EM> are gram -ve pathogens, which can infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts. These pathogens can also be present in food and can infect the organism feeding on it. Therefore, we make a system, which would be able to handle these pathogens. 

</P><P>Also, we would use the <EM>Lactococcus lactis</EM> strain as prebiotic to cure animals, humans and eliminate pathogens from food.</P><H2>Our Solution</H2><P>We will synthesize a bacterial system that:</P><OL><LI> Senses the cell density of pathogenic bacteria</LI><LI> Our system releases anti-microbial peptides which kill pathogens, when it has sensed high cell density</LI><LI> As the population goes down we release a peptide that neutralizes the activity of anti-microbial 
peptides, resulting into a stress free environment.The stress-free environment would be favourable to 
the wild type compared to the mutants which have developed antibiotic resistance</LI></OL><P>Consequentially this will lead to a population of predominantly wild type bacteria. Again, as the 
population of wild type goes up, the same cycle of steps 1-3 is repeated. After few cycles, the pathogens 
should be eliminated.</P><P>The system we propose will use an anti microbial peptide Alyteserin, which has bactericidal 
effects. Alyteserin-1a has a lethal effect on gram negative bacteria. We have designed a
novel short peptide sequence (which shall be called Naly from herein). Molecular Dynamics
simulations of Alyteserin-1a and Naly have been performed under various conditions and conformations, 
and we have found that the two peptides interact favourably (check out the In-Silico section under project in the menu bar for animations).</P><P>The pathogen of interest, which has to be a gram negative bacterium in this case was chosen to 
be <EM>E. coli</EM>. We chose <EM>E. coli</EM> for its ease of availability in a laboratory setting, but Alyteserin-1a
is a broad antimicrobial peptide and is effective against a wide range of gram negative bacteria
including <EM>E. coli</EM> and <EM>Salmonella Typhi</EM>.</P><P>We chose the carrier of the AMP to be <EM>Lactococcus Lactis</EM>, for several reasons. <EM>L. lactis</EM> is a
gram positive bacterium. This ensures that the AMP would not have lethal effects on <EM>L. lactis</EM>
itself. Also, <EM>L. lactis</EM> is a non-pathogenic bacteria, and will not elicit an inflammatory response
from the human immune system. Developing the genetic circuit for timed release of AMP and its
inhibitory molecule inside <EM>L. lactis</EM> will provide more scope in the future for developement of a robust
drug delivery system. </P><H2>How does the circuit work?</H2><FIGURE><DIV style="text-align: center;"><FIGCAPTION>Schematic of the circuit's functioning.</FIGCAPTION></DIV></FIGURE><P>Most pathogenic microbes secrete quorum sensing (QS) molecules like AHL, AI-2 when present in high
cell density. QS molecules are sensed by receptor proteins on the cell surface of pathogens. These
signaling molecules help them in regulating their communal activities.</P><P>In the lab, we will be using <EM>E. coli</EM> DH5α strain as pathogenic model. <EM>E. coli</EM> DH5α does not secrete quorum sensing molecules natively. Therefore, we will genetically modify <EM>E. coli</EM> DH5α strain to 
release Auto-Inducer-2, a signaling molecule. We do this so as to create a recombinant that
mimics many pathogenic bacterium that secrete quorum sensing molecules.</P><P>We will be using <EM>Lactococcus lactis</EM> NZ9000 strain as a receiver. It has a simple circuit to detect high and low cell density of pathogens and release the appropriate molecules. <EM>L. lactis</EM> activates the expression 
of Alyteserin-1a (anti-microbial peptide) at high cell density and NAly (neutralizing anit-microbila peptide) 
at low cell density. The precise mechanism with the genes involved is explained below.</P><P>At low cell density, LuxP, LuxQ, LuxU receptor proteins act as kinases that results in the phosphorylation 
of LuxO (LuxO-P) that activates qrr1-5 sRNAs with the help of sigma54 RNAP subunit factor, qrr sRNAs degrade 
the mRNA of LuxR which has been found to activate and repress a number of gene when expressed in the cell.</P><P>While at high cell density, the same receptor proteins (LuxP, LuxQ, LuxU) acts as phosphatases which removes 
the phosphate from LuxO-P and this results into the higher expression of LuxR gene.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container-fluid" style="background-color:#458B74;width:100%;height:auto"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3" style="text-align:center"><H2 style="color:white;font-size:0.8em"><B>About Us</B></H2><P style="color:white;font-size:0.8em">We are a team of undergraduates from the Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras in iGEM 2015</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3" style="text-align:center"><H2 style="color:white;font-size:0.8em"><B>Follow us on</B></H2></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3" style="text-align:center"><H2 style="color:white;font-size:0.8em"><B>Location</B></H2><P style="color:white;font-size:0.8em">Department of Biotechnology, IIT Madras Sardar Patel Road, ChennaiPincode : 600036</P></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3" style="text-align:center"><H2 style="color:white;font-size:0.8em"><B>Contact Us</B></H2><P style="color:white;font-size:0.8em">Email: igemiitm2015@gmail.com
