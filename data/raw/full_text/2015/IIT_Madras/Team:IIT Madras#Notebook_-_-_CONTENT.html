</LI><LI>The structural features of Alyteserin-1a was analyzed carefully to design a novel peptide which could interact with it.</LI><LI>Pymol and Pepstr, an online tool, were used to generate a large number of peptide pdb structures of size 10-18 amino acid.</LI><LI>A software, ZDOCK, was used to assess the docking parameters of  Alyteserin-1a and novel peptide.</LI><LI>Best peforming peptide was chosen to test it's functionality in molecular dynamic simulation.</LI></UL><H2>June 1-7</H2><UL><LI>Molecul Dynamic Simulation started.</LI><LI>Made a catalog of all available materials.</LI><LI><EM>Lactococcus lactis</EM> strains, NZ9000 and MG1363, were collected from Prof. KBR's lab.</LI><LI>MD Simulations finished the proteins were found to interact favourably.</LI></UL><H2>June 8-14</H2><UL><LI>Started working on the design of genetic circuit.</LI><LI>One more MD Simulation was performed with the ionic solution of protein complex. MD Simultions showed that naly 
interacts favorably with Alyteserin forming a cavity of hydrophobic residues.</LI><LI>Sender is finalised to be <EM>E.Coli</EM> DH5Î±, which would constitutively synthesize the AI-2 signaling molecules.</LI><LI>Receiver is finalised to be <EM>Lactococcus lactis</EM> NZ9000, which would sense the AI-2 signaling molecules and would behave in the desired way.</LI></UL><H2>June 15-21</H2><UL><LI>Sequences were finalised for qr1-5 and HFQ.</LI><LI>Request to iGEM HQ to order extra parts for LuxS, LUXPQUO, Sigma 54, L. lactis constitutive promoter and HFQ.</LI><LI>MD simulation job in which both peptide were dis-oriented at intial condition was submitted.</LI><LI>Prepared SOC stock, stored at 4C for autoclaving the next day.</LI><LI>LB broth, and LB agar was prepared.
</LI><LI>Use of usp45 secretion tag for the secretion of both peptides Alyteserin-1a and NAly.</LI><LI>In biobrick BBa_K218006, the stop codon for LuxP and the start codon for LuxQ overlap by one base pair.</LI><LI>Chemical competent cell preparation and transformation over two days. The first transformed batch showed no colonies.</LI></UL><H2>June 22-28</H2><UL><LI>We started preparation of fresh competent cells. Instead of SOC media, we used only LB broth throughout.</LI><LI>Agar Stabs for 5 plasmids arrived. We streaked them on agar plates for plasmid isolation on the next day.</LI><LI>We checked the transformation efficiency using the transformation efficiency kit provided by iGEM. Transformation failed again.</LI><LI>First plasmid isolation failed with known errors.</LI></UL><H2>June 29 - July 5</H2><UL><LI>The sequence of all parts and primers to fix the problem in biobrick BBa_K218006 via site-directed mutagenesis, were designed and ordered to IDT.</LI><LI>Preparation of ultra-competent cells. Tranformation efficiency was found out to be overwhelming.</LI></UL><H2>Aug 10-16</H2><UL><LI>Plasmid isolation was performed for transformed colonies and other biobrickes which were ordered from iGEM.</LI><LI>Received the gBlocks and primers from IDT. This delay took a lot from us. :( </LI></UL><H2>Aug 17-23</H2><UL><LI>Started cloning the gBlocks from IDT. But failed. No overhangs at the 5' and 3' end of the gBlocks therefore we can not use our two RE site, EcoRI and PstI. A big mistake. </LI><LI>We wished to use the other two REs, XbaI and SpeI, but they would result in self ligation of plasmid backbone and formation of scar at the insert plus backbokne region. We relied on luck. </LI><LI>Started site-directed-mutagenesis for BBa_K218006. No success.</LI></UL><H2>Aug 24-30</H2><UL><LI>SDM was repeated 3 times on various possible parameters. Still no success. We gave up on this.</LI><LI>2-3 time cloning experiments were performed. No success.</LI></UL><H2>Sept 1-16</H2><UL><LI>3A assembly for Biobrick BBa_K622000 and BBa_K1033225</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
