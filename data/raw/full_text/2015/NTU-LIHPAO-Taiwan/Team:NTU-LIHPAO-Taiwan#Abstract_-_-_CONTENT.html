Therefore, we aim to target at the key signal of appetite suppression, Peptide YY, with the help of probiotic Lactobacillus casei as a vector, combining with the most potentially developing delivery drug for cellular uptake of various molecular cargo, Cell Penetrating Peptide (CPP). Ultimately, we expect to design a novelly oral peptide vector where Lactobacillus casei secreting CPP-PYY complex for appetite suppression.</P><P class="subtitle">Introduction:</P><P>Peptide YY (PYY) is a protein that suppresses appetite, with the amino acid sequence both beginning and ending with tyrosine (Y), shown as follows:</P><P>YPIKPEAPGEDASPEELNRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY</P><P>As a gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, PYY is released for circulation after meals mainly from the L cells of jejunum ileum and colon. Upon reaching hypothalamus by circulation, PYY binds to neuropeptide Y receptor (NPY receptor) in the ventromedial nuclei, which gives fullness feelings.</P><P>Cell penetrating peptide (CPP) is a short peptide that is able to bring DNA or protein as cargo for spontaneous penetration through cell membrane, characterized by two mechanisms: Direct penetration and Endocytosis. They share 3 steps in common: membrane interaction, membrane permeation, and CPPs releasing into cytosol.</P><P>Our project design devotes to combining CPP and PYY, with Lactobacillus. casei as a vector, for constructing a dietary supplement for appetite suppression. The CPP-PYY complex secreted from L. casei can effectively pass through the intestine to increase PYY circulation, thus results in appetite inhibition and decrease in food intake, which serves as a cure for obesity.</P><P class="subtitle">Experiments:</P><P>There parts are being tested in E. coli for initial examination:</P><UL><LI>CPP-PYY complex production</LI><LI>Nisin selection</LI><LI>Suicide device for safety</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
