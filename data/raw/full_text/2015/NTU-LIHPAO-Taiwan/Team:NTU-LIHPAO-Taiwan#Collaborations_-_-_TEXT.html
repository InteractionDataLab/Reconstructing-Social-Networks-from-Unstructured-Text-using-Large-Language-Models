NCTU iGEM Conference
Three of our members joined the International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference at National Chiao Tung University from July 19th to 23rd 2015. As a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, it was an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology. And we received questions and precious suggestions from other participants after presentation and poster time, which turned out to better improve our project design :
Will L. casei secret too many CPP-PYY complexes and cause people unwilling to eat for a long term of time, which might cause malnutrition?
Will your product affect the sensitivity of hypothalamus to PYY? And is there a safety maximum concentration of PYY in blood?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
How long will your product stay in human body?
When should people take the capsule? Before or after meal? And how many times should people take the capsule a day?
How do you measure the concentration of PYY in blood?
Can gastrointestinal tract digest CPP-PYY complex before it gets through intestinal membrane?
Question from TCU: Why not use a patch instead?
Suggestion from ZJU-China:
(1) We suggest you change the suicide mechanism, because there’s only one promoter before the gene circuit of CPP-PYY and CI. This might cause L. casei die before it works.
(2) Will holin and endolysin in the suicide mechanism harm other cells? Why not change suicide mechanism into quorum sensing?
What is your product’s positioning? Is it used as food or as medicine?
As we know, L. casei is prokaryote. Can your CPP-PYY complex fold correctly through L. casei?
Will patients be hungrier after they stop taking capsule?
Will immune response arouse by CPP-PYY complex?
Is there any chance that plasmid transfer to other cells and affect the colony in intestine?
Is pLP825 too small for the three parts of genes to fit in?
We know that appetite is controlled by several chemical compounds, such as PYY and leptin. When the concentration of PYY in blood rises, will the concentration of leptin decrease? Will our body naturally balance out the effect from PYY?

Team HSNU-TAIPEI
We shared plasmid which we have prepared from Biobrick (BBa_B0015) with team HSNU-TAIPEI, and helped them with the restriction site design in DNA synthesis.
Mingdao
On 8/27 2015, we had a meeting with team Mingdao in Nation Taiwan University for improving the whole project and sharing the experience with each other.
