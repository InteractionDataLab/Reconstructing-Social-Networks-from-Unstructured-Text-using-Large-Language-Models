The iGEM Team NTU-LIHPAO-Taiwan 2015 had built a new biological system for the iGEM community. The original design of the system making up the (Product) contains the three elements listed below, in a probiotic – Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393.

nisI
Research from Torsten et al. revealed that the highest level of acquired nisin tolerance was achieved after coordinated expression of all four nisin immunity genes, containing nisI, nisF, nisE, and nisG. [1] Functional analyses provided evidence that NisI acts as a nisin-sequestering protein and that NisFEG acts as a nisin exporter that expels nisin molecules from the cytoplasmic membrane into the environment.

plac promoter
Lactose operon of Lactobacillus casei In Lactobacillus casei ATCC393 [pLZ15–], the lactose genes are grouped in a cluster transcribed as single operon. The cluster lacTEGF encodes an antiterminator protein (LacT), lactose-specific elements (LacE and LacF) of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and a phospho-β-galactosidase (LacG). The promoter region contains a cre element (catabolite responsive element) overlapping the –35 region, which is followed by a highly conserved sequence, the ribonucleic antiterminator (RAT) sequence, and a terminator structure.  The antiterminator activity of LacT is also negatively controlled by glucose, possibly by PTS-mediated phosphorylation as explained below. [2]

TAT-PYY
TAT can bring the big molecule substance like DNA, protein, peptide to penetrate the cell. Usually, named as protein transduction domain or membrane transduction domain, it is less than 40 amino acid. [3] PYY belongs to the gastrointestinal hormones. Once the intestine detects the nutrition, the epidermal cell, L cell of ileum and colon will secrete the PYY. While the blood pass the hypothalamus, PYY will bind to the neuropeptide Y receptor in ventromedial nuclei causing the sense of satiation. [4]
[Fig.2-3] Cell penetrating peptide + PYY
In this part, we use the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 to produce signal peptide-PYY-histidine fusion protein. With the His-tag, we can easily purify the signal peptide-PYY from other non-His-tag protein. This part is constructed to test the amount of the PYY that can secret out of the L. casei.
Test Part
RFP
[Fig.3-1] Suicide sense test
In this part, we use the RFP protein to testify the function of the lactose operon.
His-PYY
[Fig.3-2] PYY
In this part, we use the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 to produce histidine-PYY fusion protein. With the His-tag, we can easily purify the PYY from other non-His-tag protein. This part is constructed to test the amount of the PYY under the constitutive promoter in the L. casei.
Signal peptide-PYY-His
[Fig.3-3] Signal peptide + PYY
In this part, we use the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 to produce signal peptide-PYY-histidine fusion protein. With the His-tag, we can easily purify the signal peptide-PYY from other non-His-tag protein. This part is constructed to test the amount of the PYY that can secret out of the L. casei.
Y2R
[Fig.3-4] Y2R
In this part, we use the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 to produce Y2R. This part is constructed to verify the function of PYY.
