CPP-PYY complex for appetite suppression
Abstract:
As the problem of obesity is becoming a serious issue in Taiwan, more and more unverified weight loss pills are rampant on market. Therefore, we aim to target at the key signal of appetite suppression, Peptide YY, with the help of probiotic Lactobacillus casei as a vector, combining with the most potentially developing delivery drug for cellular uptake of various molecular cargo, Cell Penetrating Peptide (CPP). Ultimately, we expect to design a novelly oral peptide vector where Lactobacillus casei secreting CPP-PYY complex for appetite suppression.
Introduction:
Peptide YY (PYY) is a protein that suppresses appetite, with the amino acid sequence both beginning and ending with tyrosine (Y), shown as follows:
YPIKPEAPGEDASPEELNRYYASLRHYLNLVTRQRY
As a gastrointestinal (GI) hormones, PYY is released for circulation after meals mainly from the L cells of jejunum ileum and colon. Upon reaching hypothalamus by circulation, PYY binds to neuropeptide Y receptor (NPY receptor) in the ventromedial nuclei, which gives fullness feelings.
Cell penetrating peptide (CPP) is a short peptide that is able to bring DNA or protein as cargo for spontaneous penetration through cell membrane, characterized by two mechanisms: Direct penetration and Endocytosis. They share 3 steps in common: membrane interaction, membrane permeation, and CPPs releasing into cytosol.
Our project design devotes to combining CPP and PYY, with Lactobacillus. casei as a vector, for constructing a dietary supplement for appetite suppression. The CPP-PYY complex secreted from L. casei can effectively pass through the intestine to increase PYY circulation, thus results in appetite inhibition and decrease in food intake, which serves as a cure for obesity.
Experiments:
There parts are being tested in E. coli for initial examination:
CPP-PYY complex production
Nisin selection
Suicide device for safety
