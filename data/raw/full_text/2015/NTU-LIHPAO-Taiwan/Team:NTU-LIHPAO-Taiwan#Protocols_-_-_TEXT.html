DNA Dissolution
Materials and Reagents :
DNA (BioBricks/synthesized)

Procedure :
Add 10μL ddH2O

Pipet several times and transfer the DNA to an eppendorf
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Materials and Reagents :
Agarose
1X TAE
Tracking dye
Marker (1kb/100bp)
EtBr
ddH2O
Equipment :
Gel tray
Well comb
Electrophoresis tank
UV detector
Procedure :
Casting an Agarose Gel (m/v = 1.0% or 1.5%)
Measure out appropriate mass of agarose powder into a serum bottle
Add appropriate volume of 1X TAE
Let agarose solution cool down to acceptable temperature for bare hands
Pour the solution into a gel tray with the well comb in place, and push the bubbles away with a pipette tip
Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, until it has completely solidified
Loading Samples and Running the Gel
Place the gel as well as its tray into the electrophoresis tank containing 1X TAE
(Make sure that the surface is higher than the top of the gel and not overflow)
Mix the samples with tracking dye (1/10 V) sufficiently
Load the samples into the each well
Load marker (usually in the first and last lane)
Set an appropriate voltage (full/half) and run the gel for 15-20 minutes
Imaging the Gel
Put the gel into a container filled with 1X TAE and EtBr, staining for 5 minutes
Replace EtBr solution with water and destain for 3 minutes
Put the gel in an UV detector and record the result
Gel Extraction
Materials and Reagents :
Gel/PCR buffer
W1 buffer
Wash buffer
ddH2O
Equipment :
Cutter knife
Eppendorf
Vortex mixer
Dry bath incubator
DF Column & Collection tube
Mini Centrifuge
Microcentrifuge
Procedure :
Gel Dissociation
Excise the agarose gel slice containing relevant DNA fragments and remove any extra agarose to minimize the size of the gel slice (<300μL)
Transfer the gel slice to an eppendorf
Add 500μL Gel/PCR buffer to the sample and mix by vortex
Incubate at 60℃ for 10-15 minutes to ensure the gel slice has been completely dissolved (invert the tube every 2-3 minutes)
Cool the dissolved sample mixture to room temperature
DNA Binding
Place the DF Column in a 2mL Collection tube
Transfer 800μL of the sample mixture to the DF Column
Discard the flow-through and place the DF Column back in the Collection tube
(If the sample mixture is more than 800μL, repeat the DNA binding step)
Wash
Add 400μL W1 buffer into the DF Column
Spin down for approximately 20 seconds
Discard the flow-through and place the DF Column back in the Collection tube
Add 600μL wash buffer (contains ethanol) into the DF Column
Let stand for 1 minute at room temperature
Spin down for approximately 30 seconds
Discard the flow-through and place the DF Column back in the Collection tube
Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 3 minutes to dry the column matrix
(Can be done twice)
Discard the flow-through
DNA Elution
Transfer the dried DF Column to a new eppendorf (cap cut)
Add 30μL of 37℃ ddH2O into the center of the column matrix
Let stand for at least 2 minutes to ensure that ddH2O is completely absorbed
Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes to elute the purified DNA
Re-add the subnatant into the center of the column matrix
Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes to elute the purified DNA
