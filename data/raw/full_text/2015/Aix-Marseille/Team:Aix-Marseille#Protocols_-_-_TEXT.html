Preparation of competent bacteria cells
Make a culture of your bacteria in LB medium and let it grow until bacteria are in exponential phase  (OD600 = 0.5).
Cells are cold centrifuge 10 min at 3500 rpm.
The pellet is slowly suspended in 80 mL of Tfb1 buffer (300mM KOAc, 0.05M MnCl2, 0.1M KCl, 0.01M
CaCl2, 15% Glycerol (see next section “Preparation of Tbf1 and Tbf2 buffer”).
After another 5 min cold centrifugation at 3500 rpm, the pullet is suspended in 8 mL of Tbf2 Buffer
(0.01mM NaMOPS pH 7, 0.075M CaCl2, 0.01M KCl, 15% Glycerol)
Incubate 15 min in ice. Aliquot 200µL of cell suspension in sterile Eppendorf tubes. The cell
suspension is conserved at -80°C.

Cloning protocol for IDT sequences
The sequences are already prepared like BioBrick Assembly, they also have the prefixe and suffixe
This protocol is made to prepare the DNA, digest, ligate and transform it.
1- Resuspend gBlocks Gene fragment to a final concentration of 10 ng/µL in TE or AE  (elution buffer). The tube contain 1000 ng of gBlocks Gene fragment so you have to add  100µL of AE

Elute DNA
Place a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube below the column

Nanodrop measurement:
Add 2µL of buffer AE, close the machine and open it again, then clean up and down with paper.
Add 2µL of buffer AE, close and mesure for the blank, then clean up and down with paper.
Add 2µL of your sample and close it. Don’t forget to note your concentration !
Clean your sample with paper, then clean up and down with AE
Don’t put your finger on the paper when you are cleaning, you could contaminate the sample with YOUR DNA !
