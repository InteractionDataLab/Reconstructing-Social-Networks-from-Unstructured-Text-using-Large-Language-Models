The cytochrome complex, or cyt c is a small hemeprotein found in association with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. It is interesting because unlike other cytochromes, cytochrome c is highly soluble (100g/L). It is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction. It transfers electrons in the electron transport chain (between complex III and IV), where it is indispensable. 
More than its biological functions, cytochrome c can catalyse several reactions such as hydroxylation and aromatic oxidation, and shows peroxidase activity by oxidation of various electron donors such as 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS).</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV align="center"><H3 class="title wow Hinge">2-How does the cytochrome C work in our project?</H3></DIV><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">In our project, we hypothesized that the cytochrome c is important to degrade the chewing-gum. It contains a heme with a central iron, which is first light excited and then oxidised by the laccase. Then, a series of oxidation/reduction reactions will lead to the degradation of the main compounds of the chewing-gum: cis-1,4-polyisoprene, trans-1,4-polyisoprene and poly-styrene-butadiene.<DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">Why do we choose the laccase/cytochrome c couple? <DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">3 conditions make the laccase able to oxidise the cytochrome:<UL><LI>1-The correct distance between redox centres of the laccase and the cytochrome</LI><LI>2-The right orientation of both proteins</LI><LI>3-The consistent redox potential difference (ΔE) between donor and acceptor</LI><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 left"><DIV align="center"><H3 class="title wow Hinge">3-What are our constructions</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></UL></SPAN></DIV><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">

We decided to use 3 different cytochromes c. First, we chose the cytochrome c of <I>Escherichia coli</I> because we worked with <I>E.coli</I> strains. Then, we chose the cytochrome c of <I>Shewanella oneidensis</I> because it can use other final electron acceptors than O2 that suggests a very efficient cytochrome c. Finally we worked with the cytochrome c of <I>Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</I>. Indeed, it is a photosynthetic bacterium capable of cellular respiration suggesting an efficient electron transfer. It is an interesting point in our strategy.
In each case, two types of construction have been done: a cytochrome c alone and a cytochrome c linked to a laccase. In both cases, we anticipated a problem to overcome. To be functional, a cytochrome c must integrate a heme into its structure. As we overexpressed the cytochrome C, we should overexpress simultaneously hemes. In this purpose, we chose to clone the heme A gene under the control of the T7 promotor (Bba_.......). This construction is carried by an independent plasmid.</SPAN></DIV></SPAN></DIV></SPAN></DIV><DIV align="center"><H3 class="title wow Hinge">Results</H3></DIV><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">•Genetic construction works well. T7 promotor has been put in the 5’extremity of the heme A encoding gene. Three tests showed that the right construction was obtained: Colony PCR with the expected length DNA amplification (1), E/P digestion with an expected length DNA (2) and sequencing results (3).</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 left"><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">

•Expression of heme A protein did not work. Under aerobic condition in BL21 strain, when induced by IPTG, the heme A protein is not produced.  Cell extracts of a non-induced and an induced culture were analysed by a SDS-PAGE colored by Coomassie-blue staining. It should be more rigorous to confirm this result doing a western-blot analyse with an anti-hemeA antibody. But we couldn’t do it because of a lack of time and lack of the antibody.</SPAN></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">To improve purification process, a 10-histidine tail (Bba_K525998) has been added in C-term extremity of the cytochrome c. During purification process, we used a nickel column. The 10-histidine-tag will be fixed to the column with a high affinity, and so the cytochrome c will be purified. A T7 (IPTG inducible) promotor (Bba_K525998) was put in the 5’extremity of the cytochrome C encoding gene in addition to the deletion of the codon stop.<DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">We decided to make a translational fusion between the cytochrome c and the laccase to statistically increase interaction between both proteins. The problem is that the laccase is transported by the TAT system and can’t use the SEC pathway, whereas the cytochrome c is transported by the SEC system. To be export together, laccase and cytochrome C have to take the TAT pathway. So we have to clone the sequence signal TAT instead of the sequence signal SEC. Then, we modified the secretion pathway of the cytochrome c from SEC to TAT system.<DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">
In this case, it has been shown previously that the cytochrome c could be transported by the TAT system but, in order to be correctly matured it must contain an extended CXXCH motif. This motif will be recognized by a yeast cytochrome c heme-lyase (CCHL), which will mature the cytochrome c. That is why we did constructions described below.<DIV align="center"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">•Cytochrome c + laccase
Unfortunately, we did not manage to get the whole construction.</SPAN></DIV></SPAN></DIV></SPAN></DIV></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 left"><DIV align="center"><H2 class="title wow Hinge">Purification of Cytochrom C</H2></DIV><DIV align="justify"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">   				
We produced the cytochrome C from <I>Shewanella oneidensis</I> using two constructions named 01-1202 (1) and 01-1202 (2).
After sonication, we analyzed cell extracts by SDS-PAGE gel 15% (Gel1) to determine the localisation of the cytochrome C: in the supernatant or in the cell pellet.
Note that we produced the cytochrome C under two different conditions: in an aerobic (Aero) or in an anaerobic (Anaero) condition.
As we can see, the cytochrome c is located in the cell pellet, more precisely in the cell membranes. This result suggests us that the cytochrome C is associated to or inserted in the membrane. We solubilized the cytochrome C with detergent (triton) overnight 3 times. 
We did mistakes such as using the wrong detergent, the wrong SDS-PAGE gel or a not effective bad sonication that did not break cells…)
Finally, we managed to analyze our western-blot. After solubilization, the cytochrome C is in low quantity in the cytoplasm and in the membrane extracts. We obtained more quantity in the solubilized membranes.</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV align="center"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New">   				
Unfortunately, we did not have anything after purification and we missed time to try again. 
But we know that we can produce it. Maybe if we had more time, we could purify it and then test it on polymers.</SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV align="center"><SPAN style="font-family:Courier New"> 
Why did it not work ?
Maybe it’s because we did not produce Heme A with our Cytochrom C.

When the cytochrome C is alone, we don’t observe oxidation (FIG.2, blue curve). When we add the laccase, the cytochrome C oxidizes as we can see a decreased absorbance at 550 nm (FIG.2, red curve).

2)	Usually, a laccase shows a blue color given by copper presence. Our purified <I>E.coli</I> laccase is not blue. Maybe the copper is absent. Ni-NTA column is known to remove metal from protein. We can hypothesis that the use of the Ni-NTA is not appropriate.
