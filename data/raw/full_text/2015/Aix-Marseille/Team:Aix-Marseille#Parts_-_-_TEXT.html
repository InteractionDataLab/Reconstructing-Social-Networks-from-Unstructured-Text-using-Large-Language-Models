New biobricks using existing ones
We use existing biobrick to create new biobricks we needed:
-T7 promoter with RBS (Bba_K525998) and optimized Laccase from T.Thermophilus (Bba_K863011), protein likely to be more thermostable by its origin. A tag 10xHis (Bba_K844000)is located to the end of the protein (Cterm) to enable its purification (BBa_K1601015)
-T7 promoter with RBS and optimized Laccase from T.Thermophilus, protein likely to be more thermostable by its origin. The stop codon has been deleted to facilitate a protein fusion (BBa_S05313)
New biobricks we designed
We use sequences whiche were not present in the biobrick registry to create new biobricks we needed:
-Cytochrome C Synechocystis sp (BBa_K1601001), a cyanobacteria that suggests a cytochrome c
-Cytochrome C of S.oneidensis (BBa_K1601000), a proteobacterium which can live in both environments with or without oxygen that suggests a cytochrome with high activity. The stop codon has been deleted to facilitate a protein fusion.
-Heme A from E.coli K12 (BBa_K1601002)that enables the heme overproduction
-Yeast signal CXXCH from Synechocystis sp responsible for the S.oneidensis CytC translocation into the periplasm using TAT system (BBa_S05319)
-Yeast signal CXXCH from Synechocystis sp responsible for the Synechocystis sp CytC translocation into the periplasm using TAT system (BBa_S05320)
Linkers we designed
We designed some linker to facilitate the meeting of the laccase and the cytochrom C
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) Laccase T.Thermophilus and CytC S.oneidensis (BBa_K1601008)
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) Laccase T.Thermophilus and CytC P.denitrificans (BBa_K1601011)
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) T.Thermophilus and CytC Synechocystis sp(BBa_K1601013)
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) Laccase E.coli and CytC P.denitrificans (BBa_K1601009)
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) Laccase E.coli and CytC Synechocystis sp (BBa_K1601010)
Rigid and structured linker designed to link (or connect) Laccase E.coli and CytC S.oneidensis(BBa_K1601012)
