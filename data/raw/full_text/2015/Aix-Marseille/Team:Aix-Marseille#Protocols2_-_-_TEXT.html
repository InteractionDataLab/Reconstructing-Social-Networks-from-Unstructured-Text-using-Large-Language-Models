Transformation
Plasmids transformation :
Add 20 ng of plasmid to 100 µL of competent cells thawed in ice
Incubate 30-45 min in ice
Thermal shock : put tubes in the Thermomixer at 42°C during 2 min
Incubate 5 min in ice
Add 900 µL of LB
Incubate 1 hour at 37°C with agitation
Spread 100 µL on LB limp (with antibiotic)
To make negative control, follow the same procedure but without add plasmids and spread 300 µL
Ligation transformation:
Add 20 ng of ligation’s product to 100 µL of competent cells thawed in ice
Incubate 30-45 min in ice
Thermal shock : put tubes in the Thermomixer at 42°C during 2 min
Incubate 5 min in ice
Add 900 µL of LB
Incubate 1 hour at 37°C with agitation
Centrifuge 5 min at 5000 rpm
Eliminate 850 µL of medium
Suspend the pellet
Spread 150 µL on LB limp (with antibiotic)
To make negative control, follow the same procedure but without add plasmids and spread 300 µL
Preparation of competent bacteria cells
Make a culture of your bacteria in LB medium and let it grow until bacteria are in exponential phase  (OD600 = 0.5).
Cells are cold centrifuge 10 min at 3500 rpm.
The pellet is slowly suspended in 80 mL of Tfb1 buffer (300mM KOAc, 0.05M MnCl2, 0.1M KCl, 0.01M
CaCl2, 15% Glycerol (see next section “Preparation of Tbf1 and Tbf2 buffer”).
After another 5 min cold centrifugation at 3500 rpm, the pullet is suspended in 8 mL of Tbf2 Buffer
(0.01mM NaMOPS pH 7, 0.075M CaCl2, 0.01M KCl, 15% Glycerol)
Incubate 15 min in ice. Aliquot 200µL of cell suspension in sterile Eppendorf tubes. The cell
suspension is conserved at -80°C.

Construction
For each construction the biobricks corresponding is RBS (B0034), GFP (E0040) and Terminator (B0010-B0012)
All the construction was introduced in the plasmid PSB1C3 and cloning in E.Coli DH5α
Cell culture
Day 1: Streak on plates clones containing constructions.
Day 2: Starters were prepared in 3 mL LB media. One colony of each construction was inoculated. We did biological triplicates.Starters were incubated during 16-18 hours at 300 rpm and 37°C with shaking.
Day 3: Measurement
TECAN
1)Calibration: Dilution of Atto488 in triplicates with PBS1X and LB
2) Preparation samples
  Each construction was biologically triplicate.
  OD of each sample was adjusted at 0.5 diluted into LB media (0.475< OD <0.525).
  200µl of each sample were put into a 96-wells plate.   A triplicate of the measure was also done for each biological triplicate.
3) Parameters
