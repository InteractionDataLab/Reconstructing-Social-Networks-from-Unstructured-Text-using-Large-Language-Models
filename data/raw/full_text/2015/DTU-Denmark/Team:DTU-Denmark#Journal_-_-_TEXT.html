Protocols
1% Agarose Gel
Needed materials: 100 ml TAE buffer, 1gr. agarose, ethidium bromide.
Mix 100 ml. TAE buffer with 1 gr. agarose powder, heat in microwave till the agarose is disolved, let it cool till it can be handled with bare hands, add 10 µl ethidium bromide. Then pour the mixture into a mold containing slots for wells, and let cool.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Set gel into electrophoresis chamber filled with 1X TAE buffer so the wells are covered. 
Mix 5 µl of your PCR reactions/sample with 1 µl 6X loading buffer.
Pipette 5 µl into each well, pour 2-3 µl ladder in some so the size can be seen.
Run at 140 V, for 30-40 min.
Chemocompetent cells
Chemo competens is a way of getting E. coli to be able to take up new DNA, since this cant be done naturally like B. subtilis, then chemocompetent cells have to be made.
Protocol can be found  here
Glycerol stock
Needed materials: a 40% glycerol solution, bacteria of your choice, cryo tubes.
Mix glycerol and bacteria 50/50 in a cryo tube and place in a -80 frezzer till needed.
Making plates
A lot of lab work requires plates in order to produce results, and often you need a special concentration, a unique antibiotic mixed into the plates or a different composition than what is available at the lab you are in. If that is the case, the plate needs to be made from scratch, or somewhat along the way.
Protocol can be found here .
Minimal media
For the experiments a minimal media designed for B. subtilis has been used. The plates have been made by following this protocol (for 1 liter).
Protocol can be found here .
Miniprep
In order to work with plasmids, then they needs to be purified and condensed, this is done bu minipreping the bacteria, and afterwards the concentration can be investigating using NanoDrop™.
Protocol can be found here .
Natural competent Bacillus subtilis 168
Bacillus can be made competent allowing an easy alteration of the genome and so wanted mutaions can be inserted, this is a unique way of investigateing new pathways.
Protocol can be found  here .
MAGE in Bacillus
Electrotoration of bacteria is used in order to introduce mutations in the lagging strand of the strain, this technique are used in order to incorporate wanted mutations in a strain of Bacillus subtilis 168.
Protocol can be found  here .
Preperation of Electro Competent Bacillus subtilis 168
Electro competent cells are used in our MAGE part of the project, so a batch of cells was prepared using the following protocol.
Protocol can be found  here
Lab Notebook
Expression of Tyrocidine
The lab book for expression of tyrocidine can be found here . 
Generation of oligo-competent B.subtilis strains
The lab book for the generation of oligo-competent strains can be found here .
Blood cell lysis
To approve a lab-on-a-disc concept as a screening device, the UV-vis abasobancee were measured  here . 
MAGE proof of concept

Biology of the Future
2015-09-14
Our team member Pernille spent an afternoon giving a presentation on cell factories and synthetic biology to 30 highschool students. She says: "Synthetic biology is all about being creative and use your imagination to design bio-solutions that can impact the world. For that exact reason, it is neccesary to discuss which ethical values tat should drive research". The highschool students had lots of questions and opinion for the discussion about ethics.
