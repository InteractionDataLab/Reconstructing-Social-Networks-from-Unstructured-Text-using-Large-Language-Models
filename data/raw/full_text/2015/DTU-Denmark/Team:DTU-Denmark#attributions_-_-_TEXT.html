The Team
The DTU iGEM Team 2015 is composed of a group of ten motivated DTU students dedicated to exploring and sharing their passion for science. The team includes both Bachelor and Master students with a diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Pharmaceutical engineering and Computer Sciences. Many of the team members are highly engaged in internationally recognized research groups, leading biotech companies or student organizations, where they have obtained valuable competences within science, programming, project management and communication.  Our team is unified by the shared goal of providing significant achievements within the field of synthetic biology.
The project officially started with an introductory iGEM meeting in January, facilitated by our supervisor Chris Workman. From then on our team met weekly with idea development until Mads and Pernille, came up with our project idea. Many months of project planning, fundraising, lab work and coding have lead to the product we now present for you. All laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
We would like to thank our advisors who assisted us during the whole project and have provided invaluable advice and feedback. We would also express our thanks to everyone else who has supported us over the course project! Thank you for your expertise, facilities and materials. A full list of attributions can be seen below.

Linas Kaminskas
MSc Computer Science and Engineering (2nd year)
Linas is our expert within software development and the only non-biologically related student in our iGEM team. As he likes challenges, he decided to understand some Synthetic Biology problems and find some solutions for it. Linas tired to bridge between Computational Sciences and Biology, by creating a software enabling an easy design of oligos that would change a specificity of NRPSs, and be easy in use within scientic environment.

Tobias Løvgren Madsen
MSc Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering (2nd year)
Tobias is a life-saver for most of the team members. He kept track of the fundraising, organises our social events, and designed our board to keep track of ongoing activites in the lab and on the project. Tobias also has the fantastic ability to always be happy and bring beers to event. When he went to China for month to study public communications, there was no Friday beer. Besides all the organisational work, Tobias studies Pharmacutical Design and Engineering, where he focusses on entrepenuership and project development.

Pernille Myers
MSc Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, honors (1st year)
Project leader/developer
Pernille has been the driving force and molecular biology expert behind the Synthesizer project. She has kept the team organized and on track in the laboratory with more than 4 years of work experience in industrial biotechnology. She has been constantly answering questions regarding the theory and practical knowledge from the bachelor and master's students alike. As a part of Biotech Academy at DTU she is in charge of our Human Practice Strategy and laboratory project for high school students. When Pernille is not in the lab...(very funny, she is always in the lab). She fancies  jogging and travelling. Her most memorable trip was living in California, where she did research for a biotech company, or perhaps when she was invited to the Noble Prize Award Ceremony because of her project on brown bananas.

Scott Myers
MSc Biotechnology (2nd year)
Scott is the team's protein chemist and the most exotic member of the team (he is from California). After his bachelor in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Davis, Scott got a job in protein chemistry at a Danish biotech company. After seven years, he decided to move to Denmark to pursue a master's in Biotechnology at DTU. Being the most thorough person in the laboratory, Scott is in charge of important experiments such as chromotography and characterization. He was also in charge of our BioBrick tutorial for the other Danish iGEM teams. Outside of school he enjoys soccer, ultimate, brewing beer, and more soccer.

Vilhelm Krarup Møller
BSc Biotechnology (2nd year)
 
Vilhelm is among the team members who have spent most of the time in the lab –he even brought his private coffee cup to university in summer. He always came up with new ideas to pursue as part of our Human Practice strategy and always knew what to discuss at our next meeting. Furthermore, he has contributed in the long process of making us an official Blue Dot project at DTU. He is planning to specialize in the field of bioinformatics and wants to do his thesis at the Center of Biological Sequence Analysis at DTU. When he takes a break from working on iGEM, he enjoys running and some more science.

Verena Volf
MSc Biotechnology (2nd year)
Verena is a hardworking team member always prepared to attend the next meeting! She has been in charge of practicalities way ahead of the rest of the team ensuring facilities for every situation. An example of her commitment is her attendence at the BioBusiness Summer School 2015 to get a wider perspective of our policy and practice. She has been actively involved into our scientific project work in the lab but also responsible for organizing the BioBricks tutorial and taking care of practicalities. In her free time she enjoys bouldering, jogging as well as traveling and learning Danish.

High School Students
Maja Hansen
Last year High School student
Maja is doing her last year of high school and finds biotechnology,
chemistry, math and sports very interesting. The iGEM project has made her aware of new possibilities and challenges of synthetic
biology and has introduced her into a lot of new techniques and
instruments.
Maja has been helping with Minipreps and colony PRCs for the past months.
When Maja is not in class, lab or at work, you can find her at soccer stadium where she spends a lot of hours doing tricks, dribbles, and headers.
Nicolai Jørgensen
High School student
Nikolaj is the youngest member of our team. He is currently doing his second year of High School, with a focus on Biotechnology and Math. He actively participated in the wet and dry lab activities. Besides helping in the lab with PCR, running gel electrophoresis and DNA purification, he supported fund-raising and wiki-design.
When Nikolai is not thinking about a better way of optimizing oligos for our MAGE protocol, he enjoys spending time with his friends. 
Thea Kongsted
Last year High School student
Thea is currently doing her last year of High School, with a focus on Biotechnology, Chemistry, Math and English. Her primary goal of participating in the project has been learning 'as much as she could'. By helping in the lab, she has had the opportunity to discover new methods, and gain confidence in applying methods with which she was already familiar.
When Thea is not in lessons or in the lab listening to the relentless sound of the nanodrop machine, she is either playing or listening to music with her friends.
