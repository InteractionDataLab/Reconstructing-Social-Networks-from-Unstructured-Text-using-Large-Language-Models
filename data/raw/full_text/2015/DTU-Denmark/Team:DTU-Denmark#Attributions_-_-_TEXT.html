It should be noted that all laboratory work and presented activities documented on this wiki were performed by our team members and the three high school students unless stated otherwise.
Initial project phase
Previous year’s iGEM team members Anne Sophie Laerke Hansen, Kristian Barrett and Kristian Jensen joined us during our first meetings, shared their experience and advice, and helped us how to get going with our idea generation by introducing us to brainstorming techniques.
Faculty members of DTU Systems Biology Professor Morten Sommer, Postdoc Kai Blin, Associate Professor​ Thomas Ostenfeld Larsen and Assistant Professor Rasmus John Normand Frandsen gave feedback on our initial ideas.
Professor Jan Madsen from DTU Informatics for advising us early in the project phase and for attending meetings where we discussed the NRPS oligo designer tool.
Members of Drug Resistance and Community Dynamics research group under Professor Morten Sommer. The group is working on MAGE in E. coli and we received a lot of inspiration and knowledge from the team.
Fundraiser Johannes Lundin Brockdorff gave feedback on running versions of our fund application drafts.
Head of Recruitment and Talent Development Malene Bonné Meyer facilitated the contact with the high school students and helped us with managing the budget.
Anne Degen and Dr. Barbara Di Ventura from Heidelberg. Barbara was so kind to put us in contact with Anne who send us a couple of their BioBricks from 2013 including an optimized synthetic variant of their NRP tagging system.
The Muchen 2012 team for their well-documented work through good protocols.
Deputy Head of Department, Head of Section Jan Madsen was a part of the brainstorm session and helping with questions concerning computing possibilities. He facilitated also our collaboration with Linas Kaminskas.
Human practice and BioBrick tutorial
Laborant Regina Schürmann kindly provided us laboratory facilities during the BioBrick workshop.
Kristian Davidsen was a great help during the BioBrick tutorial, helping both in the lab and answering questions concerning the tutorial.
Head of Communications Mette Haagen Marcussen introduced different communication channels and helped us to define a strategy for streamlining our outreach intiatives as well as choosing our target group.
Assistant Professor Martin Mose Bentzen adviced in the assessment of ethics considerations in the content of our project. 
A special thanks to Pablo Cuesta who participated actively as a member of the team until August. He contributed with the initial project phase and initiated the public outreach.
Laboratory support
Laboratory technician Marzanna Pulka-Amin introduced us to the laboratory equipment.
DTU Metabolomics Platform Group and Associate Professor Kristian Fog Nielsen allowed us to use their equipment for detection of compounds and for providing us with a tyrocidine standard.
PhD student Anne-Mette Meisner Hviid and PhD student Anne Egholm Pedersen were a great help during the entire lab work, by providing protocols, materials and advice.
Postdoc Christopher Phippen taught us how to extract our compounds from cells and introducted us in using HPLC/MS and MALDI-TOF. He also ran a lot of the samples and helped with data analysis.
PhD student Zacharias Brimnes Visby Damholt helped us in running a SDS-PAGE.
Charlotte Andersen, Noor Alwan and Simran Sidhu from Roskilde tekniske Gymnasium who helped with a part of the outreach targeting towards highschool students.
Bioinformatics and software
Postdoc Kai Blin helped us tremendously in improvment of our idea in the initial project phase. He suggested us to use Bacillus subtilis as a chassis and he was very helpful in answering to any question we had about NRPS modelling and antiSMASH.
Linas Kaminskas joined the team for a period to develop a NRPS oligo designer tool for recombineering. Unfortunately, the tool did not end up functioning.
Lab-on-a-disc concept
BluSense Diagnostics  provided us knowledge and tools about microfluidics and use of rotation disc technology. 
Postdoc Filippo Bosco and Postdoc Rober Burger who facilitated our collaboration.
Postdoc Marco Donolato who gave us an introduction into cell lysis on rotor discs and suggested method to detect cell lysis. 
Mattias Parmvi who incredibly helped and supervised within cell lysis assays, as well as in understanding, data analysis and discussion of plenty of results.  
Michael Creagh who introduced and explained manufacturing and a concept of microflow on discs.
 
Art and Design
Mads Møller Madsen from PF foto who took pictures of our team.
M.Sc.Eng Michael Schantz Klausen who helped with pictures for our wiki.
