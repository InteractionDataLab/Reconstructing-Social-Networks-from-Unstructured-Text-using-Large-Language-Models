Judging Form
Bronze - 6 x  
1. Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.  
 Yes, the official registration is listed on our  team page .​
2. Complete the Judging form.
​ Our Judging Form was completed the 18th of October.
3. Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki, and document the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
 You are allready on our wiki iGEM, plesase see Desciption  and  Submitted parts .
4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree in accordance to the 2015 poster guidelines.
​ We are looking forward and planning to attend the Gigant Jamboree in Boston, where we will present our project with a talk and a poster.
5. Clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. 
 The attributed work is stated under Team  and help from other parties are stated under Attributions .
6. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. You may also document a new application of a BioBrick part from a previous iGEM year, adding that documentation to the part's main page.
 Our BioBricks can be found in the section; Submitted Parts . These are now registered as BBa_K1716000  and BBa_K1716001 .
 
Silver - 3 x  
1. Validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device. This working part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6.
 This is found here  for BBa_K1716002.
2. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. This part must be different from the part you documented in Bronze medal criterion #6. (Submissions must adhere to  the iGEM Registry guidelines .)
 The BioBrick part is part of the Biosensor project in our Human Practice. It is registered as BBa_K1716002 .
3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. 
 This is demonstrated in our Human Practice, we addressed important questions of Ethics  and Safety .
 
Gold: - 3 x  
1. Choose one of these two options: (1) Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. OR (2) Demonstrate an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to your project (this typically involves educational, public engagement, and/or public perception activities; see the  Human Practices Hub  for information and examples of innovative activities from previous teams).
 The element of education is highly prominent in our Human Practice. The highlighting achievement is the initiated the project biosensor, located at the  Human Practice .
2. Help any registered iGEM team from a high-school, different track, another university, or institution in a significant way by, for example, mentoring a new team, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, modeling/simulating their system or helping validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem.
 We have helped the SDU Denmark, the UNIK Copenhagen, and the CU Boulder iGEM team. For more details, see Collaboration .
3. Improve the function OR characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team, or by your own team in in a previous year of iGEM), and enter this information in the part's page on the Registry. Please see the  Registry Contribution help page  for help on documenting a contribution to an existing part. This part must not come from your team's 2015 range of part numbers.
 This is described here with the characterization the xylose inducible promoter BBa_K733018.
4. Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project. Your prototype can derive from a previous project (that was not demonstrated to work) by your team or by another team. Show this system working under real-world conditions that you simulate in the lab. (Remember,  biological materials may not be taken outside the lab .)
 This project produced no prototypes.
