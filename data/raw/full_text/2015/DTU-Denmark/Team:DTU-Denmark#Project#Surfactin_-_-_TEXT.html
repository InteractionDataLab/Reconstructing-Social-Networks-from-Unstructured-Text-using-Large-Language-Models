Figure 1. Picture of surfactin
As a proof of concept, we tried to modify the surfactin synthase by substituting aspartic acid with aspargine using oligo mediated recombineering.
Experimental design
Surfactin (Figure 1) is a surfactant cyclic lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis. It is important for sporulation in B. subtilis [1]. The cyclic peptide of surfactin is produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). antiSMASH prediction of adenylation domain specificity corresponds to surfactant. The NRPS modules are divided out on three contigs (ctg1_353-5) with 3, 3, and 1 module, respectively (Figure 1).
The second module (or module 5) of surfactin synthetase is responsible for incorporation of aspartic acid. Using the Stachelhaus code the fewest changes on nucleotide level that would lead to a change in amino acid is Asp->Asn. Three different oligos with either a change or no change in wobble position of the Stachelhaus code and with different length were designed (Table 1), yielding different number of mismatches in the oligo.

Methods
Electrocompetent B. subtilisΔmutS::beta-neoR or ΔmutS::GP35-neoR  mutation was used.  Three oligoes were used for this experiment. The two showed in table 1 was used separately, and the streptomycin resisters oligo called B_sub_Mods0007.1mutationrpsL was used to select for the desired change. 100uL of cells was mixed with 5uL of the surfactine changing oligo and 0.5uL of an streptomycin resistance oligo was used in accordance with the protocol for electroporation.
Results
Oligo reecombineering competent strain (mutSΔ::GP35) was electroporated with Oligo_surf_Asp->Asn_1_l
and Oligo_surf_Asp->Asn_2_l from Table 1. After recovery of cells for 3 hours, dilutions were plated on LB agar plates containing 5.
