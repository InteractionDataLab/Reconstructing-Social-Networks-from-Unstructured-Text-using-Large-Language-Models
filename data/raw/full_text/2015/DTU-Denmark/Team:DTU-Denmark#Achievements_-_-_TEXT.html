We would be lying, if we stated everything worked the first time. We made hundreds of agar plates, replica plated thousands of plates, and we ran the same PCR many times before finding the right annealing temperature. But that being said, we have learned from our mistakes and  it has helped us connect as a team. We are therefore proud to say:
We established a platform for MAGE in Bacillus subtilis.
We engineered a NRPS using MAGE in Bacillus subtilis to make a new product.
We tested the first generation of our high throughput screening.
We improved characterization of a BioBrick and explored uses of inteins for production of short synthetic peptides.
