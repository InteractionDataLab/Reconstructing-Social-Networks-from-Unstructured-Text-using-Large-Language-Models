            A.K.A: KaiHigh School StudentPresidentThis been my second time participating in the iGem competition I am a 17-year-old student in fifth semester of junior high. Having the Japanese and Mexican Nationalities is what makes me unique. I am as an Asian has to be “naturally” (such a stereotype -_-) interested in science and technology, but besides that I am a really open minded and a happy person. That’s why I have the best of both sides of Mexico and Japan. I was really interested in the competition because I could learn more about a topic that I am passionate about and to experience such an international and intercultural event will make my world bigger than the really one. This year been the president of the team gave me an irreplaceable opportunity which opened my eyes and realize how difficult is to accomplish something, but not impossible.

            A.K.A: NuriHigh School StudentVice PresidentWhy fit in when you were made to stand out?” I am sure there is no better description of me than these Dr. Seuss' words. I am an 18-year old senior, who is passionate about life. Growing up, I have always been a very hyperactive girl: fond of music, people and science. I love dancing, singing, meeting new people and places, and of course learning how and why things work. This peculiar mashup has led me to learn invaluable lessons. I guess my biggest goal is to make the difference, create the change I have always looked for. Fortunately, I have found the opportunity to achieve it through GenetiX and iGEM: I believe science is what can turn things up.
I’ve studied at Tecnológico de Monterrey (Campus Ciudad de México) for almost three years now and I already think of it as my second home. Naturally, GenetiX has become my second family. My teammates have taught me far more than just science or teamwork. From them I have learnt the value of passion, dedication, responsibility and enthusiasm. I have enjoyed that science is not only about lab discoveries, but about what you do with them. This has been an extraordinary experience; one that is just beginning.

            A.K.A: NatHigh School StudentDesignI am 17 years old. I'm from Mexico City. I am currently in fifth semester of junior high at Tecnológico de Monterrey CCM. I've always been interested in issues directly related to design, image view and manual techniques. I have participated in my school groups contributing to the area of design and display, as well as in projects and logo contests  and images of representation.I'm in GenetiX, first because I love to contribute to the group with what I know related to design, also because I want to relate that, with the rest of the group to form a complete team and we'll structured in each of their areas. As well as learn not only in the areas in which each of ones are involved, I mean to learn as much chemistry, marketing, programming, research and very important area, where you involve human resources in which you involve values and the human practice within each of us with the help of all the members of our team.I like iGEM because it is a foundation that promotes beyond coexistence with our own equipment, to give everything to be the best, promotes the relationship between more teams involved in iGEM with the support of a feedback and learning by what you acquire here. Likewise iGEM urges teens to have a deep knowledge in science with the help of many other areas that complement each of the teams.

I am I GenetiX because I wanted to use my knowledge of my two favourite subjects in a project that could really change something for the people. Also languages are a hobby for me, I know Spanish, English, French, German, Arabic and I want to learn Japanese. I like iGEM because it involves many people from many countries that gather for one simple goal, making the world a better place. iGEM is the first step for me to make a change for the environment we all live in.

I’ve always liked science, especially Chemistry and Biology. The reason I joined GenetiX is because I want to learn more about these subjects, and because I think it is a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-life problems.  In iGEM, I find a great chance to experience the interaction between teams and to prove what GenetiX is capable of.

            A.K.A: TrianaHigh School StudentWet Lab I am 17 years old and I’m currently studying third semester at Tecnologico de Monterrey. Science, is something that have always deeply interest me, because it answers the most amazing and vital questions: from the tiniest subparticle, to the most titanic supernova. But what truly interest me within it, is the great potential that we have thrue science to change the world for better. The things that we have accomplished as a scientific community are just terrifically unbelievable and to think what we can accomplish in a few years, just thrills me. I think that both GenetiX and iGem are a great opportunity to start that change. Also, I participate in Models of United Nations (MUNs) I had been in over seven muns in the past three years both as delegate and as chair. My most beloved hobby is parliamentary debate, I I was primary founder of the Debate Club in Tecnologico de Monterrey and we are going to participate next November on “Panamericanos”. Everything that I do is focused on achieving that change, because I want that every time someone mentions the word “future” they don’t think about a mass of gray polluted injustice, but as a bright community full of opportunities and hope.

I am really passionate in science, and social impact action. I describe myself as a very creative, social and smart person. I am in Genetix because it is a group made for science and also have social activities to share and spread science. Its a place where I can be myself, and apport to share my knowledge to others. Also is a way to be in IGem, and develop my abilities to my future, due to the fact that I want to study biochemistry. This development is also useful to my school work. My future aspirations are to work on the scientific field and help the society by this way.

            A.K.A: RafaHigh School StudentWet Lab I am a 17 year old student cursing 3rd semester of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. The reason I joined GenetiX and iGem is because I’ve always been deeply fascinated with sciences, and the thought of being able to get involved in such an experience was enthralling and exciting. I find iGem to be a real challenge, as I like how the project is taken beyond the lab and always asks for a multidisciplinary effort to succeed. Overall, I think of this as a great opportunity to learn more about science, get involved more in the things I am the most passionate about, and start building up a path to fulfill my dream of studying and eventually researching in an area related to science.

            A.K.A: AlonzoHigh School StudentWet Lab I am 17 year old student coursing fifth semester of high school at Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico. The main reason I decided to become a member of Genetix was my love and interest for biology and related sciences. I really like the way that Genetix chose not only to focus on biological sciences, but become a multidisciplinary group that searches to help society and spread an overall awareness of science. In addition, I love the way that we can go further from our classes, and investigate on our own, gaining knowledge that can help in our future (given we study sciences later on) and becoming independent in the process. Finally, I love the fact that all members of the team are decided to help and improve  Genetix as a whole.

I am interested mainly in biological sciences and that is the main reason I chose to be in GenetiX. I really love this area of science and I believe iGem offers an amazingly wide range of experience to enjoy and learn from. Learning everyday not only from the project itself, but mostly from other team members has been one of the best rewards this experience has given me. I believe it is amazing how we are able to mix the practice of science with everything else the industry should involve at such a young age. We manage the project, as well as finances and important events. I especially appreciate those that allow contact with other people to inspire the great love and interest for science our team shares. GenetiX and iGem have given me great knowledge and experience, as well as a profound interest on our topic and the people involved.

I recently joined the Human Practices team in GenetiX because since middle school I have been very interested in chemistry and biology, it amazes me to study how we and everything that surrounds us behaves; plus I get to learn very interesting stuff, interact with many people and help others. But what I like most about GenetiX and the other iGem groups is that they actually do something, they make sure their projects are heard of, and change for good the world we live in. Often we hear how we are destroying our world, but come to think about how many people try to change that; that's why I think iGem and GenetiX are such a good opportunity, not just for us, but for all the people who want to improve things.

I was born and raised in Mexico City, where I started to develop my passion for sports, mostly for soccer and football and I've been able to play football for my high school for two years now. Another one of my passions is technology and my curiosity to learn more in this area is what made me want to join Genetix. I'm one of the developers of our wiki and webpage and I plan to keep learning more about computer science and science in general for many years. Genetix has really helped me develop skills for programming and made me a better person in general. I learned to meet new people, ideas, ans visions which became experiences that will help me in the future. I know that this group will keep growing bigger and bigger so future generations on our high school can learn all of what we've learned on the team, and one day make a great impact in the world.
