Travesuras
Date:
May 23th, 2015
Objectives:
-Spread the love for science among children and teenagers.
-Give kids a special opportunity to learn and have fun at the same time
Description:
“Travesuras” is an annual project that takes place in our campus to invite kids from a government reliant organization called DIF (System for the Integral Development of Families) to celebrate Children’s Day with them and, in our case, teach them about science and how fun it can be.s.
This year we prepared different experiments to perform with them. We taught them how fireworks are made by burning different elements, and how to extract DNA from a banana.
It was very special for us to meet and have fun with children who were extremely excited about being able to behave as scientists for one day. Each one of them got the opportunity to be part of a experiment and many of them told us how interested they were on becoming scientists.
We believe that part of our job as members of the scientific community is creating bonds between young people and our passion, showing them how they can achieve anything they want to if they are brave enough to fight for it.
Science is definitely one of the most important areas of development for our country and having little children get interested in learning more and understanding the world that surrounds them through science was a very gratifying experience for the whole team.
Díaz-Lombardo Hospital
Date:
April 25th, 2015
Objectives:
-Spread the love and fascination for science among little children.
-Celebrating Children’s Day!.
Description:
Sharing with people who need us is always a valuable experience. This time, we visited an ortho hospital for children. For a morning, we were able to get along with them, play, laugh a little bit, and even dance. We got to give them a little piece of us, by teaching them a bit of science: the importance of DNA, through a DNA isolating experiment. We are glad they had fun learning. The most surprising was that even parents seemed interested!
Advanced placement science groups
Date:
Summer 2015
Objectives:
-Help new students finding their passion for science and enjoying it through fun activities.
Description:
Our campus provides the opportunity of learning sciences in high level programs. This year, we were asked to support the chemistry teacher while inducing the new students to the world of science.
It is always great to learn about the fun side of science and we got to do that with this younger students. We prepared different classes to get to know the students, test their knowledge about science and teach them basic laboratory techniques.
This experience was a very good opportunity to understand the huge importance of science for other students and how they understand this specific area. We got to test our own knowledge and to again spread the love we feel for science, as this is one of our most important objectives as a team.
We learned a lot from the importance of feeling passionate about science and being able to learn in a dynamic and fun way. It is always important to test knowledge by sharing it with others and getting the opportunity to do that in our own community is always a privilege.
Presentation for new parents and students
Date:
August 2015
Objectives:
-Get people interested on the science projects that take place in our community.
Description:
Every year, new students enter our High School and it is important for us to explain what we do to them and get them interested, not only in the project itself, but also in the situation that takes place in our community.
This year, we were able to explain all the areas of our project to both new parents and students of our High School. This was a great way to attract new members of the group and create awareness of the issues that are currently taking place in Xochimilco.
It is always interesting to receive feedback about our project and this was a great opportunity to obtain it. Hearing what people have to say about our ideas and achievements and actually feeling that they admire and respect what we do is a great experience for the whole team.
Beakman Science Tournament
Date:
April 23th and 24th, 2015
Objectives:
-Promote science in our high school.
-Provide our peers the opportunity to participate in a national science contest in representation of our campus.
Description:
Science is often defined as something boring or repetitive, perception that was turned down by a genius we all know about: Beakman. This character has had a huge impact over the popular image of science, by placing it as something fascinating. Therefore, we thought that a great idea to promote science in our school was to bring everybody’s scientific idol himself to invite them to it. The event was a Science Olympiad in which the participants aimed to earn a place to represent our campus in the International Science Olympiad that Tecnológico de Monterrey hosts every year. At the end of the day, we had a conference and talk show with the crazy scientist that made everybody keen on what we do.
