Hi! Welcome to our Wiki
Our team is known as GenetiX, we are young at this competition been this year the second time that we are part of this amazing and wonderful event. As High scholars from the Tecnológico de Monterrey Campus Ciudad de México we are passionate about what we do, some are artists, some geeks, some nerds, some "normal" and some what ever they want to be. We all are full of energy, creativity and enough craziness to innovate though technology. There is no word to describe the group but this diversity makes us unique.
Our group does not just participate in the iGem competition but has it´s objective in promoting the science in the Mexican society with the goal to demonstrate that no mater what               if you work hard to accomplish it you can do it. We are grateful to welcome you to our Wiki where you can see our project and many other activities.                Never the less WELCOME!
PseudoColi: Denitrification & O2 Biosensor
Xochimilco, one of the most important aquatic systems in Mexico City, has a huge environmental and social importance. It is home to many endemic species, as well as the main economic drive of the southern area. Due to its historical background, it is considered World Heritage by UNESCO since 1987. Currently, it presents several pollution issues such as an excessive amount of nitrites and nitrates, which in turn causes an overpopulation of Nymphaea, and thus anoxic conditions. As a consequence, flora and fauna endemic to the lake are dying. Our biosystem will activate a denitrification pathway taken from Pseudomonas stutzeri whenever O2 levels in the water are sensed as critical, using an O2 promoter. This enhances water conditions by reducing NO-2 and NO-3 into N2, and therefore algae and water lilies. Successfully implementing our biosystem will lead to a better future for the biodiversity in Xochimilco.
