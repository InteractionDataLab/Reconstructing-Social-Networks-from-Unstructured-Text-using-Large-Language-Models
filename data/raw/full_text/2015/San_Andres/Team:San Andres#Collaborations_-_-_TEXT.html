Collaborations
So the project could be carried out we have the collaboration of two teams IGEM ( EmelinaU and  Hostos ), since we work together in the same laboratory and share some parts of our Biobricks. And the team UChile  assisted us with the workspaces at the end of the process.
Also we organize a meeting where he was the majority of Chilean IGEM teams together with the Coordinator of the latin teams, Ana Sifuentes.
