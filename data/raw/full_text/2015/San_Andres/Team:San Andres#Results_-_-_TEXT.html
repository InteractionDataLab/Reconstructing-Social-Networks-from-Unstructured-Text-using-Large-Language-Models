We currently have our final plasmid. In the graphic model we can visualize the promoter, the RBS, the enzyme KumaMax, the RFP and the terminator
.
These results are expected to occupy it in a drug for celiac disease. The plasmid that  we have built indicates that it is degrading gluten, but not if it is degraded completely. For this reason we are innovating ideas to add a circuit that will allow us in the future to get a method to detect and quantify the presence of gluten, which can also be checked via a commercial kit.
