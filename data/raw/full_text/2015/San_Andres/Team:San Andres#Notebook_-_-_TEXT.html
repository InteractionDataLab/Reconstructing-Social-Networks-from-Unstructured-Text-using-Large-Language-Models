This project was initiated in April of the year 2014 and in this time we have acquired new experiences like to know students from other schools and communes with our same interests, also with our same age range, which goes promoting inter-school knowledges. Also this project has served as a guide for the future, helping us to understand University life through various clases of the sience fields, as in the case of molecular biology, where it taught us the basics of this, which helped us to understand concepts like what is an plasmid?, and how use it, things which helped us to generate an idea of how to solve a problem. Then we learned various techniques from laboratories to handle the bacterias,stuff of laboratory, laboratory's machines and biobricks, essensial things for our work, and like that start own project, in this case about celiac disease.
 
Lab (2015)
         January: Cultivation of Biobricks, extraction plasmidial and double digestion.
 
         February: Preparation of methodologies and ligation of KumaMax with RFP.  
         March: Presentation of the project to CORFO.  
         May: Samples are lost. Restart procedures.   
         June: Double digestion and links which fail.  
         July: Apply plan of ligations.
 
         August: All failed again. Change in methodology for the assambly standar. Restart procedures.
   
 
        
September: Finally works the KMX - RFP ligation and the plasmid.
