Throughout the project we started to learn the fundamental principles of synthetic biology to get to work on our plasmid with which we want to see gluten degradation via the enzyme Kumamax. For this we going to insert in an e. coli the parts (Biobricks) needed to make our future bacteria can degrade gluten. The parts are:
Promoter (BBa_J23119 ) : Constitutive promoter (which works permanently) that is give in the relative fluorescence of these plasmids in the TG1 strain grown in LB medium.
RBS (BBa_K1084103) : Synthetic RBS with uplifting sequence
.
Vector: pSB1C3
Coding Region: KumaMax (BBa_K590087) : It degrades gluten, celiac disease leading cause. Enzyme generated by rational mutation for the active site of it. It was created by the team IGEM Washington 2011.
Reporter: RFP (BBa_J04450) : Red fluorescence protein.
Terminator (BBa_B0015) : Dual terminator consisting of the B0010 and B0012 parties. It serves to give greater efficiency in transcription
