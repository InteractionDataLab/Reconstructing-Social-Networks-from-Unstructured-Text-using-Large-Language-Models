Abstract
The celiac disease affects 1 in 265 people worldwide and 15% of population in Chile. This in an irreversible autoimmune disease in which due to the presence of genes HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 in those affected, the consumption of foods containing gluten (all fods derived from wheat, barley, rye, etc.) cause an inflammation in small intestine causing multiple effects in the organism (diarrhea, constipation, porr absorption, among others) significantly affecting their quatily of life.
Whereas the majority of the world food contains gluten, we propose a treatment for those who can't eat gluten, and can do so without problems. In detail, our project involves a system able to degrade gluten via the enzyme KumaMax and report the operation simultaneously with a red fluorescent protein. The foregoing, works in a genetically modified E. coli bacteria. With this project, in long run, we hope to improve the quality of life of all those reported with celiac disease. People who suffer from gluten intolerance have an adverse reaction to gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye products.
