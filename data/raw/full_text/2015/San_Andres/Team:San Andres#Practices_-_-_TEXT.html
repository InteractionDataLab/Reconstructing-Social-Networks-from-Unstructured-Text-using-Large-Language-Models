To let the community knowledge about our project, we have performed different activities, within them, the explanation to students from schools about synthetic biology and the realization of a home DNA extraction, occurred in November of last year at Picarquin.
On the other hand, Television Nacional de Chile was to interview us about that it is the project and record how we work in the laboratory. This was shown in an interview the day Sunday 31 of may of this year.
Also our project has been released through print media, such as "Las Ultimas Noticias" newspaper and magazine Maipú.
   
     
To be able to raise funds for our trip, we have performed different activities, including: musical events, toy sales, garden sales, zumba, raffles, etc. We also have the support of the Mayor in our commun, who spoke with us about of the importance of this project for us and the science world, besides of giving help.
