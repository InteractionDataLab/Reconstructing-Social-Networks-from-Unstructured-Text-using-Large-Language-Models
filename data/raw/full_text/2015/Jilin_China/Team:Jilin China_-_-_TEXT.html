Formaldehyde, as common contamination in daily life, is one of the most dangerous cancerogen in the world. The condition of formaldehyde pollution has alerted people. Thus, it is essential for everyone to detect and degrade formaldehyde right now. However, there is no simple and convenient way to detect and degrade formaldehyde. On the contrary, available methods are usually too complicated for the public with a great amount of drawbacks. For example, Spectrophotometry is limited by experiment conditions and Prices of chromatography equipment are usually high. So we want to design biobricks to solve this problem by using microorganism.
