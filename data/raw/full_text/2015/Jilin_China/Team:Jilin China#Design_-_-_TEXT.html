describtion
First, we adjusted prior vector by adding a gene called T7 RNA polymerase(Figure 2). Whatâ€™s more, we used pET vectors to express two key enzymes, and constructed such a vector(Figure 3).
Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.
