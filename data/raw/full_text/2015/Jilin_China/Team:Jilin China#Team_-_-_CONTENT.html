I am Lu Xiaotong, a senior student of Jilin University majoring in bio-pharmaceuticals. I am such a person longing for innovative idea and that is why I participate in IGEM competition with whole enthusiasm. It is the competition that provides me the opportunity of getting access to synthetic biology and a training of my ability of cooperation as well as communication.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page"><H2>Junru Li</H2><P>As an advisor of iGEM team of Jilin University, I feel glorious to work with our teachers and students. To be more exactly, when I shared my ideas and conducted experiments with others, I was totally charmed by the significance of this competition. Until this summer, I thought I just began to understand the meaning of teamwork and happiness of learning biology. At this moment, I cannot wait to fly to Boston and participate in Giant Jamboree. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page2"><H2>Jun Zhou </H2><P>I am in third year studying Biology who love reading and shopping. I enjoy being in a group of students from various backgrounds and yet share the same interest as them. iGEM creates an opportunity to explore scientific frontiers and cross disciplinary boundaries with our team members. Last year, I was also the member of our team, inspirational, this year we build a new team with other friends who also love challenging. We can learn something new from iGEM every day. My motto: Now or never.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page"><H2>Students Members </H2><H3>Xuerui Zeng</H3><P>I am Xuerui Zeng, a student who studies biology. I am so glad to be an IGEMer. It has been a fruitful journey and things learnt from iGEM will benefit for my future. I love reading interesting science fictions and watching BBC documentaries about those mysterious phenomenon. Of course, the classics of biology is my precious nutrients.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page2"><H3>Huimin Li </H3><P>I am Li Huimin, a junior majoring in biology. You can call me Daisy. I'm interested in the process of exploring. Biology is amazing and I want to learn more about it then use what I have learned to solve problems.  I enjoyed the iGEM 2015 project. Besides, I enjoy cooperating with teammates and I'm willing to make friends with iGEMers all over the world.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page"><H3>Ziyu Liu </H3><P>My name is Liu ziyu. I am a student in Jilin University. My hobbies are sports and reading. I like sports very much expecially basketball.  Igem work is something like basketball because both of them are a kind of teamwok. Ireally enjoy my time in Igem team Jilin China.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page2"><H3>Lingyuan Meng</H3><P>I am studying Chemistry at Jilin University. My passion is everything related to Chemistry and Biology. For me, joining JLU-iGEM is a great opportunity to explore scientific frontiers and cross disciplinary boundaries with a team of passionate undergraduates. And I love our team, my teammates and my advisors. They are awesome and enthusiastic about synthetic biology. I can learn something new from then every day. I really enjoy these days (though we are all quite busy).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page"><H3>Rongze Chen</H3><P>Rongze Chen is a lively boy. He likes biology. He is good at speaking. Sometimes roller skating is also a good choice. He is always listening to the music while studing. His motto: Just be smiling, no matter what happened.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page2"><H3>Licheng Wang</H3><P>
	Hi, I'm Licheng Wang, a junior who majors in physics and has a great interest in computer science.  Though my major is not biology, I'm curious about finding the secret of life.  Perhaps, this will help me understand the world better and make a great connection between different subjects.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page"><H3>Man Wang</H3><P>I really enjoy this journey in iGEM. Making new friends, playing and learning, so many great people and so many beautiful things make me fall in love with this journey.  As for my hobby, i like swimming, everything about Chinese traditional culture. Welcome to make friends with me.
