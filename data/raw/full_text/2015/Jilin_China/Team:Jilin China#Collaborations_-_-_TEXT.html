Improve the project of WHU-China in2014
Experiment background:
iGEM encourages  us to communicate and cooperate with other teams. We found that the project  conducted by Wuhan University (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2014 Project) last year was meaningful and of significance to  environment and human health. Unfortunately, they didn’t finish their project  successfully. Therefore, we analyze Wuhan University’s last project and make  some improvements this year. They are also willing to collaborate with us and have already sent us their pSB1C3 vector in their detection system (click here to see more details about  WHU-China 2015 Collaborations). We start our  project based on this part. 
Purpose:
After our confirming experiment, we found that the reason for their  failure is mainly because the hxlR promoter’s starting ability is too weak and  their system will do harm to the bacteria’s metabolic system. So we decided to  change the promoter in their cleaning system and we add T7 RNA polymerase gene  in the detection system. By doing this, we are  able to reduce the unnecessary expression in the cells and make the whole  system work well.
