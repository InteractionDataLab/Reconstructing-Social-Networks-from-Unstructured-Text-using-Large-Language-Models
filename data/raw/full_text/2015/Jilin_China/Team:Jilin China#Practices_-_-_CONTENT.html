CCIC in Peking University</STRONG></P><P>In this summer, our team members attended in CCiC(Central China iGEM Consortium) meeting, which is organized by Peking University School of Life Science. </P><P> All iGEM teams in China came here, shared ideas and presented their projects. We learned a lot from others and they also provided us some precious advices. For example, they taught us how to immobilize our constructed bacterias so it wonâ€™t cuase any biosafety problems. </P><P>I still remembered that we exchanged a piece of our pizza so we could eat different taste of it. We really enjoy this meeting and we hope every year there would be a sharing meeting like this in China! </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="size"><DIV class="team_page2"><P align="center"><STRONG>2.iGEM club---Light For Your Mind.</STRONG></P><P>To share ideas with people who have the same interest in synthetic biology, we set up a iGEM club named Light For Your Mind. Every week we will choose a theme, every club member  read literatures or something else about this theme. On every thursday, we will hold a party and share ideas about this topic. For example, as the picture below shows, one of the members was raising a question and the rest of us was talking about it. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV><P align="center"><STRONG>3.

Survey about formaldehyde</STRONG></P><P>In order to find how deep the pollution of formaldehyde affects people, our team made a survey and did a research in Changchun. The survey and details are as follows. </P></DIV><DIV><P><STRONG>Results:</STRONG> All the participants know formaldehyde and its harmfulness, but only 30 percent have examined the condition of harmful gases indoor. In spite of this, they all show interest in products that can detect and decrease the concentration of formaldehyde. The attitude towards price is showed in Figure 1. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
