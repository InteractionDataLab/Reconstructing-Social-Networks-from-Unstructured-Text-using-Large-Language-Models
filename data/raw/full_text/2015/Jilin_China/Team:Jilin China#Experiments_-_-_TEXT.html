Starting Ability of Promoter hxlR Detection
To verified the starting ability of Promoter hxlR, we constructed two vectors (Figure 1) (Figure 2), and then detected their conditions of protein expression. You can see the results below (Figure 3) (Figure 4).
Figure 1. Vector pSB1C3-hxlR-PADH.
Figure 2. Vector pSB1C3-hxlR-FDH.
Figure 3. Result of PADH Expression.
Figure 4. Result of FDH Expression.
As we can see, at the arrow, there are no obvious protein expression results. So we can draw a conclusion that the starting ability is too weak to express both proteins.
Result of Our Project
According to the description of our project, we have two vectors (Figure 5) (Figure 6). And we tested these vectors by PCR, the results are as follows (Figure 7) (Figure 8).

Figure 7. Result of Vector pSB1C3.
Fortunately, we made it!
