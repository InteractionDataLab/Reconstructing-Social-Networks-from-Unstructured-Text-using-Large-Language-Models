   We'd also like to extend thanks to all team  members who sacrificed their precious time in this project. When we conducted  our experiments , we encountered many difficulties but none of us ever lost our  passion nor did we give up. Like a family, we needed each other, to catch each  other when we falter, to encourage each other when we lose heart. There is no  denying that every team member works for our project with a deep and abiding  love all the way.
   At last,  we must show special gratitude to iGEM for holding this Giant Jamboree. You offer us  an opportunity to  communicate with friends from all over the world and we believe synthetic  biology will have a brilliant future.
