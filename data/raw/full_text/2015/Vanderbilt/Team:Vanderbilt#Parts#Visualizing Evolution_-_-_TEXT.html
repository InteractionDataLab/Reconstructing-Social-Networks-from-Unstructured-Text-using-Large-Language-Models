Part Collection Optimized RFPs Visualizing Evolution Repair Enzymes
As part of our efforts to build robust genetic circuits, we constructed several parts that can be integrated into circuit designs. The details for each can be found on the "Circuit" page of our project section.The part numbers and gene names for each are below:
K1673301 Bidirectional IPTG Promoter
K1673302 Bidirectional IPTG Promoter with Ampicilin Selection System
K1673303 2A Peptide (Mutation Optimized)
K1673304 umuDC UV-Inducible Promoter
K1673310 Optimized VERT Circuit
