Background Sequence Circuit Organism Nanopore Achievements
Sequence
Invented an innovative software tool for minimizing any gene’s susceptibility to mutation
Validated rapid spread of mutants in a genetically modified population by mathematical and empirical techniques
Experimentally validated decreased mutation in optimized sequences with
Multiple mutagen types (UV radiation, oxidation)
Multiple quantification protocols (Alkaline gel, plasmid conformation, PCR inhibition)
Established high expression of optimized sequences
Modeling and computational strategies for further improvements and expansion of software
Investigated potential for nanopore sequencing to become next-generation of ultra high-throughput DNA damage detection
Circuit
Introduced quantitative metric of expected evolutionary stability and computationally modeled simple circuits
Invented software tool to analyze circuit designs, calculate stability, and suggest modifications to improvements
Developed software for minimizing sequence homology between synthesized genes
Designed assay for quantifying the effect of lowering homology on rates of unwanted recombination
Constructed optimized circuit to demonstrate improved stability with VERT technique
Validated bidirectional promoter for use with an antibiotic system to select against promoter mutation
Organism
Verified modeling predictions about population growth with simulated mutant cells
Calculated the selective pressure against transgene expression by comparing experimental data with the Price equation
Cloned five exogenous DNA repair enzymes
Incorporated KIKO vector for genomic integration and simultaneous knock-out
Designed “Incorruptible Cell” that commits suicide instead of passing on mutations
