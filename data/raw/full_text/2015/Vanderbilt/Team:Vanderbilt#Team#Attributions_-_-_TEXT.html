Attributions
While Vanderbilt University's iGEM team is driven by its undergraduates, our work is indebted to the generosity of our mentors and gracious sponsors. Vanderbilt iGEM prides itself in being a team run by undergraduates, for undergraduates. All project design and data analysis, lab work and experimentation, fundraising and outreach, and all the other work done by the team was all preformed by undergraduate student volunteers. However outside companies, faculty and staff, institutions, and individuals all have made contributions that have been essential in our team's growth and success. We would like to take the time to specially thank each one of them in the space below.
Faculty Support
Dr. Kathy Friedman for serving as our team's primary faculty adviser, and always being available to discuss project ideas and to help troubleshoot our protocols.
Dr. Chrissy Morasco for assisting with the administrative responsibilities of the team and giving us opportunities to brainstorm ideas and collaborate with other students during our research.
Dr. Ian Macara for providing both laboratory spaces that our lab used over the year, along with allowing us access to equipment
Dr. Ethan Lee for hosting our research space next to his lab and providing equipment
Support From Other Researchers
Sam Budoff for teaching our lab how to use the Nanopore next-generation DNA sequencer and providing us with the equipment necessary to run samples on the Nanopore
Anthony Tharp for giving our team access to the equipment core
Macara Lab Members for welcoming the team and sharing their equipment with us
Project Attributions
We are proud to be able to say that all of our lab work was conducted by undergraduate team members, and that virtually all of our ideas originated from students on our team. The specific contributions of each member is broken down below:
