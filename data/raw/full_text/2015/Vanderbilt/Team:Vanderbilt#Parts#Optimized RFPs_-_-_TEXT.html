Optimized RFPs
While testing our system for lowering mutation rates, we relied heavily on fluorescent reporter genes with their sequences altered according to our optimization algorithm. These parts were made resistant to a variety of mutagen types, and placed in expression cassettes for studying rates of deleterious mutations in vivo.  The part numbers and their corresponding genes are listed below:
K1673010 Partially UV-Resistant RFP
K1673011 Constitutively Expressed Partially UV-Resistant RFP
K1673101 UV-Resistant RFP
K1673102 UV Mutation Optimized RFP, Improved Expression
K1673103 UV Mutation Maximizied RFP
K1673104 Oxidation-Resistant RFP
K1673110 IPTG Promoter Standard RFP
K1673111 IPTG Promoter UV-Resistant RFP
K1673112 IPTG Promoter UV-Resistant RFP, Improved Expression
K1673113 IPTG Promoter UV Mutation Maximized RFP
K1673114 IPTG Promoter Oxidation-Resistant RFP
K1673120 T7 Promoter Standard RFP
K1673121 T7 Promoter UV-Resistant RFP
K1673124 T7 Promoter Oxidation-Resistant RFP
