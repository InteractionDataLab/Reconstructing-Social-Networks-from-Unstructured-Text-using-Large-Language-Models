About the Team
The Vanderbilt iGEM team is made up of dedicated undergraduate students who have a passion for synthetic biology. We pride ourselves on being a independent research laboratory run by undergraduate students. In our lab, as long as you have a dash of creativity and a dedicated work ethic, then even as a student, you can take your ideas for biological inventions and make them into reality. It is a rare place where we as students can go all the way from the spark of an idea, to experimentation, to discovery.
Our membersâ€™ interests stretch from biological engineering to bioinformatics and biophysical modeling. We have come together this year as an interdisciplinary team, merging together ideas from the fields of biology, chemistry, computing, and mathematics, in order to develop the kind of innovative projects that are only possible with immersive collaborations.
Our team combines an interdisciplinary spirit with a desire to tackle the most difficult problems in biology. Each of us contributing our own expertise and interests,  we look for new ways to approach these problems. As our project this year embodies, we are not afraid to venture into the seemingly impossible, like the idea of using engineering to somehow fend off the process of DNA mutation and evolution. But the most important discoveries come from taking that leap of inspiration, and we as scientists and engineers at Vanderbilt iGEM are willing to take the chance to bring the field of synthetic biology one step farther.
