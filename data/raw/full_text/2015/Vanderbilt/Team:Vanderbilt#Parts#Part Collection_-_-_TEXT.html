Mutation-Optimized Part Collection
To help spread the use of our specially designed mutation-resistant genes, we generated a new part collection that contains optimized variants of ten of the most commonly used parts on the entire Registry of Standard Biological Parts. These part sequences were generated by performing an overall optimization, reducing the number of hotspots for multiple types of mutation by synonymous substitutions. The part numbers and their corresponding genes are listed below:
K1673401 Holin (Mutation Optimized)
K1673402 Endolysin (Mutation Optimized)
K1673403 AHL Autoinducer Synthetase (Mutation Optimized)
K1673404 cl Repressor (Mutation Optimized)
K1673405 luxR Repressor/Activator (Mutation Optimized)
K1673406 lasR Activator (Mutation Optimized)
K1673407 Tetracycline Repressor (Mutation Optimized)
K1673408 LacI Repressor (Mutation Optimized)
K1673409 Chloramphenicol AcetyltransferaseÂ (Mutation Optimized)
K1673410 GFP (Mutation Optimized)
K1673411 Laccase (Mutation Optimized)
