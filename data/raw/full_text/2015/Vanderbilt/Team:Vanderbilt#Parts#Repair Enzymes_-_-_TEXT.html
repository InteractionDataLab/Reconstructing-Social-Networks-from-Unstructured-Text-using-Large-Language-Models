Repair Enzymes
To build our genetically-engineered strain of bacteria with decreased susceptibility to mutation, we produced several parts for expression DNA repair enzymes. Each of these genes were themselves optimized by our software to have a minimal number of overall mutation hotspots. Included are enzymes for repairing UV-induced lesions, oxidative damage, and the enzymes necessary to construct our "incorruptible cell".  Part numbers and their corresponding genes for each are listed below:
K1673201 T4 Pyrimidine Dimer Glycosylase (Mutation Optimized)
K1673202 Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Mutation Optimized)
K1673203 S1 Nuclease (Overall Mutation Optimized)
K1673204 T7 Endonuclase (Mutation Optimized)
K1673205 T7 Endonuclease (Homology Optimized )
K1673213 IPTG Promoter Mutation Optimized S1 Nuclease
K1673214 IPTG Promoter Mutation Optimized T7 Endonuclease
K1673223 T7 Promoter Mutation Optimized S1 Nuclease
K1673224 T7 Promoter Mutation Optimized T7 Nuclease
