User Guide
A sequence to be optimized is input into the text field on the left hand pane of the GUI.  Under the two panes there are a number of knobs, sliders, and text input fields. Those user interfaces are used to change the weighting factors, mutability factors, and types of DNA hotspots to optimize for. Then a “GO!” button is pressed to initiate the algorithm. After the algorithms are finished running, an optimized sequence is presented in the right hand pane. This optimized sequence will have the hotspots to changed highlighted. When a hotspot is selected, additional information about why it was flagged by the algorithms will be displayed.
