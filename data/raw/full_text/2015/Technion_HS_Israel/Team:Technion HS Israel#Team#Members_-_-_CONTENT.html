Hey, my name is <FONT color="blue"><B>Chen</B></FONT>, I’m 17 years old. I’m the head of the project and a part of the modeling team. This project is an incredible opportunity for me to get experienced in the fascinating field of synthetic biology, and also taking part of an international competition.
I think I would rather be a bit shorter than taller. Short people gets a lot of advantages, like the ability to sneak into places and blend in crowds.

Hey, i’m <B>Tomer</B>, I’m 17 and I’m the head of the modeling team, i enjoy working with my friends on our project and learning new stuff in many fields through it.
my favorite scientist is albert einstein (who else?) and i really hope that someday i will make a change which is even 0.1% of what he did.
apart from that i like hiking, reading and listening to music (favorite band- pink floyd) and rather be a giant rodent then tiny elephant because if people are afraid of small rodents, than giant one will be invincible…

Hey, my name is <B>Naseeb</B>, I am 17 years old , I am  the head of the cloning team on our project , I enjoy working in the lab and to work with different machines , but I don’t like to design primers by  the computer programs , I look forward to see the other teams' project and to learn more things from smart students in the competition .
I am happy to work on this project because I am learning new things in each day and I think that working with team is the best way to remove my knowledge, I am working with amazing students, and I am interested to be part of intentional competition.
I would rather change the past then see the future , because I want to fix some mistakes that I did in the past and then I will have better life , also if I will see the future I will care about something that not happened yet , and that will keep me thinking !!

Hello, my name is <B>Matar</B>, I’m 17 years old. In our project I’m mostly responsible for the wiki. The thing I enjoy most in our project is learning new stuff from my peers. I look forward to meeting new interesting people in the jamboree.
quote i find intriguing :<EM> “If you don’t have a plan, you become part of somebody else’s plan.” </EM>
― Terence McKenna
I would rather read minds then be invisible because I’m really curious to know how other people’s mind work.

Hi, my name is <B>Loai</B>, i’m 18 years old. In our project I worked on the cloning and also worked on designing the presentation and poster.
I like working in the lab with my team and feel like a real scientist, which was a very unique experience way beyond any other experience I had. I also like designing and making things beautiful.
I hate writing paragraphs especially ones that aren’t about science. I like machine engineering and inventing, also computers, robotics and this kind of stuff.My idols are Leonardo da Vince and Nikola Tesla because both are inventors that invented machines way ahead of their time and researched nature trying to satisfy their curiosity. I am looking forward to the jamboree and seeing what other teams worked on.

Hi, I’m <B>Vered Levi</B>, I’m 17 years old. I am a part of the modeling team, and I also helped Matar a little with the wiki. My favorite quote is:<EM> “A quote does not have to be intelligent, but when it is restated as a quote - it looks intelligent” </EM>(Vered Levi). I would rather be with someone I don’t like on a deserted island, because than I wouldn’t feel guilty for eating him when we ran out of food. I wish all teams good luck ☺</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
