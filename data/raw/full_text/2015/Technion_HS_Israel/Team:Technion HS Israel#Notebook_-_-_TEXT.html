Jul 5th to Jul 9th (2015)
Primers : OGEM 1 and 2 to open j09855 plasmid .
Gblock :RBS- Aiia with a Gibson overlabs.
we got j09855 part from the distribution kit.

June 12th to July 16th (2015)
Primers : OGEM 3 and 4 to got the k1767001 plasmid without LuxR , after doing the PCR we will get a linear DNA so we put two enzymes in the overlaps of the primers to close the plasmids.
PCR to open the j09855 plasmid.Gibson to add Aiia .

We got p0440 part from the distribution kit.
We built BBa_K1767002 and BBa_K1767004  Constructs by restriction enzymes.

Aug. 9th to Aug. 13th (2015)
Primers : OGEM 5 and 6 to check if we succeed in the PCR ( Those primers for colony PCR)
We got I13521 part from the distribution kit. We built BBa_K1767003 and BBa_K1767005 Constructs by restriction enzymes. Colony PCR to check if we have LuxR in the plasmid.

Aug. 30th to Sept. 9th (2015)
Primers: OGEM 9 and 10 to replaced the RFP with RFP ( with LVA )
We built BBa_K1767009 and BBa_K1767010  Constructs by restriction enzymes.Colony PCR to check if we have YFP in the plasmid.
