We would like to dedicate this page in order to thank the people without whom this project would have never been carried out the way it did. Our gratitude for you is way beyond what could be expressed.
Without further ado-
Dr. Orna Atar: Thank you for being our first mentor and teaching us all about synthetic biology.
Shira Attias: Our second mentor, thank you for your help in organizing the structure of our team.
Beate Kaufmann:  You found us in shambles, thanks to you we understand what we’re doing.  Thanks for the brilliant help, advice and guidance. For knowing and helping us understand how to make actual progress.
Assistant Prof. Roee Amit: Thank you for your advice and all the help we got from your lab.
The Technion’s collage team form 2014: Thank you for introducing us to iGEM and starting this whole process with us.
Karen Joseph: Thank you for your advice about the wiki.
Ittai Rubinstein‎‏‏:  In the few meetings we had with you we learnt so much about modelling and math, knowledge that broadened our minds far beyond the competition.
The Technion’s collage team form 2015: We wish to thank all of you for sharing your lab with us and for being there every time we had a question, and good luck to you in iGEM 2015
Special thanks are due to Dr. Orna Atar, Shira Attias and Ittai Rubinstein for the design of our main biobrick.
Last but not least, we wish to thank three wonderful ladies, for all the logistics and moral help along the way, for being there for us in the toughest moments, for caring about our best interest. Thank you, Tal Neeman, Dr. Ealeal Bear and Efrat Ziv Duvshani.
