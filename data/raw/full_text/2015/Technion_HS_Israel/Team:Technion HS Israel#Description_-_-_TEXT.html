Abstract
Genetically modified organisms, once released into nature, influence the natural diversity of the environment and raise concerns among the public. To reduce this risk, we strive to develop a time-controlled kill switch. By introducing a genetic circuit into E.coli we aim to tightly regulate the bacteria's lifetime according to initial conditions set by the user. We base the parameters for the biological characterization on a mathematical model that covers various aspects of our system, including plasmid loss. Furthermore, we develop a tool for simulation of biological circuits hence helping synthetic biologists worldwide setting up experiments. Given the large number of iGEM projects, we additionally develop a search engine for previous iGEM projects. By providing not only a time-controlled kill switch that deals with fears of the public, but also contributing helpful tools to the iGEM community, we are convinced that future scientists, such as ourselves, will benefit from our project.
Project Description
Landmines, rockets, aircrafts and data-storage devices are only some of the devices which uses self-destruct mechanism in order to prevent damage to population or environment. Much like those, genetically modified organisms pose a threat to the environment, and thus it makes sense to equip them with a similar mechanism. Our project suggests such mechanism which functions as analogy to starving or to battery running out- the organism starts off with specific amount of "food" – AHL – and uses it up as it fulfills its role. Once the AHL runs out- "no more food", or "battery is empty" the organism generates toxin (ccdB) which kills it. After specific amount of time, determined by the initial amount of AHL, the bacteria performs self-destruction preventing potential environmental damage.
