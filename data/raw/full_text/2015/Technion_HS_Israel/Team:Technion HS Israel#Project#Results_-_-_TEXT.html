Introduction and background
Overall introduction into designed kill switch:
We designed and built a kill switch mechanism that is based on the activation of a lethal gene downstream of an inducible promoter that is activated over time.
Genetically modified organisms, once released into nature, influence the natural diversity of the environment and raise concerns among the public. To reduce this risk, we strive to develop a time-controlled kill switch. By introducing a genetic circuit into E.coli we aim to tightly regulate the bacteria's lifetime according to initial conditions set by the user.
Our kill switch depends on critical acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) concentrations as constitutive expression of inactive LuxR (transcription factor; active form LuxR-AHL complex ) and AiiA (degrades AHL)  leads to expression of TetR (repressor protein) repressing ccdB expression (toxic gene) while the AHL concentration decreases over time. If AHL concentrations reach a threshold lower than 1 nM (based on our results), TetR expression stops and Ccdb is expressed causing the cell to die.

Background
AHLs (1), (N-acylhomoserine lactones), known as autoinducers (AIs), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. The conservation and potent activity of these signaling molecules is based on the lactone ring (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: General chemical structure of an N-acyl homoserine lactone
AiiA (1,2), is an enzyme that degrades N-acyl homoserine lactones. It comes from the bacteria Bacillus sp. 240B1. This AHL-lactonase catalyzes the following reaction hence inactivating the AHLs:
Figure 3: AiiA, an AHL lactonase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acylhomoserines, hence inactivating the potent lactone ring of AHL
LuxR (3),is a protein that can bind to AHL and form an active transcription factor. This LuxR-AHL complex binds to its cognate binding sites of the lux promoter (pLux) and stimulate transcription. The well studied operon of the pLux promoter is originally isolated from the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The following scheme shows the Lux operon mechanism (Figure 4).
Figure 4: schematic representation  for the action of the Lux operon (3).
TetR (4,5), is a repressor protein that inactivates the promotor tet (ptet) which is constitutively active, disabling transcription after being bound by the TetR protein.The tet operon derives from the bacteria Escherichia coli.
Ccdb (6,7), is a toxic protein, that interferes with the activity of DNA gyrase by forming a covalent GyrA-DNA complex that cannot be resolved, thus promoting breakage of plasmid and chromosomal DNA. CcdB comes from the ccd system on the Escherichia coli F plasmid, where it acts as a gyrase poison.
Characterization of first module
Design of BioBrick
In order to understand each module of our system, we started to test and characterize the first part of the genetic circuit. To do so, we built a BioBrick consisting of a constitutive promoter (BBa_I14032) driving expression of LuxR followed by a Lux promoter (BBa_R0062). The Lux promoter is inactive in absence of the AHL-LuxR complex and can be activated when AHL is present. Downstream of the pLux promoter we fused a gene encoding a florescent protein, in this case yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (see Figure 1A).
Figure 1A : BBa_1767010
This BioBrick (BBa_1767010) was used as a device that allows to
(1) determine the functionality of the promoter pLux.
(2) the formation of the active transcription factor LuxR in presence of AHL.
(3) compare to a similar BioBrick that contains AiiA (BBa_K1767009).
The BioBrick that does contain AiiA (LINK!!!), an AHL-inactivating enzyme, is expressed constitutively upstream of LuxR and degrades AHL hence the amount of AHL available for the formation of the active AHL-LuxR complex is limited. Decreasing active AHL-LuxR complexed leads to a reduced activation of the pLux promoter that should be observed in a reduced activation of YFP over time (Figure 1B).

Experimental Setup
In order to test and compare these BioBricks an overnight starter culture of E.coli harboring the plasmids BBa_K1767009 or BBa_K1767010, respectively were diluted in a low-growth, low-autofluorescence buffer (Bioassay buffer, BA; for 1l we added: 0.5 g Tryptone 0.3 ml Glycerol, 5.8 g NaCl, 50 ml 1M MgSo4, 1ml â€“ 10 x PBS and filled it up with 950 ml DDW). 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL, Sigma Aldrich (#K3007), herewith referred to as AHL) was added ranging from concentrations of 0.1 to 100000 nM and fluorescence measurements were taken every 30 minutes starting 120 min post-induction over range of 8-12 hours.
Results
As shown in Figure 2, fluorescence values of each timepoint were normalized by dividing fluorescence intensities by OD, averaged over a period of 90 min and 360 min, respectively, and plotted as a function of increasing inducer/AHL concentration.
