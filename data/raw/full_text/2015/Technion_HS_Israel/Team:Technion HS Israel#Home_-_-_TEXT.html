Innovative Autonomous
Kill Switch for Bacteria
We Are The Technion HS 2015 iGEM Team
Welcome to our wiki.
What We do
We design
a chain of reactions that ends with poison
Why should you care
Genetically Engineered Organisms (GMO)
Are quite common
in foods, medicines, industries...
GMOs can mutate and some people find it
Scary
that's why an Innovative Autonomous Kill Switch for Bacteria can come in handy
How we do it
Lab work
Modelling
Software
nice lab work bla bla bla
We describe different aspects of our system mathematically, including gene expression, plasmid loss and diffusion. We use to improve the design of our genetic circuit.
We build tools for the benefit of people interested in synthetic biology
