1 Notations
1.1 Notation principles
Every relevant substance in the cell is denoted with uppercase  letters which describes the substance, and a subscript which  encodes the scale in which the amount of the substance is  measured by the variable. For example, if we have a substance Y,
its amount inside a single cell is denoted by Yin
its amount inside all the cells together (its total amount    inside the cells) is denoted by Ysum
its amount outside all the cells (its external amount) is    denoted by Yout
2 A list of all the notations we used
Substances:
A  - AHL (The auto inducer, a short for N-Acyl homoserine  lactone).
L - LuxR (a transciptional activator protein)
LA - the complex LuxR and AHL form together.
LA2 - the dimer we get when two LuxR-AHL complexes bind  together.
aa - Aiia (a AHL-lactonase).
a1 - plasmids with an unactivated LuxR promotor.
a2 - plasmids with an activated LuxR promotor.
RNATetR - RNA strands of the TetR gene.
TetR - Tet Repressor protein we use.
b0 - plasmids with an unactivated Tet promotor.
b1 - plasmids with an activated Tet promotor.
RNAccdb - RNA strands of the ccdb gene.
ccbd - Toxin we use to kill the cell.
X - any gene we want to measure the amount of it that will be  produced by the bacteria colony. For example, it might represent  the amount of a certain drug the bacteria produce.
Other quantitie of interest:
N - number of bacteria. The bacteria are divided to two groups
   N+ - bacteria with our plasmid.
   N- - bacteria without our plasmid (in other words,  bacteria that lost the plasmids we introduced into them).
V - volume of the relevant scale. That means,
   Vout - the volume of the space outside the cells.
 
  Vsum - the volume of the total space inside all the cells.
w - width of the cell membrane.
Constants
C1 - C18 - different reaction constants.
T+ - plamid positive generation time.
T- - plamid free generation time.
p - the chance to loose a plasmid.
D- AHL diffusion constant.
3 Equations
Initial conditions
AHLout - how much AHL we put.
a0 - initial number of strands (probably plasmid number).
a1 - 0.
b0 - initial number of strands (probably plasmid number). Sounds  equal to a0(t=0) .
b1 - 0.
N+ - the number of cells we have at the beginning.
N- - 0.
all the rest - 0.
