Winnie-the-Pooh
Winnie-the-Pooh, also called Pooh Bear, is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne . The first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard .
The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard 's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list . [1]
Hyphens in the character's name were dropped by Disney when the company adapted the Pooh stories into a series of features that became one of its most successful franchises. In popular film adaptations, Pooh Bear has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway , Hal Smith , and Jim Cummings in English and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.
A live action adaptation of the film is currently in development with screenwriter Alex Ross Perry on board to write the screenplay. The story will focus on an adult Christopher Robin returning to the Hundred Acre Wood. [2]
Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie , a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo , and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario , Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear "Winnie" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg , Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there. [6] Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young .
In the first chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh , Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often called simply "Pooh":
