We enjoyed meeting with the team from Danziger High School. In the get-together we had, we shared  our knowledge in creating mathematical models.

As part of our human practice actions we organized an activity at the pre-academic center at the Technion for pre schoolers. We explained to them about synthetic biology and all of us had a wonderful time. In this activity we enjoyed hosting the Technion's collage team.
