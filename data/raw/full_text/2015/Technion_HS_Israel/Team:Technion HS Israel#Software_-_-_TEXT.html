Software Overview
Introduction
In this part of the site we present our software products. We believe that software tools can be useful for both analyzing a biological system and doing the preliminary research. Therefore we on one hand wrote a simulation program in MATLAB and a search engine and a constants database.
The iGEM Explorer
We have built a previous iGEM search engine, with the aim of being comprehensive, user friendly and useful. Read more here . Due to technical limitation on the iGEM server, we store the search engine on an external server. Link to the search engine: here .
The Constants Database
In order to make the constants that iGEM teams have collected over the years more accessible, we've created an automated constants database. You can play with it here . Its documentation available here .
The Simulation Program
This product is more about learning than about anything else. We've wrote from scratch a program in MATLAB to simulate our system numerically. It features a GUI we've written and in its core there is a numerical integrator algorithm we've written from scratch. The experience and the understanding we've gained are invaluable.
