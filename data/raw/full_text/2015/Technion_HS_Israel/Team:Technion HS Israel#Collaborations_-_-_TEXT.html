Collaborations
We planned and enjoyed a meet-up with the high school team from Danziger High School in Israel. In the get-together, which took place at the technion in Haifa, we shared  our knowledge and experience as a high school team in the iGEM competition and held a workshop for the Danziger team about basic modeling designs and how to create mathematical models.

As part of our human practice,  we organized an activity at the pre-academic center at the Technion for children in primary schools. We taught them about synthetic biology and all of us had a wonderful time. This activity we enjoyed hosting together with the Technion's collage team.
