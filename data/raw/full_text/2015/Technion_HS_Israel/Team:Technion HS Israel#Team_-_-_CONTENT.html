Hey, my name is <B><FONT color="#8a2be2">Chen Mechel</FONT></B>, I’m 17 years old. I’m the head of the project and a part of the modeling team. This project is an incredible opportunity for me to experience in the fascinating field of synthetic biology. Furthermore it gives me the opportunity to take part of an international competition.

Hey, i’m <B><FONT color="#dc143c">Tomer</FONT></B>, I’m 17 and the head of the modeling team, I enjoy working with my friends on our project and learning new stuff in many fields through it.
My favorite scientist is albert einstein (who else?) and i really hope that someday I will make a change which is even 0.1% of what he did. Apart from that I like hiking, reading and listening to music (favorite band- Pink Floyd) and rather be a giant rodent then a tiny elephant because if people are afraid of small rodents, then a giant one will be invincible…

Hey, my name is <B><FONT color="#8b0000">Naseeb Saida</FONT></B>, I am 17 years old , I am  the head of the cloning team of our project. I enjoy working in the lab and using advanced technology.  I don’t like to design primers with computer programs. I look forward to see the other teams' project and to learn more things from smart students in the competition.
I am happy to work on this project because I am learning new things in each day and I think that working with team is the best way to improve my knowledge. I am working with amazing students, and I am interested in taking part of an intentional competition.</P><P style="margin-bottom:50px;">
Hello, my name is <B><FONT color="#ff0ac3">Matar Rosen</FONT></B>, I’m 17 years old. In our project I’m mostly responsible for the wiki. The thing I enjoy most in our project is learning new stuff from my peers and our instructors. I look forward to meeting new interesting people in the jamboree.

I would rather read minds then be invisible because I’m really curious to know how other people’s mind work.</P><P style="margin-bottom:50px;">
Hi, my name is <B><FONT color="#ff8c00">Loai Absawy</FONT></B>, I’m 18 years old. In our project I worked on the cloning and also worked on designing the presentation and poster.
I like working in the lab with my team it makes me feel like a real scientist. iGEM is a very unique experience way beyond any other experience I had.
I hate writing paragraphs especially ones that aren’t about science. I like machine engineering and inventing, computers, and robotics. My idols are Leonardo da Vince and Nikola Tesla because both are inventors that invented machines way ahead of their time and researched nature trying to satisfy their curiosity. I am looking forward to the jamboree and seeing what other teams worked on.

Hey, I’m <B><FONT color="#1e90ff">Fady Bader</FONT></B>and I’m 17 year old ,I’m part of the cloning team in our project, I definitely enjoy our work in lab, it's fun and interesting in the same time. I have learned many new things in this project,  and I'm looking forward to learn more. I'm also excited to meet interesting people in this competition with the same interests, and I hope our team returns home with a smile on its face from the wonderful experience and results :).

Hi, I’m <B><FONT color="#daa520">Vered Levi</FONT></B>, I’m 17 years old. I am a part of the modeling team, and I also helped Matar a little with the Wiki. My favorite quote is:<EM> “A quote does not have to be intelligent, but when it is restated as a quote - it looks intelligent” </EM>(Vered Levi). I would rather be with someone I don’t like on a deserted island, because than I wouldn’t feel guilty for eating him when we ran out of food. I wish all teams good luck, &amp;#9786 especially us;

Hi, my name is <B><FONT color="#800000">Joseph Mouallem</FONT></B>, I'm 18 years old. In our project I worked on the cloning and also helped Loai a little bit in designing the presentation and poster. I enjoy working in the lab, it makes me feel like a real scientist, specially when we think about the whole project all the way from the beginning. Despite of all the things that I enjoyed doing in the project there still some things that I didn't like during our work In the lab, these things can be summarized with two basic items, the first is waiting long time between one experiment and the one after, the second is having unwanted results after a very hard work.
I look forward in the competition to meet the other teams and their interesting projects, in addition, I'm so curious to learn from their discoveries through their project.
I'm sure that all of us will enjoy the IGEM conference in Boston and I wish everybody good luck, especially us.

Hey, my name is <B><FONT color="#0000ff">Ido</FONT></B> and I’m 18 years old. I’m a member of the modeling team. I was responsible for making our mathematical model, together with the other modeling team members. I also developed our search engine “iGem Explorer” together with Itay, Tomer and Chen. In the “iGem Explorer” subproject I was responsible of doing the UI of the search engine.
I love learning and doing math, and I also love to program. I had the amazing opportunity to combine both of these loves in our project. I’m so grateful that I was able to participate in this project, because I learned a LOT about modeling and software development and because I also  learned about working together with other people on the same mission.

Hey there! I’m <B><FONT color="#ED9B80">Itay</FONT></B> and I’m from Israel. I’m 17 years old. I’m doing all kinds of things for the team but especially modelling and programming. My scientific idol is Richard Feynman. This competition exposed me to many fields that I’ve never had the chance to encounter before, especially to synthetic biology.

Hey, my name is <B><FONT color="#0099ff">Beate</FONT></B> and I am a PhD student in the lab of Roee Amit and the supervisor of the first iGEM high school team of the Technion. Coming originally from Germany, I received my training for an MSc equivalent diploma in Biotechnology, Biochemistry and Genetics at both the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg (Germany) and University of Almería (Spain). During my participation as a student of the Freiburg iGEM team in 2010 and supervisor of the Freiburg team 2013, I gained insight into the fascinating world of Synthetic Biology and I am happy to help and advice the students of this team with my experience in iGEM and Syn Bio.</P><P> I’m <B><FONT color="#006699">Alexey Tomsov</FONT></B>, I'm 25 year old, born in Minsk, Belarus and raised in a small Israeli Town.
