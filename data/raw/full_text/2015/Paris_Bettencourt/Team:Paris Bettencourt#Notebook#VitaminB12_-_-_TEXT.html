July 28th
Received Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii CIRM BIA1 from the INRA Rennes CIRM collection.
Made the following media:
MEA (waking lyophilized bacteria up), 1 L
Product
Quantity
BHI broth
37 g
Soja peptone
5 g
Yeast extract
5 g
Glucose
3 g
Water
Fill to 1 L
YEL (propionibacteria growth medium), 1 L
Product
Quantity
Sodium lactate (60% syrup)
21.4 g
Tryptone
10 g
Yeast extract
10 g
K2HPO4, 3 H2O
328 mg
MnSO4, H2O
56 mg
Water
Fill to 1 L
Successfully grew P. freudenreichii in MEA at 30°C, in aerobic conditions.
Made a glycerol stock of it: g15.53.
July 30th
Figure 1: Result of the growth of different strains on different media.
Tested the YEL+agar medium with the following strains:
P. freudenreichii
Lactobacillus lactis
E. coli
Lactobacillus plantarum
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Result (after 24 hours): figure 1.
August 3rd
Plated from the original P. freudenreichii glycerol stock on MEA. Did not grow.
For now, propioni grows only in MEA liquid (does not grow on MEA+agar nor YEL+agar
.
August 15th
Successfully grew P. freudenreichii in MEA liquid and YEL liquid
It seemed to grow much faster. Do I have a contanimation? Need to check.
August 16th
Made a gram coloration to assess whether the strain I have is gram positive, as P. freudenreichii.
They seemed purple (as Gram positive bacteria).
Need further checking.
August 17th
Tried to extract the genomic DNA to sequence the 16s rRNA.
Problem: followed only the short sheet in the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue extraction kit , which was not made for gram-positive bacteria.
No DNA extracted at all.
August 27th
Re-used the kit , this time adding lysozyme (10 mg/ml) to degrade the cell wall, but still no DNA out of the extraction.
August 31st
Made enzymatic lysis buffer for the Qiagen kit :
Product
20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0
2 mM sodium EDTA
1.2% Triton X-100
Immediately before use, add lysozyme to 20 mg/ml
Unfortunately we did not have Tris (> 20 mM) nor EDTA (> 2 mM). Instead we used a solution of Tris 10 mM and EDTA 1 mM.
Followed the rest of the protocol , starting with 1 ml and 0.5 ml of overnight culture of P. freudenreichii.
Very low (null) results:
Start volume
DNA extracted
1 ml
4.6 ng/μl
0.5 ml
2.2 ng/μl
September 1st
Figure 2: Gel result of the 16S rRNA PCR.
Lane 10: PCR on the 10 ng/μl of extracted DNA, Lane 5: PCR on the 5 ng/μl of extracted DNA, +: positive control that should have worked.
Made a 1 M Tris solution, adjusted the pH to 8.3
Remade an enzymatic lysis buffer, with the right reagents this time.
Tried again the DNeasy extraction kit . Got the following yield:
Start volume
DNA extracted
1 ml
10.3 ng/μl
0.5 ml
5.2 ng/μl
The yield is better, will try a PCR on it.
Made a PCR following this protocol and using the following primers:
Name
Sequence
16s universal primer 27F
AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG
16s universal primer 1492R
CGG TTA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT
Result on Figure 2.
The Mastermix was probably not working.
September 8th
Figure 3: Gel result of the 16S PCR. "-" lane:Negative control, "x" lane:PCR on the 10 ng/μl.
Tried again a PCR with the same primers, but a new mastermix.
Result: figure 3. It worked!
