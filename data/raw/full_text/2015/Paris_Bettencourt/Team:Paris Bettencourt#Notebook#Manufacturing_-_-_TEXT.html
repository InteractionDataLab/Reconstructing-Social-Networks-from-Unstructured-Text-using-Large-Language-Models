Beginning of the manufacturing project! Let's do it!
Goal
The goal of this project is to create an way to grow and distribute our strains in India, easily and for cheap.
Since our genetically engineered strains will be ready only in september, we will not have time to work on it, so we have to find similar strains, that we can study and select with antibiotics.
We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae  mcherry, wich is resistant to geneticin at a concentration of 200µg/mL, and produce RFP. Therefore, it's easy to select and characterize it.
Basically, we are going to try different ways to distribute the strains and see how well they survived for each process.
In order to do that, we will have to calculate a survival rate so we have to be able to know how many cells we are putting in the beggining, in the recipe we are trying.
Material
Glycerol stock of Sc. mcherry
YPD broth
Agar
Geneticin, 100mg/ml
Osmosed water
Sterile culture tubes
Sterile eppendorf tubes
Sterile plates and beads
Procedure
Make a culture of Sc. mcherry in 10ml of YPD media adding 20µL of geneticin
(We did cultures on the 25th of July)
Two days later, centrifuge the culture tube
Throw the media away and replace it by 10ml of osmosed water
Measure the OD, doing the blank with osmosed water
If the OD is too high to be measured, make a 10 times dilution and measure the OD of the dilution
In the eppendorf tubes, make 10-1 to 10-5 dilutions of the yeasts/water solution to plate them on YPDagar+GEN(200)
That is what we did today, and we plated the different dilutions, thanks to the beads.
July 28th
Goal
Our first idea to distribute the yeast was to simply dry them and collect the dry cells, without adding anything.
Today is a first try, to have an idea of how to do it.
Material
Culture of Sc. mcherry
YPD broth
Agar
Geneticin, 100mg/ml
Osmosed water
Sterile eppendorf tubes
Sterile plates and beads
Procedure
Centrifuge a culture tube
Throw the media away
Add 300µL of water to detach the yeasts from the tube easily
Spread on aluminium
Let it dry for 2 hours in the open air or in the incubator (2 different tests)
Scratch the aluminium to detach the dried yeasts
Put the powder in 10ml of osmosed water
Plate the solution to see if Sc. mcherry survived
Results and discussion
We obtained this powder:
We realised the aluminium was not a good idea:
The yeasts stick to it and it gets destroyed when we scratch.
We have to find another drying paper, more resistant.
July 29th
Result of the OD test made on the 27th of July:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,557.
100µL of the 10-4 dilution grew 359 colonies, so:
1 A = 1,4x107 cells/ml
We repeated the very same OD experiment today, for more repetitions.
July 30th
Results of the drying test made on the 28th of July:
Yeasts grew in the plate.
We can check that they produce RFP, it's Sc. mcherry who survived.
Procedure
Today, we are repeating the drying experiment (see July 28th) but drying the yeasts on a plastic dish.
Take 100µL of the culture solution of Sc. mcherry to make dilutions (10-1 to 10-5)
We remind that the culture tube contain 10ml of media.
Plate 100µL of each dilutions to deduce the number of cells in the culture tube
Centrifuge the culture tube
Throw the media away
Add 300µL of water to detach the yeasts from the tube easily
Spread on aluminium
Let it dry for 2 hours
Scratch the aluminium to detach the dried yeasts
Put the powder in 10ml of osmosed water
Take 100µL of the solution to make dilutions (10-1 to 10-5)
Thanks to the beads, plate 100µL of each dilution
July 31th
Result of the OD test made on the 29th of July:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,635.
100µL of the 10-4 dilution grew 205 colonies, so:
1 A = 7,8x106 cells/ml
August 1st
Result of the drying test made on the 30th of July:
100µL of the 10-5 dilution of the initial 10ml culture solution grew 106 colonies, so we initially dried 1,06x109 cells.
100µL of the 10-4 dilution of the powder mixed with 30ml of osmosed water grew 123 colonies, so 8,4x108 cells survived.
We therefore have a survival rate of 79%.
Discussion and New Goal
The powder we obtained with the drying method stick to everything, because of static electricity and therefore, it is not very easy to distribute and manipulate.
Consequently, we are looking fo other solutions...
Our second idea was to cook a homemade powder with edible ingredients easily found in India.
We found a recipe that inspired us here .
We decided to compare the initial recipe to our modifications, so we made for different tests :
Test 1, original recipe: wheat flour, sugar and ginger
Since the project is designed for rice fermentation and rice is cheaper than wheat, we wanted to try with rice flour.
Test 2: rice flour, sugar and ginger
Ginger can be expensive so maybe we can avoid using it...
Test 3: rice flour, sugar
And maybe we can also avoid using sugar
Test 4: only rice flour
Material
Culture of Sc. mcherry
Potatoes
Flour (wheat and rice)
Cornmeal
Sugar
Ginger
Plate of YPDagar+Gen(200)
Osmosed water
Sterile eppendorf tubes
Sterile beads
Procedure
Cook some potatoes
Save the cooking water, wait till it's not too hot and mix 20ml of it with the yeasts
Add 20ml of flour (rice or wheat depending on the recipe), 40ml of mashed potatoes
Depending on the recipe add 20ml of sugar and a teaspoon of ginger
Add 80ml of cornmeal
Let it dry for 1 day
Mill the paste to obtain a powder
Plate the powder obtained to see how many Sc. mcherry survived
August 3rd
Continuing the powder recipe we began on the 1st of August
After almost two days of drying, we obtained a very hard paste that we milled.
After milling, we had this nice yellow powder you can see on the picture.
We put 100mg of each powder in 10ml of osmosed water, made dilutions,
and plated the solutions in YPDagar+GEN(200) plates.
August 4th
Discussion and New Goal
While doing the recipe with the potatoes (from the 1st to the 3rd of August), we realised it wasn't easy to do and it took lots of time and ingredients.
We decided to reduce the number of ingredients, using only water and rice flour.
Procedure
Mix the yeasts with 20ml of osmosed water
Add 40ml of rice flour
Knead till you get a nice paste
At this point, we tought the paste could be shaped, instead of being milled in a powder.
Shape it in little cubes
Let it dry for few hours
Result
The result is a small solid cube, very easy to give away.
Several cubes can be packed together.
We tought it could be a good media of distribution.
We dissolved one cube in 10ml of osmosed water, after weighed it.
Then we made dilutions (10-1 to 10-5) and plated 100µL of each on YPDagar+GEN(200)
August 5th
Results of the survival of Sc. mcherry in the potato powder made on the 3rd of August:
Survival rate:
Wheat flour, sugar and ginger: 14%
Rice flour, sugar and ginger: 20%
Rice flour, sugar: 12%
Rice flour: 4%
Discussion:
We can see that the more ingredients we put, the more the yeasts survived, so each ingredient plays a role in the cells survival.
But as we said before, we don't want to put too much ingredients in the recipe so that it's cheap and easy.
We can also notice that rice flour seems more efficient than wheat flour (but we made only one repetition so nothing is statistically proven).
August 6th
Results of the survival of Sc. mcherry in the cubes made on the 4th of August:
We obtained a survival rate of 69%.
After staying 5hours in the water, the survival rate reached 737%.
August 7th
Goal
Now that we are at ease with the process, we are trying the very same process with lactococcus lactis. We chose MG 13.63, containing the plasmid PSIP411, resistant to erythromycin at a concentration of 10µL/mL, to study it's survival rate.
We will name this strain G1513.
We also have to correlate the OD of a solution of G1513 to the number of alive cells inside.
Material
Glycerol stock of G1513
M17 broth
Solution of D-Glucose
Agar
Erythromycin, 20mg/ml
Osmosed water
Sterile eppendorf tubes
Sterile plates and beads
Procedure
Make a culture of G1513 in 10ml of M17+1% glucose media adding 5µL of erythromycin
(We did cultures on the 6th of August)
One day later, centrifuge the culture tube
Throw the media away and replace it by 10ml of osmosed water
Measure the OD, doing the blank with osmosed water
If the OD is too high to be measured, make a 10 times dilution and measure the OD of the dilution
In the eppendorf tubes, make 10-1 to 10-5 dilutions of the G1513/water solution to plate 100µL of each on M17Glucose+agar+Ery(10)
August 10th
Results of the OD test for G1513 made on the 7th of August:
The 10ml solution of G1513/water had an OD of 1,296.
Here is a table of what 100µL of each dilutions grew:
Dilution
Number of colonies
10-1
381
10-2
84
10-3
11
We have, in average, 7,74x103 cells per ml of the 10-1 dilution.
so: 1 A = 6,0x104 cells/ml
Procedure
Today, we made new cubes containing Sc. mcherry and G1513 to calculate the survival rate.
August 11th
Goal
While waiting for the cubes results, we are thinking about the next step: finding a media to grow the strains, easy to give to the population and to use afterward.
The perfect media would be an edible one, that we could incorporate to the cube, instead of the water.
Material
Culture of Sc. mcherry
3 potatoes
Rice flour
Geneticin, 100mg/ml
Osmosed water
Sterile eppendorf tubes and culture tubes
Sterile plates and beads
One glass bottle
Procedure
We tried 2 different medium: potato juice and potato juice with rice flour.
For the potato juice:
Heat 3 potatoes in 750ml of water
Let the water boil (sterilisation)
Save the water and stock it in a bottle
Put 10ml of this potato water in a culture tube
Add 20μL of geneticin (100mg/ml)
Inoculate with Sc. mcherry
Put in the incubator at 30°C for 2 days
For the mix potato juice with rice flour:
Put 5ml of the potato water made previously in a culture tube
Inoculate with Sc. mcherry
Add 20μL of geneticin (100mg/ml)
Add 5ml of rice flour
Put in the incubator at 30°C for 2 days
August 12th
Results of the cube tests made on the 10th of August
The yeasts survived well: 42%.
(Seven days later, on the 19th of August, we plated cubes from this same test, and obtained a survival rate of 21%.)
But about the G1513, strangely, the number of cells in the plates of M17agar, which are supposed to be G1513,  is the same as in the plates with YPD and geneticin, selecting the yeasts.
Therefore, we checked the production of RFP, since Sc. mcherry produces RFP but not G1513.
Unfortunately, we came to the conclusion that the cells in the M17 plates were yeasts. Actually, Sc. mcherry resist to erythromycin and is therefore growing in the plate.
Goal
We need a chemical that will allow us to select G1513 and kill Sc. mcherry.
After some researchs, we found out that cycloheximide could be helpful and ordered it. While waiting for this chemical, we can't work with G1513.
August 13th
Results of the media test made on the 11th of August
Nothing grew on the potato juice media.
We had the idea of adding sugar, to see if it changes something.
The potato juice/rice flour media strongly smells yeasts. We therefore admit the yeast grew in this media but decided that the aspect wasn't very attractive and the smell so so bad that indian population would be disgusted and won't use it.
August 17th
Procedure
Making new cubes with Sc. mcherry alone, G1513 alone, and a mix of both strains.
Measuring the OD and plating to count the cells
Results of the media test made on the 13th of August
With sugar, we can see there are cells growing in the potato juice.
It's a very small growth compared to the one in YPD but it's still a growth.
We will work more precisely on this media, trying to deduce the influence of the potato and sugar concentration.
August 18th
Results of the OD test made on the 17th of August
For Sc. mcherry:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 1,820.
100µL of the 10-4 dilution grew 70 colonies, so:
1 A = 3,8x106 cells/ml
For G1513:
The 10ml solution of G1513/water had an OD of 1,521.
100µL of the dilutions grew:
Dilution
Number of colonies
10-5
131
10-6
21
So 1 A = 1,1x108 cells/ml
August 19th
Results of the cube test made on the 17th of August
Sc. mcherry alone: 39%
Sc. mcherry in the mix: 26%
G1513 in the mix: not plated because we are waiting for the cycloheximide
G1513 alone: 1,8%
We kept samples of the mix in the fridge to be able to study it later, when we will have the cycloheximide.
August 20th
Procedure
We made more cubes with Sc. mcherry alone, G1513 alone, and a mix of both.
We made more OD correlations.
August 24th
Procedure
We made more cubes...
Results of the OD test made on the 20th of August
For Sc. mcherry:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 1,828.
100µL of the 10-5 dilution grew 56 colonies, so:
1 A = 3,1x106 cells/ml
For G1513:
Nothing... It seems that the colony used was dead so the cubes will not contained any G1513.
Results of the cube test made on the 20th of August
Sc. mcherry alone: 92%
Sc. mcherry in the mix (but dead G1513): 96%
G1513 alone: Nothing
August 25th
Results of the OD tests made on the 24th of August
For Sc. mcherry:
The first 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 1,921.
100µL of the dilutions grew:
Dilution
Number of colonies
10-4
505
10-5
39
1 A = 2,3x106 cells/mL
The second 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,523.
100µL of the 10-5 dilution grew 95 colonies.
so 1 A = 3,8x106 cells/mL
For G1513:
Nothing... We used cells from the previous culture, wich was dead, so it seems normal.
August 26th
Results of the cube test made on the 24th of August
Sc. mcherry alone: 122% et 162%
Sc. mcherry in the mix (but dead G1513): 178% et 217%
G1513 alone: Nothing
August 27th
Goal
We want to find a media that could be use in India to grow the yeasts and the Lactococcus lactis for cheap.
Material
Potatoes
Sugar
Water
Culture of Sc. mcherry
Culture of G1513
Erythromycin, Geneticin
Tecan and Tecan plate
Mineral oil
Procedure
Make 3 different potato juice solutions(low, medium and high concentration of potatoes) following this protocol
For each one of these solutions, make samples with different concentration of sugar: 0g/ml; 0,1g/ml; 0,2g/ml; 0,4g/ml.
Inoculate the strains in these media, with the appropriate antibiotics (do not mix G1513 and Sc. mcherry)
Put 150μL of the solutions in Tecan plate wells and add 50μL of oil
Put in the Tecan at 30°C, measuring the OD every 15minutes, for 2 days
August 28th
Goal
We want to see how the strains in the cubes react when put in idli.
Procedure
Following the idli recipe protocol , make idli.
Weigh the cube
Dilute the cube in 5ml of osmosed water
Add this solution to 1 bottle of idli before the fermentation
After the fermentation, plate 100μL of a 10-2 dilution of the Idli water
August 31th
Results of the media test made on the 27th of August
It's a fail, the OD was too high so we can't really see the growth.
We did it again, diluting the inoculated media 200times in osmosed water.
Results of the idli test
Number of cells in the top part of the idli, 10-2 dilution
Number of cells in the middle part of the idli, 10-2 dilution
Number of cells in the bottom part of the idli, 10-2 dilution

September 2nd
Results of the second media test made on the 31st of August
It's a fail, there was almost only water in the well so nothing grew.
We will do it again, asking for a real protocol to our advisors, because obviously, there was a misunderstanding.
September 4th
Procedure
We tried the new method for the Tecan test.
This time, we did an overnight culture for each media and each strain, that we diluted 200times (till we get an OD smaller than 0,01)
September 6th
Procedure
We made fresh new cultures of G1513 and Sc. mcherry.
September 7th
Results of the Tecan test made on the 4th of September
Third fail, because one parameter was changed and we didn't noticed: the Tecan measured the OD for only few hours, not enough to see the growth...
September 8th
Procedure
Today we used the fresh cultures we made on the 6th of August to make lots of new cubes and OD test.
After centrifugation, throwing the media and  replacing it by osmosed water, the cultures gave us two solutions:
Solution X: 8,8x107 cells of Sc. mcherry per ml
Solution Y: 5,2x109 cells of G1513 per ml
We made 3 different types of cubes:
Cubes Q: 15ml of rice flour, 6ml of osmosed water and 1ml of solution X
Cubes R: 15ml of rice flour, 5ml of osmosed water, 900μL of solution X and 1ml of solution Y
Cubes S: 15ml of rice flour, 6ml of osmosed water and 1ml of solution Y

So, for Sc. mcherry: 1A=2,5x107 cells/ml
For G1513: 1A=1,1x108 cells/ml
September 9th
We plated the first cubes today.
Everyday, we will follow the same protocol:
Weigh the cube
Dilute the cube in 10ml of osmosed water during 5min
Dilute the solution obtained 10-1, 10-2 and 10-3 times
Plate the dilutions
This should only take 20min in total, doing it for all the cubes in the same time.
For more clarity, we will write the results for each cubes on the day we plated it (even if the colonies took 1 or 2 days to grow depending on the strains, so we only add the results 2 days after the plating).
