Constant Bourdeloux
Second year student at ESPCI ParisTech graduate engineering school of physics, chemistry and biology. I've done a prep class in mathematics, physics, chemistry and technology in Paris. I am involved in different projects but IGEM is my first biology contest. I usually work on non-destructive testing or with ion-propelled aircraft but I've pretended to be a biologist during this summer! Just joking, I've designed the cells population evolution model.

Barthélémy Caron
I am a M2 student in the AIV master at the CRI, Paris. I've a background in microbiology, genetics and molecular biology. I'm really interested in synthetic biology and all the related fields and enjoy playing strategy games and practicing sport.

Jean-Baptiste Caron
I am in love with science and especially with biology. I believe that transhumanism and synthetic biology are the only sustainable futures for mankind. I am a student in the ”Interdisciplinary approach in life sciences” Master in Paris. Beside of my courses I like to talk about the universe, about science and about ethic. I also like sport and strategy games.

Ewen Corre
Currently in the program “Interdisciplinary Approaches in Life Sciences” (AIV) I enjoy learning new stuff, especially related to life sciences. I joined the team because of the incredible things we can achieve thanks to synthetic biology. But also because all the other things a team involves: organization, communication, design, parties and fun!

Jérémy Ferrando
I am a M2 student in Strate design school with a passion for letters and calligraphy. With iGEM I am discovering a mystic world where bacteria can produce almost whatever you want! I am used to live during the night. You will find me at the bar of  the Jamboree for a chat or more.

Célia Foulon
I’m 21 and currently a 2nd year student at AgroParisTech. I found out about iGEM haphazardly, but since I love science (especially biology) and I’m always seeking for new adventures, I’ve decided to join the team. I’m learning a lot thanks to all the amazing (and crazy) people I’ve met during this experience. By the end of september, I should be an expert at micropipetting!
Favorite quote: There are no problems, only solutions.
Prateek Garg
I'm a Masters student with a background in Physics, Chemistry, Computational Sciences (little biology), but have learnt a lot of Biology during my work for iGEM. What attracts me to iGEM is the design and the human practices, which is so different from the "boring" (haha) normal lab science. I basically managed all the different projects in the team, and was also involved deeply in the design thinking, human practices, mathematical modeling and conceptualizing ideas, and loved it all. But the hectic summer took me off my love of sports, and I'm not complaining a lot. It was worth it :)

Sophie Gontier
I’m a student in both philosophy of science and biology, and I fell in love with synthetic biology two years ago. I discovered the iGEM competition last year when I joined the Evry team, and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to participate again. This year, as part of the Paris Bettencourt team, I spent way more time in the lab and was able to learn so many things, this experience was once again invaluable!

Abdou Hadjadj
I am a student in bioengineering that loves biology and especially physiology. I did two years in med school that really made me discover biology and made me love it along with the different life sciences. I joined iGEM this year thanks to a rouya of mine that heard about it and told me it could be interesting experience (sadly, he couldn't participate). In theteam, I was part of the Human practice and I tried to collect as much information about the acceptance of our project. Besides like to read fantasy and scientific books, I like to watch movies and I play a lot of video games.

Arthur Molkhar
I’ve been in love with genetics for a while now, what I appreciate in synthetic biology is that it  gives us the power to be creative, and this is now so simple to be a part of it, as tools are really simplified. I look forward to see how synbio is going to be huge and more opened to the public. When I’m not tinkering bacteria with the Bettencourt team I’m studying Pharmacie, 5th year now. I also swim a lot in those microbe nest that are parisians swimming pools. I also love being in the woods, take a breath.

Amaury Monmeyran
I was trained in fundamental physics during my undergrade, but now, I am M2 AIV student at the University Paris7 - Denis Diderot where I studied computational, systems and synthetic biology with point of view of my physic background.

Shazzad Hossain Mukit
M2 (AIV) student at the french epicentre of Synthetic biology - CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity), Paris and University of Paris Diderot. I was trained as microbiologist and now continuing biology by learning and doing Synthetic biology. I am a philomath in life and this summer I am “Playing God” by doing iGEM, as mentioned in a BBC documentary on Synbio.

Cloé Pierson
I am student in biotechnologies at LVC high school. I took part of this project by the way of the SynBio Challenge, which allowed me to join the Paris Bettencourt team. I’m learning a lot during this experience, thanks to all the amazing people.

Émilie Tavan
I am 20. I am student in BTS Biotechnology at LVC high school,I 'd like to do my job bio .I get in IGem team thanks to the little competition SynBio Challenge, with Cloé, I work on the phytase. i much enjoy working in this team, I learned a lot . I discovered that the synthetic biology are a topic very is interessant.

Antoine Vigouroux
Because a summer without discovering anything is a dull summer, I took part in this crazy project. Aside from doing science I like to spend my time playing music, tinkering, reading comic books and cooking stuff. By the way, I am a 6th year pharmacy student doing a biophysics master at École Polytechnique.

Juanma Garcia-Arcos
I am a grad student at University Paris Descartes in Paris, but have previously studied and worked in the US, Spain, the UK and Ireland. My love to science is complemented with a big dose of arts, design, politics, history and education. I am taking a gap year in education science and governance before starting my PhD in biology. I took this summer to help the iGEM team Paris Bettencourt as an advisor, a team with whom I participated in iGEM last year.

Ariel Lindner
I'm a researcher director at the Systems Evolutions and Engineering Dynamics (SEED) group at the French national Biomedical research Institute (INSERM) and co-founder of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI). Since 2006 I've been mentoring the first French team to participate in the iGEM adventure and still enjoy being challenged by team's students and see their projects flower.

Ihab Boulas
After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time.
Jake Wintermute
I’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students. I did my Ph.D. in Pam Silver’s lab in the Harvard Systems Biology department. My research interests include aging, evolution, metabolism and of course Synthetic Biology.
