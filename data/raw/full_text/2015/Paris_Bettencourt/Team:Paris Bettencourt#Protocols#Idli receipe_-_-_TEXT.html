Idli and Micro-organisms
Idli receipe
Soak rice and dall separately for 4-5 hours. (for 1.5 volume of rice, put the same volume of water, and 0.5 volume of dall, put the same volume of water).
Rinse both, mix it, add 2/3 volume of water of this volume.
Blend this mix, and let ferment  for 12-16 hours.
Then Cook it with idli cooker for 15 minutes.
In the case where we add micro-organisms, we have 3 options :
1) Add µorganisms during the soak phase;
2) Add µorganisms after the blending phase.
3) Let soak µorganisms in the same time that rices and dall, and add it for the blending phase.
The third was principally used.
