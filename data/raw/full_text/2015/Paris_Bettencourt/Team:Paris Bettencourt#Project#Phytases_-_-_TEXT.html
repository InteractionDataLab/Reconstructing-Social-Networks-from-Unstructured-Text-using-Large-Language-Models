Vitamin B12
Background
Aims
Results
Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is widely spread in India, due to diet that is mostly vegetarian.
We aimed at introducing a high-level cobalamin producer to the rice batter.

Introduction
Phytic acid (C6H18O24P6) is a molecul wich inhibit the absorption of differents  cations like iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, calcium and cobalt. It make insoluble salts around this elements, say phytate. This complexes are not soluble, so it is harmful to digestion and absorption of the minerals wich are essential to growth. They are difficult to find in our alimentation, and the absence of this minerals may be the cause of the food deficiency.
The cereals are the food inside we find the most of phytic acid.
The idli is constituate of cereals principally. The majority of minerals present are not absorb. We want to find a solution to the food deficiency, like the study of vitamines.
Phytase
The solution we find is the phytase. It’s a enzyme wich hydrolysis phytates created by the acid phytic when it link to a mineral. In this way, cations will be liberate and may be absorb by the organism.
So, we have to find a way to this system be integrated in the food, because if we just add the enzyme to the bacterial mirobiome, it will be present only on the beginning and the phytase will be not product.
The phytase it’s a enzyme product naturally by Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Jenny Veide, Thomas Andlid 2006]. The yeast contain negative regulator genes, and because of it, the phytase is product in very small quantity.
The negatives regulators are producted by two important genes in Saccharomyces cerevsiae : PHO80 on chromosome 15 (325.249pb - 326.130pb) and PHO85 on chomosome 16 (492.018pb - 493.037pb). With the deletion of this genes, the phytase may be overproduct.
Design
To test our experiment, we use a kit wich permit to dose the phytic acid by colorimetry. We can do this dosage with HPLC chromatography, but it’s a complicated procedure.
