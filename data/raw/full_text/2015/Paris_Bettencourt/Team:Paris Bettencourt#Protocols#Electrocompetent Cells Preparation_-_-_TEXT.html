Electrocompetent Cells Preparation Protocol
Inoculate two 250mL LB flasks with 100µL of an overnight culture of DH5α
Incubate until the the DO600 reach 0.5 to 0.7
Place the cultures on ice for 15 minutes
For the culture in cold sterile 50mL falcon tubes
Centrifuge them for 10 minutes at 6000rpm
Throw the supernatant
Resuspend the cells in 50mL cold distilled water
Centrifuge them for 10 minutes at 6000rpm
Throw the supernatant
Resuspend the cells in 25mL cold distilled water
Centrifuge them for 10 minutes at 6000rpm
Throw the supernatant
Resuspend the cells in 12.5mL cold 10% glycerol
Centrifuge them for 10 minutes at 6000rpm
Throw the supernatant
Resuspend the cells in 5mL cold 10% glycerol
Make aliquots of the desire volume in microcentrifuge tubes and freeze them at -80°C
