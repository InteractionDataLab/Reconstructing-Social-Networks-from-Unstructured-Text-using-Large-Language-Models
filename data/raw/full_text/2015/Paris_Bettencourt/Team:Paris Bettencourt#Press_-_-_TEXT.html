NightScience
NightScience is an annual event hold at CRI . It gathers researchers, hackers and education innovators to share their approaches and experience on building new ways to achieve better knowledge construction and transmission.
This year, NightScience focused on "Equitable Access to Scientific Research and Education" in the light of Low Cost Technologies and Frugal Innovation.
During this event, our team conducted a workshop about food, fermentation and nutrition. It was also the opportunity to showcase our project. One of our members, Prateek Garg , was interviewed and presented the workshop.
