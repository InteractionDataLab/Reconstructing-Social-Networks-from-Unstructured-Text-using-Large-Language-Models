Introduction
Based on a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) describing the kinetics of cell differentiation, we designed a model to find the best differentiation rate.
First we developed a deterministic algorithm based on the ordinary differential equation.
Then we found out that a stochastic algorithm could be another solution to solve our problem.
For a system involving large cell counts, the ordinary differential equations model gives an accurate representation of the behavior. But with small cell counts, the stochastic and discrete method has a significant influence on the observed behaviour.
This led us to write both a deterministic program based on the mass action law and a stochastic program based on Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). With these two programs we obtain an accurate analysis of vitamin production.
Deterministic model
Parameters
We conceived a simple model with the minimum number of parameters.
We found seven significant parameters for our model.
\(t\) : fermentation period.
\(k_{1}\) : rate constant of the mother cell differentiation.
\(k_{2}\) : rate constant of the mother cell doubling time.
\(k_{3}\) : rate constant of the differentiated cell doubling time.
\(k_{4}\) : rate constant of the differentiated cell vitamin production.
\(MC_{0}\) : initial number of mother cells in the medium.
\(DC_{0}\) : initial number of differentiated cells in the medium.
Kinetic equations
We wrote four simple kinetic equations.
\[ \begin{align} MC \xrightarrow[]{k_{1}} DC \\ MC \xrightarrow[]{k_{2}} 2.MC \\ DC \xrightarrow[]{k_{3}} 2.DC \\ DC \xrightarrow[]{k_{4}} DC + Vitamin \end{align} \]
Formal mathematical solution
Translation in ordinary differential equations
We used the law of mass action to write the ordinary differential equations based on kinetic equations \((1)\), \((2)\), \((3)\) and \((4)\).
We found the following equations.
\[ \begin{align} \frac{dMC}{dt}(t) = (k_{2} - k_{1}).MC(t) \end{align} \]  \[ \begin{align} \frac{dDC}{dt}(t) = k_{1}.MC(t) + k_{3}.DC(t) \end{align} \]  \[ \begin{align} \frac{dVitamin}{dt}(t) = k_{4}.DC(t) \Rightarrow Vitamin(t) = k_{4}.\int_{0}^{t}{DC(t').dt'} \end{align} \]
Mathematical resolution
Simple ordinary differential equations' resolution methods are used to find the solutions of the previous equations \((5)\), \((6)\), and \((7)\).
We expressed the time evolution of the mother cell, differentiated cell and vitamin number.
\[ \begin{align} MC(t) = MC_{0}.e^{(k_{2} - k_{1}).t} \end{align} \]
\[ \begin{align} DC(t) =  \begin{cases} DC_{0}.e^{k_{3}.t} + MC_{0}.\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}-k_{1}-k_{3}}.(e^{(k_{2} - k_{1}).t} - e^{k_{3}.t}) & \mbox{if } k_{1} \ne k_{3} - k_{2} \\ \\ (MC_{0}.(k_{2} - k_{3}).t + DC_{0}).e^{k_{3}.t} & \mbox{if } k_{1} = k_{3} - k_{2} \end{cases} \end{align} \]
\[ \begin{align} Vitamin(t) =  \begin{cases} DC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}}{k_{3}}.(e^{k_{3}.t} - 1) + MC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}.k_{1}}{(k_{2}-k_{1}-k_{3}).(k_{2} - k_{1})}.(e^{(k_{2} - k_{1}).t} -  1) + MC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}.k_{1}}{(k_{2}-k_{1}-k_{3}).k_{3}}.(1 - e^{k_{3}.t}) & \mbox{if } k_{1} \ne k_{3} - k_{2} \\ \\ DC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}}{k_{3}}.(e^{k_{3}.t} - 1) + MC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}}{k_{3}}.(k_{3}.t - 1).(\frac{k_{2}}{k_{3}} - 1).(e^{k_{3}.t} - 1) +   MC_{0}.\frac{k_{4}}{k_{3}}.(\frac{k_{2}}{k_{3}} - 1) & \mbox{if } k_{1} = k_{3} - k_{2} \end{cases} \end{align} \]
Vitamin optimization
Our goal is to optimize the vitamin production. We can only change three parameters : \(k_{1}\), \(MC_0\) and \(DC_0\).
\(t\), \(k_{2}\), \(k_{3}\) and \(k_{4}\) are constants. \(MC_0\) and \(DC_0\) are not relevant parameters. It seems logical that the  more cells are in the medium, the more vitamins are produced.
However, it could be interesting to compare different \(\frac{MC_0}{DC_0}\) ratios but we prefer to focus on the rate constant \(k_{1}\).
We try to find the best \(k_{1}\). To this end we maximize the vitamin function numerically with MATLAB.
As an example, let's consider the following parameters.
\(t = 10 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(k_{2} = 0.66 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\)
\(k_{3} = 0.33 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\)
\(k_{4} = 1 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\)
\(MC_0 = 5 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
\(DC_0 = 0 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
We obtain the following graph with a simple MATLAB program available on the software section.
Figure 1 : Deterministic vitamin optimization.
As you can see, we are able to find the best \(k_{1}\) to optimize the vitamin production.
We noticed that two different \(k_{1}\) exist to optimize the maximum number of differentiated cell \(DC\) or the maximum number of \(Vitamin\).
In our case, we chose of course the \(k_{1}\) that optimizes the vitamin production i.e. \(k_{1} = 0.207 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\).
Deterministic evolution of mother cell, differentiated cell and vitamin numbers
We wrote a deterministic algorithm with MATLAB using the previous solutions \((8)\), \((9)\) and \((10)\). For those interested, the source code is available on the software section.
In order to optimize the vitamin production, we use the same parameters as previously and set \(k_{1}\) with the previous resulting value i.e. \(k_{1} =  0.207 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\).
We obtain the following graph.
Figure 2 : Deterministic evolution of the system.
As you can see, the mother cell, the differentiated cell and the vitamin numbers follow an exponential law of time.
This result seems relevant. The model does not take into account the cells' death and the nutrients present in the medium.
Stochastic model
Parameters
We used more parameters than the deterministic model. Indeed, because of the nature of the algorithm, we need a constant rate probability distribution.
In order to do a simulation with laboratory data, we modelize the time probability distribution with a normalized Gaussian distribution using the normrnd MATLAB function.
For each time distribution \(i\), we use the following time probability distribution. \[ \begin{align} \mathcal P_{i}(t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{i}.\sqrt{2\pi}}.e^{\frac{-(t - \mu_{i})^2}{2.\sigma_{i}^2}} \end{align} \]  where
\(\mathcal P_{i}(t)\) : time \(t\) probability.
\(\mu_{i}\) : time mean.
\(\sigma_{i}\) : time standard deviation.
Rate constants for the time distribution \(i\) are calculated using the following formula. \[ \begin{align} k_{i} = \frac{ln(2)}{t} \end{align} \]  The time \(t\) is a random variable with a probability \(\mathcal P_{i}(t)\) as explained above.
The vitamin number is computed by numerical integration using the rate constant \(k_{4}\).
We have ten parameters for this model.
\(t\) : fermentation period.
\(\mu_{1}\) : mother cell differentiation time mean.
\(\sigma_{1}\) : mother cell differentiation time standard deviation.
\(\mu_{2}\) : mother cell doubling time mean.
\(\sigma_{2}\) : mother cell doubling time standard deviation.
\(\mu_{3}\) : differentiated cell doubling time mean.
\(\sigma_{3}\) : differentiated cell doubling time standard deviation.
\(k_{4}\) : rate constant of the differentiated cell vitamin production.
\(MC_0\) : initial number of mother cells in the medium.
\(DC_0\) : initial number of differentiated cells in the medium.
Algorithm
Introduction
In the program, each cell is a structure containing three elements.
The cell type.
1 : mother cell.
2 : differentiated cell.
The next event type.
1 : a mother cell becomes a differentiated cell.
2 : a mother cell divides into two mother cells.
3 : a differentiated cell divides into two differentiated cells.
The time before the next event.
The time \(T_{i}\) for an event is chosen thanks to the equation \((11)\).
There is a competition between the first two events concerning the mother cell.
Either the mother cell differentiates or it divides into two differentiated cells.
To do the choice we compare \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\). The smallest time is the next event time.
Step 1 : Initialize the cells.
First of all we have to generate the first cells in accordance with \(MC_0\) and \(DC_0\).
For each cell we set the cell type, the next event and the time before the next event.
Step 2 : Choose the next event among all cells.
We have an array containing all the cells. Each cell contains the time before its next event (divide or differentiate).
The next event time processed by the algorithm is the smallest cell next event time.
Step 3 : Do the next event.
Now that we know the next event type and the concerned cell (only one cell is involved here), we compute this event.
As explained above, we have three choices.
If the cell is a mother cell, the cell can divide or differentiate.
If the cell is a differentiated cell, the cell can only divide.
We define a new event and time event for the cell and for the new cell in case of division.
We also performed the number of vitamin calculus by numerically integrating the number of \(DC\).
We use the following formula.  \[ \begin{align} Vitamin(t) = Vitamin(t-T_{i}) + k_{4}.DC(t).T_{i} \end{align} \]  where
\(Vitamin(t)\) : number of vitamin at the instant \(t\).
\(DC(t)\) : number of differentiated cells in the medium at the instant \(t\).
\(T_{i}\) : time of the next event being performed.
\(k_{4}\) : rate constant of the differentiated cell vitamin production.
Step 4 : Update the simulation time.
For each cell except the concerned cell, define the cell next event time with the following formula.  \[ \begin{align} T_{event \phantom{t} cell} = T_{event \phantom{t} cell} - T_{i} \end{align} \]  where
\(T_{i}\) : time of the next event being performed.
\(T_{event \phantom{t} cell}\) : cell next time event.
Step 5 : Go to step 2 until the simulation time is superior to the fermentation period.
We do this process until the simulation time is superior to the fermentation period. The number of cells increases with an exponential law. The computational power increases with the same law.
Do not try to process a long simulation time if your computer is not powerful.
Step 6 : Show the results.
Here is a graph generated by the stochastic algorithm.
Figure 3 : Stochastic evolution of the system.
With the following distribution of event time probability.
Figure 4 : Distribution of event time probability.
Vitamin optimization
Like the deterministic model our goal is to maximize the vitamin production.
In order to get relevant results, we average by doing a large number of simulations specified by the \(Averaging\) \(number\) parameter.
We can only change three parameters : \(\mu_{1}\), \(MC_0\) and \(DC_0\).
\(t\), \(\sigma_{1}\), \(\mu_{2}\), \(\sigma_{2}\),  \(\mu_{3}\), \(\sigma_{3}\) and \(k_{4}\) are constants.
We try to find the best \(\mu_{1}\) to maximize the vitamin production.
As an example we can consider the following parameters.
\(t = 5 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(Averaging\) \(number = 500\)
\(\sigma_{1} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\mu_{2} = 1.0502 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\sigma_{2} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\mu_{3} = 2.1004 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\sigma_{3} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(k_{4} = 1 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\)
\(MC_0 = 5 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
\(DC_0 = 0 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
We obtain the following graph.
Figure 5 : Stochastic vitamin optimization.
Here is a deterministic vitamin optimization.
Figure 6 : Deterministic vitamin optimization.
We can compare the two results by superimposing the two graphs.
Figure 7 : Comparison of deterministic and stochastic vitamin optimization.
We performed a cross-correlation and found correlation coefficients between the two graphs with the xcorr and corr2 MATLAB functions.
Figure 8 : Deterministic and stochastic cross-correlation and correlation coefficients.
As described in the official MATLAB website , the \(DC\) and \(Vitamin\) correlation coefficients are computed with the following formula.
\[ \begin{align}  DC \phantom{t} correlation \phantom{t} coefficient = \frac{\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (DC_{d}(k_{1}) - \overline{DC_{d}}).(DC_{s}(k_{1}) - \overline{DC_{s}})} {\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (DC_{d}(k_{1}) - \overline{DC_{d}})^2 \right).\left(\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (DC_{s}(k_{1}) - \overline{DC_{s}})^2 \right)}}  \end{align} \]
\[ \begin{align}  Vitamin \phantom{t} correlation \phantom{t} coefficient = \frac{\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (Vitamin_{d}(k_{1}) - \overline{Vitamin_{d}}).(Vitamin_{s}(k_{1}) - \overline{Vitamin_{s}})} {\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (Vitamin_{d}(k_{1}) - \overline{Vitamin_{d}})^2 \right).\left(\sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} (Vitamin_{s}(k_{1}) - \overline{Vitamin_{s}})^2 \right)}}  \end{align} \]
The \(DC\) and \(Vitamin\) cross-correlation are computed with these equations.
\[ \begin{align}  DC \phantom{t} cross\text{-}correlation(k_{1}') = \sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} DC_{d}(k_{1}).DC_{s}(k_{1} + k_{1}')  \end{align} \]  \[ \begin{align}  Vitamin \phantom{t} cross\text{-}correlation(k_{1}') = \sum\limits^{}_{k_{1}} Vitamin_{d}(k_{1}).Vitamin_{s}(k_{1} + k_{1}')  \end{align} \]  where
\(DC_{d}(k_{1})\) : deterministic \(DC\) function of \(k_{1}\).
\(DC_{s}(k_{1})\) : stochastic \(DC\) function of \(k_{1}\).
\(Vitamin_{d}(k_{1})\) : deterministic \(Vitamin\) function of \(k_{1}\).
\(Vitamin_{s}(k_{1})\) : stochastic \(Vitamin\) function of \(k_{1}\).
Conclusion
As we can see, the stochastic and the deterministic models provide a priori different results. It seems logical because of the statistical nature of the problem.
However, the comparison of the two graphs gives us useful and accurate information about the vitamin optimization.
Because of small cell counts, the stochastic and discrete method has a significant influence on the observed behaviour.
In vivo, the cell population likely follows the stochastic model. We are waiting for laboratory results to confirm or disprove our model.
We are able to maximize the vitamin production by determining the best rate constant \(k_{1}\) and therefore the best doubling time \(\mu_{1}\) to set the differentiation rate.
Software

In order to make this model and code accessible, understandable and editable by everyone, we have created this software section.
We focus here on the stochastic program.

Input
In order to launch a simulation, you must define five variables.
Initial cells.
Rate constants.
Fermentation period.
Action.
Folder name.
Cells input
You can choose to generate a random or a predetermined position for the initial cells.
You have two cell types : mother cells and differentiated cells.
Random initial position
The input array must contain four integer values in this order.
\(MC_0\) : initial number of mother cells in the medium.
\(DC_0\) : initial number of differentiated cells in the medium.
\(sizeMatCell\) : cells box size (in pixels).
\(sizeMat\) : real box size (in pixels).
Warning : \(sizeMatCell\) must be larger than \(sizeMat\).
In the program, the input variable has the following pattern.
\(input = [MC_0, DC_0, sizeMatCell, sizeMat]\)
Here is an example.
\(MC_0 = 5 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
\(DC_0 = 0 \phantom{t} (cells)\)
\(sizeMatCell = 100 \phantom{t} (pixels)\)
\(sizeMat = 250 \phantom{t} (pixels)\)
Predetermined initial position
In order to make an easy predetermined initial position input, we wrote a code that understands images.
The input must contain the image path.
It is very easy to design a custom image i.e. a custom spatial cell distribution. You must follow these four rules (we work only with the image red component)
the image must be square and in jpeg format.
255 means no cell.
128 means one differentiated cell.
0 means one mother cell.
0, 128 and 255 are red components of any colours that you want because the MATLAB code take into account only the image red component.
If you want, you can use the following hexadecimal colors codes.
#FFFFFF (white) means no cell.
#800000 (red) means one differentiated cell.
#000000 (black) means one mother cell.
Here is an example only with mother cells.
Figure 9 : Example of predetermined cells initial position with mother cells.
Here is another example with mother cells (black) and differentiated cells (red).
Figure 10 : Example of predetermined cells initial position with mother cells (black) and differentiated cells (red).
Rate constants
You have to define seven variables.
\(\mu_{1}\) : mother cell differentiation time mean.
\(\sigma_{1}\) : mother cell differentiation time standard deviation.
\(\mu_{2}\) : mother cell doubling time mean.
\(\sigma_{2}\) : mother cell doubling time standard deviation.
\(\mu_{3}\) : differentiated cell doubling time mean.
\(\sigma_{3}\) : differentiated cell doubling time standard deviation.
\(k_{4}\) : rate constant of the differentiated cell vitamin production.
In the program, the rate constants variable has the following pattern.
\(constantRate = [\mu_{1}, \sigma_{1}, \mu_{2}, \sigma_{2}, \mu_{3}, \sigma_{3}, k_{4}]\)
Here is an example.
\(\mu_{1} = 1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\sigma_{1} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\mu_{2} = 1.0502 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\sigma_{2} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\mu_{3} = 2.1004 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(\sigma_{3} = 0.1 \phantom{t} (hours)\)
\(k_{4} = 1 \phantom{t} (hours^{-1})\)
Fermentation period
The fermentation period \(t\) is a simple scalar variable.
You can use \(t = 5 \phantom{t} (hours)\) for example.
Action
In order to choose what you want to do, you must define three Boolean variables.
\(createFolder\) : create a folder in the disk to save information.
\(showAnimation\) : show the cell population animation. Warning : requires a lot of computing power.
\(plotGraph\) : plot the results in graphs.
In the program, the action variable has the following pattern.
\(action = [createFolder, showAnimation, plotGraph\)]
In the following example we want to create a folder and plot the graphs.
\(createFolder = 1\)
\(showAnimation = 0\)
\(plotGraph = 1\)
In the following example we want to show the cell animation.
\(createFolder = 0\)
\(showAnimation = 1\)
\(plotGraph = 0\)

With the images you can create gif animations.
\(createFolder = 1\)
\(showAnimation = 1\)
\(plotGraph = 0\)
