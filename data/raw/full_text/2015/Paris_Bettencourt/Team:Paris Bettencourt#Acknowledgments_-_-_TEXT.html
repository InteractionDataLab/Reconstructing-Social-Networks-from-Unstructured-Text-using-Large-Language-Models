Host Laboratory
Our iGEM team is kindly hosted in the CRI (Inderdisciplinary Research Center) located in theFaculté de médecine Paris Descartes at the center of Paris. In the heart of one of Paris' biggest hospitals, the CRI hosts interdisciplinary undergraduate (LFdV), Master (AIV); devoted also to systems and synthetic biology!) as well as a PhD program (FdV). This center is directed by François Taddei and Ariel Lindner.
For the Laboratory's facilities, we are kindly hosted by the CRI/INSERM U1001 lab, that lent us benches, microscopes and others facilities. We thank all the members of the INSERM U1001 for their kind help and that they shared not only their equipment but also their experience with us. We would like to give a special thank Chantal Lotton, the lab manager, for her advices on the bench, her warm words, her organization skills, her introductions, for being there for us any time and that she ensured that we worked safely.
