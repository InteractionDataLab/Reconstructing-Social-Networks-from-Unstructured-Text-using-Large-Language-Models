Introduction
The students came up with and developed the project independently during several brainstorming sessions held in the beginning of 2015 in the Centre for Research and Inderdisciplinarity in Paris.
The instructors and advisors were providing feedback and advice, when needed.  All of the designs, constructs, and experiments presented in this wiki were performed by the students of the 2015 Paris Bettencourt team.

Host Lab
We were hosted at the CRI (Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity) located in the University Paris Descartes. The host lab provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, PCR machines, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, a NanoDrop machine, etc. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA. All the media preparation and the glassware washing was done by us.
