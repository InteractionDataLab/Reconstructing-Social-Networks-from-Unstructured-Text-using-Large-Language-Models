Electrocompetent Cells Preparation Protocol for Lactobacillus Plantarum
Inoculate 5ml MRS medium with L. plantarum freezer stock.
Grow overnight at 30°C without shaking.
Add 1.25g glycine to two flasks of 50ml MRS medium.
Shake to dissolve.
Add 1ml overnight culture to each flask (1:50 dlution).
Culture for ~3 hours at 37°C with shaking.
Centrifuge culture for 5min at 4000g
Resuspend in 25ml ice-cold DI water.
Repeat it.
Centrifuge for 5min at 4000g
Resuspend in 5ml 50mM EDTA.
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 25ml ice-cold DI water.
Centrifuge culture for 5min at 4000g
Resuspend in 25ml ice-cold DI water.
Centrifuge culture for 5min at 4000g
Resuspend in 25ml ice-cold 0.5M Sucrose, 10% glycerol.
Repeat it.
Centrifuge culture for 5min at 4000g
Resuspend in 0.8ml ice-cold 0.5M Sucrose, 10% glycerol.
Aliquot 90μL of cell concentrate into ~20 microcentrifuge tubes.
Keep on ice until use (within the next two hours).
Add 10μL of plasmid DNA to the 90μL of cell concentrate.
Keep on ice for 5 minutes.
Put 1mm cuvettes on ice too.
Pipette the cell/DNA mixture into the cuvette
Electrporate at 1200 volts
Time constant should be ~5.0
Immediately transfer the electroporated cells to 900μL of MRS medium.
Incubate at 30°C for 2-3 hours.
Plate on medium with the appropriate antibiotic
Incubate at 30°C for two days.
