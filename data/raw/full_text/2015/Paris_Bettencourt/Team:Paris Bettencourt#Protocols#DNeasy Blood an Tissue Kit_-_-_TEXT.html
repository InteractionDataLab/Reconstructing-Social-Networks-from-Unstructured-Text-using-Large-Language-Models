DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit
Excise the DNA band from the gel as precisely as possible and put it in a micro-centrifuge tube.
Add 3 volume of QG buffer (100mg of gel ~ 100ul) in the tube and incubate for 10 min at 50°C (or 10 min on a vortex).
Add one volume of isopropanol and mix.
vortex the tube for 2 min at 14 000 rpm.
Carefully pipette the supernanant in a QIAquick column.
Put the column in a 2ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge it for 1 min at 14 000 rpm.
Throw the supernatant.
Add 750 uL of PE buffer in the column and centrifuge for 1 min and discard flow-through.
Centrifuge again for 2 min and put the column in a new 1.5uL microcentrifuge tube.
Elute the DNA by putting 50uL of water in the middle of the column and let it stand for 2 min.
Centrifugate for 2min at 10 000 rpm
