Heat Shock transformation protocol
Thaw frozen chemically competent cells (20µL aliquots) on ice for 10min.
add 2µL of ligation product (or 0.5µL of miniprep) and incubate the cells 30sec at 42°C.
put the cells back on ice for 2min.
add 200µL of LB to the cells and incubate 2 hours at 37°C.
plate the cells on LB + erythromycin (150µg/mL) or LB + erythromycin (10µg/mL), incubation at 37°C overnight.
