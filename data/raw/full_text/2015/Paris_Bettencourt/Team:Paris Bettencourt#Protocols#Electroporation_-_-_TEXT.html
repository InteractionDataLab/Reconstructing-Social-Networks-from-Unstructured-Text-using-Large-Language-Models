Electroporation Protocol
Thaw electrocompetent cells on ice
Add 2µL of ligation product or 0.5µL of native plasmid to the cells
Transfer the cells in an 0.2mm electroporation cuvette
put the cuvette in the electroporation device and pulse the cells at 2.5kV, 200 Ohms and 25µF
add 200µL of LB right after pulsing
recover 2 hours at 37°C
plate 200µL and 50µL of the cells on LB + erythromycin (200µg/mL), incubate overnight at 37°C
