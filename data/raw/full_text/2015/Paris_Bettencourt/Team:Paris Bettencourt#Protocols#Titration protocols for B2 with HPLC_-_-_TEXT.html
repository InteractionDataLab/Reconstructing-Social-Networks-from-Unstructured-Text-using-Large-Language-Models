Titration protocols for vitamin A
Here, I find  2 different protocols to determine the quantity of B2 using HPLC.
I°) In a 250 ml conical flask, put 5g of food sample and 65 ml of 0.1M HCl.
Put it in 100°C for 30 minutes.
Cooling, then adjuste Ph to 4.5 with 2.5M sodium acetate.
Add 50ml Beta amylase, 500ml Takadiastase in water (small quantity). Put it at 37°C for 18h.
Dilutate with 125ml water.
Fitred with cellulose paper. And do a 2nd filtration with 0.2µm filter paper.
II°) Take Xg of food sample and add 15ml of 0.1M HCl.
Incubate at 100°C for 30 minutes.
Cooling, then add 2.5M sodium acetate (to have a Ph4.5) and add 10mg of Takadiastase. Incubate it at 50°C during 3h.
Filtred with Albert No 135.
Made up to 25ml with milli Q water.
Filtered with 0.2µm nylon filter.
