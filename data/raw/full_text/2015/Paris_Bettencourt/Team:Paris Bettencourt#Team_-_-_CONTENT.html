I've done a prep class in mathematics, physics, chemistry and technology in Paris.
I am involved in different projects but IGEM is my first biology contest. I usually work on non-destructive testing or with ion-propelled aircraft but I've pretended to be a biologist during this summer! Just joking, I've designed the cells population evolution model.</P><B>Favorite quote:</B><EM>Le cinéma français est à l’image de la France : on n’a pas assez de pognon et c’est comme ça dans tous les domaines.</EM><P style="float: right">— Michel Audiard</P></DIV><DIV class="descriptionArea magenta" id="BarthelemyCaron"><H3>Barthélémy Caron</H3><P>I am a M2 student in the AIV master at the CRI, Paris.

I'm really interested in synthetic biology and all the related fields and enjoy playing strategy games and practicing sport.</P><B>Favorite quote:</B><EM>&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;, Alan Moore</EM><P style="float: right">— </P></DIV><DIV class="descriptionArea cyan" id="Jean-BaptisteCaron"><H3>Jean-Baptiste Caron</H3><P>I am in love with science and especially with biology. I believe that transhumanism and synthetic biology are the only sustainable futures for mankind.
I am a student in the ”Interdisciplinary approach in life sciences” Master in Paris.
Beside of my courses I like to talk about the universe, about science and about ethic. I also like sport and strategy games.

I joined the team because of the incredible things we can achieve thanks to synthetic biology. But also because all the other things a team involves: organization, communication, design, parties and fun!

I found out about iGEM haphazardly, but since I love science (especially biology) and I’m always seeking for new adventures, I’ve decided to join the team. I’m learning a lot thanks to all the amazing (and crazy) people I’ve met during this experience. By the end of september, I should be an expert at micropipetting!

What attracts me to iGEM is the design and the human practices, which is so different from the &quot;boring&quot; (haha) normal lab science. I basically managed all the different projects in the team, and was also involved deeply in the design thinking, human practices, mathematical modeling and conceptualizing ideas, and loved it all. But the hectic summer took me off my love of sports, and I'm not complaining a lot. It was worth it :) </P><B>Favorite quote:</B><EM>You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.

I discovered the iGEM competition last year when I joined the Evry team, and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to participate again. This year, as part of the Paris Bettencourt team, I spent way more time in the lab and was able to learn so many things, this experience was once again invaluable!</P><B>Favorite quote:</B><EM>Mother Nature doesn't care if you're having fun.</EM><P style="float: right">— Larry Niven</P></DIV><DIV class="descriptionArea cyan" id="AbdouHadjadj"><H3>Abdou Hadjadj</H3><P>I am a student in bioengineering that loves biology and especially physiology. I did two years in med school that really made me discover biology and made me love it along with the different life sciences. I joined iGEM this year thanks to a rouya of mine that heard about it and told me it could be interesting experience (sadly, he couldn't participate). In theteam, I was part of the Human practice and I tried to collect as much information about the acceptance of our project. Besides like to read fantasy and scientific books, I like to watch movies and I play a lot of video games.</P><B>Favorite quote:</B><EM>We're made up of thousands of parts with thousands of functions all working in tandem to keep us alive.

I look forward to see how synbio is going to be huge and more opened to the public.
When I’m not tinkering bacteria with the Bettencourt team I’m studying Pharmacie, 5th year now. I also swim a lot in those microbe nest that are parisians swimming pools.

I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it.
