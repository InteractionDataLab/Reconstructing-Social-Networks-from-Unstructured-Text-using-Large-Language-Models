Gel-Electrophoresis protocol
Preparation of the Gel (50mL)
Mix 0.5 grams of agarose with 50mL 0.5% TAE solution
Heat the Erlenmeyer (conical flask) in a microwave until the liquid becomes totally transparent.
Let it rest until you can take the Erlenmeyer in your hand without pain for 10 seconds.
Add 5uL of SYBR® Safe (10000X) and mix gently until the solution homogenizes.
Pour the liquid in a gel mold with the desired number of wells and wait 20-30 min (or until the gel is solidified).
Put the gel inside the electrophoresis machine and pour TAE 0.5% until the gel is totally submerged.
Preparation of the samples
Mix 5uL of each sample with 1uL of 6X loading dye in microcentrifuge tubes (or any hydrophobic surface like parafilm)
Pipette 5-6uL of each sample inside a different well.
Pipette 5uL of the appropriate ladder in one of the wells (Some ladders have a dye in it, but some don't, so one has to add gel loading dye to these ones)
Close the machine and launch the migration with the desired voltage
After the desired migration time turn off the machine, remove the lid and put the gel inside the gel visualizer.
