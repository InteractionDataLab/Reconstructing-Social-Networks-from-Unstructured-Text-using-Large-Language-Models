Annealing Protocol
Phosphorylation of the oligos
5.6μL DNAse/RNAse free water
6.0μL   o15.011 (10µM)
6.0μL   o15.012 (10µM)
2.0μL   10X T4 DNA ligase buffer
0.4μL   T4 PolyNucleotide Kinase Total:   20μL
incube 30min at 37°C
add 1μL of 1M NaCl
incube 5min at 95°C
let the mix cool down
use 2μL of the mix as a 10X solution
