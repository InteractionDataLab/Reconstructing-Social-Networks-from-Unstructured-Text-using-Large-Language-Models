Miniprep protocol using a QIAGEN kit
centrifuge an overnight culture of cells 10min at 4krpm
throw the filtrate
resuspend the pellet in 250μL of Cell Resuspension Solution then mix it
transfer it in a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
add 250mL of Cell lysis solution and mix by inverting several times
incube until the liquid is clear, maximum 5min
add 10μL of Alkalyne protease solution, mix by inverting several times and incube 3 to 4 min
add 350μL of Neutralisation Solution and mix by inverting several times
centrifuge 10min at 14krpm
add the supernatant in a column
centrifuge 1min, 14krpm, then throw the filtrat
add 750μL Washing Solution
centrifuge 1min, 14krpm, then throw the filtrat
add 250μL Washing Solution
centrifuge 2min, 14krpm, then throw the filtrat
centrifuge 1min, 14krpm
transfer the column in a sterile microcentrifuge 1.5ml tube
add 50μL of DNAse/RNAse free water right on the membrane of the filter, wait 1min
centrifuge 1min, 14krpm
throw the column, plasmid is saved in water
