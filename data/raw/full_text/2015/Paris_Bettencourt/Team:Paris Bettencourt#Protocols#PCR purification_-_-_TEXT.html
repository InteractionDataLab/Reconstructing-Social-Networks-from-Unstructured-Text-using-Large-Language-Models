PCR purification protocol
Add 5 volumes of resuspension buffer to 1 volume of PCR product in an 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube, mix by pipetting up and down
Transfer in a centrifugation column
Centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm
Throw the filtration product
Add 700μL of washing solution
Centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm
Throw the filtration product
Add 500μL of washing solution
Centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm
Throw the filtration product
Centrifuge 1 min at 14000 rpm
Throw the filtration product
Put the column in a sterile 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
Add 45μL of DNAse/RNAse free water on the membrane
Wait 2 minutes
Centrifuge 2min at 10000rpm
Discard the column, DNA is saved in water </td>
