Titration protocols for vitamin A with HPLC
Suspend cells in 1 mL of sterile water.
Add 0.5 to 0.75 mm glass beads and vortex for 3 minutes.
Add 2.5 mL of 0.2% (wt/vol) pyrogallol dissolved in methanol and vortex for 3 minutes.
Add 1.25 mL of 60% (wt/vol) KOH and vortex for 10 seconds.
Incubate for 1 h at 75ºC, vortexing every 15 minutes.
Add appropriate amount of hexane.
Centrifuge tubes for 5 minutes at 2,800 rpm.
Pipette 1 mL of hexane into a cuvette.
