Throughout the summer, we have imagined a disruptive product that we believe will be a step forward for solving malnutrition.
We repurposed fermentation for creating nutrionally enhanced food
We created an modified strain of E. coli that produces vitamin B2 to high levels, and built a vector for allowing Lactococcus, an endogenous micro-organism of idli, to produce the vitamin as well.

We measured the overproduction of vitamin A by an engineered strain of S. cerevisiae, and showed that this does not significantly impair its growth. We demonstrated that backslopping of engineered strains is possible.
Read more...
We re-engineered the microbiome of traditional Indian dishes, and proved that an exogenous organism with high vitamin production can be introduced in idli.
Read more...
We modified the genetic regulation circuits of S. cerevisiae so it improves the rice's iron bioavailability by degrading phytic acid, a chelator of iron.
Read more...
We proved the safety of our product by proving that no micro-organism survives cooking, bringing new opportunities to the GMO debate.
Read more...
We designed a truly sustainable solution
We found effective, easily acceptable solutions for manufacturing, distribution and conservation of microbial products.
Read more...
We designed and constructed a new synthetic biology framework for microbes producing nutrients.
Read more...
We designed a device to detect vitamin B12 in food that is way cheaper than its analytical chemistry counterparts.
Read more...
We identified the needs of the target population and provided feasible solutions
We got promising feedback from Indian people, researchers and officials, including the former Director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and founder of IGIB.

We successfully defended our project in front of a citizen review commitee.
Read more...
We shown that rice is often the only resource people have, so our design will be an effective solution for them, as it can be manufactured with only rice water.
Read more...
We got a lot of citizen involvement and gathered more than fifty sale promises proving the high acceptance of our product by the community.
