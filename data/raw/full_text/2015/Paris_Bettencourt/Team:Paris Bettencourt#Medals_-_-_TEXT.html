Bronze
We registered for iGEM, had a great summer and attended the Giant Jamboree.
We completed the judging form .
We made a wiki and a poster to present our project.
We attributed the work done by our members and acknowledged the people who helped us.
We documented new standard BioBrick parts and submitted them to the Registry.
Silver
We experimentally validated that a new BioBrick part worked as expected, and documented the characterization in the Main Page of the Registry entry.
We submitted this new part to the Registry.
Our project tries to answer a problem with synthetic biology but we also kept in mind traditions, sustainability and social aspects. They are identified and addressed in the Practices and Design pages.
Gold
We have integrated and investigated issues from the Human Practices into the design/execution of the project and we have demonstrated an innovative Human Practices activity that relates to the project through our events .
We collaborated with many teams and helped them when we could.
We made a functional prototype of our project and described it in the Manufacturing page.
