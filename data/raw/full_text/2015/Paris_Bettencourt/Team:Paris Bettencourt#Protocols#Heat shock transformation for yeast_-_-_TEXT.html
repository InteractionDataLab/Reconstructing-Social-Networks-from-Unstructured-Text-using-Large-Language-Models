Transformation yeast Protocol
After growth, determine the titer of the yeast culture by using spectrophotometer : pipette 10µL of cells into 1mL of wtaer in spectrophotometer cuvette and measure the OD at 600nm.
Add 2.5x108 cells to 50mL of 2X YPD in a culture flask.
Incubate the flask in a shaking incubator at 30°C until the cell culture is at least 2x107 cells.mL-1
Denature 1mL of carrier DNA at 99°C for 5min and chill immediately in ice.
Harvest the yeast cells by centrifugation at 3,000g for 5min.
Resuspend the pellet in 25mL of sterile water and centrifuge at 3,000g for 5min at 20°C. Repeat this wash with sterile water 2 times.
Resuspend the last pellet in 1mL of sterile water.
Transfer the cell suspension to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge for 30s at 13,000g and discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the cells in 1mL of sterile water and pipette 100µL samples into 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes, one for each transformation.
For each transformation :
240µL of PEG 3350 (50% (w/v))
36µL of LiAc 1.0M
50µL of single-stranded carrier DNA (2.0mg.mL-1)
6µL of PCR product
28µL of water DNAse Free
Place the tubes at 42°C for 40min.
Centrifuge the tubes at 13,000g for 30s in a microcentrifuge tube and remove the supernatant.
Pipette 1mL of YPD liquid medium into the transformation tube, and vortex mix to resuspend pellet.
Incubate 3h at 30°C to ensure good antibiotic expression.
Plate 2, 20 and 200µL of the cell suspension onto YPD medium with 200µm.mL-1 antibiotic G418.
Incubate the plates at 30°C for 3 days.
