Let's do it!</H3><H2>Goal</H2>
The goal of this project is to create an way to grow and distribute our strains in India, easily and for cheap.
Since our genetically engineered strains will be ready only in september, we will not have time to work on it, so we have to find similar strains, that we can study and select with antibiotics.
We chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae  mcherry, wich is resistant to geneticin at a concentration of 200µg/mL, and produce RFP. Therefore, it's easy to select and characterize it.
Basically, we are going to try different ways to distribute the strains and see how well they survived for each process.
In order to do that, we will have to calculate a survival rate so we have to be able to know how many cells we are putting in the beggining, in the recipe we are trying.

That is what we did today, and we plated the different dilutions, thanks to the beads.



<H1 class="date one">July 28th</H1><H2>Goal</H2>
Our first idea to distribute the yeast was to simply dry them and collect the dry cells, without adding anything.
Today is a first try, to have an idea of how to do it.<H2>Material</H2><UL><LI>Culture of Sc. mcherry</LI><LI>YPD broth</LI><LI>Agar</LI><LI>Geneticin, 100mg/ml</LI><LI>Osmosed water</LI><LI>Sterile eppendorf tubes</LI><LI>Sterile plates and beads</LI></UL><H2>Procedure</H2><UL><LI>Centrifuge a culture tube</LI><LI>Throw the media away</LI><LI>Add 300µL of water to detach the yeasts from the tube easily</LI><LI>Spread on aluminium</LI><LI>Let it dry for 2 hours in the open air or in the incubator (2 different tests)</LI><LI>Scratch the aluminium to detach the dried yeasts</LI><LI>Put the powder in 10ml of osmosed water</LI><LI>Plate the solution to see if Sc. mcherry survived</LI></UL><H2>Results and discussion</H2><DIV class="column-left"><P>
We obtained this powder:
We realised the aluminium was not a good idea:
The yeasts stick to it and it gets destroyed when we scratch.
We have to find another drying paper, more resistant.</P></DIV><H1 class="date one">July 29th</H1><H2>Result of the OD test made on the 27th of July:</H2>
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,557.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution grew 359 colonies, so:<B>1 A = 1,4x10<SUP>7</SUP> cells/ml</B>
We repeated the very same OD experiment today, for more repetitions.


<H1 class="date one">July 30th</H1><H2>Results of the drying test made on the 28th of July:</H2>
Yeasts grew in the plate.
We can check that they produce RFP, it's Sc. mcherry who survived.<H2>Procedure</H2>
Today, we are repeating the drying experiment (see July 28th) but drying the yeasts on a plastic dish.<UL><LI>Take 100µL of the culture solution of Sc. mcherry to make dilutions (10<SUP>-1</SUP> to 10<SUP>-5</SUP>)</LI>
We remind that the culture tube contain 10ml of media.

The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,635.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution grew 205 colonies, so:<B>1 A = 7,8x10<SUP>6</SUP> cells/ml</B><H1 class="date two">August 1st</H1><H2>Result of the drying test made on the 30th of July:</H2>
100µL of the 10<SUP>-5</SUP> dilution of the initial 10ml culture solution grew 106 colonies, so we initially dried 1,06x10<SUP>9</SUP> cells.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution of the powder mixed with 30ml of osmosed water grew 123 colonies, so 8,4x10<SUP>8</SUP> cells survived.
We therefore have a survival rate of 79%.

<H2>Discussion and New Goal</H2>
The powder we obtained with the drying method stick to everything, because of static electricity and therefore, it is not very easy to distribute and manipulate.
Consequently, we are looking fo other solutions...
Our second idea was to cook a homemade powder with edible ingredients easily found in India.
We found a recipe that inspired us <A href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Stop-Paying-for-Yeast-Make-Your-Own/">here</A>. 
We decided to compare the initial recipe to our modifications, so we made for different tests :<UL><LI>Test 1, original recipe: wheat flour, sugar and ginger </LI>
Since the project is designed for rice fermentation and rice is cheaper than wheat, we wanted to try with rice flour.
<LI>Test 2: rice flour, sugar and ginger</LI>
Ginger can be expensive so maybe we can avoid using it...
<LI>Test 3: rice flour, sugar</LI>
And maybe we can also avoid using sugar
<LI>Test 4: only rice flour</LI></UL><H2>Material</H2><UL><LI>Culture of Sc. mcherry</LI><LI>Potatoes</LI><LI>Flour (wheat and rice)</LI><LI>Cornmeal</LI><LI>Sugar</LI><LI>Ginger</LI><LI>Plate of YPDagar+Gen(200)</LI><LI>Osmosed water</LI><LI>Sterile eppendorf tubes</LI><LI>Sterile beads</LI></UL><H2>Procedure</H2><DIV class="column-left"><UL><LI>Cook some potatoes</LI><LI>Save the cooking water, wait till it's not too hot and mix 20ml of it with the yeasts</LI><LI>Add 20ml of flour (rice or wheat depending on the recipe), 40ml of mashed potatoes</LI><LI>Depending on the recipe add 20ml of sugar and a teaspoon of ginger</LI><LI>Add 80ml of cornmeal</LI><LI>Let it dry for 1 day</LI><LI>Mill the paste to obtain a powder</LI><LI>Plate the powder obtained to see how many Sc. mcherry survived </LI></UL></DIV><H1 class="date two">August 3rd</H1><H2>Continuing the powder recipe we began on the 1st of August</H2><DIV class="column-left"><P>
After almost two days of drying, we obtained a very hard paste that we milled.
After milling, we had this nice yellow powder you can see on the picture.
We put 100mg of each powder in 10ml of osmosed water, made dilutions,
and plated the solutions in YPDagar+GEN(200) plates.
</P></DIV><H1 class="date two">August 4th</H1><H2>Discussion and New Goal</H2>
While doing the recipe with the potatoes (from the 1st to the 3rd of August), we realised it wasn't easy to do and it took lots of time and ingredients.
We decided to reduce the number of ingredients, using only water and rice flour.<H2>Procedure</H2><UL><LI>Mix the yeasts with 20ml of osmosed water</LI><LI>Add 40ml of rice flour</LI><LI>Knead till you get a nice paste</LI></UL>
At this point, we tought the paste could be shaped, instead of being milled in a powder.
<UL><LI>Shape it in little cubes</LI><LI>Let it dry for few hours</LI></UL><H2>Result</H2><DIV class="column-left"><P>
The result is a small solid cube, very easy to give away.
Several cubes can be packed together.
We tought it could be a good media of distribution.
We dissolved one cube in 10ml of osmosed water, after weighed it.
Then we made dilutions (10<SUP>-1</SUP> to 10<SUP>-5</SUP>) and plated 100µL of each on YPDagar+GEN(200)
</P></DIV><H1 class="date two">August 5th</H1><H2>Results of the survival of Sc. mcherry in the potato powder made on the 3rd of August:</H2>
Survival rate:
<UL><LI>Wheat flour, sugar and ginger: 14% </LI><LI>Rice flour, sugar and ginger: 20%</LI><LI>Rice flour, sugar: 12%</LI><LI>Rice flour: 4%</LI></UL><H2>Discussion:</H2>
We can see that the more ingredients we put, the more the yeasts survived, so each ingredient plays a role in the cells survival.
But as we said before, we don't want to put too much ingredients in the recipe so that it's cheap and easy.
We can also notice that rice flour seems more efficient than wheat flour (but we made only one repetition so nothing is statistically proven).

<H1 class="date two">August 6th</H1><H2>Results of the survival of Sc. mcherry in the cubes made on the 4th of August:</H2><DIV class="column-left"><P>
We obtained a survival rate of 69%. 
After staying 5hours in the water, the survival rate reached 737%.
</P></DIV><H1 class="date two">August 7th</H1><H2>Goal</H2>
Now that we are at ease with the process, we are trying the very same process with lactococcus lactis.
We chose MG 13.63, containing the plasmid PSIP411, resistant to erythromycin at a concentration of 10µL/mL, to study it's survival rate.
We will name this strain G1513.
We also have to correlate the OD of a solution of G1513 to the number of alive cells inside.

<H2>Material</H2><UL><LI>Glycerol stock of G1513</LI><LI>M17 broth</LI><LI>Solution of D-Glucose</LI><LI>Agar</LI><LI>Erythromycin, 20mg/ml</LI><LI>Osmosed water</LI><LI>Sterile eppendorf tubes</LI><LI>Sterile plates and beads</LI></UL><H2>Procedure</H2><UL><LI>Make a culture of G1513 in 10ml of M17+1% glucose media adding 5µL of erythromycin</LI>
(We did cultures on the 6th of August)
<LI>One day later, centrifuge the culture tube</LI><LI>Throw the media away and replace it by 10ml of osmosed water</LI><LI>Measure the OD, doing the blank with osmosed water</LI><LI>If the OD is too high to be measured, make a 10 times dilution and measure the OD of the dilution</LI><LI>In the eppendorf tubes, make 10<SUP>-1</SUP> to 10<SUP>-5</SUP> dilutions of the G1513/water solution to plate 100µL of each on M17Glucose+agar+Ery(10)</LI></UL><H1 class="date two">August 10th</H1><H2>Results of the OD test for G1513 made on the 7th of August:</H2>
The 10ml solution of G1513/water had an OD of 1,296.
Here is a table of what 100µL of each dilutions grew:
<TABLE style="width:25%" align="center"><TBODY><TR style="background-color:#E6E6E6"><TH>Dilution </TH><TH>Number of colonies</TH></TR><TR align="center"><TD>10<SUP>-1</SUP></TD><TD>381</TD></TR><TR align="center"><TD>10<SUP>-2</SUP></TD><TD>84</TD></TR><TR align="center"><TD>10<SUP>-3</SUP></TD><TD>11</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

We have, in average, 7,74x10<SUP>3</SUP> cells per ml of the 10<SUP>-1</SUP> dilution.
so: <B>1 A = 6,0x10<SUP>4</SUP> cells/ml</B><H2>Procedure</H2>
Today, we made new cubes containing Sc. mcherry and G1513 to calculate the survival rate.

<H1 class="date two">August 11th</H1><H2>Goal</H2>
While waiting for the cubes results, we are thinking about the next step: finding a media to grow the strains, easy to give to the population and to use afterward.
The perfect media would be an edible one, that we could incorporate to the cube, instead of the water.<H2>Material</H2><UL><LI>Culture of Sc. mcherry</LI><LI>3 potatoes</LI><LI>Rice flour</LI><LI>Geneticin, 100mg/ml</LI><LI>Osmosed water</LI><LI>Sterile eppendorf tubes and culture tubes</LI><LI>Sterile plates and beads</LI><LI>One glass bottle</LI></UL><H2>Procedure</H2>
We tried 2 different medium: potato juice and potato juice with rice flour.
For the potato juice:<UL><LI>Heat 3 potatoes in 750ml of water</LI><LI>Let the water boil (sterilisation)</LI><LI>Save the water and stock it in a bottle </LI><LI>Put 10ml of this potato water in a culture tube</LI><LI>Add 20μL of geneticin (100mg/ml)</LI><LI>Inoculate with Sc. mcherry</LI><LI>Put in the incubator at 30°C for 2 days</LI></UL>
For the mix potato juice with rice flour:<UL><LI>Put 5ml of the potato water made previously in a culture tube</LI><LI>Inoculate with Sc. mcherry</LI><LI>Add 20μL of geneticin (100mg/ml)</LI><LI>Add 5ml of rice flour</LI><LI>Put in the incubator at 30°C for 2 days</LI></UL><H1 class="date two">August 12th</H1><H2>Results of the cube tests made on the 10th of August</H2>
The yeasts survived well: 42%. 
(Seven days later, on the 19th of August, we plated cubes from this same test, and obtained a survival rate of 21%.)
But about the G1513, strangely, the number of cells in the plates of M17agar, which are supposed to be G1513,  is the same as in the plates with YPD and geneticin, selecting the yeasts.
Therefore, we checked the production of RFP, since Sc. mcherry produces RFP but not G1513.
Unfortunately, we came to the conclusion that the cells in the M17 plates were yeasts. Actually, Sc. mcherry resist to erythromycin and is therefore growing in the plate.<H2>Goal</H2>
We need a chemical that will allow us to select G1513 and kill Sc. mcherry.
After some researchs, we found out that cycloheximide could be helpful and ordered it. While waiting for this chemical, we can't work with G1513.

<H1 class="date two">August 13th</H1><H2>Results of the media test made on the 11th of August</H2>
Nothing grew on the potato juice media.
We had the idea of adding sugar, to see if it changes something.
The potato juice/rice flour media strongly smells yeasts. We therefore admit the yeast grew in this media but decided that the aspect wasn't very attractive and the smell so so bad that indian population would be disgusted and won't use it.

<H1 class="date two">August 17th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2>
Making new cubes with Sc. mcherry alone, G1513 alone, and a mix of both strains. 
Measuring the OD and plating to count the cells

<H2>Results of the media test made on the 13th of August</H2>
With sugar, we can see there are cells growing in the potato juice.
It's a very small growth compared to the one in YPD but it's still a growth.
We will work more precisely on this media, trying to deduce the influence of the potato and sugar concentration.


<H1 class="date two">August 18th</H1><H2>Results of the OD test made on the 17th of August</H2>
For Sc. mcherry:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 1,820.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution grew 70 colonies, so:<B>1 A = 3,8x10<SUP>6</SUP> cells/ml</B>

For G1513:
The 10ml solution of G1513/water had an OD of 1,521.

We kept samples of the mix in the fridge to be able to study it later, when we will have the cycloheximide.


<H1 class="date two">August 20th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2>
We made more cubes with Sc. mcherry alone, G1513 alone, and a mix of both.
We made more OD correlations.


<H1 class="date two">August 24th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2>
We made more cubes...<H2>Results of the OD test made on the 20th of August</H2>
For Sc. mcherry:
The 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 1,828.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-5</SUP> dilution grew 56 colonies, so:<B>1 A = 3,1x10<SUP>6</SUP> cells/ml</B>
For G1513:
Nothing...

The second 10ml solution of Sc. mcherry/water had an OD of 2,523.
100µL of the 10<SUP>-5</SUP> dilution grew 95 colonies.
so <B>1 A = 3,8x10<SUP>6</SUP> cells/mL</B>
For G1513:
Nothing... We used cells from the previous culture, wich was dead, so it seems normal.

It's a fail, there was almost only water in the well so nothing grew.
We will do it again, asking for a real protocol to our advisors, because obviously, there was a misunderstanding.


<H1 class="date three">September 4th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2> 
We tried the new method for the Tecan test.
This time, we did an overnight culture for each media and each strain, that we diluted 200times (till we get an OD smaller than 0,01)


<H1 class="date three">September 6th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2>
We made fresh new cultures of G1513 and Sc. mcherry.

<H1 class="date three">September 7th</H1><H2>Results of the Tecan test made on the 4th of September</H2> 
Third fail, because one parameter was changed and we didn't noticed: the Tecan measured the OD for only few hours, not enough to see the growth...

<H1 class="date three">September 8th</H1><H2>Procedure</H2> 
Today we used the fresh cultures we made on the 6th of August to make lots of new cubes and OD test.
After centrifugation, throwing the media and  replacing it by osmosed water, the cultures gave us two solutions:
<UL><LI>Solution X: 8,8x10<SUP>7</SUP> cells of Sc. mcherry per ml</LI><LI>Solution Y: 5,2x10<SUP>9</SUP> cells of G1513 per ml</LI></UL>

We made 3 different types of cubes: 
<UL><LI>Cubes Q: 15ml of rice flour, 6ml of osmosed water and 1ml of solution X</LI><LI>Cubes R: 15ml of rice flour, 5ml of osmosed water, 900μL of solution X and 1ml of solution Y</LI><LI>Cubes S: 15ml of rice flour, 6ml of osmosed water and 1ml of solution Y</LI></UL><TABLE style="width:100%; text-align:center"><TBODY><TR><TH>Strains and cubes</TH><TH>Total weight of the cubes (g)</TH><TH>Number of cells per g of cube</TH></TR><TR><TD>Sc. mcherry in Q cubes</TD><TD>13,30</TD><TD>6,6x10<SUP>6</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>Sc. mcherry in R cubes</TD><TD>13,39</TD><TD>5,9x10<SUP>6</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>G1513 in R cubes</TD><TD>13,39</TD><TD>3,9x10<SUP>8</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>Sc. mcherry in S cubes</TD><TD>10,70</TD><TD>4,8x10<SUP>8</SUP></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE> 

We are going to plate one cube of each kind each day and follow the survival rate during a week of drying. 

For the OD, here are the results we obtained (we obtained them on the 10th of August).
<TABLE style="width:100%; text-align:center"><TBODY><TR><TH>Studied strains</TH><TH>OD of the sample</TH><TH>Number of colonies in the 10<SUP>-3</SUP> dilution of the sample</TH><TH>Number of colonies in the 10<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution of the sample</TH><TH>Number of colonies in the 10<SUP>-5</SUP> dilution of the sample</TH></TR><TR><TD>Sc. mcherry</TD><TD>1,156</TD><TD>+++</TD><TD>347</TD><TD>23</TD></TR><TR><TD>G1513</TD><TD>0,392</TD><TD>+++</TD><TD>439</TD><TD>/</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

So, for Sc. mcherry:<B> 1A=2,5x10<SUP>7</SUP> cells/ml </B>
For G1513:<B> 1A=1,1x10<SUP>8</SUP> cells/ml </B><H1 class="date three">September 9th</H1>
We plated the first cubes today.
Everyday, we will follow the same protocol: 
<UL><LI>Weigh the cube</LI><LI>Dilute the cube in 10ml of osmosed water during 5min</LI><LI>Dilute the solution obtained 10<SUP>-1</SUP>, 10<SUP>-2</SUP> and 10<SUP>-3</SUP> times</LI><LI>Plate the dilutions</LI></UL>
This should only take 20min in total, doing it for all the cubes in the same time.
For more clarity, we will write the results for each cubes on the day we plated it (even if the colonies took 1 or 2 days to grow depending on the strains, so we only add the results 2 days after the plating).
