Almost no difference between the PCR and their corresponding negative control.
It could be the fallout of the limited number of cycles. (We only used 12 cycles, as advised by IDT)
NEB  Tm calculator gave really different Tm  for the PCR primers than Geneious and IDT.
We decided to launch two PCR, both with 35 cycles, but with two different annealing
temperature: 52 and 64°C.

After PCR, we ran the PCR products on a TAE - 1% agarose gel (100V, 20min) to check if the amplification product correspond to the expected size of the gBlocks.

From the left to the right:
1kb Ladder, RibA, D, E, T25 and T48 amplified at 52°C and Rib A, D, E, T25 and T48 amplified at 64°C
The bands are not really specific and seems to be smeared over the gel.
However, we can see that the extremity of each band correspond approximatively
to the expected size of our parts, except RibD amplified at 64°C for which no band has been detected.
We purified our PCR product according to the previously used protocol, and then measure the DNA concentration using a Nanodrop.

To prevent the transformation of the native pSIP411 (non-digested or re-circularized), we decided to PCR the 3kb fragment containing the ORI and the erythromycin resistance gene, digest it with SalI/XbaI, PCR purify it and then gel purify it.     This would give us only the fragment we want to ligate and thus prevent background transformants to appear.
For the PCR, o15.070(AAAAACCGCAGGGAGGCAAACAATGA) and o15.071(CGGATTAACGTTAAGAACTCTATTGAAGG) were used to amplify the 3 kb fragment, with an annealing temperature of 69°C (according to NEB Tm calculator) and an elongation time span of 2 minutes.
All the PCR purified products were allowed to run on an 1% agarose gel, and gel extraction was performed on the band of approximately of size 3kb, according to the following protocol.
Gel Extraction Protocol with QIAGEN kit
add three times the volume of QG solubilisation buffer with one volume (=mass) of gel extracted
incubate 10 minutes at 50°C, vortex every 2 or 3 minutes, until the gel is dissolved
transfer in a provided purification column, centrifuge 1 minute at 14000rpm then discard the filtrat
add 500µL of solubilisation buffer, centrifuge 1 minute at 14000rpm then discard the filtrat
add 750µL of washing buffer
centrifuge 1 minute at 14000rpm then discard the filtrat
add 500µL of washing buffer
centrifuge 1 minute at 14000rpm then discard the filtrat
centrifuge 1 minute at 14000rpm then discard the filtrat
put the column in a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
add 45µL of DNAse/RNAse free water right on the membrane of the column
wait a couple of minutes and then centrifuge 1 minute at 10000rpm
discard the column, DNA is saved in water

To get a fresher batch of annealed oligos, we decided to anneal them again, using the same protocol.     (o15.011+o15.012 and o15.072+o15.073).      The three minipreps from p15.01 transformants were sent to sequence thanks to GATC LightRun NightXpress service.
5µL (~100ng/µL) of all three minipreps were mixed with o15.097 (forward primer, CGGTAGAGCTCCCTTCTATGC) or o15.098 (reverse primer, CTGGCACGACAGGTTTCCC).

Miniprep of all the overnight cultures from clones of p15.06 and p15.07.
We did restriction digestion with Eco31I on p15.06 and p15.07 minipreped.
p15.06 and p15.07 restriction analysis should produce 6 fragments (first and second may be overlapping) (2.77, 2.7, 1.7, 1.3, 0.9 and 0.6 in kb size),
whereas p15.01 restriction analysis should only produce two fragments(2.7, 3.4 in kb size)

From left to right: p15.01 non digested, p15.01 digested, p15.06 (6 colonies), p15.07 (2 colonies), generuler 1kb, p15.07 (6 colonies)
All the digested products are presenting only two bands (and some bands likely to come from Eco31I star activity)us are not containing the four inserts.
We decided to perform an other golden gate/dialyse/transformation with p15.01, p15.06 and p15.07.
According to several advice we received, we tried two different golden gate protocols, the first one using the 2:1 insert:backbone ratio, the second using a 3:1 ratio.
Time constants for each electroporation was about 5.2 or 5.3 msec.
With two BbsI enzyme tubes present in our stock, we tested both (A and B).
After one hour of recovery, two volumes (50µL and 170 µL) of each transformed cells were plated on LB + ery (150µg/mL) and incubated overnight at 37°C.

No band was visible. Several explanations are possible:
Colony PCR failed
The colonies did not contain p15.01, p15.06 or p15.07, however the presence of colonies after transformation but none in the negative control suggests that at least the native plasmid has been transformed succesfully.
Thus, we decided to do the experiment again the next day.
August 6th
We performed again the colony PCR (with o15.097 and o15.098) on the same colonies with a different DreamTaq enzyme.      PCR analysis on 1% agarose 0.5X TAE gel.

Even when the gel quality is not really good, we observed a strange 8kb band in most of the wells and also in the negative insertion control. These results mean that the either the PCR failed or that the inserted plasmid is not the good one.
From these results, we decided to investigate the different tubes (3) of DreamTaq enzyme to look for a lost of function.
So, we did PCR on two of our gBlocks (RibE and T25) with the three different DreamTaqs (Extension time: 2.00min).
Then, to see whether the amplification worked or not, we run our PCR products on an 1% agarose gel.
Here is a picture of the gel after 20min at 100V:
Figure 5: PCR amplification using three DreamTaq mixes unraveled by electrophoresis
According to these results, we concluded that two among the three DreamTaqs did not work. It could explain why our precedent colony PCR failed miserably.
We launched overnight cultures (LB + ery 150µg/mL) of:
4 colonies of p15.07, BbsI #A, 3:1 ratio
4 colonies of p15.07, BbsI #B, 2:1 ratio
2 colonies of p15.06, BbsI #A, 3:1 ratio
4 colonies of p15.06, BbsI #B, 2:1 ratio
August 7th
Because of the poor digestion capacity we observed in BbsI, we investigated on the net if some other people had problems with the NEB BbsI enzyme. [This website: http://synbio.tsl.ac.uk/golden-gate-assembly-protocol/] explained that they detected that "BbsI supplied by NEB (an isoschizomer of BpiI) loses activity extremely quickly and has a lot of star-activity". Using this information, we thought about using BpiI instead of BbsI.
To confirm that BpiI would digest our plasmid the same way than BbsI, we digested p15.01 with BpiI to see if it would produce the same three bands than BbsI.
Figure 6 shows the electrophoresis result of p15.01 after digestion with Eco31I and BpiI:
Figure 6: Digestion of p15.01 with BpiI
The 3 expected bands (2.6, 1.7 and 1.4kb) are clearly visible, and no noisy band is detected at the same time, suggesting a low star activity. Thus, we decided to use BpiI to perform the next reactions.
Miniprep of the 14 overnight cultures and restriction analysis of their plasmid with BpiI and Eco31I.
Here is a simulation of an electrophoresis:

No well was showing the expected bands showing the insertion of the four gBlocks in the backbone.
All the wells were presenting various coiled variants of the backbone and the non-inserted digested backbone.

Negative control is constituted of a digested p15.01 with BpiI and ligated without any digested insert.
Instead of BbsI, we used BpiI.
3µL of each Golden Gate products were transformed in electrocompetent NEB turbo E.coli.
Cells were recovered one hour in LB at 37°C, and two volume (50µL and 170µL) were plated on LB + 150µg/mL of erythromycin.
To check whether the assembly is working or not, we ran a gel to see if the Golden Gate is producing some expected bands.
Here is a picture after 20 minutes of migration:

We performed a colony PCR on 8 colonies from p15.06 1:2, p15.07 1:2, p15.07 1:3 and 1 colony of p15.01 (from 04/08 transformation), using o15.097 and o15.098.
Instead of preparing ourselves the DreamTaq Mix, we used a 2X DreamTaq Master Mix, to which we only add both forward and reverse primers.
Cells were saved on Lb + ery (150 µg/mL).
Lyse was performed during 8 minutes, and elongation time span was extended to 3.3 minutes (instead of 6 - 1min/kb - human error...)

Elongation time span was extended to 3.30 minutes, and annealing was performed at 64°C.
Because of a human mistake, thermocycler lid was inverted, letting the caps oped themselves when temperature increased. The PCR products were lost.
Restriction digestion of p15.01 by BbsI or BpiI(Fast Digest), then by Eco31I.

August 11th
PCR amplification of RibA, RibD, RibE and both RibT, elongation time was extended to 2.30 minutes and annealing temperature was 64°C.
As the previous day, caps opened during the PCR because the thermocycler lid was inverted...
Second PCR amplification of Rib gblocks. Final volume was 100µL, elongation time was 2.30 minutes and annealing temperature was 64°C.
Electrophoresis was performed to check the gBlocks amplification.
Figure 12: Rib gblocks amplification (64°C annealing) checked by electrophoresis
From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibA - RibD - RibE - RibT25 - RibT48
It clearly appeared that something was wrong the amplification. Because of the absence of band for RibA and the double band for RibD, we decided to perform a third PCR using a lower annealing temperature (55°C).
Figure 13: Rib gblocks amplification (55°C annealing) control by electrophoresis
From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibA - RibD - RibE - RibT25 - RibT48
RibA, RibE and RibT48 were scarcely visible and RibD and RibT25 were presenting two bands.
Using the different gel pictues we had, we decided to perform a fourth PCR amplification using for each gBlock the annealing temperature which gave the brightest and the sharpnest bands.
For the amplification, we used the 60°C for RibA, RibD and RibT25, and 55°C for RibE and RibT48.
Preparation of electrocompetent NEB turbo, saved in 200µL aliquots at -80°C.

From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibA - RibD - RibE - RibT25 - RibT48
All the bands correspond to the expected size of the gBlocks, but RibA for which no band was visible.
Thus, we decided to perform a gradient PCR (five tubes spread from 52°C to 64°C) on RibA to determine what was the best (or a least a good) temperature for annealing.
Figure 15: RibA amplification checked by electrophoresis
From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibA (Tm=52) - RibA (Tm=55) -  RibA (Tm=58) - RibA (Tm=61) - RibA (Tm=64) -
According to these results, we assumed that the five gblocks were there.
PCR purification of the five gBlocks. For the multiple RibA, we purified them separately, giving four stocks of amplified gBlocks.
Digestion of p15.01 and the Rib gBlocks separately, with BpiI (final volume = 30µL, about 100ng of DNA per tube). The digestion products were then PCR purified to get rid of the enzymes.
August 13th
Ligation of p15.01 + RibA, RibD, RibE and RibT25 with 2:1 and 3:1 molarity ratio. Same for T48.
Each ligation mix contained 20ng of the backbone, for a final volume of 20µL.
Thus, the 2:1 mix contained 10ng of RibA, 12ng of RibD, 9ng of RibE and 6ng of RibT.
3:1 mix contained respectively 15, 13, 13 and 8ng of RibA, RibD, RibE and RibT.
All the ligation products were dialysed for 40 minutes.
Transformation by electroporation of the four ligation products and for both digested and undigested p15.01 (5µL ligation product in 200µL electrocompetent cells).
Time constant was 5.3 or 5.4 for all the transformations.
Cells were recovered 2 hours in LB and then plated on LB + ery 150µg/mL.
August 14th
Colony PCR of 15 colonies from each transformation. Annealing temperature was 64°C and elongation set to 3 minutes.

From left to right:
p15.01 (negative control) - 8 p15.07 (1:2) colonies - generuler 1kb - 7 p15.07 (1:2) colonies
On all the gels, but p15.06 1:3, one can clearly see that all the bands are about 600bp heavy, as the negative control of insertion (p15.01).
For p15.06 1:3, some bands are absent. After investigation, we figured out that the elongation time for the DreamTaq was 1kb/min instead of 30 seconds. Regarding to this information, we thought that maybe no band was visible because the insert was present but as the elongation time span was not long enough, the exponentially amplification could not work.
To control these results, we launched overnight cultures of the four colonies corresponding to the absent bands (1, 6, 7 and 9).
To obtain high yield of our five gBlocks, we performed a PCR using the optimal Tm we determined so far.
Figure 20: Rib gBlocks PCR amplification
From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibA - RibD - RibE - RibT25 - RibT48
Even with such an ugly gel (a very old stock of agarose was used), one can clearly see that four of the five gBlocks are correctly amplified. RibE expected size is 0.9kb, here an 1.5 and a 0.5 bands are visible.
To determine the optimal Tm for RibE amplification, we performed a gradient PCR from 55°C to 64°C.

One can clearly see that only the two first wells are showing really visible bands.
These two PCR products were PCR purified and saved for later use.

As this gel was not presenting any band and we were short in amplified gBlocks, we decided to amplify all of them again.
As several PCR on the lab (for different teams) were not working, we suspected that maybe some phusion MasterMixes were compromised.
Gradient PCR amplification (Tm from 52 to 65°C : 52 - 53 - 54.5 - 57 - 60 - 62.4 - 64 - 65°C) of RibD, RibE and both RibT. Two phusion MM were used to prevent a negative result due to nonfunctional phusion MasterMix. Elongation time was extended to 1.30 minutes.

Knowing that we finished the first phusion MasterMix for the seventh RibT25 PCR mix and used another one for the last RibT25 and for the eight RibT48, we suspected that the first MasterMix we used was not working anymore, and thus could explain these days PCR failures.
Result:
Sample plate with 200uL of recovered cells: ~45 colonies!
Control  plate with 200uL of (transformed with water) recovered cells: 0 colonies!

PCR amplification of RibD, RibE, RibT25 and RibT48 (two mix for each, 1µL of dNTPS was added to increase the yield, 50µL of mix per tube).
For annealing , we used respectively 60.5, 55, 64 and 62.2°C for RibD, RibE, RibT25 and RibT48.
Figure 28: Electrophoresis of Rib gBlocks PCR products
From left to right:
RibD x2 - RibE x2 - generuler 1kb - RibT25 x2 - RibT48 x2
All the amplification products were showing bands corresponding to their expected size, but RibD was again presenting a non specific amplification band.
Thus we decided to PCR RibD again with different annealing temperature (from 60 to 68°C, 7 tubes), 20µL total reaction volume, 1.30 minutes elongation.(overnight)
August 19th
RibD gradient PCR amplification was controled by electrophoresis.
Figure 29: Control of RibD gradient PCR amplification by Electrophoresis
From left to right:
generuler 1kb - 7x RibD
As a lot of PCR problems occurred at this period among the teams, the absence of band could be explained by the usage of a faulty phusion MasterMix.
We received at this point a new batch of phusion MasterMix, that we used for all the next PCRs.
PCR purification of RibE, RibT25 and ribT48 (amplified the 18/08).
Purification products were run on a 1% agarose gel to control their purity.

From left to right:
generuler 1kb - RibD x8 (52, 53, 54.5, 57, 60, 62.4, 64, 65)
Visible bands corresponded to the following annealing temperature: 57, 60, 62 and 64°C. A non expected band with a size of about 0.3kb was still observed. So we poured all of the volume left of this four PCR products on a gel a performed a gel extraction to only get the 1.3kb band.

19/08 RibD PCR amplification was run on a 1% agarose gel to allow the gel extraction of the 1.3kb band.

Digestion of all the available amplified gBlocks by BpiI. Digestion mix total volume was 50µL with 1µg of each gBlock (such quantity was maybe too much), digestion span was extended to 25 minutes to compensate the amount of DNA.
Digestion products were then PCR purified and saved for later use.
After purification, concentration of each gBlock was really low, so we ran them on a gel to confirm their presence.

The negative insertion control (p15.01) is not appearing, it was maybe due to a failure in the colony PCR protocol.
The visible bands on the four gels were corresponding to the size of a non inserted plasmid.
From these results, we concluded that the transformation did not worked (again...).
August 23rd
We wanted to check whether the gblocks could bind two by two, three by three and the four at the same time.
Each mix contained 1µL of the corresponding gBlock digested and purified (approximative concentration of each gBlock: 20ng/µL).
Ligation was performed as usually, for a final volume of 20µL.
After ligation, some ligation product was run on a 1% agarose TAE gel.

From Left to Right:
generuler 1kb - A+D - D+E - E+T25 - E+T48 - A+D+E - D+E+T - A+D+E+T
On the gel, we can see that that several binding are working correctly. For example, for A+D, we can distinguish two bands, the first measuring about 1.5kb corresponding to RibA, and a second one about 2.5 to 3kb, corresponding approximately to the expected size (2.8kb) after ligation of RibA and Ribd. This band is also slightly visible in all the ligation products containing RibA and RibD.
The ligation products were used as a DNA template for elongation to try to amplify the ligated gBlocks. This would help us to see which gBlock is correctly ligated and maybe to extract these PCR products and use them for transformation.
PCR was performed with DreamTaq MasterMix, with an elongation time extended to 6 minutes (the time required to amplify the RibADET ligation product), with an annealing temperature of 55°C.

Only the amplification of A+D worked, showing three bands (two faint and a more visible one). The two first were likely to be the result of the amplification of RibA and RibD, and the brightest band the amplification of the ligated product.
No other band was visible on the gel. This could be explained with the two following reasons:
-the annealing temperature of one and/or the two primer(s) was not allowing the binding
-the ligation did not work (overhangs were not good, ligation reaction did not work...).
We received the primers to biobrick the four genes (RibA, RibD, RibE and RibT), the two promoters (p25 and p48) and the terminator (Tdhl).
PCR amplification of the five gBlocks with respectively o15.027+o15.028, o15.029+o15.030, o15.031+o15.032, o15.033+o15.034 and o15.035+o15.034.
The promoters p25 and p48 were respectively amplified with o15.174+o15.175 and o15.172+o15.173.
Terminator Tdhl was amplified with o15.170+o15.171.
For amplification, was choose to perform a gradient PCR with four different annealing temperature: 70, 72, 73 and 74°C.
Elongation was extended to 1.30 minutes.

We so decided to use these amplification products to latter transform our cells with.

One colony of RibA (gel a - 4th well) and one of p25 (gel b - 5th band) seemed to present the expecting band after insertion.
We inoculated 2 tubes of 5mL LB + Cm 25µg/mL with the two colonies of RibA and p25. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37°C.
August 27th
Miniprep of the two overnight cultures of RibA and p25.
A sample of both miniprep were sent to sequence using o15.148 (TGCCACCTGACGTCTAAGAA, Forward sequencing ) or o15.149 (ATTACCGCCTTTGAGTGAGC, Reverse sequencing). These two primers are commonly used for pSB1C3 sequencing.
Colony PCR of 25/08 biobrick-amplified parts transformation. Four colonies of BB-RibA, BB-RibE, BB-RibT25, BB-RibT48, BB-p25 and BB-p48 were analysed.
PCR total volume was 20µL. Initial denaturation temperature step (95°C) was extended to 8 minutes to lyse the cells. Annealing temperature was 50°C and elongation time span was 2 minutes.
At this point as our previous assembly protocols did not work, so we tried to PCR amplify the four gBlocks after digestion and ligation of the four of them at the same time, using o15.027 (GTTTCTTCGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGgcgcccgaagacttatgc) and o15.034 (GTTTCTTCCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTAcagcagcatatgaagac), respectively the RibA forward and RibT reverse primers with the biobrick prefix/suffix.

August 28th
Sequencing results indicated that p25 was not present in pSB1C3.
For the sequencing of BB-RibA, the sequencing was indicating that a huge part of the CDS was there without SNPs, but the other part was really noisy and presenting a lot of differences with the theoretical sequence.
We troubleshot the golden gate protocol we used with an INSERM U1001 member, Antoine Decrulle.
He gave us the following protocols that he was using at this time, his positive control and the enzymes he was using.
From the results we get so far, two steps could explain the failures: digestion and ligation.
Several points have been improved: using a High Concentration Ligase (T4 DNA ligase HC from Promega, #M1794) and adding some purified BSA (100X BSA, NEB, #B9000S).
We also used two different protocols:
-using the digestion buffer (G buffer 10x, Fermentas, #BG5)
-using the ligation buffer coming with the HC ligase.
So, when we refer to p15.06 L (or p15.07 L), one should understand p15.06 (or p15.07) assembled with the Ligase buffer protocol (same for p15.06 or p15.07 G).
Golden gate assembly with G buffer
Prepare the following mix:
0.4µL of BpiI
0.2µL of Promega Ligase HC
1µL of BSA 10X
1µL of G buffer 10X
1µL of DTT(10mM)
1µL of ATP(10mM)
40 fmol of backbone
40 fmol of each insert
up to 10µL of water
Use the following digestion/ligation cycles:
37°C, 5minutes (digestion)
20°C, 5 minutes (ligation)
repeat 50 times the two steps above
50°C, 10 minutes
80°C, 10 minutes
Golden gate assembly with L buffer

We performed the golden gate assembly of p15.06 and p15.07 using both L and G protocols.
Positive control was constituted of the pL2 backbone and of two inserts, pele1 and eYFP. The backbone is expressing LacI constitutively. In presence of IPTG, LacI loose its ability to inhibit the pLac promoter and allow the expression the protein promoted by pLac.
August 29th
Dialyse and transformation of the Golden Gate products.
Dialyse was performed for 15 minutes and 5µL of each Golden gate product were added to 50µL of electrocompetent cells.
Cells were recovered 2 hours in LB, plated on LB + ery (p15.01, p15.06, p15.07, negative growth control) or LB+Cm+IPTG+Xgal (pL2) and incubated at 37°C.
As we were craving for results, we launched a second Golden Gate assembly on the same products, using again both G and L protocols.

The negative control amplification did not work, but one can clearly see that in between the 0.5kb bands we were used to see, a     band of about 4.5kb is visible, which corresponded to the expected size of the amplification in case the insertion worked. But let's not be hasty, and let's wait for the sequencing results.
The corresponding colonies (saved during the colony PCR) were restriked on LB + ery(150µg/mL) and incubated overnight.

One or two single colonies of each suspected colony were inoculated in 5mL of LB + ery(150µg/mL) for 7 hours. 4mL of each culture were miniprep.
Two miniprep of p15.06 G colony 4 were sent to sequence with the following gBlocks: o15.097 (CGGTAGAGCTCCCTTCTATGC), o15.110 (CAACACCGATAGCACCAACG), o15.112(CCACCGAAACGACCGTTAGC), o15.114(GCATGTACTTCAGCGTGTGC) and o15.116(CTTCAGGAGTTGCATGTTCAGC). This colony was the more likely to contain the insert, so we sequenced all the binding points in between the backbone and the gBlocks.
One miniprep of p15.06 G colony 1 and two miniprep of p15.07 L colony 1 and 2 were sent to sequence with o15.097 and o15.116 to check the binding between p15.01/RibA and RibT/p15.01.

Colony PCR failed for an unknown reason. We so launched a PCR for RibD to check the 3 Phusion MM and 1 DreamTaq MM.
Denaturation temperature was set to 98°C for Phusion and 95°C for DreamTaq. Annealing was performed at 60 °C for Phusion and 50°C for DreamTaq, and elongation time span was 1:30 minutes and 2 minutes.

From Left to Right:

Seeing the results, we conclude that Phusion 2 and 3 were corrupted, as well as DreamTaq.
The MM we used for the previous colony PCR was corrupted.
September 1st
Colony PCR of 29/08 transformation. Eight colonies of both p15.06 L and G and both p15.07 L and G were used.
PCR total volume was 20µL. Initial denaturation temperature step (95°C) was extended to 8 minutes to lyse the cells. Annealing temperature was 64°C and elongation time span was 6 minutes.

On both gels, one can clearly see that some wells are containing several bands, we decided to investigate this behaviour (maybe an inserted transformant was picked at the same time as a non-inserted transformant).
So, we inoculated the corresponding colonies (p15.06 G 3, 4 and 8, p15.07 G 2, 5 and 6) in 5mL Lb + agar + ery(150µg/mL).
Colony PCR of 25/08 biobrick-amplified parts transformation with o15.148 and o15.149.
Four colonies of BB-RibA, BB-RibE, BB-RibT25, BB-RibT48, BB-p25 and BB-p48 were analysed.
PCR total volume was 20µL. First high temperature step (95°C) was extended to 8 minutes to lyse the cells. Annealing temperature was 50°C and elongation time span was 2 minutes.

These results are all negative, as the expected size of a non-inserted amplification is about 0.3kb.
Maybe more colonies should be screened to get an inserted transformant.
We performed an electrophoresis on the 31/08 miniprep undigested to get an estimation about the size of the plasmid.

The gel is showing three bands with a size of approximately 10 to 20kb.
p15.06 and p15.07 are about 10kb long, so the visible bands could correspond to p15.06 and p15.07.
Moreover, on two plates containing the re-striking of the colonies used for the colony PCR, a really visible yellow dye was appearing around colonies.
(Riboflavin appears yellow, just sayin')

Second colony PCR of 25/08 biobrick-amplified parts transformation with o15.148 and o15.149. Eight colonies of BB-RibA, BB-RibE, BB-RibT25, BB-RibT48, BB-p25 and BB-p48 were analysed.
PCR total volume was 20µL. Initial denaturation temperature step (95°C) was extended to 8 minutes to lyse the cells. Annealing temperature was 50°C and elongation time span was 2 minutes.
RibD PCR amplification with Biobrick prefix and suffix primers (respectively o15.029 and o15.030).
As the amplification failed previously, we decided to test a broader range of annealing temperatures.
NEB Tm calculator indicated that for the binding of the two primers (without their tail), an annealing temperature of 50°C is required. So we tried with 8 different temperatures from 48°C to 58°C. Elongation time span was set to 1.30 minutes.

The expected size of a non inserted pSB1C3 amplification band with o15.182 and o15.183 is 0.3kb.
Most of the wells are presenting a 0.3kb band, meaning that those colonies did not receive an inserted plasmid.
However, on the first well of BB-RibA (gel a), one can see two bands above the 0.3kb band. These bands are not the result of a RibA insertion (RibA insertion amplification band should be about 1.7kb), but more probably the results of a primer off-binding.
On the 8th well of BB-RibT25, a 0.9kb band is clearly visible, corresponding to the expected size of BB-RibT25 insertion in pSB1C3. The corresponding colony was striked on LB + Cm(25µg/mL) and incubated at 37°C overnight.
Once more, no transformant containing BB-RibE, BB-RibT48, BB-p25 or BB-p48 were found.
RibD gradient PCR amplification was with BB-tailed primers was analysed by electorphoresis.

One can clearly see that none of the amplification worked. These results could have been caused by a non working Phusion MM (again...) or because the annealing temperature was not good.
Miniprep of p15.06 L colonies 6 and 8, p15.06 G colonies 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, p15.07 G colonies 2, 3, 5 and 6.
The miniprep results were anaylsed by electrophoresis.

Seeing these results, we decided to perform an analytical digestion on those plasmids (200ng of DNA) with Eco31I.

From the digestion, it appeared that p15.06 G 5 and 6 and p15.07 G 2, 3, 5, 6 were presenting the expected profile after insertion. At least the two brightest bands were visible, and the three other one were slightly visible or unvisible.
We plated the corresponding colonies on LB + ery(150µG/mL) and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Sequencing results from 31st of August did not give us any conclusive results of RibA, ribD, ribE and ribT’s insertion in p15.06 and p15.07 plasmids. As some primers gave confirmation of some of the inserts but some primers did not gave us any results at all, which may be due to off binding effect of the primers.

Striking of the BB-RibT25 #8 on LB + Cm (25µg/mL).
Seeing the poor results sequencing gave us, we decided to try whether the primers we were using were binding well or not.
Also, as the 08/02 BB-RibD gradient PCR did not work, we decided to perform the PCR with both DreamTaq and Phusion.

As we were expecting small bands, we used generuler 100bp and a 2% agarose gel. However, as you'll see right below.

From Left to Right:
Mix 1 - Mix 2 - Mix 3 - Mix 4 - Mix 5 - generuler 100bp - Mix 1 - Mix 2 - Mix 3 - Mix 4 - Mix 5
These results indicated us that some of the primers were not binding at the expected temperature (and that once again, the Phusion MasterMix was not working...).
It also indicate that two of the couple of primers (couples 3 and 4) were binding well on the plasmid, however the sequencing results with the same plasmid and the forward primer of the couple number 3 (o15.105) gave a 0bp sequence. It showed that this primer is correctly binding and the negative sequencing result was not due to o15.105.
Restriction digestion of pSB1C3 (3µg) with FD XbaI, FD BcuI (SpeI isoschizomer from ThermoScientific) and FastAP.
The 2kb band of pSB1C3 was then gel extracted, purified and saved in water.

Electrocompetent NEB Turbo (electroporated without any DNA) were used as a negative control.
Positive control was constituted by NEB Turbo transformed with pSB1C3.
Dialysis was performed for 15 minutes, and 5µl of each dialysis product was transformed is 50µL of NEB Turbo electrocompetent cells.
Cells were recover in LB for 1 hour and then plated on LB+ Cm(25µg/mL).

These results were showing that the Master Mix, for once, was working well, but the three first wells were showing no band, but the wells with an annealing temperature above 60°C were presenting bands. However, the visible band is not the expected size.     We were expecting a 1.6kb band, an we only got a 0.4kb band.
So we simulate on geneious the binding of our primers allowing mismatches

As pSB1C3 was gel purified, it was unexpected to see a red colony. The small amount of colonies might be due to the fact taht the cells stayed a long time in ice before being saved at -80°C.

generuler 1kb - pSB1C3 digested
One can clearly see that something wrong happened during the digestion. As we changed XbaI for EcoRI from the previous digestion, we suspected that EcoRI was maybe sensitive to methylation of was not working.
Thus, we decided to use XbaI instead of EcoRI, even if it could allow a recircularization of the plasmid (because of XbaI and SpeI compatible overhangs).
PCR amplification of the two p15.06 and the four p15.07 presenting the four genes inserted with o15.027+o15.034 to BioBrick the four genes at the same time. Annealing was performed at 50°C and elongation was set to 2.45 minutes. RibT25+o15.033+o15.034 was used as a positive control.

It appeared that none of the amplification (even the positive control) worked.
Once more, we assumed that either the master mix was wrong or something prevented the PCR to work as expected.

Sequencing results of p25 showed that none of the suspect transformants contained the BioBrick. However, one transformant of p48 was presenting the promoter without any SNP.
Sequencing results of p15.07 G2 and G5 were not exploitable. Among the 12 sequences we were expecting to get, only two were longer than 0bp (52 and 46bp long...).
Analysis of the ab1 files showed that the signal was not specific, indicating that either the miniprep solution were not pure, or that the primers are binding at several places.

After gel purification, the three linear plasmids were ligated, dialysed and then transformed in electrocompetent STBL3 E. coli.
100µL of cells were transformed with all the ligation product (about 10µL), because the DNA concentration after gel extraction was really low.
Cells were recovered to hours in LB at 37°C and then plated on LB+ery (150µg/mL).

After gel purification, the purified product was PCR again with the same oligos in the same conditions to increase its concentration.
Lactococcus lactis MG1363 was grow in LB and in Idli water to obtain growth information.
In order to measure the amount of riboflavin released in the media by the cells, we took the four E. coli strains producing a bright yellow dye and inoculate them in LB+ery (150µg/mL) or M9 + ery(150µg/mL).
At the same time, we add riboflavin at different concentration in LB, M9 and water +ery (150µg/mL) to create a standard curve (0.05, 0.0725, 0.100, 0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.20µg/mL).
A non producing E.coli was also sowed in Lb and M9 +ery(150µg/mL).
The cells and the riboflavin solutions were incubated at 37°C.
September 17th
LB, M9 and water containing different concentration of riboflavin were excited at 440nm and the light emitted at 565nm was measured. Fluorescence measures increased from about 80 to about 4300 in water and M9, and from 16000 to 21000 a.u..
Increasing was nicely linear for M9 and water and somehow linear for LB.
M9 and LB cultures of p15.06 G5, G6 and p15.07 G2 and G5 were centrifuged 10 minutes at 6000rpm.
Fluorescence of the supernatant and of the three first 10 fold serial dilutions were measured.
The non diluted supernatant returned a fluorescence 10 times higher than the highest fluorescence we get from the scale.
The first ten-fold dilution returned a fluorescence slightly above the more concentrated solution of the dyeset.
This virtual equality allowed us to approximately estimate the concentration of vitamin B2 in the supernatant.
The highest concentration of the dyeset was 0.2µg/mL. Thus, the estimated concentration of riboflavin in the supernatant was about 2µg/mL.
From this experiment, we decided to launch again the same king of experiment, but without forgetting to launch the negative control (Media + riboflavin non-producer E.coli), without using LB (the background of fluorescence is really high in this media and could alter the measurement) and making technical and biological replicates (respectively 8 an 4).
