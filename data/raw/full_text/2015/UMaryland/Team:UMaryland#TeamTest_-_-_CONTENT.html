</SPAN></A><UL><DIV id="cover"><DIV id="bar"><P style="font-size:42px;"><B>Meet the team</B></P><P style="font-size:24px;">The UMaryland iGEM Team consists of 15 undergraduate students in the University, all from various science backgrounds.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="wholeteam"><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B style="font-size:24;">Iowis Zhu: </B>
President, Fearless Leader
<P style="font-size:12px;float:left;">4th year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Public Leadership, Statistics, Tech. Entrepreneurship
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;No worries, it'll be fine.&quot;</I><P>After leading last year's inaugural iGEM team to a gold award last year, Iowis returned this year to further grow the team. Outside of iGEM, he studies the characteristics of DNA looping protein in Dr. Kahn's lab. He has had the entire periodic table memorized since 8th grade. Outside of lab, he loves reading manga, watching sports (as a Boston sports fan), and following the global politics. He recently visited India last winter and Germany last summer. After graduation he plans to enter MD/PhD program.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B style="font-size:24;">Stephanie Sansbury: </B>
Vice President, Team Mom
<P style="font-size:16;">4th year: Microbiology, Arabic Studies
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;I'm gonna science as hard as I can!&quot;</I><P>Stephanie is a senior at the University of Maryland researching mechanosensitive channels in V. cholerae. When she's not in the lab, you can find her wandering organic farms trying to find my spirit animal or exploring the rocky paths of the local Billy Goat Trail along the Potomac River. In addition to basic scientific research, she is interested in science education and policy and plans to work in that arena after earning her PhD.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B>Kevin Fan: </B>Finance Director, Tallest Asian
<P style="font-size:16;">4th year: Neurobiology, Technology Entrepreneurship
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;Can I eat that?&quot;</I><P>Standing at 190 cm, Kevin is the tallest Asian on the team. He joined iGEM because of its fast-paced, multidisciplinary, problem solving nature, as well as its connections to entrepreneurship. He is the founder of SuperScore Inc, and serves on the national board of Kids Are Scientists Too. He hopes to attain a MD/MBA someday. In his spare time, Kevin enjoys boxing, parkour, and reading.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B style="font-size:24;">Robert Hand: </B>Community/Outreach Director
<P style="font-size:16;">3rd year: Bioengineering
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;Always happy to lend a hand.&quot;</I><P>Rob is currently a junior bioengineering major. He joined iGEM because of its innovative, creative nature and how it addresses so many different aspects of synthetic biology. Outside of the iGEM lab and our human practices efforts, he enjoys reading about virtually anything, learning about vegetarian cooking recipes, being out in nature,  exploring my new found hobby of SCUBA diving with the Maryland Terrafins, exploring, learning about issues in Bioethics, and spending time with his wonderful friends.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B style="font-size:24;">Chun Mun Loke: </B><FONT>Website Director, Best Kohai</FONT><P style="font-size:16;">2nd year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Physics, Music
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;Has Iowis-senpai noticed me yet?&quot;</I><P>Hailing from Singapore and Australia, Chun Mun's strong interest in genetic engineering prompted him to join iGEM. He hopes to conduct research in this field after attaining an MD/PhD. Outside of school, he is a self proclaimed piano prodigy, having won consecutive local competitions and finalising in international ones. He can solve a Rubik's cube in a very slow average of 17 seconds and is an avid video gamer. He is actually not a weeaboo as some aspects of his profile may suggest.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="teammember"><DIV id="personname"><B style="font-size:24;">Aditya Biswas: </B>PCR Design Director
<P style="font-size:16;">4th year: Bioengineering
</P></DIV><DIV id="personbio"><I>&quot;My PCR machine doubles as a hairdryer.&quot;</I><P>Aditya is a senior at the University of Maryland who is studying Bioengineering. Aditya brings 5 years of wet lab research experience including one prior year with Maryland's IGEM team. This year Aditya's main project is in the design of a cheap and effective PCR machine, and modeling metabolic pathways of engineered E.coli. In his free time Aditya enjoys the movies, making food for the team, and visiting cows.
