All Parts
A composite part is a biobrick made from simpler biobricks,
Miraculin Generator
Combines BBa_K206000 (pBAD promoter) with BBa_K1033120 (B0034-ExpTag-Linker-Miraculin-Linker-6xHis). Codes for a His-tagged miraculin with export tag to periplasm. Induced with arabinose. Miraculin is a protein that interacts with our taste receptors, causing us to taste sour foods as sweet. This part was assembled using 3A Assembly as a training exercise for new UMaryland iGEM members.
Constitutive Unstable RFP
Complete with a constitutive promoter, this fluorescent protein is expressed continuously in the cytoplasm. Due to the presence of a LVA degradation tag, this protein is subject to rapid targeting via proteases, with a half life of about 1 hour.
Constitutive Unstable RFP under Hok-Sok Regulation
This part combines two of our previous parts: Hok-Sok TA cassette and Constitutive Unstable RFP. This testing device was used to measure the ability of the Hok-Sok maintenance system to force cells to retain plasmids. The presence of Hok-Sok adjacent to the constitutive promoter for unstable RFP was found to interfere with RFP production in a minor way.
