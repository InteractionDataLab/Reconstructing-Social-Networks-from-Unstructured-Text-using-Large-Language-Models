Miniprep
Materials:
- 250 µL Buffer P1
- 250 µLBuffer P2
- 350 µL Buffer N3
- 750 µL Buffer PE
- 100 µL DDH2O
Procedure:
- Pellet 1 mL bacterial overnight culture 5 times ( using a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube) by centrifugation at max speed (13000 rpm) for 60 secs room temperature (15 - 25)
- Resuspend pellet in 250 µL Buffer P1
- Add 250 µLBuffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until solution becomes clear
- Do not allow reaction to proceed for more than 5 mins
- If using Lyse Blue, reagent, solution will turn blue
- Add 350 µL Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times
- Centrifuge for 10 mins at 13000 rpm
- Apply 800 µLsupernatant from step 5 to Q1A prep 2.0 spin column by pipetting
- Centrifuge for 60 secs and discard flow through
- Wash the Q1A prep column with 750 µL Buffer PE
- Centrifuge for 60 secs and discard flow through
- Centrifuge for 60 secs to remove residual wash buffer
- To elute DNA, add 50 µL DDH2O to the center of Q1A prep column
- Let stand for 1 min and centrifuge for 1 min
- Repeat steps 12 and 13
Ligation
Materials:
- 2 µL PSBIA3 digest
- 2 µL upstream digest (pBAD/ sRNBC)
- 2 µLdownstream digest (miraculin / const_GFP)
- 1 µL T4 DNA ligase
- 2 µL T4 DNA ligase 10x rxn buffer
Procedure:
- Combine reagents in a clean PCR tube
- Let stand 10 mins at room temperature/ no heat kill
Transformation
Materials:
- 50 µL cells (DH5alpha)
- 2 µL DNA
Procedure:
- Add DNA to cells
- Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
- Heat shock at 42°C fro 30 seconds
- Add 1 mL SOC media to the cells
- Incubate for 60 minutes at 37°C
- Plate 200 µL
- Incubate at 37°C
3A Assembly
Materials:
- 5 µL CutSmart
- 0.5 µL BSA
- 0.5 µL upstream digest (DH5alpha)
- 0.5 µL downstream digest
- Add DDH2O to 20 µL
Procedure:
- Combine reagents in a PCR tube
- Place in the thermocycler
- 37°C for 30 minutes
- 80°C for 20 minutes
RE Digest
Materials:
- 1 µg DNA
- 5 µL 10X NEBuffer
- Add DDH2O to 20 µL
Procedure:
- Combine reagents in a PCR tube
- Incubate for 1 hour
Gibson Assembly
Materials:
- 0.02-0.5 pmols of DNA
- 10 µL Gibson Assembly MasterMix (2X)
- Add DDH2O to 20 µL
Procedure:
- Combine reagents in a PCR tube
- Place tube in thermocycler for 15 minutes at 50°C
PCR
Materials:
- 4 µL Phusion HF/GC Buffer
- 0.4 µL 10 mM dNTPs
- 1 µL 10 µM forward primer
- 1 µL 10 µM forward primer
- 0.2 µL Phusion DNA polymerase
- (OPTIONAL) 0.6 µL DMSO
- <250 ng Template DNA
- Add DDH2O to 20 µL
Procedure:
- Combine reagents in a PCR tube
- Place tube in thermocycler for:
- Initial Denaturation: 98° C for 30 seconds
- 25-35 cycles: 98°C for 5-10 seconds, 45-72°C for 10-30 seconds and 72°C for 15-30 seconds per kb
- Final Extension: 72°C
- Hold 4-10°C
Gel Extract
Procedure:
- Cut out gel portions with scalpel
- Weigh gel slice in colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of QG buffer to 1 volume of gel
- Incubate at 50 for 10 mins until gels slice dissolves. Mix by vortexing tube every 2-3 mins during incubation to help the gel dissolve
- After the gel dissolves completely, check color of the mixture is yellow (it may be orange or violet)
- Add 10 µL of 3M sodium acetate (ph 5.0) to make solution more yellow (regardless of current solution color)
- The color of solution relates to ph indicator in Q3
- Add 1 gel volume of of isopropyl to the sample and mix. This increases yield of DNA fragments between 500 bp and 4KB
- Place a Q1Aquick spin column in a provided 2ml collection tube
- Apply sample to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min to bind dna
- Discard flow through
- Wash with .75 mL buffer PE in column, centrifuge 1 minute
- Place column in a clean 1.5 microcentrifuge tube
- 40 microliters DDH20 , let stand 1 minute, centrifuge 1 min
