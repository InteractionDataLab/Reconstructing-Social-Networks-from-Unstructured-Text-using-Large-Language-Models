Meet the team
The UMaryland iGEM Team consists of 16 undergraduate students with a variety of backgrounds.
Iowis Zhu: President, Fearless Leader
4th year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Public Leadership, Statistics, Tech. Entrepreneurship
"No worries, it'll be fine."
After leading last year's inaugural iGEM team to a gold award last year, Iowis returned this year to further grow the team. Outside of iGEM, he studies the characteristics of DNA looping protein in Dr. Kahn's lab. He has had the entire periodic table memorized since 8th grade. Outside of lab, he loves reading manga, watching sports (as a Boston sports fan), and following the global politics. He recently visited India last winter and Germany last summer. After graduation, he plans to enter MD/PhD program.
Stephanie Sansbury: Vice President, Team Mom
4th year: Molecular Genetics, Arabic Studies
"I'm gonna science as hard as I can!"
Steph is a senior at the University of Maryland researching mechanosensitive channels in bacteria. When she's not in the lab, you can find her wandering organic farms trying to find her spirit animal or exploring the rocky paths of the local Billy Goat Trail. After earning a Ph.D. in molecular/evolutionary genetics, Steph hopes to head a lab at a research institution.
Kevin Fan: Finance Director, Tallest Asian
4th year: Physiology & Neurobiology, Technology Entrepreneurship
"Can I eat that?"
Standing at 190 cm, Kevin is the tallest Asian on the team. He joined iGEM because of its fast-paced, multidisciplinary, problem solving nature, as well as its connections to entrepreneurship. He is the founder of SuperScore Inc., and serves on the national board of Kids Are Scientists Too. He hopes to attain a MD/MBA someday. In his spare time, Kevin enjoys boxing, parkour, and reading.
Robert Hand: Community/Outreach Director
3rd year: Bioengineering
"Always happy to lend a hand."
Rob is currently a junior Bioengineering major. He joined iGEM because of its innovative, creative nature and how it addresses so many different aspects of synthetic biology. Outside of the iGEM lab and our human practices efforts, he enjoys reading about virtually anything, learning about vegetarian cooking recipes, being out in nature,  exploring his new found hobby of SCUBA diving with the Maryland Terrafins, exploring, learning about issues in Bioethics, and spending time with his wonderful friends.
Chun Mun Loke: Website Director, Best Kohai
2nd year: Biochemistry, Molecular Genetics, Physics, Music
"Has Iowis-senpai noticed me yet?"
Hailing from Singapore and Australia, Chun Mun's strong interest in genetic engineering prompted him to join iGEM. He hopes to conduct research in this field after attaining an MD/PhD. Outside of school, he is a self proclaimed piano prodigy, having won consecutive local competitions and finalizing in international ones. He can solve a Rubik's cube in a very slow average of 17 seconds and is an avid video gamer. He is actually not a weeaboo as some aspects of his profile may suggest.
Aditya Biswas: PCR Design Director
4th year: Bioengineering
"My PCR machine doubles as a hairdryer."
Aditya is a senior at the University of Maryland who is studying Bioengineering. Aditya brings five years of wet lab research experience including one prior year with Maryland's iGEM team. This year, Aditya's main foci are the design of an inexpensive and effective PCR machine and modeling metabolic pathways of engineered E.coli. In his free time, Aditya enjoys the movies, making food for the team, and visiting cows.

She hopes to attend medical school after graduation to become either a dermatologist or an oncologist. Outside of school, she enjoys reading, dancing, and binge watching countless crime and cooking shows. Her favorite movie of all time is Finding Nemo, and her favorite food is macaroni and cheese (or just cheese in general!).
Kara Huie: PCR Design
2nd year: Bioengineering
"Get your lemonade and pink lemonade here!" (Referring to liquid cell culture with & without RFP)"
Kara is a sophomore Bioengineering major at the University of Maryland. While at this point in time she isn't sure what exactly she plans to do in the future, she hopes that experiences like iGEM will help her to find her interests and give her more exposure to the many careers related to biology. Outside of school, she enjoys running and keeping up with track & field. She also enjoys doing kung fu (martial arts) and just recently started indoor rock climbing this summer. Basically, she loves doing sports.
Dylan Taylor: PCR Design
2nd year: Physiology & Neurobiology, Mathematics
"This looks safe, right?"
Dylan is a sophomore Physiology & Neurobiology and Mathematics double major in the Integrated Life Sciences honors program. Dylan was heavily involved in the design of various components of the team’s PCR machine. He's not sure what he wants to do out of college yet, and he hopes his experience with iGEM will help shape this decision. This is his second research experience and first wet-lab experience. Outside iGEM, he is a member of the University of Maryland Gymkana Troupe, a performance gymnastics team. He also collects and solves various twisty puzzles and loves to read Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels.
