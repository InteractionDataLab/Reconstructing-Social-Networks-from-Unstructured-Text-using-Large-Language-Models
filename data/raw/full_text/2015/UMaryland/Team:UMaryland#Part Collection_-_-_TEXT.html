Name
Function
Part Type
K1783000
pBAD-RBS-Tagged-Miraculin
Makes miraculin containing a transport tag for proper folding and a his-tag for purification
Composite
K1783001
Hok/Sok
Type I Toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, naturally used to maintain plasmids
Composite
K1783002
Constitutive unstable RFP
RFP under a constitutive promoter, with half life of 1 hour
Basic
K1783003
Hok-Sok+CU-RFP
Constitutive unstable RFP, under Hok-Sok regulation. Used as part of tests of Hok-Sok's ability to retain plasmids
Composite
K1783004
ε-cyclase
Converts lycopene into α-carotene
Basic
K1783005
ε-hydroxylase
Adds hydroxyl group to ε ring
Basic
Miraculin Generator
Combines BBa_K206000 (pBAD promoter) with BBa_K1033120 (B0034-ExpTag-Linker-Miraculin-Linker-6xHis). Codes for a His-tagged miraculin with export tag to periplasm. Induced with arabinose. Miraculin is a protein that interacts with our taste receptors, causing us to taste sour foods as sweet. This part was assembled using 3A Assembly as a training exercise for new UMaryland iGEM members.
Hok/Sok Type I Toxin-Antitoxin Cassette
Codes for the Hok-Sok Type I toxin-antitoxin system. This system naturally evolved in bacteria as a method to maintain plasmids. Hok-Sok is noted for its presence on the R1 plasmid, which contains genes that confer antibiotic resistance. Hok-Sok is believed to be used to maintain these plasmids in the absence of antibiotic.
Constitutive Unstable RFP
Complete with a constitutive promoter, this fluorescent protein is expressed continuously in the cytoplasm. Due to the presence of a LVA degradation tag, this protein is subject to rapid targeting via proteases, with a half life of about 1 hour.
Constitutive Unstable RFP under Hok-Sok Regulation
This part combines two of our previous parts: Hok-Sok TA cassette and Constitutive Unstable RFP. This testing device was used to measure the ability of the Hok-Sok maintenance system to force cells to retain plasmids. The presence of Hok-Sok adjacent to the constitutive promoter for unstable RFP was found to interfere with RFP production in a minor way.
Epsilon Cyclase
Epsilon cyclase from the A. thaliana genome is capable of converting lycopene to gamma-carotene. A transport tag for the chloroplast at the N-terminus has been removed and the coding sequence has been codon-optimized for E. coli.
Epsilon Hydroxylase
Epsilon cyclase from the A. thaliana genome is capable of converting alpha-carotene to alpha-cryptoxanthin. A transport tag for the chloroplast at the N-terminus has been removed and the coding sequence has been codon-optimized for E. coli.
