Basic Parts
This page contains just the basic parts we made. Click below to see all our parts.
All Parts
A basic part is a biobrick that is not made of any other biobricks.
Hok/Sok Type I Toxin-Antitoxin Cassette
Codes for the Hok-Sok Type I toxin-antitoxin system. This system naturally evolved in bacteria as a method to maintain plasmids. Hok-Sok is noted for its presence on the R1 plasmid, which contains genes that confer antibiotic resistance. Hok-Sok is believed to be used to maintain these plasmids in the absence of antibiotic.
Epsilon Cyclase
Epsilon cyclase from the A. thaliana genome is capable of converting lycopene to gamma-carotene. A transport tag for the chloroplast at the N-terminus has been removed and the coding sequence has been codon-optimized for E. coli.
Epsilon Hydroxylase
Epsilon cyclase from the A. thaliana genome is capable of converting alpha-carotene to alpha-cryptoxanthin. A transport tag for the chloroplast at the N-terminus has been removed and the coding sequence has been codon-optimized for E. coli.
