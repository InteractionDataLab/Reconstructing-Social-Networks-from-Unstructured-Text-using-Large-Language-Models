Collaboration
"Creating a better world requires team work, partnership and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the most few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another"
As the statement suggest, iGEM allows every team to join hands with other teams to benefit each other. Apparently our team had united with the following teams:
Aachen is a research university of technology located in Germany. Our team had collaborated with them through a formal meetup with one of their team members and also by filling their "TUBEFRONT" survey which is based on Safety Organisation.
Uppsala university is the research university in Uppsala, Sweden.One member of the Uppsala team did her undergraduate from  our college and when she came to vacation here she came to know that we are participating in iGEM and this is our first endeavor in iGEM. She met us and discussed about iGEM and shared her thoughts with us. We decided to collaborate and once she returned to Sweden we were in regular contact through Skype meetings and email conversation and they gave their suggestions regarding our project. We filled their team survey forms for policy and practices and we gave them our survey forms for doctors to get the expert opinion.
Bettencourt team claimed us to fill their "FOOD SURVEY" form required for their survey which led to their collaboration with us.
Lets talk!
