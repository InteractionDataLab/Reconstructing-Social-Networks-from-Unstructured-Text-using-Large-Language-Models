INDUSTRY VIEWS:
Our team members visited industries like Bioklone and Briobliss to discuss about the Project, its overview and the various aspects involved in starting up a new company. We made a small presentation about our project to them. We put forth further concepts related to our project to them which made the discussion more understandable. We also learnt various methods to troubleshoot in case of any crises. We jotted down all the basic requirements to start a company by visiting their work space. They also provided guidance on how to tackle a problem when a product is released into the market. They encouraged us with a lot of valuable compliments. On the whole, the industries gave us very positive notion on all the required aspects.
