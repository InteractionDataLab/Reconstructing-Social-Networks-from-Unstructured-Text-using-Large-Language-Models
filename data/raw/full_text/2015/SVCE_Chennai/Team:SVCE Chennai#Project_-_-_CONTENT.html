strains of E. coli (P678-54, χ925) have been isolated that have been shown to harbor a mutation in 

a particular set of genes. FtsZ, one of the proteins involved in cell division has been shown to be 

one of those. Overexpression of this protein leads to septation at the poles, leading to the 

formation of the so-called minicells. The non-replicative behaviour of the minicells gives rise to 

a broad spectrum of applications. Our project focusses on engineering minicells to produce 

certain novel peptides called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins  are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 

produced by almost all bacteria having specific detrimental effect on the surrounding microbial 

community. Hence engineering minicells to produce bacteriocins can have a wide range of 

applications in fields like animal husbandry, human probiotics and strain selection.</P><P>Minicells will be engineered as probiotics to produce bacteriocins and can be used as a defence

against common infections and diseases in the gastro-intestinal tract. Because the minicells do 

not have the ability to multiply, there is no risk of infection associated with children and 

immune-compromised people. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been selected as a model gastro-

intestinal pathogen. The appropriate bacteriocin has been chosen to be Thuricin S, produced by 

Bacillus thuringiensis.</P><P>One of the most common issues in the field of Medicine and in general, Biology, the formation

of MRSA biofilms, can also be addressed with this approach. Studies have shown that a 

bacteriocin, Lysostaphin, can penetrate the biofilm and act on Staphylococcus aureus. But, the 

organism has already developed resistance towards lysostaphin. Building on that premise, we 

will be engineering minicells to produce Bactofencin A, a novel cationic bacteriocin produced by 

Staphylococcus simulans and test its functionality.</P><P>Aside from the above areas, there are other prospective areas where minicells producing 

bacteriocins can be applied. Bacteriocins are highly specific with respect to their target organism 

and will selectively kill the undesired organism to which it is directed against. This property can 

be utilized for strain selection on petri-plates. In addition, Clostridium botulinum – specific 

bacteriocin producing minicells can also be engineered to prevent botulism through packaged 

foods.</P><H3 id="intro" class="title">Plasmid Design</H3><P>Our project aims to neuter multidrug resistant bacterial infections with the help of bacteriocins in 

a minicell chassis.</P><P>Firstly, the idea was to use two different plasmids – one for minicell division and the other for

bacteriocin production. Then, we realized that plasmids are carried to the minicells. This requires 

the use of two different plasmids with two different promoters. Instead of going for two different 

plasmids, we modulated our design to a plasmid with two different expression cassettes.</P><P>The two cassettes are under the regulation of different promoters for the expression of the 

different phenotypes. Minicell phenotype, driven by the overexpression of the ftsZ gene, is under 

the regulation of the IPTG-controlled lac promoter. Bacteriocin production is driven by the 

             arabinose operon.</P><P>
         In order to confirm the expression of ftsZ, GFP is included under the lac promoter control by the 

introduction of an RBS after the ftsZ stop codon. Similarly, bacteriocin production is tagged to 

RFP.
         </P><P>pSB1K3 was preferred to pUC vectors since minicell purification involves the addition of 

penicillin and that requires penicillin – sensitivestrains. In order to drive very high expression of 

ftsZ, we decided to use the T7 promoter. It requires T7 RNA polymerase, which also needs to be 

cloned into the plasmid. ftsZ can be indirectly regulated by controlling the expression of T7 

             RNA polymerase.</P><P>A major drawback that can be seen in this design is that there are over 10 inserts and the total 

             insert size amounts to more than 8 kb.</P><P>The number of inserts and their size can be greatly reduced by judicious selection of the vector 

and the host strain. In order reduce the inserts corresponding to the ftsZ regulation which 

involves T7 RNA polymerase and promoter, BL21 was chosen as the host strain and pET 24a 

was identified as the vector. BL21 strain has T7 RNA polymerase inserted into its genomic 

DNA. pET 24a vector has a multiple cloning region preceded by an operator region consisting of 

             the lac operator and the T7 promoter.</P><P>Hence, a second construct was designed utilizing the pET 24a vector. The complete insert was to 

be inserted between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. After assembly of the parts by standard 

biobrick assembly, the complete insert will be PCR amplified with NdeI and XhoI sites flanking 

             the entire insert.</P><P>The sequences for both the cassettes were ordered as gBlocks® from IDT. The complete cassette 

was divided into two gBlocks® sized 1664 bp and 1057 bp respectively. A SacI site was 

introduced in the araC region of the pBAD promoter. The nucleotide in position 430 was 

mutated from C to G for creating a unique SacI site. The mutation created no changes in the 3’-

             5’ araC reading frame.</P><P>The gBlocks® received were PCR amplified. No amplification was detected for gBlock® 1. We 

deduced that the gBlock® had denatured into several small fragments by agarose gel 

electrophoresis. Hence, we set out for standard biobrick assembly to assemble ftsZ, T0 terminator 

and pBAD/araC promoter. The block 1 was constructed by assembling every component. PCR 

amplification was then done to introduce the NdeI and SacI restriction sites. The gblock® 2 

             containing the two test bacteriocin sequences were obtained from IDT.</P><P>The fragments were cloned one by one in the pET 24a vector.</P><H3 id="protocol" class="title">Protocols</H3><DIV id="accordion" class="panel-group"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapseThree">PLASMID ISOLATION
