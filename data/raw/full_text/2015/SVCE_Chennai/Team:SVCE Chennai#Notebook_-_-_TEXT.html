AUGUST 2015
Week 1
Submitted safety forms and also regarding our project forms.
Preparation of LB broth and LB Agar and plates were poured.
Stab culture for FtsZ was obtained from iGEM and was streaked on chloramphenicol LB plates.
Abstract and title of our project was uploaded.
Prepared chemicals and buffers for plasmid isolation.
FtsZ was innoculated in LB broth.
Pure culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and BL21 strain was obtained.
Sequences for gBlocks were constructed for ordering.
Week 2:
Plasmid isolation was performed for protocol optimisation.
Result was negative and so the isolation was performed again.
Elution of DNA was done but results were not satisfactory.
Media (SOB and SOC) were prepared for competent cell preparation.
Positive results were obtained for elution of DNA and protocol was optimised.
Innoculated BL 21 in SOB.
Presentation and questionnaire based on our project was prepared to educate the students in different colleges.
Logo designing was initiated.
Week 3:
Growth curve for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was done and results were analysed.
Growth curve for BL 21 was done.
Plasmid isolation of pET24a was performed.
Competent cell of BL 21 was made and protocol was optimised.
Seed stock for BL 21 competent cell was made.
Transformation was performed.
Primers required for our project were designed and ordered.
For Human Practise questionnaire for hospitals were prepared.
Presentation was done in Arulmigu Meenakshi Amman College and in Prathyusha Institute of Technology and Management.
Dr. Kannan from Saveetha Medical College was interviewed regarding antibiotic resistance.
Logo design was reviewed and changes were made.
Approached various funding agencies.
Collaboration with Uppsala was confirmed.
Week 4:
BL21 was subcultured.
Transformation efficiency of pET 24a in E coli BL21 competent cells was calculated.
Chloramphenicol plates were prepared for pSB1C3 amplification.
Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus were obtained.
Final safety forms were filled.
First step was taken for wiki page and its theme was discussed.
Responses for various questionnaire was collected and a statistical analysis was carried out.
Results were presented to the faculty members of our department.
Three doctors from reputed medical institutions were interviewed regarding the development of antibiotic resistance and formation of biofilms in hospital environments.
SEPTEMBER 2015
Week 1:
gBlocks of ftsZ was obtained.
PCR amplification of the ftsZ was done.
Results were found to be negative.
Hence they were troubleshooted.
Biochemical tests were performed for Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. A presentation was done during the national level symposium called OMICS and created an awareness among various other college students.
Week 2:
gBlocks of thuricin was obtained.
PCR amplification of the gene was done.
This amplified gene was cloned into pSB1C3.
Growth curve for Staphylococcus aureus was done.
Human practices team presented in Madha Engineering College and SBOA.
Week 3:
Got bactofencin gBlocks and PCR amplification was done.
Then cloning was done in pSB1C3.
Cloned Thuricin and Bactofencin were submitted as parts.
Public interview regarding antibiotic resistance was taken.
Descriptions were uploaded in wiki page.
Lets talk!
