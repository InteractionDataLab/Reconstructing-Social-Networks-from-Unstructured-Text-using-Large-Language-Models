Project Safety
Lab Safety
Introduction
Laboratories are often recognized with hazards of processing infectious agents. Safety measures were  carried out by the team by providing guidelines, engineering controls, management policies and work  practices. We followed a high standard of safe and responsible biological engineering. It is one of the primary  concerns of the team and we ensured that all the works carried are highly safe. In general, iGEM teams are trying              to pursue ambitious projects and reduce risks by using safer substitutes for more dangerous organisms/parts.
Project Safety
Our project which focuses on the production of minicins in which we mainly target gastro intestinal infections and  biofilm formation though are mostly caused by hazardous organisms such as Shigella, Clostridium etc., Our  team worked on class 2 organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus as model  organism to target the same with reduced risks and have a safe project design .

As our college is provided with well equipped class1 and class 2 cabinets ,which made it easier to handle these  organisms. Proper bio safety guidelines were also considered for cloning and synthetic biology works .
Lab Safety
We the team members have taken special online Good Microbiological Laboratory Practices before the project  was initiated. Though we reduced the risk hazards of the project by working on class 1 & class 2, safety is  essential all the time. The lab team concentrates more on the safety of handling organisms and parts used in the  project. All the safety cabinets and labs used for the project are well furnished with separate rooms for the  cabinets . Safety regarding chemicals used in the project is also considered, especially for Etbr, agarose and  other carcinogens which were always handled with gloves. The containment is also well autoclaved and discarded  by proper disposables to prevent risks to the environment . All the safety measures followed by the team were  guided by our instructors and we have also ensured that the final product of the work produces no risk or reduced               risk to the environment and other living organisms.
