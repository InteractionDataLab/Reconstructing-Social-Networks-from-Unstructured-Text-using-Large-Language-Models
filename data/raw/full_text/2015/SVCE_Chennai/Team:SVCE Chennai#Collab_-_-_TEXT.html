Collaboration
"Creating a better world requires team work, partnership and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the most few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another"
As the statement suggest, iGEM allows every team to join hands with other teams to benefit each other. Apparently our team had united with the following teams:
Aachen is a research university of technology located in Germany. Our team had collaborated with them through a formal meetup with one of their team members and also by filling their "TUBEFRONT" survey which is based on Safety Organisation.
Uppsala university is the research university in Uppsala, Sweden. We collaborated with this team by filling their Google forms, for their university.
Bettencourt team claimed us to fill their "FOOD SURVEY" form required for their survey which led to their collaboration with us.
