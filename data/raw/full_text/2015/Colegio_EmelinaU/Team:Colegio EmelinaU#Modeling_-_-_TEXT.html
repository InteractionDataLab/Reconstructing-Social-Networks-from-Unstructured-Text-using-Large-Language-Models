As we all know the UV rays are present all the year round, it is known that young people about 18 years old have received 80% of the radiation that would absorb during their whole life.
The main cause of the signs of aging is the UVA rays, some of those signs are wrinkles and loss of elasticity in the skin. These rays also have interference in non-melanoma cancers as CCE.
UV radiation causes skin damage, so we focus on creating an alert, that is not going to be used only on sunny days, but throughout the year, since, it is known that 40% of the radiation occurs when we are not at full sunlight.
In the picture, we see the linear graph model based on two plasmids , in which you can observe the promoter , terminator , RBS and the sequence of interest , which when we put them together, they form a more complex system. In the linear we can see how our BrioBricks relate to each other.
The constitutive promoter, expresses the sequence producing the protein dimer that joined to the tetR suppresses the second plasmid promoter and to the contact with the sun rays, generates a structure change, becoming in a monomer which allows that the RNA polymerase to connect to the promoter, our chromo protein be transcribed and our blue color is generated.
