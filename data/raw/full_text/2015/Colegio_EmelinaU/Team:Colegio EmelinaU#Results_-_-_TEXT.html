Result:
Perform laboratory experiments is not easy and this year and a half did many tests and trials, some were and some not. Here we show various electrophoresis techniques whereby biomolecules in solution are separated when they are subjected to an electric field. These allow us to realize when our protocols were well made or not. Ligation made on September 7 was the one we liked, made us feel that we were the best.
