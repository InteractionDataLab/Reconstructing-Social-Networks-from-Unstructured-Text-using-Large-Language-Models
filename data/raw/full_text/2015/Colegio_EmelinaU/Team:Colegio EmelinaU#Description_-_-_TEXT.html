"UV WRISTBAND PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE"
While scientists strive to find a cure for skin cancer we seek to prevent it. We focus on creating a signal to alert citizens and they can protect themselves from danger of these rays. All this under the approach of synthetic biology, not using plastic silicone or other contaminants. In Chile in the last 5 years there have been 20-25 cases of skin cancer per 100 inhabitants. One of the main factors is Ultraviolet (UV) radiation which causes severe cell damage when a certain amount is exceeded. Our team proposes a system that alerts the intensity of UV radiation. The project is represented by a wristband that is composed by genetically modified bacteria that detects ultraviolet light and according to intensity/danger, a coloration is generated. This will enable people to protect themselves from UV rays when its intensity is detrimental to cells.
Background
UV radiation is a natural radiation which we are in contact every day. At low doses it is harmless to the cells and can even be beneficial for the survival of an organism. However when a certain amount is exceeded , it can cause a serious cell damage. UV daily with greater impact on the ground, product to reducing the ozone layer which affects skin cells. Skin cancer is one of the most severe that are produced by UV radiation. Today skin tumors are the most common type of human neoplasms . If the humans skin subjected to chronic exposure to UV radiation , they incite various biological responses , such as: the development of erythema, edema , burns cells , hyperplasia , immune suppression , DNA damage , photo-aging , which can lead to cancer . There are different types of UV rays :
UVA radiation is considered as "radiation aging " and it is able to penetrate deeply into the epidermis and dermis of the skin. UVA injury tends to cause necrosis of endothelial cells , damaging dermal vessels . Since this type of radiation can cause structural damage to DNA and damage the immune system, it can lead to cancer formation . It has been associated with 67% of malignant melanomas . VB radiation is considered "radiation burns " . It is able to penetrate the epidermis acting mainly at the level of the basal layer of cells, damaging the genome of the keratinocytes , vital stem cells of the epidermis . Both direct and indirect adverse biological effects such as: photoproducts formation , stimulation of DNA synthesis , cell cycle arrest , photo carcinogenesis premature and photo aging . Genetic damage induced by UV radiation Damage DNA caused by UV radiation can be produced by different mechanisms , one of them is by direct absorption of the photon energy, that is, they cause the formation of dimers of adjacent pyrimidines , this distorts locally DNA structure interfering normal complementary base pairing and producing a slight rise in the affected string. Most of the dimers are repaired immediately, but some avoid from the reparation and can affect the processes of replication and transcription , this means that affects the cell cycle and hence cancer has begun .
