Protocols And Biosafety
To perform our construct the following procedures
were followed
1. Resuspension de biobricks
2. Genetic Transformation
3. Plasmid Extraction
4. Digestion
5. Band Purification
6. Ligation
Removing long plasmidial
1. Inoculate desired strains into 2 ml of Plasmid broth (see Appendix B) plus antibiotic.
2. Aerate at 30-37°C until the cultures are fully saturated ( 8 hours to overnight).
3. Pour approximately 1.4 ml of culture into a microcentrifuge tube.
4. Sediment the cells in a microcentrifuge for 30 seconds.
5. Remove the spent culture medium with a water aspirator equipped with a micropipette   tip or with a pasteur pipette. Remove as much liquid as possible.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 0.1 ml of PEB (see p.502) with gentle vortexing. Make sure that   the pellet is well-dispersed. Clumped cells yield decreased DNA.
7. Add 0.2 ml of ALM (see p.501) and mix gently by inverting the tube. The solution will clear
8. Add 0.15 ml of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.8; see p.502). Mix well by inverting and shaking   the tube. A flocculent white precipitate will form.
9. Sediment the precipitate at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet contains chromosomal   DNA and cell debris; the plasmid is in the supernatant.
10. Recover 400ul of supernatant into a clean tube containing 0.8 ml of cold 95% ethanol. The   insoluble “pellet” tends to float; avoid taking big chunks.
11. Chill for 30 minutes to overnight at -20°C. A light-brown DNA precipitate will form. This is a  good stopping point; the ethanol precipitate can be left indefinitely at -20°C.
12. Sediment the precipitate in a microcentrifuge at 14.000 rpm for 5 minutes.
13. Discard the supernatant and rinse the pellet with 1ml of cold 95% ethanol.
14. Sediment the pellet in a microcentrifuge at 14.000 rpm for 2 minutes and remove the   residual ethanol with a micropipette.
15. Dry the pellet in a rotary evaporator for 5 minutes or in air for 30-60 minutes.
16. Dissolve the pellet in 0.05ml of TE (see p.502) and store at 4°C. Allow 60 minutes or more   for the DNA to go completely into solution.
17. Add 0.05ml of 5 M LiCl (see p.502) and mix well.
18. Incubate on ice for 5-10 minutes.
19. Sediment the precipitate in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet  contains RNA and residual cell debris; the plasmid is in the supernatant.
20. Recover 100ul of supernatant into a clean tube containing 0.2ml of cold 95% ethanol.
21. Chill for 60 minutes to evernight at -20°C. A brown DNA precipitate will form. This is a
good stopping point; the ethanol precipitate can be left indefinitely at -20°C.
22. Sediment the precipitate in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
23. Discard the supernatant and rinse the pellet with 1ml of cold 95% ethanol
24. Sediment the pellet in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes and remove the   residual ethanol with a micro-pipette.
25. Dry the pellet in a rotary evaporator for 5 minutes or in air for 30-60 minutes.
26. Dissolve the pellet in 0.05ml of TE. The plasmid DNA is now ready for restriction analysis;  5ul per digest is usually sufficient. The DNA is fairly stable at 4°C, but it can be frozen at -  20°C for long-term storage.
Short Plasmid Extraction
1. Pelleting 1ml of culture for 5 minutes
2. Remove excess. Re-suspend pellet in 250uL suspension (Cell Resuspension Solution)

8. Discard the clear lysate ( 700ul ) of the spin column
9. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard it below.
10. Stick on 750ul of Wash Solution (ethanol). Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard supernatant.
11.Stick on 250uL of Wash Solution . Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. discard supernatant
12.Transfer to a tube
13.Add 80ul of H2OMQ . Centrifuge for 1 minute.

Biosafety
The parameters used in the laboratories are supervised by CONICYT(National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research) for the Chilean laboratories , we work in biosafety level 1 and use the parameters of physical and biological containment . All waste (bacterium ) are disinfected in an autoclave , we use gloves to handle organic matter and apron to protect our physical integrity.
