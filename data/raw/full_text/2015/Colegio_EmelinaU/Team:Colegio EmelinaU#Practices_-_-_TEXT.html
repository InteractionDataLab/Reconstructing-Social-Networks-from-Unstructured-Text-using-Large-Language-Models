In order to make our project public, we have participated in different activities such as the Fiesta de la Ciencia in Quinta Normal, Santiago de Chile, in the Campamento Chile Va 2014, in Picarquín, Chile, in the home-made extraction of DNA in scientific fairs. Besides, means of communication of our country have been interested in our project and they have shown the project in different ways, we have appeared in television, radio and local newspapers, among others. We enjoy spreading science although we don´t like photographs … We invite you to know our great experience and support science.
