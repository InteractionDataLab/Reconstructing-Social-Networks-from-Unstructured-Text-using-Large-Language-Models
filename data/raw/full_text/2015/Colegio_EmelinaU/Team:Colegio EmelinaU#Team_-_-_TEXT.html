Sade Valdes For me, IGEM has been the first project which I have participated. It has made me grow as a person and realize that science is the issue that I’m most interested in and the path that I want to follow. I like to dance break-dance, skateboarding, and play basketball in my spare time, despite not having much. I like reading books and watching science fiction and horror movies.
Jacqueline Puebla
Hi, I'm the teacher of these science geniuses, I'm proud of them for having reached this stage and attend to the Jamboree in Boston. I tell you that over a year ago I'm the responsible to encourage and motivate my students to carry out their project. By profession, I am a biology and chemistry teacher, but only since the last year I internalized in genetically modified biological machines, for me it was amazing to see the significance that has synthetic biology and I want to continue specializing in it.
