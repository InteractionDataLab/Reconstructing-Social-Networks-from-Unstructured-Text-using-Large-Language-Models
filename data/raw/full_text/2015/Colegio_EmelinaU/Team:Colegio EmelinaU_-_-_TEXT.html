Description:
According to the Ministry of Health in Chile in the last 5 years there have been 20-25 cases of skin cancer per 100 inhabitants. One of the main factors causing skin cancer is the ultraviolet radiation (UV). This is a natural radiation which in low dose is harmless to the cells, even it can be beneficial for an organism survival. However, when a certain amount is exceeded, it can cause a serious cell damage. The highest levels of UV radiation are reported in Chile. Our team proposes a system that alerts the intensity of UV radiation. In detail, the project it is represented in a bracelet which it is composed by Bacillus subtilis bacteria that is modified genetically with a system that senses ultraviolet light and according to the intensity it generate the correct coloration . This will allow people to protect themselves from UV rays when its intensity is harmful for the cells.
