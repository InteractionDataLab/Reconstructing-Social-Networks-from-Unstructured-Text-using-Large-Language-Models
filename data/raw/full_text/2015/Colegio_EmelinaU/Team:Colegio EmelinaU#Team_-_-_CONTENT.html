In my free time I like reading, research and learn new things, I listen to rock music, and watch &quot;Big Bang Theory &quot;
I consider myself as a trustworthy person , with personality and sometimes sociable. I am passionate about literature, theater , music and especially the science related to chemistry and biology.
After high school, I want to study something related to biotechnology career, because in the short time I've been immersed in this world it has fascinated me all this area of science .

I'm a 11th (eleventh) grade student at Emelina Urrutia School. I consider myself as a creative and optimistic person, I love the design, innovation and science.
My experience in IGEM has been very enjoyable and satisfying , I have gained a lot of knowledge about synthetic biology and how it can be used in daily life; That's why I think IGEM is a great opportunity to develop myself as a person and a future scientific .</P><H2>Sade Valdes</H2><P>Sade Valdes
For me, IGEM has been the first project which I have participated. It has made me grow as a person and realize that science is the issue that I’m most interested in and the path that I want to follow.
I like to dance break-dance, skateboarding, and play basketball in my spare time, despite not having much. I like reading books and watching science fiction and horror movies.</P><H2>Jacqueline Puebla</H2><P>Hi, I'm the teacher of these science geniuses, I'm proud of them for having reached this stage and attend to the Jamboree in Boston. I tell you that over a year ago I'm the responsible to encourage and motivate my students to carry out their project.
By profession, I am a biology and chemistry teacher, but only since the last year I internalized in genetically modified biological machines, for me it was amazing to see the significance that has synthetic biology and I want to continue specializing in it.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
