Design:
The design is the most important part of the project many times but some parts are used to  advance the project are to be modified.  Plasmid structure model is based on two plasmids. In plasmid Number 1 you can find parts about:   constitutive promoter , RBS, tetR - DBD - UVR8 and terminator ; and in plasmid Number 2 there   are parts about : the promoter , RBS, amilCP- blue chromoprotein and terminator. This design is   clear in the modeling, as this explains how each part interacts.
