Genetic transformation of red coloration [B0010]
Plasmid removing: [K909008]= tetR-DBD-UVR8
[B0010]= Terminator [R0040]= Promoter
June 13th, 2015
Genetic transformation of [ B0010 ] * failed . We make a new attempt
Electrophoresis : [ K909008 ]
[ B0010 ] [ R0040 ]

Expanded coloring [ B0010 ]
Make plasmid removing [ B0010 ]
Perform digests [ B0010 ] = ( Terminator ) Digestion
[ K909008 ] = ( tetR - DBD - UVR8 ) Double digestion
