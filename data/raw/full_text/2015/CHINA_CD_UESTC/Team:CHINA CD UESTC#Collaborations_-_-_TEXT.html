COLLABORATIONS
  This year the collaboration of our team with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team were very smoothly as expected. We helped each other from the aspects of experimental design, experiment results verification and software to reach the iGEM spirit of resource sharing. The following is a detailed description.
In 2015 iGEM, we CHINA_CD_UESTC team collaborated with SCU_China team and UESTC-software team. We communicated several times, helped each other and shared our resources, which generated a great atmosphere of cooperation and mutual assistance. Indeed, we helped SCU_China team finish the prediction and experiment design about RBS in their project.
In this process, our team had completed two aspects of the collaboration work:
(1) Help SCU_China team to design the experiments and complete the experimental demonstration of RBS forecast outcomes.
(2) Provide the theoretical support of developing SD Finder software aiming to predict the ribosome binding site (RBS) position to UESTC-software team.
Design experiments for SCU_China team
We helped SCU_China team design the experiment. In order to find the unknown RBS position and standard it, we designed the folowing experiments for them:
1. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
2. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifD
3. Demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
4. Mutant demonstration of RBS located in upstream of the gene nifK
CHINA_CD_UESTC team finally completed the design of these experiments, which helped SCU_China team accomplish the work of forecast RBS position.
SD Finder Theoretical Support
It was in our theoretical knowledge support that UESTC-software team helped SCU_China team develop a RBS prediction software which named SD Finder. The two teams, CHINA_CD_UESTC team and UESTC-software team, made up deficiencies in theoretical support and software technology to each other and cooperated to complete the SD Finder smoothly. The main function of SD Finder is helping user predict the ORF and SD sequence of DNA sequence. Software links below:
