SAFETY
  We try our best to list the security considerations of our project design here. But it is clear that we still cannot guarantee that we have put all of the safety factors into consideration. So, if we cannot give you a satisfaction answer on this page, please contact us, and we will give you an explanation of our project that is safe.
Biosafety is about the intrinsic hazards of living organisms and how to handle them safely. Genetic material as such (‘naked’ DNA) can be dangerous as well. Before starting to work with pathogens or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a laboratory, one should stop and think about the possible hazards of these organisms, and take proportionate measures to minimise any risks for human health and the environment. ....Safety first...! (Biosafety in the laboratory 3rd, revised edition)
Prevention and control measures we have taken are mainly concentrated in the following aspects:
Researcher
Our researchers are all professional trained and watched the video about safe project design. When doing experiments, everyone is demanded to wear lab coat and gloves to avoid contacting with poisonous chemicals and bacteria, besides, researchers must be according to the Standard operating procedure.
Bacteria
The E.coli we used in our project are DH5α、JM109、BL21(DE3) and MC1061，which are all modified strains and non-pathogen. The Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 is also belong to the risk group 1 organisms.
Material
The vectors that used in our project are commercial. Our parts, both basic parts and devices, are all taken from risk group 1 organisms and therefore do not contain nor mimic any virulence factors. This would be indicative that our system is a very low hazardousness.
Bio-waste
Any waste containing bacteria are requested to autoclaved before be carried out laboratory. Make the dissemination of organisms or genetic material to the environment undesired minimized.
Questions and answers
1. Is there exist any of chemistry in your project raise safety issues to researchers?
Answer: There are no hazardous chemicals that we used in the laboratory except for Ethidium Bromide that we used in a special place for gel visualization and some buffers used in commercially available kits. In addition, our researchers are all trained and they have a good knowledge of protecting themselves and making the public safety.
2. If your genetically modified organisms (GMOs) disseminate to the environment undesired what are the risks resulting?
Answer: The bacterium we use are all modified, they are not able to grow outside the lab environment. Even cleaner can kill them easily.
3. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Answer: Our parts are all taken from risk group 1 organisms. We have followed all the safety procedures during the isolation process from the cells and we successfully isolated the DNA without any problems that will raise safety issues.
4. Do you think your project exist any other potential risk?
Answer: I can not say that our project is absolutely safe, as for the potential risk, it is of great concern to avoid the spread of antibiotic resistance. All our constructs are based on non - antibiotic - resistance bacteria, which couldn't transfer resistance genes to other bacteria, in case of leakage.
All in all, even though there could potentially be some risks related to our project, it is safe enough to continue our project. As members of the synthetic biology community, we promise that we are responsible for the safety of the biological device and equipment which we designed, built and shared.
