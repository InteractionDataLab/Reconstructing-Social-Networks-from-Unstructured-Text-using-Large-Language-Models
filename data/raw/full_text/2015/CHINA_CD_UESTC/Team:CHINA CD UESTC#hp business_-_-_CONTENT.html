                                This year the UESTC iGEM team undertook our project with human practices in mind. While we have established a detailed safety system in our experiments, we wanted to ensure that our system was sufficiently complete and qualified. Besides, sufficient theoretical preparation is helpful for us to talk with enterprises. Therefore, we wanted to ensure that academic and government professionals’ concerns were taken into consideration during the design process of our system. In order to best accomplish this, we conducted interviews with the professor of the Hong Kong University Medicine School. His experience allowed us to better ensure our experiment safety system.
                            </P><P>
                                Members of the Hong Kong University Medicine School visited UESTC Life Science and Technology School. We iGEM experiment team took the opportunity to talk about our project with Professor Zhaoyi Hu. Knowing the main processes of our project, Prof.Hu said, &quot;It seems that the competition not only requires you players have a certain professional basis and innovation capability, but also is a test of students' learning and thinking comprehensive ability.&quot; Then he put forward his concerns especially in biosafety aspects, namely, whether the bacteria source itself is safe or pathogenic, and if gene modified organisms are safe.
                            </P><P>
                                In the aspect of biosafety, our project have achieved three aspects as following:
                                <STRONG>
                                    1. The safety of bacteria source: </STRONG><I>DH5α</I>
                                    and <I>BL21</I>
                                    (
                                    <I>DE3</I>
                                    ) we used are common bacterial strains;
                                    <STRONG> 2. The safety of transgenosis: </STRONG> The genes we will transfer are nonpathogenic and nonpolluting. There are little adverse impacts on environment and rare probability of transgene escape.
                                    <STRONG> 3. The safety of experimental operation:</STRONG>  We players have formed a strict operation habit, such as sterilization of transgenosis bacterias, protection of experimenters.
                            </P><P>
                                In the end, Prof.Hu told us the general processes of sample treatment in medical research as well as separation and preservation methods of some bacteria strains.
                            </P><P>
                                Prof. Zhaoyi Hu is head of Microbiology Department of Hong Kong University Medicine School, Infection and Immunity Joint Research Center of Hong Kong University. Their results research have a broad impact on international academic circles, especially the medical community .

							</H4><P>
								One of the novelties of our human practices this year is the contact between enterprises and us. This is the first time for us that we try to have positive action to communicate with social enterprises, raising awareness in the society about iGEM and synthetic biology. We approached two biotechnology companies in order to achieve the following points:
								<STRONG>1:</STRONG>
								Communicate with different kinds of social people and get some advice from them.
								<STRONG>2:</STRONG>
								Spread iGEM to more individuals and groups who want to have a good understanding of synthetic biology.
								<STRONG>3:</STRONG>
								As we want to apply our Magnetotatic <I>E.coli</I>
								into the biofuel cell, we would like to learn more about the market situation.
								<STRONG>4:</STRONG>
								Initial contact to the Chengdu Biology Maker,seek future cooperation.

								Aug 12th 2015, our team leaved for office of Anno Medical Devices Co.Ltd in Longhu times street, Pi County, in order to converse with Mr.Xu，Professor Lei and Engineer Xiang of the Chengdu Biology Maker.
							</P><P>
								From the biological perspectives, “If what you want to get is the production of Magnetotatic <I>E.coli</I>
								, magnetic nanoparticle, the key point is about controllability and verifiability of experimental results. If you expect potential products，raw materials and intermediate operation of each step are best to comply with biosafety. In terms of the competition, there might be short in technical conditions, however it’s a good way to think more about ideas,” Prof. Lei put forward some personal opinions in regard to our project.
							</P><P>
								“I do look forward to seeing your Magnetotatic
								<I>E.coli</I>
								are able to apply to the disease detection and treatment. At the same time, I am willing to offer support on instruments and reagents, and help you to connect with other related enterprises for more communication about iGEM and your project,” manager of Anno Medical Devices Co.Ltd, Mr.Xu said.
							</P><P>
								Engineer Xiang said that he hope to strengthen the communication and cooperation between the college students and the Chengdu Biology Maker. Not only the guidance of Project design, but also experimental operation, our open source laboratory can satisfy the requirement. It is a good way to develop extensive cooperation by attending iGEM competition as Biological enthusiasts.
							</P><H4 id="hp02"><STRONG>2.Jin Douyun Space Company</STRONG></H4><P>
								Aug 13th 2015, we arrived at the Jin Douyun Space Company with Manager Zhiyong Xu, and communicated with Manager Jianjun Deng and Sichuan Strategic Alliance of Medical Devices Innovation director Dan Li.
							</P><P>
								After Kaiyue Zhang briefly introduced iGEM competition and our project, Manger Deng indicated that the prospect of iGEM as top competition of Synthetic Biology would be inestimable, and strongly supported college students to attend this competition to make a little contribution to the national biology. He expected the results of our project and encouraged us to promote the project’s development in the level of product to dig more application value about Magnetotactic
								<I>Escherichia coli</I>
								.
							</P><P>
								At the end of the communication, Director Li showed that he would bring the propaganda of iGEM to the Sichuan Strategic Alliance of Medical Devices Innovation and supported the development of Synthetic Biology in China.
							</P><P>
								Through the communications with biotechnology companies, we had completed the goal that to promote iGEM out of campus. But we will never stop and make people in mounting numbers to realize and recognize synthetic biology, then we can use this to improve our life.
							</P><H2 id="hp03"><STRONG>Our Team and Maker Work Hand in Hand</STRONG></H2><DIV id="content"><DIV class="grid_8"><H4> Purpose:
							</H4><P>
								After communicating with biotechnology companies, we contacted with <STRONG>Chengdu Biology Maker</STRONG> to have further cooperation with social organization. On one hand, we would like to spread the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology. On the other hand, we could ask for their help about the technical support.
								</P><P>
								Aug 25th 2015, after receiving the invitation of the engineer Jianping Xiang from Chengdu Biology Maker, our team went to his studio to visit. The day we coincided with Shanghai Fab Lab director, Prof. Junfeng Ding, who also came to the studio for exchange. Accordingly, we had a conversation with him. He gave us some advice about marketing and promotion of project. Hereafter, we visited the Biology Maker Studio. After getting aware of their autonomous projects, we were exceedingly interested in their 3D printer which made by themselves because of the idea that we originally hoped to find something to help make our enzymatic biofuel cell device. Listened to our request, Mr. Xiang was glad to help us. The specific 3D printing device is shown in the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:CHINA_CD_UESTC/Results#3Ddevice">Results.</A></P><P>
										Meanwhile, people from Chengdu Biology Maker had a general knowledge to iGEM from us and said they hope to participant in this competition as graduates in order to communicate with varieties of worldwide superior teams about synthetic biology.
										</P><P>
										Soon afterwards, we went to the Biology Maker Space located in SWJTU Science and Technology Park to attend Prof. Ding’s sharing session. It was the first time that we got aware of Fabrication Laboratory. Interestingly, the Fab Lab is started by MIT CBA. This year the biology area is shown in Fab Lab for the first time. During this session we found that the technology innovating is not only for scientists but also for the users in our daily life. Everyone is the subject of technological innovation.
