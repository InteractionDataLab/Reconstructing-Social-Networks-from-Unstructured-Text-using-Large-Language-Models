INSTRUCTORS
  This year the team's four coaches gave us a wide range of guidance and advice in the past five months which has become one of the indispensable reasons that we successful completed our project. All members of our team are very thankful for their help.
Lixia Tang
Professor Tang is a wise lady with a lofty virtue and a glorious name. Her main guiding was the test stage results deliberations, which helped us to verify the efficient of our lac-fuel cell. With her advice about experimental skills, we put the knowledge into practice in our project easier.
Yong Zhang
Professor Zhang mainly tutored us about experimental instructions.  He looks very serious but actually very tender. His experience gave us a lot of help to complete our project especially the grasp of details and requirements.
Xuelian Zheng
Professor Zheng is really a model of us for her rigorous spirit in experiments. She always participated in  our project scheme discussions as well as results deliberations. She is also an amiable mother who loves to share interesting stories about her son.
Kejun Deng
She is an intelligent woman with a pair of beautiful eyes. Mrs. Deng always helped us replenish laboratory supplies as much as possible, which made us concentrate on our work. She likes to encourage us with her heart-warming smile.
