ATTRIBUTIONS
  This is the list of contributions and the use of resources of our all team members throughout the whole iGEM competition. Our team is composed of 11 undergraduates and 4 instructors. What we represent about our entire final results all come from our 11 students. Hope this page can provide you with a clear message.
This year our team was responsible for almost all aspects of running the team. There are the details of each member who has contributed to the particular work.
EXPERIMENT
Kaiyue Zhang, Tao Li, Xingyang Qiu, Guang Zhang and Zhi Zeng collaborate on the project-specific design, including improve the theory, process design, develop protocols, experimental operation. Details as follows:
Kaiyue Zhang integrated the whole team and the coordination of each experimental parts, who is also in charge of modeling.
Tao Li was responsible for the project design and the piGEM-AB vector’s construction. In order to verify the promoter, he designed the experimental program and did the experiment with Guang Zhang and Zhi Zeng. He also established the enzymatic biofuel cell and made it generate electricity.
Xingyang Qiu was in charge of the experimental design and construction of the vector which carries gene clusters of mamW + RFP + laccase.
Guang Zhang and Zhi Zeng were responsible for the design and built up the gene clusters mamGFDC + mamXYZ + mms6.
HUMAN PRACTICE
Xu Zhao took charge of the planning and execution of Education section, and designed the establishment items of iGEM Southwest Union, and connected the biotechnology companies and Chengdu Biology Maker for the Business part activities.
Kun Yan took charge of the planning and execution of aid education in Education part, chaired the iGEM Southwest Union meeting, and he was responsible for the establishment of UESTC iGEM club.
WIKI
Manni Zhang was in charge of the entire design and construction work of wiki page and the arrangement of text.
Xue Liu and Haonan Tian translated and proofread all the text.
They took charge of the text work and translation work. They also proofread sectional texts and conducted some transformation experiments and ligation experiments.
ARTWORK
