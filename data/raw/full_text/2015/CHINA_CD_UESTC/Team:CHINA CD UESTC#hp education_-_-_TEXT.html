PUBLICITY
  We carried out a series of activities to educate different grades and area of students: gave a novel biological science lesson to kids in the kindergarten; demonstrated an interesting synthetic biology project to students in the primary school; spread iGEM to the remote mountainous area schools.
iGEM and Biology Promogation
Purpose:
For the consideration of publicize iGEM and synthetic biology from education aspect, we developed a dual-focus, comprehensive educational program targeting students. We thought that educating students is the most effective way to let individuals quickly know what the synthetic biology is. The team planned and carried out a series of iGEM educational lectures for aged 5-13 years old as part of the University of Electronic Science and Technology’s Education programs event.
1) We went to kindergarten to teach the children some biological knowledge by way of science course.
2) We held an interesting biology lecture on the Experimental Primary School Affiliated to UESTC.
3) We extended iGEM to the village schools in order to spread iGEM to remote areas which is low-education. We wanted to teach them more things they do not understand. Viewed from another aspect, we would like to propagation iGEM to wherever our capacity allows.
1. Let us make biology more popular
On June 18th 2015, following our experiment team instructor Xuelian Zheng, we team members went to the Experimental Kindergarden Affiliated to UESTC, giving a fascinating and novel biological science lesson to kids. To attract kids’ interests, We presented our project the training road of Escherichia coli by pictures and cards. The story is mainly around an ordinary Escherichia coli . The protagonist went through four major difficulties, finally it developed a magnet absorbing ability like “Magneto” and realized its dream of getting super power.

Besides, we also prepared a simple scientific experiment, swimming grapes. Changing water density by adding sugar, salt and other solutes, grapes under the water can float to the surface of it. The purpose of the experiment is to let kids realize that science is hiding in everyday life and hands-on operation in scientific inquiry is full of charm. At last, we gave every kid some okra seeds as gifts. By planting these seeds in their spare time, they can experience the process of life growth personally. We promised that we would harvest the okra fruits together in autumn.
2. Pupils think different
On June 19th 2015, following our experiment team head instructor Lixia Tang, we team members went to the Experimental Primary School Affiliated to UESTC to demonstrate an interesting synthetic biology project to students. Because students had learned the growth process of  silkworms before, Mrs. Tang introduced some fundamental synthetic biology research results like colorized silkworms, colorized roses and so on.
Furthermore, students also learned biological terms like DNA, RNA.  Subsequently, Kun Yan  took a hero of  “ The Avengers”  as an example to explain the main processes of synthetic biology experiments. By telling these, he led to iGEM,  introducing many interesting iGEM projects of previous years. In the meantime, the students were keeping high enthusiasm, answered a lot of questions correctly. Finally, we organized each student to draw a picture about what synthetic biology project they want to do in the future and to share with others. After the activity, we gave every kids a nite writer pen as gifts. We deeply felt kids’ vigorous vitality and unlimited dream. Meanwhile we also planted a little iGEM seed in kids’ hearts, hoping it would sprout, bloom and fruit.
Let's see a collection of paintings.
We organized each student to draw a picture about what synthetic biology project they want to do in the future and to share with others.
I wanted to transform fishes in the ocean into magical fishes, the fishes are able to absorb and deal with marine litter in order to purify the sea.
I want to design a plant sprayer. As long as the sprayer sprays on the budding plant seedlings, seedlings will grow rapidly. It does not spoil things by excessive enthusiasm, but really help the plants grow faster.
At first, I want to create a kind of drink, it can put people into superhuman; then, I want to produce a magical machine, by using this machine, people can become very strong, like Captain America.
I want to change the monotonous color of ducks, I want them to become colorful, and they can also lay colorful eggs.
I want to let the eggs hatched dinosaurs, then extract the dinosaur genes in order to inject to human, finally the engineered human can also become a dinosaur.
I want to make a submarine pump, it can absorb the garbage and the bodies of marine organisms, and transform them into food supply for the other sea creatures.
All of the paintings are put up on the wall of our lab.
3. Poverty can't beat the knowledge
In terms of iGEM education and publicity, we want to spread iGEM further. During the summer vacation, we established four teaching teams and send them to the remote mountainous area to publicize iGEM. Here will show you two teams of them. The members of the teams are all come from our iGEM club . They brought the children seven-day biology and science classes. Not only brought them knowledge but also introduced iGEM.
Our ‘Fluorescent’ teaching teamd went to Qiaolong country primary school which is located in Qiaolong Country, Zhouli Town, Baohua Township, Anyue County, Ziyang City, Sichuan Province. Although the facilities in that school is not good, the students are all hard working. Zhang Zelong which in the figure is our chemistry teacher, and he is teaching the children chemistry. Starting from basic chemistry knowledge, Mr. Zhang then talked about iGEM.
Mr. Zhang introduced some basic information about iGEM including the origin and all kinds of subject area especially the synthetic biology. Then he gave the students a brief introduction about some interesting iGEM subjects and showed the relation between those subjects and our life. In the end, Mr. Zhang told the children to pay more attention to their daily life to see if they can use some synthetic biology way to solve problems. He encouraged students to work hard and make those methods come true.
The ‘Eyas’ teaching team’s destination is Chenjiatan primary school, Lushaer Town, Xining City, Qinghai Province. During that time, our members explained iGEM and some synthetic biology knowledge by using projector. After children got aware of basic conception about synthetic biology, they used their pen to draw their life with biology technology. Their enthusiasm and interest showed us the future of synthetic biology.
