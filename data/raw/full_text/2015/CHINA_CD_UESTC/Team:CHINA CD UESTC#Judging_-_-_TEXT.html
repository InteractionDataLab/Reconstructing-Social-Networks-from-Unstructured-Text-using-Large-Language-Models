JUDGING
  We meet all the requirements of 13 medals’ standards, and this year we expect to get two iGEM awards, best integrated human practice and best wiki. In this section, we clearly show each entries up to the standards. Please judge.
6/6 Bronze Requirements
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Our team has been registered. And after a wonderful summer, the members will have fun at the Giant Jamboree!
Complete and submit the Judging form.
We have accomplished and submitted the Judging form on time.
Make a wiki
We sure did, you are currently on it.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Our six team members are going to attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston, where we will present a Poster and Talk about our project in Room 306 on September 27 at 4:00 PM. If you are interested, please come to our booth.
Clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others.
We describe how we divided the main responsibilities between us, team members on the section Attributions , which also describes all the help we have received.
Document one new standard BioBrick and submit it to the iGEM Registry.
17 new BioBricks can be found in the section Parts which have been submitted.
3/3 Silver Requirements
Experimentally validate a BioBrick of your own design and construction works as expected.
We have experimentally validated the BioBricks of BBa_K1779204 and BBa_K1779200 work as expected.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We have successfully submitted these Parts .
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench.
Our Human Practices have involved these important questions beyond the bench, including Publicity, NGO of iGEM and Industry. Please read the Overview for more details.
4/4 Gold Requirements
Expand on your silver medal Human Practices activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Our Human Practices have expanded on the silver medal by demonstrating the investigated issues into the design and execution of our project, especially Industry and Safety advice .
Help any registered iGEM team.
We helped two registered iGEM teams: UESTC_Software team and SCU_China team. Please read the details on the Collaborations .
Improve the function or characterization of a previously existing BioBrick Part.
We have improved the function of a previously existing BioBrick Part: BBa_K863005 in two ways. Please click: BBa_K1779204 and BBa_K1779200 for more details.
Demonstrate a functional prototype of your project.
Different from the projects of pervious teams, we designed and constructed the enzymatic bio-fuel cell by ourselves which could work efficiently. Please read the details on the Design .
iGEM Prizes
Integrated Human Practices
Safety advice from Prof. Hu who is studying in the Hong Kong University Medicine School, his experience helped us better ensure our project's safety system.
Technicians in biotechnology companies put forward some opinions to the potential products of our project, which helped us to consider the application of the project.
Chengdu Biology Maker helped us make a bio-fuel cell device , used by their 3D printer which made by themselves.
