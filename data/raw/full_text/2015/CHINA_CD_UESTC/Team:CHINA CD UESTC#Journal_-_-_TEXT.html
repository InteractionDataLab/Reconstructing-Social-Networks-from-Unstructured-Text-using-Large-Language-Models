  Hi! Here recorded the “significant” stages of our team which we experienced throughout the whole summer. In the initial establishment of our team, we organized various social activities and uneasy demonstrated the project at the first time, which all presents to you here.
Journal
March 24th
The establishment of our team!
March 26th
Came up with gas detector that examine institution and several diseases of our body.
March 28th
Put forward a kind of novel plant paint which can paint on the plant surface to absorb PM2.5.
April 1st
Catch the idea of yeast probiotic yogurt which helps people who allergic to alcohol to rapid degradation of ethanol.
April 6th
We had a brain storming: tracer showing the concentration of biomolecules, plants can emit colored light, new type of bacterial cell, and wastewater treatment by magnetotactic bacterium, etc.
April 9th
We established the iGEM club in our campus.
April 20th
Determined the project as "magnetotactic E.coli generates electronics."
April 22th
Ascertained the origin of mamW gene in MSR-1 genome.
April 27th
Ascertained the origin of laccase gene - derived from Escherichia coli.
May 5th
Designed the primers of mamW, RFP and laccase.
May 7th
Purchased the laboratory consumables and prepared for the first human practice activity.
May 8th
Communicated with professor Hu from Hong Kong University Medicine School.
May 10th
Determined three vectors for co-transferred which are pACYCDuet-1, pET28a and pCDFDuet-1.
June 12th

August 25th
We visited Chengdu Biology Maker Space and got their technical support.
August 29th
We were excited to obtain the exact Parts including the mamW gene and mutanted it.
August 30th
We completed our enzymatic biofuel cell! It worked as we expected!
September 2nd
The first time we presented our whole project presentation in front of all instructors and professors of our school.
September 10th
It is an exciting day that we sent our Parts to MIT, wish the little box bon voyage. Happy to complete the construction of cell device and start to test it.
