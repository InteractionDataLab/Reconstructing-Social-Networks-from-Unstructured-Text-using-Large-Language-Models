Project Overview
After putting forward the conception of Euk.cement , we made much effort on verifying the feasibility of this idea. To echo the background of different social problems, our project emerges from vital requirement, and we did find a novel way to try to solve these problems.
Are you intrested in the mimetic seabed testing system we constructed? Do you anticipate our engineering yeast to live and function well in sands?
In our project, we designed different protocol and application designs to expect better application of our Euk.cement. We believe this original project will finally solve the problems mentioned in the background. Please look forward our Euk.cement.
