Parts Overview
Welcome to our achievement page of parts, which are essential to realize our ambition.
As mentioned in the project description and result, our three important circuits well supported our project and each of them contributes a lot to the biobricks.
This year, 26 biobricks were submmitted by us. Not only the basic parts such as the component of light control yeast two-hybrid, various Si-tag proteins and inhibitory regulator,but also composite parts . We completely collected the parts from our Euk.cement project and well documented them with our test data.
Sincerely hope these parts can attract you and may assist you in your future synthetic biology creation.
