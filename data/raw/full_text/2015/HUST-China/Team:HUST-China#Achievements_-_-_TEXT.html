As for The Sliver Medal:
√ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
√ Document the characterization of new parts in the Main Page section of the Registry entry for that Part/Device, and submit these new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry .
√ In our Human Practice this year, we majorly concentrated on promoting the concept of synthetic biology through interdisciplinary communication and field practice at fishery industry. We communicated with Professor Zheng Junjie from Civil Engineering College, visited Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute(MFRI) and took a field trip to Zhoushan Fishery.

As for The Gold Medal:
√ After deciding the main application of our kit we want to carry out, we visited Professor Weiding Wang, an expert in aquafarm and artificial reefs form Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Research Institute (MFRI) and issued questionnaires and conducted interviews among local fishermen and practitioners. During this process, we gained a better perception of the development of synthetic biology in China, and also learned valuable practical knowledge from experts, public.

√ This summer, we helped WHU team constructing a standardized plasmid C1-pSB1C3 when they met difficulties. And we helped WHU-China team and HZAU-China lyophilize the samples before shipment as their lyophilizer cannot handle the 96well plate.
√ We found two SpeI illegal sites in Part BBa_K191007, so we removed that by site-directed mutagenesis and created 3 different mutants of Part BBa_K191007. We inserted RBS + GFP for test and verify, but unfortunately we can’t get the competitive inhibitor of tryptophan in the formation of the specific Apo repressor. Moreover, we also documented the Pgal1 promoter (BBa_K1144001) and Gal4 binding domain (BBa_K801032).

√ To test and simulate how well could our project working under real-world conditions, we designed an experiment which combined biology and civil engineering in the lab. With the device we DIY, the simulation of small-scale’s production got a good result beyond our expectation. The prototype of our project can truly solve the problem to a certain extent in an untraditional way.

Experimental Achievements:
√ Successfully proved that our Light control system works.
√ Used the fluorescence immunoassay to verify the success of cell surface display system. 
√ Constructed a series of silica-tag proteins containing different structural truncations, and tested their different combining effects with silica.
√ Successfully identified the flocculating protein MCFP3 that is secreted outside the Y.lipolytca JMY1212 cells by SDS-PAGE.
√ Designed an experiment which combined biology and civil engineering to simulate the effect of our project. The results significantly proved that our project works in the real-world conditions.

Modeling Achievements:
 On cellular level:
√ Meet the need of our experiment and solve the problem of which Darkness Induction System to choose.
√ Predict the final scope and concentration of Euk.Cement and Mcfp3 permeation, and provided the model with some data by carrying out several experiments and amend the model significantly.
On ecosystem level:
√ Put forward an algorithm special for diffusion to simulate the real-world situation and guide our verification design
√ Every modeling about diffusion and permeation could learn from our model.

Policy and Practice Achievements:
 In our Human Practice this year, we majorly concentrated on promoting the concept of synthetic biology through interdisciplinary communication and field practice at fishery industry. During this process, we gained a better perception of the development of synthetic biology in China, and also learned valuable practical knowledge from experts, public and other iGEM teams. :
√ Communication with experts in different disciplines
√ Field practice to Zhoushan Fishery
√ Questionnaire on Fishery Development and Ecological Restoration at Zhoushan Fishery
√ Project-in-action:
1) meeting with other iGEM teams
2)Meetup in Wuhan
3)2015 iGEM conference held by NCTU
4)CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium)
