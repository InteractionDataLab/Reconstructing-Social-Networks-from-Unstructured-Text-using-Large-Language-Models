Best Part Collection:
This year, we submitted 26 new parts in total, including basic parts and composite parts. All the parts we used in our Euk.cement project were completely submitted and shipped. Particularly, we did well in the standardization of E.coli 50S ribosomal protein (Si-tag) with the different combination of domains: 1, 2, 3, 1+2,1+3,2+3,1+2+3,1L3.
We added a signal peptide and cell wall protein respectively at N-erminal and C-terminal of the Si-tags which can immobilize the working protein onto cell wall to promote the protein’s function.
The results of immunofluorescence assay showed that we succeeded in displaying the silica-tag onto the cell surface. Silica surface binding test shows each protein domain had different binding ability, so that we can choose different combinations of Si-tag domains to satisfy different requirement of binding intensity in further real utilization.
