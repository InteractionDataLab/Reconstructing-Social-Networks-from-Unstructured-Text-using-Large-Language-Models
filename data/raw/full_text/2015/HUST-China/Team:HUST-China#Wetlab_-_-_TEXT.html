Wetlab Overview
When we finished the outline of our project, we began to perform the experiments. Throughout the efforts we made in the whole summer, we made progresses step by step.
Here we will show you our interesting results and how did we complete the experiments .
Also, we participated in the InterLab Study , which made our project integrative and compareable.
If you curious about our daily life in the laboratory and want to know more about our experiment details, please follow to the notebook page!
