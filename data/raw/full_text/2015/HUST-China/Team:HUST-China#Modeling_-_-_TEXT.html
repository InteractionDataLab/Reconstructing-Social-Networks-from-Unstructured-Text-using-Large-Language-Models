Click me to see the modeling on the circuit of Euk.Cement~
With the benefit of Synthetic Biology, we built a kit, Euk.Cement, that could solidify sands in the ocean. In order to make sure that our kit could fulfill its duty, we built two mathematical models to simulate it. One model is the DDEs model, this model could simulate the circuit of Euk.Cement and determine the properties of darkness induction system and the amount of secreted proteins.  Another model is the Diffusion model, which could predict the outcome of our kit, such as the final shape, scope and concentration of the permeation of Euk.Cement. In this model, we used Lattice Method to simplify the calculation greatly. With these models, we could improve the experiment significantly and find out the best strategy to make full use of Euk.Cement, such as how to “wake up” Euk.Cement and how to release them.
