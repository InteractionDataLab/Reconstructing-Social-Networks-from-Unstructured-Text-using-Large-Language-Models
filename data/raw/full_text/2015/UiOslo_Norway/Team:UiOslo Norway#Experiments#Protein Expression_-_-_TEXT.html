Protein Expression:
Back to Protocols
Inoculate 5 ml preculture and incubate at 37 °C overnight shaking at 220 rpm
Measure OD600 and calculate the amount needed to inoculate an expression culture with and OD600 of 0.3
Inoculate the expression culture and incubate at 37 °C for 1 hour shaking at 220 rpm
Determine OD600
Recommended is an OD600 between 0.4-1.0 to induce protein expression
Take a 1 ml sample in an uninduced stage
Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM
Incubate the culture for 3 hours at 37 °C shaking at 220 rpm
Harvest cells by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 5 minutes
