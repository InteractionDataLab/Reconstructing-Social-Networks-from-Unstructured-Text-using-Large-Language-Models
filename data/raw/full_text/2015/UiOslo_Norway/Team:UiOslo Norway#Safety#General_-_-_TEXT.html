Risk

Countermeasures
Infection with E. coli.
Low; We do not use pathogenic E. coli. E. coli already exist harmlessly as commensals in the human body.
Washing hands; wearing gloves; observing sterile technique. Using mutant E. coli that are dependent on a specific growth medium, without which they will die.
Release of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the lab to the environment.
Potentially significant; Spread of antibiotic resistance.

Release of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the filter to the environment.
Potentially significant; Spread of antibiotic resistance.
The filter is a closed system; only air goes in and out. Using mutant E. coli that are dependent on a specific growth medium, without which they will die.
Accidents in the lab
cuts
spills
fires
Potentially significant; Damage to skin, eyes, lungs (inhalation of dangerous compounds).
All members go through HMS-tour of the lab; Proper instruction and supervision; Minimum two people at a time in the lab, with supervision; First aid kits, fire blanket, extinguisher, eye wash.
Accidents resulting from methane The gas may displace air and/or cause explosions, highly flammable.
Potentially high impact; Fire and burn injuries.
Using specific systems and chambers when working with methane. Monitoring pressure. Avoiding open flames.
Exposure to dangerous organisms (the lab is a level 2 facility and contains organisms that can cause mild disease in humans).
Moderate; The lab does not contain highly pathogenic or dangerous organisms, but exposure should be avoided.
Washing hands; wearing gloves; observing sterile technique. Containment of dangerous organisms - working in assigned places.
