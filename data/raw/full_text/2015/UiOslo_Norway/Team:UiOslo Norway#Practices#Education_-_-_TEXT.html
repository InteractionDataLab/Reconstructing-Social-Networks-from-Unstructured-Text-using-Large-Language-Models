Education
A big part of our public engagement efforts is education. This is only the second year that the University of Oslo has participated in the iGEM competition since it’s inception with the MicroOrganiser team in 2014. We therefore want to raise the profile of our University’s iGEM course so that practically every student knows or has heard about it. Central to this approach is having open lecures for first year university students to inform them about iGEM and our iGEM-project. Discussing our project is easy since we are all very excited about our project, but it also gives a very illustrative example of what the iGEM competition can be to curious students. We held 6 lectures for new students at the Biosciences Department, and held another lecture at a conference for new students at Sundvolden Hotel, and a lecture for first year Master's students. We’re planning to hold more lectures for different students and make posters for departments that haven’t been actively courted yet.
We also reached out to high schools in Oslo, in order to give high-school students an impression and increased awareness of the possibilities that are afforded them when studying sciences or biosciences at the University. iGEM is a neat example of how they can applying their knowledge to real issues once they are in higher education. Seven schools signed up and in total 167 students will come to the university in October to get introduced into the laboratory.
