Restriction Digest:
Back to Protocols
5 μl    Cutsmart x μl   DNA (1 μg total concentration) 1 μl   Restriction Enzyme I 1 μl   Restriction Enzyme II up to 50 μl   MilliQ Water
Total Reaction of 50 μl
Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C For restriction digests including NdeI, at first only 1 μl of NdeI was added and the digest incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour, afterwards NdeI was heat inactivated at 65 °C for 20 minutes and then the second restriction enzyme was added and the digest was again incubated for 1 hour.
