When doing research that involves controversial technologies such as synthetic biology, genetic engineering or embryonic stem cells, the public is seldom aware of the checks and controls that help regulate scientific research and limit the damage any one scientist might do, either deliberately or by accident. It is the responsibility of researchers to explain these non-intuitive aspects of their work. It is imperative in fields such as synthetic biology to inform the public, as to which fears are overblown or without merit while constructively directing the attention of the public to areas of real risk. This will make it easier to reach a constructive and informed consensus on how to legislate ethical guidelines for the use of certain technologies and research.
As part of a general effort to inform the public about our work and build interest for UiOslo iGEM’s projects, we’ve been actively engaged in (media) outreach. We have devided our activities under the categories education , television , radio , and paper media. In addition did we use several social media platforms, we had a blog, a facebook page, and a twitter account. We are planning to use the twitter account heavily to keep the home front informed about out expreineces in Boston!

Our project was inspired by the possibility of capturing methane emissions in facilities where methane is produced, and converting this methane into a useful product. The idea relies on our ability to convert methane into methanol or biomass using our filter-system in closed air spaces where methane is produced.  To get a better idea of the actual feasibility of implementing our filter, should it work, we set out to tour the facilities of relevant industries and discover how our filter system could be of use. Some of the industrial areas of interest that were immediately obvious to us were; landfills (some of which reside in closed air spaces), sewage treatment facilities, and cattle farms.  Of these we were lucky enough to visit Bekkelaget Renseanlegg, the sewage and wastewater treatment facility for Oslo, and the Bygdøy Royal Farm.
