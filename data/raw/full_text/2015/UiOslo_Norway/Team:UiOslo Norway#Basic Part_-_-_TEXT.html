Basic Parts
Our Team generated three basic BioBrick parts.
BBa_K1619001
medh2
Our BBa_K1619001 is a basic BioBrick part which contains the coding sequence of the medh2 gene from Bacillus methanolicus. medh2 encodes a NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase catalyzing the conversion of methanol into formaldehyde under conversion of NAD+ into NADH.
BBa_K1619002
hps
Our BBa_K1619002 is a basic BioBrick part which contains the coding sequence of the hps gene from Bacillus methanolicus. hps encodes a 3-hexoluse-6phosphate synthase catalyzing the fixation of formaldehyde into 3-hexulose-6-phosphate.
BBa_K1619003
phi
Our BBa_K1619003 is a basic BioBrick part which contains the coding sequence of the phi gene from Bacillus methanolicus. phi encodes a 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase) catalyzing the conversion of 3-hexulose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate.
