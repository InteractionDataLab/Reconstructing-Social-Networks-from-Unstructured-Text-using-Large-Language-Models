iGEM Team Uppsala and iGEM Team Stockholm
We joined the Nordic iGEM Conference which took part in the end of July 2015. The Nordic iGEM conference was hosted by the iGEM Teams Uppsala and Stockholm . Teams from SDU-Denmark , Chalmers-Gothenburg , Link√∂ping , Aalto-Helsinik joined the conference and it was a great platform to exchange ideas.
