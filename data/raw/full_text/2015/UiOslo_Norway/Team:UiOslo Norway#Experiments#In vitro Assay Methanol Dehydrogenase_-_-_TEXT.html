In vitro Methanol Dehydrogenase assay using E. coli raw extract
Back to Protocols
Inoculate a preculture LB media containing  the appropriate antibiotic and incubate at 37 °C overnight shaking at 220 rpm.
Inoculate a mainculture (50 ml) and induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM at an OD600 of 0.4- 1.0
Incubate at 37 °C for 3 hours
Harvest the culture by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 5 minutes
Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml 50 mM K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4)
Add glass beads (0.1mm diameter) and disrupt the cells by shaking for 12 minutes
Centrifugation at 16000 x g for 5 minutes
Keep the soluble fraction for the assay
Perform the enzyme assay in a total volume of 1 ml
Add preheated 50 mM K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgSO4
Add 50 µl of soluble fraction
Add 1 M methanol
Add 200 µM NAD+
Detect the absorption at 340 nm
In vitro Methanol Dehydrogenase assay using purified NAD+ dependent Methanol Dehydrogenase
Back to Protocols
Perform the enzyme assay in a total volume of 1 ml
Add preheated 50 mM K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgSO4
Add 100 µg of purified MEDH2
Add 0.5 M methanol
Add 0.5 mM NAD+
Detect the absorption at 340 nm
