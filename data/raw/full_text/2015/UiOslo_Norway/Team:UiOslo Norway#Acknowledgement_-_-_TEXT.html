We would like to thank all the people who helped with our iGEM project.
Project support and advice
The University of Oslo provided us with the opportunity to participate in iGEM. Professor Dirk Linke supervised, helped, and supported us and gave good discussions. Professor Paul Grini supported and helped us in our progress of our iGEM project. Dr. Eric de Muinck advised us related to the lab work and arranged our travel to Boston. Kirsten Borse Haraldsen from the science library supported us in relation to finding (and buying) project related literature. Team Braunschweig 2014 provided plamsids with the sMMO genes, and were a source for our project idea and primer design. Team METUHS-Ankara 2014 was a source of ideas.
