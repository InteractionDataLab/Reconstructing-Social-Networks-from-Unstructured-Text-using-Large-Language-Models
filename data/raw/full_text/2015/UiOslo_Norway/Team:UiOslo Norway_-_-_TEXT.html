Methane  (CH4)  is  the  second  most  prevalent  emitted  greenhouse  gas  on  earth.  Today we are facing the challenge of solving this problem of high methane concentrations in the atmosphere that leads to global warming.  The  global  warming  potential  of  methane  is  about  84  times higher than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) when compared over 20 years.   Technical methods to reuse emitted methane gas are cost- and time- intensive and therefore rarely used.
The goal of our  project is  to  develop an Escherichia coli (E. coli) based  model  that filters methane out of the air and converts this into biomass.  First part of the project is to break down methane to methanol with the enzyme complex soluble  methane  monooxygenase (sMMO)  of  the  methanotroph Methylococcus  capsulatus expressed in E.  coli.  In  order  for  the  multisubunit  enzyme complex to break down methane to methanol, oxygen and iron-ions are required. Second  part of the project is to convert methanol into biomass using the Ribulose-Monophosphate (RuMP)- pathway and establish this pathway in E.coli. The  pathway  is  found  in  the  methanotroph Bacillus  methanolicus and enables E. coli to convert methanol into biomass.
To test the functionality of the modified E. coli, the bacteria will be grown in a closed  system  under  methane  rich  conditions.  Additionally, a  filter  will be  created  that  can  contain the modified E.coli and can filter the surrounding air through the system, so that the methane can be broken down. The filter could be used in areas where methane emission is a problem.
