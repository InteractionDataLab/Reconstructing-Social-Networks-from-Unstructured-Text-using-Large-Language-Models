Ni-NTA Affinity Chromatography
Back to Protocols
Equilibriated the Ni-NTA with E. coli raw extract by rolling for 40 minutes.
Transfer mixture to an Econo-ColumnÂ® Chromatography Columns (BIORAD).
Wash with 100 mL 10 mM imidazolebuffer and collect the fraction.
Wash with 30 mL 50 mM imidazolebuffer and collect the fraction.
Elute with 300 mM imidazolebuffer and collect the fraction.
Check the obtained fractions by SDS-Page.
Imidazole buffer 50 mM   Tris-HCl pH 8 100 mM NaCl 10 mM    beta-Mercaptoethanol 10 mM         Imidazole
