In addition we had the intention to add the GroEL-like chaperon <I>mmoG</I>, which is assumed to have an essential role in correct folding of the multi subunit enzyme complex sMMO. In an initial step we wanted to show particular protein expression of each subunit into <I>E. coli</I>. All subunits were cloned into our designated expression vector pET-30 and all subunits, except MMOC, were expressed (Figure 1).</P><B><FONT size="2">Figure 1:</FONT></B><FONT> Pilotexpression of MMOX, MMOY, MMOZ, MMOB, MMOC, MMOD in <I>E. coli</I>.

In addition we wanted to clone the GroEL like chaperon MMOG. We isolated <I>mmoG</I> from <I>Methylococcus capsulatus</I> genomic DNA. Afterwards we cloned <I>mmoG</I> into pET-30. In this construct we found in the middle of our gene a deletion of 8 base pairs. 
Due to time concerns we decided to synthesize mmoG, using the IDT 20 kb free offer for iGEM Teams. We were trying to amplify mmoG using our design primers which was not sufficient. Due to time concerns we were not able to finish our mmoG BioBrick, as well as showing successful expression of mmoG in E. coli. </P><DIV class="highlightBox"><H3>Summary:</H3><UL><LI><P>We generated expression constructs for all sMMO subunits.</P></LI><LI><P>We showed soluble expression of MMOX, MMOZ, MMOB, MMOD. </P></LI><LI><P>Generation of <I> mmoG </I> as a BioBrick part needs further improvement.</P></LI></UL></DIV><H2>2.

	 </A><P> Our second goal was to engineer E. coli for the conversion of methanol into biomass, a process that involves three different steps.
In the first step methanol is converted into formaldehyde by the NAD+ dependent methanol dehydrogenase MEDH2 from Bacillus methanolicus MGA3. 
We genereated a basic BioBrick part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1619001"> (BBa_K1619001) </A>, which contains the <I>medh2</I> coding sequence. 
We further cloned medh2 into pET-28 and showed soluble expression of MEDH2 in E. coli at 18 °C (Figure 3). </P><B><FONT size="2">Figure 3:</FONT></B><FONT>  Pilotexpression and Solubility assay of heterologous expressed MEDH2 in<I> E. coli</I>.

Initially we tried to show methanol dehydrogenase activity using an in vitro approach, which is based on the detection of generated NADH. We tried using <I>E. coli</I> raw extract which was not sufficient (see Notebook Week 13). Therefore we performed a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography to isolate and purify N-Terminal 6xHis-tagged MEDH2 (Figure 4). </P><B><FONT size="2">Figure 4:</FONT></B><FONT>  Ni-NTA purifcation of MEDH2.

	 </A><P> We were able to assemble our airfilter system as we planned it. We made videos of the bubbling culture inside the filter (Video 1), and of the complete assembled filter system running (Video 2). </P><P> We added a culture of the methanotroph <I> Methylococcus capsulatus </I> to the filter as a proof our concept. <I> Methylococcus capsulats </I> was grown for 5 days in NMS media supplemented with 25 % (v/v) methanol. Before adding it to the filter, the culture was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in NMS-media without methanol. We expected a decrease in the methane concentration over time, since it was the only provided carbon source. Unfortunately we detected a leakage in our system by measuring the methane concentration over a period of 24 hours without adding a culture (Figure 7). So far we have not been able to fix the leakage. </P><B><FONT size="2">Figure 7:</FONT></B><FONT> Testing the assembled airfilter system: The concentration of methane was measured every second over a period of 24 hours.
