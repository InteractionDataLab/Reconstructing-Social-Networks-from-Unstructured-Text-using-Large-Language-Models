Radio
We have been interviewed for a popular scientific radio program called EKKO from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). The program is known by many (young) people. In addition to the interview with two of the iGEM team members about our project and synthetic biology, an (one year old) interview with one of the founders of iGEM will also be included. Sadly, we cannot add the broadcast here on our wiki, because it will be aired the 23th of September 2015. We are very excited! Most likely the broadcast can be listened to after the initial airing on the NRK EKKO webpage.
