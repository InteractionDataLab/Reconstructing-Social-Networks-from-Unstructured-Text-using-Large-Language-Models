Attitudes towards creating a               wiki
According to our survey, most teams (51/66) find it difficult or tedious to create wiki with high quality, especially in very limited time. We also counted the number of word used for writing the wikis in the past 4 years, the average number of word in these wikis is 9531 (HTML tags, javascript and css files are not included, code can be seen on GitHub ). As you can imagine, this needs a huge amount of work! So, we’d like to make some changes.

Online Collaboration
A typical iGEM wiki can be divided into no less than 8 sections                 (like the home page, project, safety, team, and so on). Under                 each section, there are a lot of issues which you want to                 present. Just like the ‘Project’ section, you may                 need to tell others about your background information, design,                 etc. Tedious as it is, we, the same as other 61 teams (61/66),                 believe that collaboration can improve the efficiency of                 creating a wiki. Flight iGEM provides you an online platform, in                 which you can collaborate with your teammates, so every teammate                 can create page and edit them at any time or anywhere. To avoid                 version conflict(covered by others’ edition), we mimic the                 concept of SVN.

Flight iGEM Magic
About half of iGEM teams (32/66) we surveyed hold the opinion that                   creating a wiki requires superior skills in programming, which leads them to feel hard about it. Among 66 teams surveyed by us, the average time used in writing their wikis is 75 days. However, with Flight iGEM, we only used about 10 days to complete our wiki. So, we sincerely                   invite you to click the right arrow and discover what giant                   changes Flight iGEM can make.
Step 1
To create a wiki, a HTML template is necessary neither                   with Flight iGEM nor without Flight iGEM. Templates used for Flight iGEM should follow some simple rules, which can be found in our document.
Step 2
Without Flight iGEM
Once the template is done, other teammates can start to                   summarize the project, record experiments’ data by using                   their Word or iWork.
With Flight iGEM
Flight                 iGEM requires you and your teammates to work online. We use                 CKEditor(a free, Open Source HTML text editor) to set up edit environment like Word or iWork.
Step 3
Without Flight iGEM
Without Flight iGEM, you need to upload all images and                   other media files which involved in your articles to the iGEM                   server manually.
With Flight iGEM
If you use Flight iGEM, all media files(especially the                   images) which you insert into the article will be automatically                   upload to iGEM server.
Step 4
Without Flight iGEM
You need to assign the content which converted from Word                   or iWork documents to the template. In this step, there will be                   numerous words and sentences that will be copied and pasted,                   which cost a lot of time and memory.
With Flight iGEM
Flight iGEM can assign contents with template                   automatically, all you need to do is to select what you want to                   display, and then click 'Magic'.
Step 5
Without Flight iGEM
After you merged this two component, you should                   upload the "code soup" to the iGEM server, and this                   is the final step of the whole procedure.
With Flight iGEM
Flight iGEM will upload your pages to the iGEM server                   after step 4, and the only thing you need to do is to visit                   your target page and check if the page is exactly what you                   want.

Deadline alarm
According to our investigation among 66 teams, 19 of them                 thought there were too many deadlines in iGEM and they might be                 forgotten easily. Moreover，43 teams surveyed indicated that it                 would be better if there were certain reminders for the                 deadlines. As we all know, iGEM is a competition composed of a                 lot of events. To help users manage their time better,                 Flight iGEM also covers a deadline reminder. It is most noteworthy                  that this reminder is able to convert time zones automatically                 according to the users' geographic positions.

What's for the iGEM Server?
Considering that 83.3% teams (55/66) have encountered the                 situation that the iGEM server got slower or went down when                 it is close to the freeze of wiki, we decide to                 linearize all our request. It means if you want to build                  a page and post it to iGEM server, you have to queue for a while                 until people who requested before you finish their queries. To                 speed up all the requests, we create more than ten queues, which                 we believe is enough to handle them. And we hold the opinion                 that our platform will contribute a lot to ease the burden of                 iGEM servers, if it is accepted by other teams.

Present and Future
By using Flight iGEM, teams can spend more time on their experiment, which will help them to focus on synthetic biology. Flight iGEM has been available online since late august, and iGEM teams from 14 countries have visited our platform. But before the Flight iGEM was available online, many teams had finished their wiki work, so we did not get too much users (while NUDT_CHINA is one of our users this year, and they have given us some precious advises which helped us a lot), but our survey indicates that more than 93.93% of iGEM teams(62/66) are willing to use it next year. We host our source code on GitHub, so you can fork Flight iGEM on github . And we also provide a  concise document for the project, which we hope will help you to get aware of the project quickly.
