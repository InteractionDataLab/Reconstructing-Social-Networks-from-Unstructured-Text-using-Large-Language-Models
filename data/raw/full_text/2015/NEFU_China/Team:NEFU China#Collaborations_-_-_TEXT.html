Collaborations
During the CCiC summit, we happened to know the vector pBBR1MCS-5 we are using in our project is an urgent need for the team NUDT_China. We sent them the plasmid immediately after the summit, and they sent us the vector pBBR1MCS-2 in exchange.
This year, our team has developed an online platform named Flight iGEM which can help all the iGEM teams to simplify the procedure of wiki building. See more details about(  Flight iGEM ) With Flight iGEM, each member of a team will be able to participate in their wiki creation, and this will significantly increase their efficiency. We introduced this wonderful platform to other iGEM teams during the CCiC summit. Many teams showed great interests in it, indicating that they were willing to use it. This platform has already assisted the team NUDT_China with wiki creation. We sincerely thank them for their suggestions on the improvement of our platform. (See their wiki here)
