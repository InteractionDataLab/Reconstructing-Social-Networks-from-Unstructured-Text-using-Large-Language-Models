Our parts are designed for the construction of the AI-2 response pathway in the engineered bacteria. The following Biobrick parts have been submitted to the registry:
 
BBa_K1666000 : This is a coding region part for lsrA. LsrA is a part of the ABC transporter complex involved in autoinducer 2 (AI-2) import and responsible for energy coupling to the transport system.
BBa_K1666001 : This is a coding region part for lsrB. LsrB is a solute-binding protein that can bind AI-2 specifically and help to transport the AI-2 into the cytoplasm.
BBa_K1666002 and BBa_K1666003 : LsrC and LsrD are parts of the ABC transporter complex LsrABCD, probably responsible for the translocation of the substrate across the membrane.
 
BBa_K1666004 : This is a coding region part for lsrK. LsrK catalyzes the phosphorylation of autoinducer 2(AI-2) to phospho-AI-2, which subsequently inactivates the transcriptional regulator LsrR and leads to the transcription of the lsr operon.
BBa_K1666005 : This is a coding region part for lsrR. In the absence of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), LsrR represses transcription of the lsr operon and itself. Phospho-AI-2 can bind LsrR and inactivate it through releasing it from the repressed promoters, leading to the transcription of the lsr genes.
BBa_K1666006 : This is an inducible promoter. Plsr is the promoter of the lsr operon. It is under the repressive regulation of LsrR. In our project, we use it to regulate the expression of the reporter gene, amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ).
