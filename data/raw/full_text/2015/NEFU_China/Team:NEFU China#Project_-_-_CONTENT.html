If we can find a common feature among these bacteria, we may develop a method to detect them simultaneously. <SPAN style="font-size:12px">We searched literatures and discovered that a signal molecule, autoinducer 2 is a signaling molecule in quorum sensing, and also is common among these pathogenic bacteria.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Quorum sensing is a process of bacterial cell-to-cell communication involving the production and detection of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. As the density of the bacterial population increases, so does the amount of secreted autoinducer molecules. When the concentration of the autoinducer reaches a critical threshold, it will be  transported back into the cell and  will activate or repress certain target genes. While most autoinducers are species specific, autoinducer 2(AI-2) is generated by many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and serves as a 'universal signal' for interspecies communication.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">AI-2 is a byproduct of the Activated Methyl Cycle, which recycles S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAM). As a main methyl donor in eubacteria, archeabacteria and eukaryotes, SAM is converted to S-Adenosyl-L-Homocysteine (SAH), which is subsequently detoxified by the Pfs enzyme (also called S-Adenosylhomocysteine Nucleosidase) to generate Adenine and S-Ribosyl-Homocysteine(SRH), the sole intracellular source of the substrate of LuxS. LuxS then produces the precursor of AI-2, 4,5-Dihydroxy-2,3-Pentanedione(DPD), during the conversion of SRH to Homocysteine (HCY).</SPAN></P><P style="text-align:center"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Fig3.  Activated Methyl Cycle </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">DPD can be converted from SRH by LuxS in the cytoplasm and then exported to culture medium, where DPD undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form AI-2. Depending on the bacteria, response to AI-2 can follow one of the two currently identified routes. In pathogens exemplified by <EM>Salmonella</EM>, AI-2 response involves ATP binding cassette transporter encoded by four LuxS-regulated (lsr) genes. <EM>lsrB</EM> encodes the periplasmic AI-2 binding protein,<EM> lsrC</EM> and <EM>lsrD</EM> encode two membrane channel proteins, and <EM>lsrA</EM> encodes the ATPase that provides energy for AI-2 transport. The extracellular AI-2 can bind LsrB to re-enter the cytoplasm and be phosphorylated by LsrK. Then the phosphorylated AI-2 can activate the<EM> lsr </EM>operon through binding the repressor protein LsrR and release it from the promoter. This will lead to the synthesis of LsrA,C,B, D and increase AI-2 entry.</SPAN></P><P style="text-align:center"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Fig 4. AI-2 response in <EM>Salmonella typhimurium</EM></SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">AI-2 response pathway in<EM> Lactobacillus</EM> is different from that in pathogenic bacteria. So we will take the advantage of this difference and use the mechanism of AI-2 pathway in these pathogenic bacteria to build our detecting system. We choose <EM>Lactobacillus </EM>as our chassis. As beneficial bacteria, they are in food-grade and widely used in food fermentation. <EM>Lactobacillus</EM><EM>bulgaricus </EM>can improve nutrient absorption and human gastrointestinal function, and inhibit the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria in guts. If fully developed into real products, our engineered <EM>Lactobacillus</EM> can be directly used in yogurt fermentation, which will make our detecting process even more convenient.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We cloned genes related to the AI-2 response in <EM>Salmonella</EM> and integrated these genes in <EM>Lactobacillus </EM>genomes. In our engineered bacteria, the <EM>lsrA, C, B, D </EM>genes will constitutively express to form the membrane transporter. We will clone the promoter sequence of the <EM>lsr</EM> operon and use it to drive the expression of the report gene. According to the previous studies, we have chosen an identified pigment in the Registry: the biobrick of amilCP (BBa_K592009). It encodes a blue pigment that can be recognized by naked eyes. Thus, when pathogenic bacteria express AI-2 molecules and secrete them extracellularly, these molecules can be transported into our engineered bacteria and trigger the expression of the report gene to produce the blue pigment. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:center"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Fig5. Working mechanism of our engineered bacteria</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In our design, the P<EM>nisA </EM>promoters, which can be activated by nisin, are used to drive the expression of<EM> lsrA</EM>,<EM> C</EM>,<EM> B</EM>,<EM> D</EM>,<EM> R </EM>and <EM>K</EM> genes. Nisin is a anti-microbial peptide consisting of 34 amino acids. Because of its broad host spectrum, it is widely used as a food preservative.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The nisin-controlled gene expression (NICE) system is one of the most commonly used regulatory gene expression system of Gram-positive bacteria. In the natural situation, nisin binds to the receptor NisK, which activates NisR through phosphorylation. The activated NisR drives the <EM>nisA</EM> promoter. Sub-toxic amounts of nisin in the ng/mL range are sufficient to fully activate the otherwise tightly repressed promoter.</SPAN></P><P style="text-align:center"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Fig6. Nisin induced regulation system</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Previous studies indicate that the <EM>nisR </EM>and<EM> K</EM> are the only<EM> nis</EM> genes required for nisin-mediated signal transduction and P<EM>nisA</EM> promoter activation. However, our chassis, <EM>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </EM>Lb14<EM>, </EM>does not have <EM>nisR</EM> or<EM> nisK</EM> genes in its genome. In order to implement this strictly controlled expression system in such lactic acid bacteria, various<EM> nisR </EM>and <EM>K</EM> expression constructs were generated, and we pickedpNZ9530 among them. Thus, apart from the plasmids for the expression of the essential parts in charge of AI-2 response, we also need to transform pNZ9530 into our engineered <EM>Lactobacillus</EM>.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This system for regulated gene expression shows many desirable characteristics: (1) nisin is an ideal molecule to be used as an inducer since it is already widely used in the food industry and can therefore be regarded as a food-grade inducer; (2) the protein expression levels are very high in this system; (3) the expression of the intergrated genes appears to be very tightly controlled, leading to undetectable protein expression in the uninduced state. So once our engineered bacteria are consumed as auxiliary starters in the yogurt fermentation, they will not express these genes modulated by <EM>PnisA</EM>, since the inducer nisin has been destroyed during digestion.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-size:26px"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><STRONG>Plasmid construction</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We have carefully considered the functions of these genes involved in AI-2 response, antibiotic resistance of expression vectors and plasmid incompatibility before transformation. In order to achieve the final goal of constructing the AI-2 response pathway of <EM>Salmonella</EM> in our engineered bacteria, we chose 3 types of plasmids with different replication origins and different antibiotics so that they can replicate in one host cell and provide convenience for screening post transformation. To visualize AI-2 existence, we chose a reporter gene, <EM>amilCP</EM> (BBa_K592009), from previous registered parts. This adds up to 7 plasmids for essential parts of AI-2 response system: (1) pNZ8148 is used to express <EM>lsrB</EM>,<EM> R </EM>and<EM> K</EM>; (2) pBBR1MCS-5 is used to express<EM> lsrA</EM>,<EM> C </EM>and<EM> D</EM>; (3) pHY300PLK is used to express the blue pigment, which is under the control of P<EM>lsr</EM>. We linearized these expression vectors and proceeded to stably integrating them into the genome of the host bacteria.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-size:20px"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><STRONG>pNZ8148-<EM>lsrB</EM>,<EM> R</EM>,<EM> K</EM></STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We chose pNZ8148 for the expression of those three genes. The replicon of the vector pNZ8148 is originally from the<EM> Lactococcus lactis</EM> plasmid pSH71. However, this replicon has a broad host range. Apart from Gram-positive bacteria, pNZ8148 can also replicate in <EM>E. coli</EM>, but require a recA+ strain like MC1061. It is chlorampenicol resistant.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-size:20px"><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><STRONG>pBBR1MCS-5 - <EM>lsrA</EM>,<EM> C</EM>,<EM> D</EM></STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In <EM>Salmonella</EM>, AI-2 response involves an ATP binding cassette transporter.<EM> lsrC</EM> and <EM>lsrD</EM> encode the membrane channel proteins, and <EM>lsrA</EM> encodes the ATPase that provides energy for AI-2 transport.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Those three coding sequences were first inserted in pNZ8148. Afterwards, we used PCR to isolate them together with the upstream<EM> nisA</EM> promoters.

After that, we spliced these two parts using SOE-PCR. Finally, the product was inserted to pHY300PLK using double digestion and ligation.</SPAN></P><P>            </P><P style="text-align:center"> </P><P class="footer" style="color:white;margin-top:20px;text-align:center;"><SPAN>Generated by </SPAN><A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:NEFU_China/Software">Flight iGEM</A>.</P></DIV><A id="returnTop" href="javascript:;">Back to Top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
