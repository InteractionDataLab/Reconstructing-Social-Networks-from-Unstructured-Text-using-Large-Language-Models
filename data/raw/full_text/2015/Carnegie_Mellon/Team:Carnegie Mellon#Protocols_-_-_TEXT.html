Hello world!
His-Tag Soluble Protein Extraction
Centrifuge 1.5 ml of culture for 1min full speed at 15000 rpm.
Remove supernatant.
Add 250 µl of extraction buffer (1% octyl-beta-thioglucoside in 10mM Tris-Cl, pH7.5).
Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.
Wash Beads
Remove 50 µl of Ni-NTA in 10 mM Trischloride bead solution and place in new tube for each purification.
Add 1 mL buffer (see table).
Centrifuge at 800 rpm for 30 seconds.
Remove supernatant.
Repeat 3 times and resuspend in 1 mL of Bead Wash Solution.
Seen below is the protocol we standardized and distributed to labs like the Citizen Science Center in an effort to gain more uniformity between data observed in different labs around the world. The back of the card has details on how to elute the protein off on the washed Ni-NTa beads. A download link for the JPEG can be found below the images.
