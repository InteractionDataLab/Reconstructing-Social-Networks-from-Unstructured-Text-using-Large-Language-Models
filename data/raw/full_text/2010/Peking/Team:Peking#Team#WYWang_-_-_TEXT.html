Statement
The first time when I heart of Synthetic Biology, I thought it sounds like my favorite robot-model assembling, and felt great interest in it spontaneously. Thanks to IGEM and my teammates, I enjoyed a fabulous summer to understand more about SB. It was also a great honor to do the designing work of our wiki. The internet gave me a convenient platform learning computer language, as well as improving my painting strategy.
