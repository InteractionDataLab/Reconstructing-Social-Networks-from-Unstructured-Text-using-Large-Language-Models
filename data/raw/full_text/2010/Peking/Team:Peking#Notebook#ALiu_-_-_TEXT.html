I Conducted mutagenesis library for Mer OP and research on the feature of promoter functional sites through screening the library (characterizging promoters with different dyad MerR binding site). Then promoters with different Hg binding affinity was integrated with the results gained from operation analysis to acquire the wider range of bioreproter Hg-sensitivity.
