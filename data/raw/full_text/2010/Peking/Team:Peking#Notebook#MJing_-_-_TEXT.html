   Jing Miao's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
I designed to engineer this operon under the regulation of T7 promoter, which is regulated by upstream T7 polymerase, to fulfill the goal that the absorbance of Hg(II) will be enhanced for an efficient bioabsorbent. Also I cloned and assembled agn43 into the inductive aggregation module. Agn43 is drove by PO promoter, which is the terminal of a cascade amplification
