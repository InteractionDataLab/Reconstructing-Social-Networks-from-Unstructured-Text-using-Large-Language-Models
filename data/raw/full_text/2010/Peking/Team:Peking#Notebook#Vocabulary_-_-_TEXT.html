Vocabulary
Antigen 43
Antigen 43 is a unique autotransporter that promote bacterial cell-to-cell aggregation. Antigen 43 can be expressed on the E.coli cell surface in large quantities, up to 50000 copies per cell.[1] The structure analysis of antigen 43 revealed that antigen 43 has an N-terminal signal peptide; an N-proximal passenger domain that is secreted, which could also be called α domain; an autochaperone domain that facilitates folding of the passenger domain; and a C-terminal β-barrel domain that forms an integral outer membrane protein, also called β domain[2]. The passenger domain(αdomain) confers the autoaggregation phenotype and it is bound to the surface via non-covalent interaction with the βdomain.
The structure of the coding sequence of antigen 43. Antigen 43 contains a signal peptide, a passenger domain, an autochaperone domain and a translocation unit, which are all indicated in this figure.
MerR
MerR, the eponymous and first identified member of the merR family, can bind mercury ions directly and regulates expression of bacterial mercury ion resistance operons.
MBP
MBP, a kind of mercury mental binding peptide that consists of two tandemed copies of metal binding domain of MerR including dimerization helix and metal binding loop together
DsbA
DsbA (a periplasmic disulfide bond oxidoreductase),a SecA dependent signal protein , can export its C-terminal fusion protein into periplasm on the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway
ICP-AES
Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry: (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that uses the inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular element. The intensity of this emission is indicative of the concentration of the element within the sample.(Wikipedia)
LOM
LOM (lpp-OmpA-MBP), a fusion protein consists of first 9 amino acids of lipoprotein, residues 46~159 of OmpA, an outer membrane protein and our lead binding peptide,MBP.
PAN
1-(2-Pyridylazo)-2-naphthol
Molecular Structure
Molecular Formula       C15H11N3O
Molecular Weight        249.27
CAS Registry Number     85-85-8
EINECS                 201-637-9
Melting point           134-141 ºC
Water solubility         Insoluble
PbrR
PbrR, the other member of the merR family, can bind lead ions directly and regulates expression of bacterial lead ion resistance operons.
Reverse engineering
Reverse engineering is the process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object or system through analysis of its structure, function and operation. It often involves taking something apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without using or simply duplicating (without understanding) any part of the original. (Wikipedia)
TPS
TritonX-100-PAN-S ：A self-synthesized  water-soluble metal indicator with colorimetric selectivity for heavy metals.
Traffic light bioassay
Traffic light bioassay, the assay we have designed utilized similar indications as road signal for directing vehicular traffic by means of colored lights when we expect that several shades of blue imply different concentrations of heavy metal ions detected.
