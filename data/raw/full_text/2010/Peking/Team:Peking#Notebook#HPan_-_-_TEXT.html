   Heng Pan's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
I have constructed a genetic circuit, which utilizes the T3 polymerase/ T3 promoter and phage activator PhiR73/PO pomoter pairs to achieve a time dlay and signal amplification after mercury is present.Besides, I have characterized PpbrA-PbrR pair to stress that the engineering strategy applied in PmerT-MerR pair is robust for MerR family TFs
