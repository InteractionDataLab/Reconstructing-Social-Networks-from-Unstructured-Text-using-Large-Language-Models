   Yin Shen's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
My work mainly focuses on the characterization of merOP. The response curve of merOP was characterized in Ecoli strains possessing different genetic component combinations to figure out the affects of different module to merOP and finally contributed to the rational design of the bioreporter.

7.26-8.2
Measurement of the 3 – dimensional figure which represented the time and dose response curve to mercury both for OD600 and GFP intensity.
I first tried to sample 100μL every 20min to the black-96-well plate and stored the plate in 4℃，OD was measured by spectrophotometer right after sampling.
The optimized protocol was to incubate the bacteria with Hg(II) in the microplate (black one for GFP intensity measurement and transparent one for OD600 measurement), then the two plates were measured by the microplate reader every 20min. During the interval of measurement, the two plates were cultured in the 37℃ shaker.

8.12-8.23
Induced the strain containing (PmerT-GFP+ Pc(1-18I) –RBS-merR) with Pb(II) to certify its specificity.
Construction of pPbrA-GFP(E0840) by the same stratagy used in the construction of PmerT-GFP(E0840).
Changed the backbone of pPbrA-GFP from pSB1A2 to pSB3K3
8.24-8.29
Re-changed the backbone of pPbrA-GFP from pSB1A2 to pSB3K3
Since the the concentration of low replicates pSB3K3(E. P. digested) was too low, the transformation was failed last week, I minipreped this plasmid again and by several tricks such as repeat elution for several times, the concentration finally reached the requirement for ligation.
8.30-9.5
Insert the two promoters - PmerT and pPbrA - before CrtEBI.
