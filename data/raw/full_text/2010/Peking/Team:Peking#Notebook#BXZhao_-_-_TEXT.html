   Boxuan Zhao's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
My work is merging OmpA and anchor protein Lpp with metal binding domain of MerR to accomplish the goal of surface display. Additionally, I participate the functional testing of whole-cell bioabsorbents. By recognizing the homologous regions among them, I designed the metal binding domain complex for four different MerR family proteins, which can be used to verify the reasonableness of our project design.
