   Xin Teng's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
After carefully studied the structure of MerR, I constructed MerR-MBP (Metal Binding Peptide). Additionaly, I helped to construct and standardize the periplasmic metal binding peptide – DsbA-MerR-MBP using a similar strategy as MerR-MBP. After inductive expression of MerR-MBP-His6, DsbA-PbrR-MBP-His6 and DsbA-MerR-MBP-His6, I use SDS-PAGE and western blot to confirm the expression and localization of MBP and DsbA-MBP.
There are many pictures and graphs in my notes, I strongly recommand you to download them for more precise reading.

7.5-7.11
DsbA-MerR (Periplasmic MerR) construction
Successful clones have been verified by sequencing.
Standardization for DsbA-MerR
Double digest shows the right result. Need to be sequenced.
MBP-His (cytosol MBP for expression test) construction
Double digest result shows that clone have failed. No band of right molecular weight can be detected.
MBP (cytosol MBP for mercury binding test) construction
Clones have been constructed, but need to be verified by double digestion.
Mercury Semiquantative Detection
Solution Preparation
1 g/L Dithizone Cloroform solution
1.038×10-3 mol/L HgCl2
Dithizone Eluant
Na2S detoxic solution
1 mol/L NaOH
Concentrated HNO3
Standard Mercury Concentration Determination
Mercury concentrated 25 times
Color change can be easily seen, but out of linear range of the standard curve.
7.12-7.18
DsbA-MBP (periplasmic MBP for expression test) construction
Band of expected molecular weight can be detected by double digest. Need to be sequenced.
Re-design the construction strategy for DsbA-MerR(MBP)
MBP-His & MBP construction
Failed.
Mercury Semiquantative Determination
Standard solution concentrated 10 times.
There is no significant difference between detected mercury concentration prepared in LB or water. But the absolute value is too low.
7.19-7.25
DsbA-MerR construction. Need to be verified.
DsbA-MBP construction. Need to be verified.
SDS-PAGE & Western Blot
Buffer preparation
5 × SDS-PAGE buffer
Tris – HCl pH 6.8
Tris – HCl pH 8.8
30% Acr / Bis-Acr
5 × TBS
5 × Transfer Buffer
1 × TTBS
SDS-PAGE result of DsbA-MerR
Overexpression band can be detected at the expected molecular weight (40 kD).
7.26-7.28 & 8.3-8.8
Double digest verification for DsbA-MBP, MBP-His & MBP.
Failed.
Check the template of MBP by sequencing.
Re-design for MBP & DsbA-MBP construction.
