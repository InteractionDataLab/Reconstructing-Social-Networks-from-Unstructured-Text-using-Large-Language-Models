Statement The era of interdiscipline has come. And our generation serves as the impulse. Standing on the blurring boundary of Chemistry and Biology, I find that developing chemical tools to study biological issues is becoming more and more vital. Certainly, synthetic biology is one of the most important methods to realize this. Also, science should serve human beings. Practical purpose is the prerequisite and technology transfer is the bridge to make it true. I believe that the project of our team this year has combined the above-mentioned significance, and together we will fight to achieve the grand success in the ultimate.
