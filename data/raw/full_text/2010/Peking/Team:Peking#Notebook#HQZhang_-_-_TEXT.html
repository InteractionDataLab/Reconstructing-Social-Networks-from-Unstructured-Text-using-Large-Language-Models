   Haoqian Zhang's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
I have played several roles during this summer. As a team leader, I presided designing and optimization of the project. I know every member of Peking iGEM team is extraordinarily talented and enthusiastic at synthetic biology, which means that all they need is proper coordination and guide. Therefore, I did not join the bioware experiments very much, but worked as both a technician and an advisor.
