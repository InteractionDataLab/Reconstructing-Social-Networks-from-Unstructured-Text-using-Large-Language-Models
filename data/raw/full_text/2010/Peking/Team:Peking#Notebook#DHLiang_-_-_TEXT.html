   Donghai Liang's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
Being responsible for the periplasmic module of the bioabsorbent display, I successfully completed the construction of DsbA-MBP and DsbA-MerR (serving as a control). At the same time, the standardization of the module mentioned above is also completed. Besides, I participate in the TF-DNA binding affinity characterization of the mercury promoter
