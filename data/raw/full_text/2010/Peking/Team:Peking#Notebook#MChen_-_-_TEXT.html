I characterized the CrtEBI (lycopene gene) biobrick K274100 submitted by team Cambridge 2009, for which two new biobricks was constructed. Addtionally, I contributed to the bioreporters partly, such as bioreporters for mercury or lead.

I did the transformation, double digestion and PCR twice but the result was the same. The idea for producing VioABCE, VioABDE and VioABCDE by myself was given up because of the time limition.
7.23-8.17
I began to do the characterization for CrtEBI(K274100) and CrtEBIY(K274200).
CrtEBI(K274100) and CrtEBIY(K274200) were ligated to constitutive promoter (BBa_J23103) and terminator (B0015). All the protocols followed protocols above. Unfortunately, I failed in ligating the CrtEBIY and terminator (B0015) though I did this experiment many times in different conditions. The conditions included
1. ligase with different companies(NEB and Trans)
2. different ligation time(1, 2, 4, 12 hours)
3. different reaction systems
(1)
XP CrtEBIY(insert)             2μl    1μl   4μl
SP terminator(vector)            6μl    7μl   4μl
10×T4 buffer   1μl
T4 DNA Ligase   1μl
Total    10μl
(2)
XP CrtEBIY(insert)             4μl    2μl   8μl
SP terminator(vector)           12μl   14μl   8μl
10×T4 buffer   2μl
T4 DNA Ligase   2μl
Total    20μl
4. different temperatures(16℃ and 25℃).
The results were on our wiki, so I didn’t repeat here.

8.18-8.25
After the characterization of CrtEBI(K274100) and CrtEBIY(K274200), we chose CrtEBI as our reporter. So I began to ligate the reporter to the promoter.
1. Double digest for CrtEBI and PmerT(on pSB1C3, submitted by Yiwei Chen)
NEB:
CrtEBI                  10μl
10×3 buffer            2μl
XbaI                    1μl
PstI                     1μl
ddH2O                    6μl
Total                    20μl
PmerT                  10μl
10×2 buffer            2μl
SpeI                    1μl
PstI                     1μl
ddH2O                   6μl
Total                    20μl
37℃ overnight
2. Ligate
XP CrtEBI(insert)             2μl    1μl   4μl
SP PmerT (vector)            6μl    7μl   4μl
10×T4 buffer   1μl
T4 DNA Ligase   1μl
Total    10μl
16℃ overnight(NEB)
Or
25℃ 2 hours(Trans)
3. Transform and pick five single colonies and inoculate (in 5ml antibiotics culture), miniprep, digest and sequence.
This process was repeated many times in different ligation conditions, but all failed.
8.26-9.10
I used another strategy. Two strands of the promoter PmerT and PpbrA which were synthesized by Hua Da company was used. The two strands included EcoRI and SpeI site. The promoters were inserted to the vector which has CrtEBI.
1. Anneal
Mer_pro_for   1.5μl
Mer_pro_rev   1.5μl
PpbrA_for   1.5μl
PpbrA_rev   1.5μl
Metalbath 95℃ 5min
Cool to room temperature(on metalbath)
2. Phosphorylation
Insert    3μl
T4-Ligase buffer(NEB)    1μl
T4 polykinase(NEB)      1μl
ddH2O                 4μl
total                   9μl
37℃  30min
3. Ligation
Insert(after phosphorylation)   9μl
T4-ligase                  1μl
Vector                    1μl
Total                     11μl
16℃  1hour
Or
16℃  overnight
4. Transform, pick colonies, miniprep, digest and sequence.
After repeated several times, I succeed in PpbrA-CrtEBI at last. Then I ligated the CrtEBI to PmerT in pSB1C3 again and succeed. But the worst was still to come. The E.coli which has PpbrA-CrtEBI or PmerT- CrtEBI appeared bright red, just as the constitutive promoter-CrtEBI. So we had to give up CrtEBI as our repoter.
September & October
9.1-9.10
9.10-10.10
The summer vocation has come to a close. I retarded the progress. All the protocols followed protocols above.
1. Three colones
Pmert-pag
PmerT-ogr
PmerT-phiR73delta
Everything went off without a hitch.
2. Change backbones
constitutive promoter(BBa_J23103)-CrtEBI
terminator (B0015) )-CrtEBI
constitutive promoter(BBa_J23103)-CrtEBIY
The double digestion (EcoRI and PstI) for constitutive promoter(BBa_J23103)-CrtEBIY failed twice. The double digestion (EcoRI and PstI) result was the same as the EcoRI digestion or PstI digestion. The terminator (B0015) )-CrtEBI transformed twice after changing the backbone, but the results of sequence were all wrong.
