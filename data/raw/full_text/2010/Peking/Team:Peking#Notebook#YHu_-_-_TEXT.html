   Yang Hu's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
For the bench work, I was responsible for the construction of mercury metal binding peptide cytosol expression module and T7 promoter drove MerR generation module. I also helped to conduct western blotting assay.On the other hand, I take charge of the work of Human Practice concerning about the potential problems of horizontal gene transfer.
