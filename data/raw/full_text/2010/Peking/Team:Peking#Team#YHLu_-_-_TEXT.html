Statement It is a great experience to participate in 2010 iGEM for it provides me with opportunities to solve problems with people of various backgrounds and learn different ways of thinking. Personally, I have always been interested in describing biological process with basic physical principles, and I will try my best to realize such a goal in the modeling work of this year.
