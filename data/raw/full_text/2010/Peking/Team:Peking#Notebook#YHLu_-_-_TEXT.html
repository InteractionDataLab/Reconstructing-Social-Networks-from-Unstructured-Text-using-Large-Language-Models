   Yuheng Lu's Notes
                                                                                                                                                
During the summer I mainly worked with Yin Zhenzhen, building ODE models and writing codes to search for gene circuits with linear correlationship between input and output. We also tried to explan the responses of MerR promoter to changes in Hg(II) concentration. Besides, we also constructed the first version of our Wiki.
