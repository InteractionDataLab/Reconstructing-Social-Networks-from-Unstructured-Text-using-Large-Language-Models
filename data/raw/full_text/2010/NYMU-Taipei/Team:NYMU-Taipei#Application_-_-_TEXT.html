About Us
Your promoter and Your protein
Project overview by figure.
In the overview figure of our project, you can see your promoter and your protein. Because the main purpose of our project is to provide a speedy and useful tool for everyone who is doing synthetic biology research, we designed a flexible system which can be applied for different needs. The explanation of your promoter and your protein is as below:
Your promoter
Here you can change "your promoter" with your own promoter which you are interested in. This part can be used to measure the quantity and locations of mRNA induced by different types or different strength promoters. With this novel method, we can get faster and more understanding the relationship between promoters and mRNA transcription.
Your protein
Here you can also change to the use of your own protein and by fusion with our specific peptide adaptor. Then you can use the novel speedy protein reporter in our SpeedyBac system to know the localization of different proteins and the influence of translation under different situations.
Applications
Our project has several benefits and have several applications as follows:
Our SpeedyBac can be used to measure the gene expression in single cells. It helps us to avoid some potential pitfalls resulted in bulk assays (Muzzey and van Oudenaarden, 2009).
Users can exchange our promoter and protein for their own easily and measure them much faster than traditional methods.
With our Speedy switch, we can halt the gene expression at transcription level, so we can study the roles of mRNA in gene expression more easily.
Compared to the conventional methods for measuring gene expression, our SpeedyBac provide a faster and more flexible way in studying the gene expression and interactions between different biological parts in vivo.
