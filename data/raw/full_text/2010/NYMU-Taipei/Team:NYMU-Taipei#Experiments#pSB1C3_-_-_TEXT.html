Autoclaved 500ml of LB-Agar (1.2%) and left it in the 56oC incubator overnight
2010-09-05
Added chloramphenicol resistance @50mg/ml to the LB-agar and made two stacks of Chr-resistance plates (1:00-1:30pm).
Transformed BBa_J04450 on a pSB1C3 plasmid (2009 kit 1 well 5A) onto a Chr-resistant plate (4:15-5:00pm -- waited extra long at the ice step).
15uL ddddH20 to get the plasmid out from the biobrick plate.
used 2uL of plasmid in 20uL DH5α competent cell for transformation.
also transformed 2uL of E0240 (on pSB1A2 (amp resistance)) on a chr-resistant plate as a negative control.

Plate to 4oC
3-in-1 of the BBa_J04450 plate.

Plasmid extraction of BBa_J04450 then digested with (XP)
Gel extraction of the pSB1C3 plasmid.
