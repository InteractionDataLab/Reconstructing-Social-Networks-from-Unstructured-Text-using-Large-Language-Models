About Us
Autoclaved an empty 250ml bottle and a jar of 2ml eppendorfs.
They were then dried in the 56C incubator then left to cool down to room temperature.
Added dddH2O into the bottle and autoclaved again to form ddddH2O.
The ddddH2O was then passed through another filter to form dddddH2O and aloquited into the 2ml eppendorfs.
Stored in a clean bag at -80C.
When needed to be used, the bag is opened only in the laminar flow.
Theoretically, it's no cleaner than dddH2O though XD.
