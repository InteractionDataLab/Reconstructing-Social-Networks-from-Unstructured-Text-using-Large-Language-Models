Formal Meeting - 1st July 2010
Agenda
Roll call
Everyone here except Phil and Younus who are in the lab. Arrived 10 mins later.
Action points from last week
Wiki changes have been made.
Letter to Andrew Young is not finished - someone needs to be in charge of this.
Civil engineer funding is not done yet.
Flights: plan is to get there on Thursday about 4-5 p.m.
Research feedback - end of crack signalling, quorum sensing
Oxygen limitation triggers subtilin production, ResD and E.
Need subtilin immunity brick too spaIFEG.
Subtilin receptor was done in 2008 by Newcastle spaRK.
Want it to be triggered by both oxygen limitation and by subtilin. Oxygen to trigger the production at the end of the crack, subtilin to propagate the signal.
We need to get the strain with these genes. ATCC6633.
Lab feedback
Arginine and urease tests - Harsh and Alan. The experiment has been designed, waiting for the materials. In the lab at 4 pm.
Urea media, grown overnight, If the urea is used, there will be a colour change.
Arginine test. Bug in LB, supplement with arginine. If arginine is used, pH increase.
Phil and Younus, transforming E. coli dh5alpha with the vector that we will be using for lacI. Plasmid extraction tomorrow.
Logo and T-shirts
Finalised.
University logo must be correct - take it from the University website, not from anywhere else. Fill in the form to get the high resolution image.
CBCB logo needs to be added. Ask Jeff or Joanna.
Visas
Younus still hasn't filled in the visa-waiver form.
Funding
Andrew Young letter needs to be finished and checked tomorrow.
Timeline
Could be made more detailed now.
Might need another brick, for motility or swarming. Definitely do not want biofilm formation.
Spider silk next? It's on our logo so we should do it.
Action points
Phil: talk to Dr Aldridge about glue. How easy would it be to design a glue BioBrick?
All: Andrew Young letter needs to be finished and checked tomorrow.
Next meeting
Next Wednesday, 3 p.m.
Chair: Harsh, Minutes: Alan, Computer: Phil
