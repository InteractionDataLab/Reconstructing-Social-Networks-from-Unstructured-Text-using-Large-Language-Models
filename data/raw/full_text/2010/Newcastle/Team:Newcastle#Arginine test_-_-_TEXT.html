Arginine Test
Materials Required
Plate containing Bacillus subtilis 168 colonies.
Flame (streaking) loop
LB media consisting of  arginine
Auto pipette
Bursen Burner
Universal Tube
pH indicator paper
Procedures
Perform the experiment using aseptic technique.
Transfer B. subtilis 168 colonies into universal tubes containing 5 ml of LB media and allowed to grow overnight at 37° C.
Transfer 1 ml of the overnight culture to another universal tube containing 4 ml of the following media:
Control (1) - LB media
Control (2) - LB media with 10 mM of arginine
Control (3) - LB media plus B. subtilis 168
Test (1) - LB media with 10 mM of arginine plus B. subtilis 168
Test (2) - LB media with 10 mM of arginine plus B. subtilis 168
Incubate the culture at 37° C with shaking.
Record the pH at every 30 min interval.Use 20 ul of the culture and measure the pH using the pH indicator paper.
