Informal Meeting - 4 June 2010
Agenda
Urease tutorial - recap
Accessory genes and nickel incorporation necessary more complicated than we thought.
Software engineering cycle
Requirements -> specification-> design-> implementation -> testing -> maintenance ...link back to the requirements
Specification more detail on the requirements- literature
Urease calcium carbonate, optimise for Bacillis
Increase expression- what we thought!
Biosynthesis of active BS in the Absence of Known Urease Accessory Proteins: paper
Accessory genes required!
Look over papers from tutorial
Sporosarcina pasteurii
Biobrick site symbols
Promoter-ribosome- binding- coding sequence –ribosome binding site-coding-ribosome binding coding- terminator sequences ...and spacers
pSpac
ncbi – find the genome – can see the genes
Implementation using sequencher
Find the sequence of part
Assemble parts
Biobrick friendly restriction sites
Genbank/embl file format
Implementation altered by cloning strategy
Biobricks RFC- request for comments
duplo and lego don’t fit together
Video for lego pipette
LAB TRAINING GROUPS:
Group 1 starts 14th June: SW, D.Y AK, (HS); working on Biobrick 2 & 5 (End of crack & signalling system; Glue & lysis)
Group 2 starts 21st June: JS, RB, RC, PH, (YE); working on BioBrick 3 & 4 (Non-target-environment kill switch; Spider silk and filamentous cells)
All team members working on BioBrick 1 (CaCO3/Urease).
RC working on BioBrick 6 (sequential programming)
Team members not in the lab training will be working on modeling.
HS and YE will unfortunately be away for both lab training sessions, hence the brackets
