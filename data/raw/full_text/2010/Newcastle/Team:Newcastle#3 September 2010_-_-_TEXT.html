Levan glue
We started working on levan. For this we used agar plates containing 10% sucrose and Bacillus subtilis 168 was grown onto that medium. The sucrose cultures and controls were compared. The cultures grown on sucrose should be considerably thicker.
The overnight cultures of the different strains were also grown on solid agar plates with and without sucrose. For more information levan, please refer to: levan .
