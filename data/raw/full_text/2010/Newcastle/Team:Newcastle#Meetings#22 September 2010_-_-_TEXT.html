Lab feedback
There should be red colonies on E. coli plates.
pSpac and Hyperspank is expected to fully express in E. coli.
Arabinose stands a better chance at winning.
Arabinose repressor in pSB1AK3. Has to go into B. subtilis 168.
iGEM letter plates - gaps left in the sucrose agar filled with cells producing glue and the sand is sticking to the glue, showing the letters. If the plates are turned over, the sand still remains attached.
Concrete
Cement has been mixed, set in tubes, still at 37°C for a day.
Make dilute solution containing cells and dip the end of the concrete (dry) in it and let it dry out and send it to EM lab.
We went to the EM facility, won't be a problem to take photos of our concrete.
