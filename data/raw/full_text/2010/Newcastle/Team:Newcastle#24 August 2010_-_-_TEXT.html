Miniprep for pGFPrrnB with filamentous cell part
Aims
The aim of this experiment is to obtain stock of the filamentous cell part in pGFP-rrnB for transformation into Bacillus subtilis 168.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to qiagen minipreps and nanodrop spectrophotometer protocols.

Discussion
The concentration ranged from 286.1 µl/ml to 518.7 µl/ml. Therefore we have obtained high concentration of yneA in pGFPrrnB.
Double Digestion of pGFPrrnB with filamentous cell part
Aims
The aim of this experiment is screen our minipreps to check if the insert is present.
Materials and Protocol
We are doing two digests for pGFPrrnB and yneA:
Single digest with HindIII;
Double digest with EcoRI and NheI.
Please refer to restriction digests and gel electrophoresis .
Results
Figure 1: Gel electrophoresis result for restriction digest of pGFPrrnB and yneA with Nhe1 and Spe1.

Conclusion
The results show that the insert is present, as there is a band at approximately 541bp corresponding to yneA and a band at approximately 8.4kbp corresponding to pGFPrrnb in lanes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12.
