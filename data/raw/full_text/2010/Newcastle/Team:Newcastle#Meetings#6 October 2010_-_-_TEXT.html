Agenda
Presentation
Introduction
Mention why do we use this bug and that it is able to live in high pH
Have to menetion that we all biobrick have been modelled by SBML and copasi
Bacilla Filla slide
The solution words to be smaller than the logo
Logo have to be the biggest!
Solution at the top of the page with a small logo below it then zoom into the logo
Technical review slide
Show the link between the genes
Some of the summary slide's information to go here, example: swim down the cracks, the tent, spray on, etc.
A single shot overview then to the biobricks
Say: This is a crack, and here is our bug on the surface of the crack, etc
Label the pictures!
Animation for the overview, ie, the background to remain the same
Swarming slide
Change the flagella of the bug
Zoom into the plates
Subtilin slide
Show subtilin only when the bug is at the end of the crack
Fill up the crack with bugs
Describle the subtilin signalling system
Change the pveg promoter to the oxygen sensitive promoter
Subtilin immunity slide
SAY: Subtilin immunity already in the registry, that is why we use it
Mention what the individual CDS do
Green tick for those that we did and a red cross for those that we did not
Workflow slide
Change the word interesting to valuable to all synthetic biologist
Cut down on the script
Have to make it fit to the presentation
Integration of lots of data that is why we use e-science
YneA slide
Put filamentous cells into the pictures
Metabolic pathway picture and link it
Glue slide
The iGEM plates to go onto it
Kill switch
Can bin it
Move to the ethic page
Ethic slide
Move it to the front after the introduction and also mention in the summary
What is the danger and how we make it safe
Others
Show that the bug is able to grow in concrete
Urease slide
Have to show that calcium carbonate is filling up the cracks
Have to say that we are better than the rest
Highlight the advantage of ours and the disadvantage of others
Mention SR1
Lab feedback
Filamentous cells
Redo the microscopic
Correlate between the expression of GFP and the length
SR1
We have colonies
Scanning electron microscopy
The concrete samples are already with the EM unit
Agenda
To re-edit the agenda
Action points
Rachel and Phil: Characterisation data for filamentous cells brick needs to be put on the wiki and the parts registry.
Everyone to do up the presentation slides first.
Next meeting
13th, Wed October, 4 p.m.
Chair: Steven, Computer: Alan, Minutes: Deena
