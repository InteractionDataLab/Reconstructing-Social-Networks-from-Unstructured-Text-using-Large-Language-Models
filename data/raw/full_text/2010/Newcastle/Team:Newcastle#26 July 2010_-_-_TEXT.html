Preparation for cloning of the rocF BioBrick
Aim
In preparation for Gibson cloning of the rocF BioBrick we started work on mini preps of plasmid DNA, and on B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA extraction.
Re-hydration of registry parts
Re-hydration of dried parts registry DNA
We re-hydrated using sterile distill water:
pSB1C3 (the plasmid we will be submitting our BioBricks to the registry in) and
pSB1AK3 with BBa_B0014 (the double terminator we will be using for the rocF BioBrick) from the parts distribution.
Transformation of E. coli
We transformed and plated separate tubes of E. coli DH5α with:
The above two re-hydrated plasmids
BBa_K143062 , a LacI BioBrick sent to us by Imperial College, London, UK which we will use to help characterise many of our BioBricks, including rocF.
A positive control which we had already prepared during our training week - pSB1AT3 with rfp insert.
A negative control (no vector), to verify the antibiotic plates are working (no growth should be observed on this plate).
Please refer to the transformation protocol for E. coli DH5α here: Transformation of E. coli .
Overnight cultures of B. subtilis 168 for chromosomal DNA extraction
The rocF coding sequence is to be amplified from the B. subtilis 168 genome by PCR. Before we can do this we need to extract 168 chromosomal DNA.
Today we plated up overnight cultures of B. subtilis 168 so that we can do chromosome extraction tomorrow.
PCR of Genomic DNA
Aim:
To determine whether the genomic DNA has been extracted from B. subtilis strains 168 and 3610.
Materials:
Pipette
Microfuge
Microtubes
Distilled H2O
Nucleotide DNTP
5x GoTaq buffer
Template DNA
Forward and reverse primers
Protocol:
For the full protocol, please refer to PCR .
Conditions in ThermoCycler:
Melting temperature, Tm used for anneal step is 59°C.
Results:
Gel electrophoresis will be undertaken tomorrow to determine the results.
Conclusion:
Please refer to Lab book dated 27th July 2010 .
