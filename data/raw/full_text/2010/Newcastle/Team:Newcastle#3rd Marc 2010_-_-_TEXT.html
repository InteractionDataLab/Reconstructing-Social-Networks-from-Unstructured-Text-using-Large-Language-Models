Agenda
Shortlisting
The teams had presented three presentations of the three "best" ideas. Neil, Jen and <advisor> had made many suggestions and brainstormed all of the ideas, thinking about possible outcome, subprojects, etc. It has been concluded that all projects were feasible and good.
It has been decided (based on Jen's suggestion) that the diabetes part of the Bacco Natto project is to be dropped.
The team had chosen the Concrete repair project based on the voting of team members (which included the votes of Phil and Rachel, who were absent)
Votes: Phil: Bacto Natto, Rachel: Bacto Natto, Jannetta: Bacto Natto, Harsh: Concrete, Younus: Concrete, Steve: Concrete, Zoltan: Concrete, Alan: Concrete, Da: Concrete. Richard: Does not mind, his project idea can be a side project in all of the other projects.
