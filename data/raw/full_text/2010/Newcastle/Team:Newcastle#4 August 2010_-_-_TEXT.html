Cloning the rocF BioBrick
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to amplify 6 different RocF fragments for the construction of rocF BioBrick using Phusion PCR.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to PCR for Phusion PCR protocol. The details for the 6 PCR reactions are mentioned below:

Table 1: Table represents 6 different Phusion PCR reactions and the parts which are amplified so that they can be ligated together with the help of Gibson Cloning method.
The extension rate of the Phusion polymerase is at 1Kb/ 30 seconds. Therefore the extension time of each PCR reaction is different.
To learn more about the rocF fragments, please refer to the Cloning strategy for rocF .
Discussion
The 6 Phusion PCR reactions were carried out.
Conclusion
Gel electrophoresis will be carried out tomorrow - 5th August, 2010 to confirm that the RocF fragments have been successfully amplified.
