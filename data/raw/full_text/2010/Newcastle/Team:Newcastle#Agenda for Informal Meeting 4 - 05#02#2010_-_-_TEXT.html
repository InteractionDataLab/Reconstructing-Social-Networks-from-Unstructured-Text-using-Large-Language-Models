Summary of the last formal meeting
By the 17th of Feb we aim to begin shortlisting ideas
By the 27th of Feb we aim to have decided on a project idea, and then have a week to make sure our chosen project is feasible and novel
By the 3rd of March we aim to have finalised our project decision and to have decided on a project title
We need to have a timeline ready by Web 10th of Feb
There will be a computational modelling tutorial on Web 10th of Feb; biobricks and Clone Manager/Sequenter tutorials will follow
We need to think about which glass award we would like to aim for
Ideas
Jannetta: There is a type of bacteria which binds to beans, and produces nitrogen from air. This means the plant does not have to get its nitrogen from the soil. The bacteria are not optimal: we could develop improved bacteria, and prevent the old bacteria from binding
Da: Diabetes treatment. Produce an insulin replacement. The quantity of bacteria used will need to be regulated, determined from the patient's conditions. What about immune system response?
Steven: Error detection on DNA, to prevent biotechnology from mutating (an error would trigger a kill switch). I'll write this up somewhere on the wiki later.
dotProject
A project management tool
Allows you to set up tasks, with a start time and an end time
Allows you to set up important milestones, like actually going to Boston in November
Using the Human Resources features you can assign people to a task, who will be informed by email
You can update a task to give an estimate of how far from completion it is
Tasks can be dependent on each other - one task may not be able to begin until another is completed
You can view a Gantt chart, which shows the tasks, how far from completion they are, and their dependencies
Using the Gantt chart you can see the effects of tasks overrunning
Trouble tickets - list of problems that need fixing, allocated to certain people
Has forums for discussions, which we may or may not find useful
Has a calendar
We will probably make the meeting chair responsible for setting up new tasks
There is documentation on the dotProject website
Don't use the browser's forward and back buttons!
Action points
We are meeting early on Wed 10th to discuss and finalise the time line. Meet at 3.30
Data mining of previous projects needs to be completed by Friday 12th Feb
Everyone should add their contact details and personal deadlines to their personal wiki page
Everyone try using dotProject
Everyone check the timeline as Philip is working on it, it should be finished by Wed
More ideas, work on existing ideas
