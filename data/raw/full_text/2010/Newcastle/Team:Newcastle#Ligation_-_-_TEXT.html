For sticky end ligation, incubate the tube containing above mentioned chemicals on the bench for a period of 3-4 hours or overnight.
Important point to note is that 1:3 dilution means that during ligation, for 1 unit of vector, there are 3 units of insert and in 1:5 ligation, for 1 unit of vector there is 5 units of insert.
Notes
For standard ligation, 100-200 ng of vector DNA is required and this can be checked using nanodrop protocol (refer to Nanodrop Spectrophotometer protocol).
Ligation calculation can be used to calculate the amount of vector and insert required for the ligation but 1:3 or 1:5 ligation ratios are used more frequently.
