Urease Test
Aims
The aim of this experiment was to determine if Bacillus subtilis 168 is able to produce urease and degrade urea.
Procedures
Please refer to urease test
Inference
Christensen's Urea Agar was formulated to detect and differentiate urolytic and urea degrading microorganisms. The addition of gelatine peptone, dextrose and reduced content of buffer supports a luxuriant growth at an early stage. Urea is the substrate and can be degraded by certain organisms, which results in ammonia building. The ammonia makes the media alkaline and therefore the indicator phenol red will change from orange color to pink-red color.
Negative control - No color change (Orange color)
Test 1 (Duplicate) - Pink-red color
Test 2 (Duplicate) - Pink-red color
For actual results, please see 02.07.10 lab notebook.
Competent E. coli Production
Aims
To make a stock of competent E. coli (DH5α strain) ready for transformation.
Materials and Protocol
Set up liquid culture consisting of E. coli DH5α.
