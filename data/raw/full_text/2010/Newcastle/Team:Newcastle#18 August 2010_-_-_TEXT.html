Discussion
The concentration of the different tubes range from 140.0 µl/ml to 456.6 µl/ml. The standard value for miniprep extraction is ~150 µg/ml.
Conclusion
High DNA concentration was obtained.

Double digest of filamentous cell part, pSB1C3 and pGFP-rrnB
We performed double digests of the filamentous cell part and pSB1C3 using EcoRI and SpeI, ready for ligation.
We also performed double digests of the filamentous cell part and pGFP-rrnB  using EcoRI and NheI, ready for ligation.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to Restriction digests .
