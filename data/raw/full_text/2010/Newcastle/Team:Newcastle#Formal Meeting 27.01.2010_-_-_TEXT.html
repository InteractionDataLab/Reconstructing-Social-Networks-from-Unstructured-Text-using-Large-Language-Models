Ideas Brainstorm
Phil
Arsenic sequestering or heavy metal
Detect using fluorescence
Last year did it/Cambridge
Pigments... can we improve?
Zoltan
Degrading hydrocarbons
B. subtillis can do this already can we improve it
Problem biofilms, we must stop the bacteria forming a biofilm
Oil slicks
Bacteria already do it, not as fit.
Ethics
Environment not contained
Damaging to wild life, counterproductive to cleaning up the oil slick
Steven
Removal of CO2
Making biotechnology safer
Kill switches
Reducing rates of mutation
Harsh
CO2 to isobutynol
Cut cyclic chain, fuel instead of fat
Spores not germinate
Weaponised hydrocarbon spores
Need clean burn
Alan

Enhance
Better promoter
Nitrogenase genes
Anaerobic
2009 heavy metal sequestering plus fertiliser
Plant root, protect (fungicide), fertilise
