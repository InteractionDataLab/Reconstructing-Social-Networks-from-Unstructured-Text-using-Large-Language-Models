PCR Purification
Materials
1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes
2 ml collection tube
QIAquick columns
Qiagen Buffer PB
Qiagen Buffer EB
Qiagen Buffer PE
DNA mixture from PCR
Protocol
Add 5 volumes of Qiagen Buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR product.
Put a QIAquick spin column into a 2ml collection tube.
Apply the mixture to the QIAquick column to bind the DNA and centrifuge for 30 to 60 seconds at 13,000 rpm.
Discard flow-through. Add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to the spin column to wash and centrifuge for 30 to 60 seconds at 13,000 rpm.
Discard flow-through and centrifuge for another 1 minute at 13,000 rpm.
Place QIAquick spin column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50 µl Buffer EB to the center of the membrane of spin column and centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm.
If analysing purified DNA using gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of DNA.
Store the PCR product either at 4°C or at -20°C.
