Gelatine peptone 1.0 g
Potassium dihydrogen phosphate 2.0 g
Sodium chloride 5.0 g
Agar 20 g
Top up to 1 liter and apply gentle heating to dissolve. Sterilize at 115°C for at least 20 min.

Pick up single colony of B. subtilis 168 and streaking it onto the slanted agar tube.
Loosen up the cap to allow air exchange between the interior of the tube and the external environment.
Incubate the tubes overnight at 37°C.
Set up the tubes as indicated:
Negative control - Without B. subtilis 168
