Characterisation of filamentous cell part
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to transform our filamentous Bacillus subtilis 168 strain with the integration vector pMutin4, in order to put the part under LacI repression. We will then be able to characterise its behaviour by inducing at different levels of IPTG.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to: Transformation of Bacillus subtilis .
