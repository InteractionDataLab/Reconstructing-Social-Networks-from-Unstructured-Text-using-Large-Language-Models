Agenda
Roll call
Everyone present except Da, Prof. Colin Harwood, Dr Colin Davie and Dr Wendy Smith
Research feedback
Levan glue - Levan requires sucrose to work
Test how much sucrose is needed - Phil
Kill switch - Use of mazE and mazF
How much sucrose is needed for it to work?
How fast does the bug use up all the sucrose?
Stochastic switch - Use of hinC as the invertase
Matt to work with Phil to work out the probability of the switching
Have to work out what is wrong with the iGEM 2009 stochastic switch first
Gibson protocol
rocF to require 6 pair of primers, therefore try doing up 2 fragments first
Protocol for yneA
Do up the characterization separately, one bacteria to contain yneA to show filamentous, the other to have the lacI
Could have nice photo with the different morphology on agar
Do not shine UV light on during the gel extraction step to avoid DNA mutation
Make up lots of DNA to allow better transformation
Lab feedback
Arginine test - Alan and Harsh
Test worked fine.
Could refine the test by using universal liquid pH indicator or to use the pH meter
DNA extraction - Harsh and Racheal
Could only confirm the result on 27.07.2010
Wiki
Not able to do the drop down menu with the shadow test, therefore could try using htm5
Horizontal strip to change to purple
