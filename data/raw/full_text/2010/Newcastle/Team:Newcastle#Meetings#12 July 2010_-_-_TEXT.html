Cloning Strategies
5 parts to a Cloning Strategy:
The cloning strategies for each biobrick should contain the following sections in this order:
Purpose and Justification
Modelling
Construction
Cloning and Integration
Testing and Characterising
Required Cloning Strategies
There are 8 cloning strategies which are required:
SR1 - finished!
YneA - biobrick nearly coming back - our most important biobrick!
LacI - not sure how to test this biobrick
2 for Swarming (sfp and swrA) - cloning strategies nearly finished
2 for Subtilin (immunity and production) - cloning strategies nearly finished
RocF (need to use Gibson method) - not started
So only the cloning strategy for SR1 is finished. 7 more to go!
Allocation of team members to cloning strategies:
YneA - Phil, Rach, Deena, Younus
LacI - Phil, Younus, Rachel
Swarming (2) - Harsh, Alan, Steve, Da
Subtilin (2) - Harsh, Alan, Steve, Deena
RocF - Harsh, Alan, Steve, Da
Wiki - Labbook
Everyone needs to carry out the following protocol for each day in the lab
Aim
Materials and Methods
Procedure/Protocol
Results
Conclusion
Relevant photographs should be added and labelled
General:
Wiki checkers: Deena and Rachel (after altering/updating a page on the wiki, team members should send the links to the pages to the wiki checkers)
