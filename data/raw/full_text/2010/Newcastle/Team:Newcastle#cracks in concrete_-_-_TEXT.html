Reasons Cracks are bad!
Allows water to reach and corrode steel reinforcements
Weakens concrete structures
Difficult to repair
Work in this area has already been started: Bio-concrete
This project is different to ours in that it cannot repair existing structures and bacillus subtilis cells only remain viable in the bio-concrete for a short period of time. This is not a concern for our project as we don't want the cells to survive for long periods of time, just long enough to fix the crack!
How our project helps
Reduces corrosion rate of the steel reinforcements
Reduces the need to demolish and rebuild concrete structures
Reduces cement production
How our project is novel
Filamentous cells- like steel fibers
Getting the Bacteria to produce the gel/glue that holds it all together.
Environmental kill switch
We are working with a well known strain Bacillus subtilis 168 (previous work required specific stains)
