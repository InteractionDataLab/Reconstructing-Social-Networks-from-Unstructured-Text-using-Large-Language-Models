Aims
The aim of today's Lab practice was to extract the plasmids for GFP and RFP, digest the 2 plasmids and extract the 2 inserts and 1 of the backbones (vector)from an agarose gel. From this a ligation was set up.

We cut the inserts which were about 900bp and we use the backbone from the plasmid consisting rfp.
