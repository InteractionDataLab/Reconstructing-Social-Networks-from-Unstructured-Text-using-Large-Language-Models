Hyperspankoid characterisation
Aims
The aim of these experiments is to ligate the promoters hyperspankoid, pspacoid and hyperspank in front of rfp on  the pSB1C3 plasmid seperately. In order to do this, the first step is to amplify the three promoter sequences and the pSB1C3 plasmid using Phusion PCR.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to Phusion PCR for Phusion PCR protocol.
The details of the four PCR reactions are included in the table below:
