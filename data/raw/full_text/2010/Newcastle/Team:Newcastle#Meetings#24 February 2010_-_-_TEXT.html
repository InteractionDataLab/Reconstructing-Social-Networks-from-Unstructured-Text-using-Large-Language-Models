Updates
iGEM 2010 Team Newcastle Registered
Final Date for Jamboree 5-8th Nov?
Shortlist so far
Project ideas – team members assigned to look into this projects   TOP FIVE
[1] Computing DNA - Rachel, Zoltan, Steven
[2] Microcracks in Concrete - Harsh, Da, Alan
[3] BactoNatto, Teeth, Coating spores/BS - Rachel, Younus, Jannetta
[4] Headlice - Richard, Janetta,Phil
[5] Linearising DNA - Richard, Phil, Zoltan
Possible other projects
[A] Diabetes - Da, Younus and Harsh
[B] French Flag - Steven and Zoltan
[C] Putting BS into us?/BS against disease or diseased water? - Richard
Sub-project
[D] MAZef kill switch
Decision of project
Ideal situation: All decide on one project on Friday – Present idea on Wed
Likely situation: Choose top 3 projects – Present on Wed 3rd - formal meeting
If can’t decide on which project – put it to the vote (like last year!)
Presentations
About 5 minutes, 3-4 slides.
Work in assigned groups of three
demonstrate project is viable/explain how it works + problems/issues
Start looking at a lower level i.e. which genes involved
Start looking at modelling languages, SPML, environments?
Use Google Scholar
Major Weakness of many previous iGEM teams – Modelling is tagged onto Lab work. We should perform modelling-informed lab work
Timeline
For the Summary table for AW & JH:
Different Individuals holidays should by included
For personal and practical issues
To get a picture of when everyone is available
List of all tasks with hard deadlines highlighted
T-Shirts/Poster – not a single point
Misc?
Team Roster – Finalise who is coming to the Jamboree – twice?
Action Points
All members to apply for membership for iGEM 2010 Team Newcastle
AW & JW to e-mail Jannetta and Phil about Timeline summary
Visas/Passports – Check whether visas required/If passports in date.
Zoltan and Harsh –
British Passport -> don’t need visa but need to fill in online form
JH, AW and M… already have visas from last years
Complete Data mining
Purchase/try Natto!!!!!
Other businesses
Harsh’s cheaper/quicker flight to Boston option - Booking has to go through University still. Would be helpful to identify flights
Ideas
[1] Computing DNA
Kill switch
Modifying bacteria so that as they evolve they move closer or further away from answering a problem
Bacteria survive if close to answer [1?], die if further away from answer [0?]
Hamiltonian Pathway
[2] Microcracks in Concrete
Spray bacteria into concrete
spray nutrients, when nutrients run out – forms a polymer/biofilm
fills cracks by producing e.g. polymer, protein, CaCO3 etc.
Difficulty – way of detecting cracks - X-rays
Great wall of China – used rice – still there!
Worlds strongest Glue – Camylobacter cresentus
Spider silk – contracts as it dries – could be like reinforced concrete
Spores germinate when cracks get bigger – start to grow again!
Applications: Cracks in space shuttles, shoes
Advantage over normal glue? BS can get to cracks, where normal glue cannot!
Well-known problem – microcracks will develop into bigger cracks
Chemical engineer would be required
[3] BactoNatto, Teeth, Coating spores/BS
S. mutans binding to ... in teeth -> decay teeth
displace this organism with BS
90 day protection?
Spoon of this - mix into anything?
MIT 2007 -> didnt manage to transform lactobacillus with specific plasmid
Would have to use a computer stimulation of teeth
Chocolate/vanilla/banana flavoured Natto!
Miracal cure
with Fluorides, Omega, Vitamins [D], Minerals etc.
[4] Headlice
Male stomach discs?
Female symbiotic relationship with bacteria
How to introduce BS?
Lice v hard to get rid of
Bacillus Stringensis?
[5] Linearising DNA
bacteria with linear chromosomes/plasmids - Agrobacteria?
Streptomyces ... also has linear DNA
problem of replication - as it is normally bidirectional
Richard's two papers
Flipase/RecA?
[B] French Flag
spatial and temporal organisation-self organisation
bacteria grow in a certain pattern without external stimuli - they decide on the basis of local stimuli
