Formal Meeting - 21st October 2010
Apologies - Phil, Younus, Deena (late)
Agenda
yneA Characteristaion:
ΔamyE:Pspac(hy)-oid::yneA
B. subtilis spread of IPTG may not be homogenous through the population.
E. coli has transporter deltions: check E. coli wiki
take out pMap65 results
Median, Mode add to graph
pMutin4 proportion of cells
20% responding- looks like
Biomass of cells - length * amount (counts)) against IPTG
Lysis acts to counter the overexpression of yneA ... so we have fewer cells
Younus AP: send script for yneA to Jen, Matt, Neil
Plot: Max cell length against ITPG + Error bars
Arabinose
We think we have it cloned infront of GFP
B. subtilis transformation tommorrow
Fluorescence
Characterisation of previous part!!!
Concrete
Damaged building - earthquake
Flux balance
difference between optimal and normal
Lab work
DNA submitted - tracking number sent
1C3 SR1 has not arrived, we would have had 2 bricks submitted!
Safety page
Deena and Harsh
Risk assessment - Bacillus
BioCOSH
Safety Guy talk mention it
Presentation
Phil - DON'T BE AGGRESSIVE!!!!
Beginning:
say what the project is about
mention Bacillus subtilis
Why bacillus?
bioconcrete- show its current
Non-pathogenic not non-virulent
BioBricks:
Previous work on CaCO3
Don't use the word PROVES
Alan - Flux first, speak slowly
Gold:
Jannetta write RFC
number on judging form
webservice!!!
Separate slid for work flows
SEM:
Images are ours
Summary table
redo with BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD section?!
Action points:
Check presentation and poster submission. Poster next Thursday due in?
Phil and Rachel to add characteristation data to the wiki
Other
Insurance form
