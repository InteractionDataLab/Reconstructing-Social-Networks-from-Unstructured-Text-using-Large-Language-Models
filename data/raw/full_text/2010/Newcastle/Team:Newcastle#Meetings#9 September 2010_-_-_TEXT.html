Formal Meeting - 9th September 2010
Agenda
Roll calls
Apologies: Phil and Deena
Absence: Colin Harwood and Colin Davie
Modelling
Metabolic Flux Balance Analysis - Show the judges what happen when we alter the enzyme levels to produce different outcomes.
Lab feedback
Gibson cloning - Joining of 2 fragments together works, but could not be ligated into the vector. Need more time to perfect the technique.
Subtilin immunity - Same as rocF
yneA - Transforming into Bacillus subtilis 168 strains works and we have filamentous cells. However still not able to integrate yneA into Pmutin strains. Could use a plasmid that have already contain the IPTG system. For characterization, we could either do a titration with IPTG together with time lapse microscopy to measure the length of the cells.
Arabinose promoter - Insert the promoter in front of GFP and characterize with the addition of arabinose.
Levan glue - Able to stick sand together. Mix the glue with sand and filamentous cells and look under the microscope. Also to mix the glue with sand to produce the iGEM logo.
Concrete
Use different bacteria to seal up the cracks.
Preincubate the concrete in media.
Wiki
Lab book is up to date.
Visas
ESTA must be completed (if required) ASAP.
T-shirt
Upload the t-shirt files into the dropbox.
Action points
Neil and Jen - To register the team.
Alan - To email Jen about the IPTG plasmid and the letters for the sucrose plates.
Harsh - To crack the concrete into smaller pieces.
Wendy - To talk to the EM people.
Next meeting
Wednesday, 15th September, 9am; CBCB.
Chair: Jannetta, Minutes: Steven, Computer: Alan
