E. coli DH5α (200 µl)
Appropriate vector DNA
Heat block
Bucket of ice
Pipettes
Eppendorf tubes

Thaw a 200 µl aliquot of E. coli DH4α and add the transforming DNA (10 ng of vector DNA in 10 µl).
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat-shock the cells for 120 seconds at 42°C, and place on ice again for 3-4 minutes.
Add 1 ml of LB broth and incubate the cells at 37°C for 1-1.5 hr in a water bath with gentle shaking.
