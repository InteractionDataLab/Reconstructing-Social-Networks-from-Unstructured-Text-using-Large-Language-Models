Agenda
Micro-cracks in Concrete
The team decided on the project on the 3rd March 2010. During the meeting, possible problems and tasks required were suggested and discussed.
The previous team has done the BioBrick for the glue. If we were to use glue, we'd have to make it work or to improve it as an ''improvement on an existing biobrick''
Plans and problems
Creating micro-cracks
Electron microscopy
Glue/CaCO3/spider silk
Getting into crack: a) micro-injection (i) new buildings external cracks (ii) damp-protecting b) mix with concrete (modify spore coats), existing concrete c) soak up through pores
Sporulation, germination and secretion control, also kill switch
Contact inhibition (2 bacteria contact, then divide), quorum sensing
Surface tension of water needs to be solved due to the small micro-cracks
The delivery of nutrients is also a problem
Because the bacteria will sporulate in water, we have to make sure that there’s no sporulation during rain before the cracks form (sporulation factors) or during mixing (does this weaken the structure?)
What actually causes sporulation and germination need to be researched into
Genetics: homologous recombination, plasmid, chromosome
Glue secretion – cell lysis
Variation in bacterial population
Properties of concrete: porosity; air and water, e.g. frost leads to further crack damage and formation
Bacteria need to secrete, germinate and sporulate before micro cracks can be used
Cracks can be hard to solve due to the brittle property
Ultrasound to detect the cracks and whether it has worked
Registration to iGEM 2010
Phil hasn't applied.
Visa/Passport
Harsh and Zoltan are in the progress of visa application. Phil, Younus and Rachel haven't completed the online visa exception form.
Action Points
All members: Research about the concrete idea and be familiarise with what are required
All members: Visa exception form
Zoltan, Harsh, Phill: Visa/Passport
Neil and Jen: Search for a civil engineer and a graphics designer
Richard: Scan through the two existing concrete projects to see if anything was missing
Other businesses:
It was mentioned, as well as in the previous meeting, that the iGEM Wiki should be used as soon as possible to avoid further merging later on. However, the contents might be available to the public and this issue is to be discussed with Neil and Jen.
Logo design for the project can now be considered.
Next Meeting
Formal meeting: Wednesday (10/03/2010) at 4pm in CLT 9.22
