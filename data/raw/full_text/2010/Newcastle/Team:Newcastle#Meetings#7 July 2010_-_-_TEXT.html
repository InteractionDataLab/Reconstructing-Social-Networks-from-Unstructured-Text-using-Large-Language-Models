Agenda
Roll call
Everyone present except Rachel, Colin and Jen
Research feedback
Swarming function. sfP and swrA genes needed from 3610 marburg strain. Swarming depends on the two-component system of comP and comA which is activated by comX and csF. ComA then activate srfABCD, leadint to surfactin production. comS will also be activated which is for competence. Surfactin may break the surface tension to allow movement. Frameshift mutation is the sfP gene which is needed for the post translational modification of the surfactin. Mutation in the swrA too, which is needed for the flagella biosynthesis. Surfactin also an amp, however the immunity gene is found in the 168 strain.
Gibson cloning to disrupt the frame shift mutation. Neil, Jem and Wendy is working on the Gibson method. Faster way to sticking the biobrick together.
Lab feedback
Arginine tests - Harsh and Alan. No pH change observed. Use a minimal medium, as other nitrogen source might be present in LB.
Urea tests - Harsh and Alan. Pink colour change observed. Urea being breakdown by B subtilis.
DNA extraction - Da and Deena. Extract DNA from strain 3633.  Needed for rocF and spa genes.
LacI extraction - Phil and Younus. Extracted lacI from pMutin4 plasmid.
Logo and T-shirts
Put CBCB logo on the T-shirt
Visas
Harsh to travel to London on 160710.
Travel plans
Book flights from 041110 to the 081110
