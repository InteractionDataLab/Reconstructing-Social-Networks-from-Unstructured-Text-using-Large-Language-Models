Formal meeting - 26th March 2010
Room: CBCB; Start: 11 am

Present: Jen, Janetta, Neil, Steven,Younus, Da, Alan, Richard, Harsh
Apologies: Phil (holiday), Jem and Matt
Approval of agenda and minutes - Approved
Agenda
Research Feedback
Properties of concrete and surface tension (Zoltan and Steven)
High compressive strength low tensile strength
Steal added good for temp change
CaCO3 – similar to concrete; expand same as concrete - might crack like concrete
Spider silk like steal - reduce possibility of cracking
Glue - no many papers - expansion may not be a problem?
Silk alkali resistant
Capillary properties of concrete change over time- in project we consider small rapid
Cement water ratio and surface area and environment
Where to look for the cracks? Crack pattern
Microinjection (Zoltan and Steven)
Simple issue
Not correct term
Swimming Bacillus
Oxygen gradient big selling points
Genetics Homologous recombination plasmid chromosome (Harsh and Rachel)
Test in plasmids- Find good plasmid
Integrate into genome
Recombination site... Find!!!
amyE site amylase with insert can’t break down amylase
Nutrients (Harsh and Rachel)
Bacteria algae growth living in concrete
Only activate feed bacillus
Two hybrid
Biofilms exclude other not algae
Antifungals, antialgaes, antibiotic
Sporulation, germination and secretion control (Alan and Da)
SpoA – last years team sporulation control, maybe turn off completely
Nutrient availability
KinA
Inducible promoter
Glue out of bug
Quorum sensing (Younus and Phil)
CompX and cff
Two-component system comP
Kill switch (Richard and Jannetta)
Why ? Don’t want?- not die after job fill new cracks
Nuclease
Phil mazEF
Skf SbB
If linear DNA works
Glue, CaCo3 and spider silk (Zoltan and Jannetta)
Bacteria that produce CaCo3 from urea
How secrete spider silk long complex proteins – how can we make it happen in bacillus
Secretion systems
Other points
Linear DNA – Richard
Justifications of Linear
Build it up the use
Mutations
Not specifically a problem – keep thinking about it though
Action points
All - Read Voigt paper
All - Next week working off the proper wiki
Janetta contact details doc in drop box
Janetta and Richard – Flow chart!!!
Reminder to neil and jen not welcome trust funding by 2nd of April?
Janetta - T-shirt sponsors and logo – embroidered / print mixed – 5 or 6 sponsors design your own- printing cheaper, quotes dependent on design
Jannetta - send us links for graphic design software- please
Transfer the wiki
Individual iGEM applications - Phil hasn’t applied; Richard not accepted; Janetta text Phil
Jen/Neil - Pay for team!!
Visas/Passport update - Harsh will apply May/June; Richard needs to get a visa waiver
Wiki transfer
Clarify contents of identified pages
Ethics page
Research page
Safety page
Identify other pages required
Ideas for layout/theme
Zoltan - Tidy it up - Urgent
Borrow last years / Look at anything thats nice
It evolves!!! We can change it
Travel plans
Flights and Accomodation
Need to sort out  who is going
Funding
Harsh has made draft letter
Main chemical company – free stuff?
Advisors/additional team members - civil engineer/graphics designer
Still looking – Neil, Jen
Tutorials
Sequentia and Clone manager - basics
Modelling part two
What next?
Flow chart of what we’re going to do Big picture!!!
If its coloured life is easier
Cambridge brick - Colour
Web services for Biosynthetics, Flow chart
Taverner
Timeline discussion
Need someone else on time line.
16th of June Lab induction
Deadlines soon
Change flight deadline – not 31st
Other business
PDF mark up tools – PDF exchange viewer, foxit, keeps mark-up
Making dropbox use better
Items for next agenda
Need wiki transferred by next meeting
Review of flow chart if done
