Urease Test
Aims
The aim of this experiment was to determine if Bacillus subtilis 168 is able to produce urease and degrade urea.
Procedures
The experiment was performed on 01.07.10. Please refer to Urease test .
Results

Figure 1: Urease test results
Negative control - No color change (Orange color)
Test 1 (Duplicate) - Pink-red color
Test 2 (Duplicate) - Pink-red color
Discussion
B. subtilis 168 is able to produce urease, therefore, urea which is the substrate and can be found in the agar was degraded, which results in ammonia building. The ammonia makes the media alkaline and therefore the indicator phenol red will change from orange color to pink-red color. The negative control did not turn pink-red color, therefore indicating that no contamination had occurred.
Conclusion
From the experiment it can be concluded that Bacillus subtilis 168 produces urease enzyme in order to break down urea and produces ammonium and carbonate ions.
Competent E. coli DH5α Production
Aims
To make a stock of competent E. coli (DH5α strain) ready for transformation.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to: competent for materials and protocol.
Inference
We created a stock of competent E. coli (DH5α strain) that an be used for future transformations to grow up/replicate plasmids.
