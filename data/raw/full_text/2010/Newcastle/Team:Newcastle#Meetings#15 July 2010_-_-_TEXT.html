Agenda
Roll call
Everyone present except Colin Harwood
Presentation
Rachel - Introduction
Harsh - General Outlook
Alan - Swarming BioBrick, Urease BioBrick
Steve - Subtilin cell-signalling System, Computational model of SR1
Younus - LacI BioBrick, yneA BioBrick
Suggestions: One slide to list all Biobricks, a conclusion at the end, an introduction to microbacteria, costs of earthquake buildings, amount of co2 emitted from cement production, photo of hand drawn BioBrick process, put more animation/pictures and less words on slides, models that were drawn (sbml, copasi), point to things on screen when presenting, use clear colours for words, darker backgrounds with lighter words look better, make sure border not cut off, have logo on top right corner, get rid of spider web, images of ahrC and SR1 on slides.
Research feedback
SR1 BioBrick
Done with SR1 BioBrick. Cloning strategy of SR1.
SR1 - argenine, rocF - arginase
Lab feedback
Phil and Younus - LacI Transformation, MiniPrep and Restriction digests
Transformants with LacI and RFP in it. Not sure how to test if LacI is in the plasmid
Whether gel, transformation worked, Miniprep did not work, plasmid moving at the wrong band (too many bands)
Arrangement in lab - yneA (synthesizing), SR1 (Sending to synthesize), Swarming
Have Bacillus parts in one place (ask Wendy)
