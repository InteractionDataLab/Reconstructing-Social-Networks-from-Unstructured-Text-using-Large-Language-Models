Agenda
Roll calls
Apologies: Janetta, Phil, Alan, Deena and Wendy
Absence: Matt, Jem, Colin Harwood and Colin Davie
Judging Criteria
Medal criteria is a very big priority. We're running out of time, so we must look at the gold requirements.
Modelling
Metabolic Flux Balance Analysis - alter enzyme levels to produce different outcomes and makes complex modelling to be seen easier. We need to compare the actual lab work and the modelling to spot any changes, and if so, state the reason.
Lab feedback
Gibson cloning - Primers are not working. New primers are expected to arrive
Subtilin immunity - Same as rocF
yneA - Transforming into Bacillus subtilis 168 strains now
Concrete
Three cracked concrete samples picked up. Can be taken into the lab
Use of Electron Microscope (EM) to see the detailed cracks within the concrete
Wendy has ordered Natto and the other strain, but have not yet arrived
Wiki
Lab book is up to date.
Visas
ESTA must be completed (if required) ASAP.
Publicity
Interview from India.
Finance
The transportation will be free, but most of the foods will need to be covered by individuals.
Action points
Steve - Go through each point on the medal criteria list and write a couple of sentences about how we're going to tackle them
Steve - Look into Metabolic Flux Balance Analysis and the softwares that are related to it
Steve - Ask Collin Harwood about Bacillus sphaericus
Harsh - Read the paper about Bacillus sphaericus
Neil and Jen - Ask Peter Andras
Everyone - Complete (if required) ESTA forms ASAP
Item(s) for next agenda
Go through the presentation slides and refine. Cut down the number of slides so that it fits the 20 minutes time limit
