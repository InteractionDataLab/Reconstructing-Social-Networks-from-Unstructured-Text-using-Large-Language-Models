Gel electrophoresis for the subtilin immunity fragments
Aims
The aim of the experiment is to check whether we have the correct fragment sizes on the four subtilin fragments that are we have amplified yesterday .
Materials and protocol
Please refer to the gel electrophoresis protocol.
Results
Figure 1: Gel electrophoresis of the PCR products of the parts required for the subtilin immunity BioBrick.
Lane 1: 1 kb DNA ladder
Lane 2: Plasmid Vector (pSB1C3)
Lane 3: Promoter and RBS (pVeg-SpoVG)
Lane 4: spaIFEG Gene Cluster
Lane 5: Double terminator
Lane 6: 100 bp DNA ladder
Discussion
The correct band size were observed for for the Plasmid Vector (lane 2), Promoter & RBS (lane 3) and Double terminator (lane 5). However no band was observed  for the spaIFEG(lane 4).
Conclusion
No band was observed for the spaIFEG. This could be due to the wrong melting temperature.
