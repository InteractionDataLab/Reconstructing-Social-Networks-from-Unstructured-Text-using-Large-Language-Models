Plasmid Miniprep Experiment
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to extract plasmid DNA pSB1C3 and pSB1AK3 with BBa_B0014 from E. coli DH5α cells using the Qiagen miniprep kit and analysing with the Nanodrop machine.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to: Minipreps for Qiagen miniprep protocol, Nanodrop Spectrophotometer for nanodrop protocol and Restriction digests for restriction digestion protocol. NOTE: 10 µl of RNAse A have been added into the current P1 buffer from Qiagen.

Discussion
Bands around 3000 bp were observed in lanes 2, 3 and 4, thereby indicating the correct products. Lane 5 contain the LacI plasmid, therefore it should be bigger in size as compared to the double terminator plasmid which is in lane 6. Therefore lane 5 might not contain the LacI plasmid. From the nanodrop results, the ratio of 260:280 nm ranged from 1.7 to 1.85 and the concentration ranged from 92.1 µl/ml to 246.7 µl/ml. These results indicated that the DNA extracted have low contamination and the samples are pure.
Conclusion
Extraction of pSB1C3 plasmid and pSB1AK3 with BBa_B0014 plasmid containing the double terminator have been successful. As well as the addition of RNAse into the P1 buffer solved the problem of contamination.
