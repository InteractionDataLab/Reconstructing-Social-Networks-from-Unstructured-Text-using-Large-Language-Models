Checking for transformants
Today we checked for transformants from the filamentous Bacillus subtilis transformation (with pMutin4) we performed yesterday.
We checked our transformants under the light microscope, expecting to see a non-filamentous phenotype since the cells had not been induced with IPTG. The resutls were as expected.
