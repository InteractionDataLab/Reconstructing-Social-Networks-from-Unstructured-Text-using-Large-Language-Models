Workflows
Jannetta developed an e-Science Approach to Synthetic Biology with a focus on workflows. She proposed a new standard for a RESTful API which facilitates the discovery and publication of models of functional biological units. The RFC has been submitted to the BioBrick Foundation as BBF RFC 66 .
T-shirt Design
The design was formed by Younus, Jannetta and Harsh and the whole team approved the design for the current t-shirt.
Poster Design
The design was put forward by Younus and Rachel and the whole team approved the design.
Presentation Design
The design was put forward by Younus and Jannetta and the whole team approved the design.
Instructors and Advisors
All of our Instructors and Advisors have provided us with their invaluable help and guidance throughout the span of the project.
Prof. Anil Wipat and Dr Jennifer Hallinan have provided us with their invaluable guidance and expertise throughout the length of the project.
Dr Wendy Smith gave us introductory lab session and taught us about the lab safety. She also supervised us throughout our stay in the lab (often into the the early hours :-)
Dr Matthew Pocock helped us with the presentation design and talk.
Prof. Colin Harwood and Dr Jem Stach suggested the antisense RNA approach for the SR1 BioBrick Part. They also helped us in writing the cloning strategies.
Dr Colin Davie provided advice and access to the Civil Engineering labs to prepare and crack concrete.
Mr Goksel Misirili provided help and expertise with modelling.
Details of this work can be found on the Solution , Modelling and Lab book pages. This work is unrelated to the work done by the labs of our instructors and advisors.
