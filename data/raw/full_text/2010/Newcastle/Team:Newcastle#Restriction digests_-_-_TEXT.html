Restriction digestion
Materials required
Eppendorf tubes
Pipettes
Appropriate DNA/plasmid
Appropriate restriction enzymes
10X buffer
Water
Procedures
Add the following as mentioned below to make up to a final volume of 20 µl of reaction mix:
15 µl of DNA/plasmid
1 µl of restriction enzyme 1
1 µl of restriction enzyme 2
2 µl of 10X buffer
1 µl of water
Incubate the digestion mixture at 37°C for 3 hours
Notes
No more than 10% of enzyme should be used for a single reaction - glycerol inhibits reaction
10x buffer must be diluted to 1x i.e. 10% final volume.
