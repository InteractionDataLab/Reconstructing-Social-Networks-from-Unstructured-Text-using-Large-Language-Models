Agenda
Roll calls
Apologies: Neil
Absence: Matt, Jem, Colin Harwood and Colin Davie
T-shirts
T-shirts are almost ready. However, everyone needs to send their preferred names to Janetta to be printed onto the T-shirts. The actual printing will take approximately a week.
Judging Criteria
We should focus on one of the Gold requirements and if there is any extra time, another requirement can be tackled
Possibly look at other teams' wiki pages to identify any area that we may potentially be able to help - perhaps St Andrews' modelling???
Modelling
Modelling should be the main focus after the lab work - after August.
Lab feedback
Gibson cloning - find out whether it's worked tomorrow
Subtilin immunity - ongoing, currently doing gel electrophoresis and extraction
Research feedback
All the research feedbacks are done. For now, no need for anymore.
Wiki
Lab book is up to date
Visas
Deena to travel to London tomorrow (12.08.2010)
