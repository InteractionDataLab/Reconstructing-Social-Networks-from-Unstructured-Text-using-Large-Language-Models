Characterization of yneA
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to prepare slides for the Bacillus subtilis 168 cells which have yneA on the plasmid (pMutin4 and pMap65) and under lacI regulation and are induced by IPTG at various concentrations.
Materials and Protocol
Please refer to: Slide preparation for IPTG induced cells for materials and protocol. For this experiment we used the following cell colonies:
Bacillus subtilis 168
Bacillus subtilis 168 with pMutin4 having yneA insert
Bacillus subtilis 168 tith pMap65 having yneA insert
Today we see the cells on a flourescent microscope.
Result and Conclusion
Please refer to: Characterisation for the result.
