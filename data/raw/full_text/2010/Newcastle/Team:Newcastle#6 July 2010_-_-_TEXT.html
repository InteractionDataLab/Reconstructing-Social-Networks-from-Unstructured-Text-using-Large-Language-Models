Genomic DNA extraction from Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC 6633
Aim
The aim of this experiment was to extract genomic DNA from Bacillus subtilis strain ATCC 6633. This strain has the subtilin genes, required for our Subtilin Production and Immunity parts.
Protocol
Please refer to: DNA extraction of Bacillus subtilis for materials required and protocol.
Results
Results were as expected  see: https://2010.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/7_July_2010
Conclusion
See: https://2010.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/7_July_2010
Research
Today we also continued with our research on filamentous cells which will act as reinforcing fibres in the crack.
