Formal Meeting - 30 September 2010
Everyone present, Apologies: Colin Harwood
Agenda
T-shirts
Our iGEM T-shirts have arrived!
Previous action points
DNA has to received by iGEM by the 27th October, so it must be send by the 20th. Send by Fedex.
Judging form is not avaliable yet.
Lab feedback
Filamentous cells
We have microscope photos and data on IPTG concentration against cell length.
Measure length of non-LacI repressed cells too.
Need scatter graph, error bars.
Need distribution. Record min and max.
SR1
We have colonies.
Scanning electron microscopy
Should be ready on Monday.
Presentation
Practice Friday 8th October.
Wiki
We have a new design. Will be implemented soon.
Action points
Steven and Harsh: remind Wendy to send off DNA.
Rachel and Phil: Characterisation data for filamentous cells brick needs to be put on the wiki and the parts registry.
Get ready for the talk on the 15th October.
Judging form is due in three weeks, but isn't available yet.
Younus: Make sure the poster is the right resolution and ratio for A0. Save as .pdf when sending for printing. Leave enough time to check the pre-print (2 or 3 days). Probably needs to be 10x higher resolution than you might think, so it isn't blocky even at very high zoom. Use vector graphics.
Next meeting
Wednesday, 6th October, 4 p.m.
Chair: Rachel, Computer: Deena, Minutes: Phil
