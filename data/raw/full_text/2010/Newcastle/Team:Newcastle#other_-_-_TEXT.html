Questions
Questions asked about our presentation:
Would this project require us to change the strength of the filamentous cells in relation to different types of concrete?
What is the strength of filamentous cells? How do filamentous cells actually help to fill up the cracks?
How can repairing microcracks in concrete help to prevent a building collapsing in an earthquake?
