David Owen - Cell Biology
I am a cell biologist with a focus on neuroscience. I was attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of iGem and also by the opportunity to do novel research in a fairly independent manner. In my opinion I bring: a general understanding of lab procedure; a try anything once attitude and an appreciation of malt whisky to the team.
I am hoping that this project will lead to me being more skilled and comfortable in the lab, it will also provide me with exposure to an area of science that would have been unavailable otherwise.
