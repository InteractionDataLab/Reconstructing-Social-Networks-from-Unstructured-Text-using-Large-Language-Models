Now this is the story all about how my skills got flipped turned upside down
And I’d like to take a minute.
Just sit right there.
I’ll tell you how I became technician of a lab called St A.
In east aalen, Stadtkreis, my cultures were raised.
On the thermo cycler is where I spend most of my days.
restrictin’, incubatin, ligating, all cool and all.
shootin’ some plasmids outside of the plan.
when a couple of Docs who were up to no good started makin’ soup in my eppendorf.
I got one little colony and the boss got scared.
And said, “You’re movin’ with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air".

I like ordinary differential equation, but I am in fact exceptional. I breathe stochastically and I eat rate constants for breakfast, also green berets.  As a physicist I am disappointed that we are not making BioBricks out of the individual protons, neutrons and electrons. They would work much better as standard parts and can easily be captured from the wild without PCR. New parts could be generated automatically by colliding technical and legal standards at Cern, I will therefore be known to as the Collider in Chief.
Patrick Olden
My love is like a red red rose that newly springs in June, if you don’t see that is an illusion to the modelling of quorum sensing then there is no hope for you. Because we all know that it springs at 0.008 arbitrary units per mouse intestine on up regulation and at a somewhat smaller but quantitatively unknown value on down regulation. That is enough about me since I must now leave to play that funky music. Peace out.
David Owen
I am a cell biologist with a focus on neuroscience. I was attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of iGem and also by the opportunity to do novel research in a fairly independent manner. In my opinion I bring: a general understanding of lab procedure; a try anything once attitude and an appreciation of malt whisky to the team. I am hoping that this project will lead to me being more skilled and comfortable in the lab, it will also provide me with exposure to an area of science that would have been unavailable otherwise.

Teh Sarah is teh b0mb. Teh Sarah is teh statmaster, which is like a stairmaster but does not provide a calf work out. It does however provide a mind work out. Teh iGem crew has a wikid strong mind, cos i am all up in their statistical grills questionairing their preconcieved ideas.
James Taylor
I am a chemist from Lancaster. The opportunity to join this iGem team is the reason I chose to study at St Andrews. You may not think that this is interesting but St Andrews did not have an iGem team when I applied, therefore extraordinary prescience on my part was required. I use this talent to determine whether or not experiments will be successful before they have even taken place, this allows huge savings to be made on lab materials. I also know the final results of the competition but am keeping them secret for betting purposes.
Jonathan Ward
My name is Jaunty and I am the jauntiest person in the world. Sometimes people ask me how I can be so jaunty and I tell them that it is a gift. It can not be learned or shared. You either have it or you don’t. However, other people can bask in my reflected self confident air and buoyant personality which leads to massive productivity gains. It is for this reason that I am on the St Andrews iGEM team and it is why someday, I will be king.
