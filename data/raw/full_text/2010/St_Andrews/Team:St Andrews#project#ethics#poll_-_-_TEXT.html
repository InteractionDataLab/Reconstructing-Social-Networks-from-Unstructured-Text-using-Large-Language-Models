Poll
This poll is taken during the summer time in St Andrews. The participants primiarly consisted of tourists visiting St Andrews during the Open Golf tournement, students and locals. Questions were answered according to a five-point Likert scale. The survey was posed in two forms, one regarding synthetic biology and the other regarding genetic engineering. The questions asides from the subject at hand were otherwise identical. The reasoning behind this survey was to assert the different in perception between two very similar fields and how public opinion has been effected by recent developments in the field.
