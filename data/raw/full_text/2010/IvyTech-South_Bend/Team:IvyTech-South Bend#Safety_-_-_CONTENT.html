Working with an microbe that has been the recipient of recombinant DNA and given antibiotic resistance is always raises both research and environmental safety concerns.  However, appropriate steps to have been taken to prevent accidental release of the microbe into the lab environment.  Organisms that possessed recombinant DNA and antibiotic resistance were grown and manipulated under controlled conditions and disposed of as hazardous medical waste.
