6/28/10
Preparing SOB
6/30/10
Richard Lab:Electroporation of E. coli
7/28/10
Usage and extraction
8/24/10
Today we will be pouring new plates for streaking new transformed cells.
8/27/10
We will be running a gel to determine if our DNA sample was successfully electroplated.
8/27/10
Today we will be electroplating part KBBa_3131010
8/31/10
Results of transformation - the plates had growth but (no) distinct colony pattern.
8/31/10
After agar is dissolved, and allowed to cool, I will add Amp in different doses to specific plates. JH
9/1/10
Today the team will be making up the same plates as I made yesterday. Professor T. wants new Amp stock made to document how much is used into the stock.
9/2/10
Results from streaking –
9/2/10
Protocol For Making LB-Broth/Agar
9/3/10
Today I’m finishing making the LB/Agar from yesterday.
9/9/10
Due to conflict we will be changing from E Coli to yeast.
9/10/10
Lux Casette Right Promoter BBa_I1051
9/14/10
Today we found growth from our Electroporated E – Coli parts
9/15/10
Today we will be extracting DNA from out electroporated cells/T9002 B-galactosidase Assay
9/16/10
Today we will wash
9/17/10
Today we will be doing a DNA Extraction from/of part T9002 for electroporation this will determine if we have a stable host for our beast this will also Work!
10/18/10
cutting enzymes
9/21/10
Today we will electroporate  Agrobacterium with part T9002
Electrophoresis
9/22/10
Today we have growth from electroporation done yesterday we are going to test by hitting with (AHL) the 20 mL grew not 5 mL sample
9/22/10
The only one that should glow should be (C)/(3) E – Coli w/transformed part in LB For Supernate of A.Tumafaciens
9/23/10
Today I have been setting up for the trial of our part T9002 inside agrobacteria to see if in the presence of AHL it floureces.
9/24/10
Today I’m testing absorbance of our trials @ 395nm
9/28/10
Today we will be picking 2 colonies from the Lacz, LuxR electroporated plates that were streaked on 9/22/10
9/30/10
LacZ without GFP also with RBS and terminator
