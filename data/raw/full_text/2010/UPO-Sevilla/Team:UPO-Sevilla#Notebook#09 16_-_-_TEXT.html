September, 16th
Assembly Team
We observed no colonies in the control plates and one colony (very skinny) in the (1+2+16+3) selection plate. Let's let it grow. We set up one inoculum of the colony.
Assay Team
The soft agar assays suggest the problem is the K12 strains’ motility. We‘ve asked Mr. Sandy Parkinson for a new strain.
