August, 11th
Assembly Team
We had a lot of red and white colonies in every plate; except on: 12+19, 11+2+13+3 and 1+2+16+3 plates. There were no colonies on control plates. We made colony PCR reactions for six colonies from each plate. Agarose gel analysis showed that running time was too long. We could not rule out anything, so we set up inocula of each candidate.
We set up inocula of positive candidate from UPO 4, UPO 5 and UPO 11 plates. We made minipreps and analytic digestions with the day before inocula. 0.8% agarosa gel analysis confirmed 2+18 and 2+4+2+6.
We made colony PCR by using colonies from 18+3 and 2+6+2+5+3 plates: no positive results.
