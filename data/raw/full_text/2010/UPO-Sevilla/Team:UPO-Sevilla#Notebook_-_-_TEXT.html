Firstly we organized the work in teams.
When we planned the project the WetLab Team was divided in two conceptual teams in order to focus on the two main theoretical subjects of the project: Sensing Team (David Caballero and Eva Fernández) and Chemotaxis-Adhesion Team (Adrián Arellano, Paola Gallardo and Félix Reyes). Next, when we got to the lab we had to divide the lab work among the WetLab Team and this division it is shown below. The WetLab team was supervised by Fernando Govantes.
Production Team
Members: David Caballero and Paola Gallardo. Each component carries out individual work.
Goal: Biobrick synthesis by PCR and SDM (site-directed mutagenesis) by using E. coli K12 (wild type) DNA as a template. Parts to be amplified are fecA*, fecR*, fecI, PfecA, gltB, gltD**. Asterisk means presence of restriction targets: *PstI or **PstI and EcoRI.
Assembly Team
Members: Adrián Arellano, Félix Reyes and Eva Fernández.
Goal: Building of biobrick devices mainly by 3A Assembly and Standard Assembly.
Assays Team
Members: Félix Reyes and David Caballero.
Goal: Testing the final project, mainly by chemotaxis assays, as well as some used biobriks.
On other hand, the DryLab Team consists of Eduardo Pavón under Luis Merino supervision, assistant manager of the Escuela Politécnica Superior. Despite the fact that this was a small group, the drylab designed the wiki page and developed mathematical and computers models.
In spite of this separation, all subteams are in contact and we help each other to rise our objectives.
