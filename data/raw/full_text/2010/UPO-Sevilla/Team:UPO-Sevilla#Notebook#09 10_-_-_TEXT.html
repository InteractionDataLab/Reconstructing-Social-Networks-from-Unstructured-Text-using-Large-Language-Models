September, 10th
Production Team
We changed some conditions to improve our PCR results:
We used new Pfu enzyme, buffer and dNTP.
Templates: we diluted the high concentrated fragment (1/10) and used 2ul instead of 1ul of the low concentrated one.
0’8% gel electrophoresis analysis showed a line of 1Kb, which is the length of fecR. There was also a 0’2Kb line. It looked like that the new conditions carried us to the goal. We had to isolate from gel the new part: WE GOT FECR!
Assembly Team
We realized a new ligation of the failed biobricks and digested not available biobricks (2+6) and vectors (pSB1C3 and pSB1T3).
Assay Team
We developed different assays by changing different features; the plates were incubated overnight.
