October, 19th
Assay Team
We adjusted O.D. of cultures to the proper one, prepared chambers and capillaries with the different media(aspartate or motility buffer) and checked assays at 30ºC and at RT. We took microscopy images every 15 minutes(till 60') in the entrance of the capillaries. Also, we emptied the content of capillaries in Eppendorfs containing 200ul of motility buffer. We spread dilutions on LB+Ap plates.
