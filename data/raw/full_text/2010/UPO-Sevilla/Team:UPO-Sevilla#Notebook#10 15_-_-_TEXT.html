October, 15th
Assay Team
Today we have prepared new chemotaxis assays: Adler capillary assay, Adler capillary assay in 96-well PVC microplates and capillary assay using syringe and needles’ cap. The aim was to carry out a good chemotaxis assay definitely.
We have set up inocula of E. coliRP437 and RP6665 in minimal medium with glycerol and supplements at 30º in low shaking overnight.
