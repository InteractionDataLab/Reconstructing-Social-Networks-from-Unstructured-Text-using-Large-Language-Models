October, 5th
Assembly Team
We have set up inocula of 13+3 different colonies.
Digestion of UPO 16+3 (2h, 37ºC) to clone them at pSB3T5 (final vector of 12+2+16+3 circuit). Digestion was run in a 0.8% agarose gel and the positive spot was isolated and purified using GFX. The purification was quantified by Nanodrop. Ligation of 16+3/3T5.
Digestion of UPO4, UPO5 and UPO11 (2h, 37ºC) to clone them at pSB1C3. Digestions were run in an agarose gel and positive spots were isolated and purified using GFX. Ligation of UPO4, 5 and 11/1C3.
