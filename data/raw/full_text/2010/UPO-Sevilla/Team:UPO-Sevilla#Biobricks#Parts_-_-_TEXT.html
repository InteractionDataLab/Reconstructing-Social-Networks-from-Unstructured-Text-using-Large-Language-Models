Parts
In this site you can find all the parts iGEM team UPO-Sevilla had been working on.
BioBricks names give you information about the kind of BioBrick and it is a good way to work with a big quantity of parts ( see more ). But it is hard to write these long names in a microcentrifuge tube! That is why we used a second numerical name for each part. Numerical names are easier to work with in the lab and also to organize the work. You will see this code next to standard names. This will help you to understand other issues of Bacterial Crowding project, like Circuits and Devices.

Description
Prh System
UPO-04
BBa_K367000
prhA
Coding sequence
Synthesis
Ralstonia solanacearum gene prhA, encoding an outer membrane protein                             that senses a signal on plant cell walls and transduces it through the                             bacterial cell envelop to stimulate transcription from several operons.                             Optimized sequence to be expressed in Escherichia coli.
UPO-05
BBa_K367001
prhR
Coding sequence
Synthesis
Ralstonia solanacearum gene prhR, encoding a membrane signal transduction                             protein involved in the Prh pathway. The nondiffusible plant cell wall                             signal is transduced by the N-terminal extension of PrhA to the C-terminal                             part of the transmembrane protein PrhR and then through PrhR across the                             cytoplasmic membrane. Optimized sequence to be expressed in Escherichia coli.
UPO-06
BBa_K367002
prhI
Coding sequence
Synthesis
Ralstonia solanacearum gene prhI, encoding an ECF sigma factor responsible                             for transcription dependent on the Prh signal transduction system. PrhI                             is activated by PrhR and then the sigma factor induces the expression by                             activating PprhJ promoter. Optimized sequence to be expressed in Escherichia coli.
UPO-11
BBa_K367008
PprhJ
Promoter
Synthesis
The PprhJ promoter region, responsive to plant cell contact via signal transduction                             by PrhA and PrhR and activation by ECF sigma factor PrhI. Optimized sequence to be                             expressed in Escherichia coli.
Hybrid Protein
UPO-07
BBa_K367006
fecA-prhA
Coding sequence
Synthesis
Artificial coding sequence spanning the first 92 codons of fecA, encoding the signal                             peptide (aa. 1-33), the proposed Ton-box (aa. 54-63), fused to the distal end of                             the prhA coding sequence at the conserved GSGL motif (aa. 89-92). This hybrid                             protein allows to sense nondifusible signals and to transduce it by the well known                             Fec pathway. Optimized sequence to be expressed in Escherichia coli.
Fec System
UPO-08
BBa_K367003
fecA
Coding sequence
Finally not made
Gene fecA of Escherichia coli, encoding an outer membrane ferric citrate sensor that                             initiates signal transduction via FecR and FecI to activate transcription.
UPO-28
BBa_K367012
fecI&fecR
Two overlapping coding sequences
Finally not made
fecI and fecR genes of Escherichia coli, encoding an ECF sigma factor and a membrane                             signal transduction protein respectively, involved in signal transduction of the ferric                             citrate-dependent Fec system. They have been synthesized in the same Biobrick because                             of their 4 bp overlap, not to reduce their expression. FecR protein interacts with the                             outer membrane sensor FecA and activates the sigma factor FecI, which acts over PfecA promoter region.
UPO-12

Escherichia coli PfecA promoter region, repressed by Fur under iron excess, and                             induced by ferric citrate through the FecA-FecR signal transduction pathway and                             the FecI ECF sigma factor.
