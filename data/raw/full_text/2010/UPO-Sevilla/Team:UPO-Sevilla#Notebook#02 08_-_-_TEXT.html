Production Team
Paola Gallardo. We started a new round of PCR for SDM, but this time we prepared five samples of each one. We ran an electrophoresis to check the products and we had only got positive results for fecI-fecR.
David Caballero. SDM is made by two PCR reactions. We performed the first PCR reactions for fecA*,gltD** and fecI-fecR* parts. gltD** had two restriction enzyme target. One of them was really near of start codon so we would get it out of there using a longer primer which overlapped the target site. After PCR reactions were performed, samples were running in electrophoresis gel. All samples were perfect. We purified samples from gel and performed the second SDM PCR reaction for each part. Results would be analyzed the next day.

Mr Gene biobricks have come! YIPPEE!!.
Today has been a hard day: On the one hand, we analyzed several devices using colony PCR (different candidates from the following plates: 12+2, 12+19, 18+3 and 1+19) and we had unsuccessful results. Probably, our PCR reactions were contaminated. On the other hand, some biobricks were digested, ligated and transformated (2+4, 2+5, 2+6, 2+7, 4+2, 5+2, 6+2, 7+2, 11+2, 2+3 and 11+19).
