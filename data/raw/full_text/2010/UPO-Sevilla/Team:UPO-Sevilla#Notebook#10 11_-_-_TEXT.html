October, 11th
Assembly Team
Minipreps of 1+2+7+3 different inocula and digestion of them (2h, 37ºC).  22 samples were run in an agarose gel.  Results were negative. This device has a problem: either it is not viable or 1+2 quantity is not enough.  Other UPO 1+2 preparation was made but using more DNA.
Ligation of 12+2+13+3 (3A and SA).
