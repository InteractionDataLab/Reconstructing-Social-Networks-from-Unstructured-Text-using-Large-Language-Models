October, 16th
Assay Team
We have gone on the chemotaxis assay by preparing the bacterial dilution as Adler had proposed. After that, we have set up the different chemotaxis assays according to our protocols (see project – assay). The experiments were incubated at 30ºC for an hour. We measured the bacterial population by fluorescence since our bacteria had gfp.
The results have still been negative. We are desperate!
