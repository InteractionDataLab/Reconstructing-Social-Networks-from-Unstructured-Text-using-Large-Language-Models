Paola Gallardo. Wow!!! We got colonies in all plates, except for the control of two vectors. So that is fantastic. The colonies had two colors, red (bacteria with bad digested vectors) and white (bacteria have plasmid that have been digested and ligated properly). Some colonies of each plate was selected and we made analytic PCR reactions to check the results.
David Caballero. Purification of parts we amplified by PCR the day before. We saved these parts in order to use it for transformation if the spread plates, transformed using parts obtained by PCR in other reactions, did not show positive results.
