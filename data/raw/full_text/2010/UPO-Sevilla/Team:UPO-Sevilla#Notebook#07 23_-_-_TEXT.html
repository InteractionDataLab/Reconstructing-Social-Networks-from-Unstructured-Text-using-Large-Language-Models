July, 23rd
Production Team
Paola Gallardo. We start with new SDM with the same genes.
David Caballero. Plate analysis: there were colonies but they were tiny to count it. We let them at 37ºC all day long in order to see bigger colonies.
Assembly Team
We did the last check of UPO1+2. UPO1+2 was digested with Nhe1 because UPO1 has two restriction sites and UPO2 lacks of them. If agarose gel electrophoresis shows the lineal form we ́ll have a positive candidate.
DryLab Team
Web: iGEM Spanish web released. Navigator compatibility developments worked on.
