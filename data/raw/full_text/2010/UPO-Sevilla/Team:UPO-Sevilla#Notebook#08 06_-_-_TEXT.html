August, 6th
Production Team
Minipreps were prepared from inocula. We digested with EcoRI and PstI for 2 hours at 37ºC. We ran an electrophoresis of the digestion products and we observed 1'5 kb fragments. We've got fecI-fecR. Colony PCR seems not to be a reliable proof.
Assembly Team
We used 3A method to build: 1+2+7+2, 11+2+13+3, 12+2+13+3, 11+2+16+3 and 12+2+16+3. The necessary steps were: digestion with accurate digestion enzyme, ligation and transformation. Plates were incubated at 37º over night.
Minpreps using inocula we set up the day before. Analytic digestion confirmed the next biobriks: UPO6, UPO7, UPO2+6, UPO12+2 and UPO11+2.
