July, 22nd
Production Team
Paola Gallardo. Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM): First try with gltD** and fecI-fecR*, using an overlapping PCR reaction. We analyzed the products of the first round. Fail. We'll try again
David Caballero. Transformation of competent bacteria with ligation products we made the day before. We spread them in LB+Cm plates and let them grow overnight at 37ºC.
Assembly Team
UPO1+2 was analized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis again. Results showed three bands with the same size, so our candidate is negative. We started again with UPO1+2: digesting, binding, transforming.
