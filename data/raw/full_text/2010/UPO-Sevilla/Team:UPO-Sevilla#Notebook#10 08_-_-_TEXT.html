Minipreps of 16+3 different inocula and digestion of them (2h, 37ºC). Samples were run in a 0.8% agarose gel. UPO16+3/3T5 was confirmed.
Minipreps and digestion of UPO4, 5 and 11/1C3 inocula (2h, 37ºC). Samples were run in a 0.8% agarose gel.  We had to repeat these digestions because there were little DNA quantity. Digestion again.
Transformation of 13+3/3T5 ligations in DH5α.
Digestion of UPO 1+2 and 7+3 (2h, 37ºC). Preparations were run in a 0.8% agarose gel and purified by using GFX. Ligation of 1+2+7+3.
12+2 primers pair were denatured and renatured. UPO 16+3 was digested (to 3A and SA) and checked by electrophoresis gel. Spots were isolated and purified using GFX.
