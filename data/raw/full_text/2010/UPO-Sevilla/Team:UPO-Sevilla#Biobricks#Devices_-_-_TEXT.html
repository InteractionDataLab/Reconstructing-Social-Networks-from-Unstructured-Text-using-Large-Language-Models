Devices
In this section all devices we designed at the beginning of the summer are shown in a schematic way. You can see parts which make up each device and required inputs to perform each particular output. Another important information is the use of each device. Finally we present the optimized assembly strategy we followed to try to build all these devices.
As you can see, we wanted to assembly a lot of parts, too many devices for our first time. This is why we had to focus in some devices and to forget assembling others. You will see a yellow star in the upper left corner of the prioritized devices. These are the devices we finally assembled.
Device 1. Type: protein generator
Notes: This device includes all Prh system proteins we synthesized by using Mr. Gene services. Finally it was not built.
Device 2. Type: protein generator
Notes: This device includes all Fec system proteins we wanted to synthesize by PCR and SDM methods. We decided not to build this divice due to the fact that it already exists in E. coli K12 strain.
Device 3. Type: protein generator
Notes: This device was created to perform an hybrid Fec/Prh system. Instead of it we built Device 17 which also allows to use Circuit 3 and it is easier to build.
Device 4. Type: protein generator
Notes: We were not confident of Circuit 4 function and we had not time to lose. This means that we did not assembly required parts for Device 4.
Device 5. Type: reporter
Notes: We focused in Circuit 3, which uses PfecA promoter, so we did not continue building any device with PprhJ promoter; although we synthesized PprhJ promoter by using Mr. Gene services.
Device 6. Type: reporter
Notes: PRIORITIZED DEVICE! In our final project this device is required to measure the induction of PfecA promoter by using signal transduction Circuit 3.
Device 7. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: We focused in Circuit 3, which uses PfecA promoter, so we did not continue building any device with PprhJ promoter; although we synthesized PprhJ promoter by using Mr. Gene services.
Device 8. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: PRIORITIZED DEVICE! Because aspartate is a great attractant for E. coli, this is our main device to attract bacterial population which could not interact directly with the target to the non-difussible target.
Device 9. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: This was not a prioritized device but we built it at the same time that we decided which were the prioritized ones. Anyway, we could make a comparison between chemoattractant production in Device 8 and 9.
Device 10. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: Finally we chose aspartate like the best attractant for E. coli. This is why Glutamate Synthase devices were not going to continue building. Furthermore, we focused in Circuit 3, which uses PfecA promoter, so we did not continue building any device with PprhJ promoter; although we synthesized PprhJ promoter by using Mr. Gene services.
Device 11. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: Finally we chose aspartate like the best attractant for E. coli. This is why Glutamate Synthase devices were not going to continue building.
Device 12. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: Finally we chose aspartate like the best attractant for E. coli. This is why Glutamate Synthase devices were not going to continue building.
Device 13. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: We focused in Circuit 3, which uses PfecA promoter, so we did not continue building any device with PprhJ promoter; although we synthesized PprhJ promoter by using Mr. Gene services.
Device 14. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: PRIORITIZED DEVICE! This is our the main device to attract bacterial population of P. putida to the non-difussible target with which E. coli, harboring Device 17, interacted.
Device 15. Type: Protein generator/Signal sender
Notes: This device was finally not built.
Device 16. Type: Constitutive protein generator/reporter
Notes: You can call it device or biobrick, but it continues being such a usefull part.
Device 17. Type: Protein generator
Notes: PRIORITIZED DEVICE! This device replaces Device 3. We hoped that enough amount of the other components of Circuit 3 were invested by bacteria. In our final project this was our only support to transduce the outside non-diffusible target presence to the inner of bacterial cells. We tried to assemble this device but it seemed that this OM protein had a harmful effect over bacterial survival and there was not colonies able to grow with Device 17.
