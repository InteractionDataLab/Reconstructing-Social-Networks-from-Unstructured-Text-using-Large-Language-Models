September, 13th
Assembly Team
We set up inocula of (1+2) and (16+3).
Assay Team
Eventually the assay was an unqualified failure and we didn’t achieve any positive result. We should study why it has happened and change some things to adjust properly the assay.
The results are still wrong. We suspect our K12 strains’ motility so we prepared an assay in soft agar to demonstrate it.
