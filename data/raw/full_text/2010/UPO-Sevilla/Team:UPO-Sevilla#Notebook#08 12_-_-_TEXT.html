August, 12th
Assembly Team
We made plasmid minipreps and analytic digestions with EcoRI and PstI by using inocula that we set up the day before. Digestion analysis was not conclusive since agarose gel ran out bad and we could not analyze it well. We were going to make analytic cuts by using restriction enzyme target which allowed us to distinguish the different devices.
Minipreps and analytic digestions of UPO 5 & UPO11 have been confirmed.
