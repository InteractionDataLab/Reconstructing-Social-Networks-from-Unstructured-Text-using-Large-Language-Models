September, 8th
Production Team
We performed the second overlapping PCR reaction of the SDM with the former and purified PCR products. We carried out two strategies: in one PCR reaction we used the original concentration and in another we used a 1/10 dilution of it.
Products of these PCR reactions were analyzed in 0,8% gel electrophoresis and it was shown that there were not amplification.
Assembly Team
Transformation of E. coli DH5-alfa with the products of ligations, and we spread in selective plates.
Assay Team
We carried out the assay without any problem but we must wait to see the results. We have to incubate the plates overnight.
