September, 24th
Assay Team
We performed the assay proposed the day before. The chemotaxis chamber was incubated at 30ºC during one hour. Then we spread dilutions of the needles content in LB + Cm plates. We used that antibiotic to avoid contamination since P. putida KT2442 can resist chloranphenicol antibiotic.
