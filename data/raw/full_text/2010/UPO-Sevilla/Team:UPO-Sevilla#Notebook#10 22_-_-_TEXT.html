October, 22nd
Assay Team
Chemotaxis assay: we sterilized flow-chambers and prepared an Adler's chamber; we also prepared capillaries with aspartate and TQ, and carried out the experiment in the same way that the time before, but now  in flow-chambers.
We put 200ul of cellular suspension in Adler's chamber and we observed by microscopy every 15 minutes, from 0' to 60'. There were more bacteria in aspartate capillaries.
