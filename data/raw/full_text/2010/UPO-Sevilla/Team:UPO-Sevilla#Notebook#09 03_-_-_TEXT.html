September, 3rd
We had the opportunity to show our project to John S. Parkinson before a seminar he gave in Sevilla. Thanks his ideas we were nearer of successful chemotaxis assays.
Besides he confirmed our expectation that glutamate is a worse attractant than aspartate for E. coli. Furthermore he told us that E. coli is able to exudates aspartate. A lot of useful information.
