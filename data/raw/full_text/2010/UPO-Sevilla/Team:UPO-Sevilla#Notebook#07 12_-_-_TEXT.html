July, 12th
First we were organized the work in teams. The WetLab team is finally divided in Production and Assembly team, while our previous teams are still active: Sensing group (David Caballero and Eva Fernández) and Chemotaxis-Adhesion team (Adrián Arellano, Paola Gallardo and Félix Reyes).  Next we designed the DNA primers to perform SDM by overlap extension PCR.
