September, 20th
Assay Team
We designed and prepared material to performance an assay to show Pseudomonas sp. G7 was chemotactic to salicylate. We tested two kind of needles (more or less thin) and three different concentrations of salicylate: 1mM, 10mM and 100mM. In each chemotaxis cubicle there were two needles: one with salicylate (S) and another with buffer, the control (C). This is a representation of the assay:
