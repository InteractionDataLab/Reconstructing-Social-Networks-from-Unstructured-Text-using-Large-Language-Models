Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

Understand our RNA devices
On this page we show how we analyzed and estimated the switching process of our RNA devices. This is a basic requirement for the creation of better RNA devices.

Our contribution to the registry
Our project required the analysis and modification of existing Biobricks from the part registry as well as the creation of new Biobricks. This page contains more information about these steps.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Patronage and Acknowledgement
We thank Prof. Herrmann for supporting us and his "Schirmherrschaft" over our project. This does not only make us feel like we are really representing the Technical University Munich but also equips us with the hope that we did not only start an iGEM team at the TUM, but also that younger students will proceed our work and also participate at te next iGEM competition. Thank you very much for the appreciation of our work and effort!
We would also really like to thank all people working in Prof. Simmel's group, E14 in the chemistry/physics department/ZNN. A lot of our work would not have been possible without your help and support. Thanks for providing us your technical equipement and for offering us working space, virtual space and a coffee machine. We also thank the whole Simmel group for nice conversations in between measurements, patience, help and for just accepting us in their group!
We also like to thank Prof. Simmel himself for his personal effort, there are not many professors around who pay the registration fee from their private money without knowing if they will ever get it back... (don't worry, he got it back in the end). And of course for the initiation to start an iGEM team at the TU Munich and finally adding some of the TUM's glamour to iGEM ;)
In Prof. Simmels group there are more people we would like to thank in person. Especially Helene Budjarek for her endless patience in the lab, showing us everything, introducing us to everything, caring for everything...
Maximilian Weitz and Korbinian Kapsner for their help with in vitro transcription and PAGE, for supplying us with enzymes if we run out of them again and for nice company during measurements.
Ralf Jungmann for organizing an internal wiki and for responding to emails even on weekends and also for being a very nice person in general.
Andreas Müller and Stephan Renner for being such nice roommates in the ZNN.
Special thanks also to Erika Bischofs for organizing everything for us and Dagmar Meier for managing our bank account.
Furthermore we would like to thank the E22 group who also helped us a lot by sharing their instruments and lab space with us. Our gratitude especially goes to PD Dr. Woehlke , where all our S1 work took place as well as the in vivo measurements.  Sorry, we blew an Erlenmeyer flask in your shaker...
...and Prof. Dietz who provided excellent help all the time, no matter if we asked for supply or help with our simulations or crititical feedback concerning our project itself. Thank you very much for the willingness to help us and the support which can not be taken for granted.
We would also like to thank our former advisor Christoph Klingner, who left us (and the Simmel group) in spring. Christoph, you're missing the trip to boston...
We would also like to thank Melissa Poynor from Prof. Groll's chair for our cutest little mascot, the one and only E. coli. Thank you very much also for many agarose plates, cloning into pSB1C3 would have been a lot harder without!
Furthermore we would like to thank Andra Jebelean, a student at the University of Erlangen in Padagogy for translating our abstract into Rumanian and French and for proof-reading our flyers if they fit for non-biochemists. Thank you so much for your effort! Our gratitude to Carina Mann, Rudi Wachtel, fellow Biochemists at the TU Munich, Manuel Martinortiz, Elena Formato, Daniela Korthöwer, Ala El Din Samara and Kristine Steen Jensen for helping us translating our abstract.
Supporters and Sponsors
Supporters within the TU Munich
We thank the Fachschaftenrat der TU München and Asta for supporting us in the name of the students of the TU Munich. We really appreciate you for trusting us with your StudiTUM money and the support from different departments and disciplines which is implicated here. Thank you very much!
We thank TUM International for supporting us by paying our flights to the Jamboree! We are really grateful for your immense support which really made the day of nine lab students and relieved us from our biggest fears. We also really appreciate the support by the TUM presidency who granted the money.
Supporting Organizations
We thank the DAAD , Germany Academic Exchange Service for supporting us from their international competition fund.
We thank the NIM (nano-initiative-munich) for supporting us from their fund.
Industrial Partners
We thank Eurofins MWG Operon for financial help. We really appreciate the effort you had in getting us an extra budget and are happy to get support from the industry. Thank you very much!
We thank Biomers for discount on their sequences. We needed a lot of them and delivery was always fast, talking with you about orders was always nice and quality and amount of DNA were excellent! Thank you very much!
Like many other iGEM Teams we would like to thank Mr. Gene for their discount! Thank you very much for the good price!
We would also like to thank New England Biolabs for offering a good price on their enzymes. We really loved working with them, cutting and ligating was not really fun but much easier! Thanks a lot for nice phone calls and a positive attitude towards our work with iGEM!
Press
First article and already headline! For all of you, who speak German, check out the interview Andreas Hubel conducted with us. Well, the main idea seems to be that our bacterias will lead the world one day, so beware of the iGEM Team TU Munich!
An interview of biotechnologie.tv with our teammember Christoph. biotechnologie.tv is an initiatve of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. You can find the interview on youtube or have a look at further information about biotechnologie.tv on their website .
Collaboration
Say Hello to the LMU Munich, our dearest and closest collaboration partner! Despite the joke, that they are the Lower Munich University, we were happy to have another iGEM team nearby. Check our their amazing wiki and admire the beauty of Munich at night! We did not contribute something as trivial as help in the lab to each other but something as substantial as moral support, somebody to talk and understand and a lot of motivation!
