Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
