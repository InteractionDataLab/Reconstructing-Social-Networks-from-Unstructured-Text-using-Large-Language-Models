Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

Understand our RNA devices
On this page we show how we analyzed and estimated the switching process of our RNA devices. This is a basic requirement for the creation of better RNA devices.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
During the the last year your team not only thought about BioBricks and how to connect them. We also wanted to contribute to the iGEM community. To find more, take a look at the following sections. It will be worth it!
Wiki tutorial
You are new to iGEM or are not familiar with creating a your own Wiki? We wrote a tutorial explaining both, how to create a wiki at the first place but also how to use without knowing all this computer stuff. This page make it easier for you to get started!
Safety and thoughts on synthetic biology
The field of biotechnology is often linked to  controversial discussions. But what are the real risks and chances of biotechnology? Here, we discuss different ethical aspects about synthetic biology and our project in particular.
Collaborations
Munich is among a few cities that will have two participating iGEM teams. Of course we had to meet! Our meeting with the LMU Munich team gave us the chance to get to know each other and discuss your projects. Thank you LMU munich for this nice occasion!
Safety beyond the usual
Working with E. coli offers some surprises and unthought error sources. Check here for a smile :)
Attribution and Contributions
Christoph Klinger, who was part of the iGEM team until spring 2010 provided glycerol stock of cells transformed with BBa_J06702. All other work was done excusively by members of the TUM iGEM Team 2010.
