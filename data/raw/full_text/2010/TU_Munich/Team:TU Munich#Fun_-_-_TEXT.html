Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

Understand our RNA devices
On this page we show how we analyzed and estimated the switching process of our RNA devices. This is a basic requirement for the creation of better RNA devices.

Our contribution to the registry
Our project required the analysis and modification of existing Biobricks from the part registry as well as the creation of new Biobricks. This page contains more information about these steps.

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Don't take your E. coli everywhere - they might smell bad.
Don't put your E. coli on your sophisticated laser apparatus - you might regret it and it might smell bad.
Don't put your E. coli to close to your Millipore ion exchanger - the water quality might suffer.
Don't vortex your E. coli cells too hard - they might puke and this is not nice...
Don't spill your E. coli cells everwhere - keep your stuff clean!
If you put your E. coli cells into a fluorimeter and try to repeat our in vivo measurements and then wonder why they don't work - well may be crossed the OD600 of 0.05.
If you don't understand why you only measure noise and ask your E. coli - most likely it won't tell you anything new...
Colony PCR!
Again, don't spill everywhere.
In the end of the day, enjoy your beer. Don't let E. coli get into your way...
The E. coli cell in use was a kind gift of Melissa Poynor from the Biochemistry Department of the TU Munich, who took a pity in poor Biochemists being deplaced into the world of Biophysics. The cell itself was grown by RIESENmikroben TM . No E. coli cells were harmed during the shooting of these photos. Some were harmed during our labwork...
