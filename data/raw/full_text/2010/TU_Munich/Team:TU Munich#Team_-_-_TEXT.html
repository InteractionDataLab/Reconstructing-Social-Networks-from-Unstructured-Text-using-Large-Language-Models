Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
We are the proud representatives of the Technical University Munich. Our small team consists of a mixture of biochemists, biotechnologists, mathematicians and physicists. As a interdisciplinary group, we were able to combine many aspects in our project. Please note that we are the first real group of the TU Munich which participates at the iGEm for real (if you ignore the brief affair in 2008), so we are still beginners... You can get more information about us if you move your cursor over each of the boxes below. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us:
