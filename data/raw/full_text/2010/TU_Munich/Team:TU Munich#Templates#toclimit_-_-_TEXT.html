Usage
This template inserts a Table of Contents which omits subheadings lower than a certain level. The table obeys the same layout rules as the __TOC__ magic word. You can specify the limit with the limit parameter; for instance, limit=3 allows ===subheadings=== but omits any subheadings below that from the TOC (they still have section edit links, however; the main use for this template is situations where you want section edit links for ease of editing but don't want to clutter the table of contents).
{{toclimit|limit=}}
This is the textvar "{{{testvar}}}"! The testvar is {{#if: {{{1}}} | empty | not empty }}
