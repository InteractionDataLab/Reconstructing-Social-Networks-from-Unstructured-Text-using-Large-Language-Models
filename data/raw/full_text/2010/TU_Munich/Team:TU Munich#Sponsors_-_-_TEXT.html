Build your own network
To demonstrate our vision about Biobrick networks, we developed a software, that enables you to interconnect Biobricks of your choice to your personal network. It will generate a DNA sequence that encodes all your logical connections. Just give it a try!

iGEM is more than biology
The iGEM competition not only aims to drive the development of new Biobricks. It also encourages to think about responsibilities, safety and risks in the field of biotechnology. Furthermore, iGEM is about working together and helping other teams in various aspects. Read more how we want to contribute to these goals.
Sponsors related to TU Munich
We thank the Fachschaftenrat der TU München and Asta for supporting us in the name of the students of the TU Munich. We really appreciate you for trusting us with your StudiTUM money and the support from different departments and disciplines which is implicated here. Thank you very much!
We thank TUM International for supporting us by paying our flights to the Jamboree! We are really grateful for your immense support which really made the day of nine lab students and relieved us from our biggest fears. We also really appreciate the support by the TUM presidency who granted the money.
Support Organizations
We thank the DAAD , Germany Academic Exchange Service for supporting us from their international competition fund.
Industry
We thank Eurofins MWG Operon for financial help. We really appreciate the effort you had in getting us an extra budget and are happy to get support from the industry. Thank you very much!
Lab sponsors
We thank Biomers for discount on their sequences. We needed a lot of them and delivery was always fast, talking with you about orders was always nice and quality and amount of DNA were excellent! Thank you very much!
Like many other iGEM Teams we would like to thank Mr. Gene for their discount! Thank you very much for the good price!
We would also like to thank New England Biolabs for offering a good price on their enzymes. We really loved working with them, cutting and ligating was not really fun but much easier! Thanks a lot for nice phone calls and a positive attitude towards our work with iGEM!
