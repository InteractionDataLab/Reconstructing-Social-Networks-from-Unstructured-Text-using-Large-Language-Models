Who we are
Advisors:
Assoc. Prof Ashley Buckle currently is running a lab in the Monash STRIP under the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with research aimed at understanding how the structure and dynamics of proteins dictates their function. More information can be found at Buckle Lab
Dr. Andrew Perry is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Whisstock lab, with research focusing on outer membrane pore forming proteins in mitochondria and bacteria. Structural biology and bioinformatics, protein structure by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and X-ray crystallography.
Dr. Lloyd Low is a Postdoctoral researcher in Peter Boag's lab in the the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Monash University. He is a former member of the Melbourne University iGEM team, and helped get us started at Monash.
Students:
Ben is currently a second year Bachelor of Science student, Majoring in Biochemistry and molecular biology with a minor in Microbiology.  Ben aspires to open up his own research and development company after graduating.
Will is a final year Bachelor of science student, with majors in 'Biochemistry' and 'Immnology and Human Pathology'. Will is currently seeking honours placement for 2011, and strives to earn a PhD scholarship.
Anna is in her final year studying a Bachelor of Science with majors in Biochemistry and Physiology. She intends to further her studies by continuing with honours and pursuing a PhD.
Daniel is a first year bachelor of Biomedical science student and on completion of his degree will be a biochemistry or molecuar biology major. Daniel will further his studies with a honours and eventually a PhD, and wishes to travel the world working for various laboratories as a Post doctoral research fellow.
Ricky is a third year Bachelor of Science student majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular biology, and as of the beginning of 2010, also a first year engineering student looking at majoring in Chemical engineering. Upon graduation, with his knowledge of Biochemistry and Molecular biology and specialisation in Chemical engineering he wishes to find a niche between the two disciplines; participating in the igem competition is a great stepping stone.
What we did
For team Monash Australia we are currently balancing iGEM work with semester one and two of university, with the Jamboree around out end of year examinations. Due to this we have equally divided all work between us to help us juggle university study and iGEM project. Much of the iGEM project would have not been possible if it was not for the drive, energy and passion that both Ben and Andrew have given, Thanks guys.
