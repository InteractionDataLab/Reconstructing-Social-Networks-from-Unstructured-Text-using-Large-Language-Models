E. Coli Transformation
Materials
You will need:
DH5α competent cells
polypropylene tubes
ice
DNA to be transformed; can consist of ligation product , miniprep sample , or stock parts from the registry
luria broth
nutrient agar plates
Sterilized glass beads
Extra Notes
Do not keep cells out for too long. It is vital that the cells undergo a rapid temperature change (from very cold to very hot suddenly) in order for crack pores in the cell wall.
Procedure
Thaw DH5α cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Transfer 50μL of DH5α cells to chill, sterile polypropylene tubes.
Transfer 1μL of DNA into the tubes with the cells.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Gently transfer tubes to 42°C water bath for 90s (for heat shock)
Transfer tubes back on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 800μL of luria broth into each tube.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour in a shaker.
Plate 200μL of each sample on nutrient agar plates. (Be sure to choose the plates with the antibiotic that your E. Coli is resistant to.)
Spread the sample evenly by plating with sterilized glass beads. Empty the plate of glass beads afterwards.
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
Purpose
To insert plasmids into E. Coli.
