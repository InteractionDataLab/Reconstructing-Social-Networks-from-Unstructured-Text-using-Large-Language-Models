Creating Each Individual Composite Part

Genetic Circuit Pieces
Next Mission: Placing them into only two plasmids
Final Mission: Create an Even Lawn of E. Coli
We are using this top agar plating technique
Next is to test the what the optimal OD, arabinose concentration, and amount of light it takes to a) create an even lawn of E. Coli and b) see contrast between the "on" and "off" cells
Basic Assembly Protocols
For more insight about the process behind the ligations, here is a sample ligation procedure.  Because the initiator is one of the smaller constructs, we have decided to use it as an example to illustrate the protocols used in lab.
Starting Up
Hydrated parts: BBa_B0034, BBa_C0051, BBa_B0015, BBa_R0082.
Transformed these parts into DH5α competent cells.
RBS to BBa_C0051
Cultured cells that have parts: BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Miniprepped BBa_B0034 and BBa_C0051
Digest with SpeI & Pst
Run on gel
Gel extract
Digest with Xba & Pst
Separate fragments through gel electrophoresis
Gel extract
Ligate the RBS and BBa_C0051 fragments together and transform on carb plates.
Depending on the outcome of visible colonies on the experimental and control plates, a PCR screening may be needed.
Assembly notes
It is most practical to cut RBS as a vector because RBS is less than 100 bp long as an insert, making it hard to see and extract on the gel.
The sticky ends from the XbaI and SpeI, when ligated together, will form an 8 bp scar.  Thus, XbaI and SpeI will no longer be able to cut here.
'RBS & BBa_C0051' to Terminator
Cultured cells that have parts: 'RBS & BBa_C0051', BBa_B0015
Miniprepped 'RBS & BBa_C0051' and BBa_B0015
Digest with EcoRI & XbaI
Run on gel
Gel extract
Digest with EcoRI & SpeI
Separate fragments through gel electrophoresis
Gel extract
Ligate the fragments together and transform on kan plates.
Depending on the outcome of visible colonies on the experimental and control plates, a PCR screening may be needed.
Assembly notes
It is most practical to cut BBa_B0015 as the vector because it is only 130 bp long.  It would be hard to see on a gel.
'RBS & BBa_C0051 & stop' to BBa_R0082
Cultured cells that have parts: 'RBS & BBa_C0051 & stop', BBa_R0082
Miniprepped 'RBS & BBa_C0051& stop' and BBa_R0082
Digest with SpeI & PstI
Run on gel
Gel extract
Digest with XbaI & PstI
Separate fragments through gel electrophoresis
Gel extract
Ligate the fragments together and transform on carb plates.
Depending on the outcome of visible colonies on the experimental and control plates, a PCR screening may be needed.
Assembly notes
The promoter had to be cut as a vector because it is only 108 bp by itself.
