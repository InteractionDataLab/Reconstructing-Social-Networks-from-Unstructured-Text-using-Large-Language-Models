PCR screening
Materials
You will need:
10X Buffer
Q solution
Forward primer
Reverse primer
dNTP
TAQ Polymerase
Sterile milliQ water
Extra Notes
None.
Procedure
Making the Cocktail
Make a little more cocktail than is actually required to account for pipetting accuracy. Eg. if 10 reactions are to be done, multiply the volume of each ingredient by 10.5.  The following table indicates how much cocktail is needed for 1 rxn.

In each PCR tube that you plan to perform a PCR reaction in, put 10μL of sterile milliQ water, pluck your desired colony with a 20μL pipette tip (using 2x microscope if necessary) and place tip in PCR tube. (If you are using a DNA sample in solution as your template, than alter volume of water in PCR tube; eg. add 2μL template DNA to 8μL milliQ water in PCR tube.)
Add 10μL/40μL depending in reaction volume) to respective PCR tube.
Spin down PCR tubes in picocentrifuge.
