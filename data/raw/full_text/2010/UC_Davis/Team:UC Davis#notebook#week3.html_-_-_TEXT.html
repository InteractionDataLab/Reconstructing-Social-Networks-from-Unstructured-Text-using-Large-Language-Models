From 2010.igem.org
Week 3: 6/27/10 through 7/3/10
Our project and design workplan has now been finalized!
We are proud to present our main project, a genetic circuit which will enable a lawn of E. Coli to produce a spatial oscillating pattern (stripes) upon the initial stimulation of light to propagate the signaling cascade across the lawn.
This project will build upon creating composite parts made from existing parts of the registry.
Thus, we hydrated, transformed, cultured, and miniprepped the following parts: C0078, C0079, I12006, K274002, I14015, I13453, I15008, I15009, I15010, R0082, J23119, E1010
Light Sensor
Assembly workplan for light sensor is made:
Assembling Part A: I13453 cut with Eco & Spe, RBS cut with Eco& Xba, I15009 cut with Xba & Pst, '1&2' cut with Spe & Pst
Assembling Part B: RBS w/ Spe & Pst, I15009 w/ Xba & Pst
Assembling Part C: RBS cut with Eco & Xba, J23119 cut w/ Eco & Spe
** Began assembling parts A&B
Initiator and Las Receiver
Workplan for light receiver made: R0082-RBS-C0051-B0015
Assembling RBS-C0051: RBS w/ Spe & Pst, C0051 w/ Xba & Pst
Assembling RBS-C0051-B0015: RBS-C0051 w/ Eco & Spe, B0015 w/ Eco & Xba
Assembling RBS-C0051-B0015 with R0082: RBS-C0051-B0015 w/ Xba & Pst, R0082 w/ Spe & Pst
Assembling RBS-C0051-B0015 with I14015: RBS-C0051-B0015 w/ Xba & Pst, R0082 w/ Spe & Pst
We must first make stocks of RBS-C0051 because it is used in multiple parts RBS-C0051 will be used in creating the construct that will test/validate the initiator, the actual intiator, and the ON switch.  Thus, there will be some slight collaboration in creating this part.
ON switch
Making: I12006-B0034-C0051-B0034-E10100-F1610
Digested and purified: B0034, C0051, I12006
Made competent cells of E. Coli Strain CP919
