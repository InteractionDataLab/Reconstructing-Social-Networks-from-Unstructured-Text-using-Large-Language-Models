Week 8: 8/1/10 through 8/7/10
Light sensor: light sensor may have been completed, as Parts A&B&C may have been ligated together.  However, we found that the complete part may be questionable, as when we digested them, we find that they are not the right lengths.
ON switch progress: All colonies turned red. .  Spooky transcription returs.  Will continue w/ part regardless.  Also, begin next portion:
I12006-B0034-C0051-B0034-E1010-F1610
I12006 will be cut with Spe & Pst; B0034-C0051-B0034-E1010-F1610 (also known as K327001) will be cut with Xba & pst
OFF switch
Starting off with new digestions, attempting with the fast digest procedure
