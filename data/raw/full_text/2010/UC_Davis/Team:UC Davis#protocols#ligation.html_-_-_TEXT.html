Ligation
Materials
You will need:
Purified vector (plasmid) DNA sample
Purified insert DNA sample
Ligation buffer
DNA ligase
MilliQ water
Extra Notes
Use of a microsoft excel sheet is highly recommended for easy calculations.
It is recommended that in addition to an experimental ligation, that you have a vector and insert controls.
This is a quick ligation protocol. It is highly recommended that transformations are done simultaneously. In 20 minutes (after the addition of ligase), the ligation is ready.  This means competent cells should be taken out in 10 minutes after ligase is added so that ligase and cells are ready at the same time.
Procedure
Determining how much vector, insert, and milliQ water should be used
Measure concentrations of the purified vector and insert samples to be used via nanodrop, spectrophotometer, etc.
The vector volume = [desired vector mass (ng)]/[vector concentration]
The insert volume = [(desired vector mass (ng))/(vector length)]*[(insert length)/(insert concentration)]*[desired insert:vector ratio]
milliQ water will be used as a filler to ensure that the end reaction volume is 20μL.  This means milliQ volume = 20μL - 2μL (from DNA ligase buffer) - 1μL (from DNA ligase) - vector volume - insert volume.
Ligation (Experimental)
Add previously calculated amount of vector.
Add previously calculated amount of insert.
Add 2μL DNA ligation buffer.
Add 1μL DNA ligase.
Add previously calculated milliQ water.
Controls
Add previously calculated amount of vector OR insert
Add 2μL DNA ligation buffer.
Add 1μL DNA ligase.
Fill total reaction volume to 20μL with milliQ water.
Purpose
To ligate the desired insert fragment to the desired plasmid together.
