Overall Workplan: The Approach in Designing the Circuit
Our Circuit
In building a spatial oscillator, the genetic circuit must fulfill at least 3 main properties.
1. Cells must be able to react to stimuli to start the oscillation.
Our circuit is induced with the absence of light (as indicated by the moon symbol) and arabinose (as indicated by the red molecules.) The light sensor allows the cell to detect the external stimuli, and sends a signal to the light-sensitive promoter to initiate the signal cascade to propagate the spatial oscillation.
2. Cells must be able to transform into one of two states.
In our circuit, all promoter have dual functions.  They are activated or inhibited by specific molecules. For example, the ON promoter is lambda-activated, but inhibited by the "434" protein. Likewise, the OFF switch is lux-activated, but inhibited by the lambda protein.
3. Cellular expression must be robust to external environmental perturbations.
In our circuit, robustness is achieved through the use of positive feedback. For example, in the ON switch, once the lambda protein activates the ON promoter, it continuously upregulate its own production to keep the promoter ON. Simultaneously, this reinforces the inhibition of the OFF promoter as well.
