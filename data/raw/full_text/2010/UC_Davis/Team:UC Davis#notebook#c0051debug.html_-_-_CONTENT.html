We tried a number of on-line tools for automated promoter detection but did not come up with any meaningful results.  Next we contacted Drew Endy at Stanford to tap into his knowledgebase of phage biology.  He forwarded this request to Thomas Schneider at the NIH who used the Delia programs to search for sigma70 binding sites.  Surprisingly, a few potential &quot;good&quot; scoring candidates were found.  Armed with this data, we decided to see if we could experimentally confirm one of these sites as a potential transcript start site using the technique called 5'-RACE.  Initial results follow.</LI></UL><TABLE border="1" margin="0" width="510px" padding:0="" margin:0=""><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size="1">Figure: Putative sigma 70 promoters detected by Thomas Schneider using Delia programs.

(1) C0051-PSP (C0051 in a promoter screening plasmid - red cells), (2) E1010-PSP (RFP in promoter screening plasmid - white cells) and (3) DH5alpha cells.  Using RFP specific primers, we were unable to generate any cDNA from either constructs 2 or 3 - our negative controls.  We were able to retrieve transcript from the C0051-PSP strain indicating that RFP was indeed transcribed.  When we sequenced the resulting cDNA (see figure below) we noticed that the poly-A tail (added during sample prep for amplification) was located just upstream of the scar between the barcode and the ribosome binding site (Bba_B0034).  Therefore, our initial 5'-RACE experiment indicates that the transcript likely initiates within the bar code region rather than within the cI coding region.  A second sample/clone verified this result</LI></UL></TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT size="1">Figure legend: Sequencing chromatogram of 5'-RACE experiment. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><UL><LI>As shown, the transcription that we are seeing clearly starts at the beginning of the barcode region</LI></UL></P><P class="header"><B>Test #4</B></P><P><TABLE border="0" margin="0" width="600px" padding:0="" margin:0=""><TBODY><TR><TD><FONT size="1">Modified C0051 in PSP exhibited white phenotype.

We would like to eventually try other coding regions upstream.</LI><LI>The <B>5'-RACE experiment seems to suggest that the transcript start site is within the bar code</B>.  This is further supported by the experiment in which the bar code is removed and the cells no longer produce RFP.  We are also repeating this experiment several more times to verify the result.</LI><LI>The combination of results 2 and 3 suggest that there is some functional coordination between sequence in cI and the bar code that is ultimately responsible for promoter activity.  We are testing this hypothesis by generating various truncations of cI that retain the bar code and LVA tag.  This should allow us to &quot;zoom in&quot; on the sequence in Bba_C0051 that is responsible for this phenomenon.    <B>We expect to have this data for our presentation - please see our talk</B>.</LI><LI>In addition to data from the previous point, we also intend to have <B>some measure of relative promoter strength in time to present.  Again, please see our talk</B>.

While we don't completely understand the mechanism of this promoter, <B>we have made great strides to characterize this critical registry part and contributed a &quot;corrected&quot; promoter-free version of the part in the registry (<A href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K327018">BBa_K327018</A>).  Given the broad use of this part we expect this to have a relatively large impact</B>.  

Finally, a critical extension of this result is the conclusion that we must be prepared to accept the idea that the assembly of even well-standardized parts may be subject to unintended consequences that arise from the nature of the substrate we're working with (DNA).  That is, while we might understand the isolated function of each part, specific combination of these parts may invent novel function that were unexpected - the assembly of a device may lead to functions that are more than the sum of its parts.</LI></UL><P class="header"><B>More to Come!</B></P><P><TABLE border="0" margin="0" width="600px" padding:0="" margin:0=""><TBODY><TR><TD><UL><LI>We are currently working to clearly pinpoint the place in the cI-lambda coding region that interacts with the barcode and caused transcription. </LI><LI>In order to achieve this, we have designed primers, which are used to carefully truncate Bba_C0051.
