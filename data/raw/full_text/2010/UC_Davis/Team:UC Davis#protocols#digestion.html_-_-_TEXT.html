Digestion
Materials
You will need:
Sterilized milliQ water
BSA
NEB buffers 1,2,3,and/or 4 (see extra notes)
Miniprepped sample or plasmid you wish to cut
NEB digestion enzymes (EcoRI, SpeI, PstI, NheI, and/or XbaI)
Extra Notes
Be sure to use the buffer that maximizes the compatibility and activity between the two enzymes. The numbers indicate the percentage of enzyme activity for each enzyme in each buffer.

Procedure
1. Add the following into a PCR tube
22μL of milliQ water
1μL BSA
5μL buffer x (see extra notes)
20μL template to be cut
1μL digestion enzyme 1
1μL digestion enzyme 2
2. Run in a thermocycler
37°C for 3 hours
80°C for 20 minutes
Keep at 4°C if to be stored
Purpose
To cut DNA at the designated places; cut out the insert from the plasmid.
