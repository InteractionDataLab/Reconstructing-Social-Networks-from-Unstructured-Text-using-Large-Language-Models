ON pathway
Construct:
Step One
B0034 is ligated to both C0051 and E1010 (also known as RFP)
Step Two
RBS-RFP and F1610 are ligated together
Step Three
RBS-C0051 and RBS-RFP-F1610 are ligated together
This step is where we have discovered bizarre transcription!!!
Step Four
AFTER getting rid of the C0051 bar code, we have ligated the MODIFIED c0051 to the RBS-RFP-F1610.
Step Five
After ligating the piece to the I12006 promoter, we have now completed the ON switch!
