From 2010.igem.org
Week 4: 7/4/10 through 7/10/10
Many workplans were revised
For the light sensor, the RBS was extracted successfully from the gel; but promoters did not show A new workplan for the light sensor because extracting promoters of 35bp & 130bp will not be a good idea, thus, we present to you: Light Sensor Take Two
For the ON switch: (picture will be put up soon)
|I12006(SP)-[B0034(SP)-C0051(XP)](XP)|(EX)-|[B0034(SP)-E1010(XP)](SP)-F1610(XP)|(EX)
For the initiator test construct, RBS-RFP will now be embedded in between the actual construct.  To illustrate:
Actual construct: R0082-RBS-C0051-B0015
Test construct: R0082-RBS-RFP-RBS-C0051-B0015
Many, if not all ligations were unsuccessful: parts were not cutting successfully since bands in the gel were not showing up in the right places.
