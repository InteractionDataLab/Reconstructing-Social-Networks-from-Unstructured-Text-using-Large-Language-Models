Miniprep
Materials
You will need:
Fermentas GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit
Ethanol (for first use)
Microcentrifuge tubes
Extra Notes
Buffer preparation
Add provided RNase A solution to the resuspension solution.  Afterwards, it can be used for 6 months, but must be stored at 4°C.
Add 96%-100% ethanol to wash solution prior to first use.
Purification
All purification steps are to be done at room temperature
All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at >12000x g (10,000-14,000 rpm depending on rotor type.)
For more (and detailed) notes and protocol, see pg. 3 in Fermentas protocol booklet
Procedure
Extracting DNA from cells
Take out previously cultured cells
Separate cells from luria broth by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes
Empty out the luria broth completely.
Add 250μL of the resuspension solution, vortex, then transfer cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250μL lysis solution and invert the tube 4-6.
Add 350μL neutralization solution and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Centrifuge for 5 minutes.
Binding DNA
Transfer supernatant to spin column.
Centrifuge for 1 minute.
Discard flowthrough
Washing Column of Residues
Add 500μL wash solution and centrifuge for 30~60 seconds. Discard flowthrough, place column back into same collection tube.
Repeat above step with another 500μL wash solution
Centrifuge empty column 1 minute to remove residual wash solution.
Eluting DNA
Transfer spin column to fresh 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50μL elution buffer to center of spin column.  Incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifuge for 2 minutes.
Keep the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C
Purpose
To purify the plasmid DNA from the cells.
