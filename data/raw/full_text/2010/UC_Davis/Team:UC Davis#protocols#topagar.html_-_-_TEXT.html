Top Agar
Materials
You will need:
Pre-made nutrient agar plates
Soft Agar
Cultures of desired bacteria to be plated
Antibiotic resistance and other required substances (see extra notes)
Vortex
Polypropylene tubes
Water bath
Extra Notes
For our construct specifically, we also needed to use arabinose, and possibly heme in our top agar solution. (The initiation of our spatial oscillator is controlled by a pBad promoter. To be induced, the promoter needs 0.02% arabinose and possibly heme, in addition to darkness.)
Measure/test the OD of the culture beforehand to know the required amount of bacteria to create a lawn of E. Coli.
Procedure
1. Pre-warm the premade nutrient agar plates.
2. Melt soft agar by microwaving.
3. Aliquot/pipette 2mL into each polypropylene tube.
4. Cool the melted soft agar to 45C. This can be done by placing the polypropylene tubes into a water bath.
5. Creating the solution
Pipette the required substances
Pipette the required amount of bacteria culture
Vortex!
6. Pour soft agar solution onto premade agar plates . For an even lawn, tilt, tilt, tilt! It takes practice.
Purpose
To create an even lawn of E. Coli on a nutrient agar plate.
