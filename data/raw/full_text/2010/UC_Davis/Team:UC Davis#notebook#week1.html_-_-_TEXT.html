Week 3: 6/13/10 through 6/19/10
Summer has officially started!
We have completed a synthetic biology course during our spring quarter.  Now it's time to put that knowledge to use!
We could be in the lab right now, but unfortunately, our speculated project is not plausible.
Thus, our old idea is scratched.  And we must now brainstorm an entirely new one.
Week 1
We would like to take a moment to thank all of our sponsors for their very generous donations, as we could not have done this without your help!
We would also like to thank and acknowledge:
