Gel Electrophoresis
Materials
You will need:
Agarose
1X TAE
Loading Dye
2-log or 100bp Ladder
Safestain
Extra Notes
Be sure that the well size is large enough (but not too large) to accommodate the amount of DNA you will be loading.
Be sure to aware of what concentration your gel is. The difference between a 1% and a 2% agarose gel is significant.
Procedure
Creating a 1% gel stock
Dissolve 5g agarose in 500mL 1X TAE
Creating a 2% gel stock
Dissolve 10g agarose in 500mL 1X TAE
When gel is ready to use
Have gel trays ready with the gel comb (used to create the wells) in place.
Microwave the gel stock. Be sure it is all melted and dissolved.
Pour 50mL into one 50mL centrifuge tube. If gel is bigger, pour 100mL into two 50mL centrifuge tubes.
When gel solution is lukewarm, pipette 5μL safestain into gel
Pour immediately and slowly into gel trays to reduce chunks and bubbles in gel.
Wait until gel completely solidifies.
Loading DNA into gel
Pipette a 1:5 volume of loading dye to DNA template. (Eg. 1μL loading dye into a 5μL DNA template to be loaded.)
Pipette 5μL of ladder into the very first well.
Carefully pipette each DNA template to each well.
Running the gel
Run electric current between 90V-120V through gel until bands have separated enough.
Purpose
Although gel electrophoresis has many purposes, we use them to separate out DNA fragments.  This is done so that we can gel extract wanted DNA parts or simply as a diagnostic to see whether or not we have gotten the right pieces together.
