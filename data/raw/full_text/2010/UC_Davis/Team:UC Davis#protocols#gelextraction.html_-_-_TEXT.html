Gel Extraction
Materials
You will need:
Fermentas GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit
Microcentrifuge tubes
Microtiter pipette & tips
Extra Notes
All steps should be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a microcentrifuge at > 12,000xg (10,000-14,000 rpm, depending on the rotor type)
See Fermentas protocol booklet for more information and detailed instructions.
Procedure
Pre-binding procedure
Cut out gel slice with the desired DNA fragment and weigh gel.
Add 1:1 volume of binding buffer to gel slice. (Eg. 100μL of binding buffer for every 100mg of agarose gel.)
Incubate gel solution at 50°C-60°C for 10 minutes.  Inverting tube helps melting process.
(Optional: only use if DNA fragment is <500bp or >10kb long) If DNA fragment is <500bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol to the solubilized gel solution. Mix thoroughly.  If DNA fragment is >10kb, add a 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution.  Mix thoroughly.
Binding DNA
Transfer (up to 800μL) gel solution to spin column.
Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds. Discard flow-through and place spin column back into same collection tube.
Washing column of residue
Add 700μL of wash buffer and centrifuge for 1 minute.
Discard flow-through and the centrifuge empty column for 1 minute.
Place the column into a fresh 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube.
Eluting DNA
Add 50μL of elution buffer to the column.
Centrifuge for 1 minute.  Keep the flow-through.
Purpose
To purify the DNA from the gel.
