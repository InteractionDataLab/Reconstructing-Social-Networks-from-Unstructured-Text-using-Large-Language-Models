Chia-Chun Gou
Hi. I'm Guo, Chia-Chun. I am always curious about everything, that's  why I often observe surroundings .Especially the phenomenon of biology  fascinated me. As time goes by, I continuously have to get new knowledge,  access to a variety of disciplines. Determine to study biology as for my career  plan.
Luckily, I took a course of gene engineering in university. It gave  me new vision of biology of bacteria. Let me learn more about the biosynthesis.  It makes me very excited, because I am learning about a genetic engineering  skill. We can modified performs of life by altering genes. It is a huge,  magnificent skill. Because it is the God's work!
