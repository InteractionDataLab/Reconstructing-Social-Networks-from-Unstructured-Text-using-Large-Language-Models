Wet Lab>Construction of RBS library
A simple and rapid protocol for generation of  RBS library with different translational activity
Protocol
   This protocol contains six steps:
        1. Construction of standard part to express reporter protein
        2. Mutation position(s) selection
        3. Degenerated primers design
        4. PCR amplification of target plasmid
        5. PCR product ligation and transformation
        6. RBS activity measurement
1. Construction of standard part to express reporter protein.
    The RBS part (B0034) was selected for RBS point mutation to generate RBS library. This RBS is a component of the pSB-I13522, which is composed of a Ptet promoter, a common RBS (B0034), a reporter gene (GFP gene) and dual Terminators .
Fig.  1: The composition of parts of I13522.
      The part pSB_I13522 was inserted into the low copy number backbone pSB3T5 to express GFP protein (Fig. 32).

2. Mutation position(s) selection
    The conserved sequence of RBS is AGGAGAA (Red label in Fig.13). To prevent the disruption of RBS basic functions, we chose the 2 base pair next to the conserved sequence of RBS for point mutation (Blue label in Fig.13).
Fig.  3: The sequence of RBS part BBa_B0034. The conserved sequence is marked in red  and the point mutation sites in are marked in blue.
3. Degenerated primers design
   The primers containing two base pair mutations were designed as follows (Fig.4). The letter N designate sites containing ATCG bases.

4. Using PCR to amplify the target plasmid
    PCR reaction mixture shown in Table 1. Note, it important to use KOD-plus polymerase. Because DNA polymerase from Termococcus kodakaraensis KOD is one of the most efficient, thermostable PCR enzymes exhibiting higher accuracy and elongation velocity in comparison to other available commercial DNA polymerase, we recommend its use.
  PCR condition Table 2
5. PCR product ligation and transformation
    The components of this ligation step are listed in Table 3. When the ligation mixture is prepared, move on to:
        (1) Vortex the tube and spin down in a microcentrifuge for 3-5 seconds.
        (2) Incubate the mixture for 8 hour at 16°C.
        (3) Use the mixture for transformation.
Table  3: The components of the ligation mixture.
   
    Ligation product is transformed in ECOSTM competent cells.
    Steps:
      1. Thaw competent cells in the room temperature water bath with circulating water or hold the tube under running tap water for ~20 seconds until 1/3~1/2 volume is thawed.
      2. Add DNA (pre-chilled on ice, volume should be ≦ 5% of competent cells) immediately. Vortex for 1 second or tap the tube with finger to mix well.
      3. Heat-shock the cells in the pre-warmed 42℃ water bath for 30~45 seconds.
      4. Plate the cells using plating beads onto a pre-chilled (4℃) and dried antibiotic-selected LB agar plate.
      5. Incubate the plates at 37℃.
6. RBS activity measurement
    Bacterial colonies were selected and cultured in M9 medium (with glucose). When bacteria grew to steady-state, 5μL bacterial medium was transferred into a new tube with 5ml M9 medium. Approximately 4-hours after incubation in shaker, the O.D. ratio of the bacterial medium should increase to 0.1, and the sample was measured for green fluorescence activity. All fluorescence measurements were performed on a flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon excitation laser and a 515–545 nm emissions filter.

    For each sample, 100,000 events were collected. A small gate  in the side-scatter and forward-scatter space was chosen to reduce the  variations in cell size and help remove noise in fluorescence measurements.  Fluorescence intensities were converted to molecules of equivalent fluoresces  in based on daily measurements of SPHERO Rainbow Calibration Particles. We  selected forty different colonies with one wild type colony as our samples and  control (the green one in Fig. 6). The final data of green fluorescence activity  shows only thirty-eight different data sets as two were later on excluded.

    Then we picked eight samples  with different GFP expression activity to sequence (labed in red in Fig. 6). The  sequence results are displayed in Fig. 7. Six mutated RBS with different  sequences were obtained and translational activity was measured by flow cytometry.

    Additionally, we measured the florescence intensity of each mutant  (Fig. 7) during the 7 hours in which the O.D> ration rose to 0.1(Fig. 8). As  shown in Fig. 8, there are roughly four different GFP expression level. In 38  mutated samples, four samples with different translational activity were  selected. In  37 mutated samples, six samples with different translational activity were  selected. The results indicate our protocol can efficiently generate a RBS  library with different translational activities.

    Our team has designed a simple and rapid protocol to generate a RBS  library. This RBS library with different translational strength can be built to  tune the specific parameter values derived from model equations. In summary, we  took the following the steps.  Degenerated  primers designed for PCR are used to generate mutations in RBS regions. The translational  activity was then assayed using a reporter protein (GFP). Because the reporter  protein activity has positive correlation to RBS activity, we can choose the  suitable translational strength of the RBS for our design scheme.
