iGEM 2010
Protocols
For our iGEM2010 project, we have used a variety of techniques such as -
Restriction digest of DNA plasmids
Gel electropheresis of DNA products to check for correct length and quantity of DNA present
Selective culture of E-coli and Yeast in liquid and Agar Medium (LB and SD)
PCR Amplification
Transformation of shuttle vectors into yeast
DNA extraction for E-coli by Spin Mini-Prep
Microscopy, Fluorimetry and FACS
Many of these techniques are standard protocols carried out regularly in the lab and many iGEM teams will be familiar with them.
However, we have also used some additional techniques which may require further details. These are included as follows -
Construction of Plasmids In Vivo using Yeast Homologous Recombination
BioBrick Construction
Induction protocols for the GAL1, CUP1 and MET17 promoters
FACS analysis of Fluorescent Proteins
