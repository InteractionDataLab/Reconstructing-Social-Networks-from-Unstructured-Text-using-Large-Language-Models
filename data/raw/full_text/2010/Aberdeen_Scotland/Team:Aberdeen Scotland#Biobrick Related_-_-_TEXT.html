iii.BBa_I716101 plasmid and BBa_P1010 (CcdB – death gene)
Week 2 (21st – 25th of June)
1.Design of Primers for construction of Biobricks
i.MS2 protein
ii.MS2 loops: 5’leader
iii.N peptide (1)
iv.N peptide (2)
v.Bbox – 5’leader
2.Due to unclear results obtained in the prior digestion we repeated the digestion of BioBricks:
i.BBa_I716101 plasmid and BBa_J04450 (RFP)
ii.BBa_I716101 plasmid and BBa_P1010 (CcdB – death gene)
Week 3 (28th – 2nd July)
1.Bgl Brick Preparation:
i.Digestion 1, of BglBrick 1, using EcoR1 and Xho1 – higher volume than protocol since concentration of plasmid was very low.
ii.Enzymes then heat inactivated
iii.Vector then alkaline phosphatase treated, with enzymes again heat inactived after treatment.
Week 4 (5th – 9th of July)
1.Miniprep of BglBrick 1
2.Digestion of BglBrick using EcoR1 and Xho1 – due to low yield when previously digested.
3.PCR 1 reaction of inserts (to use for BglBrick cloning)
4.Transformation of BglBrick into one shot competent cells E.coli cells, to try and improve plasmid propagation – no improved propagation observed.
Week 5  (12th – 16th of July)
1.Further Bgl Brick preparation:
i.Miniprep of BglBrick
ii.Digestion of BglBrick
iii.Enzyme heat inactivation
iv.Alkaline phosphatase treatment.
2.Digestion 1 of PCR products using EcoR1 and Xho1
3.Ligation 1 of PCR products (inserts 1) and vector BglBrick
Used Nanodrop to determine concentration, we have concluded the data obtained in this way is unreliable, which is why this procedure may not have been successful.
4.Transformation 1, of cloned products into XL1 Blue subcloning – grade cells E.coli cells.
5.Transformation 2, of cloned products into XL1 Blue competent E.coli cells. Since transformation 1 gave poor efficiency, a more competent cell was tried.
6.PCR of E.coli colonies from BglBrick 1 – Did not work.
7.Design and order of mOrange primers for Bio-brick testing
8.Background reading for  Bgl-Brick vector and Bgl-bricking
9.Mini-prep, digest and gel electrophoresis of Bgl-Brick vector and pRS415 vector
Week 6 (19th – 23rd of July)
1.More Bgl Brick preparation since previous involved Nanodrop concentration determination but was decided this analysis is unrealiable:
i.Miniprep of BglBrick
ii.Digestion of BglBrick
iii.Enzyme heat inactivation
iv.Alkaline phosphatase treatment.
2.Background reading and planning for PCR
3.Background reading and planning of alkaline phosphatase and ligation reaction for Bgl-bricking
Week 7 (26th – 30th of July)

1.Confirmation of BglBricks produced:
i.Plasmid purification (miniprep) of E.coli colonies from Transformation 3 colonies.
ii.Digestion of plasmid with
iii. Ecor1 and Xhol1
iv.Ecor1 – since insert was not being observed on the gel when cut with two enzymes.
2.Further Bgl Brick preparation as we ran out:
i.6 X Miniprep of BglBrick
ii.Combined all 6 from step i. To obtain a higher concentration of BglBrick using Qiagen PCR kit (check name of kit).
iii.Digestion of BglBrick using EcoR1 and Xho1
iv.Digestion had to be done twice as some uncut vector remained after the first cut.
v.Enzyme heat inactivation
vi.Alkaline phosphatase treatment.
3.Tested BY4741 pRS415 mOrange transformants
4.Read through protocol for PCR colony screening
Week 9 (9th – 14th of August)
1.Digestion 1, of E.coli colonies from BglBrick 2 using EcoR1 and Xho1.

5.Transformation 2, of cloned products into XL1 Blue competent – grade E.coli cells.
