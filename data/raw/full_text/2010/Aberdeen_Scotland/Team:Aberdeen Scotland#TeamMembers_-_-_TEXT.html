iGEM 2010
Krystal Annand
BSc (Hons) Chemistry: University of Aberdeen
I have just graduated from Aberdeen University with an honours degree in Chemistry and am now looking for a chemistry related job.  I have enjoyed participating in the iGEM project and meeting a lot of great people and can not wait to see Boston and all the other projects!
Brychan Cromwell
MEng Chemical Engineering (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
I am currently in my fourth year of Chemical Engineering degree.  As well as being on the iGem team, I am in charge of the presentation for Aberdeen's Formula Student team (Tau Racing), working on my thesis on fuel injection systems in car engines, president of Aberdeen University Engineering Society and the ExxonMobil Student Ambassador for Aberdeen Uni.
I am also very much looking forward to going to Boston and can't wait for the Jamboree!
Lisa Dryburgh
BSc Hons Maths and Physics (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
I've just started my 4th and final year of my honours degree.  Also just started an honours project on Game Theory which is challenging but also interesting!  I loved being part of iGEM and spent most of my summer in front of a computer whilst listening to Margaret-Ann singing Disney! :D
Joseph Hoare
BSc Hons Immunology (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
Joseph is currently finishing his degree at Aberdeen.
Justyna Kucia
MSci Biotechnology (Applied Molecular Biology) with Industrial Placement: University of Aberdeen
I am in my forth year of Biotechnology degree. This year I am doing my industrial placement at MedImmune in Cambridge and I work on monoclonal antibody aggregation project. I really enjoyed iGEM project. This was definitely one of the best experience undergraduate students can get :) I can’t wait to meet all the teams in Boston and see their great projects and ideas!
Stephen Lam
University of Aberdeen
Stephen is in his fourth year of study of Immunology with a year’s Industrial placement at Aberdeen University. He is currently on placement at Novartis, Basel and investigating B cell activation signalling pathways. He joined the iGEM team to develop his knowledge of molecular biology and laboratory skills. His interests include ceilidh dancing, badminton and learning German. He used to play Triangle for his local band 'The Duffel Coats'
Christina McLeman
BSc Hons Geology (2:1, 2006), BSc Physics (1st, 2010), PhD Physics, Maths and Hydrology (1st Year): University of Aberdeen
I finished my undergraduate degree in physics this year and moved straight into doing a PhD at the University of Aberdeen. My research is interdisciplinary between physics, maths and hydrology. I am looking at applying mathematical models to river networks in order to study their fractal properties. I hope to find a link between the geometric and physical properties in order to predict and control river behaviour. I also take extra classes in maths and evening classes in German. I really enjoyed working on the iGEM project over the summer months and I am looking forward to presenting our results at the iGEM jamboree in Boston this November!
Ben Porter
BSc Hons Physics (4th Year): University of Aberdeen
My fourth year of physics has just begun, which has brought a medley of new challenges for me to get stuck into.  The best of these is my honours project where I'll be putting solid oxides through the path of fire to test their mettle (or performing ac impedance spectroscopy if you listen to my supervisor).  iGEM was an experience without comparison and I'm looking forward to joining all of the other teams in Boston.
Maragaret-Ann Seger
BS Electrical Engineering (2nd Year): Olin College
Margaret-Ann attends Olin College.
Liz Threlkeld
BS Maths and Biology (2nd Year): Olin College
I am currently a second year student at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts.  I haven't declared a major yet, but it will be a sweet self-designed combination of engineering, biology, and applied mathematics when I get around to it.  But really, there are only three things you need to know about me: I have eight cats, I am awkward at all else, and I have a freakish obsession with math."
