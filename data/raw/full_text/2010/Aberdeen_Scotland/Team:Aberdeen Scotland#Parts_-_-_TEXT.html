1 Part:BBa_K385002:    Phage MS2 coat protein
2 Part:BBa_K385003:    Phage lambda N-peptide
3 Part:BBa_K385004:    Phage lambda N-peptide, tandem repeat
4 Part:BBa_K385005:    B-box sequence encoding a regulatory mRNA stem loop
Part:BBa_K385002 :    Phage MS2 coat protein
Length:    414 bp
Part type: coding
Part information
This sequence encodes the MS2 coat protein from phage MS2. It has the property of being able to bind RNA stem loops in a sequence-specific manner. The sequence of the MS2 stem loops is provided in part number BBa_K385000. The coding sequence is supplied without a stop codon, so that it can be used as part of an N-terminal fusion. Sequence analysis has been confirmed.

Design Notes
We omitted the stop codon so this part could be used in a protein fusion construct, with the MS2 protein forming the N-terminal domain. A glycine rich spacer peptide was inserted at the 3' end of the sequence, to allow the N-peptide to be separated from any downstream ORF by a flexible linker.

Part:BBa_K385003 :    Phage lambda N-peptide
Length:    90 bp
Part type: coding
Part information
N-peptide from phage lambda. This protein coding sequence functions in a phage transcriptional termination control mechanism, by binding to an RNA stem loop (B-box Part:BBa_K385005 ) in a sequence specific manner. This peptide can be used as part of a translational control strategy for eukaryote gene expression. The B-box sequence should be placed in the 5' leader of a gene whose expression is to be controlled, and the N-peptide is expressed in trans to regulate ribosomal scanning. Sequence analysis has been confirmed.

Applications
The Aberdeen 2010 iGEM team has no direct experience of using BBa_K385003 , but the closely related part BBa_K385004 . consisting of a tandem repeat of the N-peptide, allowed the functional expression of a downstream GFP reporter.
Design Notes
The part was engineered with an AUG, but no stop codon, to allow the part to be used as a translational fusion with another downstream open reading frame. A glycine rich spacer peptide was inserted at the 3' end of the sequence, to allow the N-peptide to be separated from any downstream ORF by a flexible linker.

Part:BBa_K385004 :    Phage lambda N-peptide, tandem repeat
Length:    177 bp
Part type: coding
Part information
Two copies of the N-peptide from phage lambda, arranged as a tandem repeat. The N-peptide protein coding sequence functions in a phage transcriptional termination control mechanism, by binding to an RNA stem loop (B-box) in a sequence specific manner. This peptide can be used as part of a translational control strategy for eukaryote gene expression. The B-box sequence should be placed in the 5' leader of a gene whose expression is to be controlled, and the N-peptide is expressed in trans to regulate ribosomal scanning. Tandem repeats of the N-peptide were cloned in this BioBrick so as to optimise binding opportunities to the target mRNA stem loop. confirmed sequence

Applications
The N-peptide tandem repeat reading frame was fused in-frame to GFP to make a translational fusion. It was placed under control of the yeast GAL1 promoter (BBa_J63006), and transformed into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the single copy shuttle vector pRS415.  The transformants were grown overnight in synthetic defined medium containing 2% w/v galactose, and observed using a fluorescence microscope optimised for GFP visualisation (Figure 1).
A control culture of the same transformant was grown using glucose as the carbon source; these conditions do not activate the GAL promoter. The results (Figure 2) show no GFP fluorescence.  Overall the results indicate that the N-peptide can be successfully expressed as a protein fusion with other standard parts.
Design Notes
The part was engineered with an AUG, but no stop codon, to allow the part to be used as a translational fusion with another downstream open reading frame. A glycine rich spacer peptide was inserted at the 3' end of each of the tandem N-peptide repeats, to allow the N-peptide to be separated from each other, and any downstream ORF by a flexible linker.

Part:BBa_K385005 :    B-box sequence encoding a regulatory mRNA stem loop
Length: 56 bp
Part type: Regulatory
Part information
This part encodes a sequence that is capable of forming a stem loop in the mRNA. Moreover, this stem loop is bound in a sequence and structure-specific manner by the N-peptide sequence (see part numbers BBa_K385003 and BBa_K385004 ). The mRNA stem sequence is derived from phage lambda, and forms part of a transcriptional termination attenuation system. This stem loop encoding sequence can be used as part of a eukaryote gene expression control strategy. Insertion of this stem loop into the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of a target gene (i.e. between the transcript start site and the AUG translation initiation site) will allow this mRNA to be actively translated in the absence of the N-peptide sequence. However, expression of the N-peptide in trans will allow N-peptide binding to the B-box stem, causing translational attenuation by inhibition of ribosome scanning along the 5'UTR.
