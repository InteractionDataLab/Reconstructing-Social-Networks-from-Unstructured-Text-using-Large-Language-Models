What is directed evolution?
In protein engineering, the method of directed evolution is used to harness the power of natural selection.  This is to evolve certain proteins or RNA with desirable properties not found in nature.  Rather than swapping out different components of the structure, directed evolution can be used to manipulate the behaviour of these components.  Then, by screening or selection, we can obtain the desired phenotype.
