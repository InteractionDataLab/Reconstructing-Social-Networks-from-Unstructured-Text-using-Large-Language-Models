Monday
31. Experiment: Diagnostic gel to test for luciferase insertion (Theo & Anja)
Took overnight culture of TOP10 transformed with plasmid (potentially) containing promoter + rbs and luciferase
Plasmid DNA purification
following  "QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit using a Microcentrifuge" protocol
Gel electrophoresis
E-gel EX Agarose 1% mounted on transilluminator Nanodrop readings:
Plasmid with promoter + rbs + luciferase: 18.5ng/μl => 5μl gives 100ng
Plasmid with promoter + rbs only: 64.9ng/μl => 2μl gives 100ng
Gel loading mixture:
promoter + rbs + luciferase
promoter + rbs only
6X orange loading Dye
3μl
3μl
plasmid DNA
5μl
2μl
deionised H2O
12μl
12μl
Supercoiled DNA ladder loading mixture
1μl Supercoiled DNA ladder (NEB)
3μl 6X orange loading Dye
16μl deionised H2O
Gel was loaded following scheme below:
Supercoiled DNA ladder
promoter + rbs only
promoter + rbs + luciferase
20μl
20μl
20μl
Empty wells were filled with 200μl deionised H2O. Gell was run and a clear band around 2kb was visible for promoter + rbs, a very faint band was observed around 4kb for promoter + rbs + luciferase.
Gel electrophoresis
was repeated with increased promoter + rbs + luciferase plasmid concentration
Gel loading mixture for promoter + rbs + luciferase
(others as above)
3μl 6X orange LD
15μl plasmid DNA
2μl deionised H2O
Gel was run and the same bands were observed as above, with the ~4kb promoter + rbs + luciferase more clearly than before
32. Experiment: In vitro assay for luciferase activity (Theo & Anja)
50μl of TOP10 cells transformed with plasmid containing promoter + rbs + luc were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and subjected to three rounds of freeze (-80°C) and thaw (37°C) treatement. 50μl of 2mg/ml luciferin  were added tot he lysed bacteria and luminescence was tested using a CCD camera. The experiment was performed twice in a row and both times luminescence was observed with the CCD camera (though not by eye in the dark room).
Tuesday
33. Experiment: In vitro assay for luciferase activity using CHBT as substrate (Theo and Anja)
2ml of TOP10 with promoter, rbs and luc were spun at 13000rpm for 5 mins. Supernatant was discarded and cell pellet was resuspended in 500μl fresh LB to which 1 drop of chloroform was added. The cells were subjected to three rounds of freeze (-80°C) and thaw (37°C) treatment.
EXPERIMENT WAS CANCELLED!
34. Experiment: Preparation of Photobacterium Broth (Theo and Anja)
35.2g broth promoter was dissolved in 500ml water by warming/boiling. Broth was filter sterilised.
35. Experiment: Ampoule of Photobacterium (extracted by Theo and Peter)
Ampoule was broken, 500μl LB broth added and 100μl added to each of 5 falcons containing broth.
Wednesday
Theo added 5g agar to 250ml broth and placed for autoclaving.
After autoclaving the medium was turbid. It was poured into 9 empty, sterile dishes and left to set on the bench.
Thursday
36. Experiment: Renewed colonies of TOP10/pHK555 & pHK724 (Will)
Inoculated 2x5ml LB with 1 colony for each
Streaked out cells on Amp + Chl plate (*)
Incubated both at 30°C overnight.
Results:
1 LB glow very faintly, other not at all
Poor growth from streaking, but strong glow
Friday
36. Experiment: Transformation of TOP10 competent cells with luxR from registry (Bill)
Followed transformation protocol from 02/08/10
Transformed with BBa_I0462 from distribution from distribution Kit Plate 1 Well 80
Plated out on 2 ampicillin plates the transformation, (amp is resistance marker of plasmid)
Also cultured in 2 LB + Amp plates
Results (Hannah):

37. Experiment: Plating out of registry stabs (Theo)
Theo plated out BBa_K216007 and 08 on A plates
38. Experiment: Inoculated growth media for extraction of plasmid pHK555 for use in oligos (Will)
5ml SOB + 2.5μl Chloramphenicol + 1 colony Invitrogen 10 with pHK555 (from plate 5/8/10)
5ml SOB + 2.5μl Chloramphenicol + 10μl of glycerol stock of Slock10/pHK555 cells
5ml LB + 2.5μl Chloramphenicol + 1 colony Invitrogen 10 with pHK555 (from plate 5/8/10)
39. Experiment: Restreaked TOP10/pHK555+pHK724 (Will)
Using poorly grown strain from yesterday (*) restreaked onto LB agar+Chl+Amp (hope to select for strong growth).
40. Experiment: Streaked out Invitrogen 10 pHK555 (from plate 5/8/10) (Will)
On Chl plate, for colony PCR of pHK555 Plasmid
Saturday
41. Experiment: Culturing in broth of TOP10+LuxR from registry (Hannah)
Took single colony from plate, added to LB+Amp broth
2 days later took them out and put in fridge
