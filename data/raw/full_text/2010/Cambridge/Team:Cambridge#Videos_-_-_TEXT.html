Videos
The Cambridge iGEM team created a number of videos, published on YouTube to engage both scientists and the general public with our work.
The Gibson Assembly Song was designed to promote the technique of Gibson Assembly and received over 8000 views.
The Bacterial Bubble lamp was intended to show the powerful effect of oxygen on light output and to bridge our far out science with conventional lighting.
We summarised our project in a video placed on YouTube.
We also made a short video Human Practices in 90 seconds to summarise our thoughts about sharing of information which came out of our considerations of the wider issues in synthetic biology.
