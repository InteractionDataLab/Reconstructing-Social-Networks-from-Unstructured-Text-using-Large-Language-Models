Parts submitted
The Cambridge iGEM team has submitted 20 parts to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .  Many of these parts have been extensively characterised. This data is stored in the Parts Registry, you can click on any BioBrick to view its technical datasheet.
Featured parts
BBa_K325219
Red luciferase and LRE operon from L. cruciata under pBAD
This part generates the luciferase and luciferin regenerating enzyme proteins from the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata, when induced by L-arabinose.  The luciferase produced has a point mutation Ser286Asn which gives it a redshifted emission spectrum as compared to wild-type.  The sequence of nucleotides is codon optimised for expression in E. coli.
BBa_K325909
V. fischeri luxCDABE under pBAD
This part generates luxCDABE proteins from the bioluminescent bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, when induced by L-arabinose.  The BioBrick produces light from basic metabolites found in E. coli, luxCDE produce the substrate used by luxAB for bioluminescence.  The part creates a blue light.
Parts based on bacterial systems
BBa_K325902
V. fischeri luxCD
This is a translational unit designed to produce V. fischeri luxC and luxD genes when placed under a suitable promoter. The DNA sequence is codon optimised for expression in E. coli. Both proteins are part of the  fatty aldehyde synthesis pathway.  luxC is a reductase and luxD is a acyltransferase.  LuxE must also be supplied to complete the pathway for fatty aldehyde synthesis.  Such fatty aldehydes are the substrate for the luxAB bacterial luciferase.
BBa_K325903
V. fischeri luxEG
This is a translational unit designed to produce V. fischeri luxE and luxG genes when placed under a suitable promoter. The DNA sequence is codon optimised for expression in E. coli. luxE functions as the synthetase creating fatty aldehydes for bioluminescence. LuxG is a flavin reductase.
BBa_K325905
luxCDEG pLambda AB
This part constitutively expresses the Xenorhabdus luminescens luxAB luciferase already in the registry.  It also features a translational unit for the substrate generating luxCDEG from Vibrio fischeri.  This means that only when supplied with PoPs will it produce light output.
BBa_K325906
pBAD luxCDEG pLambda AB
This is the same as the part above but was built for testing induction by adding the pBAD promoter, making light inducible by addition of L-arabinose.
Firefly luciferases
BBa_K325101
Luciferase from Photinus pyralis with increased substrate affinity
This is a translational unit for a  mutated and codon-optimised form of the luciferase from the North American firefly, Photinus pyralis.  It is described in Fujii et al. 2007 as having a 10 times higher substrate affinity and luminescence output compared to wildtype.
BBa_K325108
P.pyralis luciferase under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but placed under the pBAD promoter induced by L-arabinose for characterisation.
BBa_K325211
L. cruciata luciferase (red mutant)
This is a translational unit for a mutant (Ser286Asn) and codon-optimised luciferase from the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata. It is deeply red-shifted as compared to wild type.
BBa_K325218
L. cruciata luciferase under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but placed under the pBAD promoter induced by L-arabinose for characterisation.
Firefly luciferin regenerating enzymes
BBa_K325102
P. pyralis Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme
This is a translational unit for a  codon-optimised Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme (LRE) from the North American firefly, Photinus pyralis.
BBa_K325202
L. cruciata Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme
This is a translational unit for a  codon-optimised Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme (LRE) from the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata.
Firefly luciferase, LRE operons
BBa_K325210
Luciola cruciata LRE and luciferase
This translational unit combines the luciferin regenerating enzyme (BBa_K325202) and red-shifted luciferase (BBa_K325211) from the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata.  The luciferin regenerating enzyme helps to strengthen and sustain light output.
BBa_K325100
Photinus pyralis LRE and luciferase
This part combines the luciferin regenerating enzyme (BBa_K325102) and luciferase (BBa_K325101) from the North American firefly, Photinus pyralis.  The luciferin regenerating enzyme helps to strengthen and sustain light output.
BBa_K325109
Photinus pyralis LRE and luciferase under pBAD
This part is the part above expressed under pBAD for characterisation.
BBa_K325209
L. cruciata LRE and luciferase (wildtype) under pBAD
This part combines the Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme and luciferase from the Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata.  It is expressed under pBAD.
BBa_K325229
L. cruciata LRE and luciferase (green) under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but with a Val239Ile mutation which green-shifts its emission spectrum.
BBa_K325239
L. cruciata LRE and luciferase (red) under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but instead has a Gly326Ser mutation which red-shifts its emission spectrum.
BBa_K325249
L. cruciata LRE and luciferase (scarlet) under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but instead has a His433Tyr mutation which red-shifts its emission spectrum.
BBa_K325259
L. cruciata LRE and luciferase (yellow) under pBAD
This is the same as the part above but instead has a Pro452Ser mutation which shifts its emission spectrum to peak at a yellow wavelength.
