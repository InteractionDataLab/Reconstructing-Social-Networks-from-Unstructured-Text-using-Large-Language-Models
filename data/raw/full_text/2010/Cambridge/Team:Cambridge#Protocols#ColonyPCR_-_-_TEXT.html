Colony PCR
Materials
2x Phusion Mastermic
Primers
Nuclease free H2O
Cell culture!
Method
Pick a single colony and place in 20µL of H20.
Cell lysis:
Incubate 10 min @ 98°C
Freeze 10 min @ -80°C
Vortex for 2-5 min
In a PCR tube mix:
10µL of 2X Phusion Mastermix
1µL of DNA template (lysate
XµL of Primer 1
XµL of Primer 2
7µL of Nuclease free H2O
Run PCR:
Initial Denaturation: 30s @ 98°C
Denaturation: 10s @ 98°C
Annealing: 30s @ Y°C
Elongation: 30s per kb @ 72°C
Reapeat steps 2-4, 25 to 35 times
Final Elongation: 10 min @ 72°C
Final Hold: ∞ @ 4°C
Notes
For Biobrick primers ( VF2 and VR ) from James Brown we used the following values:
X = 1µL
Y = 65°C
