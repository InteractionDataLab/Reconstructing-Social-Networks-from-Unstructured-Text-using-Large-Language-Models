Gel electrophoresis
pBAD failed - band at ~5000bp, should be 1200
others look about right ~ between 3 & 5kb (should be 3600bp)
Gel extraction - results in -20°C freezer
Wednesday
108. Expt: Send off PP + pSB1C3, EPIC pBAD for sequencing (Emily and Peter)
Miniprep EPIC pBAD and nanodrop
Prepare correct concentrations (100ng/µl for plasmid, 3.2pmol/µl for primers) to be sent off
109. Expt: Biobrick assembly of pBAD + PP Luc (1), PP Luc (2), LC Luc (1), PP+pSB1C3
Peter 'miniprepped' PP+pSB1C3 to extract plasmid
pBAD was amplified after trying to grow overnight culture failed. The following protocol was used:
Add to a PCR tube:
10µl
2x Phusion Master Mix
1µl
VF2 Primer
1µl
VR Primer
8µl
HPLC H20
20µl
Use stab to extract colony from pBAD plate and swirl in tube. Run following program on PCR machine saved as 'pBAD Amplification':
Heated lid at 110°C
Denaturation for 1m30s at 98°C
Cycle 35 times
Denaturation for 30s at 98°C
Elongation for 2m at 72°C
Elongation for 7m30s at 72°C
PCR Purification of pBAD from PCR reaction was performed using Qiagen kit
Restriction: repeating restriction of LC Luc (1) because tube from yesterday was dropped. Use protocol on p88 with following quantities (in µl):
pBAD
LC Luc (1)

'*' Nanodrop said 29ng/µl after PCR Purification, which was strangely low. So used 16µl as recommended (in order to not exceed 0.2µg) but maximise amount of DNA.
Gel electrophoresis: Run gel with following quantities:

111. Expt: continuation of Biobrick assembly of pBAD with P.P.Luc(1), P.P.Luc(2), L.C.Luc(1), P.P.pSB1C3  (Emily)
Ligation: Accidentally forgot to restrict P.P.pSB1C3 so will do that later. Followed ligation protocol on p91 with following quantities:
P.P.Luc(1)
P.P.Luc(2)

Cells that were ligated were then transformed
There was not enough pBAD to ligate L.C.Luc(1) ==> PCR lots of pBAD.

Ran on a gel with 17µl DNA + 3µl of 6x orange LD in this order: Hyperladder I, pBAD 1, pBAD 2, pBAD 3, PP Luc2, PP pSB1C3
All bands were as expected: pBAD - 1200bp, PP Luc(2) - 3600bp, PP pSB1C3 - ~4500bp
Ben gel extracted
Ligation
Following protocol on p91, incubating at RT for 30 mins. The nanodrop reading for PPLuc(2) was so bad (2.8ng/µl) that the ligation was not performed because PPLuc(1) had already been transformed with a small amount of pBAD yesterday. Wait for results of that.
Nanodrops:
pBAD 1 -> 3.2ng/µl
pBAD 2 -> 34.5ng/µl
pBAD 3 -> 15.3ng/µl
PP pSB1C3 -> 11.5ng/µl

Results
Glowing growth on PPLuc(2) plates and PP pSB1C3 plates
Growth but no glow on LC Luc(1) plates
No growth on PP Luc(1) plates
Results later that day:
LC Luc(1) now glowing :)
Thursday
112. Expt: Plate reader experiment. G28 and effect of D-luciferin on LC+LRE
This experiment was designed to measure the effect of Arabinose on G28 light output and D-luc level on LC/Red mutant. The layout was as follows (Blanks contain 30µl H20 + 70µl LB):
