Collaboration with iGEM Teams
As a team we thought that it was very important to work together with other teams, since iGEM is an effort to build a registry of parts together, as well as a competition.  We respectfully disagree with teams who work on their wiki behind the scenes and then upload it days before the deadline.  We think that collaboration is fostered if all teams can see how each other are progressing and ask for help from an appropriate team.  As it happened, our openness allowed Mexico to ask us for some of our constructs and fostered an extensive collaboration.
Teams
Sheffield iGEM
The Sheffield team needed an additional sample of pSB1C3, we were able to send them a stab.
 
UNAM Genomics Mexico
At the beginning of the Summer we established a collaboration with the team from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  When they had problems measuring any light output we sent them our constructs, which gave them more success.  We also shared protocols for best measurement techniques.
