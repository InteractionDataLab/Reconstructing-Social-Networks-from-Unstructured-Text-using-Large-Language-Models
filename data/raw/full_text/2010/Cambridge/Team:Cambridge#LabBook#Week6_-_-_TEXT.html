Placed in incubator at 30°C
Tuesday
46. Experiment: Transformation of TOP10cc with BBa_R0040 (TetR repressed promoter), BBa_E0030 (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) separately. (Theo & Anja)
BBa_R0040 (Plate 1, Well 6L) and BBa_E0030 (Plate 2, Well 24E) were resuspended in 10μl deionised H20.
TOP10cc were taken out of -80°C freezer and thawed on ice. 1ml pipette tip cut with scissors (sterile). 2x50μl of TOP10cc were transformed to 1.5ml eppendorf tubes.
2μl of resuspended BBa_R0040 and 2μl of resuspended BBa_E0030 were added to separate eppendorf tubes with TOP10cc. Cells were held on ice for 30mins. Heat shocked for 60s at 42°C (waterbath). Put on ice for ~2mins. Added 250μl pre-warmed (37°C) soc. Incubated at 37°C for 1h with rotation. Plated 50μl on pre-warmed (in 37°C incubator) LB agar plates with:
Amp for BBa_R0040
Kan for BBa_E0030
Grow colonies overnight at 37°C.
46. Experiment: Streaking out and setting up overnight cultures of TOP10 with promoter + rbs + luc (Anja)
Streaked out from a single colony on an LB agar plate with Amp and incubate at 37°C overnight.
Inoculated single bacterial colony in 5ml LB with 5μl (100mg/ml) Ampicillin, incubated at 37°C with shaking overnight.
47. Experiment: Using plate reader to characterise light output of the pHK724+pHK555 in Slock10 and TOP10 as they grew. (Paul)
Grew the following (1/2 Slock10, 1/2 TOP10):
10 x Cells + Medium LB + Amp
10 x Cells + Medium LB + Chl
10 x Cells + Medium LB + Amp + Chl
Final concentrations of Amp = 100μg/ml, Chl = 20μg/ml
Growth - at 30°C as we hope this will maximise light output.
Volume per well - 100μl of total (= LB + Chl/Amp + Cells)
Cells used - grown up in broth on previous day by Paul in LB + antibiotic broth.
Wednesday
48. Experiment: Making long-term stock of TOP10 with promoter + rbs + p.p.luc (Peter)
Added 0.5ml 40% glycerol solution and 0.5ml sample culture to cryogenic vial (x2). Gently vortexed.
Stored in -80°C freezer in 'Black-GM230hns-205' storage box. Vials labelled with sticker 'TetR luc'.
49. Experiment: Transfer of promoter + rbs + p.p.luc into psB1C3 for submission to registry. (Will, Peter & Anja)
1.5ml of TOP10 cells with promoter+rbs+luc grown overnight in LB+Amp were transferred to eppendorf tubes (x2) and cells were spun down in microcentrifuge (1min, 13000rpm). Suernatant was discarded and plasmid was purified following the 'QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit using a microcentrifuge' protocol.
Nanodrops showed 135.1ng/μl DNA present in purified plasmid prep (EB as blank).
Restriction enzyme digest
Prepared at room temperature in the listed order:
nuclease-free H20
14μl
10x Fast Digest Buffer
2μl
Plasmid DNA
2μl
FD Enzyme EcoRI
1μl
FD Enzyme PstI
1μl
20μl
It was checked (Nanodrop!) that 2μl of plasmid DNA would not contain more than 1μg of DNA. The reaction was mixed gently, spun down and incubated at 37°C (PCR machine) for 30mins. Enzymes were inactivated by heating at 80°C for 10mins (in PCR Machine).
DNA Purification
was carried out following the 'QIAquick PCR Purification Kit Protocol (using a microcentrifuge)' The DNA was stored overnight at -20°C.
Thursday
50. Experiment: Continued transfer of promoter + rbs + p.p.luc into psB1C3 for submission to registry. (Will and Anja)
Gel Electrophoresis
Nanodrop reading was taken for the restriction enzyme digest.
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc:   1ng/μl
1% Agarose gels were poured following the below protocol:
Preparation 1% Agarose Gels (2 gels)
1g (agarose)/100ml (TAE - better resolution > 4kb / TBE - better resolution 0.1-3kb) --> 0.5 - 10kb optimal DNA resolution
Measure agarose into beaker with buffer (50ml for 7x10cm gel box)
Microwave until agarose fully melted
Let agarose cool on bench
Seal open edges of gel box with tape
Add 10μl Sybr Safe Dye to agarose sultion, swirl
Pour agarose solution in taped gel box, remove bubbles, put in comb, letit cool & solidify
Due to the low DNA concentration, it was decided to repeat the restriction enzyme digest (x3) following the same protocol as on p.31 without the enzyme inativation step.
Nanodrop measurements were taken for the restriction enzyme digests:
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 1   --   34.9ng/μl
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 2   --   14.4ng/μl
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 3   --   35.8ng/μl
Gel loading mixture was mude up: (4x) 3μl    6x orange loading dye 7μl    plasmid DNA (restriction digest) --> 245ng DNA 10μl   deionised H20 20μl
Gel was loaded as follows:
Easyladder II
Plasmid & promoter + rbs + luc (4 wells)
10μl
20μl
Gel was run for 40mins at 100V. No bands were observed.
Therefore, the restriction enzyme digest was repeated as on p.32.
Nanodrop readings:
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 1   --   14.6ng/μl
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 2   --   43.8ng/μl
Plasmid and promoter + rbs + luc 3   --   18.1ng/μl
4 gel loading mixtures were taken up.

Empty wells were loaded with deionised H20. The gel was run and two bands were observed. One just around 2kb --> plasmid backbone (2079b) and one a little lighter --> promoter+rbs+luc (1727b). The lower band was cut out of the gel and DNA was extracted following the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol.
Ligation
Nanodrop measurement of insert DNA
Promoter + rbs + luc:    4.5ng/μl pSB1C3 is supplied at:   25ng/μl  Chl. resistance
10-100ng of linearised vector DNA should be added to ligation mix; 3μl gives 75ng. 3:1 molar excess of insert DNA should be added.
75ng/2035b x 1727b x 3 = 190ng --> 42μl (189ng)
Added to a microcentrifuge tube:
Promoter + rbs + luc
42μl
pSB1C3
3μl
5x Rapid Ligation Buffer
12μl
T4 DNA ligase
3μl
60μl
Mix was vortexed, spun down for 15s at 13000rpm and incubated at 22°C (Room temperature) for 30 mins.
Transformation
Followed protocol on p.13+14, but transformed 2 x 50μl of TOP10cc. Also plated on LB agar plates with Chl.
Results: No colonies after 1 night. After 4 nights on one of the 4 plates there was 1 potential colony.
