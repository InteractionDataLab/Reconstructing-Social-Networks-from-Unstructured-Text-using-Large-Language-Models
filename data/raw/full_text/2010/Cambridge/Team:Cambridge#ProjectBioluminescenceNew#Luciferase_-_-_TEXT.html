Luciferase
Many different forms of luciferase are available for use. These vary with different colours, light output, thermal and pH performance. We can obtain these luciferases from a variety of organisms - fireflies, click beetles, and countless bioluminescent bacteria. A key task for us will be to select the most optimal luciferase.
