Project Vibrio: Modelling
We constructed a mathematical model of the Vibrio lux system.  Unfortunately we were not able to characterise the individual genes, luxC, luxD, luxE, luxA and luxB, well enough to gain the kinetic data needed to model this system. Therefore we do not have as detailed a model as we did for the firefly system Nevertheless here is a diagrammatic representation of our model, generated from SBML using the SBW layout tool .
The literature
Welham and Stekel (2009) developed a mathematical model of the Xenorhabdus luminescens system.  The organisation and function of the lux genes in this organism is very comparible to those of V. fischeri.
