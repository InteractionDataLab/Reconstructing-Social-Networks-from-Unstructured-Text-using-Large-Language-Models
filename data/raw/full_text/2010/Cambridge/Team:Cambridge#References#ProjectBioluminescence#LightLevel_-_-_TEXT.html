Relevant Physics
The Candela measures how much light perceivable to the human eye is being emitted by a source of radiation, the Luminous Intensity (or luminous flux. It is related to Radiant intensity (or radiant flux) (which is measured in watts per steradian) but has been weighted by a Luminosity function . This alters the power output so that it is proportional to the sensitivity of the human eye: Definition of the candela with respect to Radiant intensity. Therefore, an object which is black may be emitting a lot of radiation (measured in watts per steradian) but since it is not perceivable to the human eye it is emitting 0cd of radiation.
The lumen is simply cd*sr. It is thus the analogue to the Watt
The Lux measures how much light is incident on a suface, the Illuminance. It is related to irradiance (measured in Watts per m^2) but has been weighted again by the luminosity function. 1lux= 1lm/m^2 = 1cd*1sr/m^2
The luminance of an object is how much light is emitted from it. This is also measured in Lux, but it is different contextually.
A table of ambient illuminances. For our glowing bacteria to be seen from a given distance, they must be at least 1/20th of this value.

A brief summary of the different luminous measures
A site containing luminosity functions
To summarise, the luminosity function allows one to convert between radiant energy and luminous (i.e., visible) energy.
