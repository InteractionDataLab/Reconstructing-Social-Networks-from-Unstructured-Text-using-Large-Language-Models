We ran this gel on an E-gel and realised that those lanes with '*' had been cut with the wrong enzymes - PP+pSB1C3 should have been cut with S+P, the RFPs should have been cut with X+P.
We carried on with those that had worked with just pBAD.
See continuation below.
116. Expt: Plate reader readings for Arabinose induction for LCLuc+PPLuc under pBAD
Arabinose concentration varying from 0µM to 10mM
1. 0µM: 0Ara/30µl of H20
2. 1µM: 1µl of Ara@100µM/29µl of H20
3. 3µM: 3µl of Ara@100µM/27µl of H20
4. 10µM: 10µl of Ara@100µM/20µl of H20
5. 30µM: 30µl of Ara@100µM/no H20
6. 100µM: 1µl of Ara@10mM/29µl of H20
7. 300µM: 3µl of Ara@10mM/27µl of H20
8. 1mM: 10µl of Ara@10mM/20µl of H20
9. 3mM: 30µl of Ara@10mM/no H20
10. 10mM: 1µl of Ara@1M/29µl of H20
11. No luciferin, 100µM Ara => 1µl of 10mM, 30.5 of H20
D-luciferin at 100µM -> 15µl.
Total volume 100µl per well. 60.5µl of overnight culture

117. Expt: Repeat of Ben's experiment of altering the other 4 sites of LC luciferase using directed mutagenesis (Will)
PCR mixes were:
0.25µl forward primer
0.25µl reverse primer

Transformation into TOP10cc from freezer on Cm+Ara plates
Also transformed plambda+rbs from registry onto Cm plate. Should have been on Amp plate so did not grow.
Results
After 1 day - little colonies on all plates
After 2 days - looks like lots of cross-contamination. Only some colonies glow. Streaked out interesting colonies + grew up overnight culture
Wednesday

Arabinose concentrations were set up as on p109
D-luciferin at 10mM, 1µl were added
Cells were taken from liquid culture apart from ... which was taken from solid culture into LB
