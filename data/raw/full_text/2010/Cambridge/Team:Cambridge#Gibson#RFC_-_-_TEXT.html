Gibson Assembly: RFC
RFC 57 , submitted by the Cambridge team
The BioBrick Foundation uses documents known as RFC s to document standard techniques in synthetic biology.  Until now no such RFC existed for Gibson Assembly.  The Cambridge team created RFC 57 to provide standard protocols for the technique.
Gibson assembly allows joining any sequences using appropriate overlaps. As no restriction enzymes are used, this assembly method technically does not require the assembled parts to be in BioBrick format. It must however be emphasised that it is still necessary to comply with existing RFCs in terms of prefixes, suffixes and illegal sites for all new parts that are entered into the registry. Gibson assembly can be used as an alternative to BioBrick Standard Assembly, while retaining full backwards compatibility.
