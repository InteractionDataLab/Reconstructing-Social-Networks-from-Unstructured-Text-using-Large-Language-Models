Making long term stocks in glycerol
(From http://openwetware.org/wiki/Endy:Making_a_long_term_stock_of_bacteria )
Materials
40% glycerol solution
Cryogenic vials
Method
Add 1 ml of 40% glycerol in H2O to a cryogenic vial.
Add 1 ml sample from the culture of bacteria to be stored.
Gently vortex the cryogenic vial to ensure the culture and glycerol is well-mixed.
Alternatively, pipet to mix.
Use a tough spot to put the name of the strain or some useful identifier on the top of the vial.
On the side of the vial list all relevant information - part, vector, strain, date, researcher, etc.
Store in a freezer box in a -80C freezer.  Remember to record where the vial is stored for fast retrieval later.
Notes
While it is possible to make a long term stock from cells in stationary phase, ideally your culture should be in logarithmic growth phase.
