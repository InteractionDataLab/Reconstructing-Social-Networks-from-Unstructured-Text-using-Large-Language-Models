Experiments
1. Test luminescence with the Luciferase from the registry
Transform WT E.coli with the luciferase from the registry.
Feed with D-luciferin, develop a method for measuring light output
Variables - concentration of inducer (if luciferase promoter inducible), concentration of D-luciferin
Controls - no luciferin, no inducer
2. Test use of CHBT as a substrate
With sucessfully transformed cells from 1 compare emission when adding:
D-luciferin
CHBT
CHBT + D-Cysteine
CHBT + L-Cysteine
(CHBT + L-Luciferin? if necessary)
3. Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme
