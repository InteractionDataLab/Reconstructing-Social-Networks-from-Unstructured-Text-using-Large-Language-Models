1. Take tube of glycerol stock from -80°C 2. Use loop/tooth pick (we used a loop) to streak on ampicillin resistance plate. Let it melt first, then streak.
NB NEVER let glycerol stocks thaw. They should be out and back in the -80°C freezer in 2-3mins max
3. Place in 30°C incubator overnight.
To be continued tomorrow.
54. Check for promoter+rbs+luc from p32 by luciferin injection. (Paul and Ben)
We used protocol described on p22.

57. Experiment: Repeat gel electrophoresis from p.39+40 (Will and Anja)
Followed protocol on p.39+40 (pcr products had been kept in -20°C overnight).
Results: A, C, D, pA & pC were of appropriate size. B (again 3-5kb) and E, pE (slightly lower than expected, closer to D than C) were of inappropriate size.
It was decided to run new PCR reactions for B (CD) and E (pSB1C3) following the protocol on p.38.

58. Experiment: Making liquid culture of tetR repressed promoter, rbs + luc in TOP10 (from registry) (Peter and Emily)
Make LB broth with campicillin, adding 200µl ampicillin to 200ml LB to make 100µg/ml concentration final solution.
Plates prepared from glycerol stocks had grown well, but were transferred from 30°C to 37°C incubator for better growth - the temperature effect on luciferase won't matter. The coonies were very small. A single colony was chosen using a loop, placed in 3ml of LB&Amp and shaken. 3 tubes were used and placed in the 30°C incubator overnight.
59. Experiment: Gel Extraction (Anja)
Results from Gel electrophoresis on p.42.
E showed a band slightly above 2kb.
B again showed a band between 3-5kb.
Bands for A & pA, B, pC, D, pE were cut out from 'repeated' gel on p.41 and 'Enew' as well as a trace of seemingly correctly sized B ('B trace') were cut out from gel on p.42. DNA was extracted following the 'QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (miniElute columns)' protocol.
The purified DNA was stored at 4°C overnight.

Followed protocol on p13+14, however, we transformed with 10µl Gibson reaction instead of 2µl. Plated 150µl on LB agar plates with Chl. Incubated at 30°C overnight.
Result: All 4 plates blank after overnight :( All 4 growth after 2 days, RFP present, no glow.
Friday
Results: No colonies observed from above transformation.
64. Expt: Transfer of promoter+rbs+P.P.Luc into pSB1C3 for submission to registry (Emily + Anja)

The digest was prepared twice. It was checked that 15µl of plasmid DNA would not contain more than 1µg of DNA. The reaction was mixed gently, spun down and incubated at 37°C for 4h45min (in PCR machine).
Ligation
Nanodrop measurements: Digest 1 -> 18.3ng/µl Digest 2 -> 22.8ng/µl
pSB1C3 supplied at 25ng/µl.  10-100ng of linearised vector DNA should be added to ligation mix. 3µl give 75ng. 3:1 molar excess of insert DNA should be added.
75ng/2035b x 1727b x 3 = 190ng  => 9µl

Transformation
Followed protocol on p13+14. Transformed 2x50µl TOP10cc with ligation 1 and ligation 2 (10µl of ligation rather than 2µl). Plated on LB agar plates with Chloramphenicol (plated 150µl).
Results: No colonies from TOP10 transformation with ligation. Plate 1 of TOP10 cells transformed with ligation 1: 2 colonies. Plate 2: 5 colonies.

Results: Only for pBAD did we observe a band (this was of correct size).
=> PCR of luxCDABEG from pJS555 failed
=> PCR of pSB1C3 from BBa_J04450 transformed colony failed.
Following the 'MinElute Gel Extraction' protocol pBAD was isolated (using MinElute columns) and stored at 4°C.
66. Expt: PCR of pJS555 colony PCR of cells containing pSB1C3 (&RFP biobrick), PCR of pBAD (Will & Hannah)
Templates:
1. pJS555 was diluted 10x in nuclease free water (taken from vial sent by James Slock), and PCRed in 3 fragments: CD, AB, EG using primers ordered on 17.08.10.
2. A colony grown up with a pSB1C3 plasmid (with RFP biobrick) was suspended in 20µl DI autoclaved water. 2µl of this was added to standard PCR mix as "template".
3. Purified I0500 (from Shuna)

Naming system is as on pp38-41.
A, C, b, d in machine (2)
e in machine (3)
In addition, another b was run in machine (3) in an attempt to get rid of the problematic secondary structure in the template DNA (hypothesised). This tube was labelled B72.
After PCR tubes were run on Agarose on a single gel
Gel Preparation
150ml TAE + 1.5g Agarose + 10µl SYBERSAFE were prepared
8 Tooth comb was used
each well could house 30µl liquid
Machine (2) did not have top screwed on properly so tube containing D was lost. For the purposes of this assembly a aprevious PCR product of D was used, though there was only 10µl of this product left, so a reduced amount was used.
To D: 10µl PCR product + 2µl gel loading buffer was put in a well.
To A,B,C,E,B27: 35µl PCR product + 7µl Gel loading buffer, 30µl of which was loaded into a well.
10µl EZ ladder II was loaded.
The layour was: EZ ladder II, A, B, C, D, E, B72
After running for an hour, no banding was produced by E and B72.
But good bands of A, B, C, D were produced, including the CORRECT SIZED B BAND! :) :)
These 4 bands were extracted and purified according to Qiagen "Qiagen gel extraction kit", final ste 10µl of EB was added, although a normal column was used.
