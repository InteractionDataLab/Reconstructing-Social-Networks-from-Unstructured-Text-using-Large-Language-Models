Project Firefly: Codon optimisation
For a complete introduction to codon optimisation please see our more comprehensive page in Project Vibrio .
Our Firefly genes were kindly optimised by DNA 2.0 using their advanced in-house algorithms, this should result in improved expression in E. coli since there is a significant gap between codon usage in E. coli and fireflies.
Every single BioBrick we submitted based on genes from Photinus pyralis and Luciola cruciata is codon optimised.
