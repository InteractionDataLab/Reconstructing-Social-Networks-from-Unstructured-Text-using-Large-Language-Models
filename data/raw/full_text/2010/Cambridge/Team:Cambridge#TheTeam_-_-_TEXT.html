Meet the Team
Students
Anja Hohmann
Anja is a biochemist. She likes singing along to 'Fireflies', is extremely efficient and makes sure our lab book is always kept up to date.
Ben Reeve
Ben is a molecular biologist. He is the Hacky Sack-master, loves the word 'epic' and brought the beats to the Gibson Assembly song.
Bill Collins
Bill is a control engineer. He is the creator of Gibthon and always happy to assist with helpful advice: 'Get a Mac!'.
Emily Knott
Emily is a mechanical engineer. She will happily sing to you about Gibson Assembly. Alternatively, she might teach you the dance moves to 'Blame it on the Boogie'.
Hannah Copley
Hannah is a medic. She initated the 'wiki morning turns into afternoon turns into day turns into weekend' and was the only one to remember dress-up friday.
Paul Masset
Paul is a systems engineer. He is in charge of characterising our BioBricks, but generally found rowing on the river.
Peter Emmrich
Peter is a plant scientist. He is the team's personal photographer, an instigator of party games and likes plastering the lab with motivational posters.
Theo Sanderson
Theo is a geneticist. He makes good videos, funny faces and wins every fast walk competition.
Will Handley
Will is a physicist. He is our expert in oligo design, but can regularly be found juggling with all sorts of laboratory equipment.
Mission Statement
As a team of scientists and engineers from very diverse backgrounds we aim to create an environment in which every member is able to apply his or her unique talents and knowledge to the fullest. We will document our literature research as well as our experimental work on the wiki and the online labbook making new content available as soon as possible. To make our work more relevant and transparent we will clearly distinguish between theoretical designs, mathematical simulations and physically designed biological systems, and include measurements where appropriate.
Share and Enjoy
In the Open Source spirit of iGEM, we will try to make our ideas, the progress of our work and our results as open as possible. This requires honesty about which parts of our project succeeded, which ones yielded ambiguous results and which ideas had to be abandoned. We believe that such transparency will make our project more useful for future iGEM teams and researchers.
Although iGEM takes the form of a competition, all our work is ultimately a collaboration to create a registry that will act as a firm foundation supporting the scientists and engineers of the future.
Therefore, we would love to collaborate with other current iGEM teams working on related projects. If you think parts of our work could be useful to you, please get in contact and we will see how we can help. Conversely, if you have any resources or knowledge that you believe could help us, please let us know!
Attribution
Unless otherwise indicated, all work presented on this wiki is the sole work of the iGEM team members listed above. We are also extremely grateful for the help of the following advisors and instructors.
