Rough notes: Turing patterns
Research of the previous Team's work
iGEM Mexico 2007
Project Failed
Admitted were underfunded, no results shown
iGEM Mexico 2009
Apparently 11 out of 12 ligations were successful - they would have been able to test the system had the final ligation occurred.
The only experimental results were those demonstrating that AHL was initiating it's own transcription via the expression of GFP.
Seemed to have done quite a lot of good modelling work. So will be difficult to go much further on this aspect of the project
iGEM 2008 Cambridge team - iBrain
Planned to use similar quorum sensing mechanisms with the lux operon to detect activity. However, the lux operon would not work in a gram positive organism such as Bacillus therefore only E.coli could work.
Own Research
Papers on Turing Patterns
Original paper from Alan Turing: http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf
Further information
Different signalling mechanisms have a large amount of cross-talk in bacteria
The ACL Transcription factor is very specific initially but when bound becomes very non-specific, therefore cannot use two distinct systems in the same bacteria expressing different outputs in the same bacteria, instead 2 different strains would have to be used. This was the reason why a predator-prey model worked in a previous study.
In the proposed system, there would be an activator and an inhibitor, with different diffusion rates due to the chain length of the molecules. The activator would be a short chain molecule and the inhibitor a long chain molecule so that the inhibitor diffuses slowly.
One suggestion is that metabolites could be used as the morphogens in this system, for example metabolites that release or free another signalling molecule from the media, e.g. Arabinose - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabinose .
Another suggestion was peptide signalling, which uses an AGR-like system. There are 4 proteins, a pre-peptide, a processing, secreting and supporting peptide, and 2 sensing peptides.
Advantages of the Turing Project
A new quorum sensing molecular system could be added to the registry which if a proven system could be easily applied to other systems. This would stand alone as an achievement no matter what the other successes or failures.
Conclusion
Turing patterns have been well described theoretically
Mexico 2009 modelled the problem extensively
Our project WILL have to reach the implementation stage to go a step further
Some Biobricks exist. A lot of the project will have to do with fine tuning of the system
Combine with one of the other projects? Bioluminescence?
