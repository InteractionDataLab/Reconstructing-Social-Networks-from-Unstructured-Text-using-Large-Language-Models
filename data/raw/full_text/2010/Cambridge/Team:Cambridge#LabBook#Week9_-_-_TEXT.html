93. Expt: Extracting DNA 2.0 from Registry
Remove filter from plastic bag and place on a sterile and clean surface.
Add 100µl of 10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 directly to the center of the filter
Incubate at room temperature for 2minutes.
Puncture the bottom of at 0.6ml tube using a syringe.
Place filter in the 0.6ml tube and place 0.6ml tube in a 1.5ml tube.
Place the 1.5ml tube(now containing punctured 0.6ml tube with filter) in tabletop centrifuge.
Spin 1 minute at full speed. The DNA containing liquid will transfer from the filter in the 0.6ml tube into the 1.5ml tube.
Discard the 0.6ml tube with filter. The 1.5ml tube now contains ~90µl buffer+DNA.
Carefully remove supernatant. there may be a small pellet consisting of filter debris. This pellet does NOT contain any of the DNA. The supernatant should contain approximately 2µl plasmid DNA(~20ng/µl).
The isolated DNA can subsequently be transformed, cut with restriction enzymes, or sequenced without further purification.
Then transformed using standard protocol
Result: Colonies all grew
Wednesday
94. Expt: Ligating restriction digests from yesterday
Theo wished to prepare three constructs:
A: P[TetR repressed] - WT luciferase - YFP in pSB1C3
B: pBad Lux aoperon (G28) - YFP in pSB1C3
C: P[TetR repressed] - WT luciferase
Volumes all in µl

Theo then incubated for 5mins at 22°C and following transformation protocol, plating out on Chlor plates.
95. Expt: Colony PCR of cells transformed with the Gibson assembly product (pages 70,73) (Done by Peter)
Took 2 colonies of plates ABCDE each
ran PCR on G-storm ('Phusion Lng rng clny PCR')
27 cycles
melting: 98µl 15s
annealing: 60µl 10s
extension: 72µl 3min
final elongation 10min
Ran on E-gel:

no band visible at the expected 6.6kbp
PCR tubes placed in Freezer, ~30µl left
96. Expt: Colony PCR to extract the thioesterase gene from E. coli K-12 (repeat using new protocol)
We used K-12 strains from Veio collection ( JW3582 and JW5313) but during the cell lysis protcols writing on tubes was erased so we couldn't identify the 2 strains.
Cell lysis
Heat at 98 for 10 min
Freeze at -80 for 10min
Vortex for 2min
Cells were collected from plates and put in 20 of dH20
We performed 2 PCR (normal and touchdown) with 2 replicates for each strain and one negative control:

97. Expt: Restriction Digest of DNA2.0 stuff, tetR and pSB1C3 with RFP
Miniprepped:
DNA2.0 P. pyralis (x2)
DNA2.0 L. cruciata (x2)
TetR promotor
pSB1C3 + RFP
Nanodrop results:
On the side of the tubes in red pen
Restriction enzymes:
DNA2.0 P.P. --> E + P
DNA2.0 P.P. --> X + P
DNA2.0 L.C. --> E + P
DNA2.0 L.C. --> X + P
TetR --> E + S
pSB1C3 RFP --> E + P
Ran on gel, results in lab book. Look correct.
98. Expt: PCR to add 20bp to pSB1C3 to be able to Gibson it with Thioesterase from p83
PCR protocol similar to p83 but with:
Denaturation 30s @ 98°C
35 cycles:
Denaturation 12s @ 98°C
Annealing 20s @ 70°C
Elongation 45s @ 72°C
Elongation 7:30min @ 72°C
Hold at 10°C
It failed.
2nd attempt with annealing @ 69°C
We obtained results which were then extracted from the gel by Ben. We also added pure plasmid to compare intensities.
Lane 1: 1.8ng/µl
Lane 2: 2.3ng/µl
Lane 3: 4.5ng/µl
Lane 4: 24.5ng/µl
99. Expt: Gibson assembly of fragments from p87 and p84 (pSB1C3 and Thioesterase)
Readings for thioesterase extracted from expt p84 were as follows:
Lane 4: 5.7ng/µl
Lane 8: 12.7ng/µl
Lane 9: 12.4ng/µl
We performed more assembling:
Plasmid 4 --> Thio8
Plasmid 4 --> Thio9
Plasmid 3 --> Thio4
Plasmid 4 --> Thio4
Plasmid 1 --> Thio8
Plasmid 1 --> Thio9
Plasmid 3 --> Thio8
Plasmid 3 --> Thio9
Plasmid 2 --> Thio8
We used the standard protocol (OpenWetWare). We then ran gel with Lane 10 pSB1C3 from the registry as control.
We extracted the DNA samples marked in red (as the resulting plasmid should be circular so gel speed could be variable).
