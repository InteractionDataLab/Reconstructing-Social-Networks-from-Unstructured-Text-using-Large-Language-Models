Project Firefly: Modelling
Introduction
Download model in SBML format
We set out to build a mathematical model of our firefly system, featuring the activity of luciferase and luciferin regenerating enzyme.
We modelled the Luciferin cycle as described by Marques 2009 and others. We were assisted by data from S. Inouye (2010) on the catlysis of light emission by luciferase and  information J.M Leitão et al. (2010) on the inhibition of the enzyme.
We used the Matlab Simbiology toolbox to model the cycle. A diagram of the model we developed can be found below:
Some parameters were taken from literature.  However there was no clear data for others, such that we were only able to define some parameters in the light of experimental data.
Effect of LRE
While attempting to optimise our system we modelled the effect of Luciferin Regenerating Enzyme (LRE) .
Figure 1 - Model of the light output as a function of time without the effect of the LRE.
Our model suggested that the LRE would make light output increase faster, peak higher and decay more slowly.  These were all qualities which suited us.
Validity of model
Luciferase alone

Luciferase and LRE
