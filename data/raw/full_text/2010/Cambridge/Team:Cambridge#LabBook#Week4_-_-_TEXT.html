7. Experiment: Transformation of TOP10 cc (Ben, Emily, Bill, Hannah, Will & Anja)
Top10 cc taken out of -80°C freezer and tawed on ice. 1ml pipette tip cut with scissors sterilised with ethanol and flamed. Using cut pipette tip ~50μl of TOP10cc were transferred to 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (3x)
2μl of resuspended (in 10μl deionised water) BBa_J13002 (plasmiid with TetR represed PoPs/RIPs generator) was added.
2μl of resuspended (in 10μl deionised water) BBa_I712019 (plasmid with firefly luciferase) was added
1.5μl of pHK724 (plasmid containing lux4 gene) was addded
Ce]]s were held on ice for 30min. Heat shocked for 60s at 42°C (waterbath). As a control TOP10cc that had not been transformed with anything (no plasmid DNA added) were subjected to same treatment (as cells to be transformed). Put on ice for ~2min. Added 250μl pre-wardmed (in 37°C) SOC. Incubated at 37°C for Ph with rotation (Eppendorf tubes---> 12ml falcon tubes, tape over top). Plated 50micorl on pre-warmed (in 37°C incubator) LB agar plates with Amp (with blue L-shaped spreader). Grow colonies overnight at 37°2.
8.Experiment: Set up overnight culture of E.coli/pHK555 (Will & Anja)
Inoculated single bacterial colony (E.coli/pHK555) in 5ml LB in a 12ml falcon tube. Incubated at 37°C with rotation overnight. (Since it was difficult to see the colony sent from Jim Slock, we picked twice from where we anticipated colony to be and set up 2x5ml LB overnight cultures)
9.Experiment: Set up overnight cultures of W3110 hns 93-1, BW25113 Δhns::kan, W3110 hns-205::Tn10 TetR, GM230 hns-205::Tn10 TetR (Ben & Anja)

Followed protocol under 'TOP10 chemically competent cells' from OpenWetware
Competent cells from all 4 different strains taken out of -80°C freezer and thawed on ice. 1ml pipette tips  cut with scissors dipped in ethanol and flamed. For each strain 50μl of cells were transferred to a separate 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. 1μl pUC19 (standard plasmid) was added to each 50μl of cells. Held on ice for 30 min. Heat shocked at 42°C for 60s (water bath). On ice for ~2min. 250μl SOC was added to each of 4 tubes. Each Eppendorf tube was put in a 12ml falcon with tape over the top and incubated at 37°C for 1h with rotation. 20μl of each of the 4 different transformed strains were plated on LB agar plages with Amp. Colonies were grown overnight at 37°C.
14. Experiment: Making competent and transforming E. coli/pHK555 (Peter & Paul)
50μl EZ Comp  buffer transferred to Eppendorf tube and placed on ice. Single E. coli/pHK555 colony resuspended in EZ Comp buffer(2x single colony in 50μl EZ each, 1 streak of colonies in another 50μl EZ). Vortex if needed to suspend clumps. 3μl of pHK724 plasmid added to solution, mixed and incubated on ice for 20 min.
Heaat shocked at 42°C for 90s (water bath). Incubated at RT for 5 min. 1ml LB added. Eppendorf tubes put in 12ml falcon tubes with tape over top. Incubated at 37°C for 1h with rotation. Plated 100μl on LB agar plates with Cm and Amp. Incubated at 30°C for 48h.

It was checked (Nanodrop!) that 2μl of plasmid DNA would not contain more than 1μg of DNA. The reaction mixtures were mixed gently (flick tube) and spun in the microcentrifuge for 15s (13,000 rpm). It was then incubated at 37°C (water bath) for 30 min.
Gel Electrophoresis
An E-gel EX Agarose 1% was mounted on the transilluminator. Nanodrop readings were taken for both restriction enzyme digests:
Plasmid with promoter + rbs: 21.4 ng/μl => 5μl gives 100ng
Plasmid with luciferase: 19.7ng/μl => 5μl gives 100ng
For each digest the following mixture was made up
3μl 6X orange loading Dye

firefly luciferase => 1653b
The plasmid with promoter + rbs as well as te firefly luciferase bands were cut out of the gel (gel cut pipette tips) and DNA was extracted separately from the two gel pieces by following the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol.
Ligation
Fermentas 5X Rapid ligation buffer was taken out of -20°C fridge, thawed and mixed thoroughly prior to use. Nanodrop measurements of the linearised vector DNA as well as the insert DNA were taken:
plasmid with promoter + rbs: 56.8ng/μl
firefly luciferase: 29.6ng/μl
10-100ng of linearised vector DNA should be added to the ligation mix=>1μl. 3:1 molar exess  of insert DNA should be added to the ligation mix.
(56.8ng.2153b) * 1653b * 3 = 131ng => 4.5μl

Took an E. coli/pHK555 and a TOP10/pHK724 colony and separately purified plasmids following the "QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit using a Microcentrifuge" protocol. Nanodrop measurements. TOP10, BW25113 Δhns::kan and GM230 hns-205::Tn10 TetR cells were transformed with both plasmids together and separately. Control cells were left untransformed. Transformation was performed according to the protocol in experiment 18 (instead of ligation reaction, pHK555 (6μl) and pHK724 (7μl) were added to the commp cells. TOP10 cc transformed with both plasmids got 5μl of pHK724 only). Transformed cells were plated on different antibiotic-containing plates as listed in the table below:

No bacteria from any of the three strains took up both plasmids simultaneously, although when both the plasmids were added to a strain simultaneously there was growth on both of the individual resistance plates – i.e. some bacteria had taken up one and some the other but the probability that any would take up both was so low that no colonies were observed on the ChlAmp plate. No bacteria strains were killed by the heat shocking as smears of bacteria were seen on every plate without antibiotics added that also had a transformed strain plated.  The takeup of plasmid 7 was successful in Invitrogen Top 10 strain and in the Red Strain.
In the Black strain, the results from the Black strain are less clear – when we added both plasmids there was no colony growth on the Ampicillin plate (plasmid 7 indicates ampicillin resistance) therefore no plasmid 7 was taken up, however we observed growth on the plate which had been transformed by only plasmid 7 then added to an Amp plate. The colony size was extremely variable though, and although there was no colour differences visible we hypothesise that it may have been contaminated during the procedure.
