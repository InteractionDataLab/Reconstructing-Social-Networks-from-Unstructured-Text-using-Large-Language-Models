Team:Cambridge/emissionEstimationNotes General Notes for emission estimation
From 2010.igem.org
According to "Spectral emission and quantum yield of firefly bioluminescence"(1960) (H. H. Seliger and W. D. McElroy)
1. The emission spectrum of in vitro firefly bioluminescence has been found to be identical with the in vivo bioluminescence.  2. One light quantum is emitted for every luciferin molecule oxidized, the yellowgreen emission band peaking at 562 mμ. 3. A low quantum yield red emission appears in acid pH and at high phosphate buffer concentrations even at neutral pH. 4. An energy stabilization role is postulated for the luciferase molecule in view of the high quantum yields measured.
