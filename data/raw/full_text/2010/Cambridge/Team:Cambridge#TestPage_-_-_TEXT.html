Abstract
We placed genes from fireflies and bioluminescent bacteria into E.coli. Codon optimisation and single amino acid mutagenesis allowed us to generate bright light output in a range of different colours. Future applications include  and quantitative biosensors and biological alternatives to conventional lighting.

We are the  Cambridge Team for iGEM 2010, we are investigating the phenomenon  of bioluminescence in fireflies (Photinus pyralis), Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio harveyi and aiming to transfer one or more of these systems to biobricks.
The aim will be to firstly provide a quantifiable photon output, and secondly to build the foundations for bioluminescent light sources in the future. In addition, we are looking into quiescence as a method to increase output.
Please read our more comprehensive project description for further details.  This page will be updated over the course of the summer as we progress through our project.  If you would like to get in touch with us for any reason, please do email us .
The team - in order - Theo Sanderson, Peter Emmrich, Ben Reeve, Anja Hohmann, Emily Knott, Bill Collins, Paul Masset, Hannah Copley, Will Handley
