Project Firefly: Luciola cruciata
Photinus pyralis ( source )
The Japanese firefly, Luciola cruciata is notable in that nearby fireflies flash in synchrony, making the trees pulsate with green light which fishermen use as a guide to bring them home.  The Cambridge team selected Luciola cruciata because Kajiyama and Nakano (1991) had described a suite of single amino acid changes which significantly changed the wavelength of peak emission.
