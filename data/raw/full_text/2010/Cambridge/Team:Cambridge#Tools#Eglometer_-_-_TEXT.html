Hardware tool: the E.glometer
We designed and built a low cost electronic system for measuring light output, this is useful for reporter assays.
Use of the E.glometer
The user places a culture, or a buffered suspension of cells, in a cuvette
The cuvette is placed against the TAOS chip
The device is turned on, it prompts the user for an exposure time.  The user enters the time in seconds using the numeric keypad and presses "*" when finished
The device waits during a 20 second "priming" phase, this is to allow the user to place it in a dark box or cover it well to prevent background light leakage.
The device counts photons for the period entered, when the time has elapsed it announces this with two beeps.
The number of light units counted is shown on the LCD screen.
Making your own E.glometer
Shopping list
There are three core components to make the light detecting device:
TAOS light to frequency converter - TSL230RP-LF = $6 (or for higher sensitivity TSL237)
Arduino - $25
10 uF capacitor - $0.25
Total - $31.25
E.glometer tested on K325239 induced with 100um arabinose
Together these three (and some jump leads) will let you count photons for a well timed period.  However you will have to connect a laptop both to report the data collected and to change the exposure time.
We wanted to make a self contained device so we added:
A numeric keypad - $4.78
An 8x2 LCD module  - $6.62
A buzzer - to announce completion - $0.80
A breadboard to allow easy assembly of these components: $10
Total - $22.20 extra
Wiring
The diagram above shows the connections that should be made on the breadboard.  Some LCD screens and keypads may have different pin arrangements. As long as the output pins are updated in the Arduino code a number of permutations are possible.
Arduino code
The code below is designed to run the Arduino in standalone mode.  The user enters exposure time, and the Arduino counts photons for this period.

The code above incorporates code from C. Church licensed under a Creative Commons license.
It can be extended to allow data logging to a laptop via serial port, or to display further calculations based on the raw data.
