Bioluminescence: Luciferases
Mutant luciferase (P. pyralis)
Mutant Enhanced Photon Initiating Complex (EPIC) Luciferase (P.pyralis) Sequence
Site-directed mutagenesis of firefly luciferase active site amino acids: a proposed model for bioluminescence color
Improved practical usefulness of firefly luciferase by gene chimerization and random mutagenesis
Other Insect luciferases
For colours we could use the click beetle luciferase red or green . They're only at the 'planning' stage though.

Notes
The lux wiki from parts registry
NCBI Lux operon sequence
parts registry lux operon -currently waiting on an email to see how useful/available this part is
IMPORTANT INFO
The Photorhabdus luminescens luxCDABE operon in the registry. It's not well characterised
Plasmid experiment
Vibrio plasmid experiment -possible source of lux operon
File:4449975.pdf
[1] - Transformation protocol for students from basics - includes several plasmids
Plan
set plasmid 555 into a BioBrick
replace the promoter? sensitivity tuners?

Transformation Experiment to test Firefly luciferase in registry
Firefly luciferase is in the registry as BBa_I712019 , and have been sent to us as part of the spring 2010 distribution.
We need to find a new vector with a bacterial ribosyme binding site, initiator, and a stop codon. Having searched via the catalog in the plasmids section, then in expression plasmids, we have selected a constitutive plasmid:
The plasmid selected is BBa_J13002 , which is a TetR repressed POPS/RIPS generator, again part of the spring 2010 distribution - kit plate 1, well 13B, plasmid pSB1A2. It was proven to work by UMN iGEM 2009.
