Notes on alterations to the SLOCK pHK724 clone
The sequence which SLOCK sent us is just the sequence which is found on NCBI (found by sequence alignment of the two sequences)
We do not know exactly what is in the plasmid, maybe some information can be found in the references here
From the annotated start of the lux ICDABEG operon from NCBI there are no restriction sites in conflict with the BioBrick standards.
Editing ideas:
Remove I and G regions from the operon (are these useful?)
Attach suffices and prefixes
Is this sufficient to then put into a BioBrick? what Chassis should we use?
A good summary of the lux operon with quality references
How to design a RBS
Oligo Order for Vibrio Fischeri on 13.08.10
Oligo Order for Vibrio Fischeri on 17.08.12
Firefly Oligos to be ordered
Mutagenesis Oligos to be ordered before DNA 2.0 comes through
Oligos to biobrick our DNA 2.0 order
Our first attempts at oligo design (a little excessive)
Oligos to BioBrick the whole lux operon (never ordered as too expensive)
