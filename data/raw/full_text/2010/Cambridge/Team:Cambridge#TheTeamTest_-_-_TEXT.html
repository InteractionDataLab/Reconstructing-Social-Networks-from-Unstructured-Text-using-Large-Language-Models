Mission Statement
As a team of scientists and engineers from very diverse backgrounds we aim to create an environment where every member is able to apply his or her unique talents and knowledge to the fullest. We will try to document our literature research and our experimental work on the wiki and the online labbook. We will make new content available as soon as possible. Please excuse it if a poor content organisation arises from this temporarily, we will put it all into a more orderly fashion as soon as we get to it. To make our work more relevant and transparent we will clearly distinguish between theoretical designs, mathematical simulations and physically designed biological systems, and will include measurements where appropriate.
Share and Enjoy
In the Open Source spirit of iGEM, we will try to make our ideas, the progress of our work and our results as open as possible. This requires honesty about which parts of our project succeeded, which yielded ambiguous results and which ideas had to be abandoned. We believe that such transparency will make our project more useful for future iGEM teams and researchers.
We would love to collaborate with other current iGEM teams working on related projects. If you think parts of our work could be useful to you, please get in contact with us and we will see how we can help. Conversely, if you have any resources or knowledge that you believe could help us, please let us know!
Although iGEM takes the form of a competition, all of our work is ultimately a collaboration to create a registry that will act as a firm foundation supporting the scientists and engineers of the future.
