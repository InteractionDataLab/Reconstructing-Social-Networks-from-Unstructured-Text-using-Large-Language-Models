Week 4: Monday 2nd - Sunday 8th August
Monday
We transformed some of the competent TOP10 cells we made the previous week with plasmid phK724, which was kindly  sent to us by Jim Slock
We also placed E. coli containing phK555 in 5ml LB broth in a rotating 37°C incubator to grow up overnight.
In terms of dry work, we discussed what we wanted to have synthesised.  We decided to dismiss PPDK (Pyruvate Orthophosphate Dikinase) and to include the Japanese firefly (Luciola cruciata) because of the ease with which we could change the colour of its emission.
Tuesday
We made cells from 4 different hns mutants: W3110 hns93-1, BW25113 Δhns::kan, W3110 hns-205::Tn10, GM230 hns-205::Tn10.  This was prompted by a paper suggesting increased bioluminescence in strains with reduced hns. These cells were stored at -80°C  for later use
We continued to discuss synthesis requirements
Wednesday
Hannah and Theo tested the previous day's preparations for competence.  Unfortunately they plated out only 20ul, not enough to get sufficient colonies for an accurate perception of competence. Meanwhile, Peter and Paul transformed E.coli containing phK555 with phK724 and placed the cells in a 30C incubator. (V. fischeri lux proteins denature above this temperature)
Bill, Emily, Anja tried to add a prokaryotic RBS and promoter to the firefly luciferase already in the registry.  They performed miniprep and restriction digest then ligation, but used incorrect restriction enzymes, such that we could not exclude religated plasmid backbones.
Thursday
Results
GM230 hns-205 ::Tn10 TetR (black) - somewhat competent
W3110 hns 93-1 (blue) - no transformants
BW25113 Δ  hns ::kan (red) - somewhat
W3110 hns-205::Tn10 TetR - no tansformants
Theo's plan
Miniprep plasmid DNA from luciferase and backbone transformed TOP10 following Qiagen protocol
Digest luciferase Biobrick with: XbaI, PstI to produce two fragments:
P end---old backbone---E--Xend
Xend--luciferase---S--Pend (desired)
Digest backbone Biobrick with SpeI, PstI to produce:
Send--short fragment--Pend
Pend---backbone--E--X--promoter--RBS--Send (desired)
Run both digest products on a gel
Extract suitable lengthed fragments from gel:
Promoter + backbone should be 2153 bp
Luciferase should be 1653 bp (its 3426 bp backbone should be discarded)
Perform ligation
S and X are compatible so we get
Pend---backbone--E--X--promoter--RBS--SXscar--luciferase---S--Pend
The two Pends will also ligate, producing a circular desired plasmid
Transform competent TOP10 cells with ligation product
What happened
In the morning we were a bit disconsolate because there was nothing visible on the plates containing phK724 and phK555, and our transformation tests for the variant hns strains were less successful than we had hoped.
However our mood changed when Jim A told us we could not hope for many transformants with 20ul of strains that were not TOP10.  We decided to retest the strains with 100 ul plated out.{{
AND we checked the 30 C incubator again and saw 2 colonies on one of the pHK555 plates, viewed under the camera they were clearly glowing so we gathered in the cold room and passed them around, as our eyes adapted we saw the colonies.  We even saw a third glowing colony which we had not spotted on the plate.
Friday
Ligation appeared to have failed. Jim A suggests that we heat to 65 degrees to melt short DNAs after restriction digest, plus that we clean up the DNA with a spin column without gel.
PM
Hannah and Theo transformed TOP10, red, and black containing phK555 with pHK724 using Jim Slock's EZ Competence buffer
Anja, Emily drew out various things on petri dishes.
Set off for trip to lake district
Saturday
We spent the day in the Lake District, a beautiful part of the UK 250 miles North of Cambridge.
Sunday
Went in to the lab on return: Found that:
TOP10 containing 5/7 (Theo&Hannah, Friday) had been successfully transformed, glowing
There were some colonies growing on ligation plate
Logos were mostly dim, except at the edges (weekend incubation too long)
Theo and Peter:
Redrew logos from *very* turbid liquid culture of pHK555/724
Prepared overnight cultures of:
Two hns strains (details?)
The potential ligations
The firely luciferase, and backbones, for miniprep if necessary
+ made up the 5mlsish of LB with pHK555/724 (Slock's strain) with 200ml LB
Monday
7. Experiment: Transformation of TOP10 cc (Ben, Emily, Bill, Hannah, Will & Anja)
Top10 cc taken out of -80°C freezer and tawed on ice. 1ml pipette tip cut with scissors sterilised with ethanol and flamed. Using cut pipette tip ~50μl of TOP10cc were transferred to 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (3x)
2μl of resuspended (in 10μl deionised water) BBa_J13002 (plasmiid with TetR represed PoPs/RIPs generator) was added.
2μl of resuspended (in 10μl deionised water) BBa_I712019 (plasmid with firefly luciferase) was added
1.5μl of pHK724 (plasmid containing lux4 gene) was addded
Ce]]s were held on ice for 30min. Heat shocked for 60s at 42°C (waterbath). As a control TOP10cc that had not been transformed with anything (no plasmid DNA added) were subjected to same treatment (as cells to be transformed). Put on ice for ~2min. Added 250μl pre-wardmed (in 37°C) SOC. Incubated at 37°C for Ph with rotation (Eppendorf tubes---> 12ml falcon tubes, tape over top). Plated 50micorl on pre-warmed (in 37°C incubator) LB agar plates with Amp (with blue L-shaped spreader). Grow colonies overnight at 37°2.
8.Experiment: Set up overnight culture of E.coli/pHK555 (Will & Anja)
Inoculated single bacterial colony (E.coli/pHK555) in 5ml LB in a 12ml falcon tube. Incubated at 37°C with rotation overnight. (Since it was difficult to see the colony sent from Jim Slock, we picked twice from where we anticipated colony to be and set up 2x5ml LB overnight cultures)
9.Experiment: Set up overnight cultures of W3110 hns 93-1, BW25113 Δhns::kan, W3110 hns-205::Tn10 TetR, GM230 hns-205::Tn10 TetR (Ben & Anja)

It was checked (Nanodrop!) that 2μl of plasmid DNA would not contain more than 1μg of DNA. The reaction mixtures were mixed gently (flick tube) and spun in the microcentrifuge for 15s (13,000 rpm). It was then incubated at 37°C (water bath) for 30 min.
Gel Electrophoresis
An E-gel EX Agarose 1% was mounted on the transilluminator. Nanodrop readings were taken for both restriction enzyme digests:
Plasmid with promoter + rbs: 21.4 ng/μl => 5μl gives 100ng
Plasmid with luciferase: 19.7ng/μl => 5μl gives 100ng
For each digest the following mixture was made up
3μl 6X orange loading Dye

Took an E. coli/pHK555 and a TOP10/pHK724 colony and separately purified plasmids following the "QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit using a Microcentrifuge" protocol. Nanodrop measurements. TOP10, BW25113 Δhns::kan and GM230 hns-205::Tn10 TetR cells were transformed with both plasmids together and separately. Control cells were left untransformed. Transformation was performed according to the protocol in experiment 18 (instead of ligation reaction, pHK555 (6μl) and pHK724 (7μl) were added to the commp cells. TOP10 cc transformed with both plasmids got 5μl of pHK724 only). Transformed cells were plated on different antibiotic-containing plates as listed in the table below:

No bacteria from any of the three strains took up both plasmids simultaneously, although when both the plasmids were added to a strain simultaneously there was growth on both of the individual resistance plates – i.e. some bacteria had taken up one and some the other but the probability that any would take up both was so low that no colonies were observed on the ChlAmp plate. No bacteria strains were killed by the heat shocking as smears of bacteria were seen on every plate without antibiotics added that also had a transformed strain plated.  The takeup of plasmid 7 was successful in Invitrogen Top 10 strain and in the Red Strain.
In the Black strain, the results from the Black strain are less clear – when we added both plasmids there was no colony growth on the Ampicillin plate (plasmid 7 indicates ampicillin resistance) therefore no plasmid 7 was taken up, however we observed growth on the plate which had been transformed by only plasmid 7 then added to an Amp plate. The colony size was extremely variable though, and although there was no colour differences visible we hypothesise that it may have been contaminated during the procedure.
