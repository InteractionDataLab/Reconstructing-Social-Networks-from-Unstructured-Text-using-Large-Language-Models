Project Firefly: Photinus pyralis
Photinus pyralis ( source )
The luciferase of the North American firefly, P. pyralis, is a tried and tested mechanism for creating bioluminescence.  We were aware that a luciferase from this organism was already present in the registry ( BBa_I712019 ).  We wanted to improve on this by three techniques:
Codon optimisation for expression in E. coli to increase the rate of translation
Using a mutant with increased substrate affinity
Parallel use of the Photinus pyralis luciferin regenerating enzyme to both relieve inhibition by oxyluciferin and increase availability of luciferin.
