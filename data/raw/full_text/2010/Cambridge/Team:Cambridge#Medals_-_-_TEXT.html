Medals
iGEM 2010 will award medals.  All teams can earn models.  There are three levels of medals, from lowest to highest:
Bronze Medal
Silver Medal
Gold Medal
The requirements to earn a Bronze Medal are:
Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit a Project Summary form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki (see TUDelft 2008 for a great example).
Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree (watch the Heidelberg 2008 video for a great example).
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Parts
Entered information for each new part or device should at least include primary nucleic acid sequence, description of function, authorship, any relevant safety notes, and an acknowledgement of sources and references.  Consider BBa_J45004 as one example (be sure to check Main, Design Page, and Experiences sub-pages for this part).
Teams are currently expected to design and contribute standard biological parts that conform to the accepted BioBrick standards for physical assembly. Non-BioBrick parts will not be recognized by iGEM 2010 judges unless they have specific approval .  The two specific BioBrick physical assembly schemes that the judges will recognize by default are (i) Tom Knight's original assembly standard and (ii) Ira Phillips fusion assembly standard .
[Special Note.  A discussion has been initiated by the BioBricks Standards Working Group to consider updating the BioBrick assembly standard in time for June 1.  Check back for any updates on acceptable BioBrick assembly standards.]
Any new Devices that are based on gene expression are expected to conform to the PoPS device boundary standard.  See chapter 3 of the book, Adventures in Synthetic Biology , for more information about common signal carriers and PoPS.
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry of Parts.
The submitted DNA must be associated with a Part or Device for which you have entered information describing the part or device, and must conform to the BioBrick standards for Parts or Devices (see above).
The requirements to earn a Silver Medal, in addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, are:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on the Parts or Device page via the Registry of Parts (see BBa_F2620 for an exemplar).
The requirements to earn a Gold Medal, in addition to the Silver Medal requirements, are any one OR more of the following:
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the (i) design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (ii) construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (iii) characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (iv) analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (v) sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
