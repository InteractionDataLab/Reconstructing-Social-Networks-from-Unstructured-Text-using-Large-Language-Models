Bioluminescence
We aim to produce a strain of bacteria that can produce a sustained and visible to the human eye light output. We have two aims in mind:
Luciferase assays
Luciferase is commonly used as an assay. However, the substrate luciferin is extremely expensive, and the light output is transient and very dim, often requiring expensive equipment and a dark room. If we can up the light output such that it is visible to the human eye, whilst a dark room would still be helpful to eliminate noise, more conventional CCDs can be used to detect light levels. We would also fill in some of the light producing cycle such that CHBT, a chemical about 50 times cheaper than luciferin, could be added and recycled so a sustained light output is possible.
Lighting
Ideally we will be able to increase the efficiency of the luciferase reaction such that not only is the reaction visible to the human eye, but enough to illuminate with sufficient quantity of bacteria. Having optimised the system in bacteria and completed the luciferin cycle, we would attempt to transfer this system into plants for use on highways and in homes.
