Peter Zhu Is a sophomore at Duke University and a North Carolina local. Though he's not completely sure yet what to do with his life, he is leaning more and more towards Biomedical Engineering and pre-Law. When he's not busy with the routines of life, he is listening to the Billboard Top 100, playing Chopin Preludes, searching for new places to eat, playing tennis, studying poker, and gaming Starcraft/DoTA. Peter is a regular at Bail Hai Mongolian Grill, Lime and Basil Vietnamese Pho, and Five Guy's Burgers---bacon cheeseburger with all toppings of course.
Peter is also a philosophical person and is very much interested in the philosophies of man (as demonstrated from his staring philosophically into the sea in this picture.)
