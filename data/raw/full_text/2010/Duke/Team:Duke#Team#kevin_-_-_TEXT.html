Kevin Chien is a sophmore at duke, majoring in Biomedical Engineering. Currently, he is on the premed track (like everyone else in BME).  However, he wants to explore his options in many different careers. He occasionally plays ultimate frisbee and is interested in many different areas of knowledge, ranging from Astrophysics to political science. He worked on this iGEM team last year as well and enjoyed his stay in Boston(hopes to have a good one this year too!).
