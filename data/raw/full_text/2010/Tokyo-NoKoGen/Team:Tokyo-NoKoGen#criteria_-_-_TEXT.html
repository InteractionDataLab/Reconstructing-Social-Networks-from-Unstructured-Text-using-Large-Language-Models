Project Name:
An EcoTanker for the easy collection and delivery of target compounds
Project Abstract:
We propose an entirely new Escherichia coli micro machine that behaves like a tanker, the EcoTanker. The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.

iGEM Medals
We believe our team deserves the following medal:
Bronze
Silver
Gold
Because we met the following criteria (check all that apply and provide     details where needed)
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2010 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
Enter this information and other documentation on both the iGEM 2010 wiki and the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K317024 , BBa_K317026 , BBa_K317040 , BBa_K317028
iGEM Wiki Page Name: Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/Project/aggregation , Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/Project/lysis , Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/Project/phototaxis
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K112808
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Link to this information on your wiki. Page name: Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/criteria/collaboration
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the: (check all that apply)
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or via the Internet
Please provide the BBF RFC number for your standard:
Please check the wiki page 'https://2010.igem.org/Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/criteria/new_technical_standard'. Our several parts were constructed with overlap extention PCR method to reduce the time for assembly.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for prizes in their track, the grand prize, and for special prizes. The special prizes include Best Wiki, Best Poster, Best Presentation, Best New BioBrick Part (Natural or Engineered). To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance
Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these three special prizes:
Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Part Number(s): BBa_K317024 , BBa_K317040 , BBa_K317028
Your team has listed these parts as your team favorites:
iGEM Safety
For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
The iGEM judges expect that you have answered the four safety questions ( Safety page ) on your iGEM 2010 wiki.
Please provide the link to that page:
Page name: Team:Tokyo-NoKoGen/safety
Attribution and Contributions
For iGEM 2010 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.
Please provide the link to that page:
