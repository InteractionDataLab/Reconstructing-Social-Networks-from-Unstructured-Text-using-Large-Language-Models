[solubilization]
Culturing of pseudomonas aeruginosa
TA cloning of RhlA and RhlB genes from pseudomonas aeruginosa
[Tank]
Purchased Citrobacter freundii (Braak1928) Werkman and Gillen 1932

August 9 - August 15
[Tank]
The PCR product (pduAB, pduJK, pduN, pduU) were inserted into pSB vector.

Colony PCR was carried out to confirm the constructions.
Extraction of plasmids.
Sequence analysis of cloned genes
・Analyzed the sequence of last-week extracted plasmids
・pduAB, pduN and pduU were almost same as the sequence registered in EMBL Nuceotide Sequence Database (accession number AM498294) ・pduJK had a little different sequence from the sequence of AM498294.We thought that the difference might be due to the difference between species; C.freundii and registered one.

・Subcloning of iron peptide-cording gene
(We amplified the gene cording C-terminus of alpha-synuclein with iron-binding capacity by PCR from pET28a having alpha-synuclein gene and. For subcloning we used Primers that contained NcoI or XhoI site. The PCR product with NcoI and XhoI site was confirmed by electrophoresis and purified from agarose gel.)
・Insertion of iron-binding peptide gene into pET28a vector
・Plasmid extraction and transformation of BL21(DE3)
・Measurement of iron-binding function
The cells were disrupted by sonication. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 G for 20 min and corrected the supernatant. We measured Fe (III) concentration in the supernatant by color reaction using 1, 10- phenanthroline which is chelating agent of iron ion. When 1, 10- phenanthroline chelate iron ion, the absorbance at 510 nm increases.  Expression of iron-binding peptide was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. We also carried out same experiments against cells transformed by pET28a as a control.
As a result of comparison with control cells, iron ion concentration in the supernatant did not change. Expression of iron-binding peptide was also failed.
