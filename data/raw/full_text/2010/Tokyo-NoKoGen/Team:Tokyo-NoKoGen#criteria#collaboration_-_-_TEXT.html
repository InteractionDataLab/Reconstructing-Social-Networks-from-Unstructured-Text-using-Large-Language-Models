New method
We Tokyo-NoKoGen take part in "iGEM Japan" which consist of Japanese iGEM teams. iGEM Japan is a organization which compete with each other for iGEM’s activity. For example, we talk about iGEM projects to make projects better. Aiming at making iGEM popular in Japan, we contribute an article to a science journal, incu-be, and translate the iGEM2010 project abstract in Japanese.
We also collaborate with METU_Turkey_Software Team by responding survey.
They are effort to develop new standards for Parts Registry and user-friendly Part Registry Forms and Parts Entry pages.
We tried to contribute to make iGEM popular and activation by taking part in iGEM Japan and collaborating with other teams as discussed above.
