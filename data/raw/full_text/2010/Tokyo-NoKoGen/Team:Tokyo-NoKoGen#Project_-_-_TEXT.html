Our project:EcoTanker
Eco Tanker is a valuable and useful tool which is able to collect target subject, easily.
First, Eco Tanker is able to bring in target subject, and then Tank in Eco Tanker take in and concentrate it. Next, the E.coli including the tanks filled in the subject gather together and aggregates by several light stimulation. Finally, E. coli is automatically lysed by aggregation. We expect Eco Tanker as the tool of resource recovery and the means to remove the contaminant.
Ecotanker is composed of seven devices.
Those are ①SOLUBILIZATION , ②UPTAKE , ③TANK , ④PHOTOTAXIS , ⑤AGGREGATION , ⑥PHOTOCONTROL , and ⑦LYSIS .
SOLUBILIZATION device is to solubilize target subject easily. UPTAKE device capture the target substance in the tank. TANK device is a system to make a tank for collecting a target substance. PHOTOTAXIS device collects E. coli to a specific location.  AGGREGATION device lets together and aggregate E.coli. PHOTOCONTROL device controls the AGGEIGATION by using light. LYSIS device extracts the tank from E.coli.
