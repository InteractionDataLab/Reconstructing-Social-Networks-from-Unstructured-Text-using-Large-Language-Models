Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No, they don't. Our project worked with biosafty level 1 or 2 host organism. And our laboratory has proper facility for use level 2 host organism.
Then, our ideas don’t raise any safety issues.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, they don’t. We used genes analyzed in peer-reviewed papers.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, there is. There is the committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology , and we followed their safety guidelines and regulations.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
To share the information about the experience of potentially serious errors in our experiment is important. When we share that, we can be aware of and attend to risk factors in our experiment. Moreover, that leads to prevention of happening and errors. Moreover, we accustom ourselves to have discussion within report and discuss serious errors and potential dangerous by every week.
This is an example of a poster affixed to our laboratory.
As written on this poster, we are conducting experiments safely with care!
(This poster says "Don't do experiments without wearing protective goggles".)
