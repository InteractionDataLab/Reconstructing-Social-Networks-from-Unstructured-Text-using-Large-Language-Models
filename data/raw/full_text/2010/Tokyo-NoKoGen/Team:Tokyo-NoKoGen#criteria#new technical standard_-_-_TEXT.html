New method
Here, we propose new method for synthesize your favorite plasmid.
It should be useful to study synthetic biology and to take part in iGEM team!!
Overlap extension
In 3A assembly, it takes two days at least that construction of the gene composed of two genes(Fig.1).
In our project, we performed “overlap extension PCR” to construction of the gene composed of more than two genes. In overlap extension PCR, most important thing is designing the primer. We design the primer which is not only hybridization with one gene, but also another gene which we want to connect. This method enables to connect more than two genes by only twice PCR in a day (Fig.2).
In our project, this method enables us to constructs to Eco-Tank and phototaxis device for a brief time.
