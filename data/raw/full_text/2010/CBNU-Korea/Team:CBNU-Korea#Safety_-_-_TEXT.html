Cloning that is one of most important experiment technique in molecular biology is method that amplified and makes usable the number when need gene wanting while kept long term. To be used most among a lot of kinds of bacteria is E.coli. E.coli secures relatively because disease producing is weak even if is caught to a person, and much studied bacteria are E.coli. This is the reason we used E.coli in this experiment.
Genes in vector are similar with E.coli by V.cholerae chromosomeⅡ. Therefore, because minimal genome that is made like this is similar with E.coli minimal genome, is harmless.
