  Synthetic  minimal genome is the smallest possible group of genes that would be sufficient  to sustain a cellular life form under the most favorable conditions imaginable  that working like natural chromosome, bacteria have. For synthesizing minimal  genome, there are many things that we have to consider such as kind of genes,  gene arrangement, direction of genes, codon usage, genome structure, stability  and so on. Therefore it is very difficult to synthesize minimal genome  considering ALL of these. So we synthesize simple minimal chromosome employing <EM>V.cholerae</EM> O1 biovar eltor str. N16961chromosome II replication and partition  system as the first step of synthetic minimal genome. Also, we re-build essential  gene database from DEG and NCBI. And using this database, we build genome  designer easy to design, too.</P><P><STRONG>Approach  1: Replication and Partition system of <EM>V.  cholerae</EM></STRONG>
  In <EM>Vibrio cholerae</EM>, there are two circular  chromosomes, chromosome I(2.96Mb) and chromosome II(1.07Mb), and each perfectly  works as a chromosome. Because chromosome II has different replication protein  from main chromosome (chromosome I), RctA and RctB. Also chromosome replication  origin structure is different each other. Replication origin of chrI(  chromosome I ), <EM>oriC1vc</EM> is similar in  sequence to the origin of replication of the <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> chromosome, <EM>oriC.</EM><EM>oriC2vc</EM> has very little similarity to <EM>oriC1vc</EM>. <EM>oriC2vc</EM> has plasmid-like feature(sequences resembling iterons)(Egan  and Waldor 2003 and Vendoka-Canova et al 2006). </P><P>Fig. 1. Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar eltor str. N16961 recombinant structure of oriC2vc</P><P> </P><P> The  two genes <EM>rctA</EM> and <EM>rctB</EM> flanking <EM>oriC2vc</EM> are so far known unique to replication in the Vibrio family(  Egan et al, 2006). The <EM>rctA</EM> gene is  not actually protein coding gene. It codes of an untranslated RNA and acts as a  DNA to inhibit <EM>oriC2vc</EM> function by  binding RctB. RctA is not conserved in other vibrio(Venkova-Canova et al 2006).  RctB is initiator protein of <EM>V.cholerae</EM> chrII replication. The RctB protein binds to disparate specific DNA sequences,  which gives RctB multiple functions. Also this initiator protein regulates the  transcription of <EM>rctA</EM> and <EM>rctB</EM>. RctB acts an autorepressor  repressing its own transcription as well as <EM>rctA</EM>.  RctB promoter activity is autoregulated by RctB. Also,  we searched some articles to study. According to article about replication of <EM>V.cholerae, </EM>RctB protein is needed to  start replication as initiator. So that research has two vectors. First one includes  oriC2vc and another one has pBAD+rctB for start rctB replication system. So, we  make synthetic promoter and insert it into <EM>oriC2vc, </EM>upstream of <EM>rctB</EM> gene. PrctB(syn)  have R13 that repeat sequence essential for replication. But PrctB(syn) have strong  promoter from E.coli sigma70 factor. And have strong SD sequence. PrctB (syn) for the minimal chromosome  replication initiation and chromosome RctB will allow themselves could create.Also, we searched some articles to study.

  Partition of <EM>V.cholerae</EM> chrII is accomplished by <EM>parA, parB</EM> and parB binding site <EM>parS. </EM>Partitioning  genes(par genes) have been known to play an essential role in the stable  inheritance of certain plasmids. ParB proteins bind to their cognate <EM>pars</EM> sites and form ParB-<EM>parS </EM>nucleoprotein complex. Then, ParA  protein interacts with the ParB-<EM>parS</EM> complex and their ATPase activity is essential for partitioning. Still, the  molecular mechanism by which the interaction of ParA with the ParB-<EM>parS</EM> mediates localization and  partitioning are not well understood. </P><P>Fig. 2.
