5/7
Membership meeting
New  participant of CBNU-KOREA team.
Introduced  what is the iGEM, what we should do if we join the competition.
5/15
Concept meeting
Decided  2010 CBNU-KOREA iGEM team’s project(almost 4hr)
5/18
Researching
Finding  related articles, paper and so on.
Essential  gene data search
5/25
Strategy about database
Planned  how to re-construct essential gene database.
5/27
Gathering
Gathering  the essential genes data from DEG, NCBI.
Starting  to lean about experimental technique.
6/1
Clean  up the lab room. Too dirty…
Computer  engineering department meeting about project
6/24
Summer  iGEM Workshop Asia
7/19
Plasmid  Culture
· Pick up a single colony from fresh cultured LB agar plate.
· Our established media and inoculate the cell into the 5ml of fresh  LB liquid media (contains antibiotics) and our established media at 37℃ with shaking for 12hr.
· plasmid : pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1T3, pSB1K3 (contain J54450)
7/20
Plasmid  extract
· Uses kit and extracted plasmid. (pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1T3, pSB1K3)
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
7/23
Plasmid  Digest
· Digest of 4 plasmid.
· Used EcoRⅠ-PstⅠ  restriction endonuclease.
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
7/24
Primer  Design
· Designed Vibrio cholerae's oriC2vc, parA, parB, parS, dif gene primer using ‘Ginko primer’.
7/28
DNA  Amplification
· Amplified ori, parA, parB,  parS, dif gene of vibrio cholerae.
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis. And that’s correct.
Concentration
· Because concentration of parS,  dif gene was low, it was hard to confirm result by electrophoresis.
· Concentrated gene sample
7/29
DNA(gene)  Digest
· Digest of 4 plasmid.
· Used EcoRⅠ-PstⅠ  restriction endonuclease.
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
7/30
Prepared  Compentent cell
· E.coli DH10B, DH5α, JM109
8/2
DNA  Ligation/Transformation
· Ligation inserting gene in vector
(parA+pSB1A3, parS+pSB1C3, ori+pSB1K3, dif+pSB1A3)
· Transformation (Competent cell : E.coli DH10B)
· Spreading on plate (each antibiotics contained LB agar media)
8/3
Cell  Culture
· Pick up a single colony from fresh cultured LB agar plate.
· Our established media and inoculate the cell into the 5ml of fresh  LB liquid media (contains antibiotics) and our established media at 37℃ with shaking for 12hr.
· vector : parA+pSB1A3, parS+pSB1C3, ori+pSB1K3, dif+pSB1A3
8/4
Vector  extract
· Uses kit and extracted plasmid.
(parA+pSB1A3,  parS+pSB1C3, ori+pSB1K3, dif+pSB1A3)
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
8/9
Plasmid  Digest
· Digest of 4 vector.
· ori+pSB1K3, parA+pSB1A3, parS+pSB1C3 digests by EcoRⅠ-SpeⅠ restriction endonuclease and  dif+pSB1A3 gene digested by XbaⅠ-PstⅠ restriction endonuclease.
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
· Came out as size of ori+pSB1K3  gene is smaller.
8/10
Sequencing  Order
· Analyzed plasmid DNA extraction (cultured cell)
8/16
Primer  Again design
· According to analysis result, primer of ori gene knew wrong fact.
· Designed primer of ori gene again.
· Primer of I51020 and p1003 designed.
8/20
DNA  Amplification
· Amplified I51020, p1003
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
8/23
Plasmid  Digest
· I51020 digests by EcoRⅠ-PstⅠ restriction endonuclease.
· p1003 digests by XbaⅠ-PstⅠ restriction endonuclease.
· Confirmed size by electrophoresis.
8/24
DNA  Ligation/Transformation
· Ligated inserting gene in vector
(Inserted ori gene and p1003 antibiotic  resistance cassette in I51020 vector, inserted parS gene and dif gene in  pSB1A3 vector)
· Transformation (Competent cell : E.coli DH10B)
· Spreading on plate (each antibiotics contained LB agar media)
8/25
I51020 transformation failed
