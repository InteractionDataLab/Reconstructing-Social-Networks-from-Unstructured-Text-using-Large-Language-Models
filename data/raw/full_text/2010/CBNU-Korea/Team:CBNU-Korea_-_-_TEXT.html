2010 CBNU-KOREA iGEM team’s final goal is  minimal genome synthesis and synthetic cell.
But synthesizing all these is very  complicate and too many things we have to know.
For example, thing like how to  decide genes to organize and arrange in minimal genome or select what kind of  genes we use.
So, as the first step of our ultimate goal, we synthesized  minimal chromosome.
In  order to synthesize the minimal chromosome, we used some essential genes,  particular sites
and origin of V.cholerae O1 biovar eltor str. N16961 chromosome II, parA,  parB, rctA, rctB protein coding genes,parS,  dif sites
and origin. For confirming it’s function is working well, we  employ GFP protein and fusion to ParB protein and then observe fluorescence  microscope.
Also,  we reconstruct essential gene database from DEG and NCBI.
And we make Genome  Designer using this reconstructed database and add it to Artemis’s DNADraw.
