Re-Construct  Essential Database and using program
 Concept : For  gathering data(GENE ID, COG) that is already known, we took genes information from  DEG web site and mapping with NCBI gene date. Then, we linkaged the related  data with existing gb database, and added this to DNA Draw of Artemis. So, It  can draw essential genes with right color and delete blank between genes. It is  the Genome Designer.
The  first opening file method is the same Artemis file opening procedure. So it  draws genes that we selected when we open gb data files. And click the newly added  function which draws the essential gene, if gene id in gb database is match with  gene id in essential gene database, it draw the gene with assigned color.
This program is developed using  Eclipse(Galileo) and Java(JDK1.6).

Program  development method flow
 Reading gb file in Artemis – DNA Draw operate –  get gene id in gb – matching it with gene id in essential gene database –  indication positive matching result – searching the matched gene id into  essential database  – getting information  about assigned color – show on the monitor
