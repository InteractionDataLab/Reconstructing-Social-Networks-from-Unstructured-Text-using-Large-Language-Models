It is the first time the Chinese University of Hong Kong participates in the resounding iGEM competition. We are delighted to form a team comprising of ten undergraduates, majoring in Biochemistry and Food and Nutritional Science, from the School of Life Science. We also have a spate of advisors to guide the undergraduates throughout the project.
