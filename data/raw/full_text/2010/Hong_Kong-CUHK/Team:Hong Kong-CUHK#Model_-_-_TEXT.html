Modeling
To demonstrate how effective our massively parallel encrypted data storage, we have made a simulation program. Please input your desired text message in the first text box. The length of encoded message, as well as the minimum number of bacteria required to store the whole message will be calculated. For example, the Declaration of Independence requires minimum 18 bacteria (insert size=1000) to store completely.
Source code is available upon request. Please contact Allen through email: cuhk-igem-2010[at]googlegroups.com
