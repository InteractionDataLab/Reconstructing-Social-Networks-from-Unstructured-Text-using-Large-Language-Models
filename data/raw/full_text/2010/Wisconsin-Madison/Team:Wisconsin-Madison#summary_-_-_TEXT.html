1 Enzyme Treatment
Enzyme Treatment
Our major goals for this project were:
1) Design new methods and improve upon old methods for E. coli encapsulation to increase acid survivability.
2) Create a system for timed lysis in the small intestine after experiencing stomach conditions:
Bile promoter system
pH sensitive/inducible repressible promoter system
Encryption construct
This year, a system was designed for delivery of peptides to the small intestine.  Further characterization of past iGEM parts for colanic acid synthesis was completed in the form of biochemical assay and survivability tests.  Both demonstrated the efficacy of the RcsB construct in rescue of growth in acidic situations relevant to survival through the stomach. Characterization of the novel biobrick gadA genes was undertaken, and induction was shown at stationary phase of growth.  An encryption system was designed and cloned.  The groundwork for lysis induced by bile salts was also developed.
We encourage future teams to continue our project. Feel free to contact us. Find our contact information under the team profiles.
