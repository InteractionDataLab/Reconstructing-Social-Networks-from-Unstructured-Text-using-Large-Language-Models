Major Accomplishments
Discovered flaw in pBAD35BB:
PstI cut site in inactive
Sequencing data shows that the PstI cutsite is missing a single basepair
Completed new pBAD35BB
No point mutation is required for pBAD33BB:
Extra EcoRI cut site in inactive in both the original 33 and our biobrick version
Q: Do you know anything about a point mutation your lab did or why this is? (DamI methylation?)
New and complete planning of cloning, experiments and parts: Project Plan

Alkaline Lysis and Digestion of RcsB:pBAD18BB - WRONG
this is odd: colony PCR said otherwise
