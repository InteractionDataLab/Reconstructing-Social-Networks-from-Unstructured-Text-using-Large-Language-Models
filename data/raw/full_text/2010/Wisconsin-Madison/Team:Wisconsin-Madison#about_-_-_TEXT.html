What is iGEM?
iGEM stands for international Genetic Engineering Machine and is a contest held by MIT
Student teams are given a kit of biological parts (DNA) at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. Teams present their work at the iGEM Jamboree held each year on MITs campus in Cambridge, MA and compete for awards in several categories including energy, health/medicine, and food.

What is Synthetic Biology?
iGEM addresses the following questions:
Can simple biological systems be built from standard,
interchangeable parts and operated in living cells?
Or
Is biology simply too complicated to be engineered in the way that
mechanical and electrical systems are designed and constructed?
The answer is that biological systems CAN be built from standard parts! This is an approach to genetic engineering called Synthetic Biology. The primary objective of this field is to abstract the long, complicated sequences of nucleotides found in the DNA of cells into higher order 'interchangeable parts'. Just as you can piece together a computer, scientists want to piece together biological components to create living machines. Synthetic biology also encompasses the creation of standards for these parts.
This field is young and has great potential for both solving some of the most impending problems of our time and the potential for substantial misuse. With such a promising technology it is very important that safety guidelines are followed to prevent the latter.

What is lab-work like?
This clip can give you a glimpse of the wetlab side of iGEM or biological engineering experimentation in general. The Wisconsin-Madison iGEM Team will be featured in an upcoming documentary called SynBio. The documentary will try to evaluate the emerging field of Synthetic Biology and explain the major goals of the field to the general public! Here is a teaser trailer of the Wisconsin iGEM Team.  The other half of our time on iGEM is devoted to research and analysis!
