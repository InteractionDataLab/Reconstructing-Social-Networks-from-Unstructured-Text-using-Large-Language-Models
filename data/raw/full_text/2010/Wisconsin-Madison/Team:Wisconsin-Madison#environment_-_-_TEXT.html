Engineering Hall
Engineering Hall is commonly referred to as EHall on campus. It is host to a wide array of engineering classes and labs. The mall in front of the building is popular hang out area for engineering students. The Wisconsin iGEM Team maintains their own lab in this building.
University of Wisconsin-Madison
The UW-Madison campus is settled in the downtown area of Madison, Wisconsin and wedged between the two glacial lakes Mendota and Monona. Madison enrolls 42,000 students and is one of the USs largest scientific research schools. As a member of the Big Ten Conference, we like (American) football. Learn more about our university at our  Wikipedia Page.
Our school is privileged to have James Thomson on campus as a professor and researcher. In 1998, Thomson was the first to isolate and culture human embryonic stem cells and has been on the forefront of development in the field ever since. Have you ever read The Onion? The Onion was founded by Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson, two UW-Madison students, in 1988. Watch and read funny and satirical (fake) news on their website.
School Spirit
Two students decided to make a music video about our school!
