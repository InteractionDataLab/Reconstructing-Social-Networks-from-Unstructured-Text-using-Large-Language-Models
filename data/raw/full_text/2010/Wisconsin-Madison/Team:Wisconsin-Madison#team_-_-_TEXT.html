Team Members
Peter Culviner
Peter is a senior majoring in biochemistry and Chinese. His major interests are in regulation of gene expression and protein folding. This is his first year on the team.
Nathaniel Pantalone
Nate is a senior in Chemical Engineering.  This is his second year on the team.  After graduating he plans on taking over the world through an elaborate series of plans.  Ask him about it.  He also enjoys all different types of music, from John Coltrane to Social Distortion.
Sarah Sandock
Sarah is a junior in Biomedical Engineering and is specializing in Tissue Engineering. She is minoring in Japanese and enjoys sneaking into ceramic classes. Her research interests lie in bioengineering and mirco-systems. This is her second year on Wisconsin's Team.
Mary Sagstetter
I am a senior at University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Microbiology and Life Science Communication. My research interest is in applying microbiology to public health related fields such as monitoring antibiotic resistance in a waste water treatment plant. I have also written science articles for the college newspaper that pertain to student health issues and research around the campus.  This is my first year on the iGEM team. Fun Fact: The picture was taken at the hockey rink inside Camp Randall.
Justin Vrana
Justin is a senior in Chemistry, Philosophy, and Computer Science. His interests include genomics and single-molecule reaction engineering and analysis (visit LMCG ). This is his first year on the team.
Yue Wu
Yue is a junior in Chemical and Biological Engineering. His interest lies on Energy and Sustainability, particularly in the petroleum industry. He also enjoys traveling with his Nikon camera. He has started his world traveling plan since August, 2008, and now he has been to more than 13 countries covered 4 continents (so talk to him if you are a traveler as well; he would love to share his traveling experiences with you). This is his first year on Wisconsin's Team.
Volunteers
Nate Cira
Nate is a senior majoring in Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, and Biology.  He loves designing devices that involve biology and fluids on the micro scale.  He also has an interest in sustainability, and maintains an active vermicompost and aquaponics system.  This is his second year with the team.
Mike Schwartz
I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in chemical and biological engineering, and I will graduate in May of 2011.  I began volunteering for our school's iGEM team this past summer, and I am currently continuing to do so.  iGEM has been a great experience, as I have never gained so much knowledge in such a short time through a hands-on approach.
