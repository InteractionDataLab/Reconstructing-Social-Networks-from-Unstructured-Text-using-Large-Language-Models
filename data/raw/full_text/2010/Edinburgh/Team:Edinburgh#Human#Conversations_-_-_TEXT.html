Conversations
These conversations were designed to encourage self-reflection and analysis of things we may take for granted. This creates the possibility for new ways of thinking, resolving and interpreting situations, problems and ideas.
Collaboration
Collaboration has been a key part of the iGEM experience for the University of Edinburgh team.
Identity with colour
While some of these conversations seemed arbitrary at the time, we continued to encourage ourselves to question our perceptions of themselves and the people and their environment.
geekiness
flirting with science
Conclusions
These diagrams give an idea of what was talked about during the many conversations we had amongst each other. They achieve a number of things. Firstly, they help those of us focusing on human practices to get to know the team we're in, as well as allowing everyone to get to know each other. This has been a surprisingly open and honest group of people. Everyone gets a say and, while there are some stronger personalities, there has been no need for a clear-cut leader. Secondly, the team gets to assess how they see themselves from individual and disciplinary points of view. By bringing these things into the open people are more likely to ponder on them later which reinforces the awareness of what's needed for a multidisciplinary and multicultural team to work well together. This should put them in good stead in later endeavours.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
