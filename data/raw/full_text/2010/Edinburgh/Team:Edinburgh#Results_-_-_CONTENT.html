 </LI></UL><P>Although we were unable to <B>accomplish</B> absolutely everything that we aimed for, we made great <B>progress</B> in gaining preliminary results and in establishing the foundation of extremely <B>useful</B> (and <B>promotable!</B>) technologies. This page details what we have achieved so far; individual pages for each section summarise our <B>progress</B> on what we'd like to do next as well as any issues that remain, including listing possible reasons for the problems we currently face and the experiments that we are currently <B>undertaking</B> to overcome these.</P><P>Of course, we are  still continuing experiments and hope to have more <B>data</B> to present at the Jamboree... the results <B>presented</B> here are nought but a <B>snapshot</B> in time!</P><H2>Results: Genomic BRIDGEs</H2><H3>Characterisation of <I>cat</I>:</H3><P>We <B>demonstrated</B> that cell lines containing <I>cat</I> in pSB1A2 grew on both ampicillin (100mg/ml) chloramphenicol (40mg/ml) whereas cell lines containing a pSB1A2 control (Edinbrick) only grew on ampicillin (100mg/ml) (see the characterisation <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Project/Protocol#Characterisation">here</A>). This proves that cells <B>successfully</B> transformed with <I>cat</I> during the BRIDGE process should be able to grow in cml40.</P><H3>Characterisation of <I>sacB</I>:</H3><P>We <B>demonstrated</B> that cell lines containing <I>sacB</I> are unable to grow in sucrose at a concentration of 10% compared to control cells which grew normally (see the characterisation <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Project/Protocol#Characterisation">here</A>). This confirms its <B>usefulness</B> as a negative selection marker in the BRIDGE protocol and provided us with conditions for selection at the end of the second step of the protocol.</P><H3>The BRIDGE protocol:</H3><P>The majority of <B>ground gained</B> in our time working on the actual <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Project/Protocol">protocol for BRIDGE</A> was in the <B>adjustment</B> of experimental procedure and the <B>design</B> of control experiments.</P><P>We managed to <B>fine-tune</B> the protocol to our <B>resources</B> and particular strains without causing damage to the cells. For example, we confirmed that ddH20 is not necessary for the washing step. Despite having access to ddH20 we used cold sterile water, which is just as effective at removing LB and antibiotic from cell cultures. These tweaks make the procedure slightly more <B>cost and time effective</B>, especially for labs with limited resources.</P><P>We narrowed down the source of entry of a contaminant that was repeatedly infecting our selection plates by sampling the cells at every stage after exposure to unsterile air, a solution, or an instrument. Through use of negative controls and stringent aseptic technique we managed to <B>eliminate</B> contamination entirely. For example, we sampled the sterile water we had been using and moved our washing step the clean hood, away from unsterile air. These controls enabled us to edit the protocol to <B>advise</B> others on how to avoid contamination and how to find the source of a contaminant should it occur.</P><P>We <B>developed</B> a simple titre of antibiotic resistance by growing our transformants in increasing concentrations of chloramphenicol along with negative controls. This can be used to determine a) the level of <B>success</B> of the procedure and b) the level of resistance of an antibiotic resistance gene (making good <B>characterisation data</B> for the Registry).</P><P>Unfortunately we never <B>achieved</B> our goal of replacing <I>tnaA</I> with the <I>cat/sacB</I> construct via recombineering, but our lab will <B>continue</B> to work with this protocol, possibly replacing the <I>cat</I> gene with a kanamycin resistance gene.</P><P>For anyone wishing to use the BRIDGE protocol we recommend <B>focusing</B> on the recombinase induction step, as this seems to be the problem area which results in the lack of recombinants.</P></DIV><DIV id="body" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 1356px"><H2>Results: Bacterial BRIDGEs</H2><H3>Characterisation of the red light producer:</H3><P>The <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Red_light_producer">mutated firefly luciferases S284T</A> were characterised using a spectrophotometric laser microscope, and shown to have been successfully differentiated from the wild-type, as seen in the emission spectrum . We also considered the effect of temperature and pH on the protein, for example finding 30C incubations to produce a much brighter output than 37C incubations.</P><H3>Characterisation of the red light sensor:</H3><P>We successfully transformed cells with the BioBricks for the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Red_light_sensor">Cph8 sensor system</A> and attempted to characterise them using both <I>lacZ</I> and the YFP reporter systems we introduced to the construct. This produced preliminary data which we will continue to work on, enhancing the sensitivity of our characterisation assays and the test systems for the sensor, in an attempt to further characterise the system.</P><H3>Characterisation of the blue light producer:</H3><P>Currently we have not successfully characterised the emission spectra of the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Blue_light_producer">blue light production</A> system; however, we have successful fusions of the <I>luxAB / lumP</I> construct which show visible differences in their emissions, and are continuing to characterise their spectra.</P><H3>Characterisation of the blue light sensor:</H3><P>Preliminary characterisation data on the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Blue_light_sensor">blue light sensor</A> was achieved, and our overall light sensor characterisation protocol was originally designed and tested on the LovTAP construct. The data has allowed us to refine our protocol for the other sensor systems as well as consider alternative ways of improving the protocol for LovTAP in order to continue further characterisation.</P><H3>Characterisation of the green light producer:</H3><P>Characterisation of the emission spectra of our <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Green_light_producer">wild-type firefly luciferase</A> showed results that were unexpected, as shown in <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/9/9b/Ed10-WTLucSpecChar.jpg">Figure 2</A> on the relevant page. However to the eye it appears visibly yellow, despite the characterisation peak that implies it should be red. We believe this is due to the acidity of the citrate buffer used, as the pH causes the protein to denature and emit red light, however a mix of red and green light is believed to be the cause of the visible yellow.</P><H3>Characterisation of the green light sensor:</H3><P>We have designed and built the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Green_light_sensor">CcaS-PhoR</A> green light sensor system, but have yet to begin characterisation. We intend to conduct preliminary characterisation of the sensor in the near future, hopefully in time for the Jamboree.</P><H3>The FORTH framework:</H3><P>As can be seen, many of the requisite parts of the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial">FORTH light communication framework</A> have been successfully synthesised, tested, and are in the process of being characterised. We wish to eventually integrate them together and test them as part of a single overall system, and look forward to further work that will allow us to do so in the near future.</P><H2>Results: Modelling BRIDGEs</H2><H3>The completed models:</H3><P>The main <B>result</B> achieved by the modelling component of our project was the theoretical <B>conclusion</B> that, given the <B>information</B> available and the <B>assumptions</B> made, the biological systems <B>proposed</B> throughout our project should work. The <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Genomic">genomic BRIDGEs model</A> provided <B>verification</B> of the time course of the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Project/Protocol">BRIDGE protocol</A>. The <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Bacterial">intracellular bacterial BRIDGEs model</A> acted to verify the idea of a <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Core_repressilator">light-based repressilating system</A>, and to confirm that the responses of the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Bacterial">various light pathways</A> were as expected. Finally, the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Signalling">intercellular bacterial BRIDGEs model</A> established the concept of light-based communication within colonies of cells, in all its <B>complexity</B>.</P><P>Each of the above models was extensively <B>analysed</B> via a variety of <B>methods</B> available, in an attempt to <B>push the boundaries</B> of <B>understanding</B> regarding the biological processes <B>embodied</B> within. Some interesting <B>results</B> were revealed, but overall this extensive analysis did much to <B>reinforce</B> the conclusion made above - that theoretically, our proposed light communication systems should work!</P></DIV><DIV id="body" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 1356px"><H3>The Kappa BioBrick framework:</H3><P>Throughout the process, Ty Thomson's <B>framework</B> for modelling BioBricks in Kappa was found to be an <B>invaluable</B> aid in <B>organising</B> and <B>thoroughly describing</B> the biological parts involved. Whether in simply <B>ensuring</B> that the entirety of the BioBrick's actions were <B>described</B>, or in making <B>explicit</B> the <B>correlation</B> between various rate parameters and their <B>effects</B> upon the model, the usefulness of such a <B>structured</B> and <B>standardised</B> framework in developing biological models cannot be <B>understated</B>. We hope in the near future to be able to <B>extend</B> this into the basis of a 'Virtual Registry' of modelled and characterised BioBrick parts and devices, with corresponding <B>tools</B> to aid design and simulation..</P><P>One final result that hopefully was achieved by our modelling is the <B>establishment</B> and <B>promotion</B> of <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Kappa">the Kappa stochastic rule-based modelling language</A> as a <B>BioBrick-friendly alternative</B> to traditional methods of modelling such as differential equations. From its <B>introduction</B> to iGEM by last year's Edinburgh team, this year its use has <B>spread</B> to a handful of other teams as well... we are hopeful that this <B>trend</B> will continue in the near future, due to the numerous <B>advantages</B> that are inherent in the approach.</P><H2>Results: Human BRIDGEs</H2><H3>Communication of science:</H3><P>One has to be <B>careful</B> how science is explained to other scientists as well as to non-scientists. <B>Metaphor</B> can be useful but also <B>problematic</B>. Use wisely. Awareness and general communication about these issues is key.</P><H3>iGEM survey:</H3><P>This makes it clearer what is seen as the <B>important</B> aspects regarding iGEM. As with many things about synthetic biology, <B>discussions</B> have to be had, but there are always multiple <B>voices</B> clamouring to be heard.</P><H3>Conversations:</H3><P>A <B>personal</B> and <B>interdisciplinary</B> venture in how we identify ourselves as individuals, as part of a team, and as part of a discipline.</P><H3>The Epic:</H3><P>An <B>outlet</B> and a much needed distraction for several of our team as well as a great exercise in the <B>communication</B> of synthetic biology to a broader <B>audience</B>.</P><H3>Future applications:</H3><P>An exploration of future <B>scenarios</B> and their <B>implications</B>. We all have contemplated the effects of science in this <B>workshop</B>.</P><H3>The report:</H3><P>And finally, a designer's <B>view</B> of human practices within iGEM, <B>personal</B> and <B>objective</B>... a <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/igem.org/2/2a/Ed10-Report.pdf">report</A><B>expanding</B> on what we have undertaken regarding <B>human practices</B> during the summer of iGEM 2010.</P></DIV><DIV id="body2" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 998px"><H2>Results: In conclusion</H2><P>When we sat down to draft this <B>conclusion</B>, our immediate <B>reaction</B> was... where to <B>begin</B>? As stated above, the <B>information</B> contained on this wiki is merely a <B>snapshot</B> in time. It is nowhere near the end for the techniques and technologies we have sought to <B>develop</B>.</P><P>It's perhaps true that our <B>project</B> isn't quite as flashy as some others, or that it hasn't developed anything quite so <B>immediately</B> useful. But, as befitting of an iGEM project in the Foundational Advances track, we believe that we have made great strides towards the <B>future</B> of synthetic biology. Without reiterating what has already been said above, <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Project">BRIDGE</A>, <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial">FORTH</A>, and <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling">the Kappa BioBrick modelling framework</A> are all important <B>fundamental developments</B> in the field that we hope will <B>inspire</B> and <B>aid</B> many researchers to come.</P><P>Synthetic biology is an ever-evolving field, <B>aspiring</B> to greatness both now and in the future. How <B>advantageous</B> would it be to be able to perform efficient markerless insertion across the whole genome? How <B>cool</B> would it be to replace all street lighting with bioluminescent trees? How <B>useful</B> would it be to have biosensors that communicate with one another or with a computer via light production and sensing? How <B>efficient</B> would it be to be able to accurately design and understand whole systems via a standardised modelling framework? These are but a few of the <B>possibilities</B> we see stemming from our work over the summer.</P><P>We have <B>achieved</B> much. We have <B>learnt</B> more. And we have had a whole load of <B>fun</B>.</P><P>And we think about <B>synthetic biology</B> differently now.</P><P>The question is... how do <B>you</B> think?</P></DIV><DIV id="windowbox" style="border: .2em solid #660000; padding: 5px; position:fixed; top:50%; right:30px; width:8%;"><SPAN style="color:ivory;">Throughout this wiki there are words in <B>bold</B> that indicate a relevance to <B>human aspects</B>.
