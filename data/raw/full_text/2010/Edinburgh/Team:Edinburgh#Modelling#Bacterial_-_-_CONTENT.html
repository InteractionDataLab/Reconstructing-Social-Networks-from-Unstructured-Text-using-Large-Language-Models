All of the main pathways are shown, including light production and light sensing for each of the three wavelengths (red, blue, and green). The dotted interactions in the red light sensing pathway are relevant in analysis of the model, detailed later.</P></CENTER><P>The second <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Kappa">Kappa</A> model created for the project (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/thumb/f/f0/Ed10-OverallPathway.png">Figure 1</A>) attempted to <B>realise</B> the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial">original vision</A> we held for the system: a composite device based on the tried and tested <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Core_repressilator">Elowitz repressilator</A>, combined with light-producing and light-sensing pathways for three different wavelengths. The primary <B>objective</B> of the modelling would then be to <B>confirm</B> that the three pathways <B>interacted</B> with one another in roughly the manner expected, without undue <B>interference</B> or <B>trouble</B>, for example by testing the response of the individual pathways. A secondary objective would involve use of the model in <B>understanding</B> the structure of the system and <B>answering</B> relevant biological questions, for example by <B>comparing</B> different proposed subsystems against one another to <B>analyse</B> which one would work better.</P><P>The following sections <B>describe</B>, in turn: the <A href="#Repressilator">repressilator</A> model that forms the core of the system, the <A href="#RedLight">red light</A> production and signal transduction pathways, the <A href="#BlueLight">blue light</A> production and signal transduction pathways, the <A href="#GreenLight">green light</A> production and signal transduction pathways, a summary of the <A href="#Problems">problems</A> encountered and overcome, the <A href="#Results">results</A> obtained by running the simulation, and finally the <A href="#Analysis">analysis</A> of the results obtained.</P><H2>The Repressilator</H2><P>The <B>core</B> of the intracellular model is formed by the Kappa model of the Elowitz repressilator designed by Ty Thomson in 2009 (available to view <A href="http://www.cellucidate.com/showcase_books/182350-Rule-Based-Modeling-of-BioBrick-Parts">here</A>). This was one of the first models to <B>incorporate</B> the concept of standardised biological parts (i.e. BioBricks) into a modelling context, attempting to &quot;introduce a modular framework for modelling BioBrick parts and systems using rule-based modelling&quot;. The <B>idea</B> was to model at the level of individual parts, such that systems could be <B>constructed</B> using different components by paying a <B>cost</B> upfront with the construction of models of the parts, and thus making modular construction of specific models practically <B>effort-free</B> - similar to the idea of characterised and composable BioBricks used in the <B>design</B> and <B>construction</B> of synthetic biological circuits.</P><P>The <B>framework</B> as described by Ty Thomson <B>establishes</B> a <B>concise</B> set of Kappa rules necessary to <B>incorporate</B> BioBricks into a Kappa model, by dividing them into four broad <B>categories</B> according to function - promoter sequences, coding sequences, ribosome binding sites, and terminators. For example, a promoter sequence must <B>define</B> how repressor proteins and RNA polymerases bind with it, how transcription is initiated, and what happens when readthrough occurs and the promoter sequence is transcribed. A coding sequence must <B>define</B> its transcription, translation initiation and actual translation, and degradation of the translated protein (description of the action of the protein itself is not necessary, with the exception of its repressor activity which would be described in the corresponding promoter sequence). Finally, a ribosome binding site must define how a ribosome may bind with the site and how the RBS is transcribed, and a terminator must define how termination occurs and what happens if said termination fails.</P><P>The framework also <B>describes</B> what rates are necessary for the complete <B>characterisation</B> of the model. These correspond to the rules given above, and include: promoter binding affinities and rate of RNAP recruitment; rate of transcription and rate of recruitment for ribosome binding sites; rates of transcription, translation, and degradation for protein coding sequences; and terminator percentage of successful termination. Although very few, if any, of the BioBricks in the Registry are characterised to this extent of modelling <B>utility</B>, such a framework at least provides a goal to which modellers can <B>aspire</B> to.</P></DIV><DIV id="body" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 1356px"><P>Thomson's model of the Elowitz repressilator was created as a <B>working example</B> of this framework, and is <B>capable</B> of fully simulating the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Bacterial/Core_repressilator">interactions</A> that occur within the system (see <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/6/6e/Ed10-RepressilatorResults.png">Figure 2</A>).

The <B>assumption</B> is made that there is a relatively static amount of Cph8 and OmpR within the system, and that there is no need to model their creation via transcription and translation or their degradation. <B>Assumptions</B> are also made regarding the balance between the concentration of on / off Cph8 and phosphorylated / unphosphorylated OmpR when the system is stable, as well as the fact that OmpR can only change phosphorylation state when not bound to any of Cph8, <I>ompC</I>, or <I>ompF</I>.</P><P>When red light is not present in the system, an equilibrium exists between 'on' and 'off' Cph8 (heavily biased towards the 'on' state) and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated OmpR (heavily biased towards the phosphorylated state). When the red light sensing pathway is activated by bursts of photons at the correct wavelength, the Cph8 sensor is almost all turned 'off', which leads to OmpR almost fully unphosphorylated. The <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0082"><I>ompC</I></A> promoter is activated by phosphorylated OmpR in sufficient quantity, and is coupled to the BioBricked protein coding sequence <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_C0040">BBa_C0040</A> that produces TetR. Minor <B>assumptions</B> are made regarding the kinetic rates related to the <I>ompF</I> and <I>ompC</I> promoters within the model.</P><P>Thus, in standard conditions involving the isolated pathway, large amounts of TetR are produced due to the action of the phosphorylated OmpR protein.

The fusion protein can be either 'on' or 'off' depending on whether or not it senses light of the appropriate wavelength; when 'on', it acts to phosphorylate the response protein PhoB. The phosphorylated PhoB can then act as an inhibitory transcription factor on a hypothetical promoter possibly based on one of the <I>phoA</I>, <I>phoS</I>, or <I>ugpB</I> genes. This pathway as a whole is depicted in <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/9/99/Ed10-GreenLightSensorPathway.png">Figure 9</A>.</P><CENTER><P><B>Figure 9:</B> A simplified diagram of the hypothetical green light sensor, showing the mechanism of action of green light on the CcaS-PhoR-PhoB pathway.</P></CENTER></DIV><DIV id="body" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 1356px"><P>Many <B>assumptions</B> are made in the modelling of this pathway - for example, PhoB is generally characterised as an activator rather than a repressor, and thus some form of negation (i.e. a 'NOT' gate similar to the inverter built into the red light transduction pathway) will have to be built into the system, either as part of the pathway itself or by creating a <B>hypothetical</B> repressive promoter. The second <B>approach</B> was chosen when modelling the pathway, for the simplicity it offers.</P><P>When green light is not present in the system, the CcaS-PhoR fusion remains in the 'off' state. When green light is present, however, the fusion changes configuration to the 'on' state, which then proceeds to cascade a signal down the transduction pathway by phosphorylating PhoB, which then acts as a transcription factor.</P><P>Thus, in standard conditions for the isolated pathway, large amounts of LacI are produced by the uninhibited promoter. On the other hand, when blue light activates the signal transduction pathway, CcaS-PhoR activation is followed by an increase in the concentration of phosphorylated PhoB, which represses the production of LacI in the system until the effect wears off.</P><CENTER><P><B>Figure 10:</B> Results of simulating the green light sensing pathway as described above.

More <B>traditional</B> methods of biological modelling, such as systems of ordinary differential equations, quickly grow beyond the realm of computational feasibility when confronted with <B>complex</B> pathways and multiple layers of <B>interaction</B>; Kappa is able to handle these <B>intricacies</B> with relative ease. On the other hand, there remain many other <B>problems</B> involved in modelling biological systems that cannot be solved simply by choice of modelling language, for example, the <B>assumptions</B> and <B>abstractions</B> necessary to condense the entirety of the reaction classes involved into an easily <B>understandable</B> mathematical and computational model. Biological interactions are unlike interactions in electronic circuits or networks: not enough is fully <B>understood</B> and clearly <B>documented</B> to be able to accurately and precisely <B>describe</B> the intricacies involved, and individual <B>interpretations</B> made by the modeller cloud the issue even further. Even if they were understood and documented, it is not <B>clear</B> that current modelling techniques and hardware limitations would allow for such simulation in a <B>meaningful</B> manner.</P><P>Another <B>drawback</B> of mathematical models lies in their use of arbitrary kinetic rates to determine the <B>behaviour</B> of the model, and the necessity of <B>balancing</B> them off against one another such that the desired <B>interactions</B> occur at the desired frequency, with only a vague <B>recognition</B> of what the value of each parameter might actually <B>represent</B><I>in vivo</I>. In the absence of experimental methods to accurately <B>extract</B> kinetic rates in the face of overwhelming biological noise, it is <B>difficult</B> to see any way around the use of mathematical <B>methods</B> such as coordinate optimisation and sensitivity analysis to <B>determine</B> an appropriate set of parameters. One oft-encountered result of this lack of accurate parameters that has been previously touched upon is the presence of non-meaningful (arbitrary) units of time within the simulation.</P><P>In relation to the above, the <B>fine-tuning</B> of the response for each of the sensor pathways was an <B>important</B> part of the model-building process. This was a <B>non-trivial task</B>, specially since both red and green sensor pathways were modelled as two-stage responses, and hence the reaction to the stimulus was more complex and took place over a longer period of time. Furthermore, the <B>proposed</B> sensor pathways involved a number of complex interactions that were not necessarily <B>obvious</B> on paper, due to potentially involving separate genetic interactions which would hopefully <B>complement</B> one another with the same effect (as shown by the dotted lines in <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/thumb/f/f0/Ed10-OverallPathway.png">Figure 1</A>). <B>Investigation</B> of which one of the interactions would be more powerful, and whether or not both of them would be required, would form a major part of the perturbation <B>analysis</B> conducted upon the model.</P><P>Finally, the model-building progress involved a large amount of <B>debugging</B> - the number of different proteins and genes involved made it <B>difficult</B> to predict what <B>effect</B> one stray bug might have on system as a whole. For example, an <B>issue</B> was identified early on in which transcription factors deactivated whilst bound to genes and could not be unbound, thus permanently preventing the gene from transcribing. This <B>highlights</B> the need to be careful when specifying rules, but it also must be noted that the <B>organisation</B> of individual reactions into reaction classes (rules) also makes it <B>easier</B> to <B>identify</B> such bugs and to deal with them, thus supporting the notion of agent- and rule-based modelling as a way of <B>thinking</B> as well as a way of <B>modelling</B>.</P><P>The original <B>brief</B> for the modelling component envisioned an <B>iterative</B> process in which the model would be <B>revisited</B> and <B>refined</B> throughout the project timeline using wet-lab characterisation <B>results</B>, in line with the synthetic biology ideal of attempting to bring engineering principles into biological systems. This would involve not only the use of the model as a simple <B>design</B> and <B>prototype</B> tool, but also as an important <B>artefact</B> of the team's <B>understanding</B> and <B>knowledge</B> of the system, for example by <B>incorporating</B> data regarding pathway response times, interactions between light-producing and light-sensing parts of similar wavelengths, and the effects of combining the light components with the core repressilator. Unfortunately, the ten weeks dedicated to iGEM is not long enough to allow for the full benefits of such a process to be realised, and given the <B>unpredictable</B> nature of biological <B>procedures</B>, it was very quickly obvious that the original brief would have to be abandoned in favour of a more agile <B>approach</B>, in which models would be created for a specific purpose or to answer an important question.</P><P>Both <B>methodologies</B> have their distinct <B>advantages</B> and <B>disadvantages</B>, an <B>iterative</B> process lending itself more to a comprehensive and structured project, whilst an <B>agile</B> process is more useful in a short-term results-oriented project such as iGEM. Although it may have been slightly <B>ambitious</B> to attempt the former in the short time-span given, it remains obvious that models can <B>inspire</B> and in turn be <B>inspired</B> by the wealth of information accumulated by experiements both biological and computational in nature. For example, models may require more accurate biological <B>information</B> to be able to precisely <B>mimic</B> and <B>predict</B> the interactions of the entities involved, but experimental biologists may in turn <B>rely</B> upon the use of models to <B>interpret</B> and <B>collate</B> the vast amounts of <B>data</B> that can be accumulated from modern experiments, using this to determine the <B>focus</B> of future studies. The ability for the two components to <B>complement</B> and provide constructive <B>feedback</B> to one another is <B>invaluable</B> in a project of this nature.</P><H2>Results</H2><CENTER><P><B>Figure 12:</B> Modelled emission results for the light production pathways coupled to the repressilator.

The many <B>assumptions</B> made during the modelling process mean that it is unlikely that the system as is can produce as clean oscillations <I>in vivo</I>, especially given the ubiquitous <B>difficulties</B> in translating an <I>in silico</I> model to an <I>E. coli</I> host. For example, <B>ensuring</B> that all substrates required for the production of light (i.e. LuxCDE, LumP, etc.) are constitutively available at all times may prove to be <B>difficult</B> in a cellular environment without disrupting the natural processes. On the other hand, it is useful <B>verification</B> of the hope that the core system will perform correctly, and that the proposed <B>design</B> will be able to produce a visible and easily discernible output.</P><P>The <B>complexity</B> of the model becomes more apparent when applying perturbation analysis to determine the response to light sensed from another organism, i.e. activation of the light sensing pathways by applying short bursts of external light (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/f/ff/Ed10-RepressilatingLightsPerturbResults.png">Figure 13</A>).</P><CENTER><P><B>Figure 13:</B> Modelled emission results for the light production and light sensing pathways coupled to the repressilator, perturbed firstly by the introduction of a large amount of external blue light at t=10000, and secondly by the introduction of a large amount of external red light at t=15000. The perturbations have the effect of inhibiting the effect of blue and red light produced respectively, thus ushering the cell into the next stage of the repressilating cycle. Units (time and concentration) are arbitrary.</P></CENTER><P>The <B>non-trivial interactions</B> between the light sensing pathways and the core repressilator make it difficult to accurately predict the precise response of the system to <B>perturbation</B>. Despite this, however, the above graph shows an example of the system reacting as it should. The presence of external blue light at t=10000 acts to repress the blue light production pathways within the system (especially noticeable since the peak of the light output is lower than the previous two peaks), ushering it into the red light production phase; similarly, the presence of external red light at t=15000 results in repression of the red light production pathways. An example of an <B>interesting</B> result of the analysis of these <B>interactions</B> is confirmation of the fact that low amounts of light are not sufficient to enact a <B>change</B> in the overall model - relatively intense bursts are necessary to realise an effect.</P><P>The finalised model can be found <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/f/ff/Ed10-RepressilatingLights.txt">here</A>.</P><H2>Analysis</H2><P>At this stage of the modelling process, we were confident that we had <B>achieved</B> a working prototype design of the biological system that we wished to <B>aim</B> for. We could now begin to <B>ask</B> various questions of the model, for example:</P><UL><LI>Are the responses triggered by the light sensor pathways strong enough to affect the core repressilator (pathway analysis)?</LI><LI>How does the model react to different combinations of outside light (perturbation analysis)?</LI><LI>How much does the choice of rate parameters affect the behaviour of the model (parameter sensitivity analysis)?</LI><LI>Would increasing the copy numbers of DNA in the model have an effect on its behaviour (initial condition analysis)?</LI></UL><P>When considering pathway analysis, we asked whether we would be able to <B>reinforce</B> the base sensor pathways with complementary pathways that would help to achieve a stronger effect. For example, <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/thumb/f/f0/Ed10-OverallPathway.png">Figure 1</A> at the top of the page depicts (in dotted lines) a 'helper' pathway to the red light sensor that would <B>theoretically</B> reinforce the action via the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0082"><I>ompC</I></A> promoter. The <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0084"><I>ompF</I></A> promoter is activated by minimal amounts of phosphorylated OmpR (and is inhibited by its presence in large quantities); when active in our system, it stimulates production of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_C0012">LacI</A>. The presence of increased amounts of LacI in the system will act to inhibit the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0010"><I>lacI</I></A> promoter, which then controls expression of TetR as per the standard repressilator.</P><P>Unfortunately, repeated simulation showed that <B>arbitrarily</B> increasing the amount of LacI in the system only served to throw off the core repressilator, often sending it out of <B>synchronosity</B> by allowing one of the three core proteins (usually LacI) to continuously dominate. This did not happen on each and every run, but was frequent enough to render the entire system extremely <B>unstable</B> and <B>unpredictable</B>. The results served to <B>illustrate</B> the difficulty of working with biological systems of this complexity, in which a single modification can have any number of unforeseen and unintended <B>repercussions</B>.</P><P>The Kappa <B>environment</B> is ideal for conducting perturbation analysis, as evidenced by the numerous examples of such <B>analysis</B> conducted above (i.e. stimulation of the individual light sensor pathways, timed perturbation of the system as a whole). However, in order to fully <B>answer</B> the question of how the system reacts to different combinations of light from outside stimuli, it quickly became apparent that the intracellular model alone would not be sufficient; we would need to consider the intercellular <B>aspects</B> of the system as well (i.e. the communication of light between bacteria and their responses to stimuli). The complexity of this <B>endeavour</B> meant that it <B>evolved</B> into a separate aspect of the modelling component of our project, found <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Signalling">here</A>.</P><P>Sensitivity analysis (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/d/d4/Ed10-BlueLightSPResults.png">Figure 14</A>) and initial condition analysis (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/2/2b/Ed10-RepressilatingLightsIPResults2.png">Figure 15</A>) were both similar in that they involved <B>altering</B> the mathematical parameters used within the model and then <B>observing</B> the effects of the alterations. The former can be used to <B>formalise</B> the delicate balance in rate parameters already described above, for example in the concentration of on / off Cph8 in the red light sensor or the speed of the pathway response in the LovTAP hybrid protein. The latter allows us to <B>explore</B> the effect, for example, of increasing the copy number of plasmids bearing the system within the modelled cell. Sample results from the two different types of analysis are shown in the series of graphs below; this is by no means the extent of what can be <B>accomplished</B> via this type of quantitative analysis, but help to answer a few key questions regarding the model.</P></DIV><DIV id="body" style="padding: 0px 60px 10px 60px; height: 1356px"><CENTER><P><B>Figure 14:</B> Modelled emission results for the light production and light sensing pathways coupled to the repressilator, increasing the sensitivity of the LovTAP protein to light.
