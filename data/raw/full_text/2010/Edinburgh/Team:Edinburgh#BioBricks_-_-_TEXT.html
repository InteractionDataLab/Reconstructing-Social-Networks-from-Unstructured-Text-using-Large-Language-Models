BioBricks: Genomic BRIDGEs
For the BRIDGE protocol we have one main BioBrick , which is the construct required for the two-step markerless insertion, a composite construct of cat ( chloramphenicol resistance ) and sacB ( prevention of growth on sucrose ).
In addition, we submitted the up- and downstream sequences of an example of a useful gene to be removed from the E. coli genome using the BRIDGE protocol: tnaA, which produces indole, such that when it is removed E. coli no longer smells!

BioBricks: Bacterial BRIDGEs
The light-sensing and light-production BioBricks of various emission / absorbance wavelengths developed in the FORTH light communication framework are listed below. A few are resubmissions of existing parts (noted as such in their descriptions), whilst others are composite devices with promoters and reporter systems.
The BioBricks for red light production are two variants of mutated firefly luciferase ( S284T and 356K ) and their composite reporter systems.

Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
