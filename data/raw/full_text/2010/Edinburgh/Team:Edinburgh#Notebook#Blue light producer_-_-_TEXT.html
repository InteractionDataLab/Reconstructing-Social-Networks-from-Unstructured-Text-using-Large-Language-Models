LuxAB & LuxCDE operon agarose gel
Lane1: About2.1.kbp
Lane 2: The highest band- very faint- about 3.5kbp
13/7/2010
Empty edinbrick vector for control.
LuxAB + edinbrick ligation.
28/7/2010
an update on LuxAB:
The transformations of Edinbrick are fine but all the luxABs failed (grew blue, not white on Xgal and did not glow, as of 27/7)/
Still have some digested LuxAB-ediI so re-did ligation and transformation.

The ligation had the same gel characteristics as previous luxAb-ediI ligations, e.x. it isn't visivle- not hopeful of this transformation working
4/8/2010
made minipreps of blue (negative colonies)- double digest and ran in comparison with pure edinbrickI
LacZ band dissapears but colonies still grow blue (WTF)
Has bands equaling to luxAB and EdiI but there was no glowing
12/8/2010 update on LumP:
still getting pink/red colonies from transformants
single digests give a band of about 3kb
double digests give a band of about 2.5 kb -highly confusing
and also, no sign on RFP despite red/pink growth.
Vector wa ssequenced and LumP is definately there.
Lanes 2-5: single digests of lumP Lane 6: double digest of lumP
26/8/2010
Marker (Lane 1), minipreps 6-10 luxABlumP (lanes 2-6)
