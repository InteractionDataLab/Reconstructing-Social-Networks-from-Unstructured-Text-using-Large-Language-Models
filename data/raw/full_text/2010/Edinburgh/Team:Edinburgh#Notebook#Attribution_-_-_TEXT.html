Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
Attributions and Contributions
For iGEM 2010, the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors. And thus, with no further ado...
The BioBrick constructs for the BRIDGE protocol were mostly made by Maria, except for the cat gene made by Geraldine Avila.
sacB was characterised by Lu and Hannah, cat by Maria.
The BRIDGE protocol was adapted from the Gene Bridges Red/ET protocol by Maria. All control experiments were designed and carried out by Maria.
The bacterial BRIDGEs (FORTH) project was divided into 6 parts:
- The wild type luciferase was characterised and submitted by Will and Lu.
- The red luciferase was mutated, characterised and submitted by Will.
- The LuxAB-LumP fusion was successfully completed and submitted by Richard.
- The green light sensor was designed and made by Will and Lu.
- The red light sensor was reconstructed and characterised by Richard.
- The LovTAP characterisation experiment was designed and carried out by Marta.
The modelling components of the project were undertaken by John and Donal, building on previous unrelated work by Ty Thomson (the BioBrick framework and the core repressilator). John created the genomic and bacterial models, while Donal worked on the tools and the signalling model.
The human practices component of the project was the responsibility of Matt, with guidance from Emma Frow and Jane Calvert. The entire team (and others as appropriate) pitched in whenever possible, for example in helping to define terms and write self-reflective essays. Robbie Henderson helped out greatly with the future applications component.
The Epic was the brainchild of Maria and Hannah, who were supported in writing it by John and Richard.
Poster, presentation, and wiki design was done by Matt.
The whole team were responsible for the content of the above, but particular kudos go to Maria, Matt, and John (the presentation team!).
Credit (and discredit) for wiki implementation goes to John.
Gilbert was thrown about. Kenny cheered us on. Fun was had by all.
