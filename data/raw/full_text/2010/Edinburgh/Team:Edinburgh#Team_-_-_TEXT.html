Team - Illuminati
We are the Illuminati - a multidisciplinary team based at the University of Edinburgh , consisting of ten students, two advisors, and two supervisors from various different backgrounds including biology, engineering, informatics, and design. Assembled during the summer of 2010 to take part in the worldwide synthetic biology competition known as iGEM , we consider ourselves to be a fun and eclectic bunch, if perhaps somewhat eccentric as well.
Supervisors

Our introductory pages also contain more information on the University of Edinburgh, as well as a gallery of some of the more amusing photographs and videos taken of us during the iGEM summer.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
