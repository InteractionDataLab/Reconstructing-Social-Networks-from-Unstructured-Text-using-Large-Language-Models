The Darwin Building in the King's Buildings campus is part of the Darwin-Rutherford-Swann (DRS) complex, which is in turn home to the School of Biological Sciences of the University of Edinburgh . The 2010 iGEM team has taken over the Honours Room on the top floor of the building, where a bank of twelve computers and a small kitchen provide a base of operations, and conduct wet lab activities in the French Laboratory on the floor below. Despite the high levels of asbestos within the architecture and its generally ugly 1930s decor, it is now our home away from home.
The University of Edinburgh was founded in 1582 as the fourth university in Scotland and the sixth in the United Kingdom. It has long enjoyed a reputation for academic excellence, having been at the forefront of the 18th century Age of Enlightenment and now a member of leading international research associations including the Coimbra Group , the LERU , and Universitas 21 . Over the years, such famous alumni as Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Alexander Graham Bell, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir Walter Scott have emerged from its halls.
The modern University of Edinburgh has three main faculties, amongst them the College of Science and Engineering , which are in turn split up into twenty-one schools including the School of Biological Sciences , the School of Engineering , and the School of Informatics . With the expansion in topics of study over its long history, the university is now split over seven campuses throughout the city, including the King's Buildings campus that houses a world-leading Biology department.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
