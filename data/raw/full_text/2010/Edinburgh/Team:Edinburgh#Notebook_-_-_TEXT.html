Lab Books
The following section contains the assorted lab books associated with the different strands of BRIDGEing considered during the course of our projects. We hope that they may be of some use to future teams in divining what we did and why we did it.
Table of Contents
Detailing the collaborations that occurred between our team and other iGEM teams around the world.
Detailing what work was done by our team, as distinguished from that done by our advisors and supervisors.
Detailing the labwork done on the BRIDGE protocol.
Detailing the labwork done on the red light producer.
Detailing the labwork done on the red light sensor.
Detailing the labwork done on the blue light producer.
Detailing the labwork done on the blue light sensor.
Detailing the labwork done on the green light producer.
Detailing the labwork done on the green light sensor.
Detailing the labwork done on the modelling components.
Detailing how we approached issues of biological safety associated with our projects.
Detailing the protocols used in our projects.
Throughout this wiki there are words in bold that indicate a relevance to human aspects. It will become obvious that human aspects are a part of almost everything in iGEM.
