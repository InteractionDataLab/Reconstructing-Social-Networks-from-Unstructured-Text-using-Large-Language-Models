Ligation of PS and pSB1C3 and pCB1AK3
Date: 8/24 2010
Done By: Maria and Lc
Protocol: LG1.2
Notes:
For each of the ligations three ligation mixtures were prepared. vector concentrations of 10n0g/uL (pSB3C5) and 50ng/uL (pSB3T5) respectively was used for each mixture. Appropiate amount of insert was added to reach vector:insert ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:6 respectively.

Transfomation of ligated plasmid in Top 10 E.coli
Date: 8/25 2010
Done By: Maria and Lc
Protocol: CC1.1 TR1.1
Notes:
The compotent cells and transformation was carried out according to protocol.
Results:
the controle plates were okay, and there were many colonies on plates with cells transformed with either of the ligation mixtures..
Analysis:
The transformation was successfull and colonies was selected and used in coloni PCR.
