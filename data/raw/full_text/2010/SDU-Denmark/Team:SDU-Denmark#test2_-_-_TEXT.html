Team:SDU-Denmark/test2
From 2010.igem.org
iGEM wiki
Ok, I’m going to think about a really witty title for the next entry, but you’ll have to bear with me one more time.  So once again our iGEM team had a little meeting, but this time around it was only the students meeting up. No instructors, just us 14 (Alright, we were actually only 13!).  We decided on a lot of dates for future events, like a laboratory course, brainstorms, when the lab work is going to start in the summer holidays and when we want to have decided on a project. On top of that our BMB students (Louise, Marie, Maria and Pernille) agreed to hold a little lesson about basic cellular biology some time next week, so there won’t be any excuses for not knowing about the mechanisms behind DNA, RNA processing and translation and all the other fun stuff for the rest of the team  !  Arto (our computer science student) is also at some point in the future going to give the team a little lesson about algorithms and how a program makes decisions based on the outcome of these. This will probably be something many of us have never heard about, so it’ll be really interesting.  Besides the more serious stuff, we are also going to have some purely social arrangements, so we can get to know each other a little better. These are most certainly going to feature wine and pizza (or cake!) - it’s probably safe to say that everyone is looking forward to these  ! On the subject of cake, thanks to Arto for the cake today, it was great!  Sorry, but we don’t have any pictures today.  That’s all for today, please continue to visit our blog and follow our soon-to-come adventures in synthetic biology!  Lars Christian
