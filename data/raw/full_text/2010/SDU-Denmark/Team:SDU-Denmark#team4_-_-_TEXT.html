Collaborators
Over the past six months we have collaborated with a lot of people. On this page you will find a list of the people who have helped us and whom we have helped.
The Bielefeldt team - visited us from September 24th to 26th, where we presented our projects to each other. We have sent our ninaB coding sequence (retinal generator) to the Bielefeld team and they have sent us their Lac promoter to be characterized .
The DTU-Denmark team - We visited the DTU team on October 9th where we presented our projects and commented on the power point presentations so that they can be fine-tuned for the jamboree.
The Warsaw team we helped the Warsaw team filling in the inquiry form concerning generale iGEM team questions.
Unisensor A/S - We have been working together with Unisensor A/S for characterizing our photosensor part. At unisensor they are developing a machine that is able to track many microscopic particles in a liquid, which means it is well suited for motility analysis on bacteria. The Thor prototype is able to follow a large amount of microbes at the same time, which makes the results more statistically viable than traditional cell tracking tools. For data analysis we use the unify software, which analyses the videos from the thor prototype and outputs data like: speed, force, path and tumbling frequency of the bacteria. In return we give them feedback in regards to usability and application of their machines and software.
