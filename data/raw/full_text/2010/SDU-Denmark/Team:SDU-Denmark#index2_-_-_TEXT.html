Welcome to the iGEM wiki of the University of Southern Denmark
Here you will find all kinds of information about our project. We want to modify an E.Coli strain so that a colony of it will be able to establish and control a flow in a microtube.
The wiki is still very much a work in progress, but content will be added almost daily over the next few months. So check back often, to follow our progress, since we from now on will be concentrating on the wiki for the more serious information on our project instead of our blog.
