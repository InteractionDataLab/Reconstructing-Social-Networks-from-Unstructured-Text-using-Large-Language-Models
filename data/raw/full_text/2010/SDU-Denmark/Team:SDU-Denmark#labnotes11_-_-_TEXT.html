Photosensor group
Miniprep of PS (composit part) in pSB3T5
Date: 9/22 2010
Done By: Lc and Maria
Protocol: MP1.2
Notes:
col. N and J from the coloni PCR was selected and miniprep'ed according to protocol. Sample 1 of each colni was eluted in 20uL elution buffer, and sample 2 of each coloni was eluted according to protocol.
To ensure thet the plasimids contained the correct insert, the miniprep'ed plasmids were digested with EcoRI and PstI.
Restriction mixture:
12uL H2O
2uL FD green buffer
1uL EcoRI
1uL PstI
5uL Plasmid from either col. N or J
The samples are digested for 10 min. at 37C, and samples are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. Undigested plasmid is used as controle and gene ruler DNA ladder mix is used as marker.
Loading scheme:

Results:
Analysis:
Two bands are observed en the lanes of the digestes samples representing undigested plasmid and insert.
Miniprep samples are sent for sequencing and is stored at -20C.
