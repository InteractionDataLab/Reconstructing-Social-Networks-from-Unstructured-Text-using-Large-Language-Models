Control restriction digest of PS+B0015 in pSB1AK3 sample Q, miniprep
Date: 09/14
Done by: LC
Methods: Restriction digest
Protocols: RD1.1 [1]
Notes:
The afore mentioned miniprep of PS+B0015 in pSB1AK3 (Q) was cut with EcoRI and PstI to check if biobrick pre- and suffix are present and the insert is the right size.
Mix for 1 RD reaction:
12 ul H2O
1 ul PstI
1 ul EcoRI
2 ul Fast digest green buffer
5 ul PCR product
Uncut PCR product was loaded on the gel as a control.
Results: The RD resulted in three bands, uncut plasmid, plasmid and insert. All of those were the expected lengths, so the sample should be OK.

Date: 9/15 2010
Done By: Maria and Lc
Protocol: CP1.3
Notes:
To ensure that the plasminds sent to sequencing contains the correct inserts, af controle PCR of the minipreps using the PS forward and reverse primer is carried out.
