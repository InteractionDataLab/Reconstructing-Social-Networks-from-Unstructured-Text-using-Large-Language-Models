Week 26
Flagella
Studied inhibition and activation of the FlhD/C operon.
We found out that PskA is an important inhibitor, which also is part of ribosome synthesis.
Phototaxis
Ordered proteorhodopsin biobrick I711040
Did research on the light-sensitive proteorhodopsin ionpump.
Week 27
Flagella
Read up on the flagella regulon using the following articles;
[1] Cell Cycle Regulation of Flagellar Genes
Birgit M. Prüß and Philip Matsumura
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612-7344
[2]
The FlhD/FlhC Complex, a Transcriptional Activator of the Escherichia coli Flagellar Class II Operons
Xiaoying Liu and Philip Matsumura
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612-7344
Decided to follow the popular "trial-and-error" method and tested what effects it will have to put the FlhD/C operon after a constitutive active promoter.
Ordered the FlhD/C primers.
Designed the biobrick K343000 – FlhDCmut coding sequence
Phototaxis
Decided to go back to the original idea for controlling phototaxis via a SRII/HtrII/EcTsr fusion-chimeric protein described in the following article;
[3] Photostimulation of a Sensory Rhodopsin II/HtrII/Tsr Fusion Chimera Activates CheA-Autophosphorylation and CheY-Phosphotransfer in Vitro†
Vishwa D. Trivedi and, John L. Spudich
Biochemistry 2003 42 (47), 13887-13892
which is shown to work in K-12 E. coli in this article;
[4] An Archaeal Photosignal-Transducing Module Mediates Phototaxis in Escherichia coli
Jung, Kwang-Hwan, Spudich, Elena N., Trivedi, Vishwa D., Spudich, John L.
J. Bacteriol. 2001 183: 6365-6371
Contacted the original researchers on the mentioned papers for the protein sequences and plasmids
Retinal Production
Decided that we would try to make our bacteria synthesize retinal endogenously.
Designed a new BioBrick around the ninaB gene from D. melanogaster, which has shown to produce a beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase [5] [6] .
Isolated the gene sequence and suggested biobricks for the coding region (K343001)
Proposed three new biobricks
K343001 - Sandboxed coding sequence from ninaB gene.
K343002 - Sandboxed coding sequence from ninaB gene on one of the weaker Anderson promoters, with rbs and dual terminator.
K343003 - Sandboxed coding sequence for the SopII-HtrII-Tsr fusion protein.

Modelling
Read articles about modelling the flagella movement and their influence on the water flow.
Looked at the equations describing the system from the article to get an idea of how the physics is applied. The following articles was used in this progress;
[7] Synchronization in a carpet of hydrodynamically coupled rotors with random intrinsic frequency N. Uchida 1 and R. Golestanian 2,  ELP(Europhysics Letters) volume 89, number 5.
[8] The physics of flagellar motion of E. coli during chemotaxis M. Siva Kumar and P. Philominathan Biophysical Reviews Volume 2, Number 1 / February, 2010.
Met with our advisor Associate professor Julian C. Shillcock, PhD (SDU) who helped us plan a model for the system using the article;
[9] Synchronization in a carpet of hydrodynamically coupled rotors with random intrinsic frequency N. Uchida 1 and R. Golestanian 2, ELP(Europhysics Letters) volume 89, number 5.
Week 28

Transformed pSB1A2-J13002(TetR repressed generator), pSB1A2-K274210 (CrtEBIY under constitutive promoter), pSB1AK3-B0015 into E.coli MG1655
Modelling
Discussed Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations in relation to the system we would like to model.
Tied to identify a differential equation describing the system. The following physics books have been used:
The theory of polymer dynamics, M. DOI, S. F. Edwards, oxford science publications, 4. edition 1992.
Physics of continuous matter, B. Lautrup, IOP publishing, 2005.
Started implementing our model.

The iGEM team had a fun afternoon playing kindergarteners with the Students' Association and Louise made this lovely iGEM DENMARK logo out of plastic pearls. She didn't realize she had written 21010 instead of 2010 until the pearls were melted together though... rookie mistake.
