Colony PCR
CP1.1
How to amplify DNA from bacterial colonies and solutions
Important remarks
All solutions should be kept at ice until run of PCR
Materials
Premix Pfu-PCR
For 1 PCR reaction:
• 5 µL Pfu-buffer + MgSO4
• 1.5 µL 10mM dNTP mix
• 1.5 µL 10pmol/µL forward primer
• 1.5 µL 10pmol/µL reverse primer
• 0.5 µL Pfu polymerase enzyme (add just before PCR run)
• 40 µL H2O
Total vol.: 5O µL
Premix TAQ-PCR (no proofreading):
For 1 PCR reaction
• 2.5 µL 10x TAQ-buffer + MgCl2
• 0.5 µL 10mM dNTP mix
• 1.25 µL 10pmol/µL forward primer
• 1.25 µL 10pmol/µL reverse primer
• 19.25 µL Water
• 0.25 µL TAQ polymerase enzyme (add just before PCR run)
Total vol.: 25 µL
The TAQ polymerase has no proofreading, and should therefore only be used for size determination of DNA fragments. When PCR-product is to be purified and used for further experiments always use Pfu polymerase!!! Make enough premix for your number of colony +1.
Protocol
Colony PCR:
1. Select and transfer a single colony to a PCR tube with a pipette tip (afterwards use the same for plating out on plates)
2. Add all of the H2O used in the premix to the PCR tubes and place them in the microwave at full power for 2 min. with an open lid.
3. Make the premix (without water). Do not add enzyme until just before premix is added to the PCR tubes. Mix the premix by pipetting up and down (do not vortex!)
4. Add premix to each PCR tube.
5. Run PCR
PCR of DNA in solutions:
1. Transfer 1-2 µL of DNA to each PCR tube (to obtain the correct total volume adjust the volume of the H2O)
2. Make the premix(do not add enzyme until just before premix is added to the PCR tubes). Mix the premix by pipetting up and down (do not vortex!)
3. Add premix to each PCR tube.
4. Run PCR.

Extraction af Carotenoids and polyene chromophores
EX1.1
1. Incubate E. Coli in 110 ml LB media with appropriate antibiotics at 37 degrees celcius for 20 hours

3. Resuspend cells in 8 mL acetone and sonicate the sample for 2x 30 sek
4. Centrifuge the samples at 16000g for 2 min and collect 2 mL of the supernatant
5. Measure absorbance using UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 450 nm
EX1.2
1. Incubate E. Coli in 110 ml LB media with appropriate antibiotics at 37 degrees celcius for 20 hours
2. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 4000g for 15 min
3. Re-suspend cells in 8 mL acetone and sonicate the sample for 2x 30 sek
4. Centrifuge the samples at 16000g for 2 min and collect 2 mL of the supernatant
5. Measure absorbance using an HPLC at 450 nm for bata-carotene and 382 nm for retinal analysis, For this particular purpose, we use a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (4,6 x 150 mm 2,7 micron)column, and the eluents used are as follows:
A-buffer: 100% methanol with 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid.
B-buffer: A mixture consisting of 60% methanol and 40% acetone with 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid.
Due to the chemical properties of beta-carotene and retinal, respectively, retinal will come through the column before beta-carotene when a gradient is run from 100% A-buffer to 100% B-buffer.
Afterwards, the solutions of purified retinal or beta-carotene are studied using UV-vis photospectrometry and the values and spectra are compared to those of the same compounds of known concentrations. Again, this gives both qualitative and quantitative indications of whether the compound in question is present and, if it is, in what concentration. Usage of the HPLC and instruction on how to use it was kindly provided by FLINT
