Primers
On this page we list all the primers we designed and used during the summer. All primers were kindly provided by DNA Technology .
In the following, coding sequences are colored blue, restriction sites are colored green and nucleotides that are both are shown in orange.
The mutation sites in the FlhDC mutation primers are shown in purple.

(*) Mutation primers were designed to introduce a silent mutation at position 822 in the operon to eliminate an illegal PstI site.
(**) Due to the formation of hairpin structures of primers ninaB fw and ninaB rv, new primers were designed containing only the innermost restriction sites (XbaI and SpeI).
