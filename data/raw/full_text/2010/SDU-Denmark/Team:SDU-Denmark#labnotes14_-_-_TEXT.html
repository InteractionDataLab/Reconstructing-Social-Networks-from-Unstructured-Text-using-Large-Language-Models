Restriction digest on K343002 and PSB1C3
Date: 12/10
Done by: Tommy
Methods: Restriction digest
Protocols: RD1.3 [2]
Notes:
EcoRI and SpeI were used, the producted was purifided on a gel
nanodrop:
PSB1C3: 41,6
K343002: 64,5
Ligation of K343002 into PSB1C3
Date: 12/10
Done by: Marie & Christian
Methods: Ligation
Protocols: LG1.1 [3]
Notes:
For each of the ligations three ligation mixtures were prepared. vector concentrations of 41,6ng/uL (PSB1C3) was used for mixture. Appropiate amount of insert was added to reach vector:insert ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 respectively.
Ligation mixtures (B0015 in pSB3C5):

Transformations of K343002 in PSB1C3 into top10 E. Coli
Date: 12/10
Done by: Tommy
Methods: Ligation
Protocols: LG1.1 [4]
Notes:
16 colonies and RFP control was selected from the colonie PCR. All of the colonies contain K343002 in PSB1C3
VF2 and VR primers was used

Coloni PCR on transformations of K343002 in PSB1C3
Date: 30/09
Done by: Tommy
Methods: PCR
Protocols: CP1.3 [5]
Notes:
Because the first coloni PCR of the transformants didn't give us the the right pieces 32 new colonies where chosen:
1-16: ninaB in PSB1C3
VF2 and VR used as primers in the TAQ PCR:
