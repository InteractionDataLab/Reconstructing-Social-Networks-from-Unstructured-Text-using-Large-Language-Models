Team:SDU-Denmark/project
From 2010.igem.org
Project!
We have choosen the project, which is "Mechanical work"! You can read more on our blog. This page will be updated soon.
Summary may 30th 2010
Planning of our research, before our trip to Paris 1. Membrane proteins + stimuli 2. PilG + PilH (the pili creating/degrading genes) + check out the E. coli’s pili-generating system. 3. Pili’s in general + receptorproteins. The groups must research the general mechanisms, and figure out which biobricks already exist, and which must be created (lowest priority). Post about in on Wave, and create a piece of text (abstract-like) which, in easy terms, explains your discoveries, so that the other groups easily can access and read up on it. The groups must individually meet once a week, before Paris. Perhaps a 2 hour meeting, where everyone gets updated on each other’s subject? We will not be researching beads yet, as (we hope) FLiNT (Center for Fundamental Living Technology) already knows a lot on this subject. We are not creating any definitive lab-groups yet, as we aren’t sure of how many lab groups is needed for this summer project.
After Paris
Having Biobricks sequenced, and gaining labskills.
When must the final system be “thought through”?
iGEM itself has a deadline, where we must hand in our project description which says august, and therefore decided to have our own internal deadline at the start of august.
Calendar
People must be aware of when they are going away on a holiday.
Name
There will be poll on our Wave, regarding the final name of our project. Proposals are welcome. The one, who brings the winning name, gets to have a yellow coat (Tour de France is going on, which is having a bit influence on us). Logo-competition: Draw your idea of a mE.chanic (or something of the likes), and win an E. Cola and a dotted coat.
Coats
There’s talk about coats, sponsored by IDA, perhaps for free, or perhaps partially for free. Naturally, we will have a red, green and a dotted coat. (Sheila has the info, regarding this).
Driving to Paris
People driving the cars will be: Car 7 Mike Sheila
Car 10 Søren  Janni  Tommy Will there be beer in the car? And is it possible to drink for 14 hours straight? Who wants to go home early? Eddie, LC (who else?) Must be brought along: CD’s, some way to play movies, beer etc.
The Wiki
The summaries of our meetings will now be written in English , and more text and pictures will appear. Stay tuned!
