dobbelt transformation of K343005 in PSB1C3 and K274210 in PSB1A2 in to top10 and MG1655 E. Coli
Date: 1/10
Done by: Tommy & Marie
Methods: transformation
Protocols: TR1.1 [2]
Notes:
Top10 and MG1655 E. coli competent cells where prepared according to protocol
Minipreps of K343005 and K274210 was used
1uL of K343005 and 3uL of K274210 was used becaus og their differens in concentration. The rest was done accordin to the transformations protocol.

Miniprep on ninaB in PSB1C3 and K343005 in PSB1AK3
Date: 2/10
Done by: Tommy
Methods: Miniprep
Protocols: MP1.2 [4]
Notes:
Colonies 34 and 37 contain ninaB in PSB1C3
Colonies 61 and 63 contain K343005 in PSB1AK3
The miniprep was done according to protocol
The minipreps was dryed down and sendt to seqvensing
Further Characterization of BBa_K274210 in MG1655 and TOP10
Date: 3/10
Done by: Tommy
Methods: Miniprep
Protocols: MP1.2 [5]
Notes:
Further characterization of the BioBrick K274210 has been performed in Top10 and MG1655 E. coli. The experimental data have shown somewhat similar results for Top10 and MG1655 E. coli.  The experiment was performed as follows:
Over night (ON) cultures were grown from 4 colonies, until the following OD’s were obtained:
Top 10 - no insert                OD = 0,008 (100 x diluted)
Top 10 - with K274210 insert   OD = 0,011 (100 x diluted)
MG1655 - no insert   OD = 0,020 (100 x diluted)
Mg1655 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,017 (100 x diluted)
ON cultures were grown in 110 ml LB media. Colonies with K274210 insert were grown in LB media containing ampicillin. All ON cultures were grown for 20 hours at 37 °C. After 16 hours, 10 ml of the ON cultures were transferred into 110 ml LB media and grown for 4 hours to reach the exponential phase, where the following OD’s were obtained:
Top 10 - no insert   OD = 0,049 (100 x diluted)
Top 10 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,044 (100 x diluted)
MG1655 - no insert   OD = 0,007 (100 x diluted)
Mg1655 - with K274210 insert  OD = 0,009 (100 x diluted)
Cultures with K274210 insert were grown in media containing ampicillin. 100 mL cell culture were centrifuged for 5 min at 14000 RPM. The supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 5 mL acetone (99,9%), except the Top 10 E. coli with the K274210 insert, which was resuspended in 10 mL acetone (source of error). The resuspended cells were sonicated for 5 min. Samples were spun down, the supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and cell debris was discarded. A standard curve was made from pure beta-carotene.
The samples at the OD’s seen above as well as solutions of pure beta-carotene with known concentrations were measured at a fixed wavelength of 456 nm.  Known concentrations and their absorbances:

UV-VIS absorbance spectra of the known solutions were obtained, as well as spectra of the samples at the ODs shown above. The spectra of Top 10 and MG1655 in the stationary phase as well as selected spectra of known solutions are shown below:
These results were obtained from one experiment, which will be replicated later for more precision.
