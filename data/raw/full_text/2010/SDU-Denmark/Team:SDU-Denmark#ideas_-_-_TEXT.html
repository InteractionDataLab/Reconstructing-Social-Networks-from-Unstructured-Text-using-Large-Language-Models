Ideas
05/03/2010:
We have created some models for how a reset mechanism could work in a bacteria, here are some sketches:
MelA is the gene that codes for a Tyrosinase, which makes melanin.
I is an inhibitor of the MelA gene.
MelA-K is a gene which codes for a protein that degrades melanin.
MelA-KD destroys/inhibits the MelA-K protein.
The idea is that a certain stimulus leads to inhibition of the MelA gene, so that no more additional melanin will be produced. Since the expression of the MelA-KD protein, which inactivates MelA-K (K for killer ;-) ), is coupled to the expression of MelA, the expression of this protein will also stop. Therefore the MelA-K protein will be functional and degrade the remaining melanin in the bacteria. This in turn leads to turning the black bacteria white (back to its natural color). Removing the inhibition will turn the bacteria black again (reset it).
The idea with this mechanism is to express the MelA gene via the activator, A, through our set-signal, which is symbolized by the square. (...)

We have narrowed our ideas down to the final five. The five candidates for our project are:
Creating distinct compartments in a bacteria.
A Stereoisomer sorting/converting bacteria.
Remote controlling a biological machine.
A reset switch for cells.
Bacteria that produce mechanical work.
A more detailed write up is following in the next few days.
04/19/2010:
The last 15 ideas are chosen, they were narrowed down from around 50 projects since the last meeting.
