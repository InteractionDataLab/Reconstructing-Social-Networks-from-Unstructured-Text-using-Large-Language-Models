The use of biosensors is important in the detection of varying chemicals that induce reactions on promoters in gene sequences thus emitting a form of measurable output. The advantages of environmental biosensors over the current methods are the portability, relatively low cost, and environmentally friendly characteristics of microorganisms over bulky equipment.  Biosensors have potential to be maintained on-site able to monitor conditions continuously in the soil or marine environments without significant effort being placed into the maintenance as is
customary in expensive equipment that must be maintained and used by skilled workers. 
</P><P>For traditional “offsite” laboratory testing, the samples must be sent in, proving to be a costly and ineffective method. The new trend towards biosensors aims to “provide fast, reliable, and sensitive measurements with lower cost; many of them aimed at on-site analysis.” <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[2] </A>Most biosensor systems have focused on the use of bacterial organisms, while the use of eukaryotic organisms is rare.

</P><P>Facts: 
</P><UL><LI>The United States uses 700 million gallons of oil a day <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[3] </A></LI><LI>Oil has many uses in human activities: fuel source, lubricate machinery, make plastics, make medicines and pesticides, make asphalt <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[3] </A></LI><LI>Natural seepage of crude oil from geologic formations below the seafloor is estimated to exceed <B>47,000,000</B> gallons in North American waters and <B>180,000,000</B> gallons globally every year <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[3] </A></LI></UL><P>Oil spills cause the oil to float on the saltwater of the ocean, spreading out rapidly across the surface of the water to create a thin sheen. The methods of clean up for oil spills include booms, floating barriers to oil, skimmers, sorbents, dispersants, in-situ burning, vacuum trucks, and washing. <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[3] </A></P><P>There are four major sources of pollution: naturally occurring oil seeps, extraction, transportation, consumption. Despite popular thought, the oil spills caused by transportation and disasters only constitute a small portion of the oil that enters marine environments every year. The following charts based on information provided by the Ocean Studies Board and Marine Board of the National Academy of Sciences, show the percentage of oil contamination as per each category of source of pollution. <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[3] </A></P><CENTER><B>Source:</B> From Oil in the Sea, Ocean Studies Board and Marine Board of the National Academy of Sciences (2003). </CENTER><P>
Similarly, oil spills have differing impacts depending on a variety of factors including location, size, and temperature. However, the size of an oil spill does not necessarily dictate the impact that an oil spill will have on a marine environment; rather, the impact of an oil spill depends on its location.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Deepwater_Horizon_Oil_Spill">Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</SPAN></H1><P>The <I>Deepwater Horizon</I> Oil Spill, referred to also as the BP Oil Spill and the Gulf Oil Spill, is a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that is currently the largest oil spill in America’s history with hundreds of millions of gallons of oil spilled. Following a deep oil rig explosion occurring on April 20, 2010 killing 11 workers, the leak has been gushing oil.

</P><P>The<I> Deepwater Horizon</I> Oil Spill had caused serious backlash and worry over the environment surrounding the impacted oil rig, and the toxic compounds and environmental hazards of oil have been looked into again in order to create an efficient clean up of the oil spill. 
</P><P>The toxic compounds in oil vary, but some of the most worrisome of compounds are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including napthalenes, benzene, toluene, and xylenes not only to the environment but to humans as well.  According to experts, the ecology nearest to the spill and in the upper water column will be greatly affected and “contamination could ultimately end up having cascading effects up the food chain.” According to the article, “when an oil spill occurs, there are no good outcomes.” <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[4] </A></P><P>The northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone, an “underwater area with little or no oxygen known commonly as the ‘dead zone”’<A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[5] </A>, has been predicted to grow and be negatively affected by the growing crisis with the Gulf Oil spill. There is evidence of underwater oil plumes which could be attributed to BP’s injection of chemical dispersants at the source of the leak. “These reports found that the high pressure of oil released from a deepwater blowout causes droplets and bubbles to form. Natural gas also rushes into the ocean, joins the crude, and helps form a buoyant plume of oil and gas. As this plume rises, it pulls in dense water from the ocean’s depths. Eventually, the denser water in the mixture slows the plume’s ascent.” <A href="/Team:UTDallas/Background#References" title="Team:UTDallas/Background">[6] </A> The more time that oil spends in the water, the more time the components of oil – including the more toxic compounds such as the PAHs and aromatic compounds – have to dissolve into the water and affect the aquatic ecosystem. Also, there are reports over the actual values of biodegradation occurring in the ocean environments. Typically, biodegradation occurring in marine environments is measured through the depletion of oxygen; however, some critics of dispersant use claim that the decreased oxygen use could actually be caused by oil- eating microbes consuming particles of the dispersant rather than the intended petroleum.
