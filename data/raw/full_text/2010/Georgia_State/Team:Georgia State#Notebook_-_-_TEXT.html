Extracted and plated with LB on agar. Poor plates. Discussion: This experiment failed at some point as noted by the lack of bands after running a gel to isolate the 9A plasmid backbone. The successful banding patterns by Kristin’s PUC  plasmid indicate that the error occurred in either the restriction digest or during the purification process. It is most likely that the problem was in the restriction digest. The enzymes used were fast-digest enzymes and were not inactivated after the 5 min incubation. They were placed at room temperature for approximately an hour before being purified. It is believed that the enzymes continued to digest the DNA to completion. Future attempts should require a quicker transition time from the digest, an inactivation step, and potential postponing of the purification step until after the ligation has been performed.

Joe “Isolation of pGAP, pAOX1, FLD1” The purpose of this experiment is to isolate the parts pGAP, pAOX1, and FLD1 from DNA of P. pastoris through PCR rxn. 2 sets of primers have been designed for each part. The first set of each contains an Xba site on the forward primer and a Spe1 site on the reverse. The second set of primers adds EcoRI, Not1, and Xba to the forward and Spe1, Not !, and Pst onto the reverse primer. The second product of the second set will yield a biobrick product, ready for insertion into plasmid _______. However, because adding 3 restriction enzyme sties decreases primer quality, hybrid reactions will be run to increase likelihood of obtaining a useable product. Methods Tube # FLD1  F1 (F) 8286 (R) 8287 F2 (F) 8286 (R) 8289 F3 (F) 8288 (R) 8287 F4 (F) 8288 (R) 8289 Product: X—S, X—SNP, ENX---S, ENX---SNP → high temp  pGAP  G1 (F) 1148 (R) 1149 G2 (F) 1148 (R) 8285 G3 (F) 8284 (R) 1149 G4 (F) 8284 (R) 8285 X---S, X---SNP, ENX---S, ENX---SNP → high temp  pAOX1  A1 (F) 1146 (R) 1147 A2 (F) 1146 (R) 8283 A3 (F) 8282 (R) 1147 A4 (F) 8282 (R) 8283 X---S, X---SNP, ENX---S, SNX---SNP → high temp For each reaction, the following ratio was used: 12.5 µL MasterMix, 1 µL forward primer, 1 µL reverse primer, 1 µL 58 ng/µL Pichia DNA, 9.5 µL H2O. 25 µL total. [ran gel] F: 1.3 Kb (contains EcoRI site! Must use different enzyme!) A: .9 Kb (Gel showed successful amplification of all samples except F1) G: .5 Kb For isolating pGAP, the FR sample showed the strongest bands. However, it was inaccessible from extraction.

How to Prepare a Gel
Need: 1.2% agarose and .001 % Bio-red Examples 35 ml gel → 0.42 g Agarose          35 ml 1X TAE          3.5 µL Bio-Red  Or 75 ml gel → 0.9 g Agarose          75 ml 1X TAE          7.5 µL H₂O  1. Add weighed amount of agarose to flask 2. Add 1X TAE 3. Microwave for ~60 seconds, stirring occasionally 4. Prepare gel tray with desired wells in place 5. Add Bio-Red after microwaving, swirl to mix, and pour into gel tray. 6. Let solidify for at least 30 minutes.  7. Remove wells.
Gel Electroporation A₄ & G₄ → The ligated parts were ran in a gel to check if the ligation was successful.  The purified % digested F₄ and RFP were ran on a gel to check if they were successful.  Ladder F₄ A₄ G₄ RFP Ladder - None   -  -    -  -  - -   -      -
Ran at 120 V, 200 mA, for 60 minutes. Results: Two bands were located in the RFP lane  Indicates: 1- RFP (part) 2- Plasmid backbone. A₄ & G₄- -1 band in each lane around 3000 base pairs. This could possibly indicate that the past was  ligated into the plasmid backbone.
Transformation A₄ &G₄ were transformed using the heat shock protocol.  Results: - No growth on LB with ampicillin plates for either part.  - LB plates displayed viability. - Primers needed to be made to amplify the ligated part because the gel reveals evidence of ligation, but transformation not successful.
