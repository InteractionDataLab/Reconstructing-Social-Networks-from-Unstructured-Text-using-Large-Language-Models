Pichia Pastoris as a host organism for iGEM
Pichia pastoris is a methylotrophic yeast used as an alternative host for protein production in addition to Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There are several reasons why P. Pastoris is an ideal host organism. Its ability to perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications, high yields of recombinant protein, and its genetic similarity to S. cerevisiae are very attractive traits (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000).
Because of these reasons, P.pastoris has quickly gained popularity for recombinant protein production. The Georgia State 2010 team believes P. pastoris would be an excellent chassis for the iGEM competition. Our goal is to provide a tool box of parts necessary for the genetic manipulation of this organism. Parts will include a plasmid backbone, several parts providing alternative selectivity options and promoter systems In addition, our tool box will be used to produce a flu virus antigen in P. pastoris as an example of how this system could be used for vaccine production. We hope our contributions will enable future users to maximize the use and further explore the incredible potential P. pastoris has to offer!
