Protocols
Dip and swirl cloning
This protocol is essentially the same as the Standard BioBrick Cloning protocol used in our lab with the exception of using a minimal amount of restriction enzymes.
Restriction Digest
Add 0.3 μl of 10X NEBbuffer 2
Add 0.3 μl 0f 10X BSA
Add 30 ng of DNA (plasmid or PCR product)
Dip the pipette tip in the enzyme solution and move it around (swirl). Place the tip in your reaction mixture, move it around (swirl) again, and rinse it.
Add water to a final volume of 3 μl.
The remaining steps of the protocol are identical to that of the Standard BioBrick Cloning protocol.
N.B. This protocol is particularly suitable for when the enzyme solution has almost run out, but you still need to perform a number of digestions. This protocol is longer than the Standard BioBrick Cloning protocol. In addition, if the level of the enzyme solution is high, the capillarity action causes more than enough of the enzyme to enter the tip, hence, rendering this approach pointless.
Yeast Colony PCR
This is a quick extraction of yeast genomic DNA for performing PCR amplification.
Transfer one yeast colony, in sterile conditions, to a 50 μl solution containing the following: 3 μl of 10 mg/ml zymolase and 47 μl water.
Suspend the colony in the solution using a pipette.
Incubate the cell suspension for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Denature the enzyme by incubating the suspension for 10 minutes at 95°C.
5 μl of the cell suspension should be used in a 50 μl PCR reaction mixture.
10 mg/ml zymolase solution
Add the following to a 15 mL tube,
100 mg of Zymolase 20T
0.5 ml of sterile Tris-HCl with pH 7.5
4.5 ml of ddH2O
Shake gently to dissolve.
Add 5 ml of 50% (w/v) filter-sterilized glycerol.
Make aliquots depending on your need and store at -20°C.

Preparation of chemically competent cells CCMB 80 method
This protocol has been used with the TOP10 and Mach1 E. coli cell strains from Invitrogen
Preparation
All glassware MUST be detergent free, detergents severely inhibit transformation efficiency of competent cells. An easy way to ensure that glassware is detergent free is to autoclave it half full with ddH¬2O.
All glassware and tubes used for the actual generation of the competent cells MUST be pre-chilled
Generation of seed stocks
Streak TOP10 cells on an SOB plate and grow for single colonies at room temperature.
Pick single colonies into 2 ml of SOB medium and shake overnight at room temperature.
Add glycerol to 15% (vol) and aliquot 250 μL samples to -80 °C freezer tubes.
Store at -80 °C indefinitely.
Preparing competent cells
Inoculate 250 μL seed stock into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL SOB medium. Grow at room temperature until a cell density of 5 × 107 cells/ml is reached.
Collect the cell suspension into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and chill on ice for 10 min. (Take a 10 μL aliquot to determine the density of viable cells by plating a 106 dilution onto a SOB agar plate).
Pellet the cells at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Decant the supernatant and invert the tubes to remove excess culture medium. Resuspend the cells in 17 mL of CCMB 80 by gentle vortexing of the centrifuge tube.
Incubate on ice for 20 min. Centrifuge for 10 min at 1000 g at 4°. Decant as in Step 3. Resuspend the cells in 4 mL of CCMB 80.
Aliquot 200 μL volumes of the cells into prechilled eppendorf tubes and then stored at -80 °C.

Then prepare a solution of 10 mM potassium acetate, 10% glycerol (v/v) using these reagents and the purest available water. Add salts as solids and allow each to enter into solution before adding the next. Adjust pH to 6.4 with 0.1 N HCl. Do not adjust pH upward with base.
