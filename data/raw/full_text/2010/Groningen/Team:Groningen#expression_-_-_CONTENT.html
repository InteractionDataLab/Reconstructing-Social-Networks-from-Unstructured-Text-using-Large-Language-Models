However, first we needed to test whether <I>B. subtilis</I> was capable of expressing chaplins, since they could impair the cellgrowth due to their hydrophobic and self assembling properties. We succesfully expressed chaplins C, E and H in <I>B. subtilis</I> using a tightly regulated subtilin inducable system called &quot;SURE&quot;. Furthermore we tested the SURE system for optimal subtilin concentration with GFP. We want <I>B. subtilis</I> to auto-induce the expression of the chaplins after biofilmformation. Therefore we looked into two operons in <I>B. subtilis</I>; one that gets triggered in late exponential growth (<I>srfA</I> operon) and one that is involved in the formation of biofilm (<I>yqxM-sipW-tasA</I> operon). Using the <I>srfA</I> promoter (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K305007" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K305007</A>), we succesfully expressed GFP demonstrating that this promoter could be used to auto-induce the expression chaplins.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Subtilin_induced_expression_of_chaplins">Subtilin induced expression of chaplins</SPAN></H3><P>The biofilm forming capacity of <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> makes it a good host for our application. In addition, <I>B. subtilis</I> is known for its ability to produce and secrete large amounts of protein at high cell densities. However, despite its track record as an efficient production organism and the fact that both <I>B. subtilis</I> and <I>Streptomyces coelicolor</I> are gram-positive bacteria, it is not certain wether chaplins can be heterologously expressed in <I>B. subtilis</I>. Improper folding, unsuccessful export, or even the very nature of the chaplins, could still lead to hampered expression.
We took several steps to ensure optimal expression. The coding sequences of the chaplins were codon optimized for <I>B. subtilis</I> and synthesized. We placed a ribosome binding site in front of the coding sequences that is known to work well in <I>B. subtilis</I>, and flanked these constructs with the biobrick prefix and suffix. 
</P><P><B>SURE expression system</B></P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Subtilin induction of GFP by the SURE system (Bongers <I>et al</I>, 2005)</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Because it is uncertain how chaplin expression will affect <I>B. subtilis</I>, the initial expression attempts were performed with the stringently controlled, subtilin-regulated gene expression (SURE) system (Bongers <I>et al</I>, 2005). This system uses the subtilin sensing machinery present in a strain of <I>B. subtilis</I> that autoinduces the production of more of the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantibiotics" class="external text" rel="nofollow">lantibiotic</A> subtilin. The subtilin sensor histidine kinase SpaK phosphorylates the response regulator SpaR, which can then bind to so-called <I>spa</I> boxes in the promoter regions of genes involved in subtilin biosynthesis (Kleerebezem <I>et al</I>, 2004). In the SURE system, a <I>B. subtilis</I> strain naturally lacking the subtilin biosynthesis and regulation genes has the <I>spaRK</I> genes introduced into its genome. A plasmid carrying a <I>spa</I> box promoter that is transformed to this strain can then drive the expression of proteins upon subtilin induction of SpaRK signalling.

We introduced the BioBrick prefix and suffix into the expression plasmid, downstream of the mutated <I>spaS</I> promoter, producing our subtilin inducible expression backbone part, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K305011" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K305011</A>. To test the expression and find a suitable subtilin concentration for induction of the chaplins we made use of GFP fluorescence measurements. We inserted the part <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_E0240" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_E0240</A> into the BioBrick site and induced liquid cultures of <I>B. subtilis</I> carrying this plasmid (and the <I>spaRK</I> genes) with different volumes of subtilin-containing culture supernatant of a subtilin producing strain of <I>B. subtilis</I>. These results demonstrate that addition of 0.5 to 1%(vol/vol) of subtilin to the culture is sufficient to reach optimal induction.
</P><P><B>Chaplin detection</B>
In our first expression tests we focused on detecting the chaplins in either the medium in which our chaplin producing population grows 

Using the same methods that were used to dissolve and monomerize chaplins from Streptomyces, we treated cell pellets and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichloricacetic_acid" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TCA</A> precipitated supernatant with <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TFA</A> to purify chaplin proteins. <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TFA</A> treatment with 99% pure TFA breaks down most proteins and monomerises assembled chaplin fibers, this enables us to detect the chaplins on SDS gel. 
</P><P>
Since our early expression experiments didn't yield conclusive results regarding the detection of our chaplins, we tried staining our samples with an amyloid specific stain called <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioflavin" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Thioflavin T</A>. Initial testing with the supernatant and washed pellet gave [intriguing resultsGr] yet not clear.  Our emission graphs showed some irregularities with the subtilin induced samples, but seemed to be distorted by background noise caused by other materials in the sample. To further purify our samples we decided to [extractioncellwallsGR disrupt] our liquid culture and boil it two times in 2% SDS, before treating the freeze dried sample with 99%. TFA Using such a harsh  method, we hope to denaturate most proteins to prevent their interference in chaplin detection and highten the relative concentration of chaplin proteins in tested samples, this turned out to be a more successful method.
</P><P>Using this method we succesfully detected chaplins C, E and H in purified cell walls from induced B. subtilis cultures, confirmation of these results was provided by malditov mass spectrometry.

We assume that an ideal promoter would not be active until the biofilm has formed because the expression of hydrophobic proteins might influence the formation of it. Two promoters where found that are active in biofilms but not during normal growth. 
</P><P><I><B>srfA</B></I></P><P>The <A href="http://dbtbs.hgc.jp/COG/prom/srfAA-srfAB-comS-srfAC-srfAD.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>srfA</I> operon</A> has been reported to be important for natural competence and sporulation in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. All these activities occur in biofilms, the promoter is not active until the end of exponential growth. It is controlled by the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Groningen/Expression_model#ComXPA_quorum_sensing_system" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ComXPA quorum sensing system</A> and hence active in states of high cell densities. Therefore the <I>srfA</I> promoter would be suitable for chaplin expression. Two different lengths of the <I>srfA</I> promoter where chosen due to uncertainties concerning the region between the response element and the transcription start side of the SrfAA protein. In the original promoter this region is unusually long, by shortening it 190bp’s we hope to achieve a higher transcription efficiency. So we came up with two different promoters, the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K305008" class="external text" rel="nofollow">original</A> one and the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K305007" class="external text" rel="nofollow">shortened</A> one. We followed the promoter activity by placing a RBS+GFP BioBrick downstream of these promoters. We succesfully demonstrated that the short <I>srfA</I>-promoter variant drives the expression of GFP in a cell density dependent way. However, as can be seen in the image below, the fluorescence starts increasing during early exponential growth, rather than late exponential growth. This might be because this multi-copy plasmid system is more sensitive to srfA promoter activators. It could also be caused by our removal of the sequences downstream of the regulator binding sites and upstream of the srfA coding sequence. These sequences may have a regulatory role, preventing transcription/translation at earlier growth stages.

It is needed for biofilm formation because TasA is a key protein of the extracellular matrix. The promotor gets activated via a cascade of other regulatory elements, including SrfA, in response to quorum sensing. Since the chaplins should work in a similar way to TasA we think the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K305006" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>yqxM</I></A> promoter would be very suitable for chaplin expression during the stationary phase. We fused the yqxM promoter with GFP but could not observe any expression, since the GFP worked with the srfA promoter we conclude that the yqxM promoter does not work.
