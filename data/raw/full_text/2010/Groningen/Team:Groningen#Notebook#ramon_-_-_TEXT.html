If I ever write here it means I have sold out and betrayed everything I stand for. Notes are for loosers!! If its not worth remembering its not worth writing down. Unless you are some amnesia guy like that dude from Memento. Which was not as good as I expected but im going to reference it anyway because it makes the point I am painfully trying to make here but can't seem to get done. I mean if I just referenced a good movie like Scooby Doo or something you would be all like "Yeah that was a cool movie allright but what is he trying to tell me here?" So in short, sorry for citing Memento which was only a decent movie but I lack a better example. What are you doing in my notebook anyway?
