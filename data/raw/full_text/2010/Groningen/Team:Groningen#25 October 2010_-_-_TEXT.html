David, Arend Jan and Peter
Growing transformants with GFP labeled SrfA and yqxM promotors. To see when the cell density dependant quorum sensing system kicks in to activate the promotors, sequential cultures were inoculated every our at an OD of 0.1. After 7 hours, the OD from the sequential cultures was measured together with the GFP fluorescence.

Biofilm paste experiment
Growing biofilms on sterilized ceramics that have been coated with athin layer of TY medium with corn starch.
Mix: 30 mg cornstarch/ml TY 1% agar medium and 0.5% glucose
After dissolving the agar and addition of corn starch teh pieces of cermics we added an taken out
Expression experiment David & Peter
Massspec data for the induced cultures of E, EN, C and CN was aquired, with the help of Sander we performed Malditov mass spectometry on both these samples and the samples in stock from the large E induction experiment. The samples of the E-induction experiment gave no data.
