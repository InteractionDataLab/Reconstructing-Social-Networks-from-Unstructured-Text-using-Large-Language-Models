Chaplin ladder on gel-Peter
The Yqxm and the Srfa (both variants)promoters where extracted from genomic Bacillus Subtilis DNA via PCR and inserted into the PNZ8901 plasmid. All transformations where done in Lactococcus Lactis. Restriction analysis was performed to check the constructs. The concentrations where determined with the Nanodrop

Biofilm paste experiment
Growing biofilms on sterilized ceramics that have been coated with athin layer of TY medium with corn starch.
Mix: 30 mg cornstarch/ml TY 1% agar medium and 0.5% glucose
After dissolving the agar and addition of corn starch teh pieces of cermics we added an taken out
