Team:Groningen/Protocols for Bacillus subtilis 168
From 2010.igem.org
2-step transformation procedure for Bacillus subtilis 168
Cells are grown O/N at 37 °C in supplemented medium contains Spizizen's salts (without antibiotics)
Dilute cells 10X in fresh medium (10 ml) and grow for 3 h at 37 °C, shaking
Make agar plates
Cells are then diluted 1:1 in starvation medium (prewarmed, no antibiotic)
After 2 hours, approx. 1 μg DNA (BRB689; Cmr amyQ+) is added to 100 μl cells in a 2 ml tube, and the mixture is incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (200 rpm)
Dilute 3-fold in prewarmed TY medium and plate after another 45 min (37 °C;200 rpm)
Dilutions (in starvation medium) for plating are:
* 10^0 and 10^-1 on selective media * 10^-5 on non-selective plates (viable count)
