Team:Groningen/Normal SDS-PAGE using Tris-Glycine Gels and Electrophoresis Buffer
From 2010.igem.org
Wear gloves at all times!
Requirements:
30% acrylamide(Biorad) NEUROTOXIN!
4X separation gel buffer: 1.5M Tris.HCl, 0.4% SDS pH6.8
4X stacking gel buffer: 0.5M Tris.HCl, 1.92M glycine, 1% SDS water saturated isobutanol
TEMED( in yellow cabinet )
10% APS (Ammonium persulfate) ; prepare 10 ml and keep cold in fridge
Hoeffer Mighty gel system Casting of the gel:
Per gel take one small glass plate with 'ears', one big white ceramic plate, two grey spacers with perpendicular plastic bits (0.75 mm), and one white comb (0.75 mm)
Clean the plates etc with soap, rinse with demiwater and ethanol, and dry
Assemble the system in the gel casting holder. Mark the line of separation/stacking
Mix the separation gel in 10 ml plastic tube:
for 2 gels Seperation gel (0.75 mm) 12.5% 16% 30% acrylamide                      4 ml             5.1 ml    4X separation buffer                2.4 ml           2.4 ml    MQ                                  3.2 ml           2.1 ml    10% APS                             28 μl            28 μl    TEMED                               28 μl            28 μl
Pipet the separation gel mix immediately in between the glass plates until the marked line is reached
Pipet water-saturated isobutanol on top of the polymerizing separation gel
Let the separation gel polymerize completely before preparing the stacking gel
When the gel is polymerized, discard the isobutanol and wash the gel with water
Mix the stacking gel in a 10 ml tube:
for 2 gels mQ                               1.92 ml    4X stacking buffer               0.83 ml    30% acrylamide                   560 μl    10% APS                          14 μl    TEMED                            7 μl
Pipet the stacking gel mix immediately on top of the separation gel and place the comb without air bubbles. Mark the teeth of the comb with a marker
Let the gel polymerize (5-30 min); check also the remaining gelmix in the tube
Disassemble the gel casting holder and take out the gel/plates
Use the gel immediately or seal the gel in plastic seal bags and store at 4 °C
Assembly of the Tris-Glycine gel in the electrophoresis unit
Take the electrophoresis unit of the Hoeffer system and place it next to a power unit
Dilute 10X and pour 1X electrophoresis buffer in the container( roughly 1 cm high)
Place gel in the buffer without air bubbles under the gel
Use the red clamps to place the gel tightly in the unit
Pour 1X electrophoresis buffer in the chamber so that the top of the gel is immersed
Take the comb out of the gel and rinse the wells using a hooked needle and syringe
Runninge of the gel
Prepare the samples in 1X SDS sample buffer (NOT nucleic acid loading buffer)
Boil the samples for 5 min and spin down
Pipet the samples and protein marker carefully into the wells
Place the electrode cap on the unit and press lightly.Put the other side of the electrode cables in the correct holes of the power unit
Switch on the power unit and run until the blue front is appr. 1 cm from the end of the gel. Alternatively, use the prestained protein marker to identify the exact point of stopping
Disassemble the electrophoresis unit and take the gel
Take one plate off and cut one corner away for positioning purpose
Carefully bring the gel into a clean staining container using some demi water and/or spacers
Stain the gel with CBB or silver
