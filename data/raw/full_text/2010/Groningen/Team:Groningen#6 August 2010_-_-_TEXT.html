Modellers: After our visit with biofilm model expert Van Loosdrecht we looked deeper into our model. The idea is now to model diffusion and gene expression into the existing models. We stumbled upon an interesting quorum sensing pathway when looking in the partsregistry. The comXPA system seems to be exactly what we need to get our chaplins expressed after biofilm formation has started. Joël, Laura, Djoke
