Biobricks
Here is our registry of our biobricks: <groupparts>iGEM010 Groningen</groupparts>
Summary:
Below is given a short description of all the biobricks in our registry.
Chaplins
<partinfo>BBa_K305001</partinfo> Hydrophobic protein chaplin C (chpC)
Strongly hydrophobic protein originating from Streptomyces coelicolor and codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis.
<partinfo>BBa_K305002</partinfo> chaplin C (chpDC) with modified sortase binding motive
Strongly hydrophobic protein originating from Streptomyces coelicolor and codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis.
Modified C-terminal Sortase(SrtA from S. aureus.) recognition site.
<partinfo>BBa_K305003</partinfo> Hydrophobic protein chaplin E (chpE)
Strongly hydrophobic protein originating from Streptomyces coelicolor and codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis.
<partinfo>BBa_K305004</partinfo> Hydrophobic protein chaplin H (chpH)
Strongly hydrophobic protein originating from Streptomyces coelicolor and codon optimized for Bacillus subtilis.
<partinfo>BBa_K305005</partinfo> Sortase srtA
Staphylococcus aureus sortase, an enzyme that anchors surface proteins to the cell wall
Promotors
<partinfo>BBa_K305006</partinfo> yqxMpr
yqxM promotor effective in biofilm formation, regulates tasA production
<partinfo>BBa_K305007</partinfo> srfApr 1
Promotor for the surfactin regulatory gene.
<partinfo>BBa_K305008</partinfo> srfApr 2
Promotor for the surfactin regulatory gene.
<partinfo>BBa_K305009</partinfo> srfApr1>GFP
Promotor for the surfactin regulatory gene with GFP.
<partinfo>BBa_K305010</partinfo> srfApr2>GFP
Promotor for the surfactin regulatory gene with GFP.
Plasmid Backbone
<partinfo>BBa_K305011</partinfo> Subtilin inducible expression plasmid for Bacillus subtilis
Adapted from the system for subtilin-regulated gene expression (SURE) in Bacillus subtilis [1], this plasmid was  constructed to express proteins present in RCF 10 BioBricks upon subtilin induction.
