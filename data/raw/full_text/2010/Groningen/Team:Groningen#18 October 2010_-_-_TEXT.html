Expression experiment contruct E&H chaplin and C chaplin. Growing in batches of 0.5 L liquid TY medium at 37 degrees. Inoculation with overnight culture with a starting OD of 0.1. Inducing at an OD of 0.5 with 1.5% subtilin overnight. Harvesting the overnight culture and washing pellet before disrupting it.

measurements in Bremen on surface activity of chaplin coated objects
We wanted to know if there was an effect of our chaplin proteins on surface drag in the water. To test this we wanted to measure the water resistance of a spindel shaped object in the water at different speeds. First do the measurements with a clean spindel and secondly after coating the spindel with purified chaplins from streptomyces. The spindle that was used for the mesurements, this shapes is designed minimize the effect of shape of the objects drag. Thereby maximizing the effect of surface resistance on the drag coeffient.
