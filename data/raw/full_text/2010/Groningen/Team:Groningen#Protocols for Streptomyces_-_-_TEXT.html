Team:Groningen/Protocols for Streptomyces
From 2010.igem.org
Growth condition
-Make plates with a thick layer of medium, 100 ml medium per big Petri dish.Medium of Streptomyces is mannitol soya flour medium (MS or SFM) 300 ml per 1L bottle to avoid boiling over in autoclave
Agar                           6 g
D-mannitol                     6 g
Soya flour                     6 g
Demiwater                      300ml
Plating ΔrdeAB spores          10^5 /plate
-Incubate for 7 days at 30 °C
-Harvest mycelium with razorblade
Cell wall isolation
-Scrape the mycelium with a razor blade and resuspend in 15 mL demi-water.
-Run this suspension throught the cell disrupter at 13 kpsi 6X:
Clean all the parts off the cell distrupter with 70% ethanol, including the tower, make sure the nozzle is not blocked by running some ethanol through it.
Let the loading cilinder and the nozzle rest in ice on aluminium foil for 5/10 minutes to cool them off(prevents protease activity later on).
Filtrate your samples using a 10 mL surringe and the filter device, catch your filtrate in a clean greiner tube.
Press the loading cilinder on the tower tightl (don't be to careful)
Load no more than 15 mL of your filtered suspension
Put on the nozzle and the lit of the nozzle, tightly
The big cilinder can be placed on top of the nozzle/ loading cilinder, twist and turn to get it on and align the dent at the bottom of the cilinder with the dent on the french press
Adjust your pressure to 13 kpsi
Use the pin to start the machine, after two loud klblam!'s remove it
Collect the distrupted cells( they are in the nozzle), using a surringe of 10 mL
Run it through another 5X
Collect your severely distrupted cells using the surringe, collect them in a greiner tube and put that on ice
Clean all parts of the french style cell distrupter with 70% ethanol
-Cook in 2% SDS (spin off your French press samples- 5000 rpm and 5 min- then add 2% SDS)
-Spin off, 4000 rpm, 5 minutes: Use pellet
-Cook in 2% SDS
-Spin off,4000 rpm, 5 min: Use pellet -Wash 10X with demi-water:
Resuspend
Spin off: Use pellet
Etc.
-Freeze pellet (For freeze drying: free it well)
-Freeze dry your pellet
Freeze the jar in which you will freeze dry your sample as well
Turn on the machine, it needs to get on temperature and suck vacuum
Make sure all the valves are closed  The big red valve needs to be open  The machine is ready when temperature reaches -80 and stays stable
Your greiner tube will be put in the jar with either a loose tube hood or parafilm to seal it off (prick 4 holes), seal the jar of with the rubber top
Place the jar on one of the valves and open it up slowly
When the sample is dry-freezed
Close the valve and remove the jar  Turn off the machine  Close the red valve
