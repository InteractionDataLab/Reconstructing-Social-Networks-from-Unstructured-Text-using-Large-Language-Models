Judging
Judging Form
Below you find the judging form as we filled it in via the iGEM site, but with some more links so it will be easy to see where the actual proof of this achievements can be found on our wiki
Team:
Groningen
Track:
New Application
Project Name:
Hydrophobofilm --- a self assembling hydrophobic biofilm
Project Abstract:
Surface hydrophobicity is a useful property and has many applications. Hydrophobicity keeps a surface clean and dry preventing micro-organisms from attaching to a surface. Most chemical  coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.
iGEM Medals
We believe our team deserves the following medal:
Bronze
Silver
Gold
Because we met the following criteria (check all that apply and provide     details where needed)
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team , have a great summer , and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2010 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
Enter this information and other documentation on both the iGEM 2010 wiki and the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K305011
iGEM Wiki Page Name: Expression
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_J04450 , BBa_E0240
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Link to this information on your wiki. Page name: Collaboration
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the: (check all that apply)
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or via the Internet
Please provide the BBF RFC number for your standard:
BBF RFC 52
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Link to this information on your wiki.
Page name: Human Practices
iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for prizes in their track, the grand prize, and for special prizes. The special prizes include Best Wiki, Best Poster, Best Presentation, Best New BioBrick Part (Natural or Engineered). To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance
Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these three special prizes:
Best Human Practices advance - We believe that it is very important to look further than the scientific part of our project. Therefore we focused on increasing general knowledge about synthetic biology and science overall amongst the general public. We presented our project at high schools and participated in events which were ment to reach out to the public.
Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts , please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Part Number(s): BBa_K305003 , BBa_K305007 , BBa_K305011
Your team has listed these parts as your team favorites.
iGEM Safety
For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
The iGEM judges expect that you have answered the four safety questions ( Safety page ) on your iGEM 2010 wiki.
Please provide the link to that page:
Page name: Safety
Attribution and Contributions
For iGEM 2010 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.
Please provide the link to that page:
Page name: Attribution and Contributions
Comments
If there is any other information about your project you would like to highlight for the judges,
please provide a link to your wiki page here: Education
