BioRad Micro Column Protein Prep Protocol
Day 1:  OVERNIGHTS
Pick a single colony from plate and inoculate 2mL TB/LB +Kan in a 14mL culture tube
Shake at 37deg 16-24hrs
Day 2: EXPRESSION
Inoculate a STERILE 250mL flask that contains 50mL of TB+Kan media with 1mL (or 500µL of overnight if you used TB) of the overnight.
Grow at 37 degrees until OD600 reaches 0.3-0.6 (generally 2-4 hrs)
Add IPTG for final concentration of 0.5mM.
Transfer to desired expression temperature and let express for the appropriate amount of time:
22C = 16-24hrs
30C = 8-12hrs
37C = 4-6hrs
Day 3: STORE
Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 20min in 50mL falcon tubes
Pour off supernatant
Store cells at -20C until ready for purification
Day 3/4: PURIFICATION
Lysis (~1hr) KEEP ON ICE OR IN COLD ROOM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
Add 500uL of wash buffer and vortex to resuspend cells
Add 1mL of lysis buffer and gently pippette up and down (minimizing bubbles)
Transfer to a 2mL Eppendorf tube.
Continue to incubate at room temp for 20min, mixing with plate mixer.
If worried about protein stability then incubate in the cold room for 1hr on rocker.
Save 50uL of lysis if want to run on gel.
Spin the lysis for 30-60min at 15000rpm
Spin longer if supernatant is not clear enough, but one hour should really be sufficient!
Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube (~1800uL) by decanting or careful pipetting
Purification KEEP ON ICE OR IN COLD ROOM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
Bind Protein  (~1/2hr)
Add 200uL of TALON/NiNTA Agarose 50% slurry to the column and place in 2mL centrifuge tube
Use a 1000uL tip otherwise the beads get stuck!
Final of 100uL of actual beads
Spin at 2000rpm for 2min
Discard flow-through and replace bottom cap
Add 500uL of supernatant, cap the top of the column, and mix (DO NOT VORTEX)
Let gently incubate on rocker for 5min
Remove caps and place in 2mL centrifuge tube
Spin 2000rpm for 2min
Discard flow-through and replace bottom cap
Repeat until all supernatant has passed through (~3-4x)
Washing Protein (~1/2hr)
Cap the bottom, add 500uL wash buffer, cap the top, mix, agitate 5min gently, remove caps and place in 2mL tube, spin 2000rpm 2min, discard flow-through
Cap the bottom, add 500uL wash buffer, cap the top, mix, agitate 5min gently, remove caps and place in 2mL tube, spin 2000rpm 2min, discard flow-through
Cap the bottom, add 500uL wash buffer, cap the top, mix, agitate 5min gently, remove caps and place in 2mL tube, spin 2000rpm 2min, discard flow-through
Eluting Protein (~1/4hr)
Cap the bottom, add 200uL of elution buffer, cap the top, mix, agitate 5min gently, remove caps and place in FRESH Eppendorf tube, spin 2000rpm 2min
THE FLOW-THROUGH IS YOUR PURIFIED PROTEIN!
