GFP EXPRESSION ASSAY
Day 1:  OVERNIGHTS
Prepare a 96 deep well plate with 1ml of LB + antibiotic
Inoculate well by taking at scraping from glycerol stock
Shake at 37deg 16-24hrs
Day 2: EXPRESSION
Prepare 96 deep well plate with 1ml of TB + antibiotic,
Inoculate well by taking 20ul of the overnight and place it in 1mL TB, do all inducible twice so to allow for induced verse uninducible expression
Grow on shaker at 37C for 3 hours
Induce all inducible constructs with 50microL of 10mM IPTG
Allow to grow for 18 hour at room temperature on a shaker
Day 3: DATA
Take overnights plates and spin on plate centrifuge for 20 minutes at 4000rpm
Pour of broth and resuspend in 1ml PBS 7.5 pH on plate shaker
Spin down PBS suspension for 20 minutes at 4000rpm
Pour of supernatant
Resuspend in 1ml PBS 7.5 pH on plate shaker
Take 100ul of PBS suspension and place into clear bottom plate reader plate
Take 100ul of PBS suspension and place into black plate reader plate
Read cell density by measuring absorbance at 600nm, and GFP fluorescence by exciting at 485 and reading emission at 525nm.
