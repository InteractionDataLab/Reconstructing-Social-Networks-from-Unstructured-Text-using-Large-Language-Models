Enzyme Assay
The general scheme of our fluorescence-based enzyme assay
After we have the CapD_CP mutants, we tested our mutants for their catalytic activity using our fluorescence-based enzyme assay scheme. Fluorescence-based enzyme assay measures the rate at which fluorescence in the testing media is released and the amount fluorescence depends on the rate at which fluorophore-quencher linkage is disrupted. Our substrate PDGA contains a linked fluorophore-quencher component. The faster fluorophore-quencher component is cleaved, the higher the amount of fluorescence is released and thus the greater the enzymatic activity observed.
Run one transpeptidase reaction and one hydrolysis reaction per enzyme (always run control for each set)
Prepare 10x Master Mix with these concentrations. (10uL/rxn)
HEPES 7.4 pH (250mM)
1% Tween
Substrate (500nM)
Dilute Enzymes
Measure enzyme concentrations by protein gel band intensity or with spectrophotometer (A280)
Dilute enzymes to 50nM (~0.0025mg/mL) in strip tubes
Make sure you have at least 30uL of your final diluted enzyme
Prepare a 96-well plate
Pipette diH2O into each well (Two per enzyme)
Transpeptidase: 70uL
Hydrolysis: 80uL
Pipette 10uL of 10x Master Mix into each well.
Pipette 10uL of 50mM L-Glu into each transpeptidation reaction well.
Prepare Spectramax plate reader with desired settings and desired emission and excitation wavelengths
Pipette 10uL of your enzyme into each well
Immediately place into Spectramax plate reader and begin reading
Final Concentrations
Enzyme (CapD) 5nM (0.00025mg/mL)
Amino Acid (L-Glutamate)0mM or 5mM
Substrate 50nM
