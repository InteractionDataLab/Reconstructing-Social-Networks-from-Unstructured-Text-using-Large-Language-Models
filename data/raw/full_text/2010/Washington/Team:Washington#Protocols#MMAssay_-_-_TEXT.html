Michaelis-Menten Assay
Prepare a 10x Master Mix with these concentrations (10uL/rxn)
Make one for each enzyme
HEPES 7.4 pH (250mM)
1% Tween
Purified Enzyme (50nM)
Dilute enzyme in 1x HEPES/Tween buffer
Note: Make one without enzyme for blank
Prepare Substrate
Prepare 10x substrate (10uM) in one well of a 12-well strip tube
Do half concentration serial dilutions (equal parts diH2O and substrate) until 11th well.
Leave the 12th well with no substrate
Final Concentrations of Substrate (Left to Right in uM):
10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, 0.078125, 0.0390625, 0.01953125, 0.009765625
1.1x Master Mix
Put equal parts 10x Master Mix and 10x L-Glu eppendorf tube (Referred to as L-Glu Master Mix)
Put equal parts 10x Master Mix and diH2O in an eppendorf tube (Referred to as diH2O Master Mix)
Fill each tube with diH2O (70uL/rxn)
Prepare a 96-well plate for transpeptidation
Pipette 90uL of 1.1x L-Glu Master Mix for one each enzyme across a row for the transpeptidation reaction
Repeat for each enzyme
Make one row of blank (1.1x L-Glu Master Mix without enzyme)
Prepare a 96-well plate for hydrolysis
Pipette 90uL of 1.1 diH2O Master Mix for each different enzyme in each new row
Repeat for each enzyme
Make one row of blank (1.1x diH2O Master Mix without enzyme)
Prepare Spectramax plate reader with desired settings
Pipette 10uL of Substrate into each well. (Column 1 from well 1 of strip tube, Column 2 from well 2 of strip tube, etc.)
Immediately place into Spectramax plate reader and begin reading
Final Concentrations
Enzyme (CapD) - 5nM (0.00025mg/mL)
Amino Acid (L-Glutamate) - 0mM or 5mM
Substrate - Variable Concentration
HEPES (7.4pH) - 25mM
0.1% Tween
Final Reaction Volume 100uL
Substrate is 5-FAM-(D-gamma-Glu)5-K(QXL520-NH2 from AnaSpec
Product produced from reaction is 5-FAM-(D-gamma-Glu)5-NH2 from AnaSpec
