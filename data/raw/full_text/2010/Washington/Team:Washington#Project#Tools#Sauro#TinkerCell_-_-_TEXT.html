TinkerCell is being developed by Deepak Chandran as part of his PhD work with the Sauro Lab . It's a synthetic biology CAD tool can be used to design and model genetic networks and other complex sets of reactions. Eventually, it will retrieve a list of available parts from sources like the Parts Registry , but for now generic parts must be added and their parameters specified manually.
The iGEM team is writing Python plugins to extend its functionality using the Plugin API .
