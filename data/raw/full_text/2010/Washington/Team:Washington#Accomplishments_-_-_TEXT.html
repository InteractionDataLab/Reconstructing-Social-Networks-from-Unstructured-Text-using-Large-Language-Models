Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device
We synthesized the CapD protein coding sequence optimized for E. Coli expression and in accordance with BioBrick standards, <partinfo>BBa_K314011</partinfo>, and determined its catalytic constants, as shown here: Find it on our wiki
We BioBricked the Tse2/Tsi2 <partinfo>BBa_K314203</partinfo>, toxin-antitoxin locus with F2620, an HSL inducible promoter, showed expression of the toxin in response to HSL, and presented evidence that both the toxin and antitoxin are working as expected. Find it on our wiki
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and document it in the registry
We re-engineered CapD into CapD_CP by circularly permuting it.  CapD_CP can be found in the parts registry under <partinfo>BBa_K314012</partinfo>.  As a result of this reengineering, CapD_CP no longer needs to autocleave itself to become active, resulting in substantially higher yields of active protein after purification.  We expressed and characterized the enzyme as can be found here: Find it on our wiki
We introduced and characterized a commonly used f1 phage replication origin, <partinfo>BBa_K314110</partinfo>.  By incorporating the f1 origin into current BioBrick plasmids new plasmids can replicate as double stranded DNA in bacteria or as single stranded DNA by M13 helper phage.  The part was characterized as shown here: Find it on our wiki
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry
We made a set of protein expression cassette's, allow future teams to make generators in a single round of cloning.  To do this we used some new parts (f1 ori, lacI, T7 Promoter)  as well as several existing parts (<partinfo>BBa_B0034</partinfo>, High Const# <partinfo>BBa_J23100</partinfo>, Low Const# <partinfo>BBa_J23114</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_R0011</partinfo>).  We then characterized each cassette's ability to express GFP (<partinfo>BBa_E0040</partinfo>).  Information and characterization of the cassette's in different base plasmids (<partinfo>pSB1C3</partinfo>, <partinfo>pSB1A3</partinfo>, <partinfo>pSB3K3</partinfo>, <partinfo>pSB4A5</partinfo>) can be found in our wiki here: Find it on our wiki
<partinfo>BBa_K314100</partinfo> High Constitutive expression cassette
<partinfo>BBa_K314101</partinfo> Low Constitutive expression cassette
<partinfo>BBa_K314103</partinfo> Lac Induced expression cassette
<partinfo>BBa_K314104</partinfo> T7 Induced expression cassette
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet
We developed a new standard, described in BBF RFC 68 , for the electronic distribution of diagrams based on SBOLv symbols.
We developed a new software tool, WikiDust , that allows users to quickly create standards-compliant diagrams and upload them to the iGEM wiki or other websites.
Gain real-world synthetic biology experience
Our team was comprised of senior high school students who had never pipetted before to graduating seniors with several years of lab experience.  By the end of the summer we had learned many skills in synthetic biology, from cloning genes, to developing enzyme assays, to writing code!
