Protein Expression/Purification of Recombinant Protein in pET29b+
Expression
1.Transform pET29b+ DNA into BL21(DE3)* competent cells, plate on KAN.
a.You can skip this step if there is already a glycerol stock in BL21(DE3)*
b.Combine 1uL of DNA + 20uL of cells in Falcon tube
i.Eppendorf is fine as well
c.Quickly immerse tube with cells in water batch at 42deg for 45sec
d.Remove and let rest on ice for 2min
e.Add 200uL of LB
f.Let recover, shaking at 37deg for 45min
g.Plate 200uL of cells onto a LB/Kan plate
2.Grow 50mL LB starter cultures in STERILE 250mL flask:
a.Thoroughly wash Flask with HOT WATER
i.Removes trace bleach/soap/etc which can inhibit cell growth
b.RINSE WITH diH2O (remove tap water particulates)
c.Autoclave for 20-40min
d.Cool down (1hr bench top should be enough)
e.50mL LB, 50uL 50mg/mL KAN
f.Innoculate with 1 colony or a scrape from glycerol stock
g.Grow O/N at 37C with shaking at 250 (let grow for >=18hrs).
h.Make glycerol stock using 500uL 50% glycerol + 500uL O/N culture.
i.This is only necessary if you do not already have a glycerol stock
3.Grow 0.5L cultures, in ZY Auto Induction media in 2L flask:
a.Thoroughly rinse out flask with HOT WATER
i.Removes trace bleach/soap/etc which can inhibit cell growth
b.RINSE WITH diH2O (remove tap water particulates)
c.5g Tryptone, 2.5g Yeast Extract + 465mL H2O.
i.Autoclave
ii.Let Cool down
iii.Make AUTOMIX (In separate 50ml falcon tube):
1.500uL 1M MgSO4
2.500uL 1000X Metals Mix
3.25mL 20X NPS
4.10mL 50X 5052
5.500uL 50mg/mL KAN
iv.Add contents of AUTMIX tube to Media
v.Add remaining 49.5mL of starter culture to media
vi.Grow at 18C for 24-30 hours.
4.Collect Cells
5.Spin at 4000rpm for 20 minutes.
6.Discard supernatant
7.Resuspend pellet in 5mL 1x PBS, pH 7.4
8.Transfer to 50mL falcon tubes.
a.Run gel to confirm expression. (optional)
Purification
1.Prepare buffers (recipes on next page)
a.Wash buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 500mM, 25mM Imidazole (pH 8)
b.Lysis Buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 500mM, 25mM Imidazole (pH 8), 2x Bug Buster, 2mg/mL lysozyme, 0.2mg/mL DNAse
c.Elution buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 500mM, 500mM Imidazole (pH 8)
d.Talon strip buffer: 100mM EDTA, pH 8.0
e.Talon recharge buffer: 100mM CoCL2
2.Lyse Cells (Sonication)
a.Sonication
i.Make master mix of lysis buffer and add 10mL to each pellet and resuspend.  Vortexing ok.
3.After each pellet is resuspended, pour resuspension into cleaned SS34 tube (holds 60mL roughly).
4.Add more lysis buffer so that its roughly 4/5 full
5.Remove Insoluble Matter
a.Balance samples in SS34 tubes (pairwise is sufficient)
b.Spin at >=18000rpm for >=30min at 4-15deg
i.If supernatent is still “goopy” add a little more DNAse and spin longer
6.Remove Particles
a.Filter supernatant with 0.4uM Filter into new 50mL falcon tube.
i.If analyzing expression save Supernatant & Pellet Gel Samples (50uL)
7.Run Proteins over Column
a.Equilibrate 1mL NiNTA-Superflow Gravity columns with 10mL wash buffer.
b.Run supernatant over column 2X
i.If analyzing expression Save Load FT.  Load FT Gel Sample
c.Wash column 1x with 20mL wash buffer with .5% Tween.
i.If analyzing expression Save Wash FT Gel Sample
d.Wash column 1x with 20mL wash buffer no Tween
e.Elute column with 15mL elution buffer
i.Collect in Vivaspin-20 Concentrator.
f.Save excess Elution buffer for blanking/diluting proteins later
8.Concentrate Proteins
a.Check A280 on using spec (e.g. nanodrop)
b.Spin at 8000 rpm for about 10-20min.
c.Target volume is 200uL
i.If this puts A280 above 30 stop at a larger volume, proteins can crash out when too concentrated.
7.Remove Excess Imidazole
a.Transfer 800uL to a dialysis tube (midi, 50-800uL), save the remaining protein
i.Novagen Cat No 71507-3
b.Let equilibrate in 1-4L of Dialysis buffer for at least 2 hours (overnight is fine)
c.Repeat so at least two rounds of dialysis have been done
8.Determine Protein Concentration
a.Check A280
b.Run Gel of Samples
i.Make 1:10 dilution of lysis, supernatent
ii.Dilute preconcentrated and final protein so A280 ~1.5
iii.Combine 5uL sample with 5uL 2x SDS Loading Buffer.
iv.Boil for 5min
v.Run 4-20% BioRad Gel for 35min at 200v
vi.Wash 3x with diH2O (rock 5min between each rinse)
vii.Stain using Thermo staining reagent
9.Store protein
a.For short term store in 4deg
b.For long term flash freeze and store at -80deg
10.Clean columns
a.10mL 5M GuHCl + 500mM Imidizole + 1% nonionic detergent (Tween-20)
b.10mL of ddiH2O
c.10mL of 0.2M EDTA (pH ~7.0)
d.10mL of ddiH2O
e.10mL of 50mM CoCl2
f.10mL of ddiH2O
g.10mL of 300mM NaCl
h.10mL of ddiH2O
i.10mL of 20% EtOH
j.Cap bottom, add 5mL of 20% EtOH, cap top and store
