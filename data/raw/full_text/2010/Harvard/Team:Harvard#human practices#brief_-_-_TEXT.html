Health Risks
There are many unknowns with regard to the risks we take when consuming genetically engineered plants. In plant engineering, constructs are inserted randomly into the genome, which creates the potential for unanticipated effects on plant metabolism. It is near impossible to predict the creation of new allergens or the side production on toxins in plants from the changes in plant metabolics.
The risks that apply to genetically engineered plants also apply to plants cross-bred in the conventional manner. In traditional plant cross-breeding, whole chromosomes are transferred and may recombine in a random manner (talk about incorporation of genetic material from different kinds of plants).
herbicide/pesticide use
Genetic Pollution
Genetically engineered plants have the potential to spread their genetic material to non-engineered strains and to native species, creating a threat to environmental security. It is difficult to track and recall if necessary genetic material that has already been released into the environment.
Genetically engineered plants are ususally less viable in the wild, and horizontal transfer is unlikely (why???)
Effects on Ecosystems
Butterflies + competition with native species (decrease in biodiversity
