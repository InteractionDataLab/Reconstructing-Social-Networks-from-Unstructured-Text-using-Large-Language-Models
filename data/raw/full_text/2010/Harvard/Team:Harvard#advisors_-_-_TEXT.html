I am a faculty member in the Systems Biology department at Harvard Medical School and have a joint appointment at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. Our lab develops technology towards the measurement of biological processes in living cells. That includes designing fluorescent proteins and the development of imaging and spectroscopic techniques. Together these permit dynamic quantification of protein localization, protein-protein interactions and protein activity while cells are carrying out a function of interest. For us the interesting processes are: cell division, cell motility and flow sensing. To read more see my research description on the HMS Systems Biology faculty page. I'm very excited to be advising the 2010 Harvard iGEM team.

pamela silver
I am a Professor in the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. I am also a member of the Harvard Medical School BBS Graduate Program and the Harvard Biophysics and Chemical Biology Graduate Programs. I am interested in lots of things ranging from Systems to Synthetic Biology, as are the members of my lab. I am also involved in a number of educational efforts including co-leading Harvard IGEM teams from 2007-present.
If you are interested in joining the group or requesting a reagent go to the Silver Lab homepage. I welcome applications from interested scientists at all levels (undergrad to postdoc) and from just about any background.

My research on the tumor suppressor hDlg includes an in-depth characterization of the combinations of hDlg isoforms present in multiple tissues and cell lines to correlate the presence of specific alternatively spliced insertions with a specific function of this tumor suppressor. Skin and keratinocytes are good model systems to study the role of hDlg in both cell proliferation and cell differentiation. For example, immunofluorescence assays reveal different patterns of isoform expression as well as changes in the intracellular distribution of various hDlg isoforms as cells establish junctions or undergo differentiation. I also study the perturbation of hDlg distribution in two skin disease: psoriasis, characterized by a hyper-proliferation of basal cells, and Darier+s disease, characterized by blisters resulting from the loss of cell adhesion in the supra-basal layers.
karmella haynes
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School in the lab of Pam Silver. I have been involved with iGEM since 2006. My experiences have been tons of fun and extremely exciting. iGEM and synthetic biology in general have inspired me to work toward starting my own lab (in the near future) devoted strictly to "engineering life."

tamara brenner
I work as the Assistant Director of Life Sciences Education at Harvard University, helping with various programs for undergraduate education in the life sciences. You can find me in the Biolab, room 1087, tamara_brenner@harvard.edu
I did my doctoral work in Christine Guthrie's lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where I studied pre-mRNA splicing in budding yeast.
