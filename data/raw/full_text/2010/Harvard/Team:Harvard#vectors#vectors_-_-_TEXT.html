meet the vectors
Our vectors are a modification of the pORE agrobacterium vector system developed by Coutu, ''et al'', at Agriculture and Agrofood Canada, which we obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) . This vector system is designed for agrobacterium mediated plant transformation, and is a binary system with the vector containing the site for foreign constructs and the appropriate flanking regions to be recognized for introduction to the plant. The virulence genes are present on a separate vector contained in the agrobacteria, separate from the TDNA.
To modify the pORE series binary vectors to fit the BioBrick standard, we used a combination of PCR mutagenesis and digestion strategies to replace the vectors' existing multiple cloning site with the BioBrick multiple cloning site. We worked with two of each of the open, reporter, and expression series vectors, creating a total of six BioBrick vectors suitable for agrobacterium mediated plant transformation.

The open series vectors are designed for general insertion of a construct. We modified the vectors pORE O1 and pORE O2. pORE O1 confers plant resistance to glufosinate , and pORE O2 confers plant resistance to kanamycin , to be used in transformant selection.

The reporter series vectors contain a reporter on the trailing end of the multiple cloning site such that expression of the reporter follows that of the inserted construct. We modified the vectors pORE R1 and pORE R3. pORE R1 contains the gusA reporter, and pORE R3 the smgfp reporter. Both vectors confer plant resistance to kanamycin.

The expression series vectors contain a promoter preceding the multiple cloning site such that the inserted construct can be easily expressed through activation of the contained promoter. We modified the vectors pORE E3 and pORE E4. Both vectors contain the ENTCUP2 promoter. pORE E3 confers plant resistance to glufosinate, and pORE E4 confers plant resistance to kanamycin
