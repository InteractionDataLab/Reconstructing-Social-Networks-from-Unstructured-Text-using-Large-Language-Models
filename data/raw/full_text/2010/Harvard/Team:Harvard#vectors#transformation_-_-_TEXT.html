engineering plant transformation
One of the key characteristics of the mechanism by which agrobacteria transform plants is that all material between the right and left borders of the T-DNA region is incorporated as a unit into the plant genome, allowing us to take advantage of the mechanism by replacing the agrobacteria T-DNA with our own constructs. The original genes in the T-DNA region were those that coded for tumor formation, and we can remove those genes without negatively impacting agrobacteria's ability to infect and transform plants. By replacing the tumor forming genes in the T-DNA regions with genes that we want to express in plants, we can
