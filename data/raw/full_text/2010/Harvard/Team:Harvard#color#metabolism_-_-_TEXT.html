pigment metabolism
In pigment metabolism, a series of enzymes catalyze the transform of one metabolite to the next, forming a pathway. Metabolic pathways are often very complex, containing many branch points, loops, and interactions between separate pathways. Below is a map of carotenoid metabolism. The enzymes in green are those found in Arabidopsis.
