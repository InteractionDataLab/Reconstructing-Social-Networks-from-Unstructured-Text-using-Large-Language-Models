Started preparation of agrobacterium vector backbones
Digested O1, O2, E3, E4, R1, R3 with HindIII and SpeI (Fast Digest Protocol - make link)
Ran digests on 1% agarose gel (protocol link)
Digest successful for O1, O2, and R1 but not for E3, E4, and R3 (reason unknown)

[click to enlarge]
Cut out backbone (top) bands for E3, E4, R3 from the gel
Realized that ordered O1, O2 oligos had SacII sticky and rather than HindIII

Ran digests on 1% agarose gel (protocol link)
Digest successful for both reactions
[click to enlarge]
Cut out backbone bands for both reactions
Annealed open series insert oligos (synthesized by Mr. Gene) (protocol link - karmella's)
Gel purified bands for all reactions (protocol link)
Realized that backbones needed to be dephosphorylated before ligation, so redid digestions with phosphatase.
Digested O1, O2 with SacII and SpeI, with TSAP (phosphatase) added (slow digest protocol, buffer 4, 30 ul reactions). Did two digest reactions for each vector to increase yields.
Digested E3, E4, R1, R3 with HindIII and SpeI, with TSAP added (fast digest protocol, 30 ul reactions). Did two digest reactions for each vector to increase yields.
Ran digests on 1% agarose gel (protocol link)
Digest successful for all reactions

Cut out backbone (top) bands for each reaction, keeping the two digests of each vector in the same eppendorf tube.
06-16-2010 [ top ]
Completed preparation of agrobacterium vector backbones and prepared expression series and reporter series inserts
Gel purified digest slices from previous day (protocol link)
Ran a PCR reaction on E3, E4, R1, R3 vectors with primers synthesized by Mr. Gene (PCR phusion protocol) to generate inserts

Transformed 5 ul of reaction mix into 15 ul of cells
Plated onto LB + Kan plates, left at 30°C overnight
06-18-2010 [ top ]
Realized that there was a 1bp error in annealed oligos for O1 and O2 (had sticky end for SpeI site instead of NheI site)
Ordered new oligos with corrected bp
Started to obtain E3, E4, R1 and R3 plasmids from E. coli
Prepared 50 ug/ml LB+Kan Media.
Picked four colonies of E. coli from the E3, E4, R1 and R3 plates and made a culture from each in LB and Kanamycin
Left cultures at 37°C for 6 hours
Centrifuged cultures to produce pellet and removed the liquid
Stored pellet at -20°C
06-21-2010 [ top ]
Carried out initial test to verify the identity of plasmid transformed into E. coli
Carried out miniprep to obtain plasmids from cells (protocol link)
Digested plasmids with EcoI and HindIII (protocol link)
Ran digests on 1% agarose gel (protocol link)
[click to enlarge]
Ladder was unclear so needed to repeat
Measured concentration of miniprep product
Concentrations were low (<44ng/uL) so needed to redo miniprep
Picked new colonies (2 from each plate) and grew cultures overnight
06-22-2010 [ top ]
Continued to carry out initial test to verify the identity of plasmid transformed into E. coli
Carried out miniprep to obtain plasmids from cells (protocol link)
Digested plasmids with EcoI and HindIII (protocol link)
Ran digests on 1% agarose gel (protocol link)
[click to enlarge]
Larger bands were observed, suggesting the correct backbones were present
Smaller bands were observed, suggesting the correct inserts were present
Started to prepare for plasmids to be sequenced
Required more plasmids
Transformed plasmids back into E. coli using heat shock (carried out twice for each of V9-12) (see protocol)
Added Kanamycin to LB plates
Spread E. coli cells onto LB + Kanamycin plates
Left plates in 37°C overnight
06-23-2010 [ top ]
Continued to prepare for plasmids to be sequenced
Picked 3 colonies from each of the V9, V10 and V12 plates and 4 colonies from each of the V11 plates
Left at 37°C for 6 hours
After 6 hours, had not grown enough, so left cultures overnight at 37ºC
06-24-2010 [ top ]
Miniprepped V9-V12 cultures. Got yields with enough DNA to send to GeneWiz for sequencing. Primers arrived from Mr. Gene and we will send constructs off for sequencing next week.
Started putting together Open Series constructs
Annealed oligos synthesized by Mr. Gene to form insert (protocol)
Ligated with backbone digested last week
Transformed into TURBO E. Coli and plated onto LB + Kan
06-25-2010 [ top ]
Continued preparation of Open Series constructs
Picked colonies from both V7 (O1) and V8 (O2) and set up cultures. Only cultures for V7 grew. Because of the patterns of colonies on the plates, we suspect that the Kanamycin was not properly spread on the plates.
We had used up all of our remaining digested backbone for O2, so we redid the SacII/SpeI digestion on both vectors with phosphatase, re-ligated, and re-transformed and plated, using a negative control
06-28-2010 [ top ]
Completed preparation of Open Series construct
Colonies grew for V8 (O2) only. Set up cultures for colonies.
Miniprepped cultures of both constructs
Prepared vectors for sequencing
Resuspended primers in water
Mixed required quantities and concentrations of each vector and primer in PCR tubes
Sent tubes to GeneWiz for sequencing
06-30-2010 [ top ]
Got back sequencing results (link to sequences)
Confirmed V9, V10, V11, V12 - both #5,6 for all. V11 had a single base pair change in the middle of the GusA sequence (bp 6315, T instead of C). This basepair is at the end of a codon, and the change does not change the translation of the sequence.
V7, V8 had faulty primers - the reverse was not the reverse compliment and the forward was too close to the sequence, so redesigned primers and ordered them.
07-01-2010 [ top ]
Started to produce more of the V9-V12 vectors
Set up starter cultures for V9-V12 for maxipreps from colonies from the #5 plate of each construct (in LB+Kan 50ug/ml)
Poured started cultures in 150mL LB + Kan (50ug/ml)
Tested transformation into agrobacterium
Agrobacterium transformation (electroporation)
Transformed E4 and V10, plus did a control that was shocked without DNA, and a control that was not shocked but had E4 in it.
Plated on LB+Kan(50ug/ml) + Gent(30ug/ml) + Rif(10ug/ml)
07-02-2010 [ top ]
Carried out maxipreps of V9-V12
Created glycerol stocks of V9-V12
07-06-2010 [ top ]
Agrobacterium plates had colonies for E4 and V10 and no growth for the negative controls
Sequencing V7 and V8 showed they were correct (see sequences)
Started cultures for maxiprep of V7 and V8
07-07-2010 [ top ]
Carried out maxipreps of V7 and V8
07-12-2010 [ top ]
Started putting finished constructs from other teams into vectors
Digested V9, V10, Miraculin, Brazzein, Miraculin + YFP, Brazzein + YFP with EcoRI and PstI (V9/V10 with TSAP added as well)
[click to enlarge]
Digested parts appear to be the correct size
Gel extraction led to low yields, so redid digestions the next day
07-13-2010 [ top ]
Continued putting finished constructs into vectors
Digested V9, V10, Miraculin, Brazzein, Miraculin + YFP, Brazzein + YFP, GFP Knockdown 1, GFP Knockdown 3 with EcoRI and PstI (V9/V10 with TSAP added as well)
[click to enlarge]
Digested parts appear to be the correct size
Ligated vectors (V9/V10) and inserts to form V21-V32 (see parts page) and transformed into TURBO E. coli
07-14-2010 [ top ]
Colonies from 7-13-10 transformation were very large and unevenly spread
Picked two colonies from each ligation and started cultures
07-15-2010 [ top ]
Miniprepped cultures for V21-V32 (set up 7-14-10)
Transformed into Agrobacteria
Settings: Agr Setting on electroporator
Amounts: 40 ul electrocompetent cells, 5.5 ul DNA (~100 ng/ul)
Transformed: V21-V32 #2, V10 as positive control, blank cells as negative control
Plated transforms onto LB + Kan + Rif + Gent plates
07-16-2010 [ top ]

[click to enlarge]
All constructs had inserts of the correct size, except V23-2
07-19-2010 [ top ]
Set up lawn plates on YEB + Kan + Gent + Rif
V21-V32 except V23, V10, E4 (from prior transform)
Resuspended each individual colony in 30 ul water, plated 25 ul of resuspension (5 ul kept for sequencing)
07-22-2010 [ top ]
Removed lawn plates from incubator in the morning
E4 did not grow as much, so left it in the incubator (the colony picked to make the plate was older than the others)
