abstract lab notebook pigment metabolism engineering pathways targeting the petals parts & primers results references
engineering metabolic pathways
Our goal is to accumulate the pigments lycopene and beta-carotene in the petals of Arabidopsis, and we plan to do so by inhibiting the enzymes lycopene epsilon cyclase (LUT2), carotene beta-ring hydroxylase (BETA-OHASE 1), and lycopene beta cyclase (LYC) via artificial microRNA interference . Ordinarily, these pigments are intermediates in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, and we hope that by interfering with the pathway, we can cause an abnormal accumulation of these intermediates and thus produce color.
scheme #1
scheme #2
scheme #3
scheme #4
In our first scheme, we will knock out LUT2 on its own. We hope that this will induce accumulation of lycopene.
In our second scheme, we will knock out BETA-OHASE 1 on its own. We hope that this will induce accumulation of beta-carotene.
In our third scheme, we will knock out both LUT2 and BETA-OHASE1. We hope that this will induce accumulation of some lycopene and some beta-carotene.
In our fourth scheme, we will knock out both LUT2 and LYC. We hope that this will induce accumulation of lycopene.
