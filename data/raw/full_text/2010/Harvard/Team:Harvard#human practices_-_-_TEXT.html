human practices background our vision the iGarden kit virtual iGarden opinion poll recycling references
overview
There is huge controversy surrounding the use of genetic engineering in agriculture, even as new approaches promise better, safer food with a smaller input of energy and harmful agricultural chemicals. As our project deals with using synthetic biology for personalized and open source genetic engineering of plants, our project is intimately linked to concerns about genetically engineered foods on both sides. Here we will take some time to explore this controversy, ask members of our community about their thoughts, educate people about how genetic engineering in plants is done, and present our vision for how the iGarden kit will fit into people's homes and gardens.
