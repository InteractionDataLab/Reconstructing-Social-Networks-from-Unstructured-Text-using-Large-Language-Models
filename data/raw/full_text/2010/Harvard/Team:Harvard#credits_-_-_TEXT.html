To our Wonderful TFs
Christina, Devin, Mara, Oliver, and Patrick,
We hope you realize how thankful we all are for everything you have done to make this experience wonderful for all of us. Working on the iGarden with all of you has been a fantastic experience, and we are so grateful for all you taught us, all the hours and hours of work you put into helping us with the project, and all the fun we had with you from the first meeting in the spring through to the Jamboree.
Thank you so much for everything.
-undergrads
many thanks!
Our project could not have been possible without the help and support of many people. First and foremost, Kurt Schellenberg and Sarah Mathews for help with everything related to growing and transforming Arabidopsis - thank you for your tireless support as we learned how to care for and engineer plants. Kirsten Bomblies and Detlef Weigel for providing us with information and constructs for construction of artificial microRNAs, CSIRO for providing us with hairpin RNAi vectors for plants, Tim Hsiau and J. Chris Anderson for providing help and materials for the genetic fence, and TAIR, for the pORE vector series.
