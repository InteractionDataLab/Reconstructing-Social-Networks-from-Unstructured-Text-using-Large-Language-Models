Jugaad vs. Hack
"Jugaad(a hindi term) is a survival tactic, whereas a hack is an intellectual art form; i.e. Jugaad is the wile of the poor, and hack the pastime of the affluent cerebral. Jugaad is a hack to get around or deal with a lack of or limited resources, and has a class component to it - jugaad are things poor but clever people do to make the most of the resources they have. They do what they need to do, without regard to what is supposed to be possible." - wikipedia
During the summer, we decided to question the idea that synthetic biology or biology for that matter could be done only with high-end scientific equipment. We began to construct lab instruments out of cheap, readily available material. We have realized that the barriers for doing science need not be so high.
We've so far built a sterile hood, a centrifuge, a gel-electrophoris box, a water bath, an incubator, microscopes and also a touch-table lab assistant. All instructions to build these instruments are open source and can be downloaded in detail from here
