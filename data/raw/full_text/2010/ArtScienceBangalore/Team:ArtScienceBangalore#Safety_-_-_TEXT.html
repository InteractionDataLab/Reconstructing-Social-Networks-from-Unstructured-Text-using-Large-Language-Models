Safety
1. None of our ideas raised safety issues inside or outside the laboratory.
2. The Bench work was done inside the National Center for Biological Sciences(Bangalore) premises and strictly followed the safety protocols and guidelines set by the safety review board at NCBS.
3. The National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore has well equipped labs where bio safety is properly taken care of. Current facilities at the labs full fill the requirements of bio safety level-1 as mentioned in Bio Safety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (4th edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington: 1999).
