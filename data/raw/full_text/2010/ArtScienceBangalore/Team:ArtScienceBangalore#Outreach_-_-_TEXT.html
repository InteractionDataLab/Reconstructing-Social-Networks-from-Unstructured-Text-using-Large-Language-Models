Outreach
We believe that human practice and outreach has more to it than filling out surveys and analyzing excel spreadsheets. We spent our time during IGEM trying to reach out locally to as many people as possible in the form of workshops, performances, handbooks, murals and graffiti.
Workshops.
DIY microscopy workshops for school children
DNA extraction parties
Comic Book
Get our C.Elegans + E.Coli comic book at the Jamboree!!
Showing off our DIY LAB
Murals/Graffiti around Bangalore
Manuals and Handbooks
Our famous "Synthetic Biology for Artists and Designers Handbook"
The handbook is being reworked and a new updated copy should be available. Get your hands on one at the Jamboree!!!
IGEA- The International Genetically Engineered Art Competition
iGEM began in January of 2003 with a month-long course during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP).We hope our International Genetically Engineered Art Competition will  spur artists and designers to engage with the same intensity as engineers. The first IGEA was held at Srishti and was organized by our advisors James, Daisy and Yashas.
