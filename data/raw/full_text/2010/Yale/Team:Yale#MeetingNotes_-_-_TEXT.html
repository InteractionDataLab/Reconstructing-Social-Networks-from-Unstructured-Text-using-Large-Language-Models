The phsABC plasmid worked!  We have metal precipitation!  Woooo!
1. Cloning issues
Did the double digestion of the terminator work?
The EcoRI was old and might have failed, check each enzyme on a gel
SpeI not very efficient in EcoRI buffer, will try to incubate longer
The ligation didn't work, but there are lots of ways to keep trying.  This is a great way for people to come help during the week.
2. Copper precipitation assay
Pick a concentration from the cell growth assay, like 1 mM Cu?
Grow shaking, at time points spin out the cells and measure the absorbance
this is assaying for loss of copper
3. Does phsABC confer copper resistance?
96-well plate assay
same as before, but with the phsABC plasmid
Since Leah has this assay dialed-in, this is a great job for a part-time helper to run and analyze!
4.  Cu resistance
will be shipping in a day or two
pRJ1004 (Cu efflux protein) (Jon will email to follow up)
massive plasmid, no antibiotic resistance
Get together next week to request several plasmids (Tuesday morning at 10 am).
5. Email Kara about the mold (Jon)
6. Ways to get students involved (Dan email the group)
Ask when they're available, delegate a task
make sure someone is there to help them
