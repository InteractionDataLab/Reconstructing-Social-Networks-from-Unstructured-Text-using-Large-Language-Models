Copper-Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid standard absorbance curve measurement
1. Make serial 10-1 dilutions of 1mM to 10pM CuSO4 in LB media.
2. Make 100mM solution of  Bathocuproinedisulfonic (BCS) reagent.
3. Measure absorbance (483nm) of LB media without copper as blank.
4. Add 1µL of 1M ascorbate and and 1µL of BCS to 100µL of standard copper solution.
5. Measure absorbance of each copper solution at (483nm)
6. Record results.
