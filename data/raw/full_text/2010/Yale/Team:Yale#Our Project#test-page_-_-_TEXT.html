1. We start with a file obtained from NAMD:
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/utilities/ and download namdstats.tcl
2. In the VMD TkCon window, type :
     source namdstats.tcl
     data avg ../namd_log 101 last
The second line will call a procedure which will calculate the average for all output variables in the log ﬁle from the ﬁrst logged timestep after 101 to the end of the simulation.
