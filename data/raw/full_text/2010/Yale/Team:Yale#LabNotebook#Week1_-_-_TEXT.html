From 2010.igem.org
Monday 6/7--defended project (yay!)
Wednesday 6/9--started in lab--got set up & started cultures of DH5alpha and LE392
Thursday 6/10--inoculated liquid cultures in AM, made up different copper sulfate & LB solutions, then ran first copper growth assay in plate reader in PM w/three different ODs of each strain(4 hr. protocol)
Friday 6/11--Ran another growth assay with middling concentrations based on results of first, but bacteria failed to grow well--b/c allowed to overgrow?
Monday 6/14--Primer design, redo of Friday's growth assay
Tuesday 6/15--more primer design & plasmid synthesis planning (see posted plan on google group), spotted cell soln's from Monday growth assay to see if bacteria survived
Wednesday 6/16--checked on spotted cell survival assay, collected MOPS minimal media materials, started making component solutions
Thursday 6/17--more minimal media work and meeting, started BL21 culture
Friday 6/18--plasmid pSB74 should arrive! Make chemically competent versions of all cell lines. Transform all cell lines with pSB74. Also transform promoter and terminator (taken from kit).  Make up plates with antibiotics. Help would be welcome :)
Saturday 6/19--take plates w/ transformed cells out of incubator & leave in cold room
Sunday 6/20--in evening inoculate 5 mL liquid cultures
