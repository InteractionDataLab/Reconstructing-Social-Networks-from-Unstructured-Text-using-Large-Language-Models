Monday 6/14--Primer design, redo of Friday's growth assay
Tuesday 6/15--more primer design & plasmid synthesis planning (see posted plan on google group), spotted cell soln's from Monday growth assay to see if bacteria survived
Wednesday 6/16--checked on spotted cell survival assay, collected MOPS minimal media materials, started making component solutions
Thursday 6/17--more minimal media work and meeting, started BL21 culture
Friday 6/18--plasmid pSB74 arrived (!), already in some unspecified E coli, so plated them out. Transformed promoters (constitutive & IPTG inducible), terminator, and repressor (for inducible promoter) into BL21. Also ran BL21 copper growth assays for wide and narrow concentrations ranges.
June the 19th--in which it is revealed that there was a transformation-fail
Redid transformation, this time into LE392, set aside pSB74 containing cells in fridge
Sunday 6/20--in evening inoculate 5 mL liquid cultures
