about us
Yale's team is composed of seniors, juniors, and sophomores enrolled in Yale College that share a passion for science, staying-up late in the lab, and, of course, bacteria!  Our team also has also had the pleasure of learning from many advisors in Yale Graduate Studies for Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology. Our team has worked consistently since Winter 2009 brainstorming innovative ideas and implementing them throughout the summer wetlab work.
Our undergraduate members include: Jon Russell, Leah Itagaki, Warren Floyd, Kara Brower, Sherwin Yu, Chidi Akusobi, Nabeem Hashem, Jane Long, Nayeon Kim, Usman Anwer, Darren Zhu, Alexander Li, and Kevin Shen.
Our excellent graduate advisors include: Kaury Kucera, Dan Spakowicz, Brian Dunican, Jeff Shaw, and Adam Trexler.
We also are extremely grateful for the help of our faculty advisors- Liz Rhoades and Nigel Grindley.In addition, we are exceedingly appreciative of the funding and support from the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute, the Rothberg Institute, and the Yale College Dean's Office for their extensive support and guidance - without them, none of this would be possible.
