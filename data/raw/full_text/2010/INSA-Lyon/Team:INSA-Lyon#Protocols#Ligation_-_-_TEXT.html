Ligation
If it follows a digestion without purification: 20 minutes of thermoinactivation at 70°C
Add x µL DNA (the entire digestion gel purification for part ligation) Plasmid: 50 to 200 ng; Insert: 100 ng (0,5 kb) to 1 µg (10 kb))
Add 2 µL Buffer T4 DNA ligase (Attention: this buffer contains ATP, defrost on ice)
Add 0,5 µL T4 DNA ligase (0,5 U) --> Add the enzyme last
Add sterile water qs 20 µL
Incubate 3h or overnight at room temperature or at 15°C
