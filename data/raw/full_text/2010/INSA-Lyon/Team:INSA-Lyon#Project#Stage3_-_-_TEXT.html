Stage 3 : Evolution
Evolution has been naturally performing synthetic biology for the last thousands years without our knowledge. Evolution combined with mutation and environmental changes has designed and constructed new biological functions and systems not found so far in nature.
This project aims to study how this happened in nature and to use this knowledge to engineer a more complex structure into a chassis that did not possess it.
We were particularly interested in studying how discrete monofuntional enzymes got organised into one single multifunctional enzyme through evolution. Projects 1 and 2 are indeed dealing with the polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) ABC operon gene which codes for 3 distinct enzymes. It would be the final goal of our global project to increase this lipid production by designing one optimized mutlifunctional enzyme.
