Overview of the project
Polyhydroxyalcanoates (PHAs) are universal prokaryotic storage compounds of carbon and energy. They are accumulated into the cell as spherical inclusion bodies in case of oversupply of carbon sources. We aim to control the production and the composition of granules in E.Coli. Many industrial and biomedical applications for those granules had been evocated. We want to concentrate especially on two axes :
⋅ the granule as nano or micro-beads in order to purify a molecule of interest
⋅ the granule as a storage system for overproduced lipids of interest such as DHA or EPA.
