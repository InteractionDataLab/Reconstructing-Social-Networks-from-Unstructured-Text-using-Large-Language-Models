Biofilms quantification
Precultures of PHL818 and MG1655 in M63 medium + 0,2g/L glucose
Dilute the cultures in order to have an absorbance (600nm) of 0,02, into a 24-well hydrophobic polystyrene plate, in (M63 + glucose)/2 medium, with sucrose concentrations varying between 0 and 0,3mol/L
Incubate at 30°C, during 48h
Pull out the 2ml supernatants and rinse one time with 1ml of M63 medium.
Resuspend the adherent bacteria with 1ml of M63 medium.
Measure the biomass in 3ml supernatants and also in 1ml biofilm (absorbance at 600nm). Calculate the percentage of bacteria in biofilms, which represents the adherence percentage.
