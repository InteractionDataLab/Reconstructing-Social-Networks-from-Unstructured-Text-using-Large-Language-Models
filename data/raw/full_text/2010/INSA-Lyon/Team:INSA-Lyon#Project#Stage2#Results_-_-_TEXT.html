Observation of the phasin-intein fusion protein (BBa_K342002) on the granule
Our ligation didn't work out so we couldn't realize the observations as planned.
We had many difficulties to add the constitutive promoter despite numerous tries.
Lipidic inclusion in the PHB drop
We made a double transformation with pILI1 and 20N: The resultant bacteria synthesize the PHB drops and over synthesize the licopen.
When we obtained the clones, we started four different series of cultures in order to analyze the will of the lipid when the granule are produced.
Serie 1 : in  LB media with glucose 7% and 2,5µg of  RedNile
pILI1 with ampiciline
double transformation with ampicillin
double transformation with ampicillin and kanamycin
The lipid part with kanamycin
Serie 2 : in  LB media with 2,5µg of RedNile
pILI1 with ampicillin
double transformation with ampicillin
double transformation with ampicillin and kanamycin
The lipid part with kanamycin
Serie 3 : in  LB media with glucose 7%
pILI1 with ampicillin
double transformation with ampicillin and kanamycin
The lipid part with kanamycin
Serie 4 : in LB media, the double transformation with ampicillin and kanamycin
We observed a sample of each culture under fluorescence microscope. Unfortunately we couldn't see the difference between the granules and the licopen.
