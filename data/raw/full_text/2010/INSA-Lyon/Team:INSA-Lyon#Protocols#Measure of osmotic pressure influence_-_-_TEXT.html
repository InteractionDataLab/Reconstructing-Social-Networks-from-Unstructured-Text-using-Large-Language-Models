Measure of osmotic pressure influence
Preparation of different media : 0M - 0,01M - 0,05M - 0,1M – 0,5M
x (µL)  Sucrose 1M
2,5mL media M63
50µL of glucose
Complet with steril water until 5mL
Incubate during 24 h at the temperature 28°C and the shaking speed of 100rpm
Measure of the fluorescence : input wavelenght 490 nm, output one 510 nm.
Measure of the biomass(absorbance 600 nm): Dilute 250 µL of culture in 750 µL of water.
Make the blank with 0,5mL of media M63 and 0,5mL of steril water
