Protocols
Choose a protocol to read its description :
Competent cells
Transformation
DNA extraction
Digestion
Ligation
Measure of temperature and shaking speed influence
Measure of osmotic pressure influence
Granules extraction and intein cleavage
Biofilms quantification
Extra
Measure of temperature and shaking speed influence
Introduce 5 mL of half LB in a sterile tube
Resuspend bacteria in 0,5 mL of sterile water. Vortex
Add 10 µL of the mixture in the LB tube. Vortex
Incubate 24 h in a waterbath at the temperature and the shaking speed wished
Measure of the fluorescence : input wavelenght 490 nm, output one 510 nm.
Dilute 250 µL of culture in 750 µL of water. Measure the biomass (absorbance 600 nm)
