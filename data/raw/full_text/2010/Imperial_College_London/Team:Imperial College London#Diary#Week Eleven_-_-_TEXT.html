Diary Week
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
We embarked on our iGEM project in early July, after finishing our exams and having about a week off for a bit of rest and relaxation. There have been highs, there have been lows, but it's all part of the amazing journey that is iGEM! We really hope you enjoy reading our diary, but if you're a bit short of time we recommend the video diary for a slightly more entertaining experience!
Week Eleven
After a lovely cycle ride through Hyde Park, Harriet and Florian went to St Mary’s Campus for a meeting on the technicalities of using a parasite detection kit in the field. They met Professor Alan Fenwick, director of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) and Dr Wendy Harrison, Deputy Director of the SCI.
The Surface Protein Team finally had some good news this week; pVEG and the LytC CWBD were successfully ligated and transformed into E. coli.
On Wedneday night, Kyasha threw an awesome party. Both Wolf and Piotr sang for us and some of the guys ended up showing off how many push ups they could do. Unfortunately, the girls didn't seem that impressed.
