Human Practices
Overview | Panel | Workshop | Meetings | Report | Documentary
Human practices has been a hugely important influence in the design of our final product. We contacted a number of experts very early on in the design process to allow us to truly adapt our specifications to meet the requirements of a field testing kit for parasites. This has ensured that our design is as feasible and useful as possible.
Documentary
During the iGEM project, we were filmed by Kelly Neaves and Dominic Rees-Roberts for a documentary about synthetic biology and the iGEM Competiton. Having already completed PhDs in the biological sciences, Kelly and Dom were on the MSc course in Science Media Production at Imperial. Like us, they were funded by the Wellcome Trust.
The aim of the documentary was to present synthetic biology in an engaging way to the wider public. Throughout the course of the project, we each had individual interviews where we were asked to explain what synthetic biology meant to us. This was actually a really important exercise for us as it allowed us to gain a different perspective of the project and practise explaining the concept to non-specialists, which was to come in handy in the school workshops!
