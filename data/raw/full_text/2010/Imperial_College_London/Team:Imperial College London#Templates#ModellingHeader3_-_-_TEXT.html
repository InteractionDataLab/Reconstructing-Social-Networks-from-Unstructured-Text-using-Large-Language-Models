From 2010.igem.org
Modelling had a big influence on the design of our system. A major part of the project consisted of modelling each module. This enabled us to decide which ideas we should implement in the labs and which ones we should not consider further. With the help of our models, we were able to make crucial decisions regarding the design of our system. Look at the Fast Response page for a great example of how modelling has made a major impact on the design.
