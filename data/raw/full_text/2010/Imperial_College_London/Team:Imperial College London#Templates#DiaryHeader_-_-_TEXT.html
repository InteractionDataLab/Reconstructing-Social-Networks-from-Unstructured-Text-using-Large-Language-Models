Diary Week
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
We embarked on our iGEM project in early July, after finishing our exams and having about a week off for a bit of rest and relaxation. There have been highs, there have been lows, but it's all part of the amazing journey that is iGEM! We really hope you enjoy reading our diary, but if you're a bit short of time we recommend the video diary for a slightly more entertaining experience!
