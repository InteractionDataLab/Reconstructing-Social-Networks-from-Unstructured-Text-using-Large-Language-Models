Modelling
Overview | Detection Model | Signaling Model | Fast Response Model | Interactions
A major part of the project consisted of modelling each module. This enabled us to decide which ideas we should implement. Look at the Fast Response page for a great example of how modelling has made a major impact on our design!

Objectives
The motivation to develop this model came from our design process. The idea of having surface proteins that could be cleaved and would then activate the receptor was very innovatory. However, with this new approach a few questions arose that could not be answered without using computer models. Hence, the following aims for this model were specified:
Determine the concentration of Schistosoma elastase or TEV protease that should be added to the bacteria in order to trigger a response.
Attempt simulating how long it takes for the protease or elastase to cleave enough peptides and, hence, trigger the response.
Assess the risk of false positives (i.e. system is activated without the required stimulus).
The pink shadow indicates which part of the whole system the detection model is simulating. It includes TEV or Schistosoma protease cleaving the surface protein to activate the receptor.
