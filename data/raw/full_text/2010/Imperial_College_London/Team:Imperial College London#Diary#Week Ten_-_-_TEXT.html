Diary Week
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
We embarked on our iGEM project in early July, after finishing our exams and having about a week off for a bit of rest and relaxation. There have been highs, there have been lows, but it's all part of the amazing journey that is iGEM! We really hope you enjoy reading our diary, but if you're a bit short of time we recommend the video diary for a slightly more entertaining experience!
Week Ten
The XylE team transformed E. coli with ligated pSB1C3-pVEG-RBS.
The Surface Protein Team continued to work with pVEG and the LytC CWBD.
On Friday we had a meeting with our advisors to show them the results from the catechol assays.
Wolf bought Krispy Kremes for Cake Friday! Then we all went to Eastside with some of the advisors for the last bit of filming that we’d have to do!t
Kelly and Dom took some pictures of just the Team and then some of us with Dr Tom Ellis (one of our advisors) and Chris (our supervisor). Here's one of us all together:
