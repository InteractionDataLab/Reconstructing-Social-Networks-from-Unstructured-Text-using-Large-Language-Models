Modelling
Overview | Detection Model | Signaling Model | Fast Response Model | Interactions
A major part of the project consisted of modelling each module. This enabled us to decide which ideas we should implement. Look at the Fast Response page for a great example of how modelling has made a major impact on our design!

Detailed Description
We are assuming steady-state for AIP, Phosphate, ComD and ComE in our cell/in the solution. Hence, we can neglect production and degradation rates of ComD and ComE.
Overview of the signalling module
Equation 1: AIP binds to ComD receptor to form a complex (AIP-ComD) AIP + ComD ↔ AIP-ComD
Graph showing production of AIP-ComD
Equation 2: Phosphate binds to the AIP-ComD complex to form another complex (AIP-ComD*) AIP-ComD + Phosphate ↔ AIP-ComD*
Graph showing production of AIP-ComD*
Equation 3: ComE binds to the AIP-ComD* recepetor to form another complex (AIP-ComD*-ComE) AIP-ComD* + ComE ↔ AIP-ComD*-ComE
Graph showing production of AIP-ComD*-ComE
Equation 4: Phosphate group on ComD binds to ComE and forms two products: phosphorylated ComE (ComE*) and AIP-ComD AIP-ComD*-ComE ↔ AIP-ComD + ComE*
Graph showing production of ComE*
Using the Law of Mass Action, we can rewrite these 4 equations:
In the above equations, the forwards reaction constants are represented by k1,2,3,4, for the first, second, third and fourth reaction, respectively. The backwards reaction constants are represented by k-1,-2,-3,-4. Click here for the results of this model...
