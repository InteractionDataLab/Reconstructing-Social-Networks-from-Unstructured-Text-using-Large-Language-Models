Diary Week
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
We embarked on our iGEM project in early July, after finishing our exams and having about a week off for a bit of rest and relaxation. There have been highs, there have been lows, but it's all part of the amazing journey that is iGEM! We really hope you enjoy reading our diary, but if you're a bit short of time we recommend the video diary for a slightly more entertaining experience!
Week Fourteen
This week was Fresher's Week, and it was really odd seeing so many people suddenly flood the campus! We had a really useful meeting on Monday so the whole team could get up to date with our progress so far.
On Wednesday, we held our first Synthetic Biology School Workshop at St Augustine's High School in Kilburn, which was really good fun and informative for both the school students and us. The second and third workshops were held at Harris City Academy in Crystal Palace on Thursday. See the School Workshop page to find out more! We had a meeting with the advisors to get everyone updated about where we were with the project. We also discussed how the assays were going and what results we had got so far.
