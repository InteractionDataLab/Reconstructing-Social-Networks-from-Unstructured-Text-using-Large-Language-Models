In our particular example, the protease of Schistosoma is meant to cleave a protein displayed on the bacteria's cell wall (<I>the pink rectangle on the diagram below</I>). The cleaved peptide is recognized by the receptor which would then activate the colour expression. This solution raised questions about the risk of false positive or whether there are any chances for ComD receptors to be activated in the diluted environment. Modelling of this module would enable us to answer these questions.</P><TABLE style="width:800px;background:#f5f5f5;text-align:justify;font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;color:#555555;"><TBODY><TR><TD>2. <B>Signaling Model</B></TD><TD style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;color:#ea8828;" align="right"><A href="/Team:Imperial_College_London/Modelling/Signalling/Objectives" title="Team:Imperial College London/Modelling/Signalling/Objectives">Objectives</A> | <A href="/Team:Imperial_College_London/Modelling/Signalling/Detailed_Description" title="Team:Imperial College London/Modelling/Signalling/Detailed Description">Description</A> | <A href="/Team:Imperial_College_London/Modelling/Signalling/Parameters_and_Constants" title="Team:Imperial College London/Modelling/Signalling/Parameters and Constants">Constants</A> | <A href="/Team:Imperial_College_London/Modelling/Signalling/Results_and_Conclusion" title="Team:Imperial College London/Modelling/Signalling/Results and Conclusion">Results</A> | <A href="/Team:Imperial_College_London/Modelling/Signalling/Download_MatLab_Files" title="Team:Imperial College London/Modelling/Signalling/Download MatLab Files">MATLAB Code</A></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>We decided to use the ComCDE signaling pathway from <I>S.pneumoniae</I> and so  questions arose on whether it would work appropriately in <I>B.subtilis</I>.
