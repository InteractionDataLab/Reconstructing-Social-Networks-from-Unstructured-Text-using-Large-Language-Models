Acknowledgements
We couldn't have completed this project all by ourselves, and we have many people to thank. Our supervisor Chris Hirst, our advisors, the Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation and the experts we consulted, among many others, made this project possible. Thank you everyone!
We will never be able to thank Chris (our supervisor) enough for all he has done for us. From answering the same question a million times and never losing his patience, to making sure we were all smiling in lab by telling us jokes, his never failing positive attitude made this project a really special one to all of us.
A huge thank you to:
Our advisors, Professor Richard Kitney, Professor Paul Freemont and Dr Geoff Baldwin, for all their guidance throughout the course of the iGEM competition.
Dr Tom Ellis for his amazing stories and always knowing what to say.
Kirsten Jensen for all the work she put into our project.
The rest of the CSynBI, including Dr Guy-Bart Stan, Dr Matthieu Bultelle, James Chappell, Susanna Finlay and Dr Karen Polizzi.
Dr Julie Balen of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for her enthusiasm and public health expertise.
Dr Claire Marris of LSE for her invaluable advice at the Human Practices Panel.
Dr Martha Betson of the Natural History Museum for giving us a crash course in schistosomiasis and the schistosome lifecycle.
David Benqué and Gerrit Kaiser of the Royal College of Art (RCA) for bringing out every ounce of creativity we had in us!
Professor Alan Fenwick and Dr Wendy Harrison of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) for their wisdom in discussing the most appropriate applications for our detection kit.
Imperial College London staff including Professor Murray Selkirk, Dr James MacDonald, Dr Leak, Professor Allain Filloux and Tania Briggs.
Danielle Rounds for designing and providing numerous images for our project.
Dr Kelly Neaves and Dr Dominic Rees-Roberts for making us practice explaining synthetic biology and our project.
Tom Jay for his creative genius in designing the prototypes.
The Wellcome Trust for sponsoring us this summer, and for sponsoring the documentary that Dr Kelly Neaves and Dr Dominic Rees-Roberts filmed.

We are really proud of our project, but we have been lucky enough to have been given a huge amount of guidance, help and patience from our advisors.
The team are responsible for the project idea and the vast majority of the design. Professor Freemont, Professor Kitney and Dr Baldwin helped us strategise and prioritise our efforts over the course of our project.
We were also given loads of really useful advice from Dr Tom Ellis, James Chappell, Chris Hirst, Kirsten Jensen, Dr Guy-Bart Stan, Dr Matthieu Bultelle and Dr Karen Polizzi.
The Human Practices Workshop, which took place on our second day of iGEM, was organised by Susanna Finlay.  The team contacted all of the experts (with the exception of Dr Betson) themselves and organised the meetings with them. The Human Practices Panel Discussion was chaired by Dr Claire Marris.  The modelling team are wholly responsible for the design and simulations.
The lab teams ran all the assays themselves and also did most of the cloning, except a few of the trickier cloning steps, which we were helped with by Kirsten and Chris. Chris also prepared any harmful reagents for us to minimise any health and safety risks.
