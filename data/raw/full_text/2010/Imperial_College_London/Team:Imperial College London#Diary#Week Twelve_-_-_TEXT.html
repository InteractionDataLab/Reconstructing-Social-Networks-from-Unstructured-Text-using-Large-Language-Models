Diary Week
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
We embarked on our iGEM project in early July, after finishing our exams and having about a week off for a bit of rest and relaxation. There have been highs, there have been lows, but it's all part of the amazing journey that is iGEM! We really hope you enjoy reading our diary, but if you're a bit short of time we recommend the video diary for a slightly more entertaining experience!
Week Twelve
Maddie was making two final testing constructs. One was XylE in the 3K3 testing vector and the other was...
She also made a construct with XylE terminator in pSB1C3 ready to accept any promoter because we were waiting on Com and pVeg at the time.  Florian digested the surface protein linker genes to confirm their presence in pSB1C3. He then midiprepped the successful transformants. Piotr PCR'd out XylE in the reverse orientation to insert into the LacI construct.
