Modelling
Overview | Detection Model | Signaling Model | Fast Response Model | Interactions
A major part of the project consisted of modelling each module. This enabled us to decide which ideas we should implement. Look at the Fast Response page for a great example of how modelling has made a major impact on our design!

Parameters and Constants
We can neglect the production and degradation rates. Therefore, the only constants in this model are the forward and backward reaction constants: k1,2,3,4 and k-1,-2,-3,-4. In this model, we will assume that k1,2,3,4=107 and k-1,-2,-3,-4=103.
