Want to know what we've been up to this summer? Need to know how to structure your Synthetic Biology School Workshop? Or do you just want to check out some pictures of our project? No worries, just sit back and relax! We've compiled a whole host of videos and images to give you a taste of what we've been up to.

Building prototypes informed our design
We wanted our kit to be as useful as possible
This is the first design...
A prototype of our dipstick concept!! So cool!!!
More pictures of our awesome prototype!!!
School Workshops
Brainstorming
Chameleon: Now you see me - now you don't
More brainstorming
...and more brainstorming
Ideas on regulation of Synthetic Biology
H'n'H sauce (Hot&Healthy) - yummy
More ideas on regulations of SynBio
Brainstorming again
