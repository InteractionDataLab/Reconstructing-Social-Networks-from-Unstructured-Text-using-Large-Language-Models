Human Practices
Overview | Panel | Workshop | Meetings | Report | Documentary
Human practices has been a hugely important influence in the design of our final product. We contacted a number of experts very early on in the design process to allow us to truly adapt our specifications to meet the requirements of a field testing kit for parasites. This has ensured that our design is as feasible and useful as possible.
Overview
Throughout our iGEM project we have ensured that Human Practices have truly informed our design specifications. For us, this is one of the fundamental aspects of synthetic biology and we hope that it will continue to be viewed as such within the iGEM competition, as well as the wider community of synthetic biologists all over the world.
In addition to holding various workshops and discussions from the very beginning of our project, we have designed a program for Synthetic Biology School Workshops . Having run a series of these workshops, we are confident that other iGEM teams can run their own workshops with little effort.
We have contributed vectors to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts that;
Allow the removal of antibiotic resistance genes used during cloning by Dif excision in B. subtilis.
Allow the integration within essential genes in the B. subtilis genome.
Furthermore, the substrate required for the output signal of our detection kit eventually leads to the death of the cells. For more information on how we tested this, please visit the Experiment 4 page.
