Lab Diaries
Overview | Surface Protein Team | XylE Team | Vectors Team | Modelling Team
Here are the technical diaries for our project. We've split them up into three lab teams and the modelling team. We think it's really important that absolutely anyone can find out what we've been doing. For a really detailed look at what we did, and when, you've come to the right place!
Lab Diaries
We have ensured that everything we do in the lab is available for the rest of the team, as well as anyone else, to see. Transparency is a really important aspect of synthetic biology, and we'd love it if other lab teams would do the same.
Keeping up-to-date lab diaries was also a really easy way of keeping track of where each team is, especially for our advisors!
