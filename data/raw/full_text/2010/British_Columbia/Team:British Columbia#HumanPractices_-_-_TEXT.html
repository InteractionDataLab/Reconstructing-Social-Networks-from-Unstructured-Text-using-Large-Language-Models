Synthetic Biology & Society
Whether it's agriculture, healthcare, the environment or the economy, synthetic biology has an increasingly important role to play! Join in our discussions!
Our Forum
NaNoWriMo x iGEM
In our first collaboration ever, iGEM and NaNoWriMo unite to showcase stories featuring synthetic biology! Follow these novelists over the month of November!
Once upon a time...
Art disturbs, science reassures ~Georges Braque
What can generate more inspiration or discussion than art? And what is not art? Come take a look. Better yet, contribute!
Be disturbed!
Promoter Maps
We collected hundreds of definitions of synthetic biology from the UBC community-undergrads, grad students and faculty from various disciplines. These definitions were sorted by field/occupation as well as level of education in order to synthesize these promoter maps. Each promoter map consists of words arranged from highest to lowest frequency (with implemented cut-off points), representing the prevalent ideas in our community's awareness of synthetic biology!
Word Clouds
Can't get enough? We've got a storm of word clouds headed this way. Each represents definitions of synthetic biology from students in different disciplines!
The Synthetic Biology Art Gallery
"Art is the Queen of all sciences communicating knowledge to all the generations of the world." -Leonardo da Vinci
"Good art is not what it looks like, but what it does to us." -Roy Adzak
"Art is literacy of the heart." -Elliot Eisner
"The job of the artist is always to deepen the mystery."  -Francis Bacon
"What a society deems important is enshrined in its art." -Harry Broudy
Whatever your thoughts on art are, come visit our gallery and send us your very own artwork on synthetic biology!
NaNoWriMo
National Novel Writing Month participants aim to write an astounding 50,000-word novel within the month of November. In our first collaboration ever, iGEM and NaNoWriMo unite to showcase stories featuring synthetic biology !
