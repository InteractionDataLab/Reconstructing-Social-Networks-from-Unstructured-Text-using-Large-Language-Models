Summary of Equations
Variables:
z = depth of the biofilm structure
x = depth of the phage-infested layer
ε = portion of the biofilm population susceptible to phage infection
BT = total biofilm bacteria population
Bu = uninfected biofilm bacteria subpopulation
Bi = infected biofilm bacteria subpopulation
BL = bacteria subpopulation infected with phage in latent phase
Bl = bacteria subpopulation infected with phage in lytic cycle
P = phage particle population
rin = diffusion rate of phage particles into the biofilm structure
[DspB] = extracellular DspB concentration (inside biofilm)
[AIP] = extracellular AIP concentration (inside biofilm)
Parameters:
A = cross-sectional area of the biofilm container
D = maximum biofilm thickness; related to K
d = diameter of a biofilm bacterium
α = EPS occupancy constant (corrects for the space EPS occupies around a bacterium)
K = carrying capacity of the biofilm
p = portion of the bacteria in the infected subpopulation that are infected by phage in latent phase
ρ = bacterial growth rate of the total population (T), and the uninfected (u) and infected (i) subpopulations
λ = host lysis rate
π = rate at which phage switches from latent to lytic phase in its host cell after infection
κ= portion of phage particles successfully infecting a host cell
η = phage half-life
R = number of phage particles released per lysis
δ = percentage of phage and DspB diffusing out of the system (mechanical removal from biofilm)
Y = diffusion linear proportionality constant
S = amount of DspB enzyme released per lysis
σ = rate of AIP production
γ= rate of AIP degradation and/or mechanical removal from the system
[AIP]thres= threshold level of AIP concentration above which phage and DspB production are activated
[AIP]max= maximum level of AIP concentration inside the biofilm
rout = diffusion rate of phage particles out of the biofilm and towards boundary layer
rmax = max diffusion rate of phage particles into the biofilm
rmin = min diffusion rate of phage particles into the biofilm, i.e. base rate
