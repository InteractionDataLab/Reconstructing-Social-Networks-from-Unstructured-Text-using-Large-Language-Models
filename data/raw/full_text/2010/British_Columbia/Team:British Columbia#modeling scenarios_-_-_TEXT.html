Scenarios
Although our model was initially developed to simulate the behavior of our genetically engineered (GE) system, it can be applied to predict the dynamics of other biofilm systems that are introduced to a biofilm matrix-degrading phage. By setting the model parameters to values that represent the properties of a real-world biofilm system, we can simulate scenarios where the biofilms are exposed to a GE phage functionally similar to ours. We can also incorporate information on the properties of the phage by modifying certain parameters. Below, we present results for simulations of medically relevant biofilm scenarios where GE phage may be considered for the therapeutic solution.
