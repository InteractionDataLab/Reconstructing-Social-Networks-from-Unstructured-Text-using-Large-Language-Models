Introduction
We developed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the biofilm structure (in terms of bacterial population size) and the interactions among the major components, including the engineered phage and DispersinB (DspB) protein. We used numerical simulations to predict the impact of phage and DspB release on the biofilm structure. We also investigated the weight of each parameter to the design of our system with sensitivity analysis. Possible scenarios of biofilm degradation suggested by our model are explored.
