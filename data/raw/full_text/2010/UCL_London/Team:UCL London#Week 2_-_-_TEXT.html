Week 2 - Research
5th-11th July
This week was individual research more than anything else really. Everybody had their temporary roles assigned as not everyone was available at the start of this project, and we spent most of our time researching into synthetic biology and its wider aspects. We were intrigued by the concept of Synthetic Biology and its capability to revolutionize so many different aspects of our life in the decades to come. There really is so much potential, and it made a lot of us believe that we can really make this work, especially as our project is one that can be applied and is of real substance to society at large.
