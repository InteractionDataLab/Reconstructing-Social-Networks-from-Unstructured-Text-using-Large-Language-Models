Doxycycline Economic Analysis
Doxycycline Biorocess Flowsheet
Cost
Estimate of Doxycycline cost for an industrial scale fermentation based on the 1,000L mammalian cell model
From Sigma Aldrich website for Doxycycline hyclate cost is $ 32.20 for 1 gram of Doxycycline
Finally for a 1,000 L fermentation batch, this is how much Doxycycline you need is 0.012 kg per 1,000 L batch
Cost of Doxycycline per a batch: 12 (gram/batch) * 32.20 ($ / gram) = $386.40 per a 1,000 batch
Bioprocess Flowsheet
A bioprocess flowsheet was constructed with regards to the mammalian cell system, in order to define all the necessary upstream and downstream steps and assess whether this choice is a feasible one.
The main steps for the antibody production expressed in mammalian cell culture are the primary recovery, primary purification, viral inactivation, secondary purification and viral exclusion prior to formulation, as indicated by the following SuperPro flowsheet.

Equipment Cost $
Doxycline is added from a holding tank, absence of doxycline will make minimal difference to USP costs.
DSP costs are very high, that a cost reduction in the USP section has no significant difference to the total equipment costs

Throughput Analysis
On SuperPro it assumes it would take 60 minutes to set up the Doxycline inlet This is 0.3 % of the overall process, delay in set up doesn't have a profound effect.
