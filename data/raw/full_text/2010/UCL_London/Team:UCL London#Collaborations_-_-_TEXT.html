Collaborations
This summer, as the UCL iGEM team, we really knew that the sky was the limit! And we knew that to do so, one must aim high and far, and that involves working with people outside your own geographic area and discipline. Not only that, one of the criteria for GOLD is the collaborations with other universities participating in iGEM competition. We did aim to make this project as multidisciplinary as possible, involving people with a variety of background and skills. Our collaboration took multiple forms, from the development of new standards for Parts Registry and user-friendly Parts, to the ethics aspect by filling out surveys of other iGEM teams.
Art & Design Institutes
From the beginning, we have been working very closely with students from both Slade school of Arts and Central Saint Martin's College of Art & Design. They have been an integral part of all the design and artistic aspects of our project from that of the poster, to the wiki page and T-shirts etc. It has been a great challenge to bring individuals from outside are discipline, and introduce them to our work and enable them to understand the prime elements of what we are doing so that they can then grasp this and be able to put it in some sort of artistic form.  For a sneak preview of their work, visit their page Designs
Cambridge Part Development
The initial stages of our project relied of the use of one of Cambridge's successful parts from iGEM 2009, and Visible Red dye Pathway which would help prove that our genetic circuit works by being activated and releasing a red dye. a few weeks in, we realised that this particular part was not compatible to our circuit. At that point we had to decide on the use of another part, and so we took this as an opportunity to help Cambridge develop that part so that it is more suitable in its application. It was exciting and great to work closely with them and help them to improve and adapt there 2009 part, paving the way for them to potentially go ahead and characterize in the near future if not now.

We even reviewed their part for them, to read the review click on the following Cambridge Part Review .
Bristol BSim Modeling
Having met some members of the Bristol team at Newcastle's iGEM workshop earlier in the summer, we became interested in each other's project, and especially in Bristol's BSim Modeling software. From that point onwards, we decided to set up a collaboration between the two teams. We can conclude that it was a successful, win-win collaboration in every aspect.
BCCS-Bristol and in particular Neeraj Oak and Tom Todd, were in very close collaboration with our Modelling & Medals Criteria Champion Elena Pallari, for the establishment of a fruitful co-operation. This multidisciplinary collaboration between team members of both teams emphasises the spirit of iGEM 2010. The model did work with some amazing video simulations of our genetic circuit based on the mathematical equations using the BSim software. A big THANK you from the UCL iGEM team 2010 to the BCCS-Bristol iGEM team 2010. Click on the following link to understand more about how the BSim modelling program works Bristol BSim

Sheffield Team Questionaire
Sheffield's iGEM team this year conducted a survey amongst all the teams, and in the spirit of collaboration, we participated and answered the questions which overall focused on the ethical side of Synthetic Biology and so we wanted to contributre to this by filling out their questionnaire. A survey was conducted among iGEM Teams by the Team Sheffield .
METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE Team Survey
Turkey's Software team also conducted a survey but were mainly interested their effort to develop new standards for Parts Registry and user-friendly Part. We felt that this is without a doubt a concept that could without a doubt benefit iGEM teams for years to come and so we participated in this survey. METU Turkey Team 2010

University of Edinburgh iGEM Team Questionaire
Our team, has responded to Matt Coombes from the University of Edinburgh, about our perception of iGEM. We hope that our answers enable them to gain a breadth and depth understanding of the iGEM competition. A better insight into the competition run by MIT since 2006, can even increase public awareness and attrack new competitor teams to join the competition next year. Edinburgh Team 2010 .
