CaCl2 Competent Bacteria - Generating and Transforming
Generating
Before Starting;
Pour minimal media plates. 5x M9 salts etc overleaf. Prepare 100ml LB per strain. Prepare 50ml ice cold 0.1M CaCl2 / 15% glycerol per strain Pre-chill eppendorf tubes
Day 1
1 Streak cells on minimal agar plate. Incubate 37C overnight.
Day 2
2 Pick a colony into 5ml LB + 100µl 1M MgSO4 Incubate 37C in shaker overnight.
Day 3
3 Inoculate 100ml LB in pre-warmed conical with 1ml of the 5ml O/N culture from Day 2.
4 Incubate 2hrs in 37C shaker until the cells at early log phase of growth curve (A600 ~ 0.3)
5 Transfer to chilled, sterile 50ml Falcon tube and incubate on ice 10min
6 Cf 3300g 5min in benchtop RmT. Cf.
7 Resus in 10ml ice cold 0.1M CaCl2 / 15% glycerol and incubate on ice 30min
8 Cf 3300g 5min in benchtop RmT. Cf.
9 Resus in 1ml ice cold 0.1M CaCl2 / 15% glycerol.
Transfer 100µl aliquots to pre-chilled, pre-labelled eppendorf tubes. Store -70C.
Solutions
5x M9 salts in 500ml dH20.
Na2HPO4 32g   KH2PO4 7.5g   NaCl         1.25g   NH4Cl 2.5g
Minimal media plates for competence
In 50 ml Falcon;
39ml  melted Bacteriological Agar solution (=50C) 10ml  5x M9 salt solution 1ml  20% (w/v) D-glucose 50µl  2mg ml-1 thiamine 5µl  1M CaCl2 100µl  1M MgSO4
0.1M CaCl2 / 15% glycerol
In 50 ml Falcon;
5ml  1M CaCl2  7.5ml  100% glycerol
Transforming
Before Starting
Prepare 5ml LB per strain. Prepare appropriately selective nutrient agar plates
Day 1
1 Add 1-5 µg of ice cold DNA to 100 µl of competent cells on ice.  Incubating for 45 min.
2 Heat shock cells by placing tubes in 37C water bath for 10min.
3 Place cells on ice 2 min
4 Add cells to 5ml LB (in 15ml or 50ml tube). Shake for 1 hour at 37C.
5 Plate at least 100µl onto selective nutrient agar plates.
Day 2
6 Pick a colony into 2ml selective LB. Incubate 37C in shaker overnight.
