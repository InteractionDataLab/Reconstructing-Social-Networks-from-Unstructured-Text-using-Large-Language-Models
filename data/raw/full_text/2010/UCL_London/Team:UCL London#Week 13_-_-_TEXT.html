"What Is Fear Of Need But Need Itself"- Week 13
20th - 26th September 2010
Omar, our champion of champions was out with a knee injury. Being the champion that he is, he spent his weekend writing to companies for sponsorship.
Conclusion: It is such a bad time to ask companies for money!
Even with an injured knee, Omar still came in on crutches. Seriously, if there were to be an award for motivation we would have that in the bag. Usual lab work, and paper work. The whole sponsorship issue is getting a bit annoying, but it'll work itself out.
In labs, we prepared the LB agar and autoclaved the equipment needed for fermentation. We also autoclaved 4 1 Litre flasks in preparation for the upcoming fermentation week required to characterise our parts.
