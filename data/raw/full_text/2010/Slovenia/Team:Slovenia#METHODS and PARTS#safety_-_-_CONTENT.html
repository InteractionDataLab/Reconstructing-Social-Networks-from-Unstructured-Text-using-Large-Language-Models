Furthermore, the public and the environmental safety were considered.However, most of our project concerned working with non-infectious host organisms (Biosafety level 1 and 2) so no major risks have been identified. 
</P><P>Nonetheless, standard precautions and instructions of good laboratory practice have been employed before we began with experimental work.  Every student had to pass the mandatory course  on Occupational Health and Fire safety that included working with genetically modified organism, handling toxic waste and how to assess and handle accidents in the laboratory. The general precautions like wearing gloves or decontaminating waste material in antibacterial substances, for instance asepsol, staying focused during the experimental work were practiced. In addition,  the project team was divided into several sub-groups of students whose work was closely supervised by senior mentors. Such work organization proved to be safer and more efficient.
</P><P>In regards to public and environmental safety it should be taken into account, that it is illegal to transfer genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. However, GMOs that we developed in the laboratory have been adapted to prevent their replication, therefore, their survival outside the laboratory.
</P><P>In conclusion, we believe we took all the necessary precautions to prevent spread of the GMO to the environment and decrease the chance of personal injury. </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Safety_and_2010_iGEM_team_Slovenia_project">Safety and 2010 iGEM team Slovenia project</SPAN></H2><P>The laboratory in which the experimental work has been performed was approved to work with GMOs of Biosafety level 1 and 2 (Approval documents BSL1 - 35417-6/2010-7 and BSL2 0014/2008). With rapid development of biotechnology, safety must be considered a top priority with new applications. We believe our new principle does not compromise issues of general safety, since natural components of cells are used to improve functions of the original cell. All parts that were used in this project have, to our knowledge, do not increase the antibiotic sensitivity of the GMOs used, do not express toxic genes, and in general have little or no potential toxic effect to humans, animals or environment. However, precautions still need to be taken, since the exact impact of our project on public, environmental and general safety, per se, have not yet be determined. 
</P><P>Moreover, our project allows the possibility of in vitro synthesis of any chosen compound with addition of the original substrate, which reduces the risk and ethical issues of genetically modified organisms. None the less, even with in vivo production, we believe our project does not endanger any kind of safety, since the compounds our team decided to syntesise are not only harmless, but rather beneficial to human health and general well-being.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Local_and_national_bio-safety_committees_and_novel_potential_safety_issues_associated_with_Biobricks">Local and national bio-safety committees and novel potential safety issues associated with Biobricks</SPAN></H2><P>The project and the self-evaluation of safety risk were reviewed by the Department's biological safety officer. The officers task is to asses if the mentors are qualified to supervise the proposed research and whether the laboratories hold the nationally required licenses to host the proposed research. The National Institute of Chemistry holds a license to work with the genetically modified organisms (Approval documents BSL1 - 35417-6/2010-7 and BSL2 0014/8). The local bio-safety officer also evaluated new risk assessment for all new Biobrick parts and work related with them. Project this year included mainly production of recombinant chimeric enzymes and non-hazardous compounds in the strain of E. coli, which is considered to be low risk. This kind of production is performed daily in the lab at the National institute of chemistry.
</P><P>In conclusion, the self-evaluation of risk assessment of the proposed project (including Biobricks) and the local biosafety officer’s review of the proposal did not recognize potential hazards or increased biosafety risk to researchers, public or environment.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Synthetic_biology_and_safety">Synthetic biology and safety</SPAN></H2><P>The field of synthetic biology is defined as »the engineering of biological components and systems that do not exist in nature and are re-engineering of existing biological elements«. The basis of research in synthetic biology is a modification of biological system behavior by mutation of its genetic code. With extremely rapid progress of synthetic biology field many ethical concerns and questions are raised. They must be addressed to scientific as well as lay public.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
