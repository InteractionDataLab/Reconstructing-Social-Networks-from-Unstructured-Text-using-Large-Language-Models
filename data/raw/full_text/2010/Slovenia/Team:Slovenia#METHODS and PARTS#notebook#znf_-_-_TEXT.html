DH5α cells were transformed with pSB1AK3 plasmid containing RBS-lacZ(full) insert and plated on LB with ampicylin (Amp). Single colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night culture. The plasmid was cut with EcoRI and SpeI enzymes and the RBS-lacZ(full) fragment was isolated from agarose gel and ligated into pSB1AK3 vector containing DTER, which was previously cut with EcoRI and XbaI enzymes and isolated from the gel.
6/6/2010 – 6/12/2010
A synthetic promotor pSYN_BbsI was ligated into pSB1AK3 vector with DTER. DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation product and put on LB Amp agar plates. Single colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures. Restriction analysis with EcoRI and PstI enzymes was performed.

pSB1AK3 plasmid with DTER-pSYN_BbsI was cut with BbsI enzyme and isolated from the gel. Primer annealing was done for the Gli1, HivC and Tet operators, and the fragments were ligated into the cut vector. DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation product and plated on LB Amp.
6/14/2010 – 6/20/2010
Colony PCR was performed to ascertain which colonies contained plasmids coding for Zinc-fingers and Tet operators. Positive colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures and sent to sequencing.
6/21/2010 - 6/27/2010
Sequencing results showed that the ligations of Zinc-finger operators were succesful, unlike the ligation of Tet operator. Primer annealing was performed again and the whole process was repeated.     DB3.1 cells were transformed with pSB4C5 plasmid, which was taken from the Registry. The cells were grown on LB chloramphenicol (Cm) agar plates and later inoculated into liquid LB media with Cm.
6/28/2010 – 7/4/2010
pSB1AK3 vector containg BsaI_DTER was cut with EcoRI and XbaI enzymes and isolated from agarose gel. pBAD/araC fragment, which was previously cut with EcoRI and SpeI enzymes and isolated from the gel, was ligated into the latter vector and DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation products and plated on LB Amp. Single colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures. Restriction analysis for the construct pBAD/araC-BsaI-DTER was performed with the enzymes EcoRI and PstI.
pSB4C5 plasmid was isolated from the over-night culture and restriction analysis with the enzyme AvaI was performed.
Sequencing results showed that the second ligation of Tet operator into the pSB1AK3 vector containing DTER-pSYN_BbsI was unsuccesful again. Another set of primers for annealing of the Tet operator were designed and ordered. Alongside these, primers for annealing of ATG and the rest of the Zinc-finger operators were designed and ordered.
7/5/2010 – 7/11/2010
The pBAD/araC-BsaI-DTER fragment was cut with XbaI and PstI enzymes and isolated from the gel.

DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation products and plated on LB Amp. Single colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures and restriction analysis with EcoRI and PstI enzymes was performed.     Restriction of pSB4C5 plasmid with EcoRI and PstI was performed. The plasmid backbone was isolated from the gel and stored for later use.
7/12/2010 - 7/18/2010
Primers with ATG arrived. Annealing of ATG primers was done and the fragment was then ligated into pSB1AK3 vector. DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation product and plated on LB Amp. Colony PCR was performed and positive colonies were inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was later isolated and sent to sequencing.     pSB1AK3 vectors with STOP and His STOP were cut with EcoRI and XbaI enzymes and pSB1AK3 vector with ATG His was cut with SpeI and PstI enzymes. All plasmid backbones were later isolated from the gel.
7/19/2010 – 7/25/2010
Primers with Zinc-finger and Tet operators finally arrived! Annealing of the primers was done and the fragments were then ligated into pSB1AK3 vector with DTER-pSYN, which was previously cut with BbsI enzyme and isolated from the gel. DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation products and plated on LB Amp. Colony PCR was performed and positive colonies were inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was later isolated and sent to sequencing.
At the end of the week, a package from GeneArt with our Zinc-fingers came,  which were transformed into DH5α cells. Colonies grown on LB Amp agar plates were later inoculated intoliquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures.
7/26./2010 – 8/1/2010
Plasmids with Zinc-fingers were cut with EcoRI/SpeI and XbaI/PstI enzymes. The Zinc-finger fragments were then isolated from the gel and ligated into pSB1AK3 vectors with ATG His, STOP and His STOP. DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation product and plated on LB Amp. Colony PCR was performed and positive colonies were later inoculated into liquid LB media with Amp and plasmid DNA was isolated from the over-night cultures.
Sequencing results showed that all ligations of Zinc-finger operators were unsuccessful. The pSB1AK3 vector with DTER-pSYN was cut with BbsI enzyme and isolated from the gel again and primer annealing was repeated.
