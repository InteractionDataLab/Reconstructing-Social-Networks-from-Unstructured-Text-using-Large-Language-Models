We predicted that DNA program sequence will promote a reconstitution of both pairs of split GFPs and FRET among reconstituted split GFPs. To achive that, cells have to express all four chimeric proteins and contain a DNA program sequence as well, all localised in the same region. Proving the principle in this way was achieved by FRET in mammalian cells. Selection of cells for FRET measurements is critical and is demonstrated below as well as proof for nuclear colocalisation of reconstituted split GFPs.

In order to prove FRET using selected FRET pair, CFP and YFP, the acceptor photobleaching method was used. When acceptor, YFP, is bleached, the fluorescence intensity of donor increases and this is an indication of FRET. The higher an increase in fluorescence intensity of donor after photobleaching of acceptor, the higher the FRET efficiency.
We observed fluorescence emission of acceptor pair indicating the FRET effect in transfected HEK293 cells. However for the reliable verification of the FRET effect we performed photobleaching, as described below, which should in case of FRET effect cause increase of the donor fluorescence.

Overlay image of cells varying from light green (donor is reconstituted more efficiently), yellow-orange (both split GFPs have similar reassembly efficiency), reddish (acceptor is reconstituted more efficiently). This experiment shows the presence of three groups of transfected cells in cell populations: cells expressing only one of both split proteins (meaning reassembled mCeruelan or mCitrine) and cells expressing all chimeric proteins leading to reconstiturion of both split fluorescent proteins at once. However all cells that exhibit fluorescence contain DNA program sequence.

</P><P><B>Figure 5: Quantification of the FRET effect upon addition of DNA program. </B>Acceptor photobleaching method was used to determine the FRET efficiency. FRET efficiencies were calculated using FRET AB method within the LAS AF software (Leica). The method calculates an increase in donor (mCerulean) signal intensity as a consequence of bleached acceptor (mCitrine). Selected bleaching point in the acceptor channel was fully photobleached with 514nm laser light. Absolute numbers for FRET efficiencies using split GFPs to reconstitute FRET were normalised to negative control, being cytosolic mCerulean and mCitrine, to give us fold excess in FRET efficiency between the samples. Student's t-test with one tail and unequal variance was used to prove FRET statistically. We determined that there is only 0,45% probability that the datasets for negative control and FRET on a DNA program are the same. FRET efficiency was calculated for cells which were positive for both reconstituted split GFPs: mCerulean and mCitrine.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion">Discussion</SPAN></H2><P>Our results clearly demonstrate that DNA program sequence could be used as a scaffold for four chimeric proteins. This was proved with FRET among four functional proteins linked to zinc fingers. DNA program sequence facilitated reconstitution of mature GFPs and in addition also positioned both GFPs in a manner so that FRET was detected. FRET efficiency was detected for the negative control. This might be a consequence of fixing the cells and bringing highly expressed cytosolic GFPs close enough to detect FRET.
</P><P>We can conclude from the evidence that we can assemble four chimeric proteins in a defined order using DNA scaffold. Reconstituted fluorescent proteins and FRET effect prove the concept of DNA-guided assembly of functional proteins that could be used for different applications.
