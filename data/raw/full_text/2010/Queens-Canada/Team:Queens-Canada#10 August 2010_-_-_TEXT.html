Gel Electrophoresis
Yuli
eGFP, pFlp-1
Used 0.4 g agarose in 60 mL TBE.  Gel run for 45 mins at 100 V.
PCR
Hao
eYFP, mCherry, ChR2
Program run using 9:1 FAST:HIFI blend with an extension time of 15 s and annealing temperature of 65 °C.
eYFP and mCherry were run for 10 cycles without primers, then 20 cycles after primers were added. The Annealing temperature was changed to 61 °C once primers were added.
eCFP was run for 20 cycles.
