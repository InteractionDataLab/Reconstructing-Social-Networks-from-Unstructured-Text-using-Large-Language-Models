Mike is experienced in mathematical modelling, and the physical sciences affiliated with engineering tasks. He came to the iGEM team in 2009 because of his interests in the wide-range of applications in the field of synthetic biology and systematic engineering. Aside from his studies and QGEM he enjoys playing a variety of sports including hockey, soccer and golf.</P></DIV><DIV class="person"><SPAN class="name">Hao Shi</SPAN><A href="mailto:hao.shi@qgemteam.com">email</A><P>&quot;<I>How</I> is <I>she</I> doin'?&quot; Yup, that's how I will introduce myself if we ever meet. I'm just a guy going into 3rd year Life Sciences aiming to enter medical school like any other life-sci. Aside from that ambition, I have a little engineer inside my brain that craves innovative challenges, which is what brought me to iGEM. To top that off, I need to admit my addiction to badminton... it takes up about 20% of my awake-hours each week. Sherlock Holmes would deduce either I sleep a lot or I play a lot of badminton... or I might be over-exaggerating. Summary: Med school + engineer + badminton = Hao Shi = Awesome!!

Therefore he contributes knowledge in both molecular biology and chemistry to the team. Nelson joined QGEM 2010 as a volunteer because of his interest in exploring the cool and interesting aspects of synthetic biology and his desire to gain experience in the lab. Also, Nelson has a interest for all kinds of sports including badminton, pingpong, soccer etc, and he is a basketball lunatic.</P></DIV><DIV class="person"><SPAN class="name">Yuli Zhang</SPAN><A href="mailto:yuli.zhang@qgemteam.com">email</A><P>Hi. I am a third year life sciences student. I am really interested in molecular genetics and participating in the iGEM competition as a QGEM member has given me the chance to learn more about synthetic biology. The QGEM team worked on engineering <I>C. elegans</I> this past summer. The project was very challenging (if you don’t believe me, try going through all of our gel images) and yet very rewarding (we got a transgenic worm)! The team worked mostly in Dr. Chin-Sang’s lab. When we are running gels we didn’t want to mistakenly take one of the lab’s gel, so we wrote, “You can run, but you can’t hide. iGEM” on tissue paper and laid it under our gel box. What it meant was the DNA can run through the gel by applying an electric field but afterwards, we can image the gel and find the DNA band.</P></DIV><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Advisors">Advisors</SPAN></H1><DIV class="person"><SPAN class="name">Ian Chin-Sang</SPAN><A href="mailto:chinsang@queensu.ca">email</A> | <A target="_new" href="http://chin-sang.ca">lab</A><P>Faculty: Arts &amp; Science
