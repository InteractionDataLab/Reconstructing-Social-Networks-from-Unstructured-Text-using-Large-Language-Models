About C. elegans
Caenorhabditis elegans is a nematode usually found in temperate soil. It is transparent, approximately 1 mm in length, and has been used as a model organism since 1974. Genomic sequencing was completed in 2002, making C. elegans the first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced. The C. elegans genome is approximately 100 million base pairs in length and contains around 20,100 genes.

Reproduction and morphogenesis
Like most animals and many other eukaryotes, C. elegans is diploid. Comparative studies of other members of the genus Caenorhabditis suggest that they most likely evolved with a normal balance between female (XX karyotype) and male (X0 karyotype; only one sex chromosome) sexes, however modern-day C. elegans reproduces primarily through the self-fertilisation of hermaphrodites (which make up 99.5% of the population.)
Why C. elegans?
C. elegans is eukaryotic.
C. elegans is a multicellular organism, with different tissues that can be modified separately.
C. elegans research has led to 3 Nobel Prizes in the past 8 years.
