Single colony of our synthesis system or control (without beta-carotene genes) bacteria was inoculated into LB medium containing 34  μg/ml chloramphenical , then incubated at 37℃ overnight. The next day, the absorbance of the overnight cultures was measured at 600 nm and 0.1 OD of diluted bacterial culture (1 ml) was inoculated into 40 ml fresh LB/chloramphenical broth, then grow the culture at 37℃ incubator. We aliquot the bacterial culture (1 ml) every 2 hours and measured the bacterial growth by spectrophotometer at 600nm. Finally, we determine and draw the bacterial growth curve of our synthesis system E. coli. The Figure shows the growth curve of our synthesis system or control E. coli. The result shows that both control (green curve) and synthesis system (synthesizer, orange curve) E. coli reached to plateau at 8 h and grown equally well. We prove that the growth of synthesis system (containing part BBa_k274200) is well in the same growth condition compared with control.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Beta-carotene_Productivity_of_Synthesis_System_E._coli"> Beta-carotene Productivity of Synthesis System E. coli</SPAN></H4><P>The level of beta-carotene production was measured every two hours.

The result shows that that the level of the beta-carotene in our synthesis system contained part BBa_K419012 (synthesizer, orange curve) was elevated at 4 hour and reached a maximum level at 8 h. No beta-carotene was produced in the control E. coli (green curve). </P><P>
The level of beta-carotene was calculated by the concentration standard curve of beta-carotene. The commercial available beta-carotene was purchased and established the concentration curve of beta-carotene as shown in the following Figure.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Estimation_of_the_bacterial_numbers_of_synthesis_system_E._coli">Estimation of the bacterial numbers of synthesis system E. coli</SPAN></H4><P>Figure shows that the calculation of the total number of the synthesis system E. coli.
