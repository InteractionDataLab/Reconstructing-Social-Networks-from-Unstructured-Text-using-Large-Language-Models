Safety
The Uppsala 2010 iGEM team took safety considerations seriously throughout our project. We followed [www.fotomol.uu.se/Utbildning/documents/Safetymanual.pdf FotoMol safety regulations]  in the lab.
Apart from following the general safety regulations we also came up with Brick BAT for assessing the biosafety of the bio bricks and grouping them into safety categories. More details of Brick BAT can be found in the Brick BAT page .
