The K4, K5 and K6 construct are composed of J1, J2 and J3 assembled with BB_I0460 which contains both Ampicillin and Kanamycin cassettes in its backbone, psB1AK3, and the J- construct contains Chloramphinicol cassette, psB1C3. The Tetracyclin antibiotic hasn’t work as expected. Therefore the 3A assembly technique wouldn’t be possible to apply due there is no antibiotics left available with a corresponding backbone.
One option to get around this obstacle was to run the gel, after digestion of BB_I04060, and cut the band with the Biobrick-length and then 3A assembly it with the J-construct and E-P digested psB1C3.
Another option was to switch backbone of J-construct to psB1C3 and then use 3A-assembly it with BB_I0460 and E-P digested psB1C3. We used the second method because it’s a more safer way even though it takes longer time to finish.
Ligation of: J1 = I1+H6 , J2 = I2 + H3, J3 = I3 + H8.to a psB1C3 – vector. Transformation and incubation overnight.
