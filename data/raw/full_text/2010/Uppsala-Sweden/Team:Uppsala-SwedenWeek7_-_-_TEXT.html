Preparation for getting the bricks:
(1)Competent cell preparation
(2)Transformation of the Biobricks into DH5-alpha competent cells
(3)Verificiation of the lengths of the biobricks by Gel Electrophoresis after PCR.
Lab Setup
We prepared the Competent cells to transform the Bio-bricks obtained from the registry.
Preparation of competent cells
1.Start with preparing competent cells protocol
2.Pour out the 250mL cultivation solution
250/6 = 41.88 ≈ 42mL
3.Separate into 6 falcon tubes ×42mL
4.3000 g centrifugation at 4℃for 10 mins
5.Liquid taken away from supernatant
6.Then, cells in each tube was resuspended with 1mL CCMB80 buffer
Media was prepared and plated with appropriate Antibiotics.
LB medium
800mL H2O
16g LB-broth powder
 Adjust the medium to pH= 7.49
LB agar medium
800mL H2O
 12g agar
16g LB-broth powder
 Adjust the medium to pH= 7.51
Agar plate preparation with ampicillin
Amipicillin stock concentration=100mg/mL
Volume of agar medium=800mL
Ampicillin concentration required = 0.1mg/mL
Mamp=800mL × 0.1mg /mL= 80mg
Vsoc, with amp= 80mg /100mg/mL= 0.8mL in the 800mL SOC medium
The colonies obtained were amplified by colony PCR. (Refer to the PCR protocol for further details). The PCR product was run on a GEL to verify whether the Bio-bricks are of correct lengths. Having verified the lengths of the Bio-bricks the selected colonies were inoculated over night. The inoculated colonies were extracted.
