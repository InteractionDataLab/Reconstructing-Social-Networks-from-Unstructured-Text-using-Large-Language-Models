Identification of Bio-bricks
Plasmid of the samples which showed right size band on the gel were sent to a plasmid concentration test. We decided only F2, F6, F7, F8, F15 and F16 were in good concentration to proceed.

As the first PCR didn't show the length of all biobricks, the samples failed last time were sent to run another c-PCR. The result was showed in Fig.1
Figure 1
However, only sample F11 shows the band with right size on the gel pic.  Samples, F1, F3, F4, F5, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14 and F17 were inoculated again to get enough plasmid for further use. Second colony PCR was performed again for all the starting biobricks and the products were run for gel again. Comparing the DNA length to the band size, all the biobricks were confirmed, except for F16.
Figure 2
The concentration of plasmid were measured for all the samples and values were showed in Table 2

Plasmid of F1, F2, F4, F9,F10,F12, F17,ccdb C3 and ccdb K3 were digested with proper enzymes bought from Sigma-Aldrich. The biobricks were ligated in pairs according to the plan by Quick Ligase kit from Fermentas. The ligation product were transformed into DH5α competent cells and each sample were plated on the agar plate which antibiotics matched to its backbone antibiotic resistance.
