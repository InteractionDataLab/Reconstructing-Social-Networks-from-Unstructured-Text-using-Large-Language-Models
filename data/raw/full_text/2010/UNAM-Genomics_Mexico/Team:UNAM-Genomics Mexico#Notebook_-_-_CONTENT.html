</P><P><B>The trpR gene from the mutant strain doesn’t have a frameshift, instead of that it has a non synonymous mutation (Alanine to Proline) corresponding to the aminoacid 80</B>.

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_Procedure_7">Experimental Procedure</SPAN></H4><P>First attempt
</P><P>Zepeda searched in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for an appropriate inverter which is a repressor followed by its binding site. We chose an inverter because it is going to be constitutively repressing anything downstream of it, but when it gets transcriptionally repressed (by LovTAP), whatever is downstream of it is going to be activated. 
</P><P>We chose the cI inverter from Lambda phage (BBa_Q04510) and proceeded to extract it from the 2009 kit plate 1, Zepeda transformed it by heat shock, extracted plasmid and digested it with EcoRI and PstI. 
</P><P>When checking the digestions on an agarose gel, the 1kb band expected from the cI inverter was absent or very thin, so He performed a PCR using the prefix and suffix as primers. 
The PCR came out very well with the expected size. As the double digestions were good enough to ligate, we hypothesize that not all plasmids had the inverter that is why it looks very weak on the digestions, but comes out very well in the PCR. 
</P><P>Zepeda did more PCRs for the cI inverter using RTTH polymerase (hot start), purified them and digested with EcoRI and PstI in order to ligate them to GFP. 
</P><P>In order to introduce the GFP with the new RBS he digested the GPF with SpeI/PstI and plasmid pSB1T3 with XbaI/PstI then he ligate them. 
</P><P>He tried several times to ligate the cI inverter to the GFP-PCR with new RBS in the plasmid pSB1T3 with no success. 
As non of the attempts to ligate the 2009 cI inverter PCR were  successful and the digestions were doubtful, he decided to extract the cI inverter from the 2010 kit plate. 
</P><P>After the transformation, plasmid extraction and double digestion with EcoRI/PstI he noticed there was something wrong with the plasmid because the in the gel there were always more that the two bands expected, so he extracted the inverter by PCR, digested it with EcoRI/PstI and cloned it into the commercial vector pBluescript II KS + hoping it would work for the ligations. 
</P><P>It was successfully cloned in the new vector so he proceeded to ligate it with the GFP (BBa_E0240) into the pSB1T3, then  he extracted plasmid and double digested it with EcoRI/PstI, in the gel we can see the two bands expected one for the ligation product about 1900 bp and the other for about 2500 bp corresponding to the plasmid, ergo it seems that it came out well. The only problem is that it doesn’t seem to glow when exposed to UV light, but it should as the cI repressor protein is not being transcribed.

Qualitative approach
TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). For each co transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from  a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~15hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 250rpm in dark conditions. Then, 1 ml of broth was taken and transferred into 5 ml of fresh LB medium with antibiotics. The cultures were grown for approximately 13 hours under the previous conditions but some were exposed to blue light (470nm) while others were maintained in dark. Finally, the cultures were spun down and compared as follows: the RFP pellets obtained under blue-light versus dark condition, and wild type samples versus mutant samples.

</P><P>TrpR mutant and wild type cells were co transformed using 5 µL of each plasmid (trpL-RFP in pSB1C3/ pSB1A2 and each LovTAP construction in pSB3K3). As controls RFP constitutively expressed under J23102 promoter was used and wild type cells transformed just with trpL-RFP. For each transformation one  tube containing 5 ml of  LB medium with Kanamicyn and chloramphenicol or Kanamicyn and ampicillin, was inoculated from  a single colony of DH5α. Cultures were grown  overnight (~14hrs) at 37°C with spinning at 100rpm under blue light (470nm) conditions. Then cultures were diluted 1:1000 into 5ml of fresh LB media with antibiotics. These were grown for approximately 4.5 hours under the previous conditions under blue light (470nm). After this step the OD600 was measured from each culture.  Based on this OD measurement, the cultures were diluted to the same OD (0.15) in 5 ml of LB fresh media. Then three 200 µL aliquots from each culture were transferred into a flat-bottomed 96 well plate. 
</P><P>Samples were loaded in the plate as is shown in the next picture: 	
</P><P>An initial measurement of OD600 and fluorescence (530/25 nm excitation filter, 590/35 nm emission filter) by triplicate was done. Using the light emission device to irradiate the incubator, the plate was maintained during 17 hrs at 37°C with spinning at 35rpm inside the incubator but with a mask in the samples selected for the dark conditions.  Then, a second measurement of OD600 and fluorescence was done. Initial data with the second measurement were compared.  Background absorbance and fluorescence were determined by measuring wells containing only media, and the values obtained were used to normalize the other samples.

</P><P>For the experiment, cells were incubated overnight in M9 medium with glycerol (0.4%) as carbon source, in the morning OD600 was measured and cells diluted to 0.07 nm. After dilutions, we started irradiation with blue leds. Temperature is a very important factor in the function of the YcgF/YcgE system; it is reported that at 25ºC the ratio between the YcgE repressor and YcgF activator allows a good repression unless there is blue ligh irradiation, so we incubated cells with this promoter at 25ºC. Cells with the constitutive promoter BBa_J23101 were also incubated overnight at 37ºC.

</P><P>In general he did not have  many problems getting luxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri’s genome by PCR. <B>We sent luxAB from V. fischeri to Edinburgh as a PCR product</B>.
</P><P>The PCR reaction yielded a DNA band of the expected size of luxAB genes which are supposed to be (~2100bp).Besides there were resulting unspecific amplification products.  
</P><P>Once Augusto got luxAB genes from genomic DNA he purified PCR product with High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit by Roche and then he tried to ligate them with different plasmids, all of them containing constitutive promoters. The general protocol followed is this:
</P><P>1.Digestion of the plasmid with SpeI and PstI in order to ligate luxAB genes in front of the promoter carried by the plasmid.
</P><P>2.Digestion of the PCR product with XbaI and PstI.
</P><P>3.Dephosphatation of plasmids to avoid re-annealing and false positives after bacterial transformation.
</P><P>4.Overnight ligation
</P><P>5.Bacterial transformation with the ligation left overnight and culturing on selective media.
</P><P>The different plasmids that he used as vectors are the following ones:
•J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23101
•J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23102
•J61002 carrying constitutive promoter J23106
</P><P>He also used plasmids without constitutive promoters (of course these plasmids were digested with EcoRI and PstI or SpeI) such as:
</P><P>•pSB1C3 
•pSB1T3
•BBa_I51020
</P><P>Because none of these ligations were successful we thought that it could be due to issues with our plasmids from the iGEM DNA submission so we decided to ligate luxAB genes into a commercial plasmid, Augusto tried the ligation with 
</P><P>•pBluescript II KS (+/-) restricted with EcoRI and PstI
</P><P>However none of these ligations were successful, whenever they resulted in probable colonies, an analysis revealed they were always false positives, it seemed that some other smaller alternative PCR product was being ligated into these vectors.
</P><P>Because we thought there was some smaller unspecific PCR product with bigger chances of ligation than actual luxAB genes, we decided to make a PCR and then a gel band purification; the resulting purification would contain only luxAB genes so it should avoid the ligation of unspecific products to the vector, nonetheless these ligations never resulted so at the end <B>we were unable to get luxAB genes from Vibrio fischeri</B>.
</P><P>(It is worthy to note that these ligations were carried out several times by several people, some of them with a lot of experience and it never was successful).
</P><P><B>Our collaborator team from Cambridge University sent us a plasmid carrying the whole operon lux</B> (except the regulatory genes) this is luxA, luxB, luxC, luxD, luxE, which means that an E.coli transformated with this plasmid would glow without the need of any exogenous input because it has the genes coding for the bacterial luciferase as well as the genes coding for the enzymes needed for substrate synthesis.
This operon was under control of PBAD promoter depending on arabinose to be active so the bacteria transformated with this plasmid had to be grown on arabinose medium in order to observe the blue glowing phenotype.

The cotransformation was successful, but we have not been able to see the yellow glowing phenotype yet, it is still green-blue. We have to improve the experimental conditions, particulary the temperature because LuxY is not functional above 20°C.

The cotransformation was successful, but we have not been able to see the blue shifting glowing phenotype yet, it is still green-blue. Its possible that the wavelenght shift is being correctly done but with our vision we can't see the change, so that we have to use a sensible measuremente device to detect it. We tried with an spectrophotometer but it doesn't detect any RLU (relative light emmission unit), even the bioluminescence is visible to naked eye in the dark room. We hope to use a CCD camera for this measurment.</B></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Journal">Journal</SPAN></H2><P>These are our Reports. Each link contains the report of a the given person.
