The Whole Team
We are a bunch of college students with nothing to do but play with expensive waters.
The link on the names will take you to our Work pages (usually Open Wet Ware based). Most of our work on this iGEM is documented there.
Advisors
Dr. Miguel Ángel Ramírez Romero:     Grows impossible things in wetlab
Dr. Juan Carlos Martínez García : Writes wonder models
Dr. Christopher Wood : Knows how to play with light
Dr. Karla Cedano Villavicencio : Advisor on Socials, Human Practices, Budget & Related

Where we're from
The Republic
We hail from many places of the Mexican Republic, such as:

Genomics
Though we do not come from the same hometown, we are all attending the same University. That is the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Campus Morelos, in the city of Cuernavaca. Most of us met here when we entered the Genomic Sciences Program. As such, we are a tight bunch.
The above picture is the Main Entrance to the Lecture Halls. The hammock to the left is quite comfortable in hot days ;)

iGEM
iGEM is the International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition, held each year at MIT and organized with support of the Parts Registry. See more here .
Synthetic Biology
This is defined as attempting to manipulate living objects as if they were man-made machines, specifically in terms of genetic engineering. See more here .
Genomics
We are students on the Genomic Sciences program at the Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, campus Morelos. See more here .
