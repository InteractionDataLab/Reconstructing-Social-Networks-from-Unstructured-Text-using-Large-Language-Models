Bootcamp
In order to prepare for the project, the UIUC Software team made sure everyone was on the same page during our first week of summer.
Task List
Learn Django - Web Development
Learn how to utilize COBRA for cell modeling
Connect to the team SVN
Understand the IMPtools code (written in Python)
Assign responsibilities for each member
Results
Bootcamp turned out to be a big success. All of the tasks were in some way or another, completed. It turned out that after responsibilities were assigned, some tasks were unnecessary for some, and more important for others. By the end of the week of bootcamp, we had a very effective team with everyone working hard to accomplish the team's goals.
