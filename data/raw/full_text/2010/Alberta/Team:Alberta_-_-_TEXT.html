GENOMIKON: An Educational Toolkit for Rapid Genetic Construction
Building DNA is too hard. It has to be cheaper, faster, and easier, so that everyone can do it.  So... we've created an inexpensive, self-contained educational kit called GENOMIKON - everything you need to build, test and operate genetic circuits and metabolic pathways.  It comes with an online lab manual, notebook, and experiment software. It can be used by professionals as well.

Achievements
Optimized BioBytes 2.0 assembly method.
Created an educational, self-containing tool kit for the high school classroom.
Developed online, educational software tools.
Demonstrated that high school students can successfully assemble plasmids using our kit.
THE SOFTWARE
Learn about synthetic biology and apply your knowledge by creating and sharing your own experiments.
BioBytes 2.0
We have improved and adapted the BioBytes assembly method, created by the 2009 Alberta iGEM team, into an educational tool kit that is self-containing and affordable so that high school students can use it.
The kit
Everything you need to construct a functional plasmid... in one afternoon!
THANK YOU TO OUR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTORS
