Plasmid Miniprep
Reagents:
Overnight culture
Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit
Procedure:
Transfer 1.5ml of culture to Eppendorf.
Spin down at 13 000 rpm.
Discard supernatant and follow procedure on p. 22 of QIAprep Miniprep Handbook .
Determine concentration of purified plasmid with nanodrop.
Notes:
Low speed pellet is easier to resuspend.
To resuspend, take an empty micro centrifuge rack and rub the tube quickly over the apparatus and vortex.
Step 2 in Qiagen, the alkaline lysis with buffer P2, should be brief to avoid damaging DNA.
