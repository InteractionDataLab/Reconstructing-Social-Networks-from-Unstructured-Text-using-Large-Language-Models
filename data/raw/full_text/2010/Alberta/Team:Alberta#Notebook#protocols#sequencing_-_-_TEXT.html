Fluorescent Sequencing Reaction
Procedure:
In a 0.2ml PCR tube, add:
Template
5.0ul (200 ng/ul)
VF primer
1.0ul
Dilute buffer
2.5ul
BD sequence mix
1.5ul
Mix well.
Select program 'seq-dye' on PTC 200 thermal cycler.
Run program. It will take about 2 hours.
Remove tube from PCR machine and transfer 10ul rxn mix to 1.5ml Eppendorf tube. Add:
Blue NaOAc/EDTA
1.5ul
95% ethanol
40ul
Let sit on ice 15 minutes.
Centrifuge 10 minutes at max speed.
Should see a small blue dot at bottom of tube.
Discard supernatant.
Wash pellet with 500ul of 70% ethanol.
Discard supernatant and spin briefly to bring down the residual liquid. Draw liquid off with a P10 pipette tip.
Do not disturb the pellet.
Air dry for 10 minutes.
Place in -20oC freezer to be delivered to MBSU 4th floor microbiology M534. Reactions delivered before 2pm will normally be returned the next day.
