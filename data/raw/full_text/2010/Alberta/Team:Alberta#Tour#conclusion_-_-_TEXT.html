GENOMIKON: The Kit
Conclusion
Team Alberta's GENOMIKON project makes synthetic biology easier, faster, and more accessible than ever. As you have seen, the BioBytes 2.0 assembly method, the GENOMIKON kit and GENOMIKON.ca work together to allow students to have the  most enriched learning experience.  This project shares synthetic biology with the public while pushing the development of synthetic biology in new and exciting directions.
