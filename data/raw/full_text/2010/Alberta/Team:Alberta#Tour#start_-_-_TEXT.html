GENOMIKON: An educational toolkit for rapid genomic construction
The heart of GENOMIKON, the DNA parts.
GENOMIKON
The 2010 Alberta iGEM team has created an educational toolkit that has the potential to revolutionize the high school biology classroom. The GENOMIKON kit applies the principles of our newly refined genomic assembly method, BioBytes 2.0 to allow students to both design and assemble a plasmid in one afternoon. It is accompanied by our comprehensive online learning resource, GENOMIKON.ca. Using the GENOMIKON kit and online lab manual, students will be able to learn the fundamentals of synthetic biology and apply them in unique, hands-on experiments.
This tour outlines some of our accomplishments. We introduce the foundational technology of the kit, the components of the kit, and the supporting software.
