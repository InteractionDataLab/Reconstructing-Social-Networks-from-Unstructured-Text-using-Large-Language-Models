PCR
Procedure:
Before you start:
KEEP EVERYTHING ON ICE. Put Taq back into freezer as soon as you`re done with it. DON`T put back dNTP tubes.
Reserve a thermocycler and check what size of tubes it takes.
Making a master mix conserves expensive reagents, so try to always use one.
You may have to do dilutions of your reagents in order to make them usable for PCR (ex: primers, plasmid DNA...)
DON'T PUT PRIMERS OR TEMPLATE INTO THE MASTER MIX. ADD POLYMERASE TO THE MASTER MIX LAST (after your other tubes already have template DNA and primers in them)!
To add into a tube:
PCR buffer
5ul
10uM dNTPs
1ul
50uM MgCl2
2ul
Forward primer
2.5ul
Reverse primer

MilliQ water
35.5ul
TOTAL
50ul
