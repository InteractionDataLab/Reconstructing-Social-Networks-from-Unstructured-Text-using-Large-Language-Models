Will start with a polyA tail Anchor oligo which will connect to a polyT tail which is bound to the bead.  The anchor will consist of a primer region, a BsaI cut site, a buffer region, and finally, an A prime or B prime end.  A byte with an appropriate end can be added to this anchor, and another byte can be added onto that, etc...  The last thing to be added to the construct is a Terminator byte consisting of a buffer region, BsaI cut site, primer region and a polyT tail.  This second primer sequence must be as uncomplimentary as possible to the anchor's primer site so as to minimize primers binding to each other when PCRing the assembled construct.  The primers melting point must be around 65 C.  After the construct is assembled on the bead, it is heated off and the polyA tail of the anchor binds to the polyT tail of the terminator and a plasmid is born. </P><P>We will purchase NEB oligo dT magnetic and cellulose beads which have a polyT tail (5' to 3') 25 nucleotides long.  They are meant for mRNA isolation, but should work fine for our purposes.  Used the IDT Analyzer software to determine what length of polyA tail is required for our anchor to have a melting temperature of 30 degrees Celsius (decided to change this melting temp later).  This melting temp is sensitive to Na+ and Mg++ concentrations, so referred to ligase buffer and elution buffer for these concentrations.</P><P>The BsaI A end should look like this:</P><P>Designed an anchor with a polyA10 tail with a primer (Tm=65.1 C) region and the BsaI cut site with an A' end (ACCC).</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="26-05-2010">26-05-2010</SPAN></H2><P>Designed new anchors, ordered oligos.

ssDNA is ~330 grams/(mol*bp)

moles = [concentration X volume] / [(330grams/mol X bp) X length]

0.06g beads = 0.0599g; therefore, 0.06g can isolated 0.1 to 1 mg RNA.</P><P>Calculated the minimal and maximal rpm for 2000 to 5000g of beads using the following formula:
a = 4(pi)<SUP>2</SUP>r(rpm)<SUP>2</SUP> / 60<SUP>2</SUP>

So, when centrifuging the beads, the rpm must stay between 4700 to 7400 rpm. In the modified mRNA procedure, the centrifuge is set to 5500 rpm.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="10-06-2010">10-06-2010</SPAN></H2><P>Attempted to find binding capacity (in moles per mass of beads) by binding known masses of anchor to the bead, following the protocol <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=08-06-10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="08-06-10 (page does not exist)">08-06-10</A>, then quantifying the mass of DNA recovered off of the beads after eluting the DNA off of the bead.  The cellulose beads settle very quickly without agitation.  Measuring precise volumes of the beads was done by pipetting the cellulose bead slush into pcr tubes that were marked at 16 uL.  To quantify the masses of DNA that: did not bind to the bead, came through the washes, and were eluted from the beads, the nano-drop 1000 spectrophotometer was used.  The results showed that most of the anchor did not bind to the cellulose beads, and a very small amount of DNA was bound and eluted off of the beads.  Possible reasons could be that the anchor was not binding, or there was too much anchor relative to the beads.  A gel was also done.  It showed that there was a lot of anchor that did not bind, and no anchor band was visible in the elution lane (which was expected based on the nanodrop reading).
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="11-06-2010">11-06-2010</SPAN></H2><P>Repeated yesterday's experiment, but with a much larger amount of DNA.  1500 ng of anchor DNA to 16 uL of cellulose bead slush.  There were no significant nanodrop readings except for the measurement of the amount of DNA that did not bind to the beads.  Based on the nanodrop reading, over 1100 ng of DNA did not bind to the beads.  The rest must have been washed away in the wash.  Perhaps the melting temperature of the polyA12 tail is too low.  We'll order one with a polyA18 tail and repeat the experiment.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="14-06-2010">14-06-2010</SPAN></H2><P>-Attempted to bind various masses of anchor to 16 uL of beads.  Used 500, 1000, and 1500 ng of beads.  Followed the modified mRNA isolation protocol created last week <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=08-06-10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="08-06-10 (page does not exist)">08-06-10</A>.  Based on nanodrop readings, we recovered 560 ng from 1500 ng of initial DNA,  63 ng of 1000 ng of initial DNA, and 244 ng of 500 ng of DNA.  Strange result of the 1000 ng of DNA, but a good sign that something appears to be binding to the cellulose beads.
-To attempt to find the amount of anchor that will saturate the beads binding capacity, we used 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 ug of anchor and attempted to bind them to 16 uL of cellulose beads.  Nanodrop readings multiplied by volume gave 600, 763, 1102, and 1730 ng of DNA not binding to the bead.  What bound to the bead was 248, 1935, 4032, and 2470 ng of DNA.  Obviously, something has caused the DNA readings to imply that more DNA was recovered than was put in initially.  Later we found out that the readings are extremely sensitive to the small amount of residual washing solutions left over, causing the blanking process of the nanodrop to not accurately represent what solution the DNA was in.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="15-06-2010">15-06-2010</SPAN></H2><P>-The cellulose mRNA isolation kit came with a small amount of columns enough for only 8 trials.  More were ordered.  Will use magnetic beads in the meantime.
-Created modified magnetic bead protocol based on the mRNA isolation protocol <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=08-06-10&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="08-06-10 (page does not exist)">08-06-10</A>.  Enough beads present in kit for 100 trials.
-Magnetic Bead Trial #1: attempt to bind 100, 500, 1000, and 2500 ng of polyA12 anchor to 20 uL of polyT magnetic beads.  Followed the modified magnetic bead protocol and eluted in 50 uL of elution buffer in a 50 C water bath.  When nanodropping, apply magnet in case a small amount of magnetic particles were caught in the elution.  Results: 80, 250, 305, and 460 ng of DNA were recovered from the beads after applying 100, 500, 1000 and 2500 ng of DNA initially.  The magnetic beads appear to be more efficient at lower masses of DNA being bound.  This appears encouraging, however, the nanodrop readings multiplied by the solution volume for the amount of DNA that did not bind initially were 335, 785, 970, and 2140 ng of DNA.  The amount of DNA that did not bind and the amount that did does not add up to the amount of DNA added.  This could be due to the residual solution left behind after washes.  Will redo the experiment with less concentrated anchor and careful washes.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="16-06-2010">16-06-2010</SPAN></H2><P>-Magnetic Bead Trial 2: attempt to bind 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 ng of anchor to 20 uL of beads.  The mass of the DNA which didn't bind exceeded the mass of what was intitially mixed with the beads.  This is obviously an error in measurement (caused by what!).  The amount of DNA recovered was 0, 90, 70, and 250 ng of DNA.  Looks like nothing bound to the beads.  Possible cause of no DNA binding to bead: very low concentration of anchor meant a large reaction volume which would lead to a higher reaction time.  Next time, use higher concentration anchor and increase binding time to an hour rather than 15 minutes (the mRNA isolation procedure calls for only 10 minutes).
