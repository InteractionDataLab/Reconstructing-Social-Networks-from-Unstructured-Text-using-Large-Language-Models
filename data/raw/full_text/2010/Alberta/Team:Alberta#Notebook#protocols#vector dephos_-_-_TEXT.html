Vector Dephosphorylation
Reagents:
Antarctic phosphatase
10x Antarctic phosphatase buffer
Procedure:
Add 1/10 volume of 10x antarctic phosphatase reaction buffer to 1-5ug of DNA cut with any restriction endonuclease in any buffer.
Add 1ul of Antarctic phosphatase and mix.
Incubate 5 minutes at 37oC.
Heat inactivate for 5 minutes at 65oC.
Proceed with ligation.
Notes:
Vector dephosphorylation can be useful in cutting transformation background, but it is very harsh.
It chews off 5' phosphates, but it also keeps chewing on the DNA ends, reducing total transformation efficiency.
Try without dephosphorylation first, and minimize exposure to phosphatase if you must resort to using it.
