Testing Parts
08-06-2010
To test the function of E.coli smell variant experiments for our kit, BBa_J45120 (Wintergreen) and BBa_J45200 (Banana) from the MIT 2006 BioBrick Registry were transformed in DH5α cells.
11-06-2010
We experimented with L'Oreal skin toner LB media to see if BBa_J45120 plasmids from 08-06-2010 would produce a wintergreen odor. We incubated cultures in L'Oreal LB in a 5%, 10% and 15% concentration.
12-06-2010
L'Oreal LB cultures from 11-06-2010 had little growth success. Two of the 5% L'Oreal LB cultures grew.
