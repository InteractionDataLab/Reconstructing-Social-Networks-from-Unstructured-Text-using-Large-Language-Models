I expect this year to be as enjoyable as the last and even more successful. My participation in iGEM has exposed me to concepts and experiences that I could not have received elsewhere in my undergrad experience. My interests include brain machine interfacing, computational intelligence, haptic teleoperation, and of course, synthetic biology. I am now pursuing my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. iGEM has proven to be a fascinating and rewarding experience and I am looking forward to the competition.

dodge ball. I see iGEM as an extraordinary opportunity for me to be exposed to real life research, in which my knowledge of molecular genetics will be challenged, and will help me further my understanding of Synthetic Biology. &quot;Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin&quot; - Charles Darwin

My goal is to get into graduate
studies in either Microbiology and Biotechnology or Microbiology and Genetics. Thus, I believe iGEM is a fascinating opportunity to learn about Synthetic Biology, to gain experience conducting experiments in a laboratory and work with various people with different educational backgrounds. When I am not slaving away with studying and schoolwork, my hobbies include: producing digital art on Photoshop, listening to music, playing the piano and chasing my ankle-biting dog when he slips past the backyard fence because he plans to wreak havoc around the neighborhood.

I really hope to see synthetic biology open up the intricate machine-like world inside cells to engineering applications.  For now, help from the biofuels industry seems to be a safe bet, as long as oil prices stay high.  Iâm also a fan of rally racing, DnB, military aviation, eastern and western philosophy/metaphysics and you can find me on Starcraft 2 occasionally.

I aim to contribute my knowledge and abilities in this field to the U of A iGEM team.

My outside interests are: sport (soccer, rock climbing), music (playing kit drums, listening to nearly all genres), and languages (fluent in one, nearly-functional in three more, and can say at least âthank youâ in about 30 others). I sincerely hope to help ensure that the U of A team continues to prove itself as an organization in the vanguard of scientific innovation. I also love to laughâ¦ha ha.

I am constantly in awe of the creative power of evolution and the astounding diversity of the life on our little planet.  What better way to learn more about the the inner workings of the living things around us than to tinker with them and reassemble their parts in new and strange (hopefully useful)
ways? I very excited to be a part of the iGEM team and participate in the development of new tools and methods in the field of Synthetic Biology.  I hope to continue researching in this area beyond my undergrad, and ultimately use these tools for the creation of microbial robots.

In addition to iGEM, my other research experiences have included synbio and biophysics projects. iGEM has proven to be an amazing eye opener for the potential of biological engineering. I hope to continue to be involved with some aspect of this field in the future.

My addiction involves following design &amp; art blogs and reading design books. I spend my free time repurposing furniture, doodling, decorating cupcakes and listening to music. iGEM has given me a great opportunity to apply my design knowledge to something real and practical.

More recently his interests have tended towards the possibility of constructing synthetic biological devices that perform useful functions.
</P><P>As Synthetic Biology theme leader of the Bioconversions network, his current efforts are directed toward the creation of microbial systems with the capacity to produce high value chemical feed stocks from provincially available sources of biomass.
</P><P>He continues to be a strong advocate for innovative science. He has served on the boards of Genome Prairie, the Alberta Network for Proteomic Innovation and has played a major role in bringing new technologies to the university through two multi-million dollar investments from the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
