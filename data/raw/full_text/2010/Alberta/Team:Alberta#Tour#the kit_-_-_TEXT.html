Bringing Synthetic Biology to the High School Classroom
BioBytes 2.0 is the basis of GENOMIKON, an educational toolkit for the high school classroom. The kit contains all the equipment, media, reagents and BioBytes needed for use in a high school laboratory.
The GENOMIKON kit overcomes a number of design challenges. Specifically, the high school laboratory lacks sterilization equipment and other traditional laboratory equipment. The issue of sterility is solved by pre-sterilizing all parts of the kit. The need for expensive laboratory equipment has been eliminated by optimization of the BioBytes 2.0 assembly method. A hotplate is the only supplementary piece of equipment required to complete all the experiments you find at GENOMIKON.ca .
