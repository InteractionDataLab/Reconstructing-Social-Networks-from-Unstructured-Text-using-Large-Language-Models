Restriction Digest
Reagents:
Restriction enzyme buffer
Buffer information can be found at www.NEB.com using the NEBtools.
Restriction enzymes
MilliQ water
DNA to be digested
Procedure:
Select a restriction enzyme buffer that is appropriate for BOTH of the enzymes you are using. See information sheets at front of lab for correct buffer and concentration.
The total volume of all enzymes in the reaction should be less than 10% of the final reaction volume. Enzymes usually are supplied at 10U/ul and 1ul will be more than enough for our digests.
Add components in the following order:
Water
Buffer
Bovine Serum Albumin-BSA (if needed)
DNA
Enzyme I
Enzyme II
An example of a typical 25 ul reaction would be:
MilliQ water
15.5 ul
10x NEBuffer
2.5 ul
DNA (200 ng/ul)
5.0 ul
XbaI
1.0 ul
PstI
1.0 ul
Incubate at 37oC for one hour (longer is okay too).
Notes:
FastDigest (by Fermentas) enzymes use a single uniform buffer, and claim to work in 5 minutes.
