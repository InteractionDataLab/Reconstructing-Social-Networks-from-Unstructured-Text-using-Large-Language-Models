From 2010.igem.org
This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.

Project Summary
Genomikon: an Educational Toolkit for the Rapid Assembly of Plasmids
Synthetic biology is a new and expanding field that has potential applications in every aspect of society.  Today, synthetic biology is underused because it is expensive and slow.  The University of Alberta is developing a method of plasmid assembly that is modular, rapid, and inexpensive. We are in process of designing an educational kit, Genomikon, which will enable anyone to construct a plasmid without special equipment. We will also provide a comprehensive lab manual to accomodate those new to the field.
To demonstrate the accessibility of our Genomikon toolkit, we will implement it in a high school laboratory setting. Genetic parts will be adapted into a system called BioBytes. This system will allow students to rationally create functional plasmids. The kit’s flexiblity will accomodate both predesigned experiments and new creative expressions. We believe that our kit could revolutionize science education. Our project not only seeks to optimize current procedures of synthetic biology but will also expose a new generation of students to this exciting field.
