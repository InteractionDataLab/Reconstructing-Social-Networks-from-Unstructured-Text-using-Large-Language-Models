Our Achievements
The Team Alberta 2010 iGEM team has made numerous key achievements.
We completed the Gold Medal requirements for iGEM.
We continued to develop the BioBytes assembly method developed by last year’s team.
We successfully assembled an 8-Byte long construct using the BioBytes 2.0 assembly method.
We created a model to further understand the efficiency of BioBytes 2.0.
We created the GENOMIKON kit, which contains everything needed for genomic assembly in a high school laboratory. We have created a prototype of this kit.
We developed a comprehensive online lab manual, GENOMIKON.ca, to accompany the GENOMIKON kit. It has such features as pre-designed experiments, encyclopedia articles, an integrated glossary, and an interactive plasmid design tool.
We researched and developed a distribution plan, investigating the potential of bringing the GENOMIKON kit into high school classrooms.
High school students were able to successfully create functional plasmids using the GENOMIKON kit.
