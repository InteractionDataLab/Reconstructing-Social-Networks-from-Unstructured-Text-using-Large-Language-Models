Base Plasmids v.1
Our original base plasmids contain a Kanamycin resistance cassette (p1003) bracketed by BsaI or BfuAI or BbsI cut sites.  If cut with either BsaI or BfuAI or BbsI, the Kanamycin cassette is release with sticky ends characteristic of an A or a B BioByte.
May 10, 2010 PCRed p1003 (Kanamycin cassette)with primers PrA_p1003+ and PrB'_p1003-
May 10, 2010 PCRed p1003 (Kanamycin cassette)with primers PrB_p1003+ and PrA'_p1003-
May 19, 2010 Digested pSB1C3 with Not1
May 19, 2010 Digested PCR products of p1003 (Kanamycin cassette) Not1
May 25, 2010 Ligated PCR products of p1003 (Kanamycin cassette) and pSB1C3
Testing Parts
Before we were able to test parts we created 2 base testing plasmids (vector 01 and vector 02).  Vector 01 is designed to test Open Reading Frame parts, or parts that code for proteins.   The part is flanked by a promoter and the start codon on one side and a stop codon and terminator on the other.  Vector 02 is designed to test linker parts, or parts that control the expression of the Open Reading Frame parts they are next two.  In Vector 02 the part is flanked by two distinct reporter genes, that by comparing the relative expression of the 2 reporter genes we can determine the behavior of the linking part.

Restriction Digest with EcoRI Protocol to determine plasmid size:
pSB1A3 with chlor or tet insert                               1ul
Fast Digest EcoRI                                             1ul
10X Fast Digest Buffer                                        2ul
MilliQ H2O                                                    16ul
Total                                                         20ul
Incubated at 37C for 5 mins.
Gel Electrophoresis
Lanes 2-5 are pSB1A3 plasmid with tet AB insert. Lanes 6-13 are pSB1A3 plasmid with chlor AB insert. All plasmids were digested with EcoRI. All but the products of lanes 3,6,10,11,12 were correct. 1 out of the 4 tet in pSB1A3 tubes cut incorrectly and was discarded, 4 out of the 7 chlor in pSB1A3 tubes cut incorrectly and was discarded.

Double Digest of chlor, kan and tet in PSB1A3 and amp is pSB1C3 with Xba and PstI protocol
plasmid with antibiotic part    1ul
10X NEBuffer 3                  1ul
MilliQ H20                      5ul
XbaI                            1ul
PstI                            1ul
10X BSA                         1ul
Total                           10ul
Incubated at 37C for 1 hour.
Gel Electrophoresis
Digests of antibiotic AB fragments with XbaI and PstI. Lanes 2-3 are kanamycin AB, lanes 4-6 are chloramphenicol AB, lanes 7-9 are tetracycline AB, lanes 10-12 are ampicillin AB. All of the plasmids cut correctly except for one of the amp in pSB1C3, which was discarded

Antibiotic parts are now stored in the DNA box according to the BioBytes registry.
Glycerol stocks were made of overnights from chlor, tet, and kan in PSB1A3 plates.
