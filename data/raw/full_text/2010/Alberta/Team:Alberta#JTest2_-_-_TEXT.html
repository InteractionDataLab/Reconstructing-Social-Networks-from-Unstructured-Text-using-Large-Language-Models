Project Overview
Genomikon: an Educational Toolkit for the Rapid Assembly of Plasmids
Synthetic biology is a new and expanding field that has potential applications in every aspect of society.  Today, synthetic biology is underused because it is expensive and slow.  The University of Alberta is developing a method of plasmid assembly that is modular, rapid, and inexpensive. We are in process of designing an educational kit, Genomikon, which will enable anyone to construct a plasmid without special equipment. We will also provide a comprehensive lab manual to accomodate those new to the field.
To demonstrate the accessibility of our Genomikon toolkit, we will implement it in a high school laboratory setting. Genetic parts will be adapted into a system called BioBytes. This system will allow students to rationally create functional plasmids. The kit’s flexiblity will accomodate both predesigned experiments and new creative expressions. We believe that our kit could revolutionize science education. Our project not only seeks to optimize current procedures of synthetic biology but will also expose a new generation of students to this exciting field.

Synthetic Biology Guide
Synthetic Biology is a field that involves the design and construction of artificial biological systems and functions using the methodologies of both science and engineering. This new expanding field is applied to studying biological systems found in nature by building an artificial construct using the current knowledge of the system, and engineer biological systems to be used as tools in biotechnology.
Synthetic Biology is a new approach to genetic engineering modelled after the efficient style of other engineering disciplines to allow greater productivity and complexity. Synthesis and Reading of DNA can now be done in and automated fashion, ever faster and cheaper in rough agreement with Moore’s law. DNA designers can prepare and order parts using standards of compatibility, and can model complex gene networks built from simple parts and devices.
