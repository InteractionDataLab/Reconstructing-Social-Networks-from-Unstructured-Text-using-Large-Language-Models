Visit From DiscoverElle
In the middle of the summer, we were visited by a group of twelve middle school girls from the DiscoverElle science and engineering day camp.  DiscoverElle is an all-girls day camp provided by the University of Alberta's DiscoverE program; it promotes interest in science and engineering among young women.  A team member gave the girls a tour of the lab and lectured on synthetic biology, iGEM and the GENOMIKON project.  They even had the opportunity to set up and run gels used the development of GENOMIKON.  We enjoyed having the opportunity to share our knowledge of and passion for synthetic biology with them.  After all, these are the people who will participate in iGEM 2020!
