PCRing Antibiotic Resistance Markers
May 25, 2010
PCRed the antibiotic resistance marker biobytes (Ampicillin, Tetracycline and Chlormaphenicol) that are analogous to the kanamycin PCR fragements.
Ampicillin:
Primers = Pr.A.SB4A5.Apr+ and Pr.B. SB4A5.Apr -
Template = pSB4A5
Chloramphenical:
Primers = Pr. A. SB4C5.Chr + and Pr.B.SB4A5.Chr -
Template = pSB4C5
Tetracycline:
Primers = Pr.A.SB3T5.Tr+ and Pr.B.PSB3T5.Tr -
Template = pSB3T5

The Wintergreen Experiment and the Photobacterial Construct

Testing of the photobacterial construct:
We tried to see if the photobacterial construct could be created using without using X-gal cleavage as a basis for visualization of the colonies.
June 28, 2010 - Preparation of biobricks
July 22, 2010 - Creation of promoter and inducer parts
July 26, 2010 - Final biobrick assembly
July 28, 2010 - Creation of system with carotenoid marker
August 5, 2010 - Complete preparation with light during growth
AB chlor and tet parts
Strategy:
Digest both AB kan PCR product and pSB1A3 with NotI, and ligate. Then, cut chlor and tet AB PCR products with BsaI and cut out the kan from the plasmid using BsaI, and ligate chlor or tet into it.
June 30, 2010:
Digested PCR product kan AB and pSB1A3 with NotI. Ligated the kan and pSB1A3 together.
July 5, 2010:
Transformed from the ligation of kan and pSB1A3.
July 6, 2010:
White colonies. Set up overnights.
July 7, 2010:
Made minipreps from the overnights and digested them with XbaI and PstI to check for proper orientation.  Digested those in correct orientation with BsaI to remove kan. Digested PCR product chlor AB and tet AB with BsaI. Ligated chlor and tet separately with the PSB1A3 backbone.
July 8, 2010:
Transformed from ligations of chlor and tet AB with pSB1A3 backbone.
July 9, 2010:
White colonies. Set up overnights.
July 10, 2010:
Minipreps were done and were digested with EcoRI to test for size.
July 13, 2010:
Digested kan, tet and amp AB’s with BsaIHF.
July 14, 2010:
Digested kan, chlor, tet and amp AB’s with XbaI and PstI.
July 20, 2010:
Glycerol stocks were made of chlor and tet AB.
August 9, 2010:
Sequenced AB amp (tube A) (from Anh’s previous work), tet (tube B1) and chlor (tube D1). All look good.
August 13, 2010:
Transformed from the successful, sequenced tubes.
August 16-17, 2010:
White colonies. Made maxipreps, after inoculation from transformed plates, of AB chlor (pC.s.A.005) and amp (pC.s.A.003)
August 18, 2010:
Digested the maxipreps with BsaI.
Production of BioByte Parts:
Parts are created by PCR, digested with BsaI, and put into the parts plasmids as demonstrated by mWasabi.
Aug 12,2010 PCR amplification of CrtE,CrtB,CrtI, CrtY, CrtZ, VioA, VioB, VioC, VioD, VioE, araC, lacI, tetR, CI
Amplification failed
Aug 13,2010  Troubleshoot amplification and PCR CrtY with primers leaving a BsaI cut site leaving characteristic A BioByte Overhangs
Aug 14, 2010 PCR CrtB, CrtE, CrtY, VioA, vioD vioE, AraC, lacI parts with primers leaving a BsaI cut site leaving characteristic A BioByte Overhangs
Aug 16, 2010 Digested all parts and BsaI Base Plasmids with BsaI, ligated together and transformed.
Aug 17, 2010 There were red and white colonies of all parts.
Aug 18, 2010 Digested Minipreps of colonies and expected band lengths were observed.
Parts were sequenced to confirm expected sequences:
Sept. 9-Oct. 9, 2010.  Made and confirmed sequences of eCFP and mRFP parts.

Chlor BA
First, we have to make a Bsa BA pSB1A3 backbone by digesting pSB1A3 with XbaI and PstI and inserting Bsa BA kan. Then, the kan is cut out with BsaI and chlor BA is placed in.
