Transformations
Reagents:
Competent DH5α cells (100uL per transformation)
up to 5uL of plasmid you want to transform
800uL of LB (non-contaminated) per transformation
Plate with correct antibiotics
Procedure:
Chill a box of pipette tips at -4oC and put your reaction tubes on ice.
Obtain DH5α cells from the –80oC freezer and thaw in palm. Store on ice for 10 minutes.
Use a chilled tip to transfer 100 ul of the DH5α cells into each tube. Set aside one tube as a control.
Pipet up to 5uL of the plasmid (up to 50ng per 100ul of competent cells, plasmid amount. Should not exceed 5% that of the competent cells) into each tube. Swirl.
Store on ice for 30 minutes.
Place tubes in incubator set to 42oC for EXACTLY 90 seconds.
Return the tubes to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 800uL of LB to each tube.
Incubate at 37oC for 45 minutes, ensure that the tube has at least 2ml capacity, to properly aerate the cells.
Spread cells on plate with appropriate antibiotic: plate between 50- 300ul each. Let dry.
Place plates inverted in incubator at 37oC for 12-16 hours.
