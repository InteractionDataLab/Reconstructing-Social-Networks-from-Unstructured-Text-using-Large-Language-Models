Resources
In Arabidopsis
Whole-genome study to determine Arabidopsis response to hypoxic stress [1] -- Jmason
Expression and evolution of functionally distinct haemoglobin genes in plants [2]
Also discusses growing and modifying Arabidopsis to test promoter regions for functionality -- Jmason
Arabidopsis mutants reveal multiple singlet oxygen signaling pathways involved in stress response and development [3]
Specifically, mentions a promoter region for an AAA-ATPase that is activated in the presence of reactive singlet O2 species. -- Jmason
The low-oxygen-induced NAC domain transcription factor ANAC102 affects viability of Arabidopsis seeds following low-oxygen treatment. [4] -- Jmason
In Saccharomyces
Ixr1p regulates oxygen-dependent  HEM13 transcription [5]
Great article that analyzes the effects of different promoters during hypoxia, also explains how they generated hypoxic conditions in lab -- Jmason
In Bacteria
Sinorhizobium meliloti, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, forms a symbiotic relationship with legumes in the root nodules of the plant. Because these bacteria must produce enzymes to modify environmental nitrogen, they are also able to detect levels of oxygen using the FixL-FixJ two-component system. [6] -- Skearney
The DosT/DevS system found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has an analogous oxygen-sensing function. [7] -- Skearney
