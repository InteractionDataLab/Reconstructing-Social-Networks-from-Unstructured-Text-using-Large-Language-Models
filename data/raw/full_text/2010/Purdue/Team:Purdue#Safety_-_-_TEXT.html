Safety
Please use this page to answer the safety questions posed on the safety page .
1.  Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:          * researcher safety,          * public safety, or          * environmental safety?
If the ADH promoter were fully functional and put into the field, one major concern would be the invasion of the modified plants into territory of native plants.  It would be key to develop a way to control where the plants grow.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,          * did you document these issues in the Registry?          * how did you manage to handle the safety issue?          * How could other teams learn from your experience?
No, none of our parts raised safety issues.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?          * If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?          * If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Our project is only a biosafety level one, so the review board at Purdue is not concerned with the project.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
