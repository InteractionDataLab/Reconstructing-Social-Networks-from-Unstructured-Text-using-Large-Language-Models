Notes from 5/28

1) Parthenolide (PN)
PN is a lactone naturally found in the plant "feverfew," and it is highly concentrated in flowers and fruits. One of our previous CPIP members from Julia Kirshner's lab used this as a novel treatment for multiple myeloma. He also used one of breast cancer cell line, and PN was very useful on treating these cells. I just realized that PN has an anti-cancer potential and it is also produced from a plant, so I thought it could be useful. I am sure Dr. Kirshner still has PN in her lab, so I do not think it is difficult to obtain it.
2) O2 Sensitive Transcription Factors
As Dr. Rickus mentioned, glioblastoma cell line we have now is said to be resistant to hypoxia. I am still not sure how it is applicable with O2 Sequestration idea, but certainly glioblastoma has transcription factors working in lack-of-oxygen environment and O2 Sequestration needs transcription factors for hemoproteins in excess-of-oxygen environment. Both of them are O2 sensitive, and there could be a connection between them.
3) Anti-angiogenesis?
I just thought of this when John mentioned cancer-fighting plants, but even if we are not taking this approach, it is still interesting to watch this TedTalk
If there are plants that have anti-angiogenesis elements, which inhibit the growth of blood vessels that feed cancer cells to grow, then we could certainly look into them.
