Team:Purdue/Seed sterilization
From 2010.igem.org
Materials
Sterile distilled water
70% ethanol
50% bleach/1 drop Tween 20: prepare 40 ml in a Falcon tube, use bleach that is less than two months old
Procedure
Transfer a small scoop of seed to an eppendorf tube; soak seed for 30 minutes in distelled water
Spin down seed briefly in microfuge
Decant water, add 500 uL 70% EtOH, vortex, spin
Decant EtOH, rinse with sterile water, spin and decant
Add 0.8 mL 50% bleach, vortex for 8-10 min, spin and decant
Add 0.8 mL sterile water, vortex, spin, decant
Repeat Step 6 six times
Leave seed in 0.5 mL of 0.12% sterile agar; allow to stratify at 4 degrees for at least 2 days
Notes
Keep the ethanol step as brief as possible-prolonged exposure to EtOH decreases germination
Multiple water washes are to remove all traces of bleach which also affects germination
Do the procedure in a hood in the tissue culture room
Store washed seed for stratification in refrigerator vegetable drawer in the prep room
