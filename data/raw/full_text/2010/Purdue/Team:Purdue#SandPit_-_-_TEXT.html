Standard Assembly Methods for assembling dna
remember that we are supposed to use a standard assembly method for construction of our parts.  if we do not use the BioBricks iGEM standard assembly then we must get approval for the method we choose.  many teams have moved away from the original BioBricks iGEM assembly to more robust methods
