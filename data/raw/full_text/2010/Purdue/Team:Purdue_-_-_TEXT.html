Purdue Wiki users:  Be certain to include "Team:Purdue/" before any pages you create to avoiding causing conflicts with other teams' pages.  If you are confused, contact me, or temporarily store your content on your user page.  I've created a template that should ease linking to internal pages. -- Jmason
