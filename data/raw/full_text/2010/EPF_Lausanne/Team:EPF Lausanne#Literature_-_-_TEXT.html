Here's a list of papers from which we got some ideas / inspiration and useful information
Asaia related
Bacteria of the Genus Asaia: A Potential Paratransgenic Weapon Against Malaria I (Henrike) did not manage to get this paper... could anybody send it to me please?
Bacteria of the genus Asaia stably associate with Anopheles stephensi, an Asian malarial mosquito vector isolation of Asaia from mosquitoes and expression of GFP
Paternal transmission of symbiotic bacteria in malaria vectors Asaia transmission and stable Asaia mCherry strain
Cloning of Escherichia coli lacZ and lacY Genes and Their Expression in Gluconobacter oxydans and Acetobacter liquefaciens Asaia plasmid
Blocking Plasmodium transmission
Bacteria expressing single-chain immunotoxin inhibit malaria parasite development in mosquitoes Immunotoxin against malaria parasite, composed of Shiva-1 and mouse single-chain antibody fragment against Pbs21. Expressed in E. coli, but in inclusion bodies (might be a problem for us!!!). Inclusion bodies were solubilized, refolded and purified and then shown to inhibit ookinete development.
A single-chain antibody fragment specific for the Plasmodium berghei ookinete protein Pbs21 confers transmission blockade in the mosquito midgut 13.1 scFv single-chain antibody fragment against ookinete protein Pbs21
In vitro cytocidal effect of novel lytic peptides on Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi Shiva-1
Ideas
Engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts This might help us to make an Asia plasmid?
