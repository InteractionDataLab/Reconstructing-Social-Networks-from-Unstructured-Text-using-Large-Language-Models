Lab Protocols
On this page we collect summaries of the procedures we have learned in the lab. These protocols are kept in a very simple non-scientific language since they should also be understood quickly by the non-biology students. They are specific to the lab of professor Maerkl where the iGEM team is working this summer. The protocols should enable the new team members in the lab to learn procedures quickly so that we don't have to bother Henrike and the other TA's too much.
