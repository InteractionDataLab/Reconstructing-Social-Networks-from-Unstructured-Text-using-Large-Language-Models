How to use the Notebook
This is a NOTEbook and not a LABbook. Here you can describe what you have done during your exciting day. If you want to have more details you can look in the IRL Labbook. Use ctrl+F to find something ;)
template of the day
For each new day in the lab you must create a new date in the notebook. To do so, copy-paste the following template:
= 02-08-2010 = {| cellspacing="15" | style="width: 33.33%" valign="top" | == Other == It rain a lot today  | style="width: 33.33%" valign="top" | == Asaia == Today I speak with an asaia and she answer to me ^^  | style="width: 33.33%" valign="top" | == Drosophile ==   |}
Here are some useful explanations :
1. The date format is important!
2. Just after the date, put the following two lines :
{| cellspacing="15" | style="width: 33.33%" valign="top" |
3. Beetween each subtitle, put this line :
| style="width: 33.33%" valign="top" |
4. To end the day just put :
|}
5. Of course the text "width:33.33%" must be adapted on how many subtitle you have (for instance 4 subtitles = 25%)
