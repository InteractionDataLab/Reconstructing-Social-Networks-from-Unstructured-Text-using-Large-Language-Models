Materials and Methods
We grew E.Coli DH5a transformed with the plasmid C3 containing the immunotoxin with the strong promoter ( BBa_K320006 ). As a negative control we used cultures transformed with the C3 plasmid alone.  We harvested a culture volume of 100 ml. The pellets as well as the supernatents were used as samples for a protein analysis.  The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (prepared as described in the Knight protocol ) containing urea and sonicated for 15 minutes. For the western blot the samples were run on an SDSpage gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The detection was accomplished using the following antibodies: Anti-his biotin as primary and Streptavidin-HPR as a secondary antibody. Additional to the primary antibody we applied Anti-his HRP.  The supernatants were run through a filter device with a 5 kDa cutoff (“centricon”). These samples were also anayzed with a western blot as described above.
