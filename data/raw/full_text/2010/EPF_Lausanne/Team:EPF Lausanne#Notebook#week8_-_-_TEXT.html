Asaia
Liquide culture of WT Asaia. We took the cultures of Asaia (5ml each) made the 27th to see in which antibiotic Asaia grew: Asaia did not grow on Kan, GM (Gentamicin), Tet and did grow on Amp, Cm and medium without antibiotics. For Tet something did grow so we made the cultures with Tet again.
