Immunotoxin
The immunotoxin is composed of two main parts. The first is a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) directed to Pbs2l, a surface membrane protein of P. berghei ookinetes. This fragment is linked to the second part, a lytic peptide, Shiva-1. Shiva-1 is a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence similar, in terms of length (38 amino acids) and amino acid properties, to Cecropin B which is an antibacterial peptide. The purpose of the immunotoxin is to specifically target and lyse the parasite.
Previous experiments conducted show that feeding mosquitoes with recombinant E.Coli that expressed this immunotoxin induced a significantly lower oocyst density. [1]
However E. Coli is not a natural symbiote of the mosquito. We would like to contribute to the fight against malaria  by engineering Asaia in order to express the immunotoxin in the mosquito's intestinal tract, and run experiments to see if it significantly reduces the number of oocysts.
The sequence of the immunotoxin was taken from our reference paper [1], and the codons were optimized for E.Coli. The codon optimized sequence can be found here .
"P-proteins"
The ookinete has been intensively studied by scientists, looking for an ideal transmission-blocking vaccine target. IGEM EPFL team's interest goes toward the ookinete surface membrane proteins Pfs25 and Pfs28. In fact, it has been shown that the binding of specific antibodies to these surface proteins was fatal to more than 99% of the parasites[2]. Indeed, P25 and P28 seem to be essential to the ookinete survival, the crossing of the midgut epithelium and its transformation into an oocyst.
The team decided to design Asaia to express a soluble form of these 2 P-proteins. It could seems contra-intuitive to provide more of these proteins (by expression in Asaia) that are very important for the parasite survival, migration, and development. But our hypothesis is that adding a lot of these proteins in a soluble form will compete with the parasite surface protein and prevent the interaction necessary to its transmission. Because the functions of P25 and P28 are redundant, both proteins need to be inhibited or outcompeted to efficiently block the malaria transmission.
results*
The p-proteins were not codon optimized for E.Coli, they have the native P.falciparum sequence. P. falciparum has an atipycal genome, very A-T rich. This could explain why there was some difficulties for E.Coli to express our P-proteins. A way to improve the expression could be to optimize the P-proteins codons for E.Coli.
