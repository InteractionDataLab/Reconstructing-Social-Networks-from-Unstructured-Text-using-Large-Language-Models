Gel with products of digestion run --> only one of the base vector samples and a fragment with the origin and a Kan resistance worked. The others probably did not wok since the concentration of DNA was too low.
Colonies picked and suspension cultures started. For making a miniprep tomorrow morning.
Gel cut, Gel purification made
New idea: PCR run on the product of the miniprep.
Ligation of Base Vector with Origin+Kan
