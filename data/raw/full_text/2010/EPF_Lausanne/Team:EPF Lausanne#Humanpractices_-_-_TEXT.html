Team:EPF Lausanne/Humanpractices
From 2010.igem.org
Movie
We made an animated movie presenting our project. This allowed us to introduce synthetic biology in a pleasant, but constructive way to a broad public. To measure the educational impact of our movie, we created a survey and showed participants either our movie or a "neutral" one as a negative control. Our overall aim therefore is to make the public more aware of the benefits that synthetic biology can bring to society by introducing its concepts in amusing, but nevertheless instructive fashion.
Running for iGEM
During the summer we met a few mornings to run along the lake (and sometimes even swim!!!) before going to the lab... The ultimate aim is to run the Lausanne Marathon (quarter or half of it) !!! Sunday 31 October we'll run for iGem!!!
