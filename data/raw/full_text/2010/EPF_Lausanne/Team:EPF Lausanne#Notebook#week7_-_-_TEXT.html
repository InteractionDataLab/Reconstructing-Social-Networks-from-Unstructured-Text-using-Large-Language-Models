Week 7
23-08-2010
BioBricks
The transformation of E-coli with the circular C3 didn't work.... The big problem is that we haven't no more C3 in stock. So to recover some C3, we decide to transform E-coli DH5alpha with the vector C3 + RFP.
We made a colony PCR with the E-coli transformed with C3 + [Strong promotor | Weak promotor] + [ nothing | Immunotoxine]. The C3 + W/S work but the immunotoxine didn't. => liquid culture from the colony how work.
Asaia
Drosophile

BioBricks
We do some GLY stock from the colony how work yesterday. Then with the rest of the liquid culture we made miniprep to send the plasmid to sequencing. We also do some liquid culutre with E-coli transformed with C3 + RFP. We'll do GLY stock tomorrow. We made a colony PCR of E-coli transformed with C3 + Asaia origin but the result fail. To try to construct C3 + [Strong promotor | Weak promotor] + [Immunotoxine | P25 | P28]. Two step today : digestion of all plasmids and overnight ligation. We send 4 plasmid to sequence :
C3 + Weak promotor
C3 + Strong promotor (colony #7)
C3 + Strong promotor (colony #8)
C3 + Asaia origin + Kan
C3 + Asaia origin + Amp
Asaia
Result from yesterday seem to indicate that Asaia Wild Type is naturally resistant to Amp and Ch. We redo some test to be sure we've do any mistake.
Drosophile
25-08-2010
Biobricks
The plasmids we sent to sequencing came back positive. We have now 4 biobricks.
C3 + Asaia_origin + Kan
C3 + Asaia_origin + Amp
C3 + weak promoter + RBS
C3 + strong promoter + RBS
We also ran a gel with C3 + asaia origin. It looks good.
Asaia
Drosophilae
We restarted the experiment with the drosophila. This time, we crushed 15 flies and we washed them in ethanol for only 2 seconds (maximum). We also did the plating of the flies 3h after infection
26-08-2010
Biobricks
We did a digestion and ligation of our 2 vectors C3 + S and C3 + W with the immunotoxin, P25 and P26. In the end, we should have 6 new biobricks.
Asaia
We are still not sure if Asaia "WT" is resistant to kanamycin or not. Maybe we will have to use another resistance in our biobricks, TetR for instance.
Drosophilae
We are doing the crushing and plating of the drosophilae that were infected 24h ago.
