Week 3
26-07-2010
Lemaître experiment: 400 ml cultures of GFP Asaia, Ecc15 and P.Entomophila
Lemaître experiment: separating male and female drosophila
Transformation of the Base Vector with -Kan-ori- insert into E.Coli DB3.1
PCR of LovTab as a positive control to check if the PCR works (with own and Henrike's dNTP's) --> Run gel
Test-digestion of some of the Mini-preps (Ori alone, Ori-Amp) --> Run gel
Recovered the wildtype Asaia worked!!
WT Asaia strains arrived. Culture started
27-07-2010
Ligation C3/A3 + Ori + resistance (Kan, Amp, Tet, Cm)
transformation of the ligation products into E.Coli DH5a
Plating of transformed cells with selection of the vector and the insert
Colony PCR of E.Coli DB3.1 containing BaseVector + Ori + Kan --> running gel (twice, the first time failed)
Preculture of (maybe!!) WT Asaia for competence protocol
Sorting of male/female flies
Culture of 400 ml of different species of bacteria.
28-07-2010
Analysis of plating of transformed cells
Gel for check the Colony PCR
250 ml Gly medium
OD measurement of preculture for competent Asaia --> too high. Start a new one!!!
Competent Asaia and stocking @-80°C
Plating of transformed E.Coli for double check
preparation of the pellets for infection with 3 different species of bacteria + OD measurements
preparation of tubes with 15 female flies
begin of the survival experiment: infection of flies --> check of the flies after 2h
29-07-2010
Results from plating of transformed E.Coli for double check and miniprep from some of them
Digestion with different restriction enzymes to check if we get the right length
Counting of dead flies one day after the infection
Observation of fluorescence of infected flies under the microscope
30-07-2010
Running a gel of the digested products of miniprep (29.07) --> bad results
Miniprep for the last 17 samples of replating
Digestion of 5 samples with 3 restriction enzymes to check if we get the fragments we expect
Running a gel for the digestion products
Counting of dead flies two days after the infection
Observation of fluorescence of infected flies under the microscope
