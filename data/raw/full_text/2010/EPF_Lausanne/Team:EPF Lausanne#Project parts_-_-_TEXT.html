ork in E. coli, which is very useful for our sets of experiments.
Cloning
We performed all the cloning in E.coli, and ran experiments on Asaia transformation, growth, and antibiotic resistance in parallel.
As the E. coli origin of replication does not work in Asaia, we added an origin that is compatible with Asaia (which was recovered from a GFP-plasmid transformed into the Asaia we received from Italy). Conversely, Asaia's origin of replication works in E. coli, which is very useful as all cloning can be performed using standards developed for E. coli.
BioBricks
All our parts are in the pSB1C3 backbone vector (abbreviate C3).
First the legend:
Ori = Origin of replication for Asaia and E. coli
S = Strong Promoter
W = Weak Promoter
Immu = immunotoxin
P25 = Pfs25 protein
P28 = Pfs28 protein
Kan = Resistance to Kanamycin
Tet = Resistance to Tetracycline
This are the first and basic constructs we made. Just click on the part to get more information.
These are the BioBricks we obtained by combining the parts from above.
Here you get a global overview of our BioBricks construction plan.
Promoter characterization
To characterize the promoter we wanted to use in Asaia and E. coli we cloned it in front of a gene coding for CFP. By monitoring the CFP expression over time and comparing to a negative control that did not contain the CFP gene we could measure the activity of the promoter. We also recorded the growth of the two different cultures to see if expression would decrease the growth rate.
Both measurements were done at the same time in E. coli DH5a over 16 hours at 37°C and the results are averaged over 6 samples.
Unfortunately we can't compare our measurements with a well known promoter. Further characterization will focus on the measurement of the activity in Asaia.
