Colony PCR
Materials
Autoclaved water
PCR tubes
LB broth & plates
Qiagen PCR Core Kit: dNTPs, Taq, Buffers
Forward & reverse primers
Procedure
85.5μL autoclaved water were added to PCR tubes - one for each colony to be amplified.
Inoculate the tube with cells from the desired colony. With the same toothpick, simultaneously inoculate a 5mL LB liquid culture (with antibiotic) and streak an LB-agar plate.
Incubate PCR tubes in a thermal cycler for 10 minutes at 100°C. Remove and cool.
To each tube, add: 10μL 10x PCR buffer, 2μL 10mM dNTP mix, 1μL 10μM forward primer, 1μL 10μM reverse primer, 0.5μL Taq DNA polymerase. Note: it is generally much more efficient to combine all these in a single tube and scale up for multiple reactions.
Replace tubes in thermal cycler and initiate CPCR program (below).
Analyze reactions via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis:
Add 2μL NEB 6x Gel Loading Buffer to 10μL CPCR product.
Load into gel. Run for 30-40 minutes at 90-100V.
Stain/destain in EtBr and image using UV illumination.
