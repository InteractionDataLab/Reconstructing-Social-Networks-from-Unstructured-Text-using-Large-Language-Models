Monday 9/6
Colony PCR cultures of L95 (HSP-LacI-EYFP) cells imaged under microscope
Cells are vastly overgrown and unhealthy (cultures visualized after one weekend)
Fresh cultures of L95 cells grown in preparation for a proper microscope imaging session
Tuesday 9/7
Digested successful sigma32 (HtpR) BioBrick in preparation for ligation into pSB1C3 chloramphenicol backbone
Treat the digestion like a backbone digestion
Ligated the digest into pSB1C3
Cleaned up the lab in preparation for mandatory leave of absence
Wednesday 9/8
Photographed the results of transglutaminase long-term testing (6 week span)
Results are stunning: TGase + cells, TGase + cell lysate forms a dark grey-colored brick about 7mm diameter (culture tube was approximately 13-14mm inside diameter!)
Several TGase + acid and TGase + base show very dark, vivid colors unattributable to the acid/base
Mandatory leave of absence begins
Thursday 9/9
The lab is being used by a class.
Friday 9/10
The lab is being used by a class.
