Monday 8/30
Use a different plate of L62-1 cells (HSP-LacI-GFP), pick 3 different colonies and re-perform the HSP-LacI-GFP
Only use 0 mM Glucose and 5 mM Glucose
Make new digests of L54 (HSP-LacI-RBS), E0430 (EYFP), and RFP-TetR backbone
Ligate L54 to L56 (Lysis-Terminator), L54 to L57 (Another Lysis-Terminator), and L54 to E0430
Transform aforementioned ligations into cells, along with L90 and L91 (both HSP-Lysis)
Attempt PCR extraction and amplification of E. coli sigma 32 (HtpR) using Colony PCR protocol
Tuesday 8/31
Fluorescence spectrometry shows that cells in 5 mM glucose produces significantly less GFP than those in no glucose growth medium.
Transformations of L90-L95 grow slowly in 30 Celsius conditions; no colonies yet
Ran gel electrophoresis of E. coli sigma 32 PCR product
PCR product the right size! Order primers to turn sigma 32 (HtpR) into an RFC10 BioBrick
Completed first part in ligating L36 and L37 by PCR
Wednesday 9/1
Colonies appeared on L91 and L95 plates
Colony PCR of L91 and L95
Ran gel electrophoresis of L91, L95 colony PCR products
Completed second part in ligating L36 and L37 by PCR
Digest, ligate, and transform PCR product of L36-L37 into cells
Thursday 9/2
Primers for conversion of sigma 32 (HtpR) into RFC10 BioBrick received
Attempt PCR extraction, amplification and conversion to BioBrick of E. coli sigma 32 (HtpR)
Use same Colony PCR protocol as before
Ran gel electrophoresis of sigma 32 BioBrick PCR product
PCR product the right size!
Need to assemble BioBrick construct into the correct backbone plasmid, then transform, miniprep DNA, and send out for sequencing
Friday 9/3
No lab work today
