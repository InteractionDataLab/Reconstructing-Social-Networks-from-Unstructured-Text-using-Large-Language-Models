Monday 6/14
Discussed procuring items & lab space.
Prepared for SURF start.
Tuesday 6/15

GANTT Chart diagramming our planned progress throughout the summer.
Detailed possible side projects, open to any member as time permits:
Agarase
pH/Environmental Response
Phototaxis
Colored plastic
Activa (transglutaminase)
Procured supplies from stock room
Cleaned out lab space
Prepared LB-amp media & plates
Wednesday 6/16
Procured remaining antibiotics & sample of XL1 Blue cells
Prepare orders for Sigma, NEB, and others
Sigma: Crosslinking compounds, substrates (linseed oil & soybean oil)
NEB: Biobrick assembly kit, Ladders, polymerase

Agarase bricks
Thursday 6/17
Made stock solutions for transformation and subsequent culturing
Transformed XL-1 Blue E. Coli with selected BioBricks
J09250 , K124017 , K124014 , R0082 , B0015 , B0034 , I13601 , pBAD 18 plasmid
Ordered more BioBricks:

K108001
K112806
K284001
I737020
(We also wanted to order sequencing primers G00100 & G00101 , but apparently those aren't sent to teams.)
