Monday 7/5
Note: Today was another Institute Holiday.
Tuesday 7/6
Hydrolyzed linseed oil. The reaction solution will be characterized on Wednesday.
Wednesday 7/7
Attempted to make V1012 (strain CP919, KanR, envZ deficient) electrocompetent:
Centrifuged overnight 3mL LB-Kan culture at 4°C, 16000rcf for 10min.
Discarded supernatant. Resuspended pellet in 1.5mL ice-cold water. Centrifuged again.
Repeated with 0.75mL ice-cold water.
Resuspended pellet in 1.5mL ice-cold 10% glycerol.
Flash-froze 100μL aliquots in dry ice/ethanol.
Transformed light/lysis ligation product from last week into V1012 via electroporation. (Voltage: 2.5V; time constant: 4.5)
Plated 100μL on LB-Tet agar plate & inoculated a 5mL LB-Tet overnight culture.
Inoculated 5mL LB-Kan culture of purely V1012 in case we need to retry the competence procedure.
Tested pigment production of cells containing K274100 in various solutions.
Tested solutions of LB, LB without yeast extract added, 80% glycerol, 100% glycerol, and glycerol with different concentrations of agar.
Since the brick is under an arabinose-inducible promoter, two versions of each solution were made - one containing arabinose, and one without arabinose.
Pigment production was subjectively measured every hour for five hours.  It seemed like there wasn't going to be much pigment produced so the solutions were left overnight in the shaker.
Obtain the absorbance of hydrolyzed linseed oil using ethanol as blank. The peak shifts toward larger wavelength comparing to pure linseed oil.
Test the absorbance of .25wt% agar in glycerol, .5wt% agar in glycerol and water at 632nm.  .25 wt% agar gives the lowest absorbance value.
Thursday 7/8
The V1012 transformation appears to have worked - the plate is covered in 1000+ colonies.
Made freezer stock from parallel liquid culture.
Miniprepped the DNA and prepared a sample for sequencing.
Started LB liquid culture of M30109 for assembly tomorrow, along with cultures of J04450 to perform a quick lysis test (in preparation for testing the lysis construct).
Prepared 2YT and SOB media in preparation for making electrocompetent DH5α cells tomorrow. Also prepared all glassware and other supplies.
Completed schematics for our printing process, including a detailed gene network diagram. We will begin assembly of the 3D genetic constructs tomorrow.
Results of the pigment test with K274100 : None of the cells seemed to have created the red pigment we were looking for.
It seems likely that that all the cells died.
Did not have a visible pellet of cells in the glycerol and agar solutions after centrifugation.  The solutions were probably too viscous.
Friday 7/9
Digested bricks according to NEB BioBrick assembly kit protocol.
R0077 (both upstream and downstream)
C0077 (upstream)
C0076 (upstream)
M30109 (downstream)
Began ligation reactions
R0082 / R0077 / pSB1T3
C0077 / B0015 (previously digested)/ pSB1T3
C0076 / B0015 (previously digested)/ pSB1T3
Transformed ligation products into DH5alpha cells.
Created liquid cultures
ligation 1 product - C0076 / B0015 (previously digested)/ pSB1T3
ligation 2 product - C0077 / B0015 (previously digested)/ pSB1T3
ligation 3 product - R0082 / R0077 / pSB1T3
B0015
K124017
Background reaction using AIBN
Test both lysed and unlysed cell
Solvent: .1 ml .5 wt % agar in glycerol
Amount of AIBN: 3 wt % with respect to the cell pellet.
Reaction is run under theater light for 3 hrs.
The unlysed cell appears to be lysed at the end of 3 hrs.
Weekend 7/10-11
Made minipreps of B0015 and K124017
Transformation results: Transformations failed.
There could be a problem with the antibiotic used or there could also be an issue with the digestions and/or ligations.
Background reaction using AIBN with more controls
After 3 hrs of reaction, transfer a small sample from each reaction into separate 5 ml of LB solutions and leave the solution in the shaker overnight.
The sample from the reaction with 3wt% AIBN, glycerol, and cells containing K274004 biobrick produces a slightly cloudy solution with large amount of dark green pigments precipitated at the bottom, which is similar to the sample taken from a lysed solution.
