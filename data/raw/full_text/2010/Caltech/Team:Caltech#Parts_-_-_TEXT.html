Apparatus
The red/infrared light apparatus
The red/infrared light emitting apparatus we built to test our heat shock promoter was modeled after the original Light Cannon . It features a theater lamp with a Roscolux #22 Deep Amber red/infrared light filter ( Amazon , Spectrum Data ).
We placed this light on the bench top above a rudimentary stage. By varying the height of the lamp above the stage, we could vary the temperature and light intensity at the stage. In the image, the stage temperature was measured to be 42°C.
Stage of the light apparatus; temperature at 42°C.
