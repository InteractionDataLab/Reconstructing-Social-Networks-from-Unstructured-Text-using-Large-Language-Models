Transformation by Electroporation
Materials
N samples of DNA to be transformed, 1 positive control sample
N+1 electroporation cuvettes
N+1 50μL aliquots of EC cells (we used DH5α)
N+1 mL SOC (Super-optimal broth + 10mM glucose)
N+1 LB-agar plates of appropriate resistances
Procedure
Chill electroporation cuvettes and thawed EC cells on ice. Do not let EC cells warm to above ice-cold.
Add 1μL of ligation product to the 50μL aliquot. Don't forget an aliquot for positive control.
Transfer DNA/cell mixture to a cuvette and pulse at 2.5V. Rescue the cells immediately by adding 0.75mL warm SOC to the cuvette.
Ensure that the time constant is above 3.0 for each.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
Plate the entire mixture on an LB-agar plate with the appropriate antibiotic resistance, grow overnight.
