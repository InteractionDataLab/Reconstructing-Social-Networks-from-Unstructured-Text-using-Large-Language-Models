Monday 7/19
Digest test gel with US and DS digested bricks. (7/19)
Group meeting!
Discussed issues with cloning and next week's focus.
Performed a digest (now for 2hr) and ligations (L18-23). Transformed into DH5α.
Turns out that the sequencing primers we ordered (G00100 & G00101) are incorrect - they appear to bind on the wrong sides of the insert. We ordered new primers designed to bind to the BioBrick prefix and suffix.
Ran gel of digest product to verify correct bands.
Tuesday 7/20
All ligation transformations failed. Will try 16hr ligations and purifying digest products with a PCR purification kit.
Made new growth curves testing AIBN effect on cells in LB
Performed another live/dead assay
Had solutions of cells in glycerol and AIBN
Plated cells every hour for three hours
Combined glycerol solutions with LB and plated the solution
New 16hr ligation procedure:
30μL total: 2μL T4 ligase, 3μL 10x ligase buffer, 5μL vector, 10μL of each brick. Incubate for 16hr at 16°C.
Started more cultures to miniprep tomorrow: I13504, J04450, K274002, M30109.
Wednesday 7/21
Transformed 3μL of each ligation product from yesterday (time constants all w/in 3.8-4.0). Plated 50μL of each on plates.
Thursday 7/22
Digest test gel with upstream, downstream, and backbone digested bricks. (7/22)
CPCR gel featuring L17, L18, L25, & L27. (7/22)
Prepared new sequencing primers in preparation for CPCR.
Transformation plates are almost completely empty - will centrifuge and plate remaining transformation cells.
Colony PCR mixture:
10μL 10x PCR buffer, 2μL dNTP mix, 1μL forward primer, 1μL reverse primer, 0.5μL Taq polymerase, fill to 100μL total. (Optional: add 20μL Qiagen Q buffer. Doesn't appear to help any of our reactions.)
Pick colony and add to water (85.5μL). Incubate at 100°C for 10min. Add remaining ingredients and begin PCR program:
Initial denaturation: 94°C, 4min
30 cycles:
94°C, 30s
54°C, 30s
72°C, 2min (1min/kb)
Final extension: 72°C, 10min
Finish: 5°C forever
Ran colony PCR on 4 ligations, 2 had the correct insert length: L17, L27.
Ran gel of digest products from yesterday to verify correctness of the digestion.
Friday 7/23
CPCR gel featuring L16, L17, L18, & L21. (7/23)
CPCR gel featuring L25, L26, L27, & L29. (7/23)
Plates containing the centrifuged transformation cells contained many colonies!
Began 21 more CPCR reactions on ligations: L17, L18, L21, L27, L29, L16, L26, L25
Note that because L18 is a coding sequence, it required the coding prefix primer; all others used the noncoding prefix primer.
Received our heat shock promoter from the Registry today! Made a plate and culture of this brick (K112400).
Purified yesterday's 4 CPCR reactions using a PCR purification kit.
Concentrations of each are all quite low (<20ng/μL) - we may want to increase the number of PCR cycles.
Ran 2 gels of all the CPCR results.
Weekend 7/24-25
Saturday 7/24
CPCR gel featuring L26 & L21. (7/24)
Started 4 new CPCR reactions on L21 and L26 to verify them more accurately.
Disposed of all failed cultures...
Prepped successful clones: 17-6, 18-3, 21-3, 26-1, 27-4, 29-2, and the heat shock promoter (K112400).
Prepared digest:
K215000 (u/d)
K112400 (u/d)
B0034 (u)
R0082 (u)
L17 (u)
L18 (u/d)
L26 (u)
I13504 (d)
L21 (d)
Began ligations: L16, L19, L42, L43, L44, L23, L24, L31, L40, L34, L35
Ran another gel of the CPCR products.
Sunday 7/25
Transformed all ligations from yesterday (time constants all within 3.6-4.0). Used 4μL for all, except for L34 & L35, which sparked, so used 3μL instead.
Made 2YT for making more electrocompetent cells.
Plated all transformation cells (centrifuged at 1000g for 15min).
