Prepped DNA for use in digestions tomorrow
Tuesday 8/10
Digested DNA for ligations:
L31: L17 + <partinfo>K215000</partinfo> + Kan
L32: L19 + L20 + Tet
L33: L19 + L18 + Tet
L34: L17 + L21 + Amp
L35: L18 + L21 + Amp
L41: L26 + <partinfo>B0015</partinfo> + Tet
L49: HSP + L40 + Tet

L61: <partinfo>K215000</partinfo> + L56 + Tet
L63: L29 + L20 + Amp
L64: L27 + L20 + Amp
Prepped 37-1, 54-5/-6, 55-5, 56, 57 DNA
Started CPCR of L36, L38
All colonies failed
Started liquid culture of <partinfo>I15008</partinfo>
Wednesday 8/11
<partinfo>I15008</partinfo> culture did not grow; will re-pick more tomorrow.
L43 plate had no colonies; will redo L43 tomorrow.
Began CPCR of all successful ligations (31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 41, 49, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64).
Gels:
gel 1: 35-2 & 63-3 successful
gel 2: 64-1 successful
gel 3: 36-6 successful
gel 4: 62-1 & 62-3 successful
Thursday 8/12
Prepped 4 successful (non-red) cultures: 35-2, 36-6, 62-1, 63-3
Digested:
35 (us)
36 (us)
37 (ds)
63 (us)
Started cultures of 62-1, <partinfo>I15008</partinfo>, <partinfo>I15009</partinfo>
Ligations:
L76: L35 + L20 + Tet
L58: L36 + L37 + Cm
L43: L17 + HSP-amp + Tet
CPCR: 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 41, 49, 60, 61, 64
gels appeared to have no bands at all... will re-run tomorrow.
Transformed L76, L58, L43
Friday 8/13
Ligation results:
L76: 0 colonies; failed
L58: > 500 colonies
L43: ~100 colonies
CPCR gels rerun from yesterday appear just as bad. 64-5 looks correct, but all other lanes are empty.
Cultured L55-5
Digested: <partinfo>I15008</partinfo> (ds), <partinfo>I15009</partinfo> (ds), L42 (bbone)
Ligated:
L41: L26 + <partinfo>B0015</partinfo> + T
L60: <partinfo>K215000</partinfo> + L57 + T
L61: <partinfo>K215000</partinfo> + L56 + T
L76: L35 + L30 + T
L77: L42 + <partinfo>pSB1C3</partinfo>
L78: L44 + L64 + T
L79: L19 + <partinfo>I15008</partinfo> + C
L80: <partinfo>B0034</partinfo> + <partinfo>I15009</partinfo> + C
CPCR: L76 x 6, L58 x 3; will run the gels tomorrow.
Transformed: L31, L32, L33, L34, L41, L60, L61, L76, L77, L78, L79, L80, <partinfo>I15010</partinfo>
AIBN crosslinking ability test with linseed oil and hydrolized linseed oil.
3%-wt of AIBN mixed with 20ml of solution
React for 5 hours at 60 degress Celsius water bath.
Solution left at room at room temperature overnight
white rod-shaped crystals were found in the solution second day
the crystals are suspected to be products of AIBN self-reaction
no sign of crosslinking
Weekend 8/14-8/15
Saturday 8/14
Ligation results:
Success: L31, L34, L77, L78, L79, L80
<partinfo>I15010</partinfo> and L33 both had < 5 colonies
Failed: L32, L76, L41, L60, L61
Ran gel of yesterday's CPCR results: no significant bands
More CPCR
3x of each: L31, L34, L77, L78, L79, L80, L33, L58, L43
