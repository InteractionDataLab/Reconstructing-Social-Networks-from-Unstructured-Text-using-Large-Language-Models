Monday 7/26
CPCR gel featuring L16, L19, L23, L24, L31 & L34. (7/26)
CPCR gel featuring L34, L35, L40, L42, L43 & L44. (7/26)
Started PCR reaction to extract the HSP (K112400) from its Berkeley Standard backbone (BBb). (Used same PCR parameters as CPCR from 7/22.
Group meeting!
By next week: Need to design test-construct experiments, as they will be ready sometime early next week.
Can use PCR machine to achieve easy temperature gradients
Use spectrophotometer and eventually microscope to assay fluorescence.
Consider a plate assay?
AIBN issues:
Consider using low-concentration DMSO to help dissolve AIBN in LB/cell mixture.
Need to figure out how much unreacted (or otherwise) AIBN remains after mixing with cells.
Need to test crosslinking using hydrolyzed and epoxidized oil mixed with lysate and with cells to tweak concentration of AIBN needed, and to see what it makes.
TGase:
purchase urea?
To prevent a solid plug forming upon addition of TGase powder to sample, prepare liquid stock of concentrated TGase.
Wiki:
Should visit biofab.org for research material for human impact segment.
In general, we should set goals for both the end of SURF and for the end of the summer and determine what we need to do to get on track for them.
Printing in 2D
Working AND gate, at least in bulk fluid
Characterization of 3D hydrogel/plastic
Crosslinking data
PCR purified K112400 PCR product & digested as plasmid insert.
Transformed RFP bricks of verious resistances to use as backbone for future ligations
Ran 2 gels of today's CPCR products.
Tuesday 7/27
CPCR gel featuring L16, L19, L31, L34, & L35. (7/22)
Began more CPCR on failed ones from yesterday: L16, L19, L31, L34, L35
Began more digests of miniprepped DNA from K112400
Made more electrocompetent cells. Began two test transformations.
Transformed ligation products: L42, L46, L47 and the HSP.
Began 11 new ligations:
L48: R0082 + I13504 + Cm
L31: L17 + K215000 + Kan
L34: L17 + L21 + Amp
L35: L18 + L21 + Amp
L22: K156012 + B0034 + Cm
L24: K156014 + B0015 + Cm
L20: C0077 + B0015 + Cm
L49: K112400 + L40 + Cm
L25: B0015 + M30109 + Tet
L26: R0077 + K124017 + Cm
L50: L18 + L27 + Amp
Note: Need to upstream-digest more of: J23119, L17, K156014, B0015 for future ligations.
Wednesday 7/28
Began CPCR reactions on the HSP, L42, L46, L48.
Transformed all ligations from yesterday
Re-ran gel from yesterday
Same results: looks like 19-4 is a success
Ran gel of today's CPCR to determine if the HSP ligations worked.
All bands appear to have a 100-400bp smear and no other bands, making the results indeterminate.
Thursday 7/29
Re-did the following ligations: L16, L31, L34, L35, HSP (in pSB1C3, for submission), L42, L46, L47
Started epic amounts of colony PCR:
3 colonies of each: L42, L46, L31, HSP-Amp, L35, L50, L34, L48, L24, L49, L22, L20
Gels for each are included to the right ->
Successful: L42-4/-5, L46-4/-5, L47-4, HSP-Amp-5/-6
Friday 7/30
Prepped 47-4 (HSP + B0034), L42-4/-5, L46-4/-5 (HSP + R0077), HSP-Amp-5/-6
Began a ton of digests:
2x Tet backbone
U19: K156012 (us)
U20: K156014 (us)
U21: C0077 (us)
U22: L19 (us)
U23: L46 (us)
U24: L47 (us)
U25: L17 (us)
D17: B0034 (ds)
D18: B0015 (ds)
D19: L18 (ds)
D20: L19 (ds)
D21: HSP-Amp (ds)
Weekend 7/31-8/1
Saturday 7/31
Transformed L22, L24, L33, L43
Failed: L51, L52, L53, L25 (cuvette arced)
Ran gel of M30109 CPCR product: no bands!
Is M30109 incorrect?
Sunday 8/1
Removed transformation plates: L22 & L24 were successful; L33 & L53 failed.
