Abstract
Our project aims to use dual-wavelength light transduction to produce arbitrary 3D shapes of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) plastic from soybean oil. Using a radical crosslinking reagent, we will crosslink PHB oligomers in cell lysate, released upon a light-induced lysis gene network. We hope to apply this capability to three dimensional  printing, offering a cheap alternative to current rapid-prototyping technologies. We also plan to apply special consideration to the ramifications of possible commercial enterprises developed in iGEM competitions with open source materials, such as BioBricks.
Specific goals include:
Maximize the speed of the printing process
Minimize the resources and know-how required to print
Maximize the resolution of our printer
Maximize the hardness of the plastic produced
Minimize the smell of bacteria in the final product
Create colored plastic using bacterial pigments
Research crosslinking other compounds to create hydrogels instead of plastic
