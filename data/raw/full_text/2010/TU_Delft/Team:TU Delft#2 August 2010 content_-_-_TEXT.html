Lab work
Alkane Sensing, Solvent Tolerance and Salt Tolerance
by Pieter
The plates containing yesterday's ligations contained colonies, to check whether they really contain the desired BioBrick a colony PCR was done, and the used colonies were grown in liquid LB medium over night. The results from the PCR were analysed on a 1% agarose gel.
BBa_K398305 = Alks -> E0240
BBa_K398101 = bbc1 -> J61101
BBa_K398402 = PhPFDalpha -> J61101
BBa_K398403 = PhPFDbeta -> J61101

Emulsifier
When going over the plates in the fridge we noticed a few white colonies on plates from 13-07-'10. Previously we thought there were only red colonies. So we decided to do a colony PCR on all 12 white colonies.
BBa_K398202 = R0011 + B0032

Isolated plasmid
None of the bands is truly positive. Still number 4,5 and 9 could be positive. Or due to the GC content the bands could be shifted a little bit upwards, so that maybe even sample 12 could be positive.
Just to be sure, we isolated the plasmids and send them to BaseClear for sequencing. The results will be in by Thursday.
Alkane degradation
For the next step in BioBrick formation a digestion was done:
