Lab work
Alkane degration
Yesterday's plates showed colonies. To check whether these contained the desired insert a colony PCR was performed. The products of this PCR were checked on a gel.
On the gel, two colonies of 011A showed the right length. None of the lengths for 013A or K were correct. They did however match the PCR length (009A, 482) of one the inserts which was digested in order to create this BioBrick. Next week we will take a few more colonies from the plate and check these, and otherwise the digestion and ligation will be tried again.
