Team:TU Delft/Collaboration
From 2010.igem.org
Collaboration
No iGEM Team can work on its own. The collaboration that is encouraged - not only with present year's teams but also through the use of parts from previous teams - is what makes iGEM feel like a community.
We own enormous gratitude to many people and organizations:
