2.1 Digestion
2.2 Ligation
Alkane degradation
Unfortunately last week's attempts hadn't yielded any BioBricks making use of the 2-way ligation method. We thus decided to take another stab at the 3-way ligation procedure, according to the BioBrick Assembly Manual of Ginkgo Bioworks. The BioBrick numbers we tried to construct were: 014C, 020C, 405C, 327C and 304C.

The digestions were executed for 15 minutes at 37 degrees, and checked on 1% agarose gel :
1% agarose gel run at 100V for 1 hour. Of all samples 10 µL was loaded with 2 µL loadingbuffer. 2 µL was loaded of marker

The ligations were performed in parallel: one batch using the NEB T4 DNA ligase and buffer, the other batch the Fermentas T4 DNA ligase and buffer. We hope to be able to discern the differences in efficiency between the two (if there are any). 1 uL of the ligation mixes was amplified using the universal primers to screen for pSB1C3 plasmids containing the proper ligated insert. The PCR mix was loaded onto 1% agarose gel :
1% agarose of colony PCR. Gel run at 90V for 50 minutes. Of all samples 5 µL was loaded with 1 µL loadingbuffer. 2.5 µL was loaded of SmartLadder

Transformation
The ligation products (19 uL) were used to transform 25 uL of commercially competent TOP10 cells (OneShot from Invitrogen) in accordance with the OneShot protocol. In order to test the background the digestion product of pSB1C3 was transformed (digestion control) as well as the ligation controls.
Alkane degradation parallel attempt
We are no longer betting on one horse to ligate the alkane degradation bricks together. So, besides the 3-way ligation mentioned above, we also tried to do a 2 way ligation as well.
