NOS Day
The NOS TV crew and Radio crew arrived at the same time. We divided our group so that both media could get to work. They were very interested in the cool world of science. We showed some of our lab skills and answered their questions.  We will be on the news "Journaal op 3" @ 22:10 on Nederland 3. Listen to the radio on 3FM at 18:00 to hear us !
