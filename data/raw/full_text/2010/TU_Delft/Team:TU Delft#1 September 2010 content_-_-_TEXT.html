Science Center Opening
Today was the official opening of the Science Center - TU Delft's technology museum. It was very exciting, because it was the first time the whole team saw the BioTech room we helped develop. It contains a lab-table, a wall displaying images of microorganisms, and a flow cabinet in which short movies are displayed on various subjects ranging from extremofiles to GFP and penicillin. Eva and Nadine star in these movies! Further more we also interviewed Karel Luyben, Rector Magnificus of TU Delft.
