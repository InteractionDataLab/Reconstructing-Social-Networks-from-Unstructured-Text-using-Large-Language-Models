Lab work
We are a bit short handed in the lab this week, because most team members have exams. Considering the fine weather outside, it is not bad to have a slow week.
BioBrick stocks
All the transformations of yesterday containing BioBricks form the distribution plate gave colonies. We pick a colony of every plate and grow them overnight in 50 mL LB medium containing Ampicillin.
Pseudomonas Putida GPO1
Today we cultivated Pseudomonas Putida GPO1 on different substrates to test on what carbon source it can grow:
1. E2 medium without carbon source
2. E2 medium + 1% LB
3. E2 medium + 10% LB
4. E2 medium + 1% octane
5. E2 medium + 10% octane
