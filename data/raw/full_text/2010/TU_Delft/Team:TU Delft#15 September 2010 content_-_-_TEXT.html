Shell Visit
A delegation of the TU Delft iGEM Team in front of the Shell R&D headquaters in Amsterdam
Today we went to Shell for a meeting with Henry van Straten (Manager Global Knowledge Centre Energy, Water, CO2) en Albert Janssen (Global R&D Coordinator Water Handling and Part-time professor Biological Gas and Water Treatment at Wageningen University). After a brief introduction on our project they gave us a lot of information about how Shell handles water throughout their production processes. With this information we can further calculate the feasability of the application of our project.
Emulsifier
In order to measure the emulsifier, we will need to cultivate the strains in M9 medium. Six flasks with 25 ml were inocculated:
Top10 with 206 and Amp
Top10 (control)
DH5alpha with 206 and Amp
DH5alpha (control)
K12 with 206 and Amp
K12 (control)
The controls were taken from the -80 cell stock.
Alkane degradation
No colonies on the 028 plates unfortunately...
We checked the 009 and 010 plasmids on gel (5μl each), because sometimes we didn't see any digestion product. On gel the plasmids barely or didn't show - they certainly didn't show the same concentration as the nanodrop. We'll grow then up again over night from the cell banks and try a DLT with freshly isolated plasmids.
