Session 11
First meeting after have chosen our subject.
Planning
Made a preliminary planning:
Today, team division and general discussion on how to approach things
Next meeting: Preliminary plan on general approach per group, possible questions for the whole group, and a general discussion. When making the lab-plans, also incorporate deadlines at which goals must be reached.
Following, weekly meetings to keep everyone up to date?
End of May: Meeting with the professors / staff of kluyver etc in which each group’s plan will be presented, and we will ask the people attending to give advise / comments / remarks
June: Lab work!
Meeting at Aljosha's place
Team Division
As already mentioned, our subject can be divided into 4 subparts, but each subpart will need team members as well as an initial plan of action.
1. Hydrocarbon degradation
Team members: Hugo, Mathias & Kira
Focus on alkenes
Paper by Rojo: 3 main enzymes, Make different strains for each type of alkene degradation (different enzymes for different lengths), Gene’s are in a cluster, so design a primer for this cluster,
Using GC for measuring the alkenes?
Hydrocarbon Resistance: Paper by Lazaroaie => This is phase 2! First start with a “normal” strain under mild conditions – check how high the normal resistance is?
Drug efflux pump will create Drug resistance in E.coli (ethical subject!), Pseudomonas & E.coli membranes are pretty similar according to Hugo
2. Salt tolerance
Team members: Nadine, Mia
Salt in the solution: test with sodium chloride
Conductivity or polarity measurements?
Paper with salt tolerancein E.coli: Kapardra
Biobrick: not well characterized? Check presentation? If not: Characterize it?
Ecotin? (osmoprotectant)
Regulation system? Sensor? Existing biobrick?
3. Emulsifier
Team members: Pieter, Eva
First look at hydrocarbon degrading organisms first, and what kind of emulsifier they excrete and see if we can use this (see nature review on huddle for further reference)
Designing our own peptide? (but this would be a bit more difficult, but possible, no more than 16 aa!)
Export would be the main problem? (Self-destroying population?)
Start by choosing the emulsifier
4. Modeling & possible products
Team members: Jelmer, Luke
MFA (3 days?) Alkene degradation: look at SB assignment…
Thermodynamics?
Prediction of growthrate (Heijnen hypothesis?)
Prediction of emulsion capacity
Molecular dynamics simulation
Towards the end of the project model if we could put everything together?
Regulation strategy for salt tolerance?
PHB, butanol or ethanol?
iJAM session 1
Our first iJAM session! The pictures were added to the iJAM album on Facebook
