Competent cells
At the same time Eva is making more competent cells . We go through our competent cells so quickly. To test the efficiency of the competent cells, 100 ng standard pUC19 vector was transformed and plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/mL Ampicillin. The plates were incubated on room temperature.
World Championship
We watched the World Cup game (the Netherlands - Brazil) in our iGEM room. Care was taken for many tasty snacks. Cake, chips and drinks Mmmmm.
