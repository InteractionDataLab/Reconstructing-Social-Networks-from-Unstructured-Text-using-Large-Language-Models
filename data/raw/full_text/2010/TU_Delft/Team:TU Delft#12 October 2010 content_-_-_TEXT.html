Team:TU Delft/12 October 2010 content
From 2010.igem.org
New Wiki
The previous design was already over 6 months old. Although we recieved many compliments about the design and setup we felt that it could be better. You are now looking at the result.
In coming few days we will uploaded the rest of the content.
ADH activities seem encouraging so far... After some issues with the protocol we can measure activity.
