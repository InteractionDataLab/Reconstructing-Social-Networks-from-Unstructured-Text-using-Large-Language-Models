We harvested the 1 mL bacterial cells of possible correct transformations. The pellets were stored at -20 °C. We used 3 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks .
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Fluorescence measurements Attempt #2
Data analysis to follow shortly (good stuff!)
Assembly of reference construct & positive control
Yesterday's digestion products of K081005 and I13401 were set for ligation over the weekend at 4 °C:

To all samples with an end volume of 25 μL, 2.5 μL Ligase buffer was added.
The Birnboim method was used to isolate J23100 and I13522 (both in pSB1A2) from the o/n 5 mL LB cultures. We used 3 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks . The following concentrations of plasmid were obtained:
