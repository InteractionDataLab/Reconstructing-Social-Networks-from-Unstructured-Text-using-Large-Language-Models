There was one change made in the network provided by CellNetAnalyzer for the NADH dehydrogenase reaction, annotated as NADHdehydro in CellNetAnalyzer. In the network of CellNetAnalyzer this reaction exports two protons, but this was changed to 4 as given by Ecocyc. This reaction is shown in figure 1.

The reactions from several genes from biobricks were used to transform alkanes in to fatty acids which enter the beta oxidation cycle. These genes are listed below.

</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biomass_formation">Biomass formation</SPAN></H2><P>The biomass is formed by many anabolic reactions that make monomers. All the anabolic reactions start at the so called key metabolites. There are 12 key metabolites and they are all in the glycolytic pathway and the TCA cycle. In the tool they are the red metabolites. For this analysis the anabolic reactions already present in CNA were used. These are a lot of reactions however and they will not be shown in this analysis, although they do occur. In the tool growth can ben seen as consumption of the key metabolites.

Less protons are exported per mol of NADH in comparison with oxygen as electron acceptor, so the ATP/NADH ratio will drop.

PHB is a solid product which is easy to recover in the down stream process.
</P><P>The pathway is displayed in figure 12. The enzymes present in this pathway are EC 2.3.19, EC 1.1.1.36 and EC 2.3.1.-.
</P><P>The lumped reaction was implemented in CNA as;
</P><P>2 acetyl-CoA + NADPH -&gt; (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA
</P><P>the polymerization reaction just consumes (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA, because a solid has no concentration in the liquid and therefore does not need to fulfill the steady-state condition. There are limiting factors to this reaction, but those are not considered in this analysis.

Isoprene is a volatile substance found in plants. <I>E. coli</I> will not be able to produce is in the near future, but it is an interesting product. It is a very reduced product, with a similar amount of electron per carbon atom as alkanes. Alkanes have 6 - 6.3 electrons per carbon atom depending on the length and isoprene has 5.6 electron per carbon electron.
</P><P>The pathway is displayed in figure 14. The enzymes in the pathway are EC 2.2.1.7, EC 1.1.1.267, EC 2.7.7.60, EC 2.7.1.148, EC 4.6.1.12, EC 1.17.7.1, EC 1.17.1.2 and EC 4.2.3.27. The reaction of enzyme EC 1.17.7.1 has been adjusted to generate only 1 oxidized ferredoxin. This was done to hold the electron balance. Ferredoxin is regenerated by consuming a NADH.
