Lab work
BioBrick stocks
Today we performed a Qiagen Mini-prep plasmid isolation of the vectors we grew overnight. We saved 3 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks .
The following plasmid concentrations were obtained:
BioBrick
Concentration (ng/μL)
pSB3T5
266.0
pSB1T3
414.0
pSB1C3
284.7
pSB3C5
329.3
pSB1K3
270.1
pSB1A3
271.9

Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Next to that we also started digesting the first parts we will be characterizing.
Strain Characterization
By Hugo
I prepared the cell bank according to the following procedure:
Spin 5 ml of the overnight culture
Add 500 ul of LB medium
Add 500 ul of 80% glycerol
Store the tube at -80ºC
Now, we have a cell bank ready to be used!!!
Spring Workshop
Almost the whole team left for the iGEM spring workshop in Évry, Paris. The drive for some of us was a bit laborious (traffic jams at the middle of the night/closed roads etc.), and others actually watched the World Cup soccer match... But in the end we all arrived at the hotel in Évry little before 2 AM, Saturday morning, and got some well deserved sleep.
