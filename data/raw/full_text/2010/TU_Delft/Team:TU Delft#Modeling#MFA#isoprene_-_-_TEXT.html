isoprene production
In previous situations the hydrocarbons were degraded only to form biomass and CO2. It is interesting to see how much product could be made from hydrocarbons. Isoprene is a volatile product found in plants. E. coli will not be able to produce is in the near future, but it is an interesting product It is a very reduced product, with a similar amount of electron per carbon atom. Hydrocarbons have 6 - 6.3 electrons per carbon atom depending on the length and isoprene has 5.6 electron per carbon electron. If these values are close to each other, it has a positive influence on the maximal theoretical yield. Also the volatile nature of isoprene is very favorable for the downstream process
The pathway is displayed here http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6270&detail-level=2
In this scenario the lumped isoprene production pathway was added to metabolic network;
1 pyruvate + 1 D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + 1 NADPH + 3 NADH + 3 ATP -> isoprene + CO2
