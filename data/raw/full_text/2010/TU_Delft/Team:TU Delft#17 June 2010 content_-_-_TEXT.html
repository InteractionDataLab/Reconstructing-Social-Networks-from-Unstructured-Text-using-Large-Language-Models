Today camera crew #2 came by from Nanopodium, a platform for exchanging thoughts, ideas, opinions and best practices on nanotechnology. They are making a movie about our project for the Nano Video Hunt.  This is a campaign started with Hyves were young people are challenged to post videos about their views on nanotechnology.
