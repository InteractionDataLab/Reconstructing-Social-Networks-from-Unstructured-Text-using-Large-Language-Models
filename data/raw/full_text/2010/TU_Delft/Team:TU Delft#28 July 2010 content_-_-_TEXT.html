Lab work
Hydrocarbon Sensing
Yesterday's transformations of the Biobricks AlkS-B0015 and AlkS-E0422 were checked with scPCR.
The resulting gel is shown below.
The colony #1 of AlkS-B015 and colony #2 AlkS-E0422 were used for plasmid isolation.
Alkane degradation
The plates containing yesterday's ligations contained colonies, to check whether they really contain the desired BioBrick a colony PCR was done, and the used colonies were grown in liquid LB medium over night. The results from the PCR were analysed on a 1% agarose gel.
1% agarose of colony PCR part 1. Gel runned at 100V for 1 hour. Of all samples 10 μL + 2 μL loadingbuffer was loaded. 5 μL was loaded of marker

From the scPCR it can be concluded that from all the colonies PCRed (per BioBrick), at least one was positive! Next week the next (last) step in making the BioBricks for alkane degradation can be be done, so hopefully the week after that we can start characterizing.
