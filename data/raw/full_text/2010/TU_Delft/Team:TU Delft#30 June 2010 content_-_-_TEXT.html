Lab work
BioBrick stocks
We harvested the 50 mL bacterial cells of the 14 BioBricks . We used 3 mL of the baceterial cells to make -80 °C stocks . With the rest we performed a Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid isolation .
The following plasmid concentrations were obtained:

Pseudomonas Putida GPO1
Pseudomonas Putida GPO1 is growing 1 day on different substrates . We measured absorbance of the Pseudomonas Putida to see on which conditions the strain survives. Absorbance measurements
