Lab work
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
E.coli Top10 strains containing the following composite BioBricks in pSB1A2 had been obtained :
BioBrick
Composed of:
K398500
J23100 + J61100 + I13401
K398501
J23100 + J61101 + I13401
K398502
J23100 + J61107 + I13401
K398503
J23100 + J61117 + I13401
K398504
J23100 + J61127 + I13401
To prepare for the fluorescence assay measurements the strains were grown in 3 mL LB medium containing 100 μg/mL AMP as well as in M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% glucose and 100 μg/mL AMP.
High copy number RBS characterizations are rarely indicative of RiPS in system operation plasmids, thus we are planning to also measure the fluorescence assays with the BioBricks on pSB3C5. In order to obtain sufficient BioBrick DNA the strains were grown in 250 mL LB with 100 μg/mL Ampicillin, awaiting plasmid isolation and plasmid swapping.
Emulsifier
The bricks for emulsifier production were assembled. The stock plasmids containing AlnA, OprG, R0011 and B0032 were digested and ligated into plasmid pSB1T3.
Digested were performed according to the digestion protocol :
