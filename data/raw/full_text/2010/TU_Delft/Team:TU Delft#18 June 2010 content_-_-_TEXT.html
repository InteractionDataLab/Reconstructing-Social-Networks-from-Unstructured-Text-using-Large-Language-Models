Cleaning
After all the media attention, we had a nice slow day. We finished some small experiments and reorganized our iGEM room. We hide all the stuff from last years team in a closet so now our room is nice and tidy.
We also booked a hotel in Boston!

Biobricks
By Hugo
I've got some colonies in the plates, however there's contamination with some yellow colonies :s Probably, we will have to prepare a new stock of competent cells.
