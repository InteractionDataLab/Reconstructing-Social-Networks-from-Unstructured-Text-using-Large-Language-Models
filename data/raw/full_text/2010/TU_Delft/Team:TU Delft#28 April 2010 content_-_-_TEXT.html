Session 9
1. Bacterial eye
The moment bacteria get a signal, they become fixed at this point
Coliroid – In the registry, mechanism that makes a “photo”
Negative activation is better (repression is better than induction)
Pigment degradation? Not needed if it’s just a one time thing
Vote: Yes (10/13)
2. pH Sensor
pH sensitive GFT which has different wavelengths at different pH, now used to measure intracellular pH
Perhaps make this exported to the extracellular?
Not sure which pH range it uses?
pH indicators?
Vote: No (6/13)
3. Plastic Soup
Plastic degradation for cleaning of the oceans
Vote: No (0/13)
