Lab work
Ordered DNA stocks
We harvested the 200 mL bacterial cells of the 16 DNA parts . We used 3 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks . With the rest we centrifuged at 4,000 rmp for 15 minutes and stored the pellets in the -20 °C.
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Tuesday's ligation products of BioBricks K398500-K398504 yielded successful transformants. Single colony PCRs were performed and loaded onto a gel. The bands on the 1% agarose gel indicated the presence of inserts with the proper lengths:
1 % agarose of colony PCR. Gel runned 1 hour at 100 V. Of all samples 5μL + 1 μL loadingbuffer was loaded and 5 μL was loaded of marker

The colonies belonging to lanes 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 were plated out on AMP plates to yield reincultures for subsequent characterization experiments.
Alkane degradation
Today we got the Gas Chromatograph working, we could identify several peaks. Now we are ready for the real experiments!
