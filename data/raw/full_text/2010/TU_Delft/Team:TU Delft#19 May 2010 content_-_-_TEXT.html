From 2010.igem.org
Session 13
Today we discussed the addition of another sub-group to our project: Hydrocarbon sensing. This could be linked to the expression of the various systems we are designing for efficiency purposes. Luke will take this on, will run in parallel.
We also determined we should order the Pseudomonas Putida OCT1 strain. This can be used as a positive control for hydrocarbon degradation, emulsifier production as well as alkene sensing.
Hand-wash test
We had a safety appointment - we had to wash our hands after having rubbed them with fluorescent lotion. This way we could see how well we washed them. All of us passed, except Ramon, so we won't be eating anything that he touched ;) Hugo, Alessandro & Jelmer also had to do a more extended safety test - the others didn't because this is a part of the Life Science & Technology educational program.
Waiting our turn
