Alkane degradation
There were some colonies on Tuesday's plates! We had left the plates @ 37°C yesterday after having seen that there were no colonies. When checking this morning on all plates (except the negative control) there were a few colonies! (2-50 colonies). Chances are it's not what we're looking for, but maybe they are good transformants... to check we will do a colony PCR .
1% Agarose gel of colony PCR. Gel runned at 100V for 1 hour. Of all samples 5 μL + 1 μL loadingbuffer was loaded. 5 μL was loaded of marker.

A number of colonies look promising! To check if they really are the BioBricks we want, tomorrow we will do a plasmid isolation with the cultures of lane 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 14. We will cut the isolated plasmids with various restriction enzymes and analyze the digestion products on gel.

Method 3
The Amp plates contained very few transformants. These were taken for single colony PCR and run on 1% agarose gel :
1% agarose of colony PCR. Gel run at 100V for 1 hour. Of all samples 5 µL was loaded with 1 µL loadingbuffer. 5 µL was loaded of marker

Due to the very short expected difference in bp between the constructs, the gel could not be conclusive. However, the transformants di not fluoresce when screened with UV excitation.
Method 4
After having stored yesterday's Amp plates in the fridge it was decided to screen once more for GFP fluorescence. This time multiple fluorescing colonies were found under UV excitation, indicating that the reference construct J23100-E0240 had been created. Three of the colonies were brought over to 5 mL of LB+AMP for over night culturing and characterization.
