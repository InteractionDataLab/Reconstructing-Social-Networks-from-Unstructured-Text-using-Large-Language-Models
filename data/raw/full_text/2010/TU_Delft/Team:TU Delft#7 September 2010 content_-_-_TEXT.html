Team:TU Delft/7 September 2010 content
From 2010.igem.org
Unfortunately, yesterday's plates showed no colonies again...The remaining ligation mixed used to transform yesterday was stored at -20C overnight, and placed back at 16C for another 4 hours today. Then, commercial Top10 cells were transformed using these ligation mixtures. We decided to use Top10 because so far are home-made competent K12 cells haven't been that successful yet.
