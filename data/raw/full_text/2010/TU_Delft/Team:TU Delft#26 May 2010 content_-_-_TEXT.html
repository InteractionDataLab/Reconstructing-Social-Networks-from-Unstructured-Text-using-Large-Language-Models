Team:TU Delft/26 May 2010 content
From 2010.igem.org
Session 14
Today we decided that we will have most of the genes we are going to implement in BioBricks synthesized. This will save time, and this way we can easily remove unwanted restriction sites prior to synthesis.
We also decided to do a RBS characterization prior to the 'real' project. This will help us learn how to work with BioBricks, and will help us span the time it will take to receive the synthesized DNA we have to order. For the RBS characterization we will characterize 5 RBSs with same promoter, GFP and two terminators using the standard protocol for BioBrick formation.

Suit Supply
During the meeting Suit Supply came by to take our measurements for the custom suits they will be sponsoring us with!
