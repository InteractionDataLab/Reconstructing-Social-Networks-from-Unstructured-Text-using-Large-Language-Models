</P><UL><LI> First we enumerated problems which might be solvable by synthetic biology, then we gathered as many ways to solve them as possible. It's important to allow any idea to be mentioned here, without any cricital judging of team members yet.
</LI><LI> In later rounds, we voted on which ideas to work out, split up in teams and assessed the ideas in terms of feasibility, cost, coolness and how useful they could be for synthetic biology.
</LI><LI> We ended with 3 detailed project ideas and voted on them, and oil degradation was chosen!
