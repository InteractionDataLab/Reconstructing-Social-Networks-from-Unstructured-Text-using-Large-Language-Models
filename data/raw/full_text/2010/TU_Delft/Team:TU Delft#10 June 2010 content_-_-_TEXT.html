Lab work
BioBrick stocks
Overnight we have grown the cells containing the vector backbones as well as the GFP-TT BioBrick . Today we have isolated the plasmids , but because the volumes were quite small (4 mL), we decided to grow a larger batch (250 mL) of all the cells overnight.
Strain Characterization
By Hugo
Ps. putida Colonies!!! Everywhere on LB medium... None in E2 media, but that could be due to the fact that the octane got evaporated; we don't know what happened with those that should be growing on glucose, though.
I picked three colonies and now they are growing on LB medium, I will prepare a cell bank for future experiments.
Education
Today we have an appointment at the Science Center , a science museum here in Delft. They are interested in making a section within the museum about iGEM and synthetic biology.
