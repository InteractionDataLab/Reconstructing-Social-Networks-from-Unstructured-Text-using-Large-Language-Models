1 Session 10
1.1 1. Motility
1.2 2. Magnetic Bacteria coupled to Styrene sensing and binding
1.3 Final idea elimination
Session 10
Continuation of session 8 & 9
1. Motility
Model system for motility:
Many different proteins involved, so sensitive to mistakes
Uncertainties on how the assembly works
Not realistic in time span
2. Magnetic Bacteria coupled to Styrene sensing and binding
Complex Mechanism
Still many unknown processes, e.g. how is Fe3+ converted to Magnetite?
E.coli probably couldn’t be used
Model organism for magnetic bacteria, Magenetospirillum gryphiswaldense: Cannot handle oxygen and what is the growth rate?
Do we need the vesicle formation?
Styrene sensing: how sensitive is this sensor? Can styrene dissolve?
Nadine presenting the Magnetic bacteria idea
Both of these idea's were eliminated from the selection
Final idea elimination
The presentations on oil degradation and bacterial eye (the two last remaining ideas) were given once again by Hugo and Luke, and this was followed by a discussion and a vote in which everyone was allowed to vote once.
We ended up choosing for oil degradation (all of us!)
Bacterial Eye
Oil removal
Luke
N: Do or die
P: Good presentation value
N: Solubility problems
P: Break up into parts
Jelmer
N: -
P: Could also be split into parts,   characterization of existing biobricks, if it’s too simple we could find more   stuff to do
N: Complicated and allot of work. Does   not feel qualified to judge on this
P: -
Mathias
P: Very Synthetic biology cool to   combine many biobricks
N: Regulation and boring
P: All in parallel
N: Could go wrong
Kira
N: Not appealing, small
P: -
N: too large a project?
P: Great PR, money problems will be   over, nice in parts
Hugo
N: No expansion opportunities
P: Biobricks are available
N: Time constraints (but we are with   9 people)
P: Money
Nadine
N: -
P: -
N: -
P: Parts that will work, even if   others don’t, PR, experts in the building
Eva
N: When it goes wrong we have nothing
P: Nice project
N: Time
P: Nice project, good PR
Mia
N: Groups will be dependent on each   other
P: More flexibility to try something   else
N: Time, cloning problems?
P: Interesting and challenging, each   group will be independent of the others
Pieter
P: Cool synthetic working with light
N: 9 people would be too much on this   one project
P: Hot topic
N: Large, might not end up with a   whole system, but at least a part of it
Allesandro
N: -
P: Classical synthetic biology   project, opportunities for modeling
N: What are the modeling opportunities?   (Aljoscha does see these: metabolic network,   production of different compounds)
P: -
Aljoscha
N: -
P: -
N: -
P: Lot of experience within the   university: in line with the TU technical problems Adding these different   compounds make it a very round and comprehensive project
Ramon
N: Simple, small project for 9 people
P: Nice presentation in the end
N: Keeps everyone busy allot
P: Will keep everyone busy, if you   finish early you could continue with “the rest”
