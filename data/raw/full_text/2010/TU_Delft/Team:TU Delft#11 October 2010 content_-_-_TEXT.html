Safety Course
Thias putting out a gas fire with an CO2 extinguisher!
This morning we all attended the Biotechnology Department Safety Instructions. Except for Jelmer, who brought cake instead! We learned all the safety instructions again and got the chance to put out a fire ourselves.
We now feel a lot safer in the lab :)
