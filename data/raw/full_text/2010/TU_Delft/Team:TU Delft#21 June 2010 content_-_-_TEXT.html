Lab work
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Restriction digestion of plasmid backbone pSB1T3.

Sample
Enzyme 1
Enzyme 2
Buffer
BSA
Needed fragment

1.0 μg pSB1T3
EcoRI
PstI
H (Roche)
✗
‘E–linear pSB1T3–P’
In stead of 10 U/μL restriction enzyme we used 1 U/μL. The digested pSB1T3 was cut from gel and isolate the band.  However, the gel extraction kit didn’t work as well as we had hoped, it turned out to be the DNA disappearing kit. Tomorrow a new day.
