Alkane Degradation
PCR Amplification
Yesterday's were ligation mixes were amplified with the primers PCR F and PCR R. The product was put on 1% agarose gel :

Alkane Sensing, Solvent Tolerance and Salt Tolerance
by Pieter
I tried to assemble the remaining biobricks from various sub projects. The goal is to assemble the following:
AlkS + E0240
PalkB + J06702
J61101 + bbc1
J61101 + PhPFDalpha
J61101 + PhPFDbeta
To achieve this J06702, bbc1, PhPFDalpha and PhPFDbeta were amplified by PCR. The J61101 was cut open with S and P after which the biobricks were inserted. AlkS was inserted in the backbone with E0240.
PCR
The PCR protocol was followed for the amplification of the BioBricks.
