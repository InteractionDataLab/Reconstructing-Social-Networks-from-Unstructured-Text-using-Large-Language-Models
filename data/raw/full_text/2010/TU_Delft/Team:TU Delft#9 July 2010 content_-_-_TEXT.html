Lab work
Ordered DNA stocks
Ramon and Eva are performing Qiagen Maxi-prep plasmid isolation of ordered DNA parts .
The following plasmid concentrations were obtained:
DNA part
Concentration (ng/μL)
alkB2
147.3
ruBA3
63.6
rubA4
29.0
rubR
26.7
ladA
5011.2
ADH
178.8
ALDH
24.1
bbc1
5.5
AlnA
357.4
OprG
197.3
AlkS
510.8
PalkB
61.5
PalkS1-2
60.9
P(Caif)
9.7
PhPFDα
147.0
PhPFDβ
56.7
rubA4, rubR, ALDH, bbc1 and P(Caif) have a low concentration, so we going to repeat the plasmid isolation of these samples.
