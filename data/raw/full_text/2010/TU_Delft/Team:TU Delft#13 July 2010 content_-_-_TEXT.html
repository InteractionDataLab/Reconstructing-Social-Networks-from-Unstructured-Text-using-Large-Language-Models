Ordered DNA
We have now stock of the ordered DNA, to make a real BioBrick of this DNA we are going to ligated it into the iGEM plasmid backbone SB1C3. First we digested the plasmids:

Emulsifier
Today the digestion products from yesterday were run on gel to see whether the plasmids were cut in the right way.
1 % agarose of digestion check. Gel runned 1 hour at 100 V. Of all samples 10 μL + 2 μL loadingbuffer was loaded and 5 μL was loaded of marker

The ligation products that were incubated over night were transformed to Top10 competent cells according to the protocol .
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
The first attempt at measuring fluorescence was made in adherence with the protocol proposed by the USTC team of 2009:
1. The overnight cultures of E.coli Top10 carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 and I13401 (LB, 37 ℃, 160 rpm) were measured for OD600 (see table below) and diluted 1:100.

K398503
1.414
K398504
1.552
I13401
1.451
2. 100 μL and 300 μL aliquots of the diluted cultures were pipetted into 96-well plates in three-fold.
3. The plate was incubated at 37 ℃ while shaking for 3 hours.
4. The fluorescence and OD600 were measured for 16.30 hours with intervals 10 minutes by means of the Biotek Synergy plate reader with the excitation filter set at 485nm and the emission filter at 520nm. LB medium was used as blank reference.
Note: surprisingly no over night growth of the cultures was observed in M9 minimal medium containing glucose. This a larger volume of inoculate (in LB) was used for a second stab at over night growth in M9.
Plasmid purification of overnight cultures carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 in pSB1A3 was performed using the Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid isolation kit yielding sufficient plasmid DNA. These BioBricks can in future be placed under control of a low to medium copy number plasmid for comparison with high copy-number plasmid expression.
