Groningen Team
Today three members had an appointment with one of the professors at our department. We heard of this and invited them to come over to meet each other.
Lab Work
Alkane Sensing, Solvent Tolerance and Salt Tolerance
The plates containing yesterday's ligations contained colonies, to check whether they really contain the desired BioBrick a colony PCR was done, and the used colonies were grown in liquid LB medium over night. The results from the PCR were analysed on a 1% agarose gel.

Alkane degradation
Colony PCR
The morning started with a gel checking the PCR products of the one BioBrick that didn't give positives yesterday . This gel showed one positive, but when I centrifuged the cells, they gave a red pellet. This indicated that the plasmid unfortunately was not the desired BioBrick, but the original destination plasmid, so we'll have to try again.

Plasmid Isolation
Of the colonies which gave a positive PCR yesterday , the plasmids were isolated using a QIA-gen miniprep kit. The following concentrations were obtained:

021K (2)
J61107-ALDH-B0015
12.9
For some reason the 021K plasmid simply didn't want to be purified. All three of the isolates had a very low concentration. Next week we'll try another plasmid isolation method and see if that works.
Digestion
A few of the plasmids just isolated were digested:

Transformations
With the ligation mixes we transformed Top10 competent cells, and grew them overnight on solid LB plates.
