Whereas the protein production in <I>E. coli</I> 029A is barely visible. From this result we can conclude that overproduction is not necessary in order to obtain biological activity. From an overproduction of the enzyme the improvement is just 9% of the <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> activity. This could mean that there is protein biologically inactive, which is just a waste of cellular resources.

However, it is clear from the statistical analysis performed that the expression of the biobrick <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398006" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398006</A> under the promoter-rbs combination <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J23100</A>-<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J61117</A> increases the dodecanal dehydrogenase activity in <I>E. coli</I> cell extracts 2-fold; whereas the expression of the same protein using the part <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J13002</A> as promoter-rbs combo increases the same activity 3-fold. Moreover, the enzymatic activities measured for the constructs <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398029" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398029</A> and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398030" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398030</A> were equivalent to 33.98% and 42.01% of the <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, respectively.  
</P><P>In our resting cell experiment, apparently there is a decrease of the octanal peak, which may be due to the biological activity of our construct. However, it was not possible to see the formation of the expected product: octanoic acid. Other experiments like more resting cell assays (analyzing intracellular metabolites) or the use of C13 marked octanal may be useful in order to confirm and measure the <I>in vivo</I> biological activity of these parts.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:602px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Comparison of ALDH activities in the different strains tested in this study</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><UL><LI>From the work published by Kato and co-workers in 2010 <A href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/214116w7482469g0/fulltext.pdf" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>, we knew that the purified enzyme has an activity equal to 0.63 U/mg, and according to the same study the tetradecanal dehydrogenase activity is 73 times higher than the octanal dehydrogenase; from the figure 5a of the cited paper we inferred that the dodecanal dehydrogenase activity is around 50% of the tetradecanal activity. Thus, the dodecanal dehydrogenase should be around 36.5 times the activity of octanal dehydrogenase which gives 22.995 U/mg pure ALDH. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>The same number expressed in kat/mg equals to 4e-7 kat/mg pure ALDH. Our cell extracts have dodecanal dehydrogenase activities of 2.15e-10 kat/mg protein cell extract (029A) and 2.67 e-10 kat/mg protein cell extract (030A). If we substract the normal <I>E. coli</I> activity, the net activities given by our biobricks are 1.301e-10 kat/mg protein cell extract (029A) and 1.812e-10kat/mg protein cell extract (030A). Which means that our strains had produced 3.253e-4 mg pure ALDH/mg protein cell extract (029A) and 4.53e-4 mg pure ALDH/mg protein cell extract (030A), respectively. Assuming a 70%(w/w) of protein content in <I>E. coli</I>, that means that a strain carrying pSB1A2 with the biobricks <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398030" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398030</A> and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398029" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398029</A> will produce 0.0317% (w/w) and 0.0228% (w/w) of their total weight as ALDH protein. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>From the expression profile, we saw that the strain <I>E. coli</I> 029A produces less ALDH protein; however, the activity is comparable to the strain <I>E. coli</I> 030A which over produces ALDH, this means that the strain 029A spends more efficiently its cell resources and produces a highly active ALDH protein.
</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="About_our_project_and_RBS_characterization_.28link_between_projects.29"> About our project and RBS characterization (link between projects)</SPAN></H4><UL><LI>Originally, we decided to characterize the Anderson promoter family because we wanted to functionally express our proteins without stressing our cells. So far, with the biobrick <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398029" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398029</A> we achieved an <I>in vitro</I> activity close to 34% of the activity reported for a natural alkane-degrading bateria. If someone else proves that our biobrick has the expected biological activity then that would mean that our design was successful. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Nowadays, WE, as Synthetic Biologists, have the challenge of starting to produce parts that are being expressed in cells in the exact amount in order to confer biological activity. Over-expression (the standard protein expression method so far) is equal to waste; cells invest most of their resources for protein production (stressing the cells <A href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/69k0pcbyc4l2qmfx/" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A>); moreover, the production of inclusion bodies (aggregates of inactive protein) is reported when there is a high over-expression level <A href="http://mbel.kaist.ac.kr/lab/research/protein_en1.html" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[3]</A>. This means that high levels of protein over-expression will give as output large quantities of protein without biological function. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>With this project, we wanted to give other teams an insight about how much of specific proteins should be expressed in a cell in order to confer biological activity. Questions that arose at the beginning of our project were: How much of a protein should be expressed in order to have biological activity? Which promoter-rbs combo should be used in order to achieve a successful expression of a biologically active protein?. During the design phase (first two months), we didn't find answers to these questions and we decided to take the initiative and give the first steps towards finding answers to our questions. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>Some people may think that we didn't succeed on proving that our biobricks confer biological activity, however we feel that with this study we are giving the first steps on the way of engineering pathways using standard parts and rational expression of proteins. Some numbers about biologically active protein were given, in order to confirm our statements more studies are required and we suggest to use <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398029" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398029</A> as a starting point, ADH (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398018" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K398018</A>) is also a nice starting point because we confirmed that has biological activity; however its performance is really mediocre compared to a natural oil-degrading bacteria as <I>Pseudomonas putida</I>.
</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_would_we_measure_if_we_had_more_time_for_this_project.3F"> What would we measure if we had more time for this project? </SPAN></H4><P><B><I>In vivo</I> activity tests:</B> A comparison of <I>in vitro</I> activities maybe it is not interesting from the functional point of view, since those differences could be related to substrate affinity or discrepancies in the optimal pH. C13-labeled Dodecanal degradation measurements or resting cell assays or other kinds of studies are required in order to prove the <I>in vivo</I> activity of our proteins.
</P><P><B>Fraction of Bt-ALDH expressed compared to the total amount of protein in the cell.</B> We inferred the amount of ACTIVE Bt-ALDH in our cell extract, however this number is not accurate until we can measure the total amount of Bt-ALDH in the recombinant strain.
</P><P><B>Expression of Bt-ALDH using other promoter-rbs combo.</B> This will give us an insight about the optimum promoter-rbs combo required for the highest possible activity without causing cell stress.
</P><P>If someone else reports that our numbers and statements are correct, then they will confirm by the very first time in the iGEM competition the amount of protein required for successful expression of an <I>in vivo</I> biologically active enzyme. We will look forward for anyone willing to do this job on 2011 ;-)
