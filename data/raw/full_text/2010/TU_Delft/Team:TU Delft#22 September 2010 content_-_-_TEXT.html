2 Alkane degradation
Emulsifier
The K12 cultures were grown over night on M9. We tried to do 2 experiments today. One for getting samples for a protein gel and another one for samples for the emulsifier assay.
Protein gel
One 50 mL tube with 10 mL M9 + Glucose was inocculated with K12 that was transformed with 206. Once the OD600 was 0.6 the protein production was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. Samples were taken every hour, for 4 hours and over night.

0.5 mL samples were taken, spinned down, and the sup and pellet were stored at -20.
Emulsifier assay
The experiment was done in triplo. 50 mL tubes were filled with 10 mL M9 + glucose and inocculated. Once OD600 was 0.6 the protein production was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM.
1 mL samples were taken at T=0, 2 and 4.
The samples were immediately subjected to the emulsifier assay with Sudan II.

Alkane degradation
Pieter was so kind to isolate the 028 plasmids from the 5 positives of yesterday. Cellbanks were also made, and competent K12 cells were transformed.
