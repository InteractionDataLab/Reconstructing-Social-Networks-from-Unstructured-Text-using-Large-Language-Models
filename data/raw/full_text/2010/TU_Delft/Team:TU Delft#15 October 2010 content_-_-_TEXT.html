Emulsifier
The goal of today was to induce the emulsifier production with IPTG in large cultures (1 L each) during the exponential growth phase. The cultures were grown at 30 C and 37 C because Esengul suggested that IPTG induction works better at a lower temperature.
IPTG was added when the cultures reached an OD600 of about 0.1.
The protein isolation was started when the 37 C cultures reached and OD600 of approximately 0.6. After centrifugating 10' at 10.000 x g the cell free supernatant and the pellet were stored in the -20 C. The isolation protocol will be continued on monday.
