Lab work
Alkane Sensing, Solvent Tolerance and Salt Tolerance
This weekend Eva and Pieter were brave enough to go to the lab this weekend. We did some simple transformations.
10 μL of ligation mixes of last friday were transformed Top10 competent cells, and these were grown on LB-plates with antibiotic over night.
