Suits
The first custom made suits arrived from our sponsor SuitSupply. We're going to look awesome during the Jamboree.
Lab work
In the lab things are also getting started: Thias, Hugo and Pieter worked on preparation of the Top10 competent cells . These will be our workhorses for the next couple of weeks.

DNA order
Aljoscha signing the DNA order
After the relaxing jam session of yesterday, we all head back to the lab/office. Besides planning the trip to Paris workshop for this weekend, we also spend some time on setting up the first transformations. Also new possible sponsors are addressed. We are still on the hunt!
The ordering invoice for the DNA synthesis are signed and on their way to Mr Gene. Of course we added their logo to our webpages igemtudelft.nl and Facebook and Twitter . And all team members have become fans on the network sites.
Lab work
Antibiotica stocks
Hugo, Ramon and Pieter made the antibiotic stock solutions. Though it is kinda hard to solubilize Chloramphenicol in water. Fortunately we have Hugo, the vortexman, on our team!
BioBrick stocks
We suspended some BioBricks from the distribution plate that we are planning to use in our project. Some of the BioBricks contain RFP. The red colour in our epps really looked nice! De BioBricks that we suspended were:
pSB1A3
pSB1K3
pSB1T3
pSB1C3
pSB3T5
pSB3C5
I13401
B0015

The concentration of the suspended BioBricks is not sufficient for all our plans. To make more plasmid, we are going to transform the BioBricks, grow colonies and isolate the plasmid.
Thias is also preparing for PCR amplification of a few biobricks. Esengül explained the mysteries of the magnificant PCR machines.

Pieter just got a little present from Mariska van Ham :-) He's so happy with is eppy!
Today Nadine & Luke are learning how to work with HTML.
Lab work
BioBrick stocks
A number of Biobricks from the DNA distribution plates were suspended yesterday . Hugo and Kira did a transformation with 2 μL of the following BioBricks (antibiotic):
pSB3T5 (Tetracycline)
pSB1T3 (Tetracycline)
pSB1C3 (Chloramphenicol)
pSB3C5 (Chloramphenicol)
pSB1K3 (Kanamycin)
pSB1A3 (Ampicillin)
I13401 (Ampicillin)
Because our own competent cells were not good enough we used commercially available competent Top10 cells (Invitrogen). The cells were plated on LB-agar with the appropriate antibiotic. Biobricks plated  We will have to wait until tomorrow to see if they were successful or not. Hopefully we will see some colonies tomorrow. Wish us luck!
Thias PCRed some BioBricks with various primer concentrations and at different temperatures to see which PCR method would work best. The PCR products were tested on a gel, and we saw a difference between the primer concentrations and the temperatures used.
Media and Solutions
By Hugo
Nadine and I are planing to revive our Ps. putida strain (muahaha). So, we prepared some solid media for that purpose: LB agar and E2 agar.
For LB medium this is the recipe that we use:
Tryptone         10g
Yeast extract   5 g
NaCl                10 g
Agar               15 g
Water, as much as you need for 1 L of culture medium
For E2 medium this is the recipe that we use:
(NH4)2HPO4  10   g
K2HPO4            5   g
Na2SO4            0.5g
1 ml of MT stock solution
1 ml of 1M MgSO4
Water, as much as you need for 1 L of culture medium
If you want to prepare the solid medium, add 15 g of agar per liter of medium.
This medium is really minimal, you can choose your own carbon source. Some literature recommend to use citrate, glucose, glycerol and, for our case, hydrocarbons. E2 medium is not complete without the following solution:
MT stock solution
FeSO4 7H2O        2.8 g
MnCl2                  0.19g
CoCl2 6H2O        2.8 g
CaCl2 4H2O         1.84g
ZnSO4 7H2O      0.28 g
CuSO4                 0.16g
WARNING: Dear iGEM people be aware that the original E2 composition is the following (Lageveen et al., 1988):
KH2PO4 3.7 g
K2HPO4 7.5 g
NaNH4HPO4.4H2O 3.5 g
Citrate 5 g / 12 g
1 M MgSO4 . 7H2O 1 ml
MT stock solution 1 ml
and the original MT stock solution composition is:
FeSO4.7H2O 2.8 g
MnSO4.H2O 2 g
CoCl2.6H2O 2.8 g
CaCl2.2H2O  1.48 g
ZnSO4.7H2O 0.28 g
CuCl2.2H2O 0.16 g
Why did we change the medium?
First, we lack of the weird salt NaNH4HPO4.4H2O, we want to save some money by making some engineering in the culture medium. Instead of the main salts for E2 we are using the salts recommended by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in the optimal medium for Ps. putida, this mineral medium is also known as P1. Find the original medium composition here .
Second, we decided to keep the MT stock solution because, alkB2 (one of our biobricks) requires certain minerals. Without this cofactors the protein won't work, however we lack of CuCl2 and MnSO4. So, we changed those salts for CuSO4 and MnCl2, we kept the molarity of the ions Cu+2 and Mn+2 (we made calculations and everything!). With these changes we hope to save some money and keep the richness of the medium intact (ish).
Lab work
BioBrick stocks
We got the first colonies, and they're red! Hurray!
Yesterday we grew colonies containing the vector backbones (which contain RFP). Today one colony from each plate was picked and cultivated in liquid (4 mL LB + 4 μL antibiotic) as well as solid LB medium (+20 μL antibiotic) with the corresponding antibiotic to grow overnight.
Thias purified the PCR products.
Red colonies
Strain Characterization
By Hugo
Today we tried to revive our strain. We added some water to the lyophilized powder. And we plated some microliters (100 ul) from the dispersion obtained on LB agar, E2 agar with octane and E2 with glucose. Let's hope for the best!. Growing temperature: 30º C
Lab work
BioBrick stocks
Today we performed a Qiagen Mini-prep plasmid isolation of the vectors we grew overnight. We saved 3 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks .
The following plasmid concentrations were obtained:

Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Next to that we also started digesting the first parts we will be characterizing.
Strain Characterization
By Hugo
I prepared the cell bank according to the following procedure:
Spin 5 ml of the overnight culture
Add 500 ul of LB medium
Add 500 ul of 80% glycerol
Store the tube at -80ºC
Now, we have a cell bank ready to be used!!!
Spring Workshop
Almost the whole team left for the iGEM spring workshop in Évry, Paris. The drive for some of us was a bit laborious (traffic jams at the middle of the night/closed roads etc.), and others actually watched the World Cup soccer match... But in the end we all arrived at the hotel in Évry little before 2 AM, Saturday morning, and got some well deserved sleep.

Cleaning
After all the media attention, we had a nice slow day. We finished some small experiments and reorganized our iGEM room. We hide all the stuff from last years team in a closet so now our room is nice and tidy.
We also booked a hotel in Boston!

In stead of 10 U/μL restriction enzyme we used 1 U/μL. The digested pSB1T3 was cut from gel and isolate the band.  However, the gel extraction kit didn’t work as well as we had hoped, it turned out to be the DNA disappearing kit. Tomorrow a new day.
Lab work
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
We tried to compensate for yesterdays delays. Thias performed a PCR reaction on short BioBrick inserts of J61100, J61101, J61107, J61117, J61127 and B0034. We wanted to investigate if this would save time in the long-run compared to transforming and plasmid isolation. The PCR reaction was run at varying annealing temperatures to figure out which temperature gave the best result.
After analysis on gel we deduced that a temperature of 50 °C was optimal.
At the end of the day we performed a Restriction digestion reaction on the amplified PCR products as well as the previously isolated I13401 and pSB3C5:

Quote of the Day
"Sometimes turtles can turn into ninjas!"  -Luke and Ramon playing chess way too defensive
World Championship
We finished our experiments before 16.00 h, so we could watch the game in our iGEM office. Go Orange! Stop sound
Lab work
We are a bit short handed in the lab this week, because most team members have exams. Considering the fine weather outside, it is not bad to have a slow week.
BioBrick stocks
All the transformations of yesterday containing BioBricks form the distribution plate gave colonies. We pick a colony of every plate and grow them overnight in 50 mL LB medium containing Ampicillin.
Pseudomonas Putida GPO1
Today we cultivated Pseudomonas Putida GPO1 on different substrates to test on what carbon source it can grow:
1. E2 medium without carbon source
2. E2 medium + 1% LB
3. E2 medium + 10% LB
4. E2 medium + 1% octane
5. E2 medium + 10% octane

To prepare for the fluorescence assay measurements the strains were grown in 3 mL LB medium containing 100 μg/mL AMP as well as in M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% glucose and 100 μg/mL AMP.
High copy number RBS characterizations are rarely indicative of RiPS in system operation plasmids, thus we are planning to also measure the fluorescence assays with the BioBricks on pSB3C5. In order to obtain sufficient BioBrick DNA the strains were grown in 250 mL LB with 100 μg/mL Ampicillin, awaiting plasmid isolation and plasmid swapping.
Emulsifier
The bricks for emulsifier production were assembled. The stock plasmids containing AlnA, OprG, R0011 and B0032 were digested and ligated into plasmid pSB1T3.
Digested were performed according to the digestion protocol :

The ligation products that were incubated over night were transformed to Top10 competent cells according to the protocol .
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
The first attempt at measuring fluorescence was made in adherence with the protocol proposed by the USTC team of 2009:
1. The overnight cultures of E.coli Top10 carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 and I13401 (LB, 37 ℃, 160 rpm) were measured for OD600 (see table below) and diluted 1:100.

2. 100 μL and 300 μL aliquots of the diluted cultures were pipetted into 96-well plates in three-fold.
3. The plate was incubated at 37 ℃ while shaking for 3 hours.
4. The fluorescence and OD600 were measured for 16.30 hours with intervals 10 minutes by means of the Biotek Synergy plate reader with the excitation filter set at 485nm and the emission filter at 520nm. LB medium was used as blank reference.
Note: surprisingly no over night growth of the cultures was observed in M9 minimal medium containing glucose. This a larger volume of inoculate (in LB) was used for a second stab at over night growth in M9.
Plasmid purification of overnight cultures carrying K398500, K398501, K398502, K398503, K398504 in pSB1A3 was performed using the Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid isolation kit yielding sufficient plasmid DNA. These BioBricks can in future be placed under control of a low to medium copy number plasmid for comparison with high copy-number plasmid expression.
