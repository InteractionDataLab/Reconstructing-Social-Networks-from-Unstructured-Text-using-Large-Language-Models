Brainstorm
The key to a succesfull iGEM project is chosing the right subject. It took us from March until early May to decide which idea suited us best. We considered everything from bacterial eyes to plastic soup, and riboswitches to exhaled breath analysis. Our final idea was based on the current events at that time: the BP oil spill.
Hugo's Risk Scale
We used the Hugo Risk Scale (HRS) to determine whether an idea was feasible or not.
Risk is represented with a value from 0 (no risk) to 10 (very risky)
Lac operon (or other piece of cake) + our biobrick
Less than 5 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
Less than 10 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
Biobrick engineering <5, improvement of things already done
Multi biobrick engineering >5, improvement of things already done
Site directed mutagenesis of several genes, results unknown a priori
Evolutionary engineering involved = sequencing
Protein engineering involved, results unknown a priori
A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), known genes in other species and characterized. Stress, social friction
A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), Known genes in other species, not fully characterized. Start a project one-eyed = stress, social friction, high chances of collapse
A lot of genes (>20), Unknown genes= characterization + sequencing + cloning. Start a project from nothing or partially blind, team-member losses + obituraries. Good side: paper in Nature and/or Nobel prize
