Our team & Nanopodium
Nanopodium is a platform for exchanging thoughts, ideas, opinions and best practices on nanotechnology. The aim is to stimulate a public dialogue about the opportunities and threats of nanotechnology and resulting applications with regard to individuals and society as a whole. Nanopodium is an initiative of the independent Committee for the Societal Dialogue on Nanotechnology in the Netherlands (CMDN).
Nano Podium Video Hunt is a campaign started with Hyves were young people are challenged to post videos about their views on nanotechnology. iGEM has also contributed to this project by producing a nice video about our project in cooperation with Nanopodium. Watch here with English subtitles).
