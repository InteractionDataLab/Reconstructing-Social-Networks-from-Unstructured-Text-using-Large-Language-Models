Hugo's Risk Scale
Our own standard for project risk assessment. Risk is represented with a value from 0 (no risk) to 10 (very risky)
0: Lac operon (or other piece of cake) + our biobrick
1: Less than 5 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
2: Less than 10 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
3: Biobrick engineering <5, improvement of things already done
4: Multi biobrick engineering >5, improvement of things already done
5: Site directed mutagenesis of several genes, results unknown a priori
6: Evolutionary engineering involved = sequencing
7: Protein engineering involved, results unknown a priori
8: A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), known genes in other species and characterized. Stress, social friction
9: A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), Known genes in other species, not fully characterized. Start a project one-eyed = stress, social friction, high chances of collapse
10: A lot of genes (>20), Unknown genes= characterization + sequencing + cloning. Start a project from nothing or partially blind, team-member losses + obituraries. Good side: paper in Nature or Nobel
