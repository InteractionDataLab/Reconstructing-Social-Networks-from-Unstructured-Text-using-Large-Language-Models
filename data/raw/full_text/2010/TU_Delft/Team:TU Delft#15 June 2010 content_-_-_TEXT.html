Media Flood
The plan was to make another batch of competent cells today. Instead, we were flooded by media attention. Apparently, our PR efforts are paying off. Oil degradation is hot :) The complete day we were running around, finding the persons involved to get permission for a camera crew in the lab. Finally at the end of the day after like fifty phone call, everybody was accord. We can hardly wait for our big TV debut tomorrow.
