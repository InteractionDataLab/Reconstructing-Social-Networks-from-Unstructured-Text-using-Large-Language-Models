Our self developed workshop was succesfully used at the <A href="http://www.wtacademie.nl/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Science Day for Teachers</A> and at the <A href="http://www.delft.nl/content.jsp?objectid=51425" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Science Day for Kids</A>. The goal was to inspire and fascinate teachers. People already interested in science were challenged to see even more the opportunities that science and technology can offer.

They are offered the opportunity to join our team and built their own BioBrick for oil degradation. But before we let them tinker with DNA parts, we give a short introduction into the building blocks of life. Then they have to roll up their sleeves! 
</P><P>Participants are provided with a Parts Registry and a modular of parts in the form of cards. In this way, they were challenged to think about how the various parts have to be combined.

According to most, the application of this science should not only be in the hands of commerce. On the other hand, it was suggested that is not a good idea to only let the society decide on its fate. Fear of the unknown is a major challenge for many people. By being afraid of what may or may not happen, people could reject scientific advances.
