World Championship
Barely recovered from the Spring Workshop, we are already full of adrenaline again! Today the orange dressed team is going to play against Denmark. The lab is closed from 13:30 to 15:00 :) After watching the first half of the game in 't Keldertje, we set up a monitor on our iGEM room to watch the stream.
Hup Holland! Stop sound
