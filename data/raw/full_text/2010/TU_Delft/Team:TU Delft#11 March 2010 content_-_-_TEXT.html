Team:TU Delft/11 March 2010 content
From 2010.igem.org
First Meeting
Today all that applied to be a part of the iGEM competition representing the TU Delft got together for the first time. In total we have got 9 interested students, 2 instructors and 2 advisers. We started by introducing ourselves and talked about what we thought were the most interesting past iGEM projects. It turned out that we really liked the ideas concerning a sensor of some sort, which was coupled to an output (to put in very generally). Furthermore we discussed some does and don'ts for an iGEM project, such that it would be smartest to have and idea that can be split up into parts, and we made plans for a next meeting, which will be out first brainstorming session.
