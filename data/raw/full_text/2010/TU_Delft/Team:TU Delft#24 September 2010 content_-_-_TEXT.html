From 2010.igem.org
Alkane degradation
Today we did a DLT to make 014 (011+028=>alkB2 gene cluster), 022 (017+026=>ladA, ADH and ALDH) and 023 (027+026, same as 022 but with different promoter). The ligation mixes were used to transform commercial TOP10 cells.
No encouraging results from the resting cell assays :-( We are going to use other protocol. Maybe cell disruption and NADH measurements...
Salt tolerance
We ran an innitial test of our salt tolerance biobrick. We'll have the results on monday
