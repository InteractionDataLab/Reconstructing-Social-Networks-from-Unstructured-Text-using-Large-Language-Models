Night of the Nerds
Being a biotech nerd is not just cool, it's sexy! Tonight we went to the Night of the Nerds in Amsterdam celebrating our interest in science. And thanks to the videos we made and uploaded we got VIP tickets.
We ate flowers, saw the latest 3D printers and of course promoted Synthetic Biology. Keep checking our YouTube channel for a video report!
