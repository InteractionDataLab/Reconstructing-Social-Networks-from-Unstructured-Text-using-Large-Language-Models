Emulsifier
After the quick and dirty emulsifier of yesterday, we wanted to do some mmore extensive measurements on the isolated proteins.
Protein Concentration Determination
In order to normalize the results we measured the protein concentration using the Bradford assay.
#
Description
[Protein] (mg/ml)
K12 Control strain
19.23
K12 206 strain
15.79
Dilution Series
For determining the emulsifying capacity of the proteins we did a dilution serie experiment. All measurements were done in triplo. It clearly shows a difference between the emulsification by the proteins isolated from the 206 transformed K12 and the control.
