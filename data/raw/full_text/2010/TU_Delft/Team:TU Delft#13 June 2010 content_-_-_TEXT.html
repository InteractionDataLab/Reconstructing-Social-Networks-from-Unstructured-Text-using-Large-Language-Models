Spring Workshop - Day 2
Day two of the Europe Spring Workshop 2010. During breakfast the team talked with Randy Rettberg, who complemented us on our wiki! (we had given him our card yesterday) He actually suggested we'd give the iGEM frontpage a new look!
We got a lot of information and tips about cloning protocols and editing of the wiki. We are eager to put the learned knowlegde into action.

In the afternoon the workshop was over. So there was some time to explore Paris.
