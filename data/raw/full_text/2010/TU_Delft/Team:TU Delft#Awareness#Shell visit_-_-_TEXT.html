Shell visit
We visited Shell and met Henry van Straten (Manager Global Knowledge Centre Energy, Water, CO2) and Albert Janssen (Global R&D Coordinator Water Handling and Part-time professor Biological Gas and Water Treatment at Wageningen University). After a brief introduction on our project they gave us a lot of information about how Shell handles water throughout their production processes. With this information we can further calculate the feasability of the application of our project.
