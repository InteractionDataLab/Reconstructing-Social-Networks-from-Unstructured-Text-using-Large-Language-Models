Lab work
Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Ligations were performed using the overnight digested BioBricks . The following ligation reactions was performed:

3 μL μL ‘X–I10341–P’
1.5 μL ‘E–linear pSB1T3–P’
We adhered to the 3:1 insert:plasmid ratio when determining the volumes of DNA added. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 16 °C.
Media and solutions
By Hugo
Ramon and I prepared the DNA electrophoresis loading buffer, 10 ml of this mixture are enough for thousands of samples.
The recipe is as follows:
Compound
Amount required
Final concentration
Bromophenol blue
0.025 g
0.25% w/v
Xylene Cyanol FF
0.025 g
0.25% w/v
Ficoll (type 400: Pharmacia)
1.5 g
15% w/v
Water
As much as you need for 10 ml
WARNING: THE POWDERS ARE ELECTROSTATIC. WEAR GLOVES AND CLEAN ALL THE PLACE WITH ALCOHOL (70% v/v)... SERIOUSLY, THE BLUE STUFF IS EVERYWHERE!!!
