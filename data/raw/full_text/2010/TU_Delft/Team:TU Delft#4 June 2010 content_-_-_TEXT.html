Suits
The first custom made suits arrived from our sponsor SuitSupply. We're going to look awesome during the Jamboree.
Lab work
In the lab things are also getting started: Thias, Hugo and Pieter worked on preparation of the Top10 competent cells . These will be our workhorses for the next couple of weeks.
