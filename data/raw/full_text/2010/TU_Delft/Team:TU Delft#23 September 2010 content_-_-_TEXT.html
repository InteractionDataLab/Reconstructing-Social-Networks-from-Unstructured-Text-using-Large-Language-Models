Alkane degradation
Thias took over here, and PCRed the K12 colonies from yesterday. These were all positive.
Hugo is making some resting cell assays... we will see the outcome of them tomorrow.
George M. Church Lecture
Today we went to a lecture of George M. Church. He was rewarded the International Steven  Hoogendijk Award in Rotterdam. The title of the lecture was "How Personal Genomics and Synthetic Biology will influence healthcare". Prof. Church showed the development and the latest art of sequencing, synthesis and their application in MAGE and the PGP. Afterwards we seized the opportunity to speak with him, and discuss among others the impact of iGEM. We hope to meet him again in Boston!
