Emulsifier
Next week the plasmid with AlnA will arrive, so just to be sure I repeated the emulsifier assay which we designed to characterize the brick.
I have changed the previous setup slightly. To be brief:
Total volume 1 mL
20 uL Sudan II in EtOH
Vortex 15 sec
Rest for 1 hour
The experiment was done 4 times.
There obviously is a nice correlation between the concentration of SDS and the absorbance. Especially in het nanomolar region the distribution is almost perfectly lineair.
BioBrick migration
Today the last step of the massive BioBrick migration - plasmid isolation.
