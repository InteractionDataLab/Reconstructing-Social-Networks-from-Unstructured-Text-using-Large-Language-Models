Emulsifier
All plates contained a lot of colonies. Colony PCR was done and showed that all colonies were positive. So we let them grew on LB overnight.
Alkane degradation
Another DLT and digestion check of 028. The digestion check failed, we suspect because the inactivity of EarI. The digestion product for the DLT, as well as the check of 010 were not visible on gel. More investigation into this later. 009 and 010 were ligated to hopefully form 028. We'll see if we have colonies tomorrow...
