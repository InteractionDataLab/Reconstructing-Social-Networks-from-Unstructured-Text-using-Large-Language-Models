Lab work
Tolerance and Sensing
A new attempt to construct parts 304 (PalkS12 + B0032), 327(P(caif) + B0032) and 405 (402 + 403).
Digestion, Ligation, Transformation
1 microgram of each plasmid was digested:

So most digestions were not what we expected. The ligations were already started anyway.
Following the digestions, the fragments were ligated for 4 hours.

Alkane degradation
All of yesterday's plates contained colonies. To check whether they contain the correct insert we will do a colony PCR.

On the gel it looks like lane 9, containing 013K, has the correct length. We will do a plasmid isolation tomorrow. Unfortunately none of the colonies of 020A seemed to be correct. We will check some more colonies with a colony PCR overnight.
