Protocols
Use of provided BioBricks
From the iGEM organization each team has received a distribution kit containing selected biobricks from the previous years. These biobricks are provided in three 384 well plates containing dried DNA with which competent cells can transformed.
The biobricks are supplied as the DNA in a plasmid with a certain antibiotic resistance, which is denoted by a letter in the plasmid name. All the possible antibiotic resistances that are used within the Biobrick standard are ampicillin (A), chloramphenicol (C), erythromycin (E), gentamycin (G), kanamycin (K), neomycin (N), nalidixic acid (Na), rifampicin (R), spectinomycin (S), streptomycin (St), tetracycline (T), trimethoprim (Tm) and zeocin (Z).
Before use, the dried DNA must be resuspended. This protocol is based on Part registry

QIAGEN Mini-prep plasmid isolation
This protocol is based on QIAGEN® Plasmid Purification Handbook.
This protocol is designed for preparation of up to 20 µg of high-copy plasmid or cosmid DNA using the Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit. Qiagen plasmid isolation is used to obtain very pure plasmid DNA.
Maximum recommended culture volumes for the Qiagen-tip 20:
High-copy plasmids    1-5 mL
Materials:
bacterial culture
Qiagen colums
buffer P1 (100 μg/mL RNAse A, 50 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0)
buffer P2 (200 mM NaOH, 1% SDS)
buffer P3 (3 M KAc, pH 5.5)
buffer PE
milliQ pH 8.0
centrifuge
nanodrop
Protocol:
Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate and inoculate a starter culture of 2–5 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for approximately 8 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking (approx. 300 rpm)
Harvest the 5 mL bacterial cells by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min at 20°C (microcentrifuge tube). If you wish to stop the protocol and continue later, freeze the cell pellets at –20°C
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μL Buffer P1. Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1. No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. Mix gently by inverting the tube. Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 minutes.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer N3. Large culture volumes (e.g. ≥5 mL) may require inverting up to 10 times. The solution should become cloudy.
Incubate at -20 °C for 15 minutes.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in a table-top microcentrifuge. A compact white pellet will form.
Apply the supernatants from step 7 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30–60 seconds. Discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 seconds.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. Important: Residual wash buffer will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. Residual ethanol from Buffer PE may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 30 μL Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 minute, and centrifuge for 1 minute.

QIAGEN Gel Extraction
This protocol is based on QIAGEN® Gel Extraction Handbook.
Materials:
QIAquick columns
buffer QG
buffer PE
isopropanol
milliQ
microcentrifuge
heat block at 50 °C
Protocol:
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel. Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μL). For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes of Buffer QG. The maximum amount of gel slice per QIAquick column is 400 mg; for gel slices >400 mg use more than one QIAquick column.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation. IMPORTANT: Solubilize agarose completely. For >2% gels, increase incubation time.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μL of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow. The adsorption of DNA to the QIAquick membrane is efficient only at pH <7.5. Buffer QG contains a pH indicator which is yellow at pH <7.5 and orange or violet at higher pH, allowing easy determination of the optimal pH for DNA binding.
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix. This step increases the yield of DNA fragments <500 bp and >4 kb. For DNA fragments between 500 bp and 4 kb, addition of isopropanol has no effect on yield. Do not centrifuge the sample at this stage.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 min. The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 μL. For sample volumes of more than 800 μL, simply load and spin again.
Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
To wash, add 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 10,000 x g (~13,000 rpm). IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μL of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or H2O to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min at maximum speed. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. Important: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volume is 48 μL from 50 μL elution buffer volume, and 28 μL from 30 μL. Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent. The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.

100 mL glass flasks
50 mL centrifuge tubes

centrifuge
Protocol
Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate and inoculate a starter culture of 50 mL LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate at 37°C, 160 rpm.
Chef's tips and tricks:
You can also inoculate directly from your cell bank (cell stock with glycerol 40%v/v in fresh medium). Then you can start with a previous overnight culture (5 mL) and then inoculate 50 mL of fresh medium with 1 mL, in that way you will reach your desired OD around 2-3 hours you started the culture.
Normally, we use 5 μL to inoculate 5 mL. Some people may think that this is a lot, specially because of the fact that cells are concentrated in the cell bank. .But, when we used a different amount we had some nasty surprises like no overnight growth. Spin down the cultures at an OD of +/- 0.6 in 50 mL tubes for 10 min at 4.000 rpm using a chilled (4 °C) centrifuge.
Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of 50 mM Tris buffer (with the appropriate pH) and keep on ice until sonication.
Chef's tips and tricks:
Sometimes we use a washing step, specially when we want to prepare a extract of 100 mL of culture (2 flasks of 50 mL). Then after you resuspend your cells, spin them down and resuspend them again. If you think that this could be futile check the amount of LB remaining next your cells, it's around 200 μL. Just in case you don't want this extra source of pH disturbance, you can do this washing step before you kill your cells.
Sonicate the suspension (placing the tip as close as possible to the bottom of the tube, without touching) for 3 minutes at a 40% duty cycle and an output control of 4; all the while keeping the suspension on ice.
Chef's tips and tricks:
BE CAREFUL, place the tip of your sonicator in the middle of your tube next to the bottom, but not touching the tube otherwise you can break it. If you place the tip somewhere else, you will end up with a nice E. coli milkshake with zero acitivity. Presence of a lot of foam during the disruption is bad sign; that nice foam it's mainly denaturated protein. So please, BE CAREFUL.
You need ice all the time. Sonication produces a lot of heat, if you have a heat sensitive protein or you don't want to mess up with you negative control (E. coli), then KEEP YOUR CELL SUSPENTION ALL THE TIME ON ICE.
If you see a nice reduction of O.D. by naked eye inspection, then you are in the good way. If that's not the case you can give to the cell suspension some extra minutes (1 or 2) in the sonicator. There should be a nice difference between disrupted cells and normal cell suspension. Disrupted cells produce a transparent(ish) suspension, whereas normal cells have a milky aspect.
Spin down the suspension for 5 minutes at 4.000 rpm in a chilled centrifuge.
Chef's tips and tricks:
You can see a nice reduction of you cell pellet, and that could be use as a criterion for keep on going with your experiments, sometimes the reduction of the pellet is not that considerable but you may see a viscous supernatant (compared to your buffer). That's a sign of a nice disruption; if you cannot see these things happening to your suspension then something went wrong. You can do an extra sonication step.
Your supernatant now contains your enzyme of interest. You can do protein determination assays. Recomendation: DON'T BE TOO GREEDY!!! If you have some protein don't do an extra sonication step in order to obtain more. If you make a mistake or you give extra energy to your extract you may lose the sample and you have to start all over again.
Evaluating
Use the following checking list in order to know if you have to do an extra disruprtion step or start all over again:
Is the pellet is smaller compared to the one obtained before disruption? If yes continue to 2.
Did the supernatant look like more viscous than water when I transfer the supernatant?If yes continue to 3.
Was the cell extract foamy (like a milkshake) before the last centrifugation? If yes, go to Doubtful results and pray, continue to 4.
Do the bradford or protein analysis results show that I have more signal in my disruption cells than in the control (buffer)? If yes go to Successful disruption and smile, if not go to Extra step and cry if you feel like that.
Troubleshooting
Extra step: Your disruption went really wrong, repeat the sonication step and use the checklist again. If you still have problems (like no protein or a mediocre amount of protein) then ask the person in charge of the sonicator or someone more qualified than you to check the machine.
Doubtful results: Sometimes your activities are lower than they are in reality, which will give you a false positive in case that you want to use your protein for activity assays. If this is your first time with the protocol, don't be scared; keep going on with your tests but take into consideration the advice that YOU HAVE TO REPEAT IT in order to proof that your activities are correct. You can use two or three E. coli cultures in the same experiment, so that if you mess up with one you have other(s) ready to be used as a confirmation of your results.
Tolerance assay

Measure the growth curves using the plate reader
Alcohol/Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity assays
Materials
Cell extracts
Buffer 57 mM glycine, 1mM NAD, pH 9.5
Alcohol/Aldehyde
96 well plate
Plate reader
Protocol
Determine the protein content (mg/mL) of your cell extract. Use whatever method you prefer.
Keep your extracts on ice.
Add glycine buffer to the wells that you are going to use, usually we used 180 μL per well.
Add the alcohol/aldehyde to be tested to the appropriate wells, usually we added 5 μL. WARNING: Each well with alcohol/aldehyde MUST HAVE A CONTROL WITHOUT SUBSTRATE. Don't forget to prepare a BLANK, which will be a mixture of buffer and substrate without enzyme.
Chef's tips and tricks:
Long-chain alcohols are not in a liquid form at room temperature, keep them in some warm place before you start your assay, so that they will be melted whenever you will use them.
Warm the plate up for 10-20 min at 37ºC. Keep in mind that this is a biphasic system; therefore we need a previous step in which you let the system to reach a equilibrium. Otherwise your first measurements will be noisy and you have to extend the assay, in case that you have a really powerful enzyme that may mean that you will repeat the experiment because the NAD will dissappear very quick. In case that your enzyme is not that fast, you can skip this step and add the enzyme; if you have noisy results at the beggining of the measurement, discard them and analyze the rest (at least 20 min of analysis, preferable more than 5 data points).
Add the cell extract to your reaction mixture, usually we added 40 uL.
Measure in your plate reader at wavelength of 340 nm, it is better if you run your experiment for 1 hour or so. Try to do data acquisition each 2-3 minutes, in that way you will have more than enough data to work with.
Data analysis
Divide each data point by the extinction coefficient of NADH (6220 M^-1 cm^-1) and by the path length; in our case we had reaction volumes of 225 μL (buffer+enzyme+substrate) and 220 μL (buffer+enzyme). Each well had a length of 1 cm and a total volume of 300 μL. That means that we had path lengths of 0.75 cm and 0.7333 cm. The number that you will get is the MOLAR CONCENTRATION of NADH in you well.
Multiply the molar concentration of NADH in your well by the reaction volume in order to get the TOTAL AMOUNT OF NADH MOLES in your well.
Rest the NADH moles from the BLANK (buffer+substrate WITHOUT enzyme) to all your wells.
For each data point do the following operation: NADH moles  produced = NADH moles  (buffer+enzyme+substrate) - NADH moles (buffer+enzyme)
Plot on the x-axis the time and in the y-axis the NADH moles produced. Perform a linear regression and report the slopes (moles/min) of each well. One Unit of alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase is defined as the amount of enzyme required for producing 1 umol of NADH in one minute.
Divide the amount of Units of enzyme by the amount of TOTAL PROTEIN added to the reaction mixture. That will give you a result in U/mg of protein.
RBS characterization experiment
Materials
-80 stocks or plates of strains carrying the RBS of interest, a reference and an 'empty' plasmid
96-well plate + lid
96-well plate fluorescence + absorbance reader (BioTek Synergy)
Protocol
Inoculate 5 mL of LB+Amp with your strains of interest, reference strain (B0032) and empty plasmid strain (I13401). Do this in triplicate. Grow up o/n.
The following day subculture 2 μL of o/n culture in 200 μL of LB+Amp (1:100 dilution) on 96 well plates, all in quadruplicate (you will have 12 wells per strain now, a full row!)

pCaiF characterization experiment
Materials
-80 stocks or plates of strains carrying the biobrick BBa_K398331, a reference and an 'empty' plasmid
96-well plate + lid
96-well plate fluorescence + absorbance reader (BioTek Synergy)
Protocol
Inoculate 5 mL of M9 (10 g/L of glc) with your strains of interest and empty plasmid strain (J13002). Grow them overnight.
Chef's tips and tricks:
Be aware that normal M9 contains 2 g/L. In order to prepare this new medium we just added 5 times the specified amount of glucose for normal M9 medium.
In the next morning subculture 50 μL of o/n culture in another 5 mL of M9 (10 g/L of glc).
Check the O.D. at 600nm of the cultures after some hours (usually 3 h), if this parameter is in the range of 0.15-0.3 you can start your assay, otherwise wait until you have at least an O.D. of 0.2.
Chef's tips and tricks:
We use to check the O.D. 2 hours after we started the culture and we try to adjust the O.D. to the lowest measurement obtained, once they are in the same O.D. when they are diluted the greater are the chances that you don't have to adjust the O.D. at the end of the culture.
Pour into your plate 100 μL of fresh medium, use different glucose concentrations. You can do this by diluting your M9 medium (10g/L glc) with M9 WITHOUT glucose.
Chef's tips and tricks:
In our case we used 10 g/L, 5 g/L, 2 g/L, 1 g/L with a secondary carbon source: Laurate (final concentration of 5mM).
Add 5 μL of you culture according to your personal scheme.
Now your plate is ready to be measured! Go to your favorite plate reader and program your sample. Set the temperature to 37°C. In a kinetic loop of a fixed time (17 hour 30 mins) the following measurements are taken with a time interval of 10 minutes with CONSTANT shaking: absorbance (600 nm filter) and GFP fluorescence (485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission). Followed by a delay of 100 seconds.
Data analysis
Average you Biomass concentration for empty plasmid and your sample. Substract the blank value to your measurements.
Average the fluorescence produced by your empty plasmid and your sample. Substract the fluorescence of the empty plasmid to the fluorescence given by your strain of interest. The BLANK is already included in this operation if it is all the time lower than the fluorescence measured in your empty plasmid.
Plot the data points obtained and analyze the amount of GFP produced by your strain.

Enzyme activity assay for LadA by GC
Materials
Lysates obtained from desired strains using our sonication protocol
50mM Tris-HCL solution with a pH of 7.5
NADH,
FMN,
MgS04(*7H2O) and
Triton X-100
25 mL closed-cap flasks
Incubator at 37 °C and/or at 60 °C
Boiling water
Desired alkane (0.1% of total volume)
Protocol
Make sure all steps are performed using glassware! Alkanes may dissolve plastics.
Add 0.1% v/v of the alkane to the Tris buffer and heat in boiling water for 5 minutes. Sonicate for 1 minute while still warm until a homogenous, viscous mixture is obtained.

Enzyme activity assay for LadA by NADH absorption
Materials
Cell extracts of desired strain
Buffer 50 mM Tris containing 1mM NADH and 100nM FMN at pH 7.5
Alkane (30 μL per well of heptadecane or hexadecane)
96 well plate
Plate reader
Protocol
Keep your extracts on ice.
Add buffer to the wells that you are going to use.
Add the alkane to be tested to the appropriate wells. KEEP IN MIND: Each well with alkane MUST HAVE A CONTROL WITHOUT SUBSTRATE. Besides you must have a blank (mixture without enzyme).
Warm the plate up for 10-20 min at 37 °C (in the case of heptadecane). Keep in mind that this is a biphasic system; therefore we need a previous step in which you let the system reach an equilibrium.
Add appropriate amounts of cell extracts to the buffer. Remember you are adding cell extract to a highly reduced compound which will easily be oxidized by anything else what is present in the lysate. In order to have enough measurement point per well (before everything going to 0) you must add very small amounts of lysate. For our experiments 5 μL was sufficient to yield slopes that could be further analysed. Parallel to this we've heat shocked the lysate at 60 °C for 10 minutes. This deactivates most of the E.coli oxidoreductases and should leave LadA in its native form, thus decreasing E.coli background 'noise'.
Start absorption measurment at 340 nm immediately after adding lysates!
