Session 6
During the meeting 9 presentations were given on different possible subjects, and following the presentations the team voted on whether we should continue with the idea or not. These were the subjects, and the outcome of the vote:
- Exhaled breath analysis          Vote: Yes (6/8)
- Soil Sampling          Vote: No (2/8)
- Mosquito’s/Parasites          Vote: No (0/8)
- Cell shrinkage          Vote: No (2/8)
- Oil remediation (Hydrocarbon biodegradation)          Vote: Yes (8/8)
- Bacterial buffer          Vote: No
- Rainbow pH sensor          Vote: Yes (8/8)
- Ice melting          Vote: No (0/8)
- Biofilms (Linked to cell density measurement?)          Vote: Part of another project
- Bacterial eye          Vote: Yes (7/8)
- GMOs in the Gut          Something to add to another idea
Chosen Ideas:
- Colon cancer detection
- Oil remotion
- Rainbow pH Sensor
- Bacterial Eye
Presentation by Pieter
Hugo's Risk Scale
We used the Hugo Risk Scale (HRS) to determine whether an idea was feasible or not.
Risk is represented with a value from 0 (no risk) to 10 (very risky)
Lac operon (or other piece of cake) + our biobrick
Less than 5 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
Less than 10 genes or biobricks (copy-paste) + our biobrick
Biobrick engineering <5, improvement of things already done
Multi biobrick engineering >5, improvement of things already done
Site directed mutagenesis of several genes, results unknown a priori
Evolutionary engineering involved = sequencing
Protein engineering involved, results unknown a priori
A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), known genes in other species and characterized. Stress, social friction
A lot of genes and/or biobricks (>20), Known genes in other species, not fully characterized. Start a project one-eyed = stress, social friction, high chances of collapse
A lot of genes (>20), Unknown genes= characterization + sequencing + cloning. Start a project from nothing or partially blind, team-member losses + obituraries. Good side: paper in Nature or Nobel
