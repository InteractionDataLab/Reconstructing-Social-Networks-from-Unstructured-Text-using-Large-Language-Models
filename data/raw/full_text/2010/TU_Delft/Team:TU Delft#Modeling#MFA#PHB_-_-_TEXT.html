PHB production
In previous situations the hydrocarbons were degraded only to form biomass and CO2. It is interesting to see how much product could be made from hydrocarbons. PHB is a polymer of polyhydroxybutyrate. The production pathway of PHB is well known. PHB is a solid product which is to recover in the down stream process.
The pathway is displayed here http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY1-3&detail-level=2&detail-level=1
In this scenario the lumped PHB production pathway was added to metabolic network;
2 acetyl-CoA + NADPH -> (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA the polymerization reaction just consumes (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA.
