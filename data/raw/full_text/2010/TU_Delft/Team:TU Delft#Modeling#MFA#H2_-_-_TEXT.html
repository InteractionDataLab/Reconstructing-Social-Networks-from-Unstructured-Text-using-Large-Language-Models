hydrogen production
In previous situations the hydrocarbons were degraded only to form biomass and CO2. It is interesting to see how much product could be made from hydrocarbons. Hydrogen is considered a green fuel. Hydrogen is a volatile product and is easily separated from fermentation broth. It does however contain no carbon atoms, so hydrogen will result in production of CO2 and biomass.
The pathway is displayed here http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=REACTION&object=FHLMULTI-RXN
In this scenario the hydrogen production pathway was added to metabolic network;
Formate + H+ -> H2 + CO2
