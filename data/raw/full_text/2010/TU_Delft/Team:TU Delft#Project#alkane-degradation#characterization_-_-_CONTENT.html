The alkanes octane and dodecane were tested as possible substrates in M9 minimal medium. The protocol can be found found <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft#page=Notebook/protocols&amp;anchor=Protocol_for_growth_of_E.coli_K12_on_alkanes" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A>. The idea behind this is that <I>E.coli</I> might inherently contain an ADH and ALDH that, while it might be at an extremely low activity, can be able to degrade larger chain alkanes thus releasing energy for growth.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Resting-cell_assays">Resting-cell assays</SPAN></H4><P>As explained earlier the catalytic component of the alkane hydroxylase system is an integral membrane protein. Characterization must thus be done using an intact-membrane setup. An option which has been explored in literature [1] is the resting-cell assay a.k.a. biotransformation assay. These assays will indicate the presence or absence of the desired enzymes, regardless of the alkane’s utilization for growth. The logic behind this is to stall the growth of a large volume of cells by using nitrogen-deficient medium to test their alkane conversion capabilities at near-zero growth.
Extraction hydrocarbons from the medium using an apolar solvent (such as ethyl acetate) after the reaction and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography would indicate the presence of the corresponding alkanol and/or the decrease of alkane. For more on the experimental setup see the following pages:

By using a buffer at the appropriate pH, containing FMN and proper amounts of NADH the kinetics could easily be monitored by a 96-well plate reader. The protocol is described in detail <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft#page=Notebook/protocols&amp;anchor=Enzyme_activity_assay_for_LadA_by_NADH_absorption" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A>.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Enzyme_activity_assay_based_on_GC-analysis">Enzyme activity assay based on GC-analysis</SPAN></H4><P>The most favorable way to analyse the activity of the LadA enzyme is by creating an environment in which it can properly function in-vitro. As explained earlier the enzyme required NADH and flavin mononucleotide as cofactors. Furthermore the optimal activity was found at a temperature of 60 degrees and a pH of 7.5. In accordance with these properties a <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft#page=Notebook/protocols&amp;anchor=Enzyme_activity_assay_for_LadA_by_GC" class="external text" rel="nofollow">protocol</A> was set up for the conversion of hexadecane using the lysates of the <I>E.coli</I> cells carrying the ladA constructs. After the reaction the hydrocarbons are extracted with an apolar solvent and analysed by gas chromatography (click <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU_Delft#page=Notebook/protocols&amp;anchor=General_gas_chromatography_program_for_alkanes_and_alkanols" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A> for the GC program and the obtained GC calibration graph).

For that purpose, we used octanol-1 and dodecanol-1 for the ADH system; whereas we used octanal and dodecanal for the ALDH system.  If everything goes well, we should see microbial growth on minimal medium with these compounds as sole carbon source. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Resting_cell_assays"> Resting cell assays</SPAN></H4><P>Our second attempt was to grow cells, until the exponential phase is reached; then the cells were collected and the spent medium was changed for a buffer with glucose that lacked of N-source, this was done in order to avoid more biomass production. Additionally we added alcohols and aldehydes to the mixture, so that if our part is working they will be converted in other molecules: alcohols to aldehydes and aldehydes to alkanoic acids.
</P><P>With this approach, we are hoping that the enzymes produced during the growth phase will remain inside the cells. The glucose added will serve for maintenance purposes and co-factor regeneration. If everything works well, there will be some nice peaks appearing on our GC analysis. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="NADH_production_in_cell_extracts"> NADH production in cell extracts</SPAN></H4><P>We called this assay: THE LAST RESORT  =s 
</P><P>Basically, we grew cells until an O.D. (600nm) between 0.5-1.0. We needed chubby healthy happy exponential-growth cells because most of our constructions are meant for protein production in this growth phase. 
</P><P>Once, we got a lot of cells... we disrupted them by sonication and we analyze the NADH production by their guts using a simple spectrophotometrical analysis. If our parts are working, we should see a higher NADH production when the substrate (dodecanol-1 or dodecanal) to the buffer with microbial guts and NAD buffer. We can use this method  because NAD is the natural co-factor of our proteins. Fortunately for us, NAD reduction could be easily quantified by absorbance measurements at 340 nm.
</P><P>We called this protocol &quot;the last resort&quot; because the others didn't work. Which means that alcohols and aldehydes do not cross the cell membrane, thus in order to grow cell on these compounds as sole carbon sources... WE NEEDED TO ADD TRANSPORTERS =(
