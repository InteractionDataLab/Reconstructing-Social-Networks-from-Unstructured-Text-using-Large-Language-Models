Alkane degradation
A colony PCR was run over night, and analyzed on gel today. Of the 022 and 023 none seemed correct, but 014 showed 2 positives (#2 and #7).

Because the height of 014 was not too clear on the previous gel, the same sample was loaded again on a new gel to double check the height. The height seemed correct so the plasmids were isolated and transformed to K12 immediately.

Salt tolerance
After looking at the results we can see some effects of bbc1, but we'll need to redo it for more salt concentrations.
