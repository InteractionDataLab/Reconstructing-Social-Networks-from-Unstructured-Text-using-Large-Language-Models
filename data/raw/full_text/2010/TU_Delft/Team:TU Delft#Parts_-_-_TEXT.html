Parts
We enabled our bugs to degrade hydrocarbons using standard biological parts, also called BioBricks. These are nucleic acid-encoded molecular biological functions, along with the associated information defining and describing the parts. You can find more information about this on the website of The BioBricks Foundation .
Using these molecules any synthetic biologist or biological engineer can program living organisms. All our parts are available to anyone for free via MIT's Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
After designing the parts, we operated them in E. coli cells. The methods we used are described on the Characterization page.
