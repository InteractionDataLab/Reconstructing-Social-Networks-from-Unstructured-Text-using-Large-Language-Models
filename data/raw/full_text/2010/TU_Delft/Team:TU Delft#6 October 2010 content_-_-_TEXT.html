Alkane degradation
From the noted below it can be concluded that we have constructs 029, 017, 030. 027 showed no positive PCR.
Emulsifier
Today we isolated proteins from two cultures. One K12 culture with AlnA and one controle culture. The proteins were isolated according to the emulsifier isolation protocol. The final product was dissolved in 3 mL. Next, we did a quick emulsification assay, which has to be corrected with protein concentrations that I will measure tomorrow.
OD Measurements:
Control: 0.882
AlnA: 0.880
Absorption measured at 493 nm. SII = 20 ul Sudan II
