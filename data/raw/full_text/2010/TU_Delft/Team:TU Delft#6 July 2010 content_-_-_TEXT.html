Lab work
Ordered DNA stocks
The DNA from Mr Gene has finally arrived, now we're ready to build some biobricks!
We were so excited; we immediately dissolved the DNA in water and performed a transformation with 100 ng of the DNA and plated on the LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotic.

Characterization of Anderson RBS sequences
Yesterday's purified PCR product of I13401 and the Anderson RBS Biobricks (J61100, J61101, J61107, J61117 and J61127) were digested :

The digestion products were purified using Roche's PCR Purifiation Kit and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel for comparison with the non-digested BioBricks:
1 % agarose of digestion check. Gel runned 1 hour at 100 V. Of all samples 1 μL sample + 4 μL MQ + 1 μL loadingbuffer was loaded and 5 μL was loaded of marker

To all samples one-tenth of the total volume ligase buffer was added.
Emulsifier
Pieter is testing different condition for the emulsifying Assay. To determine the emulsifying activity we set up a calibration curve with SDS. He prepared the following samples:

Hexane (mL)
Tris Buffer pH 8 (mL)
