Meeting minutes
Hugo - Maybe some issues with the measurements over the weekend – Thursday on Friday measurement went really well, those results can be uploaded. This was done with different concentrations of hexane
Nadine – Salt tolerance, measured over the weekend (with LB and M9, concentrations of 0.6-0.9M NaCl)
Hugo is going to do the characterization of alkane degradation; Friday, Ramon will help Hugo in the lab with GC measurements
Do a digestion check of 017?
Eva: 1C3 issues – grow and isolate again
Luke: Pathway maps have been made coupled to MFA for on the wiki, but he should also explain the graphs in words (not only graphs)
It should be good to have a page that summarizes all the results, on which you can click to more information/details
Jelmer: Software tool – almost done, results will be linked to prefoldin
Nadine: Survey on the 25th, no plan yet for where, but questions already thought up, but Dirk Stemerding will
Alkane degradation
For some reason, 009 and 010 just don't want to get into one plasmid. As a last resort we'll try every possible way to get the two together.
