Night of the Nerds @ NEMO Amsterdam - Educating Nerds
Introduction
The ninth of October, the biggest Nerd-event in the Netherlands took place in Science Museum NEMO : the Night of the Nerds . Molecular cooking, 3D-printing, flower-cocktails and eating chocolate-dipped insects, everything a real nerd could ever dream of!
Ofcourse, an iGEM team full of nerds could not miss a party like this.
Educating the Nerds
Well equipped with two video cameras, business cards, team clothing and a good mood we went to NEMO. Not just to have fun with our team, but also to educate the nerd-visitors about synthetic biology.
Next to the interviews we did with the Nerds, we also taught them a bit synthetic biology by talking to them and spreading out info-cards we made.
Information Cards
Information Card - What is Synthetic Biology? Content: Explanation of synthetic biologie & iGEM, What is DNA? What is a gene? What is a protein?
