Lab work
Hydrocarbon Sensing
Cell bank
A cell bank was made from E.coli Top10 cells transformed with AlkS-E0422 and AlkS-B0015. We used 2 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks .
Alkane Degradation
PCR Amplification
K398007A, K398008A, K398009A, K398010A, K398017A, K398018A, K398019A, B0015 were amplified with the universal primers G00100 and G00101. The product was put on 1% agarose gel :
1% agarose of PCR. Gel runned at 100V for 1 hour. Of all samples 10 μL + 2 μL loadingbuffer was loaded. 5 μL was loaded of marker

Plasmid isolation
A plasmid isolation was done on the positive colonies of yesterday . This was done using a Qiagen Miniprep kit . We used 2 mL of the bacterial cells to make -80 °C stocks .
