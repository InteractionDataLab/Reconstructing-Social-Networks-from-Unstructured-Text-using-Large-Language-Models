Labwork
The plasmids of the 1C3 migration were isolated using QIA-gen minipreps.
Salt tolerance
The final salt tolerance assay was run on concentrations of 0 to 0.9 M NaCl. This was measured over the weekend.
Viva México!
Hugo invited us to come watch a number of performances at the Viva México night at the culture centre. With dance, music and wrestling, he together with quite a few fellow Mexicans studying in Delft gave us a glimpse into the Mexican culture and traditions on this fun and entertaining evening!
