Nina
Continuation of protein purification
I got help with the plugged drop column and got the fractions I needed of the lysis, wash and elution buffers.
These samples of 0.5 ml were stored in a freezer for running on an SDS gel.

Gel verification
Gel verification of pSB1C3.SOD digested with EcoRI and SpeI.
3 μl λ; 3 μl sample.
λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder
1 % agarose, 140 V
Expected bands
Vector: 2175 bp
Insert: 495 bp
Results
Band slightly larger than expected, but this may also be due to bound restriction enzymes and/or other disturbances. Proceeded to gel extraction.
Gel extraction
Digested pSB1C3.SOD separated on 1 % agarose gel at 110 V, 17 μl sample volume. SOD band extracted and DNA, as well as DNA from samples stored in -20 °C 7/10, were purified using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction kit.
DNA measurements extremely low, but proceeded to ligation/cloning anyway.

Ligation
his-bFGF and bFGF-his into gel purified pEX, both insert and vector cut with XbaI and PstI
7 µl insert, 0,5 µl pEX
1 µl ligase T4
2 µl 10x buffer
9,5 µl H2O
1 h 37 °C
Transformation
3 µl of both pEX + his-bFGF and pEX + bFGF-his into top10 cells
Overnight culture
Made overnight culture from 10 colonies of tat-bFGF-his which didnt seem to be cut last time
