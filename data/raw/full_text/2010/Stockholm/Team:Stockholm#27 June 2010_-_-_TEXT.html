After a short talk on thursday with some phd, and post-doc, and what maya told me yesterday. Mr. brainstorm told about an article for PPI (protein-protein interaction) networks, http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000807 I think this could be useful for us.
more coming....
