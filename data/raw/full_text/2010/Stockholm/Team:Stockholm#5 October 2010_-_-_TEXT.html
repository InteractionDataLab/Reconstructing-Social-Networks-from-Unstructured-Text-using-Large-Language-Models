Transfer of nCPP⋅SOD⋅His.RBS.yCCS operon to pEX
Plasmid preps
From 4/10 ON cultures
As I'm still waiting for sequencing results of the operons in pSB1K3, I spun down cells (4,400 x g, 10 min), and saved pellets in -20 °C ON.

Ligation of proteins into peX and CPP containing vectors
Ligations:
Fusion protein-His into three vectors each containing all N-terminal CPPs LMWP, TAT and Tra10.
* Gene: 10 ul  * Vector: LMWP 0.5 ul (25ng), TAT 1 ul (20 ng) and Tra10 1 ul (20 ng) * Quick Ligation buffer 2X: LMWP 11.5 ul, TAT 12 ul and Tra10 12 ul * Quick Ligase: 1 ul
His-Fusion protein into three vectors each containing all C-terminal CPPs LMWP, TAT and Tra10.
* Gene: 6 ul  * Vector: CPP1 0.5 ul (25ng), TAT 1 ul (20 ng) and CPP3 1 ul (20 ng) * Quick Ligation buffer 2X: CPP1 7.5 ul, TAT 8 ul and CPP3 8 ul * Quick Ligase: 1 ul
Protein A-His into three vectors each containing all N-terminal CPPs LMWP, TAT and Tra10.
* Gene: 12.5 ul  * Vector: LMWP 0.5 ul (25ng), TAT 1 ul (20 ng) and Tra10 1 ul (20 ng) * Quick Ligation buffer 2X: LMWP 14 ul, TAT 14.5 ul and Tra10 14.5 ul * Quick Ligase: 1 ul
IgG protease_Tra10_Ntermin_#6 into peX vector
* Gene: 7 ul  * Vector: peX 1 (25ng) * Quick Ligation buffer 2X: 9 ul * Quick Ligase: 1 ul
All ligation mixtures were incubated in 22 °C (in a water bath) for 15 minutes. During these minutes I also thawed competent Top 10 cells (100 ul) on ice for transformation of the ligation samples.
Transformation of ligation products
The procedure was according to the method decribed in protocols. However I thawed Top 10 cells (100 ul) in 15 minutes instead of 10. I added 3 ul of ligation samples into each 100 of Top 10 cells.

What went wrong
I got NO colonies on all plates, something is wrong.
Cut
vector with insert, to see if its ligated
vector with insert + BamHI
vector with insret - BamHI
2 µl pEX vector
While running, I talked to Rickard, the guy that yesterday told me that it works to use invitrogen ligase enzyme with fermentas buffer. Further research showed that invitrogen buffer has Pog8000 which fermentas buffer dont have, which probably means that invitrogen ligase needs Pog8000 - which it didnt have in the fermentas buffer
Ligation & transformation
Did another ligation into pEX with fermentas ligase AND buffer, I then transformed 3 µl of all ligations into top10 cells.
Coomassie
Did a coomassie of some constructs from Andreas & Mimmi. SOD, tat-SOD-his, SOD-his, his-SOD and yCCS. 0, 1, 2 and 3h after IPTG induction for all samples.
