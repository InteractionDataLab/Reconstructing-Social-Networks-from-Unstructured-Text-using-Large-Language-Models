Most of vague and unclear questions were made clear by discussing with our expert biologists, nina and johan.
1. we split the project into several phases, production phase, secretion phase and penetration phase. Now it is more or less clear that where should the modeling part begin.
2. we need some gifs and animations for proteins and actually what happens in different pathways.

2 µl loading dye in PCR tube (wrong!), then 5 µl of top (only PCR product) in new tube. Added 2 µl loading dye, then 7 µl on gel
