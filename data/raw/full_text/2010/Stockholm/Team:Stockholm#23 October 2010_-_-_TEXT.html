Unfortunately no pattern seen for the different samples. It seems like something else but the protein extracts is affecting proteolysis of the secondary antibodies. Maybe the primary antibodies conjugated to the agarose is not evenly distributed. Either way, it seems like the digestion is the result of proteolysis by E. coli proteases, not overexpressed IdeS.
