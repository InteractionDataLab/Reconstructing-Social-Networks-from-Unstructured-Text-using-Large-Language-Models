Agarose gel on Colony PCR
I ran agarose gels on all the colony PCR screens from yesterday to check if I had inserts.
Unfortunately non of these gels show that there has been an proper insert of Fusion and Protein A all with the three CPPs in the N-terminal in the pEX vector.
I made a bad decision to conduct the ligation of these parts with the pEX vector and transform the ligations directly into overexpression cells such as BL21. I should have transformed the ligations into cloning cells such as Top 10 and from there as usual perform a mini prep and transform the vectors with insert into BL21 cells. However I hoped some of the ligations that would have ended up as vectors with insert would succesfully get transformed into BL21, but it seems from the gels that this has not happened. We are short of time in the competition and this was a test to see if I could skip the two days I had to spend with transformation into Top 10, but it unfortunatelly did not work out this time.

Colony PCRs
pEX.ProtA⋅His: PA 1 & 2
pEX.IgGp: Ig 1 & 2
Standard colony PCR settings
Elongation time: 1:20
Gel verification
Colony PCR of pEX.ProtA*His and pEX.IgGp constructs.
3 μl λ;5 μl sample.
λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder.
Expected bands
PA: 417 bp
Ig: 1149 bp
Results
All four constructs confirmed.
PCR for Uppsala team
Gel verification
PCR run for the Uppsala team.
3 μl λ; 5 μl sample
λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder.
Expected bands
All constructs: ≈ 6570 bp
Results
Incorrect size. Send to the Uppsala team for analysis.

Miniprep
3 ml of sampled "5-6", "5-8", "AS10" and "EA3". Verification of the last constructs, his-bFGF, bFGF-his and tat-bFGF-his.
Cut miniprep
5 µl DNA
(1 µl BamHI enzyme)
2 µl 10x buffer
12 µl H2O
PCR screen
Of the other constructs in BL21 cells, tra10-bFGF-his, lmwp-bfgf-his, his-bFGF-tra10, his-bFGF-tat, his-bFGF-lmwp. 2 colonies for each plate.
0,5 µl Taq pol
0,5 µl dNTP
5 µl 5x buffer
1 µl pex for primer
1 µl pex rev primer
17 µl H2O
A mastermix 10x was made
Gel of minipreps and PCR screen
Top lanes: Cut & uncut miniprep
Bottom lanes: PCR screens
Results:
Top lanes, I realized I put BamHI even in the samples that was supposed to be uncut!
Bottom lanes: Correct size in the first lane but otherwise empty, why?
