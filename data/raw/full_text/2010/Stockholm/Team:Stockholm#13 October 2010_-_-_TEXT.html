concentration measurement
I measured the concentration of the gel cleaned up samples from yesterday by spectrophotometry.
Ligation
I ligated the gel cleaned samples.
Transformation
I transformed the ligation samples into nine BL21 tubes each with 100 ul cells. I added 6 ul of the ligations to the cells and I thawed the tubes in the first step in 15 min.
I hope this will save some time since I am skipping the transformation into Top 10 cells. We don't have much time left of the competition therefore I hope this will work.
