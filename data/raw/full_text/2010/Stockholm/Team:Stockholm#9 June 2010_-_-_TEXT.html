Testing DH5α competent cells by transformation
This was performed according to tranformation protocol From NEB 5-alpha competent E.coli (High Efficiency) NEW ENGLAND BioLabs.
I transformed both my own cells from yesterday and also the kit's competent cells. Each one had a two serial 10-fold dilution.
Preparation LB agar plates with ampicillin resistance
LB agar:
25 g LB
15 g bactoagar
Fill up to 1 L with distilled water
Autoclave for 120°C, 20 min
Cool down
Add 200 mg ampiciliin in 1,8 ml water
Pour out on plates
Johan
Transformation
A transformation was performed to test the competence of the cells, both with our own and competent cells from a kit.
LB agar plates with ampicillin
25 g LB
15 g bactoAgar
up to 1L ddH2O
Autoclave 120 °C 20 min
Cool down
Add 200 mg Amp in 1,8 ml H2O
For 1L of LB add 1 ml of 100 mg/ml
Pour on plates
PCR
PCR of SOD and yCCS to add prefix/suffix
Mix
30 µl H2O
10 µl 5x buffer
1 µl 50 mM MgCl2
1 µl 10 mM dNTPS
1 µl DNA templ.
3 µl 5 µM F.primer
3 µl 5 µM R.primer
1 µl PfuX Polymerase
Program
1: 98 °C 2 min
2: 98 °C 10 sec
3: 55 °C 15 sec
