Nina
Send for sequencing
I sent samples for sequencing and the mixtures were 15 ul sample and 1.5 ul forward bank vector verification primer.
Protein A in LMWP_Ntermin ASB0045 680
Protein A in TAT_Ntermin ASB0045 679
Protein A in Tra10_Ntermin ASB0045 678
Digestion of protein A and peX vector
I got a mini prep of the peX vector from Andreas with a concentration of 55.52 ng/ul. I cut this vector and protein A in CPPs_N vectors.
peX:
Fast digest buffer 10X 3.4 ul
DNA 30 ul
Restriction enzyme XbaI 2 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 2 ul
Incubated in 37 °C for 30 min.
Protein A:
Fast digest buffer 10X 2.2 ul
DNA 20 ul
Restriction enzyme XbaI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul
Incubated in 37 °C for 30 min.
Agarose gel on digests
I ran the digested products on an agarose gel 1 % 100 V.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arrangement on gel:
Gel clean up
I performed a gel clean up according to the procedures described in protocols.
On the gel it looked like it was only the peX vector that had been cut correctly and thus the protein A didn't seem to have been previously inserted correctly into the vectors holding the CPPs on the N-terminal. Therefore I only cut out and gel clean the peX vector for later use in overexpressions of our proteins.
The measurements of the cut gel bands, addition of kit solutions and incubation time:
All bands had a weight of approximately 300 mg. 300 mg * 3 = 900 ul QXI
I added 30 ul of QIAEXII to all samples
All samples were incubated for 5 minutes at 50 °C
Miniprep
I performed a mini prep on Fusion EA # 1 and 3. Fusion AS I have to put a new overnight culture of since I accidentally dropped the solution and the material is now lost.
The procedure was according to the method described in protocols.
Overnight culture
I inoculated IgG protease_Tra10 # 4 & 6 in each 12 ml LB falcon tubes with 24 ul chloramphenicol.
Digestion of vectors with CPP
I digested bank vectors holding LMWP_N, TAT_N, Tra10_N, CPP1_C, TAT_C and CPP3_C to become followed by a gel clean up.
Digestion:
DNA 20 ul
Fast digest buffer 10X 2.2 ul
CPPs-Ntermin:
Restriction enzyme AgeI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
CPPs-Ctermin:
Restriction enzyme NgoMIV 1 ul
Restriction enzyme EcoRI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
Agarose gel on digests
I ran the digests on an agarose 1 % gel 80 V.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arragement on gel:
Gel clean up
I performed a gel clean up according to the procedure described in protocols.
The measurements of the cut gel bands, addition of kit solutions and incubation time:
All bands had a weight of approximately 150 mg. 150 mg * 3 = 450 ul QXI
I added 30 ul of QIAEXII to all samples
All samples were incubated for 5 minutes at RT
Concentration measurments
I measured with a spectrophotometer the concentration of the gel clean up samples.
Mimmi
Expression
yCCS expression looks very fine!
no SOD
much to low concentration loaded?
try E-colves for more air
taking samples after both 0.5h and 3h if the protein becomes degraded after time
SOD operon
Plasmid prep. and sequencing
Follow E.T.Z.N.A plasmid prep. protocol
wash 1x wash buffer
eluate in 50µl
