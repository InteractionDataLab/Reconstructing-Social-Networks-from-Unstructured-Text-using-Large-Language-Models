Nina
Gel clean up
I loaded samples in an agarose gel 1 % and ran at 80 V.
Samples:
Protein A_TAT_N, _Tra10_N and _LMWP_N
Fusion_CPP1, TAT_C ans _CPP3
Fusion_TAT_N, _Tra10_N and _LMWP_N
The procedure was according to the description in protocols.
Weight of all samples: 200 mg
200 * 3 = 600 ul QXI
In step 3 I added 10 ul of QIAEXII to each sample.
Polyacrylamide gel
I ran a gel of the purified SOD.His (N terminal) to check if there had been any purification of the protein.
Ladder: PageRuler Unst. Protein Ladder
Arrangement on the gel:
Gel:
The gel was incubated in coomassie blue staining and destained on shake.
Unfortunately there were no bands representing SOD.His (~17 kDa) on the gel, which must mean that there was too small culture (12 ml) and that the cells have not been lysed properly. I will redo this work but with more start culture and lyse the cells in a more effiecient way.
The polyacrylamide gel was prepared by the SDS-PAGE mixtures described in protocols.

Removal of insertion in BioBrick suffixes
Transformation results
Good colony yield on all plates. A few red colonies discovered on all plates, indicating that some partly digested pSB1C3 vector, still containing the RFP insert, had been excised during gel extraction.
Colony PCR
From 11/10 transformations'
pSB1C3.IgGp A-C
pSB1C3.bFGF A-C
pSB1C3.ProtA A-C
pSB1C3.yCCS A-C
pSB1C3.SOD A-C
Standard colony PCR settings
1:15 elongation time
Gel verification
Gel 1. Colony PCR gel verification of cloned with insertion removed.
3 μl λ; 5 μl sample.
λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder.
Gel 2. Colony PCR gel verification of cloned with insertion removed.
3 μl λ; 5 μl sample.
λ = O'GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder.
Gel 1: 1 % agarose, 140 V
Gel 2: 1 % agarose, 160 V
Expected bands
pSB1C3.IgGp: 1262 bp
pSB1C3.bFGF: 794 bp
pSB1C3.ProtA: 506 bp
pSB1C3.yCCS: 1076 bp
pSB1C3.SOD: 791 bp
