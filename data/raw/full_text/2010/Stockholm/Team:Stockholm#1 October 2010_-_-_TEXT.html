Nina
Miniprep
I performed a miniprep on IgG protease_Tra10_Ntermin#4 and Fusion_NS#2 according to the procedure that is described in protocols.
Send for sequencing
I sent two samples for seqeuncing. The mixture was 15 ul sample and 1.5 ul forward bank vector verification primer VF.
IgG protease_Tra10_Ntermin#4 ASB0045 682
Fusion_NS#2 ASB0045 681
Overnight culture
I inoculated 12 ml LB and 24 ul chloramphenicol with IgG protease_Tra10_Ntermin#6 again since I acidentally droped the previous sample and therefore lost it.
iGEM Uppsala collaboration
I drove to Uppsala and started a collaboration with their team. I obtained a construct that they want me/our group to PCR with verification primers (VF2 & VR) and run on an agarose gel. I in turn gave them the tyrosinase gene to also amplify via PCR but with own designed primers.

Mimmi
Over expression
Start culture   (9:30)
20ml LB + 200µl culture from ON
At OD=0.6 add IPTG 1mM (checked at 12:00, allready too high OD, had to dilute...)
Take samples at
0h
30min (50min)
3h
Spinn down and resuspend in 100µl SDS-buffer
dilute 3h samples 1:4
heat at 95°C for 10min
freeze
Save pellet from the culture to purify protein
Johan
Realized I had put in the wrong antibiotic in my overnight cultures (doh!). Made new overnight cultures for tomorrow.
