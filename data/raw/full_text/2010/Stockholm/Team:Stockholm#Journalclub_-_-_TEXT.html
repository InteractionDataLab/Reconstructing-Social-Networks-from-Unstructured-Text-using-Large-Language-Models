Synthetic biology
Synthetic biology--putting engineering into biology. M Heinemann, S Panke. Bioinformatics (2006) vol. 22 (22) pp. 2790
Synthetic biology is interpreted as the engineering-driven building of increasingly complex biological entities for novel applications. Encouraged by progress in the design of artificial gene networks, de novo DNA synthesis and protein engineering, we review the case for this ...
The promise of synthetic biology. J Pleiss. Applied microbiology and biotechnology (2006) vol. 73 (4) pp. 735-739
Abstract DNA synthesis has become one of the techno- logical bases of a new concept in biology: synthetic biology. The vision of synthetic biology is a systematic, hierarchical design of artificial, biology-inspired systems using robust, standardized, and well-characterized ...
A synthetic biology challenge: making cells compute. C Tan, H Song, J Niemi, L You. Molecular BioSystems (2007) vol. 3 (5) pp. 343-353
Advances in biology and engineering have enabled the reprogramming of cells with well-defined functions, leading to the emergence of synthetic biology. Early successes in this nascent field suggest its potential to impact diverse areas. Here, we examine the feasibility of ...
Synthetic biology. A Tavassoli. Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry (2010) vol. 8 (1) pp. 24-28
There is currently much excitement surrounding the rapidly growing discipline of synthetic biology, which utilizes the design and construction principles of engineering to develop, evolve and standardize biological components and systems. This systematic approach to ...
Engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts. RP Shetty, D Endy, TF Knight Jr. Journal of Biological Engineering (2008) vol. 2 pp. 5
The underlying goal of synthetic biology is to make the process of engineering biological systems easier. Recent work has focused on defining and developing standard biological parts. The technical standard that has gained the most traction in the synthetic biology community is the ...
Towards synthesis of a minimal cell. AC Forster, GM Church. Molecular Systems Biology (2006) vol. 2 (1)
Construction of a chemical system capable of replication and evolution, fed only by small molecule nutrients, is now conceivable. This could be achieved by stepwise integration of decades of work on the reconstitution of DNA, RNA and protein syntheses from pure components. Such a ...
Foundations for engineering biology. D Endy. Nature (2005) vol. 438 (7067) pp. 449-453
Please complete one of the following projects in the next hour: write down the DNA sequence that programmes a biofilm to take a photograph and perform distributed edge-detection on the light-encoded image; or, the DNA sequence that encodes a ring oscillator that works ...
The second wave of synthetic biology: from modules to systems. PEM Purnick, R Weiss. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology (2009) vol. 10 (6) pp. 410-422
Synthetic biology is a research field that combines the investigative nature of biology with the constructive nature of engineering. Efforts in synthetic biology have largely focused on the creation and perfection of genetic devices and small modules that are constructed from these ...
At a glance: Cellular biology for engineers. K Khoshmanesh, AZ Kouzani, S Nahavandi, S Baratchi, JR Kanwar. Computational Biology and Chemistry (2008) vol. 32 (5) pp. 315-331
Engineering contributions have played an important role in the rise and evolution of cellular biology. Engineering technologies have helped biologists to explore the living organisms at cellular and molecular levels, and have created new opportunities to tackle the unsolved ...
Synthetic biology: understanding biological design from synthetic circuits. Shankar Mukherji, Alexander van Oudenaarden. Nature Reviews Genetics (2009) vol. 10 (12) pp. 859-871
An important aim of synthetic biology is to uncover the design principles of natural biological systems through the rational design of gene and protein circuits. Here, we highlight how the process  of engineering biological systems — from synthetic promoters to the control of ...
