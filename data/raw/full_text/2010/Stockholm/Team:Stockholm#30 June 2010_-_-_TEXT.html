Morning meeting
We discussed the project proceedings.
It was decided that already amplified genes (cloned in pEX vector) should be transferred to pSB1C3 vector.
IgG protease
Superoxidase dismutase (SOD)
yCCS
bFGF
Primers for not-yet amplified genes should be redesigned to include the complete Assembly standard 25 prefix and suffix.
CPP
Transportan 10
LMWP
TAT
MITF
Protein A Z-domain
Tyrosinase
Vitamin B9 genes
BL21(DE3) was chosen as our strain for IPTG-induced protein expression from pEX vector.
Andreas
Expression of SOD and yCCS from pEX expression vector
Continued from 29/6
We realized that Top10 and DH5alpha are not suitable for IPTG-induced protein expression. SOD and yCCS expression was therefore not proceeded from ON cultures. Glycerol stocks were prepared from ON culture and pEX.SOD and pEX.yCCS plasmids were prepared.

Preparation of competent BL21(DE3) cells
5 ml LB was inoculated with BL21(DE3) cells and grown ON in 37°C, 250 rpm.
Mimmi
CPP's
designing primers for assembly standard 25
No start or stop codon
From the pSB1AsF:
Only the length can be ajusted, too short with 16 bases?
Transportan10
Probably good to bind in the C-terminal end (not tested):
To sit in the N-terminal end of the protein of interest:
Sequence the right way, use the n-part prefix
G     . . AATTC--------------114---------------CTGCA . .     G
CTTAA . .     G--------------106---------------G     . . ACGTC
To sit in the C-terminal end of the protein of interest:
turn the aa sequence around -> the DNA sequence around, use the normal prefix
LMWP
Binding in the N-terminal (as done in the study):
To sit in the N-terminal end of the protein of interest:
turn the aa sequence around -> the DNA sequence around, use the n-part prefix
To sit in the C-terminal end of the protein of interest:
Sequence the right way, use the normal prefix
TAT (dowdy's)
Binding in both terminals (neither is done in the study):
Johan
Miniprep
Promega plasmid yield
2 tubes bFGF, 3 ml from each (maximum for that protocol)
Abs: 20 ng/µl & 70 ng/µl
Miniprep
- Rest of bFGF (12 ml in total)  - 12 ml * 5 pEX
