iGEM Stockholm 2010
We are a group of undergraduate students studying life science with professors as mentors at Stockholm University. This is our website about our work and effort in representing our school as Team Stockholm in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition against other teams from all over the world.
iGEM is an international research competition focused on synthetic biology. Each team is given a kit containing biological parts for practical work, which takes place at each teams' university. The use of these biological parts in combination with self-designed parts, will lay the ground for building innovative and useful new biological systems and operate them in living cells.
This competition opens for students to think “out of the box” when engineering living organisms to be applied as tools for solving problems in healthcare, bioenergy, chemical and material production and bioremediation, to name a few.
The principles in the field of synthetic biology is to combine science and engineering in order to genetically design and build living cells with novel biological roles and systems, aimed at overcoming the obstacles in modern life.
Stay tuned for daily updates in the run up to the finals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)!
