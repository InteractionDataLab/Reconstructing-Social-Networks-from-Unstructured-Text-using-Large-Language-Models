Nina
Results from "Testing DH5α competent cells by transformation" (9/6-2010)
My own cells are not competent since they gave no colonies on the selection plates. However, the kit's cells resulted in many colonies, thus are competent as expected. This means that I have to redo a new set of my own competent cells.
Johan
Result from transformation
Our own cells showed no sign of competence as they gave no colonies. However the cells from the kit showed many colonies. We therefore made a new overnight culture.
Gel electrophoresis
1 % gel:
3 g agarose powder
300 ml 1x TAE buffer
15 µl EtBr
Ladder: Fermentas 1KB DNA ladder
SOD showed the expected result of just below 500 bp and yCSS showed the expected result of 750 bp.
