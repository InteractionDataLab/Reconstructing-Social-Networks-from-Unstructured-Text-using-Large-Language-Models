Cloning of N-CPPs into pSB1C3 & Extraction of RBS BioBrick (BBa_B0030)
Transformations from 9/9 resulted in good colony yields on all plates. Chose "pSB1C3.N-CPP* 9/9" for colony PCR.
Colony PCR
Picked 12 N-CPP* clones (NC 1-12) and 4 RBS clones (RBS 1-4)

Gel verification
Colony PCR gel verification of pSB1C3.N-CPP (NC) and pSB1A2.BBa_B0030 (RBS) clones.
50 bp λ = GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder; 1 kb λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder
Also ran two samples for Mimmi (E & S)
1.5 % agarose, 90 V
Expected bands
N-Tra10: 389 bp
N-TAT: 359 bp
N-LMWP: 368 bp
RBS B0030: 253 bp
Results
N-CPPs: Potentially correct bands for clones 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12
RBS B0030: Correct-sized bands for all four clones.
ON cultures
Set ON cultures for all relevant N-CPPs, for plasmid prep.

Extraction of RBS BioBrick (BBa_B0034)
After studying the original RBS of our expression vector pEX, we decided that BBa_B0034 was a better candidate for our SOD/yCCS operon than BBa_B0030, as it better resembles the RBS of pEX, as well as minimizes the distance from the first gene in the operon.
Extracted BBa_B0034 (RBS 34), carried on pSB1A2, from iGEM plate 1, well 2M. Transformed into Top10.

Preparation of chemically competent Top10
Since I've previously experienced slight AmpR contamination in our latest batch of competent Top10, I streaked an LB agar plate with competent Top10 cells to isolate single clones.
