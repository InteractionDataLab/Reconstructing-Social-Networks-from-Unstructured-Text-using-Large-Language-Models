Andreas
Preparation of Top10 chemically competent cells
None of the clones streaked onto the Amp 100 plate (11/9) grew, indicating no AmpR contamination in cells. One of the ON cultures were therefore selected for preparation of competent cells.
Procedures according to protocol. Growth conditions changed to 25 °C, 220 rpm (OD600 reached after ≈6 h).
A 100 μl aliquot was divided and spread onto Amp 100, Cm 25 and Km 50 plates to verify that they were not contaminated.
Cloning of N-CPPs into pSB1C3
Sequencing results from 8/9 returned.
pSB1C3.nCPP 3 (failed)
pSB1C3.nCPP 4 ( fasta )
pSB1C3.nCPP 6 ( fasta )
pSB1C3.nCPP 7 ( fasta )
pSB1C3.nCPP 8 ( fasta )
Blastn alignments against N-Tra10 , N-TAT and N-LMWP indicated successful cloning of N-Tra10 (clone 7) and N-TAT (clone 4).
Transformations
Since pSB1C3.N-TAT and pSB1C3.N-Tra10 colony samples were accidentally discarded, prepared plasmids were used to transform new cells in order to prepare glycerol stocks.
Standard transformation with 1 μl plasmid DNA.
pSB1C3.N-TAT
pSB1C3.N-Tra10
Sequencing
DNA concentrations of 11/9 plasmid preps were measured by Mimmi and samples were sent for sequencing for isolation of N-LMWP.

Should have saved more original MITF (stupid!)
Make new MITF-M
RBS
plasmid prep.
Follow original protocol
Wash 2 times with DNA wash buffer
Eluate in 50µl
Eluate 2 times with the same sH2O
DNA conc. RBS34a ~42ng/µl -> ~60ng/µl RBS34b ~41ng/µl -> ~60ng/µl
