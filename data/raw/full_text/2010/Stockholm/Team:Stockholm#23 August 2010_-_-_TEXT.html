Nina
Sequencing of fusion protein
I prepared one tube of the fusion protein made up by protein A and IgG protease:
15 ul plasmid from a mini-prep and 1.5 ul (10uM) primer VF2 of the bank vectors (C) verification primers.
ASB0045 B00
Ligation of protein A in peX
I performed a ligation of protein A with the peX vector in order to induce the protein with IPTG o be able to see that the protein can become overexpressed in BL21 cells.
Ligation:
I wanted 25 ng vector
90 ng/ul / X = 25 ng/ul
X = 3 which means a 1:3 dilution. 1 ul vector sample and 2 ul dH2O. This results in 30 ng vector which is OK.
I wanted ~4 times more gene than vector. Usually it is enough with 3 times more gene than vector but since this gene is pretty small (180 bp) I prefer to have a 4X more gene.
4 * 30 = 120
120 ng/ul / 30ng/ul = 4 times more gene than vector.
Vector peX: 1 ul
Gene protein A: 5 ul
Quick ligase: 1 ul
2X quick ligase buffer: 7 ul
Tot Volume: 14 ul
I incubated in RT for 15 min.
PCR of ligation product
I wanted to check if I had a correct ligation before I transformed it into BL21 cells. Therefore I performed a PCR on the ligation product with peX verification primers.
PCR mix:
MgCl 1 ul
Buffer 5X 10 ul
dNTP 1 ul
primer peX forward 3 ul
primer peX reverse 3 ul
polymerase PjuX7 1 ul
H2O 30 ul
Template 1 ul
PCR prgm:
Agarose gel on protein A
I ran an agarose gel 1 % 100 V on the PCR product of protein A in the peX vector in order to verify that the ligation has occured properly.
Ladder: FastRuler™ Low Range DNA Ladder, ready-to-use, 50-1500 bp Fermentas
The gel results show that I have had a good ligation since I got a band just below 400 on the ladder which I expected. The protein A gene is 180 nt and the verification primers add 200 nt which give a 380 nt band. This allows for a transformation tomorrow of the ligation product into BL21 cells.

Transfer of RFP coding device to pEX
Colony restreaks
Results from 21/8
All clones grew well on the Amp plate, but not on Km, indicating RFP has indeed been transfered from pSB1K3 to a target AmpR vector, and that pSB1K3 does not express AmpR.
I later realized that the transfer of RFP was not from pSB1K3, but from pSB1C3, making this restreak pointless.
Gel verification of Dig pEX X+P and Dig pC.RFP X+P
Gel verification of digested pEX and pSB1C3.RFP samples from 19/8.
Loading vol.: 4 μl λ; 4 μl sample.
λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder.
Ran a gel of the digestion samples from 19/8 to verify the sizes of vectors and inserts.
1 % agarose, 100 V, 1 h 20 min
Expected bands
Dig pEX X+P
4453 bp (vector)
1237 bp (insert)
Dig pC.RFP X+P
2054 bp (pSB1C3 vector)
1095 bp (RFP insert)
Results
The bands for "pC.RFP X+P" correspond well to what was expected. However, none of the "pEX X+P" bands do. It might be possible that this is actually a pMA vector, carrying a ≈800 bp insert (unclear what). This would explain why ligations and transformations from 19/8 resulted in red colonies, but colony PCR amplification with pEX primers doesn't result in any bands.
