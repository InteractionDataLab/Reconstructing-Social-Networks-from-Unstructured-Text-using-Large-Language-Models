Plasmid prep and glycerol stock
The cells were cultured to 0.6 OD, 1.6 ml were used to the glycerol stock and 10 ml were used to extract the plasmid

Add a pipette tip of BL21 pEX.BBa_J18932 from glycerol stock and grow ON
Nina
Sequencing CPP transportan 10 version C
I send two samples of CPP transportan 10 version C with colony number 9 and 40 for sequencing.
15 ul vector
1.5 ul 10uM VR2 primer
9: ASB003N X99
40: ASB003N X98
Inoculation of IgG protease
I placed the inoculation samples in the refrigerator for mini prep the following day when I know which sample is suitable for miniprep.
