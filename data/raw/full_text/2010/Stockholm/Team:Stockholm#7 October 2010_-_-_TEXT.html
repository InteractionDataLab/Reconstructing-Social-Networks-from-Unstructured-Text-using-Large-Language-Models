Removal of insertion in BioBrick suffixes
An insertion between SpeI and PstI present in IgGp, bFGF, ProtA, yCCS and SOD needs to be removed before submission to the Registry. This will be done by digestion with SpeI (inside insertion) and moving digested gene into a new vector.
Digestions
No sample of SOD available for the moment, so this will be digested after plasmid prep.

Gel extraction
Loaded remaining 17 μl of each sample on a new 1 % agarose gel. Relevant bands excised by gel extraction and saved in -20 ° for later purification.
ON culture
Set ON culture of pSB1C3.SOD for later plasmid prep.

Mini prep
I performed a mini prep according to the procedure described in protocols.
The experiment was carried out on colony # 1 from protein A _LMWP_N, _TAT_N, _Tra10_N, Fusion _CPP1, _TAT_C, _CPP3, Fusion_LMWP_N, _TAT_N & _Tra10_N
Protein induction
I prepared a culture of SOD.His (both N & C terminal), SOD_TAT_N, SOD_LMWP_N & SOD_Tra_10 to reach OD600 = 0.6. Then I induced these with IPTG 10 ul/sample.
I took samples at 0, 1, 2 & 3 h, centrifuged 1 min 13000 rpm, resuspended the pellet with 50 ul water and added 50 ul RDSB (with DTT) and stored in a freezer until suitable for loading into an SDS-gel.
Making solution
I made some solutions of RDSB to have in the freezer when loading protein induction on gel.
Werners sample buffer:
SDS 4.5 g
Glycerol 15 % 7.5 ml
Tris pH 7.8 (30 mM) 1.5 ml (1M)
Bromophenol Blue (a tip of a spoon)
H2O up to 50 ml
900 ul Werners sample buffer + 100 ul DTT (1M)
Verification of ligation
I ran an agarose gel 1 % 100 V to check if the ligation of IgG_Tra10_N in the pEX vector was successful, but when I looked at the gel there were no bands at all. I must have missed to add the vector and the gene in the ligation.

Results: The second tra10-bFGF-his dont work, I took two colonies from that construct for a reason :). tat-bFGF-his dont work, I have to re-do that construct.
Cut his-bFGF & bFGF-his
To put into pEX.
5 µl his-bFGF & bFGF-his
2 µl 10x fastbuffer
1 µl XbaI

Gel of Ninas samples
I had time over so I did a gel of
tra10-igg-his ligated into pEX, to see if the gene is ligated
10 samples of another constructs
Results: Noting.. Nina must have done something wrong..
