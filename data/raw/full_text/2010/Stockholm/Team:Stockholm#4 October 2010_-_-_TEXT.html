Verification of pSB1x3 plasmids
Due to some strange growth results with our stock plasmids (pSB1x3.BBa_J04450), I decided to verify their antibiotic resistance. Restreaked clones of the following plasmids (w/ BBa_J04450 inserts) onto Amp 100, Km 50 and Cm 25 plates:
pSB1A3
pSB1C3
pSB1K3
pSB1AC3
pSB1AK3
Assembly of His⋅SOD⋅cCPP constructs

Received cCPPs (cTra10, cTAT and cLMWP) in pSB1C3 plasmids, digested with EcoRI and NgoMIV, from Johan.

Mini prep on IgG_Tra10_N#6
I performed a mini prep on yesterday's inoculated IgG_Tra10_N colony # 6 in 12 ml LB with 24 ul chloramphenicol. The procedure was according to the method described in protocols.
Overday culture of SOD
I put an overday culture of SOD-peX, His-SOD, SOD-His, SOD_TAT_Ntermin and as a positive control yCC-peX from Andrea's glycerol stocks in 12 ml LB with 24 ul amphicillin. I inoculated with a big pipett tip amount in order to have the culture reaching OD 0.6 during the day of laboration.
The reason for why I did this culture was because I had talked to Mimmi about her overexpressions about these constructs and she hadn't got any satisfying results on her gels beside from the yCC sample (which became my positive control). I wanted therefore to check if I would also obtain her type of outcome when overexpressing the proteins of interest.
Gene digestions
I performed digestions of my genes of interest in order to do a gel clean up and follow with a ligation that should yield many positive cloning results.
Digestions:
Fusion_EA_His # 1 & 3 10 ul
Fast digestion buffer 10 X 2 ul
H2O 6 ul
Restriction enzyme NgoMVI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
Fusion_NS_His # 2 10 ul
Fast digestion buffer 10 X 2 ul
H2O 6 ul
Restriction enzyme AgeI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme EcoRI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
Protein A_EA_His # 5 10 ul
Fast digestion buffer 10 X 2 ul
H2O 6 ul
Restriction enzyme NgoMVI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
IgG protease_EA_His # 5 10 ul
Fast digestion buffer 10 X 2 ul
H2O 6 ul
Restriction enzyme NgoMVI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul (Added after 1.5 h in 37 °C)
IgG protease_Tra10_Ntermin # 4 & 6 10 ul
Fast digestion buffer 10 X 2 ul
H2O 6 ul
Restriction enzyme XbaI 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul
Incubate in 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Agarose gel on digests
I ran an agarose gel 1 % 100 V on the digested samples in order to check if they have been digested by the enzymes and followed by cutting the bands of interest out of the gel with a scalpel over a UV-lamp for a gel clean up.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arrangement on gels:
Gel clean up
I performed a gel clean up of the digested genes. All except IgGEA#5 were digested and cut out of the gel.
I performed the clean up according to the method described in protocols.
The measurements of the cut gel bands, addition of kit solutions and incubation time:
All bands had a weight of aproximately 0.12 g (120 mg). 120 mg * 3 = 360 ul QXI
I added 10 ul of QIAEXII to all samples
All samples were incubated for 5 minutes at RT
I performed step 11 in the procedure description
Concentration measurments
I measured with a spectrophotometer the concentration of the gel clean up samples.
Sending for sequencing
I sent IgG_Tra10_Ntermin#6 for sequencing. I mixed 15 ul of the miniprep sample and 1.5 ul of Forward bank vector verification primer (VF).
