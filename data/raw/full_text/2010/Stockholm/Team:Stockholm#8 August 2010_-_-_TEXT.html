Cloning
Colony PCR
Comparison of colony PCR results of pSB1A3.yCCS A & B and pSB1C3.BBa_J18932.
Loading: 1 kb λ, yCCSA A, yCCSA B, yCCSB A, yCCSB B, BBa_J18932 A, BBa_J18932 B
3 μl &lambda, 6 μl sample.
Colony PCR gel verification of IgG protease.
Loading: A, B, 1 kb &lambda, C, D, blank.
3 μl λ, 6 μl sample.
Picked four colonies from 3/8 IgG protease plate (A, B, C & D). Also chose two plasmid samples of pSB1C3.BBa_J18932 (A & B) for PCR verification, to be compared with the amplified yCCS samples from 7/8.

Results
Bands seem identical in size. Highly probable that my yCCS clones are incorrect.
Strange band sizes, not corresponding at all to what would be expected from IgG protease. I will redo IgG protease cloning next week.
Did I forget to load the ladder, or did I load loading dye? That might explain the big blob.
