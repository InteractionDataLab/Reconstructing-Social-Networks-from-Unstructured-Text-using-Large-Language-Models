From 27/8
Purified DNA from excised samples "Extr. Dig. SOD E+A" and "Extr. N-CPP cluster" using the E.Z.N.A. Gel extraction kit; procedures according to provided protocol.
Elution volume: 30 μl (eluted twice to increase DNA yield)

DNA purification of "Dig. pMA.His (E+N)"
From 27/8
DNA clean-up using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction kit, following procedures for DNA purification.
Elution volume: 30 μl (eluted twice to increase DNA yield)
Pur. Dig. pMA His E+N
Gel verification
Gel verification of gel extracted and purified DNA samples.
3 μl λ; 2 μl sample.
1 kb λ=O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder. 50 bp λ=GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder.
Since no DNA content was measurable for "Extr. Dig SOD E+A", a gel was run to verify DNA content in the three purified samples.
1 % agarose, 110 V
Samples:
SOD: Extr. Dig SOD E+A
pMA: Pur. Dig pMA.His E+N
CPP: Extr. N-CPP cluster
Expected bands:
SOD: 492 bp
pMA: 2427 bp
CPP: 379 bp
Results
CPP resulted in a clear band of correct size.
A very weak band at ≈500 bp is visible for SOD, which might be traces of DNA.
No band visible for pMA.
Nevertheless, proceeded to ligation and cloning, hoping that the DNA is there.

Amplification of N-CPPs from N-CPP cluster
Ran PCRs from the gel extracted N-CPP cluster with the following primers:
Tra10: pSB-VF2 & pSB-VR
TAT: pEXf & pEXr
LMWP: pGexf & pGexr
Also ran 4 colony PCRs for Mimmi from cells transformed with pSB1C3.MITF plasmids (MITF 1-4); positive control (PC) pSB1C3.RFP; negative control (NC) blank; primers pSB-VF2 & pSB-VR.

22.5 μl dH2O

0.5 μl template DNA
Standard colony PCR settings; 1:45 elongation time.
Gel verification
Gel verification of PCR amplified pSB1C3.MITF and N-CPPs.
3 μl λ; 4 μl sample.
1 kb λ=O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder. 50 bp λ GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder.
1 % agarose, 100 V
Expected bands:
MITF: 1586 bp
PC: 1385 bp
Tra10: 182 bp
TAT: 91 bp
LMWP: 94 bp
Results
No relevant bands for MITF samples. Ran the gel too far for the CPP bands. Tra10 is still visible and seems correct. There might also be two bands at the very edge of the gel, supporting the 91 bp and 94 bp for TAT and LMWP, respectively.
Decided to go on with gel extraction of CPPs anyway.
Gel extraction
1 % agarose, 110 V. 22 μl sample (Tra10/TAT/LMWP)
Bands on UV table seemed correct relative to each other. Bands excised and gel excisions saved in -20 °C for later.
