How predictive and precise can this model be?
This model lacks lots of details in it, so it can't be a precise model for calculating a steady state for a protein production in bacteria. But the toy model that we presented in the final equations for a gene in our plasmid can be extended and one needs to take into account several factor before extending the model to a more informative one.
Good timing: Since we are using CPP fused to our proteins this could be interesting to consider critical CPP concentrations in bacteria. Because it is hypothesized that CPP can lead to its host's death by penetrating membrane.
Rare codons: Will process stall because of rare codons? The amount of rare codons, and how repetitivet they are is an important factor. (for more information look in [5] and [6])
RNAP: How strong will RNAP bind? and How long is the transcription initiation time? This is very interesting question, since in our model we didn't consider them (because we removed time delays in our final set of equations)
Diffusion time: Do you really need to worry about diffusion? if yes, then this will introduce another type of delay which is usually negligible.
CPP interactions: If your proteins are fused with CPPs, then the only case that you need to take care of is the amount of secretion. So one needs to take care of external concentration and if it is lethal to its host.
