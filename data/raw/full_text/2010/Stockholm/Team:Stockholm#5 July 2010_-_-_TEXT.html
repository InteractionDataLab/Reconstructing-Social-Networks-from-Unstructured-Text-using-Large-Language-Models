Part and primer design
I investigated Mimmi's primers, most specifically the ones designed for ligation of our CPPs (TAT, LMWP and Transportan 10). Me and Johan discussed whether we should order them as is, or if we should instead have the genes synthesized. We decided that we should rethink the matter until tomorrow, when we can have a group meeting and discuss this further.
Johan also discovered that several of our genes contain disallowed BioBrick restriction sites:
Tyrosinase contains one NgoMIV site at 500 bp.
yCCS contains one EcoRI site at 230 bp.
bFGF contains one AgeI site at 350 bp.
These need to be removed. We will discuss this tomorrow.
Johan
PCR bFGF, 16 colonies
gel
All bands too small (250) nt. After discussion with Rob we looked at the sequence and found that the gene has a AgeI restriction site. NOT GOOD
