Mimmi
flourecent pEX
over expression
Take an aliquote of the ON culture and add fresh culture (1:100)
Also, 4 small colonies were taken from Johan's bFGF as a control
Meassure after ~2h and then more often until OD=0.6
When OD=0.6 add IPTG to induce protein production. Take 1ml sample after 0h, 2h and 3h
Centrifuge down the cells (13000rpm, 1m) trash LB, add 50µl H2O and resuspend the cells
Add 50µl ROSB to denature the proteins
Freeze samples
Site-directed mutagenesis
Designing primers
Using Agilent Technologies primer design software
Restriction site Age1 A|CCG GT --> A CCA GT easy changed, commonly used codon
Pst1 C TGC A|G --> C TGA A|G best possible, though pyridin/pyrimidin change
