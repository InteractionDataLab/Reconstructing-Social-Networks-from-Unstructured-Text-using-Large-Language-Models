Results from the different antibody dilutions are somewhat contradictory. The 1.5x108/1:500 samples indicate a higher IgG protolysis activity for the induced IgGp sample, followed by the uninduced IgGp and induced SOD, which would be the expected results from a functional IgG protease (IdeS). However, for the corresponding 1:1000 antibody dilution the results are almost opposite.
Furthermore, the 1.5x105 dilutions seem too low to give any recordable and reliable results.
The experiment will be repeated with the 1.5x108 extracts and 1:500 as well as 1:250 antibody dilutions, so see if the results are reproducible.
Assay restart
Assay restarted as described above, with duplicate samples.
