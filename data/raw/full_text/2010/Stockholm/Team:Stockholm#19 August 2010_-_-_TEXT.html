Site-directed mutagenesis of SOD & yCCS
Sequencing results
Received the sequencing results for m-SOD 1 , m-SOD 2 , m-yCCS 1 and m-yCCS 4 from Eurofins. Ran a nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn) alignment to verify successful site-directed mutagenesis.
SOD 1: Failed ( BLASTn results )
Mutation still present
SOD 2: Success ( BLASTn results )
Mutation removed
yCCS 1: Success ( BLASTn results )
EcoRI site removed
yCCS 4: Success ( BLASTn results )
EcoRI site removed
All sequences revealed an insertion in the Freiburg suffix, between PstI and SpeI sites. We were aware of this, and the insertion will be removed by digestion later.
BLASTn results also revealed three mutations in both yCCS sequences. A protein BLAST (BLASTp) alignment of the translated yCCS sequences revealed all three mutations as silent mutations ( BLASTp results ).
SOD 1 sample and glycerol stock will be discarded; the other clones are saved as verified.
Assembly of CPP⋅protein⋅His constructs
Brief introduction
Our goal is to assemble our CPPs together with our protein-coding genes and a His tag, in one of two ways:
CPPs with N-part prefix (N-CPP): CPP⋅gene⋅His-tag
CPPs with Freiburg prefix (C-CPP): His-tag⋅gene⋅CPP
A His-tag (BBa_K157011) is available from the Registry, carried on the pMA (BBa_K157000) plasmid (pMA.His). This has previously been extracted from one of our iGEM plates, and is available both as plasmid, and as transformed cells.
The CPPs have been requested as synthesized DNA genes, and should arrive soon.
At me and Mimmi's lab, yCCS and SOD are now successfully verified in pSB1C3 and ready for cloning.
Assembly and cloning strategies
Cloning strategy for assembly of N-part prefix CPPs (N-CPP) with protein-coding genes and His tag to form N-CPP⋅gene⋅His-tag, into pSB1C3.
Cloning strategy for assembly of Freiburg prefix CPPs (C-CPP) with protein-coding genes and His tag to form His-tag⋅gene⋅C-CPP, into pSB1C3.
Designed cloning strategies for the assembly of CPP⋅gene⋅His-tag and His-tag⋅gene⋅CPP; see drawings attached. We will use BioBrick 3A assembly, with vectors carrying the RFP cassette as out destination vector. pSB1A3, pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 are already available with RFP, but not yet pEX.

I worked on obtaining material from the Uppsala iGEM-team and also talked to an Uppsala reseach team in Uppsala University Hospital about artificial skin that they might be able to culture and provide to us for testing the penetration capacity of our future fusion proteins with CPP.
