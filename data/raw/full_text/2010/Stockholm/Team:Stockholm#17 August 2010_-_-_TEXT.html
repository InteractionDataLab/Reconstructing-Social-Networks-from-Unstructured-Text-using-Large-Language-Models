From 16/8 ON cultures
Elution volume: 70 μl dH2O
Since samples were intended for sequencing, they had to be concentrated in the evaporator. Results in table.
Samples sent for sequencing from VF2 primer annealing site:
15 μl DNA
1.5 μl 10 mM VF2 primer
ON cultures
New ON cultures (5 ml + 25 Cm) were set for plasmid prep from same clones as were sent for sequencing: yC1, yC4, SC1, SC2.
Nina
Colony PCR
I ran the colony PCR from yesterday on an agarose gel 1 % 100 V to screen whether or not there are any successful fusion proteins made up by protein A and IgG protease.
Ladder: GeneRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 100-10,000 bp Fermentas
Arragement on the gel:
Unfortunately I did not obtain any good bands on the gel that would represent the correct gene size. This must mean that something might have gone wrong with the ligation and therefore I will redo the ligation. In addition I will perform a gel clean up of the digested samples in order to not have any material interfering with the ligation.
