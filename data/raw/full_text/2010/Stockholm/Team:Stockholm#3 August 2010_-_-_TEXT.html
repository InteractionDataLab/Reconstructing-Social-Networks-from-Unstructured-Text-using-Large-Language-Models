Cloning
To remove unwanted insertion of a C nucleotide located at the PstI site in the suffix, caused by cloning in the pEX vector, yCCS, SOD and IgG protease will be transferred to a new vector by digestion with SpeI.
Digestion
IgG protease (on pSB1A3)
yCCS A (on pSB1C3)
yCCS B (on pSB1C3)
SOD (on pSB1C3)

Mimmi
MITF
the vector pRc/CMV and the insert MITF
- restriction enzyme
the PCR products (from 2010-08-02) are treated with the restriction enzyme AgeI
the mutated MITF should show two bands: ~1300bp and ~10bp (which you dont see)
the control (non-mutated) MITF should show three bands: ~1060bp, ~200bp and ~10bp (which you don't see)

Overnight culture of Tyrosinase
I inoculated Tyrosinase in its original vector from a glycerol stock (that was sent to us from iGEM hq) in 12 ml LB and added 24 ul amphicillin (50 mg/ml). This was incubated in 37 °C overnight in shake. This will be mini prepped tomorrow.
