Well 4 + 7 no product?
Bad mixing?
over expression continue...
Sonicate the samples on ice. 4X30s with 30s pause in between.
Heat in 95°C for 1m
Centrifuge 13000rpm for 1m
Load 1µl on the comassie mini-gel with a special comb
--> Sample is slimey, DNA in it??
--> Hard to see the differences in the bands
LMWP
glycerol stock + preparation of plasmids
Start cultures from the PCR colonies
