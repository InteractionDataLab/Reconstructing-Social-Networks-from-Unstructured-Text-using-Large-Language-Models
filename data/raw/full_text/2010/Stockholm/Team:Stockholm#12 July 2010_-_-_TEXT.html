Clonings
Gel extractions and DNA clean-up
Continued from 9/7
Gel extracted DNA samples (pEX, BBa_J1893x, SOD and yCCS) and digested DNA samples (pSB1x3) stored in -20°C were purified using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction kit.
Nanodrop measurements revealed extremely low or even nonexistent concentrations of DNA in purified samples. I decided to go ahead with the ligations anyway, as I was confident that there was indeed (correct) DNA present in the samples.
Ligations

Procedures
All insert samples, as well as the pEX vector sample, were concentrated in a vacuum evaporator prior to ligation
2 μl vector
5 μl insert
10 μl 2X Quick Ligase buffer
2 μl dH2O
1 μl Quick Ligase
Incubation 10 min in "RT" (30°C due to the extreme summer heat these days!)
Transformations
Ligated constructs transformed into Top10 and plated onto LB agar plates with relevant antibiotics. pEX.BBa_J1893x constructs also transformed into BL21 cells and plated onto 100 μg/ml Amp with 1 % glucose. Plates incubated ON in 37°C.
