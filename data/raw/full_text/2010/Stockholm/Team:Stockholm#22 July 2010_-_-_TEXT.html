PCR
The PCR samples that was run on a gel to verify that the colonies had been successfully site-directed mutagenesised seemed to be lost, and a new colony PCR was performed to verify the site-directed mutagenesis before cleaving and adding it to the target vectors.
The ladder is FastRuler DNA ladder low range, but the bands does not show the expected size. Did I mistakenly use the FastRuler DNA ladder middle range?
