Vitamin B9 (folic acid)
We are trying to find a proper model for Vitamin B9 production in E. Coli
E. Coli lacks FolQ
[1] and [2] could be intereseting.
KEGG for folate: folate biosynthesis pathway
Enzyme kinetics for folate biosynthesis pathway better to be extracted.
Nina
Tranformation of site directed mutagenesis Tyrosinase
I transformed the site directed mutagenesis Tyrosinase in 100 ul Top 10 cells. The method was according to the procedure in protocols. However in step 1 I thawed the cells for 15 instead of 10 min. In step 2 I added 1 ul of DNA to the cells.

Gel verification
1 % agarose, 70 V, 1 h
Expected bands (plus 333 bp from vector)
IgG protease: 930 bp + 333 bp = 1263 bp
yCCS: 744 bp + 333 bp = 1077 bp
SOD: 459 bp + 333 bp = 792 bp
BBa_J04450: 1069 bp + 317 bp = 1386 bp
Results
Colony PCR gel verification of pSB1C3.IgG prot., pSB1A3.yCCS A & B and pSB1A3.SOD.
Row 1: 1 kb λ, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 1 kb λ
Row 2: 1 kb λ, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 1 kb λ
3 μl λ, 6 μl sample.
Good bands for yCCS A & B and SOD, but not for IgG protease. The latter needs to be re-picked and amplified again.
Sine very strange sequencing results from yCCS A, where the sequence was that of mCherry RFP (BBa_J18932) rather than yCCS, makes me hesitant to whether samples 5-8 and 9-12 are indeed yCCS; since yCCS and mCherry nucleotide sequences are quite similar in length.
I will run a dedicated gel tomorrow to compare yCCS with BBa_J18932 directly.
ON cultures
Clones A & B from yCCS A, yCCS B and SOD were picked for glycerol stock and plasmid prep. ON cultures were set:
5 ml LB + 100 Amp (37 °C, 250 rpm)
3 ml LB + 100 Amp (30 °C)
Plasmid prep
Made plasmid prep of IgG protease ON cultures set 4/8. Samples were discarded since colony PCR showed that the samples were incorrect.
