Johan
Continuation of making competent cells
Step 2-12 in "800 ml of competent cells"
1 L instead of 800 ml -> 25 st 50 ml Falcon Tubes with 40 ml, 1 st with 15-20 ml
10) 16/23 = 0,69 ml
3) Abs:
Only one bottle

12) ~160 epps, 100 ¬µl in each.
They were then all put in the freezer, in two cardboard boxes (no metal blocks used)
