Groups of physically interacting proteins that function in the cell in cooperation and coordination, controlling interrelated processes taking place in the organism, form protein interaction networks. [1]
Construction of interactome maps is also useful for fundamental medicine, namely, for determination of the role of individual proteins and their interactions in emergence and development of diseases and their diagnosis, as well as for identification of possible drug targets and monitoring of treatment efficiency. [2]
It is commonly assumed that pathways in mammals can be inferred through homology to model organisms, e.g. the experimental observation that two yeast proteins interact is transferred to infer that the two corresponding proteins in human also interact(??!??) [3]
