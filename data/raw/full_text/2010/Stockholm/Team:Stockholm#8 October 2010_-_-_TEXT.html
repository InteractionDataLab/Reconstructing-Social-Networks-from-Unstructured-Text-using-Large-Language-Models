Andreas
Short day in lab - birthday celebrations!
Growth curve assay
Inoculated fresh LB with 0.3 mM IPTG with ON cultures to a startup OD of 0.2 and a total volume of 50 ml in 150 ml side-arm E-flasks.
Was advised to use a smaller cultures for the flask size. Experiment canceled after about an hour; will be repeated next week.
Removal of insertion in BioBrick suffixes
Plasmid prep
Spun down pSB1C3.SOD ON culture at 13,000 x g, 10 min. Supernatant discarded and cell pellet stored in -20 °C for later plasmid prep.
Nina
Protein purification
I performed a protein purification of SOD.His (N terminal). The pellet came from an IPTG induced 12 ml overnight culture.
Lysis buffer:
630 ul * 2 = 1260 ul lysis buffer
Wash buffer:
10X lysis buffer  12.6 ml
Elution buffer:
5X lysis buffer 6.3 ml
PMSF
100 * volume = 1260 * 1
12.6 ul PMSF added in lysis buffer
Imidazole
2 * volume = 1260 * 10*10^-3
6.3 ul imidazole added in lysis buffer
Imidazole
2 * volume = 1260 * 20*10^-3
126 ul imidazole added in wash buffer
Lysozyme
The tip of a spoon was added in lysis buffer
DNase
20 ug/ml was added in lysis buffer
column equilibration
The work is carried out in a cold room.
Ni-resin was vortexed and 1 ml was added in a drop column.
5 ml wash buffer was added and run through the column (to equilibrate the Ni-resin).
The lysis mixed with the bacteria pellet was added in the column. However, the mixture seemed to plug the column and nothing could run through.
I left this in the cold room over the weekend to check with anyone at the department what to do and if I still can work with this material.
Mimmi
SOD activity assay
Searching "web of science" for SOD activity assays
Generates O2-
Xanthine + xanthine oxidase
NADH + phenazine methosulphate
riboflavin + methionine
Reacts with O2- and can be measured
cytochrome C
nitro-blue tetrazodium NBT
adrenaline
pyrogallol
hydroxylamine
Catalase-like test?
No, since E. coli are catalase positive and SOD differences will not be detectable
SOD activity test that chemically produces O2-
mix
graded levels of SOD
 ?
Incubate in RT, darkness for 10min
Measure A540
negative control = without NADH
NBT
1mg
phenazine methosulphate
10µg
EDTA
1µM
gelatin
1mg
phosphate
0.1M
NADH 1mM
0.1ml
tot
3ml
pH=7.8
