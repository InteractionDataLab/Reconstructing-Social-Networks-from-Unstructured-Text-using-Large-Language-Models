Mini prep of Tyrosinase
I performed a mini prep on the six samples of falcon tubes containing inoculated tyrosinase in its original vector that have been site directed mutagenesis. The colonies are: #2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ,7 & 8. The method was according to the procedure described under Protocols.
Spectophotometer:
Measuring concentration of protein A (ZZ domain) and IgG protease in bank vector C
I measured the complately digested protein A ZZ domain (PCR product) and the bank vector C that before the digestion contained the IgG protease gene.
Spectophotometer:
Ligation of protein A (ZZ domain) with bank vector C
I ligated protein A ZZ domian into the digested bank vector C to be able to make fusion proteins with IgG protease and CPP but also to send in this part to iGEM hq since they want the genes to be sent in this vector.
The vector concentraion should preferably be 25 ng/ul when performing ligation with a gene.
I used:
bank vector C 0.5 ul
protein A gene 3 ul
quick ligase 1 ul
quicke ligase buffer 2X 3 ul
Incubated in RT 15 min
Transformation of protein A (ZZ domain) in bank vector C
I transformed the ligated protein A (ZZ domain) in bank vector C in 100 ul Top 10 cells.
The transformation method is according to the procedure decribed in protocols. However in the step 1 I thawed for 15 min instead of 10 min. In step 2 I added 3 ul of DNA, in step 6 I used LB instead of SOC and finally in step 10 I spread 50 ul of sample on a chloramphenicol plate.

Cloning of IgG protease
Continued from 9/8 ON plates
Colony PCR
Four clones (A, B, C, D) were picked for colony PCR. Positive control: pSB1C3.BBa_J04450 plasmid. Procedures according to protocol; 1:40 elongation time.
Gel verification
1 % agarose, 90 V, 40 min
Results: Weak and very irregularly sized bands. Probably something wrong with the ligation mixture. New IgGp digestion will be made.

Ligation

† Since I used the ligation protocol from 3/8, I mistakenly calculated that 12.5:2.5 would give a 5:1 insert:vector ratio. However, due to the new digestion volume, this actually led to a 12.5:1 ratio.
Transformation
Transformation into 100 μl comptetent Top10.
Quick-transformation
3 μl ligation mix. Incubation 5 min on ice.
Heat-shock 30 sec in 42 °C. Cells cooled on ice.
100 μl plated onto Cm 25 plate.
Standard transformation
3 μl ligation mix.
Standard protocol transformation procedures.
Plates incubated ON in 37 °C.
