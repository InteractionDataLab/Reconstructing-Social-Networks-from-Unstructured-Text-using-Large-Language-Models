Databases we should choose better not to be predicted databases, such as String, or we can use these type of databases with more care, on the other hand databases which include experimentally proven PPI from small scale or large scale studies seem to be more useful for now. There is also another type of databases that are of interest, are Meta-databases, these are as joint point for different primary databases and integrating them. [1]
A first obstacle to evaluate the reliability of PPIs is the low coverage of the databases for each specific interactome. One way to increase coverage is to integrate data reported by different primary databases.....Once the coverage is the best possible for a given interactome, strategies for selecting reliable PPIs are needed. [2]
two main challenges remain for the field and for database providers: (i) a better filtering of false positives in PPI collections and (ii) an adequate distinction of the biological context that specifies and determines the existence or not of a given PPI at a given biological situation. [3]

Glucose/Amp LB agar plates
Prepared 20 LB agar plates with 100 μg/ml Amp and 1 % glucose for later transformation of BL21 for IPTG induction.
ON cultures
Set duplicate ON cultures of the following, picked from agar plates from 23/6 and 2/7:
pMA.BBa_J18930
pMA.BBa_J18931
pMA.BBa_J18932
pEX
pSB1A3.BBa_J04450
pSB1C3.BBa_J04450
pSB1K3.BBa_J04450
Cultures grown in 5 ml LB with 100 μg/ml Amp (pMA, pEX and pSB1A3), 25 μg/ml Cm (pSB1C3) or 50 μg/ml Km (pSB1K3).
