Nina
Preparation of competent DH5α Escherichia coli cells
Autoclaving bottles & solutions for next day:
Two 1000 ml empty bottles
500 ml 50 mM CaCl2 for 1000 ml cell culture
16 ml 50 mM CaCl2 + 15 % Glycerol
Set a 5 ml LB ON culture of DH5α in 37°C, 250 rpm.
Johan
Autoclaved stuff for making 1000 ml competent cells
Two 2L bottles, each with made 500 ml 50 mM CaCl2
500 ml 50 mM CaCl2
Small bottle with 16 ml CaCl2 + 15 % Glycerol
Made from 87 % Glycerol.
c1 * v1 = c2 * v2
87 % * ? = 15 % * 16 ml
v1 = (15 % * 16 ml) / 87 % = 2,76 ml
2,76 ml 87 % glycerol was diluted with 16 - 2,76 = 13,24 ml 50 mM CaCl2
Step 1 in competent cell protocol
5 ml of LB in each of two 50 ml Falcon tubes.
Pipette tip dipped in commercial NEB5α (=DH5α) cells, then dipped in the Falcon tubes and put in 37 °C shaker.
