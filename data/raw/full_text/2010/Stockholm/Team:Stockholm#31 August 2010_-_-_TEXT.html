Colony PCR
Due to lack of PCR beads only two colonies from each single N-CPP was picked for colony PCR:
Tra10: 10 1 & 10 2
TAT: TA 1 & TA 2
LMWP: LM 1 & LM 2
Neg. contr (NC): Blank
Standard colony PCR procedures. Elongation time: 1:00
Gel verification
Colony PCR gel verification of N-Tra10, N-TAT and N-LMWP.
3 μl λ; 5 μl sample.
λ=O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder
1 % agarose, 110 V
Expected bands
Tra10: 389 bp
TAT: 359 bp
LMWP: 368 bp
Results
Way too large bands, which is very strange. Troubleshooting needed.
Troubleshooting/Gel verification
Gel verification of digested N-CPP and pSB1C3 vector samples.
3μl λ; 5 μl sample
λ=O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder
Ran a gel of N-CPP ligation mixes and digestion samples to verify DNA fragment lengths.
Expected bands
Lig Tra10 (Lig pSB1C3.Tra10 30/8)
2145 bp, 54 bp, 2078 bp
Lig TAT (Lig pSB1C3.TAT 30/8)
2115 bp, 45 bp, 2078 bp
Lig LMWP (Lig pSB1C3.LMWP 30/8)
2124 bp, 75 bp, 2078 bp
Lig N-CPP (Lig pSB1C3.N-CPP 30/8)
2124 bp, 2115 bp, 2145 bp, 54 bp, 45 bp, 75 bp, 2078 bp etc.
Dig X+A (Dig pSB1C3 X+A EXTR (from 9/8))
2078 bp
Dig N+S (Dig pSB1C3 N+S EXTR (from 9/8))
2076 bp
Results
As expected a 2078/2076 bp digested pSB1C3 fragment appeared in all samples. Apart from the ≈4 kb fragment in "Lig N-CPP" no bands are visible. This could mean that no other sizes are present; however, since almost all expected bands were very small, it is also possible that they can't be visualized by gel verification. Not many conclusions can be drawn from this.
LB agar plates
Prepared 20 x LB agar plates with 25 μg/ml Cm.
