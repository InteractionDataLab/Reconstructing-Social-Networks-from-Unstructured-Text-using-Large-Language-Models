Cloning of N-CPPs into pSB1C3
Transformation results
From 3/9
More growth on the 2 μl plate than on the 5 μl plate, indicating what I already suspected: contamination in transformation. Discarded both plates and restarted cloning.
Digestion

Control digestions
Did two control digestions to analyze the N-CPP plasmid vector size.

Gel verification
Gel verification of N-CPP plasmid digestions.
1 kb λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder; 50 bp λ = GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder.
1 % agarose, 120 V, 40 min
N-CPP: undigested N-CPP plasmid
Dig X+A: N-CPP plasmid digested with XbaI & AgeI
Dig ApaI: Linearized N-CPP plasmid digested with ApaI
Dig S+A: N-CPP plasmid digested with SmaI and ApaI, excising the 391 bp N-CPP cluster.
Results
Linearized plasmid seems to be ≈5 kb long. Undigested plasmid moved slower; this was probably the result of the lane being too crowded.

† Accidentally added 2 μl FastAP alkaline phosphatase to ligation mix 1. Enzyme inactivated at 75 °C, 10 min, prior to ligation.
Incubation: 22 °C, 10 min
Transformation
Performed by Mimmi
Standard transformation, except:
30 min incubation in 37 °C
3 μl ligation mix
Cells grown on Cm 25 plates.
PCR
Since we've experienced some problems with our N-CPP clonings, a PCR of each individual N-CPP was performed for individual cloning, in case the current cloning doesn't work.
