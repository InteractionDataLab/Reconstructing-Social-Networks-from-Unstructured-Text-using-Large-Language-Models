Incubation: 37 °C, 1 h
Gel verification
Gel verification of sample digestions.
4 μl λ; 3 μl sample.
1 kb λ = O'GeneRuler 1 kb DNA ladder. 50 bp λ = GeneRuler 50 bp DNA ladder.
Due to the risk of pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS and pEX.N-TAT⋅SOD⋅His having previously been mixed up, a gel was run on the digested samples (after 15 min incubation) to verify the excised insert size. Remaining samples were also run on the gel to verify digestion.
1 % agarose, 120 V
Expected bands
pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS X+P: 806 bp, 2061 bp
pEX.N-TAT⋅SOD⋅His X+P: 558 bp, 4453 bp
pSB1K3.N-TAT⋅SOD⋅His S+P: ≈2730 bp
pSB1K3.N-Tra10⋅SOD⋅His X+P: 588 bp, 2188 bp
pSB1K3.N-Tra10⋅SOD⋅His S+P: ≈2760 bp
pSB1C3.N-LMWP⋅SOD⋅His X+P: 567 bp, 2054 bp
pSB1C3.N-LMWP⋅SOD⋅His S+P: ≈2610 bp
pEX.RFP X+P: 1095 bp, 4453 bp
Results
Seemingly correct bands for samples 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8. More unsure results for 6 and 7, while 2 seems to contain more than one insert, or has been digested at several places.
Nina
Overnight culture
I inoculated protein A#5_TAT, _LMWP & _Tra10 all from colony #1 on each dish.
12 ml LB + 24 ul chloramphenicol.
Concentration measurement
Protein A#5_CPP_TAT_C cons: 95ng/ul 95/10 = 9.5ng/ul λ260 0.019 λ280 0.009 λ315 -0.002
Vector with CPP_TAT_C conc: 95 ng/ul
95ng/ul * Volume = 25ng/ul * 5 ul
Volume = 1.3 ul sample and fill up to 5 ml with H2O.
IgG N+P cons: 30ng/ul 30/2.5 = 12ng/ul λ260 0.007 λ280 0.006 λ315 0.000
IgG A+E cons: 40ng/ul 40/2.5 = 16ng/ul λ260 0.007 λ280 0.007 λ315 0.001
Ligation

Digestion
H2O 15 ul
Fastdigest buffer 10X 2 ul
DNA 2 ul
Restriction enzyme NgoMIV 1 ul
Restriction enzyme PstI 1 ul (Add after 1.5 h incubation in 37 °C and incubate in 30 min)
Inactivate in 80 °C for 30 min.
Added CIAP 1 ul and incubate 1 h in 37 °C.

Gel purification
A gel was run with pMA (vector with histag) cut before and after his, and bFGF cut before and after
A gel purification was then performed on all samples.
Abs:
bFGF-his: 14 ng/µl his-bFGF: 18 ng/µl pMA before: 22 ng/µl pMA after: 30 ng /µl
Ligation
bFGF after & pMA before
bFGF before & pMA after
5 µl insert
3 µl vector
1 µl T4 ligase
2 µl 10x buffer
9 µl H2O
Transformation
3 µl of all constructs was transformed into top10 cells.
