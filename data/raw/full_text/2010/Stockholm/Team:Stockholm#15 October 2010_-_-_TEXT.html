Continuation of protein purification
Washing
I washed the column with 10 X volumes of wash buffer.
The Ni-resin (in the form of pellet) is 10 ml, therefore 10 * 10ml Ni-NTA = 100 ml wash buffer.
The imidazole is 2 M.
2M * Volume = 100 * 30 *10^-3 M   Volume imidaziole that needs to be added in the wash 100 ml is 1.5 ml
Washing:
Elution
I eluted the column with 5 X volumes of elution buffer.
The Ni-resin (in the form of pellet) is 10 ml, therefore 5 * 10ml Ni-NTA = 50 ml elution buffer.
20 ml 40 min on shake 4°C
10 ml 30 min on shake 4°C
10 ml 30 min on shake 4°C
10 ml 30 min on shake 4°C
I saved these samples in the cold room 4°C for tomorrow.
Agarose gel verification
I ran the PCR products on an 1 % agarose gel 80 V to check if I had any inserts.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arrangement on gel:
Gels:
Unfortunately non of the bands show that there has been an insert, it might be that the transformation into BL21 cells was not a good idea since they are not cloning cells, but we are short on time and I tried to make a short cut. It might have failed this time. I will run a new screen with 16 colonies/dish, it that won't work then this cloning has not worked out well.

Growth curve assay
Setup
Inoculated new flasks from ON cultures set 14/10:
250 ml E-flasks
25 ml LB + Amp 100 + 1 mM IPTG
250 μl ON culture
BL21 pEX.SOD⋅His
BL21 pEX.nTra10⋅SOD⋅His
BL21 pEX.nTAT⋅SOD⋅His
BL21 pEX.nLMWP⋅SOD⋅His
37 °C, 225 rpm
OD590 measurements made every 30 min with appropriate dilution in fresh LB.

Results
Results indicate no significant difference in growth between different cultures. Slightly lower curve for the nTra10-expressing clone, which is somewhat interesting, since a similar progress was seen in the canceled experiment from 14/10. At least one more experiment will be run next week, using new BL21 clones; this will show whether this is just a coincidence or not.
