Growth on Amp plate indicated transformation competence. No growth on other plates indicated good antibiotic selection.
Note: The transformed pEX vector was thought to carry a Cm resistance cassette insert. This was, however, discovered to be wrong.
Plasmid preparation of pEX vector
Two clones picked and each inoculated in 5 ml LB with Amp and grown ON in 37°C, 250 rpm.
Transformation with pMA vector
The pMA (BBa_K157000) vector could become useful for cloning and construction of our parts, as it carries the complete Freiburg prefix and suffix sequences (in contrast to the standard BioBrick vectors pSB1x3).
Transformed Top10 cells with pMA vector carrying a Freiburg fusion His tag (BBa_K157011) insert. Cells plated on 100 ug/ml Amp plates.
Hassan
Started to use softwares for making 3D animations and/or movies, started by making protein A and IgG Protease.
softwares used:
