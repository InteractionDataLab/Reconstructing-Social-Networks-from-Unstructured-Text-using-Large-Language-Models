Comment
pEX.N-TAT⋅SOD⋅His 3
pEX.nTAT.SOD.his 3_premix
Blastn
Verified. Three silent mutations in His tag; does not alter a.a. sequence.
pEX.N-TAT⋅SOD⋅His 4
pEX.nTAT.SOD.his 4_premix
Blastn
Not verified. Incorrect construct.
pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS 3
pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS 3_premix
Blastn
Partly verified. Three mutations found: (1) Single base deletion in yCCS sequence, causing a frame shift and an extended open reading frame; (2) Insertion between SpeI and PstI, not affecting expression of cloning; (3) Point mutation in PstI site, disabling PstI restriction. Mutations (1) and (3) are both quite unsure, as the sequencing quality in this area is very low. New sequencing from VR will be sent.
pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS 4
pSB1A2.RBS.yCCS 4_premix
Blastn
Partly verified. Four mutations found: (1) Point mutation changing a K codon to T; (2) Single base deletion in yCCS sequence, causing frame shift; (3) Insertion between SpeI and PstI, not affecting expression of cloning; (4) Point mutation in PstI site, disabling PstI restriction. See comment

Plasmid prep
From 28/9 ON cultures
Spun down ON cultures 10 min, 3000 x g. Decanted supernatant and stored pellets in -20 °C ON for later plasmid prep.
Sorting glycerol stocks
Started sorting our glycerol stocks into a spreadsheet for future reference.
Nina
Agarose gel verificaion
I ran an agarose gel 1 % 100 V on the colony PCR products from yesterday to check if I had any inserts.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arrangement on gel:
From left to right: 1-5 fusion EA, 1-5 Fusion NS, 1-5 IgG LMWP, 1-5 IgG_TAT_N, 1-5 IgG_Tra10_N, 1-5 IgG_TAT_C, 1-5 Protein A_TAT_C, 1-5 pEX, 1-9 pEX
Colony PCR
I ran a new colony PCR on the samples I did not have a possitive result on from the gel above.
The samples for this screen are:
IgG_LMWP_N, _TAT_N, _Tra10_N, protein A_LMWP_N_pex, _TAT_N_pex & _Tra10_N_pex
I screened 8 colonies/dish.
PCR master mix:
MgCl2 8ul
phusion buffer 5X 80ul
dNTP 8ul
primerR 24ul
primerF 24ul
polymerase 8ul
H2O 240ul
Agarose gel verificaion
I ran an agarose gel 1 % 100 V on the colony PCR products from yesterday to check if I had any inserts.
Ladder: MassRuler™ DNA Ladder Mix, ready-to-use, 80-10,000 bp
Arrangement on gel:
Overnight culture
I inoculated Fusion EA colony 1 & 3 and Fusion NS colony 1 & 2 each in 12 ml LB with 24 ul chloramphenicol resistance.
Digestion
I digested IgG protease and protein A in the bank vector C in order to perform a gel clean up of the genes and insert them into a pMa-His AS vector.
Digestion:
H2O 15 ul
DNA 2 ul
Fastdigest buffer 10X 2 ul
Restriction enzyme NgoMIV 1 ul
Restriction enzyme SpeI 1 ul (Add after 1.5h incubation in 37 °C)
Mimmi
