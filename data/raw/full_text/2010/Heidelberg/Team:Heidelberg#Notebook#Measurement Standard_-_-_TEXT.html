seeding cells for test measurements - 96 well plate for plate-reader and FACS
cells were grown in DMEM 10%FBS with phenol red
washed with PBS
trypsinised (2 ml trypsin)
5ml of OptiMEM media (no FBS) added
counted cells: HeLa 3.8*10^6 cells/ml, HEK 3.3*10^6 cells/ml, HEK T-Rex 1.5*10^6 cells/ml, Huh7 0.8*10^6 cells/ml

media: DMEM +L-Glu +PenStrep +10%FBS, OptiMEM +PenStrep, OptiMEM +PenStrep +2%FBS
in all wells where T-Rex cells were seeded zeocin and blasticin were added, in wells with Huh7 cells - non essential amino acids
-> cells did not adhere well, coat plate with poly-L-lysine and repeat

seeding 1 96-well plate with all different cell lines we have (HelaP4, Hek293T and Huh7) for testing fluorescent measurement:
purpose is to set up plate reader (TECAN), FACS and microscope and test whether it is possible to distinguish between GFP and BFP expression
problem: forgot to coat the plate, therefore cells did not attach

transfection of cells for fluorescent measurement (EGFP and EBFP2):
set-up of the plate:
non-transfected cell line
each cell line transfected with EGFP control plasmid
each cell line transfected with EBFP2 control plasmid

Results:
too little cells have been plated
Huh7 cells are hard to transfect
expression of EBFP2 is much lower than expression of EGFP

seeding 2 96-well plates with 5000 cells each well:
test whether tuning construct is properly expressing firefly and renilla luciferase and thereby testing whether every part is functional
21/09/2010
transfection of both 96-well plates with K1-K8:
transfect 50ng of each construct
check for promoter strength and functionality of the constructs

relative expression units(REU) of firefly luciferase compared to renilla luciferase of the different tuning consstructs without any binding sites for the expressed shRNA10
File:22092010promoters2.jpg
comparison of REU of firefly to renilla luciferase in the different cell lines
dual luciferase assay on the 2 96-well plates:
all constructs are functional as firefly and renilla luciferase are expressed
transfection of construct into Hek t-Rex cells reveals that the CMVTetO2 (construct K4) is also functional as the expression of firefly to renilla counts is nearly zero

who deleted what I wrote here??? hallooo?? hmm I guess I just didn't save it. damn.
23/10/2010
measurement of Hela and Hek Cells transfected with miMeasure M12-M22. Four conditions were transfected with four replicates each: a = not cotransfected, b = cotransfected with miRsAg on pcDNA5, c = cotransfected with empty pcDNA5 (CMV promoter), d = cotransfected with pcDNA5 containing different shRNA (shRNA3 from Elena).
because of a contamination, not all replicates could be considered. Plates were screened for positive transfections
cells were trypsinated (30µl Trypsin) for 10min and then resuspended with 170µl PBS/BSA. Replicates for each condition were pooled into 24 well plates.
200µl of each was transferred to a 96 well plate for FACS measurement.
100µl of each was used for confocal analysis
how do I get a calendar in here??? anyone?? ⇐ Main Page
