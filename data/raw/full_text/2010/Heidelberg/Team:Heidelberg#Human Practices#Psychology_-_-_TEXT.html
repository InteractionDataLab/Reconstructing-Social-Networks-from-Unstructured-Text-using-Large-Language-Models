Psychological Survey
The psychological part of the human practice project 2010 consists of two connected parts:  The first part was the construction of a questionnaire to measure people’s acceptance toward synthetic biology. Constructing a questionnaire not just means inventing some questions and putting them together. From the psychometrical point of view constructing a questionnaire means sticking to a determined constructing principle, passing through different steps of construction and estimating statistical values to evaluate the worth of the questionnaire. My claim for this part was to construct a good and methodical correct questionnaire that can be used in future research.   If you want to know how we constructed the questionnaire, please click here:
Construction of the questionnaire
 
To have a look at the finished questionnaire, click here:
The SynBio-Questionnaire
 
The second part builds on the first part in using the constructed questionnaire. The aim was to prove the relationship between knowledge of synthetic biology and its acceptance. For that we invited 71 participants and divided them into three groups. Each group got another kind of knowledge respective to synthetic biology: the first group got just a basic knowledge, the second group got funded theoretical knowledge and the third group received theoretical and practical knowledge. Afterwards every participant had to fill in the questionnaire referring the acceptance of SynBio.   If you are interested in the results of our experiment please have a look:
