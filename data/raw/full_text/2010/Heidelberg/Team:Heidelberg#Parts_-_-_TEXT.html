miBricks - Parts submitted to the registry
The parts we submit belong to the two core aims our project: Reaching regulatory control (1) and specificity (2) of gene expression of any gene of interest in any target cell or tissue of choice. Therefore we engineered parts, that address these two aims on two different regulatory levels.
First, we engineered gene therapy vectors based on synthetic adeno associated viruses (AAVs). On parts level, we provide about 50 plasmids that can be used for creating shuffled AAV libraries or even rationally designed, recombinant AAV vectors. Those parts we refer to as virobytes, are designed in a format directly applicable for the Virobytes Assembly protocol we develop.
On RNA level we provide the miTuner toolkit consisting of roughly 60 parts enabling gene expression control based on synthetic or cell-specific endogenous microRNAs. This toolkit consists of three main constructs: The pSMB_miMeasure binding site characterization standard and two pSMB_miTuner expression controlling plasmids. Furthermore, it contains 12 basic and 28 intermediate construction parts, synthetic, single microRNA binding sites as well as binding site patterns in BB-2 ( RFC 12 , Tom Knight) standard. This enables maximum flexibility for applications in many different contexts.
