PCR cycle = virbite:
30s @98°C
1m20s @72°C
cycle 35x
4°C forever
Results of the first PCR. 8 fragments of each AAV capsid were amplified.
10/09/2010
Results of the second PCR. Fragment 5 from AAV1 as well as fragment 1 from AAV8 were amplified.
13/09/2010
All fragments (F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8) from AAV cap1,2,5,6,8,9 were combined. Therefore 8 fragment mixes ready for restriction digest with Bsa1 were obtained. 2ul of PCR amplified fragments were taken for the restriction (NanoDrop analysis showed 1ug of DNA of each of six AAVs giving 6-7ug in total per virobyte).
Bsa1 digestion:
6x2ul of DNA
3ul NEB4 10x buffer
3ul BSA 10x
11ul H2O
=30ul total
digest at 37°C for 1hr
heat inactivation at 65°C for 20min
14/09/2010
All fragments from previous day were washed with QIAquick nucleotide removal kit and the DNA was dissolved in 30ul H2O
Anchor stock solution: Anchor oligos 12689 (150ul) and 5 (30ul) were added to Anchor_comp_all (180ul). The mixture was diluted 10x and then heated to 95°C for 2min and subsequently left to slowly cool down to room temperature on a heating block.
15/09/2010
Streptavidin beads M-280, M-270, MyOne C1 and MyOne T1 activated in two replicates:
wash twice with 75ul of wash/binding buffer and once with 75ul of 1x ligase buffer
20ul of Anchor to the bead solution
incubated at RT for 1hr
magnet applied until the solutions cleared out (M-270 is a bit slower) and the solution discarded
wash twice with 75ul of wash/binding buffer and once with 75ul of 1x ligase buffer
ViroByte addition started with F1, F2, F3 ,F4 and F5 following the standard protocol:
add 20ul of Fragment X
resuspend the beads
add 2.3ul of 10x ligase buffer
add 1ul of T4 ligase
incubate at room temperature for 1hr (shake to avoid beads precipitation)
16/09/2010
last three (F6, F7, F8) fragments added
red replicates washed twice with 75ul W/B buffer and once with 75 ul 1x ligase buffer and diluted to 40ul water
blue replicates washed according to same protocol and diluted into 35ul
PCR amplification with beads:
25ul Phusion 2x mix
20ul of red replicate DNA solution
0.5ul of virbyte_for
0.5ul virbite_rev
4ul water
Cycle = virbyte amp:
30s 94°C
30s 65°C
1m30s 72°C
4°C forever
HindIII digest from beads for blue replicates:
35ul beads solution
4ul NEB2 10x
1ul HindIII
incubate at 37°C for 1hr
inactivate at 65°C for 20min
blue replicate PCR:
25ul Phusion 2x mix
20ul of digest blue replicate DNA solution
0.5ul virbyte_for
0.5ul virbite_rev
4ul water
Cycle - virbyte amp
