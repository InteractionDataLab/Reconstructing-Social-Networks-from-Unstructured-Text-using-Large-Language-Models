Binding Site Design
Introduction
To create binding site (BS) patterns for micro RNAs (miRNAs) , we used the random assembly PCR (raPCR) – method from iGEM2009-Heidelberg team ( see here ) and adopted it to our purposes. The differences:
Sequences from 100 to 400 base pairs are requested.
Oligos span over a whole binding site for a certain miRNA and shuffling occurs on the level of pattern creation.
Several points need to be considered for setting up miRNA-binding site (miRBS) patterns:
the right distance after the stop codon for efficient (or non-efficient) BS recognition
distance and sequence between miRBS (the spacer)
See on our Notebook pages how we created binding site patterns.
The adopted method for BS-patterns can be found on our methods page .
On the Parts -Page you can find standardized BS-patterns for hsa-mir-122 and has-mir-221, containing at least 2 binding sites.
