01/10/2010
reasonable number of colonies on each plate
pick 8 colonies of each construct --> 32 colonies
colony PCR
7 minipreps of promising candidates and sent for sequencing
02/10/2010
digest pSB1C3 with DpnI, EcoRI, PstI
digest pSB1A3 with DpnI, EcoRI, PstI
digest 4x pSB1C3 (5 µL BSA, NEB buffer 2, 1 µL PstI, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL DpnI, 1µg construct = 4 µL construct, 33 µL H2O)
digest 4x pSB1A3 (5 µL BSA, NEB buffer 2, 1 µL PstI, 1 µL EcoRI, 1 µL DpnI, 1µg construct = 4 µL construct, 33 µL H2O)
03/10/2010
Ligation of miR221, 1179 and 4286 raPCRs to pSB1C3 backbone (each 0S, 0L, 10S, 10L) using quick ligase and plate to chloramp. LB-plates
04/10/2010
colony PCRs of the miR221, 1179 and 4286 did not show any nice results. Set up 20 minipreps anyway
05/10/2010
digest 1µg of all binding sites (1A, 3F, 1_3, 1_5, 1_7, 1_7, 3_7) with:
EcoRI
PstI
buffer2
BSA
to ligate in miMeasure
06/10/2010
Restriction digest of successful sequenced miRBS for miR122ran, 221, 1179  (they are in pSB1C3 backbone). 500ng with 1 µL EcoRI/PstI
Set up Minipreps for miRBS for miR122 and miMeasure construct (6 ml LB) in the morning. Miniprep in the evening.
Those Minipreps were transfected to HUH7, HEPG2 and Hepa 1.6 cells using fugene transfectand (see Measurement notebook and figure below).
raPCR of miR320b has not shown a nice smear. Will be trashed and repeated.
20 Minis
tranfect cells
07/10/2010
Ligation of succesful sequenced miRBS of miR122ran, 221, 1179  (10 in total)
13/10/2010
digest miMeasure with PstI and EcoRI
digest 16 different raPCRs (8x miR230b, 8x 4286)
ligate 16 binding site patterns into miMeasure
transform newly ligated constructs
14/10/2010
a reasonable
Screening of 40 colonies of miR4286 (colony PCR)
Screening of 32 colonies of miR320b (colony PCR)
