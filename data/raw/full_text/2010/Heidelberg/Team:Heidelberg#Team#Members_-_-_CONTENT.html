His new engagement in the up-coming field of Synthetic Biology underlines the need for tight interdisciplinary work between experimentalists and theoreticians.

He read for a Bachelors degree in Physics at Imperial College London and a Masters degree in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Subsequently, he completed his PhD in Theoretical Physics at the University of Oxford focusing on modelling complex adaptive systems, trying to analytically understand the emergence of complex behaviour. Since, his research interests have endeavoured to apply the tools and methodologies of Physics to the field of Systems Biology where his focus lies in modelling various intra- and intercellular interactions using agent-based modelling, whilst shedding light on the multi-scalability of models.</P></DIV><DIV class="profile" id="Joel_Beaudouin"><DIV class="t3"><A name="Joel_Beaudouin">PhD Joel Beaudouin</A></DIV><P>Joel is a postdoc in Prof. Eils' group at the University of Heidelberg and the DKFZ.

As a PhD student in the Dept. of Infectious Diseases (Virology, Prof. Kräusslich), she is currently wrapping up her thesis in which she has utilized and substantially improved high-throughput, high-content RNAi screening technologies to identify novel human host factors (proteins and miRNAs) that play an essential role during the HIV-1 life cycle. The unique chance to apply different facets of her own education to a thrilling innovative and interdisciplinary project, combined with the rewarding option to use her technical knowledge and distinctive expertise with miRNA research to support and tutor an inspired group of upcoming synthetic biologists, make her especially proud and delighted to be an integral part of Heidelberg's iGEM 2010 advisor team.</P></DIV><DIV class="profile" id="Paula_Gonzalez"><DIV class="t3"><A name="Paula_Gonzalez">Paula Gonzalez</A></DIV><P>Paula is a PhD student in the group of Roland Eils and is currently working on developing optical methods to study intracellular mechanical properties. Originally from Mexico, she came to Heidelberg to pursue her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Molecular Biotechnology, where she learned an interdisciplinary way to analyze biological systems. She's helping the IGEM 2010 students with the measurements at the microscope and the subsequent image analysis to extract quantitative information. Paula sees IGEM as a wonderful opportunity for students to manage and organize their own project, develop problem solving skills and learn more about the interesting field of synthetic biology. She's very happy to be a part of it!</P></DIV><DIV class="profile" id="Marina_Bechtle"><DIV class="t3"><A name="Marina_Bechtle">Marina Bechtle</A></DIV><P>Marina joined the Bachelor and Master Studies of <B>Molecular Biotechnology</B> at the University of Heidelberg. Finally, she is doing her Master Thesis in the group of Dr. Dirk Grimm. She is mostly interested and fascinated about the virology field, the possibility to predict experiments by computational calculations and then verify them by experimental setups. As her thesis overlaps with the topic of this year's iGEM team, she is glad to help out with useful ideas about virus engineering and to be a part of the iGEM team 2010.</P></DIV><DIV class="backtop"><A href="#top">↑</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
