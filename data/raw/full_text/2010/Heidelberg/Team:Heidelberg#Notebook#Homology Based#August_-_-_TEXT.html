Homology Based Capsid Shuffling
31/08/2010
we decided to use AAV serotypes 1,2,5,6,8 and 9 as those have been described in the literature to infect pancreas cells.
cap plasmids (AAV 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9) have been diluted to a concentration of 200ng/ul
PCR on cap genes was performed using M13 primers as the genes are in the pBluescript vector:
AAV1 A
AAV2 A & B
AAV5 A & B
AAV6
AAV8 A & B
AAV9 A
