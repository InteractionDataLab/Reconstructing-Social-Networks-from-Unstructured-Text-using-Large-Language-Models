seeding cells for test measurements - 96 well plate for plate-reader and FACS
test of media:
OptiMEM 0% FBS + Pen/Strep + L-Glu + other according to cell line
OptiMEM 2% FBS + Pen/Strep + L-Glu + other according to cell line
DMEM 10% FBS+ Pen/Strep + L-Glu + other according to cell line
cells did not adhere properly so we decided to coat 96-well plate with poly-L-lysine and repeat
significantly better growth in DMEM with 10% FBS, so we decided to grow cells in it and before measurement to change it to OptiMEM, to reduce high background fluorescence coming from FBS.
