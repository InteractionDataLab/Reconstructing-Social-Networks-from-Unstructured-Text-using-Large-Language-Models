First concept
biosafety:
biosecurity:
meaningfulness (?): Is the project a waste of money, time and knowhow? Best example for such projects can be find here .
Should it be allowed that students are working on such dangerous and maybe far-reaching projects? Demur of several german newspapers like the ZEIT or
Ethical problems if specific method getting patented
Problem: imprecise, broad and vague; have to create a checklist on my own - none known yet; have to acquaint myself with the methods of the wetlab - very precise knowledge is condition
This approach was dismissed. Too unprecise. Too much work for too less outcome. Canceling of the former wetlab-project.
Second concept
The canceling of the former wetlab-project and deciding for the new project gives the ethical reflexion new possibilities especially because the team wants to work with mice. So there is a wide and grown field of ethical discussion and reflexion about animal experiments. I can use the literature and the highly emotional discussion as basis for the reflexion on the specific wetlab-project.
introduction into animal experiments in the context of the bioethics
outlining the two major positions
freedom of research
elaborating the legal status in Germany (Binder: Rahmenbedingungen) and States - comparison
main arguments
rights of animals
status-quo: experiments, meat-production, etc. - klarmachen wie die gelebte Wirklichkeit(?) ist und sich nicht auf theoretische standpunkte zurückziehen
elaborating the legal status
ethical concepts:
Peter Singer
Hans Jonas
Is there any ethical 'theory' which refers to our every-day behavior? Maybe Descartes!
first conclusion
outlining iGEM-project and wetlab
what is the aim? outlining the main parts
what would be the advantage/benefit for the men?
what will be precise be done with the mice and what will it do to them? do they harm them? will they feel pain? will the experiment probably kill them?
how necessary is the usage of mice for the project? are there alternatives and if it so why they aren't realized?
appreciation
the common definitions and positions will be related to the specific situation in the wetlab

Collection of thoughts and quotations
abstract over animal experiments in the genetics<ref>Nuffield S. 69ff.</ref>
Template:Rquote
great article about animal rights ; good abstract on the development of the ideas (Bentham, Locke, Kant, etc.)
100 Mill. $ were caused by "eco-terrorist" in USA - believable source ?
animal liberation seems to be a "hot" topic in the USA; broad debate; many activists and groups; but also many experiments
there is a special law against "eco-terrorist" and "animal liberation extremists": Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act
obviously there are disruptions inside of the animal rights movement - PETA calls themselves just as a animal protection movement
special unit by the FBI against "eco-terrorists" and radical animal liberator: Operation Blackfire
scheint ein ziemlicher skandal in USA gewesen zu sein: Tests an Primaten in Cambridge in 2002
UNABOMBER!
german legislation: Tierschutzrecht Abschnitt 5
EU legislation:
american legislation:
letzter Tierschutzbericht der Bundesregierung 2007
the protection of animals/animal rights (Tierschutz) becomes in 2007 a national objective with constitutional status
same helpful links: Animal testing regulations also divided in different nations; Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ; Animal Testing - broad and seems to be good
dolphins are non-human persons (!)
gute Seite: EBRA
guter Überblick zur dt. Situation: WIKI
Kommentar zur Farm Bill
nicht den BEricht zu Tierversuchen vom BMELV vergessen!
