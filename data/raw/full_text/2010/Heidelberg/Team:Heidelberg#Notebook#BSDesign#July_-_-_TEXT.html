Binding Site Design - July
05/07/2010 - 11/07/2010
Preperation of chemically competent cells E. coli Top10 and DH5alpha
plating of E. coli Top10 and DH5alpha on a agar plate (LB, without Amp); Preperation of competent cells according to the following protocol:
First, a 20 ml over night culture was inoculated in antibiotic free LB medium from a fresh single colony and transferred into 400 ml antibiotic free LB  medium the next day. This culture was incubated at 37 °C while shacking until an OD600 of 0.5 – 0.6 was achieved. The culture was than cooled down on ice, centrifuged (8 min, 4 °C, 3500 rpm), the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in 10 ml 100 mM CaCl2. After addition of further 190 ml 100 mM CaCl2 the suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was than again centrifuged (8 min, 4 °C, 3500 rpm), the supernatant discarded, the pellet resuspended in 20 ml 82.5 mM CaCl2 with 17.5 % glycerol and aliquoted. The aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and than stored at -80 °C until usage.
Cell Culture Starting
thawing of Huh-7, HeLa p4 and HEK-293 cells according to the following protocol
vials from liquid nitrogen were thawn at 37 °C
once, the probe was nearly completely thawn, cells were thrown into pre-warmed DMEM (10 % FCS, L-Glut, P/S) and gentely mixed
cells were spinned down at 800 rpm, 3 min; supernatant was discarded
the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml DMEM an plated on a p100 cell culture dish in the following media according to the different cell lines:
Media for Hela and Hek cells:
DMEM with 10 % FCS, 1 % L-Glut and 1 % P/S
Media for HUH-7 cells:
DMEM with 10 % FCS, 1 % L-Glut and 1 % P/S and 1 % non-essential amino acids
from now on, cells were kept constantly in culture during the whole iGEM for passaging cells, the cells were split according to the following protocol:
remove media
wash cells one time in PBS (10 ml for p100 dish)
remove PBS; add 1-3 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate cells for 5 min at 37 °C
add 5 ml of the according media
take 1/10th of the cell suspension and plate out on the according dish (either p100 dish, 6 well plate or T-flask)
12/07/2010 - 19/07/2010
Preperation of RNA extracts for miRNA profiling
Hela, Hek and HUH were plated on p100 dishes in their according media (10E6 cells/dish) and grown to 60-70 % confluence
Infection of Hela p4, HUH-7 and HEK cells with AAV serotype 2 (GFP) and incubation for 48 h
afterwards, RNA Extraction was performed according to the following protocol:
Protocol
Samples were afterwards analyzed for miRNA expression by using the FEBIT miRNA profiling service
pSB1AC3 from the registry was transformed into Top10 cells according to the standard transformation protocol; a day later, a 5 ml LB culture was inocculated and incubated for 8 hours; plasmid was extracted by applying the Qiagen MiniPrep Protocol
design of diraPCR oligos
a diraPCR Designer tool (called miRACLE Designer) was programmed for enabling quick&easy design of diraPCR oligos. The program takes any microRNA guiding strand sequence of choice and constructs synthetic microRNA binding site oligos. Those oligos have the following properties:
they have a 5' and 3' anealing sequence which is inerte (has no natural microRNA target)
the microRNA binding site of choice with randomized nucleotides at position 9-12 and a missmatch introduced at position 0
an inerte spacer sequence of 0, 5 10 or 15 bp length
The miRACLE Designer constructs a set of 8 ready-to-order oligos and prints them out in the common FASTA format. When performing diraPCR, binding sites will be concatomerized with spacer sequences in between 15 and 30 bp length.
design of measurement standard
in order to design an appropriety standard respecting all the rules according to the standard of mammalian synthetic biology (RFC12), we developed a dual reporter measurement construct with the following properties:
bidirectional CMV promoter driving both reporter genes
distabilized EGFP and EBFP2 as reporter genes, as they are really similar in their whole structure and amino-acid sequence
BBB prefix and suffix cloned behind the EGFP for easy swapping of binding site patterns
unique BamHI and HindIII binding sites introduced behind the EBFP2 reporter for introducing a reference binding site
strong SV40 terminators behind both reporters
vector backbone, containing an Amp resistance, Hygromycin resistance, pBR322 origin and an FRT site for stable integration
please, find more information about the measurement standard design in the measurment standard page

single binding site synthesis
In order to construct a database of synthetic single binding sites, we developed and optimized a standardized single binding site synthesis protocol;
The band at ~60 bp shows the synthesized single binding sites. For mir-886 and mir-122 there were some unspecific products or multimers obtained.
Protocol 1:
set up the following reaction
1 ul of each single binding site oligo (100 uM) has-mir-886-3p, hsa-mir-886-3p(perf), hsa-mir-769-5p, hsa-mir-769-5p(perf), hsa-mir-122, hsa-mir-122(perf)

The 200, 400 and 1000 bp cloning products were analyzed in an analytic PCR. Only The very first sample of the 200 bp product seems to be positive, as it shows a higher band (~ 300 bp) compared to the religated vector product band at ~ 200 bp

PCR products were analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel, run for 45 min @ 135 V
Single Binding Site Synthesis - Optimization
Further optimization of the single binding site synthesis protocol
The unspecific or multimer side products were clearly reduced, but there is still sime unwanted, longer product in case of mir-122.
Protocol 2:
set up the exact same reaction as on the day before, but using an anealing temperature of 65 °C
analysis of the result on a 2 % agarose gel, run 45 min @ 135 V
28/07/2010
Nearly no unspecific/longer products can be seen. Thus, the synthesis protocol has been perfectly optimized.
Further optimization of the single binding site synthesis protocol
set up the following reaction
1 ul of each single binding site oligo (100 uM) has-mir-886-3p, hsa-mir-122
0.5 ul of SBSSSS_EcoRI primer (reverse strand synthesis primer)
23 ul of water
25 ul of Phusion PCR MasterMix
negative controls were performed with either the SBSSSS_EcoRI primer or the binding site oligos
run PCR under the follwing different conditions
a) 30 cycles, annealing temperature 68 °C constant
b) touchdown PCR 68 °C (- 0.5°C each cycle)
c) incubation for 1 h @ 37 °C, then 30 cycle PCR with annealing temperature @ 65 °C
The PCR product was analyzed on a 2 % agarose gel, run for 45 min @ 135 V
raPCR for the construction of anti miRsAg-shRNA sponges
In order to vary the length of the constructed sponges, three parameters were varied in the different PCRs:
a) the stop oligos were either added before or after the 12 cycle PCR
b) we used different amounts of binding site oligos (0.5, 1 or 1.5 ul each)
c) different amounts of 12 cycle PCR product were used in the second, 25 cycle PCR (either 1 or 20 ul)
the reaction was set up according to the standard miRACLE protocol; either 0.5, 1 or 1.5 ul of each binding site oligo were used. 0.5 ul were either added to the first and second PCR reaction or were not present in the first, but the second PCR. For analysis, 5 ul of each PCR product were loaded on a 1 % agarose gel, run @ 135 V for 45 min

digestion of the 200 bp, 400 bp and 700 bp band from the previous day (corresponding to hsa-mir-886-3p microRNA binding site patterns constructed via diraPCR

the diraPCR was pipetted according to the following protocol in three repeats:
1 ul of each binding site oligo
0.5 ul of each stop oligo
25 ul of Phusion MasterMix
add water to final volume of 50 ul
