Transfection

seeding HeLa and Huh7 in 96-well plates
24/10/2010
HeLa cells were transfected with miMeasure constructs with GFP expression regulated by different imperfect binding sites for miRsAg. As controls we used miMeasure construct with perfect binding site and no binding site. Each miMeasure was cotransfected  with pcDNA plasmid expressing synthetic miRsAg and pcDNA5 expressing synthetic shRNA3.
Transfection of HeLa and Huh7 cells with miMeasure with binding sites for miR122.
Huh7 were transfected with 50ng of miMeasure. HeLa cells were used as a control they were transfected with miMeasure constructs and miR122. Control without miR122 expression plasmid was made.

microscopy measurements
HeLa cells are transfected with the contructs which was randomly mutated and point muated. The cells were imaged under the confocal microscope with the 63x objective.
different binding sites for miRsAg
different binding sites for miR122, HeLa cotransfected with miR122 expression plasmid
Flow cytometry measurements
HeLa and HuH7 cells were seeded two days. One day before the cells were transfected and 100µl of cells are used for the flow cytometry, whereby 10000 cells are measured for each sample.
GFP/BFP ratio of single cells according to flow cytometry analysis
10/27/2010
HuH7 cells seeded and trasnfected one day before are imaged under the confocal microscope.
constructs:
perfect binding sites against miR-122
3 perfect binding sites aligned via miRaPCR
2 imperfect binding sites aligned via miRaPCR
HuH7 cells transfected with different binding sites are imaged with the confocal microscope; 63x; green = EGFP, blue = EBFP2
HeLa cells are also imaged under the confocal microscope and compared to the HuH7 cells in terms of EGFP/EGFP ratio normalized to the negative control.
comparison of HuH7 and HeLa cells": cells were transfected with the different constructs.
