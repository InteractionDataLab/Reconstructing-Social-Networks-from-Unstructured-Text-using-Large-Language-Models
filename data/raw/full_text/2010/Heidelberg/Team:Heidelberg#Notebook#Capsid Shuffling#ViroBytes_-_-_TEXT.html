ViroBytes
Virobytes is a rational approach to fragment-based DNA shuffling of Adeno-associated viral Cap genes. The method is complementary to our conventional homology based DNA shuffling . ViroByte strategy is based on BioByte protocol which have been modified in order to enable for randomized fragment assembly.
