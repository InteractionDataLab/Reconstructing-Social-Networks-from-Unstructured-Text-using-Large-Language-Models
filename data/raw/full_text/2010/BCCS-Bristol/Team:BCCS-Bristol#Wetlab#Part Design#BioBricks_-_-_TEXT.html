Team:BCCS-Bristol/Wetlab/Part Design/BioBricks/PyeaR+LacZ
The PyeaR promoter was ﬁrst put into the BioBrick standard by the University of Edinburgh’s 2009 iGEM team. We used this promoter and connected it to a GFP BioBrick to create a BioBrick that expresses GFP in response to levels of nitrite. We also connected the promoter to the LacZ gene which codes for β -galactosidase. This was used in a Miller assay, an experiment that is used to characterise a repressors response to inducer.
The constitutive RFP was expressed via an unmodiﬁed BioBrick from the parts registry.
