Testing the Biobrick - first tests
Having made our first biobrick, the next step was a series of basic experiments comparing its behaviour in an environment with nitrogen versus one without.
Two 5mL overnights were set up, one without any nitrogen and one with 20mM of Potassium Nitrate KNO3. This level was chosen as previous work by the Edinburgh 2009 iGEM team had shown the promoter strongly active by this point.  After growing the cultures overnight the solution with nitrate was visibly green whilst the one without was not, suggesting our new biobrick worked at least at the most basic ‘on/ off’ level.
