Biobricks Used in Preliminary Experiments
BBa_I13522 - pTet GFP
GFP under the control of a constitutive promoter. This was used to visualise E.coli on soil under a fluorescence microscope during the preliminary testing stage.
Vector used: pSB1A2. Ampicillin resistance used as selective marker.
BBa_K216009 - PyeaR with lacZ'
Nitrate- and nitrite-sensitive promoter upstream of lacZ' reporter. Used to characterize the promoter through a Miller assay.
Vector used: pSB1A2. Ampicillin resistance used as selective marker.
Biobricks to be used in the Project
BBa_K216005 - PyeaR promoter
Nitrate- and nitrite-sensitive promoter. This will be combined with BBa_E0840 or BBa_E0240 to create a nitrate-sensitive system which signals through expression of GFP.
Vector used: pSB1A2. Ampicillin resistance used as selective marker.
BBa_E0840 - GFP generator
GFP plus strong RBS and termination sequences.
Vector used: pSB1A2. Ampicillin resistance used as selective marker.
BBa_E0240 - GFP generator
GFP plus weaker RBS and termination sequences.
Vector used: pSB1A2. Ampicillin resistance used as selective marker.
BBa_J04450 - RFP coding device
RFP under the control of a constitutive promoter. This will be included in the E.coli chassis as a background fluorescence to aid in sensing and identifying the GFP signal, plus to act as a reference point for analysis of expression level of the GFP signal.
Vector used: pSB1K3. Kanamycin resistance used as selective marker.
BBa_I732017 - lacZ full-length (RBS+ TERM-)
Full length copy of lacZ which will be combined with PyeaR to further categorise the promoter used in our Nitrate sensor system.
