1 Design Choices
1.1 Promoter: PyeaR
1.2 Signal: GFP
1.3 Chassis: MG1655
Design Choices
Promoter: PyeaR
Proteins involved native in most 'E. coli' strains.
Doesn't depend on metabolic state of bacteria (i.e. doesn't require anaerobic environment).
Already available in parts registry.
Signal: GFP
Easily detectable with relatively low tech equipment.
Quantifiable signal.
Doesn't require any substrate (as opposed to luciferase).
Wide range of fluorescent proteins available in parts registry; allows us to easily extend project by connecting these to other promoters, without needing additional detection equipment.
Chassis: MG1655
Minimally engineered; meaning chassis robust enough to survive in the environment, without posing a public health hazard.
