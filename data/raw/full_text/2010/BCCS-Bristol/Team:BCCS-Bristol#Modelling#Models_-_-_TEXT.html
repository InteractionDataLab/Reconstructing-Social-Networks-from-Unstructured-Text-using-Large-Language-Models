E.coli sensing nitrogen
Movie of our simple GRN model implemented in BSim. The bacteria detect if the local nitrate concentration is above a certain threshold. If so, they begin producing GFP. If they stray outside high nitrate zones, GFP production stops. However, the GFP already within them does not break down- at least not noticeably on this timescale.
