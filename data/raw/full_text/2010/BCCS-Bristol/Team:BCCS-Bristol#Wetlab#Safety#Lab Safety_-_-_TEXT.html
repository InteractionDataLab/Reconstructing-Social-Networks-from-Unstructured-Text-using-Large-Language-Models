Lab Safety
The agriColi project involved the genetic manipulation and handling of a variety of strains of E.coli and as such falls under specific safety guidelines defined by the University of Bristol (UoB).
All students contributing to the laboratory work were registered with the UoB Biological and Genetic Modification Safety Committee, allowing them to work with the variety of biological and chemical agents involved in the agriColi project, under the supervision of Dr. Nigel Savery.
All laboratory work performed by registered students fell under the guidelines set out by the UoB Safety Committee and also local rules set out by the laboratories where the work was performed - specifically the DNA-Protein Interactions Unit in the School of Biochemistry (under the supervision of Dr. Nigel Savery) and the Root Development Lab in the School of Biological Sciences (under the supervision of Prof. Claire Grierson).
All students involved in the laboratory work were trained to an appropriate level of competence in the application of techniques and use of relevant equipment, and where necessary supervised whilst performing work in the laboratory.
All projects were approved and overseen by the iGEM supervisor Dr. Nigel Savery.
