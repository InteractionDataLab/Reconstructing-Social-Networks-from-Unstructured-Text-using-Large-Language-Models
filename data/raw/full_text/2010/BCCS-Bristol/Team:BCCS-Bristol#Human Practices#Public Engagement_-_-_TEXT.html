Public Engagement
Public engagement is an important part of our project. We wanted to tell people about what we have achieved and what our research is about.
School Visit
We visited Clevedon Community School to present our research to two Sixth-Form Biology classes. We were well received - explaining what iGEM is all about and the things we'd achieved in a summer.
We gave a presentation to each of the classes about iGEM, us and our project, and then did a practical demonstration where the students made their own beads (...without the E. coli).
See photos here!
Here are our slides for the presentation.
Radio Interviews
Various members of our team took part in two separate radio programmes, one on BBC Radio Bristol and the other on Bristol Community Radio .
