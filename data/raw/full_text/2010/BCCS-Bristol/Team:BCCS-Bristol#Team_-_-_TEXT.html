What We've Done
All of the work for this iGEM project was carried out by the memebers of the student team. The BSim 2010 software package has built on the 2009 version, which was submitted for the 2009 iGEM competition. All of the new code for environmental interactions and the graphical user interface was written by the 2010 student team members.
