Human Practices
Our main achievement in this area has been to present our research in a new and accessible way. By using the novel approach of developing a publicity campaign for a hypothetical product based on our project, we have been able to design a leaflet to engage the public in our research.
Our overall approach to human practices has two strands:
Publicity Campaign : by framing our work as a prototype product we hope to encourage public interest by making synthetic biology research tangible whilst providing balanced and scientific information.
Public Engagement : We have participated in radio interviews and school visit to help explain our work to the wider public.
