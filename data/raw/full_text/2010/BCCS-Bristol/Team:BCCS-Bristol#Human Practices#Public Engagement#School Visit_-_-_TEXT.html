School Visit
We gave a presentation to each of the classes about iGEM, us and our project, and then did a practical demonstration where the students made their own beads (...without the E. coli).

Distributing supplies after the presentation
Students pipetting liquid gellan mix into an ionic solution (salt water)
We tried to find the best technique to make a perfecty spherical bead
Testing for consistency
We asked the students what they would do if they were starting an iGEM project

Tom explaining what synthetic biology is all about
The students were interested in hearing where a degree in biology can take you
Student experiences problems as stock gellan solution cools and solidifies
Student showing some of the best beads
