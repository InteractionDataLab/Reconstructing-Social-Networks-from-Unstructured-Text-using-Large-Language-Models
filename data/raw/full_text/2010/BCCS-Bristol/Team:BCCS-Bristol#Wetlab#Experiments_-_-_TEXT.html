Experiments
Here you can find details of all the experiments we conducted, along with the resulting data gathered. In the spirit of scientific co-operation, we've aimed to present our work so that for each experiment, another scientist would be able to replicate it without any prior knowledge or extra information.
At some points pages may refer to 'standard' procedures. In most cases these are well known techniques, or procedures documented in kits (e.g. Quiagen miniprep kits), however just in case, we've also provided a database of all the standard procedures used.
