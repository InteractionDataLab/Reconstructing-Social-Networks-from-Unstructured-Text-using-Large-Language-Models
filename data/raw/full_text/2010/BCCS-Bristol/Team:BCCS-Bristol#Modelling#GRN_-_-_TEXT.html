GRN Model Overview
GRN Derivation
GRN Methodology
GRN Results
Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) models are a useful way of representing the reactions within bacterial cells. This section provides details of our mathematical model of the agrEcoli system, and how we derived it.
Once we had a mathematical model, we needed to simulate its workings using both numeric and analytical methods. This section describes the tools we used to simulate our system, and why we chose them.
Our GRN model was used to inform our lab work and BSim simulations. This section contains the results of our GRN modelling efforts, including time evolution graphs and phase plane diagrams.
