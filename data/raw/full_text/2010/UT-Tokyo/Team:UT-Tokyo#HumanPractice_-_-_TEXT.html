iGEM Japan
iGEM Kyoto suggested "Human Practice iGEM Japan" project to other iGEM teams in Japan. Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project. iGEM Kyoto leads the project, and successfully we have gotten over 1500 answers! According to the results, we revealed the difference of opinion between students and the others.We also found that Japanese have a positive impression about biotechnology, but in parallel they worry about the safety very much.
Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practice” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose "negative" or "neutral" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practice activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.

Questionnaire
We made 2 similar kinds of questionnaire. One is "Attitude survey of genetic engineering" and the other is  "Attitude survey of biotechnology." They are almost the same, but "Attitude survey of biotechnology" has a little different question from "Attitude survey of genetic engineering". We only changed the word "genetic engineering" of the survey for "biotechnology" in order to make "Attitude survey of biotechnology."
And we attempted to indicate difference of image between "genetic engineering" and "biotechnology".
Attitude survey of ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )
When shopping, do you buy "not genetically modified food”?
[ Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / I have never seen such an indication ]

[ Clone / GM crops (foods) / Patent / DNA / Genome / Medicine / Cosmetic / Bioethics / Virus / Artificial Life / Novel Prize / Environment / Biological weapon / iPS cells, ES cells / Biofuel / Biohazard / Others( ) ]
If there is no difference in effectiveness, what do you think about using the drugs manufactured by ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )?
[ Not mind I use / Hardly mind I use / If possible, I don't want to use / I must not use / I don't know ]
What do you think of the artificial genetic mutation by ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )?
[ Bad / Little bad / Little good / Good ]
Which trend of information about ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology ) is major, negative or positive?
[ Negative / About the same degree / Positive / No idea ]
Do you think Japan actively tackles on ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )?
[ Yes / Partly yes / Not so much / No ]

Others( )
If you answered [No], please encircle every reason from below.

Because products of it can be harmful to human body.
Because it is unethical.
Because people say it is dangerous.

Others( )
Have you ever heard the word, "Synthetic biology"?
[ Yes / No ]

Results
We drove this survey from July to September 26th.
All data: HumanPractice.xls
Our result is too much to write all on this page. So we write only graphs on this page and upload all result data. We analyzed mainly following points.
compare between arts and science(*) in college student
compare between "genetic engineering" and "biotechnology"
compare between people with different jobs
compare between college student and the others
(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.
