Parts
New for iGEM 2010 is the groupparts tag.  This tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
lox check assay
We introduce our measurement assay. The assay shown in the figure is to check cre expression. This construct cannot express gfp because of double terminators between lox site. When there is cre, lox cite is removed and gfp is expressed. This is one of the switches induced by cre.
