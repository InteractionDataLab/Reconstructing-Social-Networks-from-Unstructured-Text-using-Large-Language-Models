Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project. iGEM Kyoto leads the project, and successfully we have gotten over 1500 answers! According to the results, we revealed the difference of opinion between students and the others.We also found that Japanese have a positive impression about biotechnology, but in parallel they worry about the safety very much.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</SPAN></H3><P>This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practice” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Motivation">Motivation</SPAN></H4><P>According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; than the other nationalities <SUP><A href="#RefH001">[1]</A></SUP>. In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food <SUP><A href="#RefH002">[2]</A></SUP>. We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</SPAN></H4><OL><LI> By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
</LI><LI> We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practice activities.
</LI><LI> This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.

(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.
