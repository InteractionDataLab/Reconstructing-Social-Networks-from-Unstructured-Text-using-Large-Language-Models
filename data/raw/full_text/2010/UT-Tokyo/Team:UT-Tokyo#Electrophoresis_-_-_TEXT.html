Electrophoresis
Preparation
・Sample
・Gel （1% gel for fine separation, 2% for rough separation, use 2 % gel for colony PCR)
・DNA loading dye
・DNA λH200 ladder mix
Procedure
1. Add 1 ul dye for 10 ul sample, and apply to the well.
2. Apply 2 ul ladder to the edge well, electrophoresis for 30 minutes.
! DNA chain fewer than 100 bp has danger of over flowing.If you do electrophoresis for 27 minutes, chain of 129 bp will narrowly stay in the gel.
3. Dye with EtBr for about 20 minutes.
4. Observe by UV.
Use “Fujifilm” to cut out. This one needs time to boot-up, so turn on the switch first.
