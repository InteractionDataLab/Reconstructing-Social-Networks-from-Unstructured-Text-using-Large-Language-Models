Restriction Enzyme digestion（Xba1/Pst1）—Once for all
Preparation
plasmid
10× buffer (H and M in the freezer)
enzymeI,enzymeII（in the freezer in the next room）
MilliQ
1.5ml tube
■the correspondence of buffers
EX・・・M ES・・・H XP・・・M SP・・・H
Procedure
■attention
use 1.5ml tube
enzyme must always be on ice! / Don’t leave at room temperature and heat!
put back in the freezer immediately!
thaw frozen buffer fully! / you should spin down and vortex
change MilliQ into new one everyday
※add MilliQ first and enzyme last / mix before add enzyme
for extracting gel
begin with 0.5μl enzyme and add to it if you worry (0.5μl is enough)
1. add ?μl plasmid（30μl for 1000ng）
3μl 10× buffer
0.5μl enzymeI
0.5μl enzymeII
MilliQ up to 30μl
2. incubate at 37 degrees for over 1hour
(for 3 or 4 hour makes it sure)
for cut check
1. add 1μl plasmid (regardless of the concentration)
2μl 10× buffer
0.5μl enzymeI
0.5μl enzymeII
MilliQ up to 20μl
2. incubate at 37 degrees for over 1hour
(for 3 or 4 hour makes it sure)
