Gel DNA Recovery
Preparation
・Kit of promega
・MilliQ
・Gel
・Make sure that tank for electrophoresis and EtBr are not polluted.
Procedure
1. Cut out gel with wanted band and put it in a tube.
2. Add 3 parts Mem. binding sol. to 1 part Gel volume.
3. Shake & Incubate at 57 degrees C until gel melts.
4. Put in the column.
5. Centrifuge for 1 min at the largest spin number (at room temperature)
6. Empty collection tube and add 700 ul Mem. Wash sol, centrifuge for 1 minute.
7. Empty collection tube and add 500 ul Mem. Wash sol, centrifuge for 1 minute.
8. Change the column to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf and centrifuge for 1 minute.
9. Change the old tube to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf, add 30ul MilliQ, leave for 1 minutes, then centrifuge for 1 minutes.
