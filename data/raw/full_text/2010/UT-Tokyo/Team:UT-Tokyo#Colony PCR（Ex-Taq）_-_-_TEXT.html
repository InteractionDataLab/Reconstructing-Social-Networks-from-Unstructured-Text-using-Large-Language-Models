Colony PCR(Ex-Taq)
Preparation
・5′primer
・3′primer
・2.5mMdNTP
・10x standard buffer
・MilliQ
・DNA template
・Ex-Taq
Procedure
1. Number colonies.
2. Add 5 uL MilliQ to 0.2 mL tube.
3. Tap a part of colony by tip and put into numberd tube.
4. Put into thermal cycler at 95 degrees C for 5 minutes.
5. While waiting, put the following into 1.5 ml tubes. Prepare tubes one more than the sample sample number for insurance.
0.1μl 100uM 5′primer
0.1μl 100uM 3′primer
0.8μl 2.5mMdNTP
1μl 10x standard buffer
2.92μl MilliQ
Voltex the tube and mix well.
0.08μl Ex-Taq (0.05ul for Takara)
Snap the tube and mix well
6. Add 5ul into new tube and set for PCR
1. 95 degress for 2 minutes
2. 95 degrees for 30 seconds
3. 52-55 degrees for 30 seconds ( depends on the melting temeprature of DNA)
4. 72.5 degrees for 1minutes ×（ ）kb（length of DNA）＋ as long as you are at ease
5. 95 degrees for 30 seconds
6. repeat 1-5 for 29 times
7. 25 degrees for forever (depends on the melting temperature of DNA)
