Information
AP1 binding site
AP1 binding site is promoter site where Activation Protein 1 binds to regulate gene expression.
The known sequence referenced from Wikipedia is TGAGTCA. This site is known as an essential part
for regulation of COL1A2 promoter activity by transforming growth factor 2.  Due to property of AP1, only expressed naturally in human, interacts directly with DNA in nucleus,
and well known promoter sequence, our team decided to use it as core regulator in DiscoverY project.
Regardless of orginal biological function of AP1 and its binding site, this region is now used to activate its own promoter, which is linked to GFP gene. When AP1 is expressed and activated, this protein initiates gene expression
and linked gene, GFP in our case, is expressed with fluorescent signal which means detection of and antigen.
Malaria
To eradicate malaria, humanity has been making its vaccine to inactivate malaria parasite.
But, it is failed because it is very ineffective although it is possible theoretically.
Todays research, they find antigen which make antibody attached parasite membrane or surface protein.
Aerobic bacteria
Some bacteria react the magnetic field. These bacteria, in magnetic field, stand in a line.
Not only these but also many animals have some mechanisms which recognize magnetic area.
In addition, aerobic or anaerobic microbes line when they are stimulted by oxygen.
DDS system using HNMT
Drug Delivery System(DDS) using virus has tissue specificity. For example, Coronavirus usually infect Upper respiratory tracts.
HNMT(histamine N-methylatransferase) is a enzyme used in metabolic of histamine and inactivate histamine to deliver methyl.
There are two kinds of enzyme, one is DAO, the other is HNMT.
Because DAO has a copper on its sturucture, so it is hard to sythesize it.
Fortunately, HNMT is a single strand protein which is composed just 290 anmino acid.

KEY WORDS: genetic polymorphisms, thiol methyltransferase, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, thioether methyltransferase, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
This paper is for genetic polymorphisms related of methylation.
It treats various mythytrasferase mechanisms including HNMT
The Result of BLAST
I put the sequences of Dong Chan in BioBrick DB.
There is no corresponding brick as we expected.
It can be good news but on the other hand, we should search spike protein sequences.
There were some partial analogous sequences, but those are not related to our sequences in function.
I’ll post the result of BLAST parsing for feedback
E.Coli OMV
Maybe we could use hemolysin which Stanford team used.
The technology transporting antigen for vaccine using Bacterial Outer Membrane Vescicle(OMV) is published in the February
issue of PNAS. See the attached file.
P.S. There is a similar thesis in J. Mol. Biol. It shows the functional improvement of OMV.
It also is attached.
We may be able to use vesicle in E.coli.
STAT1 & JAK1

STAT's Promoter
STAT1 homodimers are involved in type II interferon signalling, and binds to the GAS (Interferon-Gamma Activated Sequence) promoter to induce expression of ISG (Interferon Stimulated Genes).  In type I interferon signaling, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer combines with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which binds to the ISRE (Interferon Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce ISG expression.
