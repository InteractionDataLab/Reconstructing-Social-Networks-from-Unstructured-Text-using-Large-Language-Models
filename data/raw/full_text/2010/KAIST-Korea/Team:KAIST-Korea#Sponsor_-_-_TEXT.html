Without the generous support of the following corporation, we would have had a much harder time getting anything done.
Bioneer
Corporation History
  Bioneer Corporation is the first Korean biotechnology company established in 1992. The company has developed state of art molecular biology products and technologies including oligonucleotides, thermostable polymerases, and instruments of gene manipulation (automatic nucleic acid extractor, thermal cycler, real-time QPCR instruments and DNA sequencer). From its inception, Bioneer has invested in the integration of recombinant DNA technology, fermentation, biochemistry and nucleic acid chemistry in addition to mechanics, photonics and electronics. The company is positioned to fully-integrate its capability to develop next generation technologies in the post-genome era through the invention of new biochemistry and instruments. Bioneer now runs two production and research facilities in Korea which are a total of 226,000 square feet. Equipped with proprietary 384 synthesizers, these facilities contain a full production line for oligonucleotide and siRNA synthesis. In addition to DNA manufacturing, Bioneer processes recombinant proteins which are fermented and purified on proprietary purification systems.
  After a successful Initial Public Offering in December 2005, Bioneer Corp. launched Bioneer Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary. The American subsidiary is located in a 22,000 square foot production and distribution facility in Alameda, CA, the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is dedicated to providing state of art solutions to the global community of life science researchers in academia, biotech and pharmaceutical companies.
