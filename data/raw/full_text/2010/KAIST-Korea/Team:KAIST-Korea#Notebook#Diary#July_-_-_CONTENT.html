So we decided the memo to be literally the memo for our project. And we prof-read our introduction, motivation, memo, dairy together.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_2"> July 2 </SPAN></H2><P>We faced new problem. Our main sponsor Bioneer president has no time because of business trip, we have no way to do the experiment for 10 days. So we discussed what to do during these 10 days. Since we have many advisors we need economical support. Therefore we decided to meet our department president for our economical support. And We will ask what we have to buy to KIB assistant for experiment. Finally we will ask Bioneer to give us a gene that we need right away, instead of doing it 10 days later.
</P><P>Do list
</P><OL><LI> Idea
</LI><LI> what Bioneer use. (vector)
</LI><LI> contacting professor Dong Sup for economical support.
</LI><LI> Bioneer contact
</LI><LI> experiment materials preparement. 
</LI><LI> Designing wiki.
</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_5"> July 5 </SPAN></H2><P>It seems that gene synthesis will be slow when we look at bioneer information. Therefore we decided to buy JAK1 and STAT1 and do our experiment first. And since JAK1 is only sold outside of country we will test on JAK3 which has similar pathway instead. In case of fusion antibody, we think it would be slower for us to do the experiment we decided to let this task left for bioneer. And we will ask for advice how to do vector design. And we finished our diary design.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_6"> July 6 </SPAN></H2><P>We asked for advice how to do vector design. So we give gene sequence and following restriction enzyme information to our advisor. So we got precious tips. And we estimated our budgets for our experiment.  
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_7"> July 7 </SPAN></H2><OL><LI> Contacting Bioneer(for buying primer)
</LI><LI> Buying genes from KRIBB and getting receipt. 
</LI><LI> Contacting Prof. Jung-Kyoon Choi for buying experimental equipments.
</LI><LI> Buying JAK1 Gene, Antigen, Antibody.
</LI><LI> Organize our budgets.
</LI><LI> Contacting Prof. Seung-Uk Ryu for setting experimental equipments.
</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_10"> July 10 </SPAN></H2><P>We changed our template to be yeast from e.coli. As a consiquence, we use IL-6 alpha receptor and changed into JAK1, gp130, LMO4, STAT3 included pathway. Also we researched on these gene sequence and give a modification to the introduction page.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_12"> July 12 </SPAN></H2><P>We meet president of Bioneer for project advice. And we decided to change our target as tuberculosis. 
</P><P>Do list
</P><OL><LI> Checking pathway (newly found that we have to put npKC-delta)
</LI><LI> We discussed that we should change the menu because now we know how to get rid of main frame.
</LI><LI> Giving a name for our project
</LI><LI> finding new antibody sequence

</LI><LI> design
</LI><LI> motivation 
</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_14"> July 14 </SPAN></H2><P>We went to Bioneer to get advice on how to use yeast and design experiment. And they give us a information that we have to use homologous recombinant and it will take about 3 month. Therefore, we discussed what to do.
</P><OL><LI> taking the risk of stability and put plasmid inside yeast.
</LI><LI> we attend iGEM next year. 
</LI></OL><P>Finally we decided to conclude this problem when we have a final schedule for experiment.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_15"> July 15 </SPAN></H2><P>What we found in the past was a receptor that has Ig like part. But that part was not activation part but just a existing structure. Therefore we look for receptor that has Ig like part and this part act as activation site. We found FGFR as our solution. So we decided to look for more information on FGFR.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_17_18"> July 17 18 </SPAN></H2><P>We searched for more information on FGFR. And we rewrited our new introduction.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_19"> July 19 </SPAN></H2><P>We went to Bioneer. We strongly felt that we need very deep understanding of AP1 pathway. And other then receptors in human, we need to find receptor and signal pathway in yeast so that we can easily use it on our project. Also, Bioneer people said that AP1 is used in yeast. Therefore we decided to find this information to see if we can use it on our AP1 pathway.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_20"> July 20 </SPAN></H2><P>We found new pathway that FGFR use STAT1 directly. Once FGFR get signal, STAT1 forms dimer which lead to gene expression. Following this idea we made new introduction and flash.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_21"> July 21 </SPAN></H2><P>We put safety on wiki, update diary and main flash.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_22"> July 22 </SPAN></H2><OL><LI> We improved our main page design
</LI><LI> We will make a improvement on Subpage design which are BioBrick, Safety, Main Flash, Photos
</LI><LI> We added some contents on method
</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_26"> July 26 </SPAN></H2><P>We are finishing what we didn't finish on 22th. And Bioneer said that it will take almost one and a half month for synthetic our gene sequence for our experiment. Therefore, meanwhile, we decided to do poster, human practice, presentation. So we divide teams for each one.
poster - SB, SJ, HW
H.P. - ES, SH, HJ, DC
Persentation - JH, NB, GG, JB
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_27"> July 27 </SPAN></H2><P>Today we are going to do what we did yesterday continuously. 
Feedback
</P><OL><LI> modeling team need to compare antibody-antigen affinity for other antibodies.
</LI><LI> ultimately we are going to change binding site of antibody. Therefore we might need to check antibody sequence also.
</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_29"> July 29 </SPAN></H2><P>Today we checked our current status and did what we were doing.
current status
</P><OL><LI> Biobrick team : contents of biobrick are almost finished. Therefore they are doing design for wiki. We did feed back on this team to put more contents on each biobrick
</LI><LI> Modeling team : they found 10 antibody sequences and we checked how much it is alike from our FGFR1 structure.
</LI><LI> Presentation team : they are making movies for introduction. they found songs that they will put on those movies and going to find pictures for movies
