Idea
Bacteria calculator
If bacteria can make NAND GATE, it also can make OR, AND, NOT, XOR, NXOR GATE.
To use these, we can make bacteria calculator
Dumy DB
BioBricks DUMY is completed.
'dbupdater' which makes 'txt file' for DB import using parsing 'fasta file' from DB updater.
For now, it is drived with SQLite3 engine, and is intalled at SPARCS surver.
It has 4 kinds of search condition, parts id, parts type, short description, and sequence.
We suppose to include query function to developing BioBrick pythos module.
Alcanivorax Borkumensis
Alcanivorax Borkumensis is the bacteria that releases enzyme that can decompose oil.
And we can design like insulin producing system to solve oil spilling problems in ocean problem.
There already exists this system.
Virus targets specific cells
They generally have one host. With this idea we can make drug delivery system. We can use receptor of coronavirus to target. Since we commonly catch a cold but we don't get seriously hurt, we could use this system on DDS. problem It has to be tested to be proved to be a drug.
Cyanobacteria photosynthesis
There are common system call photosynthesis. We can use this idea to make new bacteria to imitate this system. And make this as a paint or we can extract only the chloroplast part alone or using cyanobacteria to make some kind of battery. We can use cyanobacteria because it literally do photosynthesis. And in case of stromatolite we can use it as building structure. problem We have to make e.coli to be as big as chloroplast. And we have to make it to be paint. There is problem when there is no sun or in bad wether. When it rains it could mess up sewage system.
NAND gate with E.coli
We can use 0/1 logic with some kind of chemicals as input and output. And we can make middle phase chemical not to mixed up with input and output chemical. We are thinking of lactose tryptophan as input. Since Stanford has basic skills on this we can use this. If we make this, we can make a flip flop which is basic component of memory system. problem If we use chemical as input and output we have to control chemical level. We have to make a system threshold to differentiate 0 or 1.
Yeastgrapher
This idea is making a photographer with yeast. We are making a photographer with RGB cone cell and fluorescence. There are already exists a study about cone cell receptors. We are thinking that we make RGB ratio as 40:20:1 like human retina. Film would be yeast. Therefore it can grow infinitely. problem film is not copiable. We have to be careful not to get light on film after taking a picture. It is not a matter of sensing but processing the images on brain. Therefore we are not sure that it would work.
Copyteria
We make a system as a copier. We put dye or degrader in e.coli. it would be important to design threshold. We have to make bacteria to be alive during the coping process and loose its color after the coping process. So we are making bacteria ink. problem We don't know the threshold for the light to be copied. And we might have to do this in dark room. Since the idea is getting the image from the reflected image we don't know how this reflected image would be copied.
Oscillator
There are memory network that remembers. And with that we can combine this with telomere. We can later use this protocol.
Sound
Using vibration maybe we can make bacteria make sound.
RBC trap virus
RBC can trap virus because virus can't replicate in RBC. But this system need to use fake cell only to delay. And only has probability to trap. Therefore it is not perfect system. Maybe Since it is making delay, we can use it at rabies because its infection timing is faster than recovering timing.
Mammalian cell replication tool
There are many steps in mammalian cell replication if we make a mammalian cell replicatable in vitro, it would be very convenient in laboratory life. Maybe we can work on mammalian cell replication tool or DDS that works on respiratory system. So we decided to look for that information.
