Dongchan Yang
  Hallo! I'm third grade undergraduate student of KAIST. I'm double majoring in BBE(Bio and Brain Engineering) and BS(Biological Science). I'm also interested in the CS(computer science). I'm interested in the Virology and Bioinformatics. More speciually, my interest is coronavirus. Generally, coronavirus just cause mild cold for human. But it caused severe pandemic(SARS) in 2002. I want to prevent spreading of novel pandemic to understand the mechanism how coronavirus could cause severe pandemic. My works in this team are to suggest biological pathway based on my BS background, to analyze bioinformation from many bioinformatics database, and to design novel protein and its peptide sequence and nucleotide sequence.
Eun Soo Kim
  Hello~! My name is Eun-Soo Kim, and I'm 20-year-old junior of KAIST, Korea. My major is 'Bio and Brain Engineering'. At KAIST, I'm learning various studies including 'Bioinformatics', 'Systems biotechnology', and 'Bio-signal processing'. Especially, because I want to study about fusion biotechnology, I'm really interested in synthetic biology. So, to participate this 'iGEM' competition is not only a really good chance but also very meaningful for my future. This experience will be very helpful for my growth, and I hope that I will grow up through this experience. I'm not afraid because I have friends who have same dreams of mine. I believe that our team will do a really good job, and I'll do my best to see our team's works get results.
  See you at Jamboree~!! :)
Soo Hwan Kim
  Hello~ My name is Soo-hwan Kim. I'm a undergraduate student of KAIST. My major is Bio and Brain Engineering. In my major class "System Biotechnology", I learned about synthetic biology, and I heard about iGEM competition. Because synthetic biology is very interesting for me, I am also interested in iGEM competition. These days not only I but also our team research into our project very hard. Through this competition, I want to find my aptitude and passion, and finally, i want to do something that makes a difference.
Best foot forward!!
Seung Bum Yang
  Hi, I'm SeungBum Yang. I'm a junior in KAIST, korea and majoring in Bio and Brain Engineering. I had a chance to know that there is a competition in synthetic biology area. Fortunately, I meet several friends who were interested in this competition and we became to attend this competition. Through this competition, I hope that I could get a sense to organize projects and do experiment professionally. I will be strongly involved in iGEM competition to make my self better and for our project. I hope everyone participate in iGEM get result they predicted and have fun in this competition. See you at Jamboree.
Hwan Jun Yun
Hello! Welcome to visit in our website! Good to see you in this competition!
My name is Yun, Hwan-Jun, third grade in KAIST. I was very inspired at Systems and Biotechnology lectured by Prof. Choi. Particularly, I was really interested in Synthetic Biology and Systems Biology. In our class, he talked about this competition, and we took an interested in that. Now, we are gathering everyday and do it really hard.
I will do my best in this project.
Then... I wish to meet you at Jamboree at November!
Nam Bin Yim
  Hello! I'm a junior student of Bio and Brain Engineering in KAIST. Actually, I really like to research about Brain Mapping. But through this iGEM competition, I become to be interested in synthetic biology also. I believe that synthetic biology can make our world beautiful. Futhermore, I believe that our project can make beautiful also!
  My part is that administrate and manage the whole things about this team and project. On the other words, a leader. I always encourage and practice all the members do the best. I'm happy that team members followed the order well.
  Although we are undergraduate students, we have a lot of potential energy to change our earth better. Through iGEM competition, we will show you that it is not lie. You can't miss it, our excellent project! See you at Jamboree with good result. :)
Jae Bong Jung
  I am a undergraduate student of Bio and Brain Engineering at KAIST. Before joining the 2010 iGEM team KAIST-Korea, I learned the synthetic biology in the class of System Biotechnology. Then I was fascinated by the synthetic biology. I will try to work iGEM project enthusiastically. Through the 2010 iGEM competition, I am looking forward to an exciting. And I will have a good time with teammates, during iGEM competition.
Han Sol Kim
  Hello, My name is Hansol Kim. I am 19 years old and a third-year undergraduate in KAIST. I'm majoring in Bio and Brain Engineering. System Biotechnology class held last spring semester impressed me and I think that the iGEM competition will be the great chance for adding my interest in synthetic biology. Through this competition, I am learning various knowledge and having a brand-new experiences. Though there are a lot of difficulties to be overcome yet, I hope that we will have a good result. And I also hope that everyone participating iGEM competition have a great time.
Jeong Hyun Lee
Hello, I'm doing great in Boston. [Past] I came back to rejoin the team. I have been absent in last two months because I had a job in Boston.  I am also a junior in BBE like most of our members.-Actually turning into a senior if you count it in American system. I joined BBE department because everything about medical development interests me, and synthetic biology also gave me a good impression. I hope this opportunity will not only change me but also make a difference in the world just as our motivation of DiscoverY stands. TTYL
