Make spike and HNMT plasmid and transform bacteria with them. Bacteria expressing them will produce HNMT and engulf via membrane fusion. Ultimately, use the bacteria in a spray.
What we should do (June 1st~August 31th)
Syenthesis of bacteria
Company: S.B. Yang>contact, rest>look for companies. Contact T.A.
Sequence source: D.C. Yang, K.K. Kim
1),2): by June 1st
KI building (Prof. Choi)
Homepage design
K.K. Kim, +alpha
SPARCS
I.D. department
2),3): cost a lot - about \1million. stick with 1)
S.B. Yang, K.K. Kim, D.C. Yang, H.S. Kim handle program until June 6th. The rest (design team) design.

Confirmation of the product
Florescent material such as GFP
Quantum dot

1st solid idea: respiratory system using spike protein & HNMT
We have to make two plasmid, which would be a guide plasmid and a functional plasmid. We put spike gene in the guide plasmid and HNMT in the functional plasmid. Then, bacteria will get spikes on the outer membrane and HNMT inside the cell. After that, if we can pack HNMT in the vesicle, we can make a DDS. And we can check if HNMT works by using quantum dot or GFP.
Do list
