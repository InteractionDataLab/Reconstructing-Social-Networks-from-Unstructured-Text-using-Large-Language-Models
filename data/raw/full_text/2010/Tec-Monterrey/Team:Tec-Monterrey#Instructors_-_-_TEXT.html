Dr. Mario Moisés Álvarez
Mario Moisés Álvarez is the former director of the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in México. He is the coordinator of the Biotechnology Graduate Program in this same institution, and one of the youngest scientists in México ranked as a Level 2 Researcher by the Mexican System of Researchers (SNI). Dr. Álvarez has a Ph.D. from Rutgers University in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, a Masters in Science in Chemical Engineering from Rutgers University, and a Masters in Science in Process Engineering and a Bachelor Degree in Biochemistry from the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He did a Postdoctoral stay at Bristol Myers Squibb, at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute, where he collaborated in different projects related to the design and scale-up of Pharmaceutical Processes, particularly reactive and crystallization processes.
Dr. Álvarez's main area of scientific expertise is laminar mixing (mixing operations at low speed or in high viscosity conditions). Currently, his group is working in the application of mixing knowledge on the design of bioreactors. This includes the design of novel high performance bioreactor systems for animal cell culture, the diagnose of mixing performance in bioreactors through reactive methods, and the study of non-ideal mixing conditions in bioreactive systems.
M. Sc. Sergio Ángel García Echauri
Sergio Ángel García Echauri is a researcher in the FEMSA Biotechnology Center at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in México, where he is currently working in his Ph.D. His early formation was in the Autonomous University of Baja California, where he obtained his title as a Biologist. He then carried out a thesis on the Isolation and Identification of Psychrophillic Organisms from the Antarctica and Expression of a Superoxide Dismutase from Deschampsia antarctica in Escherichia coli.
During the influenza outbreak in 2009, Sergio was part of the team that developed a novel technique for its detection and the creation of a recombinant vaccine against the A/H1N1. He was then invited to the Novartis Fourth Annual Global BioCamp, an event for the biotechnology leaders from the best universities in 27 countries, held at Cambridge, Massachusets in October 2009.
Dr. Manuel I. Zertuche Guerra
Dr. Manuel Zertuche Guerra has a Masters Degree in Science with a specialization in Production Systems and a Ph.D. in Plant Physiology from Texas A&M.  In 1992, he was named the Head of the International Center for Agribusinesses and then became the Director of the Center of Strategic Studies in the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He developed strategic planning projects in Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. He works as a consultant and has participated in several conferences and seminars in the United States and Canada. He is currently the Head of the Biotechnology and Food Division in the Tecnológico de Monterrey and leads several research projects in collaboration with important Mexican corporations, such as FEMSA, CEMEX, LALA, Tyson, and Landsteiner Scientific.
M. Sc. José Manuel Aguilar Yáñez
José Manuel Aguilar majored in Biology with a specialty in Molecular Biology at the Baja California Autonomous University. In 2007, he got a M.S. Degree in Biotechnology at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, where he was awarded an Honorary Mention for Excellence and an Outstanding Thesis Mention. He has two scientific publications and two more under revision, as well as five national patent requests and one Patent Cooperation Treaty. As of now, he works at the Tecnológico de Monterrey as a professor and is on his way to finish his Ph.D.
M. Sc. Johari Salgado Gallegos
Johari Salgado is a biologist graduated from the Baja California Autonomous University. In 2007, he received an M.S. Degree in Biotechnology at the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He participated in the development of an Influenza vaccine during the  A/H1N1 2009 outbreak and currently leads several projects in collaboration with Landsteiner Scientific, in addition to teaching the Genetic Engineering Laboratory in the Tecnológico de Monterrey.
Felipe López Pacheco
Felipe López Pacheco has a technical degree in Biotechnology and is currently majoring in Biotechnology Engineering. As part of a joint project between the Landsteiner Pharmaceutical Group and ITESM, he is in charge of performing ELISAS to find antibodies.
