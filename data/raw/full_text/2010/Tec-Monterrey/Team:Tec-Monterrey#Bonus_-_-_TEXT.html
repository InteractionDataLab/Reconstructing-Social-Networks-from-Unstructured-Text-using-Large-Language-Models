Special Thanks
A more relaxed section to place our photos and the information on our beloved mascot: Wiki Wiki. Here you’ll get how we got along, what we did when we were together and how we became increasingly random as the time passed.
Gallery : photos from the lab and elsewhere.
Wiki Wiki : everything you need to know about Wiki Wiki, our peacock.
