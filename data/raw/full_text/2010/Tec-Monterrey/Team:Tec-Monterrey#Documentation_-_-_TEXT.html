Special Thanks
This is the section in which we registered all we did during the summer: our laboratory journal, the protocols we followed, our considerations on safety & ethics and our contribution to human practices, which was one of our major objectives after encountering some setbacks in the development of our project. Hopefully, the information contained in this section will prove to be very useful for upcoming iGEM teams.
Journal : All our lab activities, the experiments we carried out to get to our results.
Protocols : The rules we follow when experimenting.
Safety & Ethics : The team considerations on safety and ethics concerning biological research.
Human Practices : Our contribution for the improvement of research conditions in our country.
