He investigated theoretical information for the project, performed general laboratory work and collaborated on the design of the synthesis. He was committed to finish the final construct and spent endless nights running gel electrophoreses. 
</P><H4>Pamela Campos</H4><P class="blah">
She was in charge of managing and cleaning the material at the laboratory and also helped with general lab work. She contributed by writing the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Tec-Monterrey/Humanpractices">Importation Manual</A> and by going to the Health Department to request information about the permits necessary to import our DNA synthesis.
</P><H4>Cristóbal Cevallos</H4><P class="blah">
He contacted possible sponsors, organized a fundraising party and was in charge of the trip logistics to Boston. He worked on general laboratory work, mainly in the characterizations of pBAD, MuC and MuMor.

</P><H4>Jan Contreras</H4><P class="blah">
He performed general laboratory work, focusing in the design of the final construct and the MuMor sensitivity tuner. He did the mathematical modelling and characterization of pBAD, MuC and MuMor sensitivity tuners and participated in the registration of the BioBricks.

</P><H4>Héctor Gálvez</H4><P class="blah">
He took the leadership of the group and helped organize the work to be done by assigning specific jobs and responsibilities to every team member. He contributed to the logistics of the project and made a calendar with goal dates. He wrote the project summary and he organized most of the information and documentation for the wiki. During the summer he helped with general wet lab work and contacted several government offices for sponsorships.

</P><H4>Andrés Huerta</H4><P class="blah">
He was in charge of the design and codification of the team wiki, the T-shirts and the poster. He collaborated with general laboratory work and helped in the DNA importation process.

</P><H4>Tatiana Núñez</H4><P class="blah">
She was in charge of the administration of chemical reactants, general laboratory work, and customs information regarding the DNA importation. She registered and submitted the BioBricks.

</P><H4>Diana Ostos</H4><P class="blah">
Diana contributed with the internal logistics of the project and ordered and paid the DNA synthesis. She also collaborated with the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Tec-Monterrey/Humanpractices">Importation Manual</A> and helped with general laboratory work. She worked on the development of the MuC sensitivity tuner and the design of the final construct.

</P><H4>Javier Reynoso</H4><P class="blah">
During the summer, Javi's main task was to find sponsors for the project, which he achieved quite successfully. He also helped with general laboratory work, but left early for his exchange program in Australia. From there, he still kept tabs with our sponsors. 

</P><H4>Flavio Siller</H4><P class="blah">
He performed mostly general wet lab work. He designed a program to quickly calculate the amount of enzymes needed for  digestions and ligation reactions. He also helped with the writing of several parts of the wiki. 

</P><H2>Instructors</H2><H4>Dr. Mario Álvarez</H4><P class="blah">
He was the first one to believe in us and suggested ideas for different applications for the sensor. He donated some material from his own projects and will be accompanying us to the Jamboree. 

</P><H4>M. Sc. Sergio García</H4><P class="blah">
Sergio taught us hands-on most of the protocols and procedures we needed in the laboratory - from pipetting correctly to preparing electrocompetent cells. He always had a creative explanation for our troubleshooting and encouraged us to think out of the box. Sergio always supported us with lab material and was incredibly patient with us.
</P><H2>Advisors</H2><H4>Dr. Manuel Zertuche</H4><P class="blah">
Dr. Zertuche, on behalf of the Biotechnology and Food Division of the Tecnológico de Monterrey, was the main sponsor of the project and helped us with the planning and the timeline in order to achieve our short and long term goals. He provided us with the facilities and gave us his approval for almost everything we asked for. We really appreciate his  advice and support, and thank him for believing in us.

</P><H4>M. Sc. José Manuel Aguilar</H4><P class="blah">
He helped us with the theoretical information and developed with us the idea of the intelligent biosensor. He also advised us on troubleshooting. 

</P><H4>M. Sc. Johari Salgado</H4><P class="blah">
Johari selflessly shared his laboratory with us and was always willing to help us get material and equipment.

</P><H4>Felipe López</H4><P class="blah">
He instructed us on how to use the microplate reader for the characterization of our parts.
</P><H2>Collaboration with other iGEM Teams</H2><P class="blah">
We contributed with other universities by participating on their surveys; unfortunately we weren’t able to answer all of them, but we tried to have an active contribution.</P><H4>Mexico-UNAM-CINVESTAV and UNAM-Genomics_Mexico</H4><P class="blah">
We contacted and befriended the other two Mexican teams (Mexico-UNAM-CINVESTAV and UNAM-Genomics_Mexico) in order to start an open collaboration in our country and encourage the development of synthetic biology. We exchanged points of view regarding the problems we had with Customs and their advice was taken into account when writing the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Tec-Monterrey/Humanpractices">Importation Manual</A>. </P><H4>British Columbia (2009)</H4><P class="blah">
We used some of the BioBricks submitted by the 2009 British Columbia team (pBAD, pBAD weak, pBAD strong), proved their correct function and re-characterized their <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13453">pBAD BioBrick.</A></P><H4>TU Delft</H4><P class="blah">
We would finally like to thank the TU Delft team, as we used part of their code on our wiki.
