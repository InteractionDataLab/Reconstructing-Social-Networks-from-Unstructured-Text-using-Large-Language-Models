Special Thanks
For our project, we submitted ten BioBricks to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Most of these parts are related to the two families of PoPS amplifiers that we developed and characterized for our project. Two parts are genetic devices that were used to characterize the PoPS amplifiers. We also submitted our final construction that is the genetic device that powers our “intelligent biosensor”.
