The Tec-Monterrey iGEM team is made up of ten 7th semester Biotechnology Engineering students from the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. Most members come from different parts of the country, and everyone's unique personality helped shape an extraordinarily hardworking and fun team.
José Alberto Argüelles Piña “The Boxer”
This quiet student from Chihuahua, Chihuahua was in charge of coordinating the final construct of the project. He specializes in the area of bioprocesses and is extremely meticulous in everything he does.
Likes: thoroughly thinking over every decision, mumbling to himself, boxing
Dislikes: public speaking
Pamela Campos Flores “The Mommy”
This little package of wonder from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon specializes in bioprocesses. She is currently in an exchange program in North Dakota, but will be able to join in us in Boston for the Jamboree. Her constant motivation kept the whole team smiling throughout the summer and the lab impeccable.
Likes: taking care of everybody, giving advice, fretting
Dislikes: crossing the street
Julio Cristóbal Cevallos Escobar “The President”
