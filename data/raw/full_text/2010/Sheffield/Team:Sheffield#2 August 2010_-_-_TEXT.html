Team:Sheffield/2 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 2nd August - back in city view cafe
Again the attempts of transforming the BarA mutant have been unsuccessful. We decided the cells made by Tom and Caz failed to be competent, so steve, Matt and Caz made some more compotent cells in the afternoon. Nii and Narmada continued their work at modelling transcription and translation for our experiments. Tom developed an image of Catherine, who is now our super adviser with the power of controlling water and also tried to get the wiki online, with unfortunate results. Back to the drawing board.
The evening plan - team bowling at Hollywood Bowl! Team Andy, Nii, Tom and Phil were the first winners, then Steve, Caz, Narmada and Matt won the second game. Following bowling, the team headed into town for a few quiet ones and a few games of pool. Evidently we're a team with much stamina - the doormen had to make us leave, as  the bars were shutting.
