Team:Sheffield/5 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 5th August - Just a spoonfull of Sugar...
12pm start to allow the wine to wear off. Some arrived at this rather generous time, some didn't (Tom 'lazy' Leach & Matt 'flagging' Ford). The plan for the day was to continue with designing primers to order, editing the wiki and modelling. The day was interspaced by an instruction to help clean the lab, so the team got their blue gloves on armed with plenty of ethanol to wipe down the benches. Who knew cleaning could be so fun. Post cleaning the wiki template was completed, Steve, Matt and Caz dod some primer work and Nii and Narmada worked on the modelling some more.
