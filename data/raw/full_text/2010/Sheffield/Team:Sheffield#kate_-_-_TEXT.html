Name: Kate Bulpin
Powers: Ice manipulation.
Bio: Kate was born and raised in Somerset UK. She began an early career in the sciences by earning a degree in biology at the age of 21. It was during this time that a freak accident in the lab left the warm-hearted Kate with an icy touch. Seeing this as a blessing, she decided to put her powers only good use. Meanwhile, it was Kate's decision to focus an interest in social sciences, pursuing a PhD at Sheffield University in how people become scientists and develop a disciplinary identity. Her main role as part of the team is to catalyse the formation of ideas for their work on human practices as well as study the team as part of her own work.
