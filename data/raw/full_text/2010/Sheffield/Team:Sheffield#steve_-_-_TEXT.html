Team:Sheffield/steve
From 2010.igem.org
Template:Navigation
Name: Steven Garrett
Powers: Super Speed.
Bio: Steve's superpower was earned through sheer determination. Very few have pushed themselves to the point where their mind can push molecules faster allowing them to run at great distances at such short amounts of time. Steve also took an interest in Genetics from an early age and has successfully tied this in with competing against other runners on a regular basis. His contribution to the team is being master organiser, lab worker, researcher and purchaser for different parts required. Steve spends most evenings maintaining his super speed and competing against others. He is also a big fan of cheese, as this is his major fuel source for his ability.
