Team:Sheffield/28 June 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 28th Jun10 - It Begins.
Toyday's meeting was planned aiming to narrow down the project to something realistic and attainable during the 10 weeks. The session was attended by all the undergrads and Andy. A twitter account was set up - already Steve is addicted. Catherine received lots of our quizzing emails. We emailed Xia Huang, regarding the paper Cao, X., et al. "A New Method for Water Desalination Using Microbial Desalination Cells." Environmental science & technology 43.18 (2009):7148-7152. We emailed Environmentalbiotech.com to find out more information about their grease eradication system and also Sheffield Forgemasters about their waste disposal methods. A few ideas about order and layout of the wiki were talked about during the meeting, with some designs being drawn up for a logo. We've decided to go with 'Drip & Drop'... or 'Drop & Drip' the water droplets as team mascots (still a BIG ongoing debate between a few members). For desalination we decided an in-situ method would be most realistic. We would probably require well characterised halo-tolerant bacteria that can form a biofilm on an electrode. The system in theory would have a middle chamber where salt water is placed. Two flanking chambers would contain opposite electrodes sepatated from the middle chamber by selectively permeable membranes to either anions or cations. A broad area we looked at on this day was the destruction/removal of pollutants/pathogens from water supply. Our potential targets included iron, lead, nitrates, pharmaceuticals, fats, oils, grease, sewage, various pathogens e.g. cholera and toxins. Final note - team lunch of pizza at Rise @ the Hallamshire is definitely something worth considering again.
