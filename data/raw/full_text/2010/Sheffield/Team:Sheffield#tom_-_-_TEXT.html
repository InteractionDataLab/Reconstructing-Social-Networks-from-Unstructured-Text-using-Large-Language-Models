Name: Thomas Leach
Powers: Ability to photoshop the future.
Bio: Tom is the most local member of the Team having been raised in Doncaster. One night Tom was working on a graphics project and accidentally spilled a cup of tea on his laptop, causing his brain to rewire with a mystic force and his computer photoshop programme. He can now photoshop the future for his fellow iGEM teammates to interpret. Tom studies molecular biology at Sheffield University. His major contribution to the project is designing the web page, writing the diary and using his experience in the lab. In his spare time he enjoys playing retro computer game tunes on piano and swimming.
