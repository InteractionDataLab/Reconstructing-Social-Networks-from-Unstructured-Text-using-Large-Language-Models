Team:Sheffield/27 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Tuesday 27th July - Continuing with humman practices.
Today we pieced together some of our work from yesterday using the lists as a tool to make the next step for our work. Sadly the control from the cell cultures showed conttamination, so we autoclaved some pipette tips and made some more LB stock solution. Late on in the afternoon Tom and Matt attempted growing up the cells again with the sterile tips. If this works we're hoping to get some plasmid minipreps done tomorrow!
