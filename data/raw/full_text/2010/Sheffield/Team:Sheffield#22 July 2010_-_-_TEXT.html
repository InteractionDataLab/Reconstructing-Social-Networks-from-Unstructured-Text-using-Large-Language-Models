Team:Sheffield/22 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 22nd July - Back to work!
So we learned a lot from our trip to Newcastle. It's definitely kicked us back into work seeing how well into their project the other UK teams were. We began the day meeting at the IC for 10am. Tom worked on buttons, while Nii and Narmada worked on the Wiki and Steve, Matt and Caz did some gene ordering, lab work and ethics.
Andy popped us a brief visit to see how everything was going. We worked over lunch, as there was quite a bit to catch up on from our time away.
