Team:Sheffield/29 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 29th July - The team go ice skating
19:20 meet at the IC tram stop to go down to ice sheffield. We managed to leave Narmada behind - sorry Narmada! After getting off and waiting for the next tram the team was reunited. Bargain £2.50 entry - excited we got our skates on and began sliding. Many falls later (mostly by the very unfortunate Narmada who did indeed try her best) Steve began challenging everyone to a race around the rink. Tom managed to survive the experience void of falling and Andy showed off his skills of being the most talented skater of Sheffield Igem.
Post Ice, we headed to Bungalows and Bears to sit, chat, drink and play board games until the clock reached friday morning. Very pleasant evening and not too many injuries considering the high faller to non-faller ratio among the team.
