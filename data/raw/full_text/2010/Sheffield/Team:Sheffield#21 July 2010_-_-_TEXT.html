Team:Sheffield/21 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 21st July - Still in Newcastle!
A bit of a groggy start for the team members silly enough to carry on drinking last night in Eazy Street. Unfortunately this led to our late arrival to the morning talks - sorry to everyone there for our rather rude interruption! We did manage to take some interesting points about tips, safety and human practices from the talks, which will prove useful when we get around to adding more depth to our project.
After enjoying the last of the talks, we decided it was time to head home to Sheffield. Once we arrived in Sheffield Caz went to check our samples... WE HAVE BANANA AND WINTERGREEN E.COLI!!! - awesome.
We'd just like to thank Newcastle for organising the get together. We found the trip a great opportunity to socialise with other UK teams, learn some valuable tips for our work and to see how well everyone else is getting on with their projects. We'll look forward to seeing you and the rest of UK iGEM again at the Jamboree, best of luck with your projects, we hope all goes well!
