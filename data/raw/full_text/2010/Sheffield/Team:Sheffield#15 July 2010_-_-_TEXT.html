Team:Sheffield/15 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 15th July - Normal meeting in the morning. A bit more explanation was provided about the modelling and Steve looked at more gene quotes foor ordering. We had lunch at Las Iguanas to celebrate Nii's and Tom's 21st's - a couple of (very strong) cocktails on the house and a few bought by the team too. All in all an enjoyable day. Post lunch we discussed the genes more and what we wanted to order.
