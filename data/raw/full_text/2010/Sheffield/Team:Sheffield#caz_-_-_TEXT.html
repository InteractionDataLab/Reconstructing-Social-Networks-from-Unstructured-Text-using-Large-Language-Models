From 2010.igem.org

Name: Caroline Telfer
Powers: Shapeshifting.
Bio: Caz was also born in Bedford, but never had the chance to meet Matt until they both arrived to study Biomedical Sciences at Sheffield University. Although Caz had no powers at the beginning of iGEM, it was Steve that soon sensed her potential. Her first transformation was into Catherine Biggs, whom she still morphs into spontaneously at times. She is in charge of the team's emails and participates in most of the lab work carried out. Aside from iGEM, caz is interested in tennis and enjoys going to Wimbledon to watch the annual tournament.
