Team:Sheffield/28 May 2010
From 2010.igem.org
The whole team's very first brainstorm. Focusing on the water industry, we managed to develop some interesting ideas to research further, which include: 1. Self healing pipes - a method for pipes to 'recover' from damage using bacterial biofilms. 2. Water desalination - how we can use specialised bacteria to lower the salt content of sea water to make it drinkable. 3. Lowering nitrate levels - using bacteria to lower nitrate levels in rivers, helping to promote healthy living conditions for fish 4. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus ratios - alteration of these using bacteria to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria 5. "Bactoshave!" - the bacterial shaving system... (patent pending)
