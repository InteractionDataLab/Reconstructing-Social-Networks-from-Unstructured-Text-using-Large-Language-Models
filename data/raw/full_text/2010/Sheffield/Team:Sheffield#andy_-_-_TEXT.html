Name: Andy Balmer
Powers: Unknown.
Bio: Andy knew he had a gift from a very young age, he just didn’t know what it was. His early life was difficult until he recognised some of his talent, and ever since has been using it to form teams worldwide. His power to hunt out superheroes and bring them together into awe inspiring teams has been used to great effect for the iGEM project; however Andy’s true powers have still not been uncovered.
