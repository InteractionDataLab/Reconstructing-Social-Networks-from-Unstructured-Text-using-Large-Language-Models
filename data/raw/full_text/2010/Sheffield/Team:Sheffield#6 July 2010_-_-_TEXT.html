Team:Sheffield/6 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
The team's first proper lab day! We began with the boring part of washing apparatus, then by making liquid broth and agar cultures for the E.coli to be grown. As we waited for the equipment to finish autoclaving, we ventured to the IC to continue some more work and plans for the Wiki - note that more photos are now available on the 'team' page - mainly ridiculous ones from Facebook. In Steve's absence (from having to run in Glasgow), we chose an image on his behalf, which he's still yet to notice.
At 2pm we went back down to meet Qaiser to add Rosetta and DH1 alpha strains of E.coli to liquid media and agar plates (some with ampicillin). Basic microbiology technique was demonstrated to those who haven't had much experience of the lab. We also put Kate in control of the video camera while we were doing this - our collection now includes a video of Tom labeling ~50 plates... perhaps more work needed to be done on the lab videos.
After labelling, spreading and leaving to culture, we visited Catherine with Qaiser to discuss our progress and plans. Catherine seemed pleased, although following some of our questions, we left her pondering about what her superpower could be. Will she reveal this in our next meeting? Stay tuned to find out...
