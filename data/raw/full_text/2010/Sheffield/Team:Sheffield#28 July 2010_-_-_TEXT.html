Team:Sheffield/28 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 28th July - Meeting with Visaken and Steve to discuss modelling.
Tom, Steve, Kate, Narmada and Nii had a meeting with Visaken at 10am to discuss how certain processes in our engineered cells could be modelled and also so that those not from engineering could gain insight into how the whole modelling process works. Meanwhile Matt and Caz carried out some work in the lab making plasmid minipreps from the successful growths from yesterday's samples. Steve, caz and Mat then met with Qaiser to finalise some more orders. During the afternoon we took control of Catherine's Massive office to research modelling literature and develop some more images on photoshop. The compilation of the human practices work pictures has been made, which is great.
Lunch at Bungalows and Bears, which will probably double up as a new home for a very impressed Andy Balmer. Steve was surprised to hear voices in the toilet... this matter is being investigated further.
