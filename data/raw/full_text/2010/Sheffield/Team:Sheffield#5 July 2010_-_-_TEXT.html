Team:Sheffield/5 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 5th July - 10:00 am start again.
At 10:30 we're meeting with Qaiser in the lab to plan some more about the project.
Meeting with Qaiser went well. We made a list of everything that was needed to buy for the lab work. Lunch in City View Cafe where we began filming. Nii provided some interesting information about his family history, which would be nice to look through again on video (not all his statements were true apparently). The afternoon was spent designing a a layout for the wiki with Andy inventing new lyrics to Rhianna's 'rude boy' song - a version probably best left until after the watershed. Our ideas for the wiki have now taken a comic book theme - image development in progress. The layout should be soon to follow once the images are produced. An important part of the afternoon was spent planning the project and what exactly needs to be done within specific time frames.
