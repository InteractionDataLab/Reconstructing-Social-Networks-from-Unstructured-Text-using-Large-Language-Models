Team:Sheffield/16 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 16th July - Nii's 21st! We started the day in Qaiser's office having a chat about plasmids and which ones mighht be useful for having multiple copies of for the transformation. After our meeting, we ventured back to the IC to draw out the kinase cascade for ideas about modelling. Caz sent out a few emails too. As it was Nii's birthday, naturally there was more cake to be had. In the afternoon we decided to retry creating our banana smelling E.coli, as our previous attempt was a failure. Fingers crossed this works!
