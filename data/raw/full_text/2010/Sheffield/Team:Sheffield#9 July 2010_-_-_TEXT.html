Team:Sheffield/9 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
The team meet with Professor Artymiuk to talk about the best point to create the fusion protein. We met Qaiser in the morning to sum up our (very successful) Wednesday afternoon. 11:30 we went to our meeting with Prof Artymiuk, who agreed to help us with looking at the chimeric proteins.
Afternoon time we were taught another round of human practices by Andy. Today the main focus was on identity. This began with a brief history of how the philosophy of identity and language has changed over time, including insights from Plato (citizens and the noble lie); Descartes (demons and 'I think'), Nietzsche (leaves, saying yes!, creating our identities as we make them, the superman); Saussure (how perception itself can be based on language and the connectedness of meaning); and Feminisms. This was important for helping us understand how identity is made up as we go along - the meaning of something cannot be solidly defined, and is always within other related meanings that already exist. We'll have to have a think about how we can use this to help us approach our human practices questions about iGEM identity.
Barbecue in the evening at Caz's - perfect opportunity for team banter and to take advantage of the Sheffield sunshine.
