Team:Sheffield/12 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 12th July - Short day today. We began by innoculating samples from our MG1655 and DH5-Alpha E.coli strains in LB media. The rest of the day was spent writing our project abstract, sending out emails and completing images for the Wiki. Another productive day, but not much to report on in terms of our usual antics.
