Team:Sheffield/18 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 18th August - A day for modelling
Steve Wilkinson came to help Nii and Narmada by giving advice about how to carry out a function on matlab and to look at how they had modelled the system. The task for team lab was making loads of plates. Not much interesting to report frrom that aspect unfortunately, we're still waiting very patiently for our genes to arrive.
