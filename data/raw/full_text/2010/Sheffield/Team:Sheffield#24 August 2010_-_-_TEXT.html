Team:Sheffield/24 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 24th August
All day Nii and Narmada looked at ways to model promoters. There was quite a lot of lab work done by Steve, Caz and Matt, while tTom stayed at home (because of the rain) and finished transcribing his interviews.
Lab work was making a pgaA miniprep, running a restriction digest gel of PACYC-duet and PCDF plasmids. We also did a gel extraction PACYC-Duet. We also set up the digest overnight for pgaA.
Evening plans were at Steve's for pizza to talk about the next week and a half of labs. Lots of work to cram into such a small amount of time now!!!
