Team:Sheffield/2 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Normal 10:00 AM start. As predicted, the team were more awake and attentive, it was "Fantastic Friday" after all. The day started with some explanations of the main stages of our project on the white board. A few parts were ordered in the morning, now looking forward to receiving our first biobricks!
~12:00 we were joined by Andy, who was clearly impressed by our logos... okay minor exaggeration, he just laughed a lot. Following this he reminded us of our initial 'drip-drop' idea modified with his own design. We'll get that created on photoshop pretty soon hopefully.
After a lunch of bread cakes in the park, we started on our first 'human practices' lesson from Andy. We learned about deduction, inductive observations and how science is now thought to be falsification based. Over the next few weeks we're hoping to learn and show on our wiki how we understand our own identities, roles, status, diciplinary identities, project roles and differences between each other within the realms of synthetic biology. Are we students? Are we synthetic biologists? Is iGEM a competition or a collaboration? Is Catherine our peer or our boss? These questions we hope to answer in the form of interviews as the project goes along.
A lot to take in this week, but it's been a fun one. Plenty of 'in-jokes' going on to keep us lauging for the next 9 weeks. Next stop: the lab!
