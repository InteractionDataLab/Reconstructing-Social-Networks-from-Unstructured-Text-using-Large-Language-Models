Human Practices Outputs
 
Report
Our major output was the  human practices report " Developing Human Practices Devices "
 
Identity interviews:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with our team members and with members from other teams across the world. We then produced a report on our interviews about iGEM identity.
You can see our interview questions list here.
 
Sociotechnical  circuit:
Take a look at some images of the development process of making a sociotechnical circuit.
We produced a number of video montages of the images of the sociotechnical circuits maps. But they're huge files so we've drastically slimmed one down that you can see here . It's really small and poor quality but you can see how the coloured objects move over time. If you take a look at some of the images of making a sociotechnical circuit that will help you see what is happening too.
Socio-technical circuit diagrams show the final output  format of this device.
To understand the sociotechnical circuit diagram you can  read our key and explanation of the above circuit.
The major analysis of our sociotechnical circuit is in the  main report (link above).
 
Lab ethnography  notation device:
You can download the notation we developed here .
A good way to understand the notation device is to see a  worked example, so you can see a notation snippet from the lengthy worked example of a  series of transformations.
That whole series of transformations is also available in  notation form.
A more detailed explanation of the device and its use is in  the main report (link above).
 
Collage part:
Here are some pictures of our collage being made and some pics of the final object
To understand the collage part better you can read our main report (link above).
 
Ethics:
Whilst conducting our inteviews on identity we also asked some questions about ethics and regulation. We've written a report on the findings from these inteviews that shows how iGEMMERs think about ethics and suggests some ways to use our human practices devices to investigate more interesting ethical questions in future.
