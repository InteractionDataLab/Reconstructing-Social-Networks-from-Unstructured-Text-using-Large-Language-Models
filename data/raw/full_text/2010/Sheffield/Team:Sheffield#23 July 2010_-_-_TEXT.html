Team:Sheffield/23 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 23rd July - 9am start!
Despite the rain, we all managed to make it to the IC for 10 by the latest. Steve and Matt took care of looking at plasmid vectors for the genes we've ordered. Tom designed the Campest E.coli EVER for our logo... heavily criticised, so back to the drawing board on that one Tom.
Lunch was spent at the Frog an Parrot for a healthy serving of nachos, burgers and curly fries, yum. After lunch we headed to the Bioincubator. Steve, mat and Andy sat playing PewPew on their iPhones, whilst Tom, Caz and Narmada did some real work. Tom and Caz made some competent BarA knockout MG1655 E.coli cells and stored them in the freezer with messy messy glycerol. In between centrifuges and incubations Tom and Caz joined the rest of the team, which led to Tom's injured toe on the stairs between rooms. Hope it gets better Tom. Finally we ended our Friday (less fatigues this week) together in city view cafe having a laugh and enjoying each other's company as alwyas (awww).
Over and out week 4!
