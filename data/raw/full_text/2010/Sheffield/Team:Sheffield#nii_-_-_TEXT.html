Name: Nii Armah Armah
Powers: Able to feeze time through the medium of dance.
Bio: Nii's powers are of an unknown phenomenon. Since his childhood (born in West London) he has always complained of a distracting beat that at times becomes so powerful he feels an insatiable urge to break into dance. Only recently has this evolved to a state that Nii sees time freeze around him when he persues this beat. One release Nii has found from this is by concentrating on unrelated tasks. This led to him pursuing an undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering and joining the iGEM 2010 team. Nii concentrates on modelling work, but also participates in web designing and livening everyone up. His outer interests remain unknown.
