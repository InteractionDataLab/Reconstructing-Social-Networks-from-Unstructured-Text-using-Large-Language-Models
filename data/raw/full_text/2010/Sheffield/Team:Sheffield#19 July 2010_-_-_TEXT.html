Team:Sheffield/19 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 19th  July - Early (9:00 am) start for a few to attempt to get some more web design done. We started labs today by finding out that our banana E.coli had once again failed, but we're still determined to get E.coli that don't smell like E.coli, so for part of the day we transformed a wintergreen and 2 other banana plasmids into E.coli, in case there was a problem with the DNA in the first well.
Meanwhile we looked at sponsorship and added some finishing touches for our presentation in Newcastle tomorrow. At 15:30 we presented our progress to the advisors fearing a grilling...
Grilling again was not as bad as expected. The advisors were impressed by all of our work so far and were happy that the genes we ordered cost much less than what they were fearing. After completing our presentation, we worked a bit on the buttons for the wiki and on some genetics.
