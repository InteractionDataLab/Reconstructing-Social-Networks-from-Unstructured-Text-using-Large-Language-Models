Thursday 19th August - Transformation
The task today in labs was preparing transformations. Steve, Matt and Caz transformaed about 10 different biobricks in the competent cells which took up a lot of the day.
Team modelling tried to find out what was wrong with their code, as they didn't manage to get the correct sigmoidal curve. During the afternoon we all went down to Catherine's (MASSIVE) office to make some more progress on our collage. Only a little more to do after this and PLENTY of clearing up to do.
