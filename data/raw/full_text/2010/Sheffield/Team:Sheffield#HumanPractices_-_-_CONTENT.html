Having decided on identifying pathogens as our project goal, we deicided that  'identity' could be a guiding theme for our whole project and that our human  practices could be a series of experiments in and reflections on the notion of  identity within synthetic biology. This concept of identity has been used in a  number of ways: we’ve looked at how individual teams  make their collective identity, with a particular focus on our own team;  we’ve examined how individuals within a team make an identity through relations with people, objects and places; and finally we explore how individuals' participation in their iGEM project is shaped and embedded within the wider context of the competition, their 'parent' institution and their histories of diverse disciplinary education. 
 We think all of these will be important for thinking about  the formation of a new kind of interdisciplinary researcher for a new kind of  interdisciplinary field. </P><P> </P><P><EM>            Our human practices as parts and devices</EM></P><P> </P><P>            To explore these questions we have used some traditional  methods from social studies of science and some new methods that we have  developed within the iGEM model. We think about these new methods as being  human practices parts and devices, which we think future iGEM teams should try  and develop, combine and invent in the future. To understand more about what we mean by human practices devices please read our main report, which you can see on our 'outputs' page. We’ve produced quite a few outputs, which you can explore using the links below.
