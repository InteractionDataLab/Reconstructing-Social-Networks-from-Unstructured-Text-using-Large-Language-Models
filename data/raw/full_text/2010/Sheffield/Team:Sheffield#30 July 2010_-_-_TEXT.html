Team:Sheffield/30 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 30th July - Half day
10am start. Much to do, Steve and Matt looked at primers that need to be ordered with Qaiser, while Caz managed some cell transformations since the previous batch didn't work. Tom, Nii and Narmada worked on Modelling and graphic design. 12:30 marked our meeting and presentation to some important people at the University. Our presentation work seems to be improving, another successful piece of work by the team. Andy was impressed with how we handled the questions at the end too - thumbs up!
After the meeting there wasn't much left to do apart from head back home and enjoy the early start to the weekend. Much deserved Igem team, we've worked hard this week.
