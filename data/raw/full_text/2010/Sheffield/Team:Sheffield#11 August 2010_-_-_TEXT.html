Wednesday 11th August - Say Cheese!
In the morning Steve, Caz and Matt began some transforming E.coli with some of the iGEM biobrick plasmids. The aim is to grow up some cells, then extract the plasmids to use for our own biobricks. Tom finally made the template work so now our homepage is visible to all... some very important info still to come on our 'About our wiki' section so stay tuned! Nii and Narmada constructed their models... almost finished now too!
During the afternoon Andy, Matt, Caz and Steve worked with Kate to bring our human practices work up to date. Might be good to keep on top of it from now on, does tend to get quite messy when we've left it a while.
We finished around the normal time ~ 5pm.
Tonight's plans - Steve hosts the most cheese for the cheesiest come dine with me yet at Caz's! On the menu: cheesy music, cheesecake, cheese fondue, cheesy peas, macaroni cheese, cheese salad, cheese indeed. good job we're all lactose tolerant *phew*.
