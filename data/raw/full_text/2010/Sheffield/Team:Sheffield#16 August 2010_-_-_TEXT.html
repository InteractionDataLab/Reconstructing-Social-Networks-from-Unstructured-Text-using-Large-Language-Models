Team:Sheffield/16 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 16th August
For most of the day Steve, Caz and Matt were autoclaving, pouring agar plates and preparing LB. Ampicillin and kanamycin plates were prepared separately and together. The restriction digest performed on the plasmid didn't work unfortunately, as the DNA ladder was too high in concentration compared to the palsmids.
Meanwhile Tom began profiling the team on the wiki and made 2 interviews, one with Groningen and the other with Harvard for human practices. Nii and Narmada tried to work out how a histidine kinase could be modelled by researching literature.
