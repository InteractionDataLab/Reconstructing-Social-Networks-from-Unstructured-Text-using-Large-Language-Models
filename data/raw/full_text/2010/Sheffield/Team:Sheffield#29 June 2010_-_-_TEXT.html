Team:Sheffield/29 June 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Today we got a guided tour of our labs for the very first time courtesy of Qaiser Sheikh. Exciting stuff! We looked at the proteins TonB and ExbB for potential use in our desalination cell. The fuel cell desalination idea was adapted to just a desalination cell consisting of 3 chambers without electrodes, with chambers following the same order as before, but this time with a chloride sequestering bacteria in one chamber and a sodium sequestering bacteria in the other. This still needs some research to work out how realistic this idea is. We liked Newcastle's project from 2009 and considered how Bac-Man might be able to aid our project this year in this area. Removing nitrate in sewage treatment plants may also hold potential. We would be looking at ways to lower the amount of nitrate released by the plants using novel bacteria with a consortium of enzymes to 'mop up' the excess. The process could also be energy productive, opposed to energy consuming (where aeration is concerned). Finally we're looking into developing the work done by the Sheffield 2008 team. This was a project aiming to detect the presence of cholera, however due to complications the team could not complete their project. Lunch today - sandwiches in the sun in Weston Park. Tom, Narmada and Caroline revealed their vegetarianism to the rest of the group *gasp*.
