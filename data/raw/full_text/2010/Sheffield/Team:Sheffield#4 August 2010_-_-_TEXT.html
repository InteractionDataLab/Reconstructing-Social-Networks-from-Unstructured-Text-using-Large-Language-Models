Team:Sheffield/4 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Wednesday 4th August - Come dine with me.
More sciency work done during the day - pretty much the same as we've been doing every day - modelling, a bit of lab work with competent cells. To break up the afternoon Kate begun her interviewing for our human practices work. We were used as guinea pigs to test the questions and how long each interview would last. This was important to show how well the questions would work for interviewing other universities. Interviews lasted approximately an hour, so we decided it might be agood idea to cut them down slightly.
Evening plans - Andy's house! The team were treated with homemade bruchetta for a starter, homemade pizza for main and chocolate roulade/lemon tart for dessert... and of course plenty of wine to wash it all down with. On the agenda was our usual 'inuendo' packed conversation and board games including 'articulate'. Conclusions from the evening: Andy is a brilliant host with excellent cooking skills.
Word of the day: 'Schindler's Lift'
Food of the day: Balmer's Bruchetta
Beverage of the day: Wine... of course
Place of the day: Riverside... Let's go! *do-do-do-do-do*
