Team:Sheffield/26 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 26th July - The day everyone forgot.
We started the day meeting with Qaiser at 10am to order some plasmids. In the afternoon we got the ball rolling for the bulk of our human practices work. We made lots of lists in the meeting room to set the framework for tomorrow. Tom and Caz also tried to grow up some plasmids in the BarA knockouts (chloramphenicol resistant).
