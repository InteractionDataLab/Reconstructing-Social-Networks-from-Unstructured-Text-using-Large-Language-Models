Team:Sheffield/12 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Thursday 12th August - Recovery
After a night of cheese and laughs it was time to get back to work. 10am start for Nii and Narmada who needed to meet with Krish to discuss the modelling work they sent him. Steve, Caz and Matt went to the labs for 11:30, but yesterday's experiments unfortunately weren't successful for making plasmid minipreps. Tom stayed in city view working on the wiki until mid day. Andy arrived at around 12 so that we could start our collage for human practices.
