Team:Sheffield/7 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 7th August - Friday again.
Another 10am start. Today we got the green light for ordering 3 different promoters for using in front of our synthetic genes to activate and also for use as biobricks. The wiki was developed some more to give a new effect upon hovering over the buttons - now with a 'lighting' function. Sadly Nii and Narmada's meeting was delayed in the afternoon.
During the evening the team retreat back to their places and welcome the weekend with tired smiles.
