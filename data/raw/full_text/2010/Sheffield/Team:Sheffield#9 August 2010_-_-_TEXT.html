Team:Sheffield/9 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Monday 9th August - Slowest day ever
It appears there must have been something in the water today because the team just couldn't concentrate on their tasks at hand. Overall a few emails were sent, a few plans were made, but nothing too interesting to report on unfortunately.
Conclusions - Every team has their slow days. Today was one of those unfortunate days for the team, but don't fret - tomorrow will be better!
