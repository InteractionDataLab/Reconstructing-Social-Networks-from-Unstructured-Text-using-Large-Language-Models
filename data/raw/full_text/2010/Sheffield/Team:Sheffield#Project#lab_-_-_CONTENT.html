</PRE><P>Friday 9th July: First Day in the Labs
</P><PRE>	Looked through the Freezers to see what was left by the previous 2008 iGEM team. 
	Found two strains of E. coli, DH5 alpha and MG1655, which were spread onto LB agar to test for viability. 
</PRE><P>
Monday 12th July: E.coli are Viable
</P><PRE>	Both strains grew showing that they are viable. 
	Overnight primary cultures of each strain were set up in 5ml of LB broth
</PRE><P>Tuesday 13th July: Practice Transformations and Competency Experiments
</P><PRE>	Both strains of E.coli were made chemically competent<A href="/wiki/index.php?title=1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1 (page does not exist)">1</A> using the overnight cultures made on the 12th. 
	The now competent cells were transformed with part BBa_J45014 from the iGEM kit plates(Banana odour).<A href="/wiki/index.php?title=2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="2 (page does not exist)">2</A> This was done to test both our transformation and competency methods. 
	After transformation the cells now containing part BBa_J45014 were spread onto ampicillin agar plates and put into a 37°C incubator overnight. 
</PRE><P>Wednesday 14th July: Transformation Failure
</P><PRE>	Neither strain grew on the Amp plates. Suggesting that either our cells were not competent or that the transformation did not work. 
</PRE><P>Thursday 15th July: BarA Knock Out Arrives
</P><PRE>	BarA Knock out KSB837 strain E.coli arrives. 
	5ml of LB broth was inoculated with the BarA KO and left to grow in a 37°C incubator overnight. 
</PRE><P>Friday 16th July: Second Attempt at Transformations
</P><PRE>	The transformation attempted on the 13th of July was repeated and left to grow over the weekend.<A href="/wiki/index.php?title=1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1 (page does not exist)">1</A>

</P><PRE>	The Transformations grew. 
	Tested the banana using isoamyl alcohol which produced a banana smell. 
	However the lab did not have the correct substrate for the winter green odour producing cells so we could not confirm that these cells transformed. 
</PRE><P>Friday 23rd July:
</P><PRE>	Made some competent BarA knockout MG1655 E.coli cells and stored them in the freezer with glycerol <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="1 (page does not exist)">1</A>.

 Lane 4 - Cut Chimeric sequence
 Lane 5 - Uncut Chimeric sequence
</PRE><P>Friday 24th September
</P><PRE>	Two experiments were set up to test the function of the BarA KO E.coli the contained the cholera system and HapR-GFP promoter in response to the cholera auto-inducer CAI-1: 
</PRE><P>1.) Simple test: 
</P><PRE>	For a simple test of the cholera system based approach the BarA KO strain which contained both the cholera system and the HapR promoter(with GFP) was grown for 1 hour at 37°C in 5ml LB (containing Cm and Amp). Then 5μL of the auto-inducer CAI-1 was added and the E.coli was left to grow again for 2 hours at 37°C. 
	After the 2 hours the sample was centrifuged at 13,000rpm for 1min and excess LB was removed from the top of the sample to concentrate the sample. 
	The concentrated sample was staged on a slide and looked at under a fluorescent microscope which was successfully able to identify bacteria producing GFP. 
</PRE><P>2.) Characterisation: 
</P><PRE>	An overnight flouresomter kinetic was set up for the co-transformed E.coli in a 96 well plate as shown bellow: 
 Row 1 - LB control
 Row 2 - No CAI-1
 Row 3 - 0.5μL CAI-1
 Row 4 - 1.0μL CAI-1
 Row 5 - 5μL CAI-1
 Row 6 - 10μL CAI-1
 Row 7 - MG1655
