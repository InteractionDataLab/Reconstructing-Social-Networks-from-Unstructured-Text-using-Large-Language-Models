Wednesday 25th August - Busy bees
During the morning Tom, Caz, Matt and Steve all went to the lab to carry out plasmid minipreps in the different bacterial strains and run a gel extraction with the pgaA promoter followed by PCR of the DNA. In the afternoon Caz carried on transcribing her intereviews. Nii and Narmada worked on modelling the gene expression for most of the day.
