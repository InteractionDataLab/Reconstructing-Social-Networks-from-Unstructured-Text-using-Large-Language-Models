Team:Sheffield/3 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Tuesday 3rd August - Not much planned, just work.
The team arrived on time in the morning (minus Steve who was off to London to compete in a race - best of luck Steve!). Tired from our night bowling, we begun work for the day - still as eager as ever though. The transformations from yesterday proved unsuccessful, and to make things more confusing the negative control was the only sample which grew. Time for Caz and Matt to grow some more competent BarA KO cells up that aren't so backwards.
We also worked on some more human practices today. Kate helped us create some questions for the interviews with other universities.
