Team:Sheffield/13 August 2010

Friday 13th August - Unlucky foor some
The plan for today was to get some more interviews on the go. We tried to get as much done as possible on human practices, but unfortunately work went quite slow. We've officially made a mess of Catherine's massive office, so plenty of cleaning to do before she comes back. Steve, Caz and Matt went to the lab to conduct Thursdays experiments again after an setback had occurred from the day.
