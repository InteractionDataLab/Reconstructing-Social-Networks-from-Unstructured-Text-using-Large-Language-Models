Team:Sheffield/1 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
The team say "White rabbit" for good luck. The aim is to look at the catalogue of parts, decide what we need and a create suitable logo. We should check out getting visas for the Jamboree too. Potential for some Wiki work today - ours is looking a bit scruffy at the moment.
Following the trend so far of 'every other day is a slow going day' we kept the theme going. The morning started with sending out a few emails and a bet for who would be the first to reply. Catherine won the race and Caroline lost a bet. A look was taken at the biobricks from the registry and the important ones were noted down. Following a working lunch, we held a logo design competition with a 10 minute time limit. Of the designs, we managed to produce a 'killer-coli' (complete with blood of the Cholera it had just dismembered... lovely), a 'Dr. E.coli' (stethoscope included), good vs evil microbes under a microscope and numerous others. As all designs seemed quite well matched in skill and imagination, we decided to postpone deciding on a winner for another day and let Andy have the final verdict.
After the excitement of all that drawing a few of the team headed home. Tom and Steve paid Qaiser another visit to have a look at some of the 2008 samples in cryogenic storage and to talk about some more possible ideas to expand the project. Ideas included thinking about different ways our biosensor could be used and apparatus that would make this successful. We also talked about the hybridized protein we're hoping to create - sequence alignment suggests this should be okay, but there's only one way to find out for sure, by testing! Next stage is to identify the region that needs to be annealed from the cholera receptor protein. Productive day overall, but chances are tomorrow will be more poductive if our trend so far is anything to go by.
