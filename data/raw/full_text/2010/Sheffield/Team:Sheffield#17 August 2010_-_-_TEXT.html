Tuesday 17th August - Re-restriction
Steve, Caz and Matt attempted the restriction digest again with a lower concentration of ladder DNA compared to the plasmids. Tom returned home in the morning for a bit to carry on work on the wiki before returning at 2pm to interview DTU-Denmark. Nii and Narmada had a meeeting with Qaiser to try clarify some technical aspects of the modelling. Tom, Matt, Caz and Steve later plated out some cells to see if the transformations were successful on the Kanamycin and Ampicillin plates. At 5pm Tom interviewed Virginia.
Evening plans are at Matt's for homemade curry and Tekken!
