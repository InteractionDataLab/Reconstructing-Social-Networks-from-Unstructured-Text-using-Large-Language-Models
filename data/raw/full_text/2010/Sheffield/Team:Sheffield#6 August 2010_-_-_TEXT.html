Team:Sheffield/6 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 6th August - Friday feeling!
Seems the team roles have settled for the time being - Nii and Narmada had a meeting with Visaken in the afternoon to discuss modelling our whole system. Tom worked on design and Steve, Caz and Matt made some more science. The team end the week ready for another iGEM weekend. Week 6 over - it's crazy how fast this is going!!!
