Team:Sheffield/20 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Friday 20th Sheffield - An achre of office to clean.
For most of the day we were in Catherine's office finishing off our identity collage. Lab work was also interspaced during the day to make another load of transformations, as all of yesterday's work was unsuccessful. The most important transformation of the day was with the pgA promoter.
Last thing left for the team to do was to clear up the whole load of dirty mugs, paper and crumbs we left all over Catherine's office. Let's hope she doesn't read this eh. Time for the weekend!
