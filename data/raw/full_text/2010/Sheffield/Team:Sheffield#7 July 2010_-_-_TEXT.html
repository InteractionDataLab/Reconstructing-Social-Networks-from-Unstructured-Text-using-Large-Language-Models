Team:Sheffield/7 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
10:00 AM we began the day by mixing up some samples with glycerol and putting them in the freezer. We were then given plenty of calculations to do by Qaiser, which took a while to warm up to, but we eventually got over our maths allergies & worked out the solutions. We also worked out which compounds we were missing from the buffer solutions, so these were added to Qaiser's list of things to buy.
In the afternoon, we decided to return to the IC to organise for the Jamboree and work on some more wiki. Visa 'waifer forms' were located and some of the details about going to Boston were done. 2 of the artwork buttons for our homepage were completed, 8 more to go!
