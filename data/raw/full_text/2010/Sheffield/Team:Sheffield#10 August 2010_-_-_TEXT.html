Team:Sheffield/10 August 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Tuesday 10th August - Working our way back up
After a rather mundane monday, we were keen on making amends. Morningtime Tom spent the day weaving the homepage on Dreamweaver. Nii and Narmada went on the hunt for some equations and were successful in their endeavours. Steve, Caz and Matt went back down to the lab to make some more cell based progress.
We used the afternoon productively to continue interviews with Kate and move forward with our human practices work. Plenty of sticky note mess all over again. The end product is an exciting thought!
Also it is important to note the team have now located the kettles in the bioincubator. One can predict tea will become an essential mind fuel for most of the team from now on. Tea.
