Plasmid Prep using Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep Kit </P><P><LI type="disc"> The pET-3A vector plasmid that is to be used for the transformation needs to be purified </LI><LI type="disc"> 
The pET-3A plasmid was purified using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocols</LI><LI type="disc"> 
The only difference made to the protocol is that only 5ml of Buffer QC was used on the 2nd wash step</LI><LI type="disc"> 
The plasmid (two samples A &amp; B) as well as some column flow-through collected at different stages of the purification were run on a GelRed post-stained 1.5% agarose gel and photo taken for visualization (see below).</LI><LI type="disc"> 
A NanoDrop spectrophotometer reading was also recorded to check the quality of the extracted genomic DNA.</LI><LI type="disc"> 
There was no DNA pellet formed at the end of this protocol so we may have lost some DNA</LI><LI type="disc"> 
There was also some plasmid observed in some of the column flow through so some plasmid has been lost</LI></P><H3> Figure 10. Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep results: </H3><P><B> Figure 10. </B> GelRed post-stained 1.5% agarose gel of pET-3A Plasmid purification. In lanes 1, 4, 5 and 15 there is a 1kb Molecular ladder. In lane 2 there is the Plasmid purification sample A and in lane 3 is the Plasmid purification sample B. In lanes 6 to 14 there are flow-throughs that were collected at different stages throughout the protocol. There is some DNA visible in these lanes so some of the DNA has been lost.  Possibly genomic DNA they are quite high (didn’t move through the wells)</P><H3> Nanodrop results: </H3><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Sample</TH><TH>Concentration</TH><TH>A260/280 ratio</TH></TR><TR><TD>A</TD><TD>36.6ng/uL</TD><TD>1.71</TD></TR><TR><TD>B</TD><TD>35.0ng/uL</TD><TD>1.73</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>

Looking at these results it seems that we have approximately 100uL of 36.6ng/uL plasmid sample A and approximately 100uL of 35.0ng/uL plasmid sample B. </P><P>

A restriction digest will confirm that it is plasmid DNA not genomic DNA.</P><P><BIG><B>

Plasmid Prep using Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep Kit (2nd attempt)</P><P><LI type="disc">We attempted to purify the pET-3A vector again using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Prep Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocols</LI><LI type="disc">The plasmid (two samples A &amp; B) as well as some column flow-through collected at different stages of the purification were run on a GelRed post-stained 1.5% agarose gel and photo taken for visualization (see below).</LI></P><H3>Figure 11.

In lanes 1 and 9 there is a 1kb Molecular ladder. In lanes 2 – 9 there are the column flow throughs that were collected at different points throughout the protocol. In lanes 2 and 3 there is a feint band visible but this is expected as it is sample collected before the addition of sample to the column.</P><LI type="disc">Less DNA has been lost in the column flow through with this attempt however as we suspect that the plasmid is still contaminated with genomic DNA we decided to be safe and use another type of plasmid prep kit as well.</LI><P><BIG><B>

Plasmid Prep using Invitrogen Midi Prep Kit</P><P><LI type="disc">The pET-3A plasmid was purified using the Invitrogen Midi Prep Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocols</LI><LI type="disc">The plasmid (two samples 1 &amp; 2) were run on a GelRed post-stained 1.5% agarose gel and photo taken for visualization (see below).</LI><LI type="disc">A band was seen for sample 2 but no band was observed for sample 2</LI><LI type="disc">This protocol has been successful but not enough plasmid has been purified</LI></P><H3>Figure 13. Plasmid Prep using Invitrogen Midi Prep Kit results </H3><P><B>Figure 13.</B> GelRed post-stained 1.5% agarose gel of pET-3A Plasmid purification using Invitrogen Midi Prep kit.

23rd/24th October  2010 </BIG></P><P>Unfortunately, assembly of our biobrick part to submit to the registry was not successful when we followed the instructions given on the iGEM website (OR, our cells have mutated!!).  </P><P>

We have discovered that the linearised vector simply won’t cut with SpeI and we can only cut with EcoRI and PstI. </P><P>

We have therefore suggested a new strategy – please see our <B>‘Safety’ </B>page which shows the modification of the current protocol describing ligation in of a single Biobrick part with these two enzymes. </P><P><BIG>
25th October  2010 </BIG></P><P> Last attempt to assemble biobrick!
</P><P>
We have digested one of the Kan or Amp plasmids in the distribution kit that has a small part with XbaI and PstI and mix with EcoRI - SpeI digested pGEM-T-AT-Bph clones. We have then ligated with some of the linearised plasmid they supplied that we digest with PstI-EcoRI.</P><P>

The following three restriction digests were set-up
<OL><LI>EcoRI-PstI of the linearised vector. </LI><LI>SpeI 1hr followed by EcoRI 1hr of the AT-Bph gGEM-T clones 1 and 7. We did 5uL of each in 10uL digest volume.</LI><LI>XbaI-PstI digest of a part in well 23L in the distribution plate. Dissolve well contents in 10 uL water and digest 5 uL of this with XbaI and PstI. Total volume of digest was 10 ul. (It is not in the C3 vector.  This part is just a double terminator part.)</LI></OL></P><P>

Heat inactivate all then mix 3 uL of each, 1.1uL ligase buffer and  0.5 uL ligase. Ligate over lunch!! (2hr) and transform in the afternoon onto LB-Chloramphenicol plates. </P><B><P><BIG>
26th October  2010 </BIG></P><P> Biobrick assembly, phew!
</P></B><P>
We have about 12 transformants on the rbs-ATBph-terminator plates and on the AT-Bph-terminator plates!!</P><P>

If these get inoculated this morning into LB-Chloramphenicol they should have grown enough by 4pm this afternoon to do minipreps.</P><P>

We have inoculated 2 ml LB-Chloramphenicol with 10 of the #7 transformants and 1 of the #1 transformants. There may be a few others growing up but only these colonies were large enough to inoculate to liquid. Cells were put in shaking incubator for 7 hours for minipreping in the afternoon.</P><P>

Restriction enzyme digest confirmed we have a biobrick!</P><H2> Testing the ‘switch’ with biliverdin added to liquid cultures </H2><P><I>Nothing like working to a deadline!!</I></P><P>
The bacteriophytochrome containing cells were grown overnight in 5mL liquid culture (LB + amp) containing Biliverdin of varying concentrations and also IPTG to turn on expression of bacteriophytochrome, as follows:</P><P><LI type="disc"> The cells were tested for their ability to convert light using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy as follows: YES IT WORKS = <B> success! </B></LI></P><P><LI type="disc">100μL of overnight bacterial cultures were also run on a SDS PAGE.  100μL of the cells were centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 40 μL SDS Page Sample Buffer (5 X concentrated).  The cells were boiled for 2 minutes and loaded onto a 10% Bis-Tris Mini Gel (Invitrogen).  Two gels were run, one with 8μL of the cells (low concentration) and one with 15μL of cells (high concentration). The SDS-PAGE gels were run at 180V for 35 minutes and stained in 10mM zinc acetate solution for approx 15 minutes.  
</LI><LI type="disc">
Staining with zinc will induce fluorescence of the bound biliverdin chromophore to the bacteriophytochrome.  The complex can be then visualized following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using fluorescence.
