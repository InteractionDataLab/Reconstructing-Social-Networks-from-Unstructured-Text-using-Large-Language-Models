About Macquarie University
Macquarie University, a welcoming community which is comprised of 31,000 students, with 8,800 international students from over 114 countries.
Macquarie University is ranked as one of Australia’s top nine universities and one of the top 40 universities in the Asia-Pacific region. We are recognised for having an innovative curriculum, high-quality teaching and research, and unique campus environment.
Students that are involved in this community are all encouraged to develop qualities, skills and knowledge essential to their future success.
Macquarie’s goal is to reach the top eight research-intensive universities in Australia and among the top 200 in the world by its 50th anniversary in 2014.
Macquarie has recently established the Australian School of Advanced Medicine, advanced into high-technology engineering, and identified concentrations of research excellence (COREs), meaning the Macquarie concentrates on distinct research areas of the highest quality.
Macquarie also has doctoral research partnerships with 53 universities from 22 countries.
