Top five survival tips for future iGEMers!!!....(the do’s and don’t’s!)
1. Start on the Wiki early!
Get in contact with a computer nerd! Or pick a team member to be the ‘Wiki Chief’ and learn a few things about Wiki editing!
2. Organisation… the Key to success!
Plan your experiment well and take into consideration time limitations, shipping time, equipment available!!
3. Be realistic!!
Don’t go TOO overboard with crazy and unachievable  goals
4. Team work
Work cooperatively as a team and use your team members strengths to your advantage and help them work on any weaknesses
5. Most importantly
Have fun!!
We only get to be in this competition once so make the most of it!!!!!
We hope our tips help future teams!!!!
