1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
When working in any laboratory there are always risks involved that need to be taken into consideration. The Macquarie University 2010 iGEM team took precautionary measures designed to minimize the risks that could not only potentially affect individual researchers but also the public and the surrounding environment.
Each individual team member completed a laboratory induction-training course and signed an acknowledgment to confirm that they had completed the course. The signed acknowledgement included safety measurements such as where any fire extinguishers and other safety equipment were located as well as the safe use of all machinery in the lab.
Additionally, a seminar was provided by the Macquarie University Chemistry & Biomolecular Science Department’s Technical Manager of Chemical Safety officer – Jenny Minard, to explain Workplace Health and Safety. Topics including the safe storage and documentation of chemicals (such as MSDS’s and risk assessment forms) were discussed in detail.
In the laboratory, we always use protective clothing such as lab coats and gloves when handling all bacterial cultures and DNA samples. The bacterial strains used in our experiments are considered non-hazardous and non-infectious and culture volumes were kept to a minimum so that any risk of spread was minimized.
No harmful chemicals were required for use in these experiments. In particular, Ethidium bromide is not used to bind DNA for agarose gel visualization because of its carcinogenic properties. At Macquarie University, the use of ethidium bromide has instead been replaced with newer staining reagents such as GelRed.
A Material Safety Data Sheet was completed for all chemicals and reagents used in the laboratory. All workspaces were kept clean to keep sterile conditions and bacterial waste material was auto-claved prior to disposal.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, we do not consider the two cloned genes to be Biosafety hazards. The Bacteriophytochrome gene is a pigment-binding protein and the Heme Oxygenase gene is a metabolic enzyme. This means that we did not have to document any issues in the registry.
3. Is there a local Biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
There is a local Biosafety committee at Macquarie University and all experiments which may involve biosafety risk and/or which involve cloning or transformation of organisms within the University need to obtain approval by the committee before proceeding.
The committee adheres to Australian Government’s legislation: Gene Technology Regulations Act, 2000 . The Biosafety committee granted approval for the 2010 Macquarie University iGEM project prior to commencement of in vivo methods such as cloning and expression (approval number REF: 5201001087EX).
Additionally, as mentioned above the Chemistry & Biomolecular Science Department’s Technical Manager of Chemical Safety officer – Jenny Minard was made fully aware of all chemicals and reagents to be used in the experiment and her approval was obtained.

4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
As the iGEM competition is getting more popular each year the number of parts to be submitted is growing. Better documentation and standardization of parts is required.
Suggestion for amended BiobrickTM instructions
The instructions that can be accessed on http://partsregistry.org/ Help:Spring_2010_DNA_distribution provide an explanation on how to use the linearised plasmid backbone. We found these instructions to be slightly confusing and a little misleading, particularly as it says "All you need to do is cut with EcoRI, PstI and DpnI to leave two ends ready to be ligated to a Biobrick™ part". Used in this way, it effectively incapacitates the ability to further use this BioBrick in an assembly process.
The protocol given (http://partsregistry.org/Help:Protocols/Linearized_Plasmid_Backbones) is one that describes how to use these linearised backbones to assemble two parts together in a single ligation reaction. This is not the same as using the linearised backbone to insert a single Biobrick™ part into the linearised vector as implied in the usage instructions.
Below is a modification of this protocol to describe how to ligate in a single Biobrick part as well as renaming the use as previously described to make the usage clearer.
