Safety
We experimented with the following conditions
in order to ensure "researchers safety", "public safety" and "Environmental safety".
The laboratory has the structure and equipment for basic biological experiments.
We inactivate waste, including living genetically modified organisms before waste.
We inactivate genetically modified organisms before waste or use the contaminated facilities, equipment or the instruments.
We inactivate genetically modified organisms on the bench immediately after it attached.
While experimenting, we have closed the lab door (Except when entering or leaving the lab.).
We have close the lab window in order to prevent entry of insects or etc..
In all procedures, we minimize the generation of aerosols.
When taken out from the laboratory of living modified organisms, we put them into the container and seal it.
We wash our hands after handling living modified organisms in order to prevent the infiction of them.
We have the parson who do not have knowledge of the experiments not to enter the laboratory.
In addition, our Biobricks do not have the safety issues.
We observed the law “Attacks for bioethics and safety ( English / Japanese )” (established by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan) and meet the safety standards.
Attribution and Contribution
Attributions
We rely on Mr.Kawahara to tell us “how to raise some money”, “where to experiment” and so on ; however , we put all our heads together and we experimented on iGEM TMU members own , without someone(adviser , instructor)’s help.
Contributions
We helped Edinburgh Team by answering their questionnares.
We helped UNAM-MEXICO Team by answering their questionnares.
We helped Warsaw Team by answering their questionnares.
