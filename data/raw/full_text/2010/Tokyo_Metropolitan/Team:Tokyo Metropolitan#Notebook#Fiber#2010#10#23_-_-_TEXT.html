Experiment:Sequence
bcsA (No.9)
Big Dye
primer
DW
ethanol
EDTA
Hi-Di solution
procedure
mix materials(DNA<50ng)
PCR
Add EDTA and Ethanol and put at room temperature (15min)
centrifuge (8000rpm,30min) and throw away supernatant
add ethanol again
centrifuge (8000rpm,15min) and throw away supernatant
add Hi-Di solution
heat at 95℃
transfer these sample to plate for sequence
read sequence
result
bcsA wasn't inserted into pSB1C3...
Experiment:Colony PCR
material
colony of E.coli
bcsB:1~32
bcsC:33~64
bcsD:65~96
other materials were same as protocol3
procedure
see protocol3
Experiment:Electrophoresis
material
PCR production (Colony PCR)
you can see other materials at protocol4
procesure
refer to protocol4
result
From the length of bands
bcsC→No.54 and 64
