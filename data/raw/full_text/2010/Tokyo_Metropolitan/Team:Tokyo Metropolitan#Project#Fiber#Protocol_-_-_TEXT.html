Protocol1:Grow up a culture of A.xylinum
Material
Acetobacter xylinum JCM 7664 strain
1L of Acetobacter medium(From Open Wet Ware)
Glucose:2.0g
Peptone:5.0g
Yeast extract:5.0g
Na2HPO4:2.7g
Citric acid:1.65g
Distilled water:~1L
Equipment
autoclave
incubator
scale
bunsen burner
flask
plate(*SANPLATEC)
spreader
pipette
pipette tip
Procedure
Prepare media as outlined (add the materials as above)
Autoclave to sterilize medium(121°C 20minute).
Streak/inoculate A.xylinum onto plates or in media.
Incubate cells at 28°C for 2-3 days.
Note
The growth of A.xylinum does not give a cloudy appearance in the medium, the medium will remain transparent to slightly translucent in appearance.
The growth of A.xylinum is accompanied by the formation of a thick cellulose matrix within the media that must be removed before cells can be pelleted for a miniprep procedure. Simply vortex briefly to break up the cellulose into chunks and remove the cellulose chunks from the media with a pipette while carefully avoiding the removal of cells.
A.xylinum will grow well at room temperature in aerobic conditions.
Protocol2:Grow up a culture of E.coli
Material
E.coli K12 strain
1L of LB medium
LB agar:35g
Distilled water:~1L
Equipment

Procedure
Prepare medium as outlined (add the materials as above).

Protocol4:Agarose gel electrophoresis
Material
1% agarose gel
agarose S (*Nippon gene)
TAE buffer
ethidium bromide
1×TAE buffer
10×Loading buffer
template DNA(PCR/digestion production)
Equipment
microwave
gel box
flask
Procedure
Measure out agarose into a beaker with TAE buffer and Microwave until the agarose is fully melted(5minutes×3).
Let the agarose cool on your bench until touching the bottom of the beaker with your bare hand doesn't burn you (~5 minutes for a 50mL gel). At this point add your DNA stain, e.g., ethidium bromide. The beaker will cool unevenly (surface first), so you must be careful not to cause ripples and bubbles.
While the solution is cooling, seal the open edges of your gel box with one long piece of masking tape on each side. Make sure it is sealed well or the gel will leak.
Pour the agarose solution into the taped gelbox. Carefuly pop or shove to the side any bubbles, put in the comb, and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid.
If your gel is at all purple, and you are using ethidium bromide as the DNA stain, you need to decrease your concentration by at least a factor of ten.
Set agarose gel and add TAE buffer in gel box.
Mix DNA and Loading buffer and then put in well them(marker sets another well).
Load DNA at 100V for two third of entire(about 15minutes).
Image the consequence of electrophoreses.
