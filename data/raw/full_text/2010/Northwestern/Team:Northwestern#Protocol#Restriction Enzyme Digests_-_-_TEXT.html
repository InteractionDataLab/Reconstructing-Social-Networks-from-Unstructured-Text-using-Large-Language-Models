From 2010.igem.org
Materials
Restriction enzymes ( EcoR I , Spe I , Xba I or Pst I ) from NEB
NEB2 buffer
BSA
Nuclease free H2O
Digest Mix
Example - 50 μL reaction. 100 μL reactions are also common especially if your DNA to be cut is dilute.
5 μL NEB2 buffer
X μL DNA ( ~500 ng).
0.5 μL 100X BSA
1 μL BioBricks enzyme 1
1 μL BioBricks enzyme 2
(42.5 - X) μL deionized, sterile H2O
Digestion
Digest at 37 degrees for 1.5 hours
Heat kill for 20 minutes
Add 1 μL Phosphotase to backbone
Incubate for 30 minutes @ 37 degrees
