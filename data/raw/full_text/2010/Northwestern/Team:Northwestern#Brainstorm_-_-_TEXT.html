Project Brainstorming
Round 1: Group Brainstorming Session
Health/Medicine
Release in presence of wound signal (pH) Factor VIII    Symbiosis with human body    Selective phagocytosis (absorb toxin)    Selective phagocytosis (lead)    Phagocytosis for drug overdoses    Drug sensing bactera    Bacterial spermicide            Drug delivery method through WBC    Apoptosis with drug delivery when disease is recognized    Vitamin and mineral delivery    Bacteria that takes up excess ions in the body    Self Healing material: growth factor    Apoptosis in presence of a particular disease    Swine Flu testing on site    Target bad cells selectively based on offset in circadian rythmn    Cure celiac’s with bacteria    Ethrypoeitin production in e. coli    Thrombolytics in presence in LDL    Thrombolytics in precense of clots (macrophages)    Bacterial pacemakers
Food/Energy
Supplementary vitamin and minerals to be grown on produce    Removable pesticide bacterial film    Cheese reservatrol    Splitting Hydrogen from water    Electrogenesis: produce voltage from bacteria
Environment
Consume gases in the air (ozone)    Consume (CFCs)    On site radiation testing (make it click like a Geiger counter)     Breaking down plastics (look at past presentation)    Photo-driven battery
Manufacturing/Industrial
Trace explosive Bacteria    EXPLODING BACTERIA    Bacterial Superglue    Resistors    Capacitors (Storing charge)    Phagocytosis for water in shoes    Bacterial barometer    Bacterial paper to print on     Active pH buffer for e. coli (target pH)        pH meter    Cilia creating fluid flow, generating fluid current    Create ferrofluuid to create magnetism    Bacteria to regulate the temperature of a surface (endothermic and exothermic reaction)    Long lasting bacterial sunblock    Bacterial Clothing     Thermal heating for toes    Adjusting Young’s Modulus    Contracting  group of cells    Thermometer    Bacterial film that responds to laser so you can sketch on it. (express GFP light induced promoter)    Bacterial Gears
Miscellaneous
ELISA for DNA    ELISA for mRNA    Magnetic Bacteria     Faster biodegradation (Signal activated ) (isn't this environmental?)    Oncoprotein expressed on the outside missing ligand binding portion    Cytoskeleton in bacteria    Engineering current flow  intracellularly    Bacterial gyroscope    Bacterias that produce primers    Proteosome into e. coli design system to keep at steady state to keep e. coli alive    Nail polish (grow back or fade away)    Tight junctions into bacteria    Synthetic Apoptotic signal (and isn't this medical?)    Music Playing Bacteria: loudspeaker    Clock using bacterial gears    Non Newtonian fluid bacteria (using force)    Bacteria piston using sinking and floating mechanism    Gap junction music playing    Rotifers: surviving without water mechanism (protein protection)    Engineering signal glycoproteins into bacteria (integration of virus disrupts reporter gene)
Round 2: Official 2010 iGEM Draft
Each member chose 3 favorite topics to research
Sean - Opsin, Electrogenesis, Tight Junction
Avi - Proteosome, Storing Charge, Magnetic Field
Ben - Pacemaker, Factor8, Excess Ion uptake
Matt - Self Healing Material, WBC, Bacterial Thermometer
Timi - Splitting Water, Primer Production, Oncoprotein Express
Jeremy - Circadian Rhythm, pH meter, Cytoskeleton
Ragan - Selective Phagocytosis, Erythropoietin Production, Inducible Apoptosis
Round 3: Presentation and Voting
Voted on the basis of: Sexiness, Available Parts, Feasibility, and Applications
Narrowed Down to: Cytoskeleton, Magnetic Bacteria, and Self Healing Armor
Round 4: Group Discussion
Cytoskeleton Discarded
Self-Healing Armor altered to Bacterial Skin
B-Cell/T-Cell Response Modeling Introduced
Magnetic Bacteria relegated to side project
Round 5: Presentation and Final Voting
Main Project: Bacterial Skin
Side Project: Magnetic Bacteria (Magnetite Synthesis)
