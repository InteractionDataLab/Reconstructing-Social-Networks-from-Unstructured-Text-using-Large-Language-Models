Chitin is an abundant biopolymer found primarily in the exoskeletons of arthropods, including many insects and crustaceans. Composed of N-acetylglucosamine monomers (Figure 1), it functions analogously to keratin in mammalian skin, providing a support matrix for the protective outer surface of these animals. Similarly, most fungi produce chitin in their cell walls for structural support. Chitin production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on a series of enzymatic steps (Figure 2).

One enzyme in this pathway, chitin synthase 3 (CHS3), was previously found to be among the most active chitin sythases in the chitin synthase family of enzymes and does not require additional cofactors to function. As a result, we use CHS3 as the chitin production mechanism in our inducible system ( BBa_K418007 ).

Chitin has many applications, particularly in medicine and industry. Currently, nearly all chitin is obtained from natural sources (i.e. shells of crustaceans). Thus, a method of recombinant chitin production may have commercial applications. Several examples of chitin usage are listed below:
SIGNIFICANCE OF CHITIN:
Medicinal Use:
Wound and burn treatment/healing
Hemostasis for orthopedic treatment of broken bones
Viscoelastic solutions for ophthamology and orthopedic surgery
Abdominal adhesion treatment
Antibacterial and antifungal agents
Tumor therapies
Microsurgery and neurosurgery
Treatment of chronic wounds, ulcers and bleeding (chitin powder)
Industrial Use:
Food/Pharmaceutical/Agricultural/Cosmetic thickener, stabilizer
Agricultural protection
Water resistant properties
Dietary supplement
Water purification
Edible microcrystalline films used to preserve food
Sequestering of particles (i.e. oil)
Biodegradable/non-pollutant
