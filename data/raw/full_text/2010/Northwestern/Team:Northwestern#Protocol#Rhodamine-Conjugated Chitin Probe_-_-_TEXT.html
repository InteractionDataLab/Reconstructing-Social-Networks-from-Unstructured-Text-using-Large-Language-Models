From 2010.igem.org
Methanol Fixation
Rinse slide with ethanol and flame
Rinse slide with PBS and dry with KimWipe
Apply cell sample to microscope slide and let air dry
Submerge in -20C absolute methanol for 5-10 min
Wash 3 times with 1X TBS (submerge in 1X TBS for 5 minutes per wash)
Do not let cells dry for the rest of the procedure
Staining
Make 1:500 dilution of chitin probe in TBS (50ul of probe is used per slide, [49.9ul of 1X TBS]:[0.1ul of chitin probe] --> 1 slide)
Apply 50ul to the slide containing the sample
Allow stain to incubate overnight at RT in a dark room
To prevent stain from evaporating overnight: Use a large glass petri dish. Soak a paper towel with PBS and place it at the bottom of the petri dish. Use 2 toothpicks to support the slide above the paper towel. This prevents any wicking action from occurring and pulling the stain off the slide.
Wash 3 times with 1X TBS (submerge in 1X TBS for 5 minutes per wash)
Place a cover slide over sample. Image sample using fluorescent microscope
