Primers
We use enzyme x to work with DNA sequences, it is installed on all the macs and has nice translation and reverse complement functions.  Many of the same functions are available in a plasmid editor , which has Mac, Windows, and Linux versions.
Forward Primer
identify the bases that code for your residue of interest (eg. 295-297)
A - Copy the 10 bases before the codon (eg. 285-294)
B - Write your new codon after the 10 bases you just copied
C - Copy the 22 bases that follow the codon (eg. 298-319), I always terminate in a G or C
your forward primer should be 5'-A-B-C-3'
Reverse Primer
D - Copy the ten bases after the codon (eg. 298-307) - then reverse complement it!
E - Write your new codon - then reverse complement it!
F - Copy the 22 bases that precede the codon (eg. 273-294) - then reverse complement it!
your reverse primer should be 5'-D-E-F-3'
When they arrive make a 20uM stock
I use netprimer to make sure the primer Tm is good.  You should have a rating above 70 (above 80 is preferable) for your primers.
PCR
Recipe
1.25ul of 20uM Primer F
1.25ul of 20uM Primer R
10ul Phusion Buffer (5x)
1ul of 10mM dNTPs
0.5ul Template DNA (from miniprep, preferably from DH5alpha cells, but BL21 is still dam+ so it should be fine)
1.0 ul Phusion polymerase
H2O to 50uL
Cycle
98C for 30s
98C for 5s
53C for 20s
72C for 20s/kb (usually plasmids are ~7kb = 2:20)
Cycle 16 times - more cycles are actually bad!
72C for 8:00
4C for hold
If you are using a different polymerase the annealing/extension/denaturing times and temperatures will be different!!
DpnI and transformation
After PCR, add 1ul of DpnI to each pcr tube
Incubate 1 hour-O/N at 37C
PCR Purify using Qaigen kit
Add 5ul of PCR reaction into 25ul DH5alpha cells
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Heatshock at 42C for 45 seconds
Recover on ice for 2 minutes
add 200ul LB (if in 96 well or 8 strip format) to each reaction
shake at 37C for 1 hour
plate on warmed antibiotic plates
If it doesn't work
Miniprep more colonies... ;)
order PAGE purified primers
