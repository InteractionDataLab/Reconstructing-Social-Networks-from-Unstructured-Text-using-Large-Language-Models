E. lemming - a remotely controlled living robot by ETH Zurich
Motivation & Project Idea
What is E. lemming?
E. lemming is the 2010 iGEM project of ETH Zurich. We control the movement of a single genetically modified E. coli bacterium by hijacking chemotaxis. Position and direction of the bacterium is monitored by image processing algorithms, which are linked to a controller device. Find out more about our motivation and project idea!
E. lemming - The Movie
Watch a short animation of the project idea!
We created a short animation about the project idea and general concept of E. lemming. Find out, how we combine biology and information processing to create E. lemming.
Biology & Wet Laboratory
How is it implemented?
By coupling proteins of the chemotaxis pathway to a light-sensitive spatial localization system, the chemotaxis activity can be controlled reversibly. To find out more about our project on the molecular level and its biological implementation, visit this section.
Mathematical Modeling
How does modeling help?
Mathematical modeling supports analysis of biological systems since the advent of synthetic biology. Find out, how this supported wet laboratory experiments by providing time and effort alleviating network structure and experimental design selection. In addition, the combined model was a perfect test bench for information processing.
Information Processing
How is it controlled?
Implementation of a comprehensive information processing workflow for controlling E. lemming was achieved by combination of microscopy, image processing, cell detection and a controller. Find out more about how this not only created E. lemming, but also created a new application for synthetic biology: Gaming!
Achievements
What was achieved?
See videos of E. lemming in action! We created a BioBrick and a Matlab Toolkit, which can be used for similar projects. Learn more about our comprehensive systems design and systems implementation approaches, which were necessary for the success of E. lemming.
