From 2010.igem.org
Light-input system coupled to chemotaxis model (Sorokina/Mello)
The Sorokina model will be coupled to the Mello model. This is done by expanding the single molecular models to a single DAE model.
At the moment, the implementation is not working.
Goals
Link model to Mello chemotaxis ODE models
Define experimental conditions
Status
Please find the current version on the SVN-Server.
(8/12): (SVN rev. 15) Goal 1 in progress
(8/14): (SVN rev. 16) Goal 1 in progress
(8/15): (SVN rev. 17) Goal 1 in progress
Tasks
Fix the implementation
Verification & Discussion
I will continue to work on this model. If you would like to help, please check the SVN server for the current version and send me an email regarding your participation.
Results
Goal 1
Please see SVN Rev. 17 for first try: ./SorokinaMello
