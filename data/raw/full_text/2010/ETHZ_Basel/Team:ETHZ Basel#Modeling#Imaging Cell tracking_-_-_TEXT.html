Imaging
In order to control (or direct) the cell, we need to detect the current direction of its movement and the location, so that it could be communicated to the control logic that decides if the cell should be allowed to swim straight or make a turn.
The algorithm we implement will have to be fast enough to work on a live video stream so that there is sufficiently less processing delay for the control logic to work in real time. This is the main challenge of the cell tracking algorithm.
More information about the development of cell tracking and its current status can be found in the Cell Tracking page.
