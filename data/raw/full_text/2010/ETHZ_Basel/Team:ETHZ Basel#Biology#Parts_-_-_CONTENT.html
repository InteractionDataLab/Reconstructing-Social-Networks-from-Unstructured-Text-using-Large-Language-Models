This was made with the various models the dry-lab team implemented in order to help us prioritizing. 
We had to consider the following parameters. The detailed explanations for our choices you find by clicking on the question itself which is internally linked to the appropriate wiki page:
</P><UL><LI><A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Modeling/Experimental_Design" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Modeling/Experimental Design"><B>Which Che protein should we choose?</B></A> - We chose CheY  as the first target. 
</LI><LI><A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Biology/Molecular_Mechanism" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Biology/Molecular Mechanism"><B>Which anchor would work the best?</B></A>: TetR was the first choice due to its wide application in synthetic biology and extensive characterization. Our second choice was the ribosome binding domain of trigA
</LI><LI><A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Modeling/Experimental_Design" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Modeling/Experimental Design"><B>Which LSP should be fused to the Che protein. PhyB or Pif3?</B></A>: There was no rational preference which LSP to fuse to the Che protein, so we decided to fuse PhyB to the Che protein.
</LI><LI><A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Modeling/Experimental_Design" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Modeling/Experimental Design"><B>Ratio anchor to binding partner</B></A>: The simulations favored a ratio of 50 µM anchor to 40 µM of anchor binding partner.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_realization"> Experimental realization </SPAN></H2><P>After getting the input from the modeling side concerning experimental design, we had to realize or verify the stated parameters in our biological implementation.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Fusion_proteins">Fusion proteins</SPAN></H3><P>First at all, according to the given input, we decided to assemble the following fusion proteins: CheY fused to PhyB as Che-fusion as well as TetR fused to Pif3 and Trigger factor fused to Pif3 as anchor-fusions. As we faced some problems regarding the assembly strategy which we only could fix recently, fusion protein assembly is still in progress. We summarized our <A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Achievements/Technical_Standard" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Achievements/Technical Standard"><B>experience</B></A> regarding the assembly method to avoid that other people make the same mistakes and came up with a <A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Achievements/Technical_Standard" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Achievements/Technical Standard"><B>strategy</B></A> to link it to Tom Knight`s original assembly method.
</P><P>While troubleshooting the assembly method we started to implement E. Lemming using our second system: <A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Biology/Archeal_Light_Receptor" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Biology/Archeal Light Receptor"><B>an archeal light receptor fused to E. colis serin transducer (Tsr)</B></A>. And that one actually worked. Check out our first implemented <A href="/Team:ETHZ_Basel/Achievements/E_lemming" title="Team:ETHZ Basel/Achievements/E lemming"><B>E. Lemming!</B></A></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Implementation_chassis">Implementation chassis</SPAN></H3><P>As we want to change the tumbling frequency of E. lemming by spatial localization of CheY it is important to use a strain for implementation which does not express wild type CheY but only our CheY fusion protein. Therefore, the system will be implemented in a <I>cheY</I> knock out strain which was taken from the KEIO collection [1]. For implementing E. lemming using trigger factor as anchor, we constructed a double knock out <I>tig cheY</I> as all ribosomes should be available to bind the trigger factor fusion protein and not WT trigger factor. This strain was constructed by P1 phage transduction using both strains from the KEIO collection [1].

Errors for the copy number determination were calculated from three independent experiments.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>For the implementation of E. lemming we need to express two fusion proteins simultaneously in one cell. The LSP1 fused to the anchor and the LSP2 fused to the Che protein. To ensure that all Che proteins can be localized, the anchor fusion proteins should be present in slightly higher amounts. The experimental design favored a ratio of 1.5 (50 uM of anchor fusion to 40 uM of Che-fusion). To keep the system as simple as possible we decided to express both proteins from the same type of promotor, the arabinose inducable PBAD promotor. Thus, the only way to adjust the amount of fusion protein expression was by the number of gene copies per cell. We therefore constructed the working vectors based on two different origins of replication (pBB1 and RK2) and measured the actual copy number per cell to verify the optimal ratio of 1.5.
For plasmid copy number determination, we prepared plasmid DNA from a known number of cells (OD measurement at 600 nm and correlation of OD600 to colony forming units after plating serial dilutions), measured the obtained amount of DNA (using a commercial Miniprep Kit for extraction an a Nanodrop - which compares the absorbance at 260 nm with an internal standard - for measuring the DNA concentration), and calculated the number of plasmids per cell. All experiments were done in triplicates. The results are shown on the right.

For successful anchoring we needed to be sure to provide enough anchor places within one cell for the anchor to bind to. For TetR that means that we have to provide enough tet operator sites where it can bind to. For Trigger factor we need enough ribosomes it can bind to. In both cases this means that we have to provide about 50 µM of anchor places. 
</P><P><B>Can we provide enough anchor places for TetR?</B></P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Determination of the copy number per cell for pUC19</B> As pUC19 carries 7 Tet operator sites, its copy number per cell was determined to calculate the number of actual anchor sites for TetR</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>7 Tet operator sites (sites were TetR bind to on the DNA) were cloned into pUC19 (ori ColE1) and the natural ampicillin resistance of pUC19 was changed to a gentamycin resistance to make it compatible to our working vectors which express an ampicillin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance. 
To calculate the amount of tet operator sites per cell we determined the copy number of pUC19 and calculated the estimated anchor places. As TetR binds as a dimer to each operator site, 14 TetR can anchor on one plasmid. As we measured to have 267 copies of pUC19 per cells (the measuremnt was performed as described for working vector 1 and 2) we can provide 3867 anchor places per cell. Assuming a cell size of 1 µm this gives about 2.7 µM of anchor places. One possibility to increase the number of Tet operator sites is simply cloning more sites into the pUC vector. 
</P><P><B>Can we provide enough anchor sites for trigger factor?</B></P><P>Regarding <A href="http://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=y&amp;id=102217&amp;ver=0&amp;hlid=34655" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bionumbers (The Database for useful biological numbers)</A> the number of ribosomes per cell strongly depends on the growth phase and growth rate. In the mid-log phase at a growth rate (per hour) of 1 to 1.5 there are assumed to be 13 500 to 26 500 ribosomes per cell. Given a cell size of 1 µm we end up with 9 - 18 µM of anchor places. As we want to implement E. lemming in a genetic background missing the wild type gene for trigger factor, we can be sure that all ribosomes are free to bind our anchor fusion. Nevertheless the amount of anchor places is still not perfect but regarding the number we are able to provide we think that using trigger factor as anchor might be more promising than using TetR.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Nicely_swimming_cells_under_the_microscope-_not_an_easy_task.21"> Nicely swimming cells under the microscope- not an easy task!</SPAN></H3><P>To finally implement E. lemming, we needed to be sure that it would nicely swim and tumble under the lens so we would be able to detect it, track it and guide it by light. 
Therefore, we tested various growth conditions - minimal media, LB broth, different growth temperatures and growth phases - to find the optimal conditions for imaging E. coli single cells. Furthermore, different bacterial strains were investigated to find the most active one in term of chemotaxis.
</P><P>The two videos show how the swimming behaviour of <I>E. coli</I> varies with growth conditions.
</P><P>As a conclusion, growth in in Lysogeny Broth at 30 °C to an OD of about 1.0 of the strain <I>E. coli</I> K12 presented the best microscopic pictures of chemotaxis and these were thus the conditions we applied for our E. lemming.

</P><P>Therefore we came up with some functionality assay to test our constructs:

For that purpose we designed the BioBrick mCyPet &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K422014&lt;/partinfo&gt;, which has a distinct fluorescence spectra.

Furthermore, the reversibility of the dimerization could be investigated. As our assembly is still in progress, localization data has not yet been generated.
