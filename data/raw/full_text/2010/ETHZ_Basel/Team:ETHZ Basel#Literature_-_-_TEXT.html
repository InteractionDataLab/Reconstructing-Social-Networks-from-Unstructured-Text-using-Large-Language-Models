Literature
This section will be removed before wiki-freeze!
Please add every important literature here. This don't necessarily only have to be papers... When you add something, please put a red big "NEW:" in front of it. I will delete once in a while the "News" from everything which is not new anymore. Please add a short sentence why it is interesting for us.
Tagging of PhyB

PhyB/PIF Light Input
• People who have developed the PhyB/PIF3/Gal network: "A light-switchable gene promoter system", Shimizu-Sato (2002), nature biotech, http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v20/n10/abs/nbt734.html
• Same idea, a little bit differently constructed. “A switchable light-input, light-output system modelled and constructed in yeast”, Sorokina (2009), Journal of Biological Engineering
• Same genes, but a little bit more what we do. In vitro and maybe (didn't get it), in E-Coli: Leung (2008): “Genetically encoded photoswitching of actin assembly through the Cdc42-WASP-Arp2/3 complex pathway”. PNAS.
• Possibility of PCB production in E. coli (additional biobrick). http://www.pnas.org/content/98/19/10566.full.pdf+html
• Again PCB synthesis: We can use already existing parts: http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I15008 and http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I15009 . They have both "one star". Maybe a biologist takes a short look and finds out if we just have to throw them in or if we have to modify something.
• They produced a working light input system in E-Coli. Although I think we cannot use their idea, this paper is very interesting since they also used PCB as chromophore. Thus, this chromophore seems to work in E-Coli. When I understand it right these are the same guys who put the parts for PCB synthesis (see above) into the registry: • Levskaya."Synthetic biology: Engineering Escherichia coli to see light", Nature 438, 441-442 (24 November 2005). http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/abs/nature04405.html
• More or less the same principal, but with a little bit more description of the experimental setup: http://polaris.icmb.utexas.edu/paper-pdfs/Cell_EdgeDetector_2009.pdf
Other Light sources
• Proteorodopsin pumps protons through the cell membrane upon light activation: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1892948/
Movies
• Chemotaxis E-Coli with cell tracking: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ5ATNJfuCs&NR=1
• Additional Movies of Chemotaxis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHbqOD_OQU&NR=1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P9hvlsF9_c&NR=1 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZE11gg4c1s
CheR
• The guys who found CheR: It's not membrane bound and \Delta CheR strains swimm smooth without tumbling in a constant environment (exactly what we want). However they can still react to step inputs: "Identification of a protein methyltransferase as the cheR gene product in the bacterial sensing system", PNAS February 1, 1977 vol. 74 no. 2 533-537, http://www.pnas.org/content/74/2/533.short
• The structure of CheR is already identified. Images and the .pdb files: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=1AF7 and http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=1BC5
Microscope Control, Cell Detection and Tracking
• The software our microscope control will be based on (only for those who are interested): http://www.micro-manager.org/
• Some cell detection and cell tracking, only for yeast and relatively slow, but relatively nice: http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v4/n2/full/nmeth1008.html
• Matlab build in image processing/object detection capacities (fast): http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/images/f0-8778.html
Che proteins
• This paper fused different Che proteins (CheY, CheZ, CheA) to fluorescent proteins for localization purposes. The CheA fusion was not functional, but the CheY and CheZ fusion was (3x or 5x glycine linker, C- and N-terminal fusion). http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119046035/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0
• Here you see a nice summary of the effect of different Che Mutations and even double mutations on chemotactic behavior. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC220204/
Softwares
• NEW: BCT - deterministic software for simulating chemotaxis movement: http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/groups/comp-cell/BCT.html
• NEW: StochSim - extremely popular soft for stochastically simulating large number of biochemical networks: http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/groups/comp-cell/StochSim.html
