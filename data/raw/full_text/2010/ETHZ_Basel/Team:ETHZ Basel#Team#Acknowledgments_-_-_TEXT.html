Acknowledgements
iGEM 2010 has been quite a journey. It is our pleasure to be grateful to those who helped us reach where we aimed.
We thank our sponsors DSM and ETH Zurich for funding our project. Nevertheless, when it comes to the implementation, we are grateful to Fabian Rudolph, Andreas Meyer, Christian Femmer, Ralph Streichan, Nils Goedecke and Rolf Moser for their support. Furthermore, we are very thankful to the advisors of the team: Christoph Hold, Mario Marchisio and Vincent Rouilly, for those thoughtful and inspiring comments and the discussions that clarified our thinking.
Finally to say the least, this project would not have been possible without the support of our supervisors Sven Panke and Joerg Stelling.
Contributions
Contributions done to our project by non-team members:
Christoph Hold - helped with the implementations of one of the molecular models and the stochastic movement model.
Fabian Rudolf - helped with microscope setup, general advice for experiments.
Ralph Streichan - helped with bonding the channels (for microscopy).
Nils Goedecke - helped with general advice regarding the microscopy chamber.
Andreas Meyer, Christian Femmer - helped with cloning.
