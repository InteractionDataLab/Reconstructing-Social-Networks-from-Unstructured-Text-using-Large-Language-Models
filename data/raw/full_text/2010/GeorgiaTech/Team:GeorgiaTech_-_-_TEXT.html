From 2010.igem.org
Welcome!
As Georgia Tech's very first competing iGEM group, we have embarked on the journey of discovering how we can synthetically engineer heat producing bacteria. After extensively investing various organism's methods of heat production, we have found great promise in the AOX gene used for themogensis in many plant species. Please explore our site to learn more!
