Instructors
Dr. Joshua Weitz
Dr. Joshua Weitz is a quantitative biologist interested in the structure   and dynamics of complex biological systems.  He received his PhD in   Physics from MIT in 2003 and was a NSF Postdoctoral Fellow and Associate   Research Scholar at Princeton University from 2003-2006.  Dr. Weitz   joined Georgia Tech in 2007 where he is currently an Assistant Professor   of Biology with courtesy appointments in Physics and Bioengineering.    Dr. Weitz is the recipient of a Burroughs Wellcome Career Award at the   Scientific Interface and is funded by the James S. McDonnell Foundation,   NSF, and DARPA.  His research group includes ecologists,   mathematicians, physicists and bioinformaticians working on four major   research themes: (i) viral dynamics at the molecular, population and   evolutionary scales; (ii) quantitative systems biology and   bioinformatics; (iii) structure and function of vascular networks; (iv)   theoretical ecology and epidemiology. The work in the Weitz group is   primarily theoretical in nature, and utilizes the tools of nonlinear   dynamics, stochastic processes, and large-scale data analysis to   interact with experimentalists. Examples of recent and ongoing projects   include studies of collective decision making in bacterial viruses,   robustness and fragility of gene regulatory networks to copy number   variation, unsupervised approaches to binning short environmental   sequence fragments, network phenotyping and classification of root   system architecture, and a Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of allometric   scaling models in biology.
Dr. Eric Gaucher
Dr. Eric Gaucher exploits a multidisciplinary approach towards research to generate an 'evolutionary synthetic biology'. This combination of molecular evolution and biomedicine provides a better understanding of basic molecular processes while simultaneously generating biomolecules useful for industrial and therapeutic purposes. Dr. Gaucher received his Ph.D. in 2001 and then worked for NASA until 2003 studying the Origins and Evolution of Early Life. He was then Researcher/President of a non-profit research organization until 2008 at which time he accepted an Associate Professor position at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Richard In-Ho Joh
Richard is a fifth year graduate student in the School of Physics working on theoretical studies of alternative cell fate determination in Weitz Lab.  He received his BS from Seoul National University prior to coming to US.  In addition to his theoretical background, he has a great interest in the experimental molecular biology.
Dr. Mark Styczynski
Dr. Mark Styczynski uses experimental and computational techniques to study the connections between the different layers of regulation in cells and the cells' ultimate phenotypic outcomes.  Of most interest to his lab are metabolites, the small molecule building blocks necessary for all cellular functions both as source materials and as cues that prompt regulation and other cellular responses.  He studies metabolism in a variety of systems ranging from yeast to human cancer cell lines. Dr. Styczynski received his PhD from MIT in 2007, was a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute from 2007 to 2009, and joined the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech in 2009 as an Assistant Professor.
