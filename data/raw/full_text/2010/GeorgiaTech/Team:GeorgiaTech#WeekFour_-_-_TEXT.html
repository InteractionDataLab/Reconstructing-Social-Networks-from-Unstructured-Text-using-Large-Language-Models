8/23/2010
Cold shock results:
One red colony on IPTG plate at 4C (first  observed at 9:20 am on 8/20/2010) and one red colony observed on IPTG at 15C  (8/23/2010).
8/23/2010
Purpose: try to maximize expression of mRFP.
Making a “starter” culture:
1. From 4C NON-IPTG plate, take a white colony  and place in approx. 3mL of LB/CARB media.
2. Incubate with shaking overnight at 37C.
8/24/2010
Purpose: from starter culture monitor OD to  obtain OD600 of 0.4-0.5.
1. From starter culture take 50mL liquid culture  and add 50uL CARB in a large Erlenmeyer flask.
2. To this, add 1mL from starter culture and  begin monitoring OD (for each aliquot take 1mL for measuring OD); maintain  flask at 37C incubation with shaking. Keep in mind that e-coli doubling time is  20 minutes.
3. Put on incubator/shaker at 11:20 am, with  initial total volume of 51mL, and OD600 = 0.0.

4. Put incubator at 15C. During the cooling  period, the flask was kept at 6C to ensure that the colony quit growing. Final  OD was 0.57 before putting in the incubator (without shaking) for 30 minutes.  (Time in: 1:30 pm). Total volume of the flask at this point was 47mL.
5. At 2:00 pm, remove flask from incubator and  IPTG (100mM) to a final concentration between 0.1 and 1mM (choose 0.25  mM).  For a final concentration of 0.25mM  IPTG in a 47mL solution, add 117.5uL of IPTG (100mM stock).
6.   Continue culture with shaking at 15C for 24 hours.
8/25/2010
Results from 8/24/2010: expression unsuccessful.
Start with fresh colonies from the plates from  8/19/2010.  Since we know the mRFP made  it successfully into the pCold vector on the two colonies that turned red, try  to make starter cultures from those.
Making a “starter” culture:
1. From 4C and 15C IPTG plate, take a red colony  and place in approx. 3mL of LB/CARB media. (3mL LB + 3uL CARB).
2. Incubate the two tubes with shaking overnight  at 37C.
Plan for 8/26/2010: Make cultures as we did on  8/24/2010 again, monitoring the concentration of cells.  Then run a miniprep to ensure that we have  the mRFP inserted into the pCold vector.
8/26/2010
Successful growth of starter colonies. Repeat  process from 8/24/2010 until cell concentration is OD600 = 0.4 to  0.5.
1. Prepare 2 flasks (1 for each starter colony)  acccording to directions from 8/24/2010.
2. Repeat procedure from 8/24/2010. (final  concentration of cells in each flask was approx. OD600 = 0.4). Amount of  (100mM) IPTG added: 125uL to each flask.
3. Incubate with shaking overnight at 15C.
8/27/2010
WE GOT RED FLASKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now, we’re going to do a Miniprep and run an  experiment analogous to what we did on 8/19/2010.
Miniprep of 2 cultures: one inoculated from a fluorescent  colony on the 4º C plate; one inoculated from a fluorescent colony on the 15º  C. 
Protocol from 8/12/2010
Concentrations:
pCOLD+mRFP (4º C)
41.2 ng/uL
pCOLD+mRFP (15º C)
67.1 ng/uL
Transformation of BL21 by pCOLD+mRFP  (from 4C  and 15ºC cultures)
Plasmid, cells should be on ice initially
+ 1uL plasmid into 20 uL of competent cells (BL21)
Sit on ice, 10 mins
place in 42º water bath, 30 seconds
place in ice, 2 minutes
+250 uL LB broth
Plate: spread 100 uL onto plate, use spatula to spread around  until resistance is felt.
I plated an IPTG plate and a non-ITPG plate
The IPTG plate had 25 uL of 0.1 M IPTG
Plates were left (upside down) on bench at room temperature (since  the starter culture is not needed until Sunday, and these cells were  transformed today, Friday)
For Next Time:
Sunday: Start 5 mL culture with one  fluorescent colony of pCOLD+mRFP
Monday: Protein Expression under various  conditions (i.e. cold, iptg, cold+iptg) in 5x50mL flasks.
