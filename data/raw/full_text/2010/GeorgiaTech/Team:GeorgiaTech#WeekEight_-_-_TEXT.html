Plan for this week:
Weekend: PCR purify hybB, run gel for pSB1A3
Mon: Redo PCR RFP; digest RFP (O/N)
Tues: ligate hyB+RFP (O/N), Digest pSB1A3 (O/N)
Wed: PCR ; digest (1hr); PCR purify (digests of hyb+rfp and pSB1a3) at same time we run gel to check results; ligate O/N
Thurs: Tranformation of cells by hyb+RFP+psb1a3
Fri: check plates
 
9/20/2010
Goals:
Redo PCR of mRFP F,R; mRFP F2,R
Digest mRFP F,R; mRFP F2, R O/N (not possible until we get enzymes)
RUN GEL - 2 uL each - to check size - this step completed for all building blocks
PCR PURIFY leftovers - this step completed for all building blocks
NANOSPEC - record concentrations - this step completed for all building blocks
Transform novablue with mRFP that ryan gave us (labeled mRFP H) to create our own crytostock
Notes:
Ryan gave us a fresh stock of mRFP plasmid. We only get this one! It is precious like gold or diamonds!
Since the original mRFP has a Nde I site in the MCS, we are worried other products may run at the same size. To avoid this worry, we will use gel extraction to extract only our band of interest.
mRFP

Use Novablue to create a cryostock. (transform, grow on plate, pick colony, grow in liquid media, take cryostock)

Ligation of RFP-FR to HybB-FR
using hybB from 9/18/2010 and RFP from 9/21/2010
Calculating equivalents:
RFP- [41 ng/uL]/678 bp= 0.06 eq/uL
hyBb-[26 ng/uL]/393 bp = 0.06 eq/uL
for linear ligations, use a 1:1 ratio of products

1 uL 10x Ligase Buffer
4.5 uL H20

Leave RT for 1 hour
 
Start time: 3:20 pm
End time: 4:20 pm

transform into e. coli
 
Notes:

Protocols
 
Running PCR product on gel
The pcr was left overnight at 12 c, and I am running 4 uL on a gel
4  uL sample + 1 uL running dye
 
Notes:
I could not see any stained DNA, even the ladder. This means the EtBr degraded in the gels. Solution, suggested by Richard, is to keep a bottle of 1% Agarose/TBE solution at RT. This solution represents the first step of making a gel. Then whenever we need a gel, we start from the pre-made solution, add Etbr, and procede as normal. Start with fresh gels.
PCR products store in yellow box
Building blocks in blue rack
 
Making gel for PCR
1.  Heat 30 mL of 1% agarose solution  in microwave until agarose dissolves. Allow to cool. Make sure there are NO VAPORS before adding EtBr. EtBr is an intercalator. Don’t vaporize it, especially near your face!
2. Add 35 սL EtBr (edited from 45 uL, make 1000X)
3. Pour gel and allow to harden.
 
Results
Gel from 9.23.2010.
100 bp ladder| RFP-FR +HybB PCR|
Predicted Size- 1070 bp
 
Due to multiple bands, we decided to gel extract the construct RFP+hyBB. To do this, we borrowed a larger Gel try and apparatus from the Hammer Lab (they had a box of things they were not using). The larger gel is approximately 80 ml and is larger in area. The new gel will help make cutting the band easier.
 
Making gel for PCR (Hammer Lab Apparatus)
1.  Heat 90 mL of 1% agarose solution  in microwave until agarose dissolves. Allow to cool. Make sure there are NO VAPORS before adding EtBr. EtBr is an intercalator. Don’t vaporize it, especially near your face!
2. Add 90 սL EtBr (edited from 45 uL, make 1000X)
3. Pour gel and allow to harden.
(I did 100 mL, but found the actual volume to be around 80 to 90 mL)
Start: 4:10 pm
End: 5:10 pm
 
Gel Extraction Protocol
1. Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
3. Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5. Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
6. To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min.
7. Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
8. To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
9. Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
10. Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
11. To elute DNA, added 30  μL water (pH 7.0 – 8.5), let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min.
 
Gel of RFP-FR + HybB FR PCR product (Before Gel Extraction)
30 uL of PCR product|9.5 uL of 100 bp ladder

For Future-
Friday-
nanospec the gel extracted hyb+RFP construct (in blue box)
Run 2 uL on gel, see if 1100 bp is confirmed
if so, continue with strategy.
 
9/24/2010Goals
nanospec the gel extracted hyb+RFP construct (in blue box)
Run 2 uL on gel, see if 1100 bp is confirmed
if so, digest the construct and vector psb1a3 (3 hrs); ligate (1hr), transform (1.5 hours)
 
Protocols
 
1 % Agarose Gel
I found that the small gel trays need only 25-30 mL of solution (less than 30)
I heated 30 mL of 1 % Agarose solution for approximately 45 seconds. I then added 30 uL of EtBr (use blue gloves) and poured into the prepared gel tray (tray inside of assembly, with combs). Cool for 1 hr. The gel will be done when there is a faint blue hue visible when looking at it.
Gel Start: 9:10 am
End 10:10 am

PCR Purfiy the two digests (RFP+Hyb construct, pSB1A3)
Note- We have had the best results when eluting in 30 uL of H20
See Protocols page for PCR Purification
 
Nanospec
pSB1A3 Digest (purified) = 6.2 ng/uL
RFP+HYBB Digest (purified)= 4.4ng/uL
 
Ligation of pSB1A3 to [RFP-FR+ HybB-FR] (from 9.23.2010)
Calculating equivalents:
pSB1A3- [ 6.2 ng/uL]/ 2100 bp=  3x10^-3 eq/uL
hyBb+RFP-[ 4.4 ng/uL]/1100 bp = 4x10^-3  eq/uL
 
 
For plasmid to linear ligations, use a 1:2 ratio of vector:products if the products are purified (1:4 if not)
E.g. 1 equivalent of vector to 2 equivalent of linear product
 
Ligation Protocol:
3 uL of RFP + HYB (~ 2 to 3 uL)
2 uL of  Plasmid pSB1A3 (~ 1/2x amount of linear product on eq/uL basis)
1 uL 10x Ligase Buffer
3.5 uL H20
0.5 uL T4 Ligase (enzyme-- keep in freezer-- add last of all)
 
Total=10 uL
Leave RT for 1 hour
Start: 5:23 pm
 
Transformation
Heat shock transformation of the plasmids into our bacteria
10 սL Nova Blue cells + 5 սL of Ligation Reaction
 
See Protocols page for Heat Shock Transformation
 
Notes for Future-
Aliquots of BL21 and Novablue are in our -70c freezer
Autoclave fresh pipette tips- there is confusion over which tips fit what pipettes- we need to calibrate to make sure our tips and pipettes are giving us the volumes we want
