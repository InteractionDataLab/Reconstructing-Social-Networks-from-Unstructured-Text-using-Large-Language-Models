Team:GeorgiaTech/Sponsors
From 2010.igem.org
Through the generosity of the sponsors below, the Georgia Tech iGEM team has the means to investigate the limitless possibilities of synthetic biology! If you are interested in helping support us please scroll down to find out more about who we are and what we do.
Project Goals
Our project goal is to successfully engineer thermo-generating AOX  genes from the sacred lotus plant (Nelumbo nucifera) into Eschericha coli in order to produce heat producing E. coli  that can be used for a number of applications for which maintenance of a temperature above freezing is crucial.

Team Goals
Our team is Georgia Tech’s first ever iGEM team, and thus one of our goals is to establish a firm foundation for future Tech teams. In this first year, we are striving to produce a successful and presentable project for the iGEM Jamboree this November, while gaining an increasing knowledge in genetic engineering and building strong relationships within the team. Our team members are looking forward to sharing their findings and with other members of the iGEM community!

What is iGEM?
iGEM stands for“International Genetically Engineered Machine.” The iGEM competition is an annual synthetic biology contest among undergraduates worldwide.  Each team must devise its own project and produce a new biological system, using a provided kit of biological parts and/or parts designed by the team. While all of the teams are competing, the true essence of the competition is to create new methods and systems to increase knowledge in the emerging field of synthetic biology.
The iGEM competition was started in 2004 and included 5 teams. Since then, more teams have joined every year to compete at the annual iGEM Jamboree held at MIT every November.  This year, the competition has grown to about 180 teams, and the Georgia Tech team is excited for becoming a competitor in this prestigious competition!
