Reactions I am purifying:
RFP-F2R (NdeI, SpeI)
OmpA FR (NotI, XmaI)
Aox1a-FR (Xma, SpeI)
Aox1a-FR2 (Xma, NdeI)

OmpA FR (NotI, XmaI)= 15 ng/uL
Aox1a-FR (Xma, SpeI)= 12 ng/uL
Aox1a-FR2 (Xma, NdeI)= 25 ng/uL
Aox1b-FR (Xma, SpeI)= 23 ng/uL
Aox1b-FR2 (Xma, NdeI)= 21.3 ng/uL
 
Ligations
hyb= [26.2 ng/ul ]/ 393 bp = 0.067 eq/uL
ompa = [15 ng/uL]/81 bp = 0.185 eq/uL
 
Ligation of HyBb+ Ompa
5.7 uL H20
2 uL of HybB
0.8  uL of Ompa
1 uL 10x Ligase Buffer
0.5 uL T4 Ligase (enzyme-- keep in freezer-- add last of all)
Total 10 uL
RT for 1 hr. - Start time: 11:25 am
 
Aliquot T4 Buffer:
Make aliquots (5 uL) of the T4 Ligase Buffer so as to not continuously repeat freeze-thaw cycles.
USE FROM ALIQUOTS FROM NOW ON - NOT THE GREEN-CAPPED EPPENDORF.
 
Miniprep of pSB1A3+hybB+ompA
1. Remove inoculation tubes from inoculation (37C shaker).
2. Obtain P1 buffer from 4C refrigerator.
3. Take centrifuge tubes and add 1.5mL of inoculated cells.
4. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm (low) for 1-2 min.
5. Spin until white pellet of cells forms at the bottom and liquid is more clear.
6. Take off supernatant and discard.
7. Repeat steps 4-6.
8. Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250սL P1 buffer.
9.  Add 250սL P2 buffer and invert 4-6 times (DO NOT VORTEX - doing so will shear DNA!)
10. Add 350սL buffer N3 and immediately invert 4-6 times.
11. Centrifuge for 10 min. at 13,000 rpm.
12. Take supernatant and add to spin columns.

18. Let stand for 1 min., then centrifuge for 1 min.
 
Making a 1 % gel
25*4=100 mL
We found that we had extra left over.
Start at 1:13 pm
End: 2:13 pm
 
PCR of Hyb+OmpA ligation
3 uL of product of ligation reaction
25.5 uL H2O
10 uL PHUSION 5X Reaction buffer
5 uL HybB-F forward primer
5 uL OmpA-R reverse primer
1 uL dNTP 10 mM - (thawed & kept on ice)
0.5 uL polymerase enzyme, PHUSION
Total Volume= 50 uL
Start: 12:57 pm
End: 3:00 pm (approx)
 
Plan:
Once PCR is finished, run 4 uL of the reaction on the gel. Check for a band running at a size of 393+81=474 bp, so approximately mid 400-500 bp. If band is observed, prepare for the digest (check for the RE sites based on what primers were used).
 
Gel Picture
insert gel pic from computer
band around 500 bp.

BASIC PLAN FOR BUILDING PLASMID CONSTRUCTS
from the primered building blocks, which are stored in our freezer
A) RUN GEL - 2 uL each - to check size - this step completed for all building blocks
B) PCR PURIFY leftovers - this step completed for all building blocks
C) NANOSPEC - record concentrations - this step completed for all building blocks
D) DIGEST with restriction enzymes, overnight
E) PCR PURIFY digestion products
F) LIGATION of gene building blocks - we are starting with HybB & RFP
G) PCR ligation products, HybB-RFP
H) DIGEST products, HybB-RFP
I) RUN GEL on small amount of digestion products, HybB-RFP
J) PCR PURIFY the rest of the digestion products, HybB-RFP
K) DIGEST the vector - we are using pBS1A3
L) PCR PURIFY the vector
M) LIGATION of gene with vector, HybB-RFP and pBS1A3
N) TRANSFORMATION of plasmid into E. coli, run overnight
Note- Do a nanospec after PCR purifications
 
NOTES:
Steps in BOLD are going to be repeated with each plasmid construct. Steps A,B, and C have already been done for each building block and won’t be repeated unless there is a specific issue with a particular building block.
Steps K and L do not necessarily need to wait until step J is completed to be run. They are listed this way so there is no confusion about what is being digested or PCR purified at each step.
 
 
9/28/2010
Results from 9/27/2010:
The gel picture of the hybB+ompa is in the folder.
The band is bright at 500 bp, and our predictions confirm the results.
Nanospec results - 326.6 ng/uL
Goals for 9/28/10: PCR purify the PCR (in the yellow box)
 
Experimental Procedures:
1. Make cryostocks of mRFP:NB cells from starter cultures made on 9/27/2010.  900uL cells+100uL DMSO. Stored in -80C fridge in Gaucher Lab (iGEM box).
 
Notes
Christina+Rob PCR purified the hyb+ompa PCR.
Richard suggested we can PCR Aox+RFP, then pcr that to the hyb+ompa. This wil take care of two constructs. The other two require Aox a/b to be attached to the hybb+ompa construct
For the constructs that have Aox+RFP, we can do a ligation of Aox to RFP; then, PCR that part and ligate it to the Hyb+ompa.
For the AOX-RFP constructs:
Ligate Aox1a-FR2 to RFP-F2R
LigateAox1b-FR2 to RFP-F2R
PCR each ligation reaction
PCR purify
Check results on gel
Gel extract if PCR results in multiple bands
Digest the Aox-RFP construct
PCR purify
Ligate the Aox-RFP digests to Hyb-Ompa digest
PCR the entire constructs
For the HybB-Ompa-Aox constructs:
Ligate the HybB-Ompa to Aox1a-FR or Aox1b-FR
PCR the constructs
PCR Purify
Check results on gel
if multiple bands, gel extract
Ligate Hyb-Ompa-Aox to pSB1A3
Transform into cells or PCR entire vector

Check results on gel (40 mins max)
Gel extract if PCR results in multiple bands (1hr)
Digest the Aox-RFP construct (3 hours or overnight)

PCR ended at 3- Scott and Christina will grab them.
The tube labels could not be read! The tubes were crushed- I have had this happen to me as well. Slight pressure is sufficient. I don’t know which one is aox1a+rfp or aox1b+rfp. I assume the one that looked like “b” is aox1b. PCRS are the in yellow box- I put pcrs in there usually.  Note: (@Scott - I (Christina)  looked again at the tubes and I think they were labelled “1” and “2” - I in front of the ones you put in the yellow box to verify)
 
Heat shock transformation of the plasmids into our bacteria
10 սL BL21 cells + 5 սL of plasmid
 
See Protocols page for Heat Shock Transformation
 
Picked colonies from plates of HybB+RFP and added to 25 ul of water each. Used 5 ul for PCR, and added 250 ul of LB media to the rest. These tubes are in a  green holder in the 37 degrees incubator.

9/30/2010
Goals
Check results form 9.29.2010
Richard/Megan suggested we can do a double ligation for:
[HybB.OmPa.AOX1a-FR.]+[pSB1A3]
[HybB.OmPa.AOX1b-FR].+[pSB1A3]
Similarly, we can do a triple ligation of:
[Hyb.Ompa]+[Aox1a-FR2.RFP]+[pSB1A3]
[Hyb.Ompa]+[Aox1b-FR2.RFP]+[pSB1A3]
 
 
Results from 9/29/2010
Plates from 9/29/2010 of the hyb+rfp construct have many red colonies. Each colony has a red center and brownish outer ring surrounding that center.
I put the plates in the refrigerator.

Results
The pcrs of Aoxa/b+RFP do not appear clean. The predicted 1700 bp is very faint.   We need to troubleshoot!
Successful tubes (All except 7 + 10) placed in 37C shaker in Gauche lab at 3:00pm
 
Protocols
Ask Richard/Megan volume for triple ligation. Do we need to check concentration of ligations?
I have laid out the proposed  double ligation recipes, but check with Richard/Megan. I predict the triple ligations are similar except less water will be used .
What is our plan- do digests from the ligations, or PCR them up and then digest?

Notes:
Troubleshooting the
[HybB.OmPa.AOX1a-FR] and [HybB.OmPa.AOX1b-FR] :
make sure elongation time is 2 minutes
make thermocycler compatible with lowest melting temp of primers
troubleshoot pcr by making shorter pcr products, like ompa+aox or hyb+ompa, to make sure template is there
Or just not do PCR and do a triple ligation

Gel (Version 2) (Same as Version 1)
For Mitesh, Margo: I ran wrong PCR- Run on gel the PCR labeled from 9.30.2010 as “Repeat” with Christian’s name on it.
Gel extraction has two bands- one is the 1700 one we want, the other isn’t. We need to plan how get the 1700 one; perhaps another gel extract?
We need annotated sequence files-Richard has some starting ones.
We need to design sequencing primers for all the parts once they are in pSB1A3
Debika- Start starter cultures of colonies 9,10, 5 ,6 of hyb+RFP

Suggestions
Dr.  Gaucher suggested doing a PCR purification of the Ligation reactions, since PCR is sensitive to salts and buffers.
Also a gradient would be useful.
Try increasign annealing temp to 56 or so, 52 is too low he said!
 
Triple Ligation
richard suggested triple ligation, screen with 20 colonies

For Tomorrow
(Check to make sure the proposed actions for tomorrow make sense!)
Troubleshooting the PCR of hyb.ompa.aox
run the troubleshooting PCRs Margo did today on a gel to check results
Prepare the reactions needed to make hyb.ompa+aox+psb1a3 using a triple ligation
Digest the Pcr of hyb.ompa from
Ligate hyb.ompa+aox+psb1a3
Order primers!

Goals
If Gaucher lab is open, run results on gel and visualize
Else, start Triple ligation
Do we start from the digested products we have or start from scratch?
Problem: we didn’t transform the triple ligation (hyb.ompa+aox+psb1a4) from 9.30.2010 that Gita did! We can transform that today and start a new triple ligation, and make sure to transform that tomorrow
Make cryo stocks of starter cultures
 
 
Protocols:
 
Heat shock transformation of the NB with triple ligations (hyb.ompa+aox_psb1a3) (Scott)
1. hyb.ompa+aox1a-FR+psb1a3
2. hyb.ompa+aoox1b-FR+psb1a3
 
10 սL Nova Blue cells + 5 սL of Ligation Reaction (hyb.ompa+aox+psb1a3) from 9.30.2010 that Gita did

Repeat of Triple Ligations (hyb.ompa +aox+psb1a3)
Triple Ligation of AOX1a-FR to HybB.Ompa and psb1a3 (Margo)
using AOX1a-FR from 9/17/2010 [Edit 9.29.2010 is this from 17th or 27th?] and HybB.Ompa from 9/29/2010
Calculating equivalents:
HybB.Ompa- [ 4.1 ng/uL]/474 bp= 0.009 eq/uL
AOX1a-FR -[ 25 ng/uL]/1035 bp = 0.0241 eq/uL
pSB1A3- [6ng/uL]/2056bp=0.003 eq/uL
for linear ligations, use a 2:2:1 ratio of products:product:vector
Ligation:

See Protocols page for Heat Shock Transformation
 
For Tomorrow
Run on a gel
aoxa, aoxb next to the troubleshooting pcrs from today, specifically of the PCRS using Ompa-F and Aoxa/b-R since they are similar sizes
Take out plates from incubator. Record observations
Run colony PCRs on at least 20 colonies per construct (yes 20)
Check which primers to use for colony pcr! We can likely use the primers we already have
Run results on gel
