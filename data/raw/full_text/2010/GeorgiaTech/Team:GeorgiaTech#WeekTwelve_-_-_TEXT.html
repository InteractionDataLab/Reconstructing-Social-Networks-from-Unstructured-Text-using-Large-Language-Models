Miniprep of psb1C3(Scott) (done)
See Protocols page for Plasmid DNA Purification with Mini Prep Kit
 
Prepare DNA to send off for sequencing.( Christina)(Scott)
 
In standard PCR tubes, prepare template DNA with just water and ONE primer (forward or reverse). The total volume should be 15 uL. The concentration of DNA in the sample should be adjusted to match the length of the template DNA; there is a chart in the Gaucher lab on the wall above the EtBr disposal bucket. For example, for a PCR product 1000 to 2000 bp in length, the concentration of the sample should be ~ 4 ng/uL.
Predicted size of hybB-ompA-aox1a: 1509 bp. Calculate concentration to be ~ 4 ng/uL
 
An email should be sent to Ryan with the following information:
Tube Label: actually written on the tube, in this form: RR01, RR02, etc.
DNA Name: this is something meaningful to us, like AOXa_construct_PSB1A3_vector_1
DNA Type: Purified PCR or Plasmid
DNA length: in bp
My primer: a name meaningful to us
Give the tubes to Ryan. Apparently they should not be frozen, just kept on ice.

run digests from yesterday on gel - done (Christian, Margo)
make lb+carb plates - done (Margo, Scott)
using the transformations of the aoxa/b and rfp-f3r colonies as templates, resmear additional plates so that we can have distinct colonies as opposed to the lawns we have now - done (Margo)
 
Protocols
 
Making LB media (Margo, Scott)
To make 0.75 L LB (Lysogeny broth) medium:
3.75 g Yeast extract
7.5g Tryptone
3.75g NaCl
 
To make solid plates, follow the above recipe and add 16g agar per 1L  (12 for .75 l)
 
Prepared 800 mL of LB media (50 ml extra)
750 ml for plates and 250ml liquid
Autoclave, leaving lids slightly loosened.
Let cool in water bath at 55C. (started 12 pm)
Add antibiotic (800uL carbenicillin) to 800 mL LB media used for plates.
For the agar plates, pipetted 25mL into each plate, allow to hardened on benchtop. Refrigerated and ready to go..
 
Note for others:
For resmearing the plates of the transformation done 10.21.2010 (aox 3, 5a, 6a, aox b15 and b18, rfp f3 1, 11, 12, 19). Make sure to save ALL plates when done and put the ones from 10.21.2010 back into the 4c fridge! We are tracking the progress of red colonies on the rfp-f3 paltes

Made liquid cultures of colonies of hyBb-RFP-psB1a3 in BL21. I picked 6 colonies from plate 1. #6 was already red by the time I started the culture, the rest were pinkish. I also picked 7 colonies from plate 2. #12 and #13 were already red, and the rest were pinkish by the time I started the culture.
The 13 tubes are in the 37 degrees incubator/ shaker in the other room.  
 
How to prepares samples for microscopy  (Look at table below)
1. In cold, growing for a couple of days.
Get a fresh plate...liquid of streaking of a colony.
2 or several plates for cold temperature. 1 will be left at cold until the last minute. the other one should be moved to warm a couple hours before we go to the scope.
 
2 other plates... put them in 37 and grow them overnight... (saturday night let them grow), sunday transfer them to the cold, one of these will stay in the cold until the last minute, and one will be moved to warm a couple hours before we image.
 
another plate... at 37 the whole time.. never goes to cold. - do this on sunday preferably.
 
Once we have new plates that have been streaked with colonies from liquid culture on Saturday night, prepare the following samples: (I explaine this to Scott. If he’s not here, call him or me!)

Digest of colony A5 of hyb.ompa.aoxA.psb1a3 (from 10.22.2010)(Margo)
colony 5, Aox1a colony PCR from 10-22 (117 ng/ul)
4.5  uL H20
2uL 10X EcoRI buffer
10 uL hyb.ompa.aoxa.psb1a3 colony 5 miniprep (10.22.2010)
2 uL BSA (1ug/uL, to a final conc of .1mg/ml)
0.75 uL SpeI
0.75 uL EcoRI
Total=20 ul total
 
Note: we need SpeI or a equivalent enzyme with same cutting site and overhang! We couldn’t start the digest today!
 
observations
on the hyb-rfp plates from 10.22, we saw some colonies that were slightly pink that were not pink yesterday; they are circled and dated with today’s date.
