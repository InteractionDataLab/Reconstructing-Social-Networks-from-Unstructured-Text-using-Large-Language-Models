Inoculation of cell cultures 5, 8 and 9
1. In a Eppendorf tube add 3սL carbinicillin  (CARB) to 3 mL LB media.
2. Inoculate at 37C overnight.
 
8/17/2010
Cell culture tubes 5, 8, and 9 from 8/16/2010  were removed from inoculation and used for two purposes:
Freezing a portion of inoculated cells for future  use
300 սL of glycerol were added to 200 սL of each  culture and tapped gently until the culture had mixed with the glycerol. These  were then marked and stored in the freezer in the upstairs lab.
Addition of IPTG to induce expression of pCOLD
To test the effects of IPTG on mRFP (and thus  pCOLD) expression, we prepared 4 concentrations of IPTG for each of the 3 tubes  of bacteria (5, 8, and 9), resulting in 12 tubes.
Each contained:
930սL LB media
50սL culture
10սL CARB
10սL IPTG
where the 10սL of IPTG were calculated serial  dilutions insured to give an overall IPTG concentration of 0.1 M (10^-3), 1 mM  (10^-5), 10 սM (10^-7), and 100 nM (10^-9) for each tube number 5, 8, and 9.  The resulting 12 samples were put in the incubator at 37C overnight.
If everything goes according to plan, it should  be possible to see some RFP expression tomorrow.
8/18/2010
Expression of mRFP should have been detectable by  red coloring in the samples after incubation.   Nothing was seen, and as such the samples were discarded. WE PUT THEM IN  THE WRONG CELLS! Novablue cells are inapropriate for this type of  transformation... redo the transformation with BL21 cells.
8/19/2010
Transformation into BL21 cells
Adding IPTG to plates:
1.  Spread  50սL IPTG on 2 LB/carb plates (50սL each plate).
2. Wait 1 hour to allow IPTG to soak into media.
Preparing cells:
3. Chill 2 empty 1.5սL Eppendorf tubes, 1:4  ligation reaction product, and 20սL BL21 cells on ice.
4. Aliquot 10սL of BL21 cells into Eppendorf  tubes (10սL each tube).
5. In each tube add 1սL 1:4 ligation reaction  mixture.
6. Allow to sit on ice for 10-30 min.
7.  Place  in 42C bath for 30-45 sec.
8. Immediately place back on ice for 2 min.
9. Add 250սL room temp. LB media to reaction  tube.
10.  Places  tubes in 37C incubator/shaker for 1 hr.
11. Spread 125սL of incubated cells onto labelled  LB/CARB plates according to below:
Plate
IPTG
CELLS
TEMP
1
50սL
125սL
4C
2
50սL
125սL
15C
3

4

12. Incubate overnight (16 hrs) at 37C.
8/20/2010
Cold shock:
1. Place places in appropriate temperature  incubators (4C or 15C), and wait to see expression of RFP.
Results: One red colony observed on IPTG plate at  4C at 9:20 am.
