10/25/2010
 
Goals
image hyb.ompa.rfp-f3r colony R11 plates to check for periplasmic expression (COMPLETED!)
obtain SpeI from Hammer Lab (COMPLETED)
digest A5 miniprep (10.23, in yellow rack) with EcoRI and SpeI (COMPLETED)
make more gels
this afternoon, gel extract the 1.5 kb isnert from A5 on a gel
upload pictures from periplasmic expression to iGEM NB - send out an e-mail to all team members if possible to show these so that we can use the images for slides and poster.

Gel for gel extraction
order: gene exact ladder|digested psb1c3|digested A5 (10.23)|ladder|empty|digested psb1c3|digested A5 (from 10.23)

(before gel extraction)
 
After gel extraction
 
Notes: the predicted 1.5 kb band was excised from the colony A5 hyb.ompa.aoxa digest, but the digest of the vector did not yield the predicted 2 kb backbone.
Need to report the digest of psb1c3 with EcoRI and SpeI
 
hyb.ompa.aoxa A5 SpeI and EcoRI digest (2 kb band) gel extraction (Scott,Debika)
1. Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
        Weight= 190 mg
3. Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5. Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
6. Placed a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
7. To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
8. Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9 To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000.
10. Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
11. Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
12. To elute DNA, added 30  μL water (pH 7.0 – 8.5), let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.

psb1c3 (miniprep from 10.19.2010) SpeI and EcoRI digest (2 kb band) gel extraction (Repetition of the digest) (Christina, Scott)
1. Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
        Weight= 290 mg
3. Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5. Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
6. Placed a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
7. To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
8. Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9. Recommended: Added 0.5 mL of Buffer GQ to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
10. To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000.
11. Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
12. Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
13. To elute DNA, added 30  μL water (pH 7.0 – 8.5), let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
