Psb1a3 SpeI and EcoRI digest (2 kb band) gel extraction (Scott, Debika)
|1kb ladder|4ul of psb1a3 SpeI+EcoRI Digest| 21 uL of psb1a3 SpeI+EcoRI Digest|
 
1. Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
3. Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
5. Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
6. Placed a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
7. To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
8. Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9. Recommended: Added 0.5 mL of Buffer GQ to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
10. To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000.
11. Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
12. Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
13. To elute DNA, added 30  μL water (pH 7.0 – 8.5), let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
 
(Scott and Christina will do this)
Digest of psb1a7 directly from the well aliquot
7.5 uL H20 -
2 uL 10X ECORI Buffer -
5 uL pSB1A7 (10.11.2010, 107.5 ng/uL)(well aliquot of psb1a7) -
5 uL BSA (1ug/uL, to a final conc of .1mg/ml) - (*note - should have been 3uL)
0.75 uL SpeI -
0.75 uL EcoRI -
Total=22 ul total
Overnight 37C waterbath
 
Notes:
I propose we gel extract the linearized band by loading all the digest (from 10/9/2010) onto a larger well and cutting the 2kb band out (the middle band if you are looking at the gel picture, in the 3rd well from the left)- Debika and Scott (done)
We also need more 100bp ladder.
Ask Gaucher lab if they have chloramphenicol since psb1c3 needs it - (Done, in frig)
Ask gaucher lab for list of plasmid list -Christina (done)
Colony PCR the previous hyb.ompa.aox, but only the white colonies - Christian and Margo (done)
Order primers that igem suggest for checking our vectors, named VR and VF2 (check to make sure psb1c3, psb1a3, and psb1a7 use these primers)
psb1c3-VF2, VR
psb1a3-VF2, VR
psb1a7-VF2, VR
VF2
5’ tgccacctgacgtctaagaa 3’
check tm, since it is 50 and we may have to increase it
VR

For Tomorrow (10/12/10)
Gel extraction of digested psb1a7 (Someone who has done gel extracts before should do this- we dont have anymore of this left, and Dr. Gaucher wants us to be super careful!)(remember to do it the Gaucher lab way- load ~4 ul in one well, then the rest in another, and only image the 4ul well) (COMPLETE - FAILED) -- we have about 2/3 uL of digested psb1A7 left over.
triple ligation of digested, gel extracted psb1a3 backbone to hyb.ompa and aox a/b
hyb.ompa+aoxa+psb1a3 (COMPLETE)
hyb.ompa+aoxb+psb1a3 (COMPLETE)
Transformation of above mentioned triple ligation into NB cells.
If any gel extracted psb1a3 is left over after triple ligations, load 4 uL on a gel to confirm that gel extraction worked (COMPLETE)
Check colony pcr results from yesterday on a gel (CPMPLETE)
Figure out alternative vectors from the Gaucher lab/ biobricks. pET-15b frp, from gaucher lab doesn’t have speI site, so it won’t work for the hyb.omp.aox construct.  
 
10/12/10
 
Gel extraction of psb1A7
Done according to protocol, with the aim of extracting psb1A7.  Bad results probably a combination of things: bad/old gel (ladder barely visible), etc. We have about 2/3 uL of digested psb1A7 left over for possible pcr, etc.
Results: No DNA observed or extracted
 
Triple ligation of digested, gel extracted psb1a3 backbone to hyb.ompa and aox a/b
hyb.ompa+aoxa+psb1a3 (see below for protocol)
hyb.ompa+aoxb+psb1a3 (see below for protocol)
 
Triple ligation of AOX1, HybB, and plasmid constructs

AOX1a-FR-[12 ng/uL]/1035 bp = 0.0116 eq/uL
AOX1b-FR-[23 ng/uL]/1035 bp = 0.0222 eq/uL
for linear ligations, use a 1:1 ratio of products

RFP-F3R= [17.50.  ng/uL0.025
psb1a3=[11.6 ng/uL]/2000 bp =0.0058
for linear ligations, use a 2:2:1 ratio of products:product:vector
Protocol:
1 uL of RFP-F3R
2.6 uL of HybB-OmpA
2 uL of psb1A3
1 uL 10x Ligase Buffer
2.9 uL H20

Total= uL
Started 4: pm
 
Check colony pcr results from 10/11/10 on a gel:
pictures from colony PCR strips 1 and 2 (10/11/10) are in the igem gel pics notebook dated 10/12/10 1 and 2, A-H.
picture from colony PCR strip 3  (A-H) (10/11/10) are below. The last two lanes on the second gel are digested psb1a3, faint bands, but clearly present... the gel on the right is old (and also 1.5%).

do 10 colonies from aoxB plate
 
If time alots, make chloramphenicol plates ( http://www.k-state.edu/hermanlab/protocols/AntibioticUsage.html )
ours is 1000 x, so use 1uL per 1mL of LB

Making LB media
To make 1L LB (Lysogeny broth) medium:
5g Yeast abstract
10g Tryptone
5g NaCl
 
To make solid plates, follow the above recipe and add 16g agar per 1L.
 
Prepared 1L of LB media
.75L liquid broth and .25L to make plates.
Add 4g agar to plate broth (250mL).

Psb1a3 SpeI and EcoRI digest (2 kb band) gel extraction(Debika)
|1kb ladder|4ul of psb1a3 SpeI+EcoRI Digest| 21 uL of psb1a3 SpeI+EcoRI Digest|
 
1. Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
top band: .25g = 250mg (add 750 uL buffer QG)
labelled “top” psb1a3
bottom band: .18 g = 180mg (add 540 uL buffer QG)
labelled “bottom”psb1a3
3. Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If not, add 10 uLsodium acetate (5.5 pH, 3M).
added 10uL sodium acetate (5.5 pH, 3M) to psb1a3 “bottom”
5. Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
add 250 uL isopropanol to “top”
add 180 uL isopropanol to “bottom”
6. Placed a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
7. To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000rmp.
8. Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
9. Recommended: Added 0.5 mL of Buffer GQ to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
10. To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min @13,000.
11. Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
12. Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
13. To elute DNA, added 30  μL water (pH 7.0 – 8.5), let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min @13,000k.
top band nanospec concentration 9.4 ng/uL
labelled “T, 10-15, top band”
bottom band nanospec concentration 9.5 ng/uL
labelled “B, 10-15, bottom band”
        both tubes are in the yellow box in the freezer. there’s a big “T” and “B” on top of the tubes.

Goals
look at gel pictures for aoxa 1-10, aoxb 1-10, rfp-F3r 1-10 and see pick appropriate colonies
note this has been done for colony 10 of aoxa and 1-3 of aoxb, but look at the gel pic of aoxb run again on 10.15.2010.
check the minipreps from 10.15.2010 via digests
redigest the aoxa/b we have now
if needed, start pcrs for new aoxa,b, rfp-F3R
Transform psb1c3 plasmids on chloamphenicol plates (done)
check registry to see if insert is rfp coding or toxic gene  (rfp)
overnight digest of purified, digested aoxa-FR and aoxb-FR from (9.23 and 9.27)
digests of minipreps of colony 10 of aoxa and 1-3 of aoxb, (in heat block, 2pm 10.16)
digest the predicted insert out
EcoRI and SpeI
glycerol stocks of the colony pcrs of interest (done)

Observations of gel pics
gel pic from 10.15.2010 of hyb.ompa.aoxb.psb1a3
colony 5 appears to have the predicted 500 bp band
colonies 1,  3 6, 8, 9 have a 500 bp band along with 700 bp band
Suggestion: grow up colony 5 and perhaps 2 of the other colonies
gel pic from 10.14.2010 of hyb.ompa.aoxa.psb1a3
The colonies did not exclusively have the predicted 500 bp band, but a few had the band along with a mix of bands. In particular, colony 10 was picked and miniprepped yesterday.
