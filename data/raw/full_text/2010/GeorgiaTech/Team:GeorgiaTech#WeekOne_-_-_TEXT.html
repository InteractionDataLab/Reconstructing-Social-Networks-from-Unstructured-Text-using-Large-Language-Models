8/5/2010
Extracting pCOLD from cells
Re-suspended pellet in 250 սL PI buffer
Added 250 սL P2, inverted about 5 times
Added 350 սL N3, mix immediately, inverted 4-6 times
Centrifuged 10 min, 13k RPM
Enzyme digest
Poured supernatant into spin column
Centrifuged 30-60 seconds and discarded flow-through
Washed column with 750 սL PE and centrifuged 30-60 seconds
Discarded flowthrough, centrifuged 1 min
Eluted by placing column in new 1.5 mL tube, added 30 սL EB. Let stand 5 min.
Centrifuged 5 minutes, 5k RPM
8/6/2010
Prepared 1% agarose gels:
Added 180 mL 1x TBE and 1.8g agarose
Heated up until agarose was no longer visible
Let cool (approx. 10 min)
Added 180 սL Ethidium bromide (1000X)
PCR purifcation of the cell cultures from 8/5/2010
Added 5 volumes of Buffer PBI to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix. It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene.
Checked that the color of the mixture was yellow (similar to Buffer PBI without the PCR sample).
Placed a spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
To bind DNA, applied the sample to the column and centrifuge at 17,900g for 30 – 60 secs.
Discarded flow-through. Placed the column back in the same tube.
To wash, added 0.75 mL Buffer PE to the column and centrifuged for 30 – 60 secs.
Discarded flow-through and place the column back in the same tube. Centrifuged the column for an additional 1 min.
Placed the column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, added 50 µL Buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0 – 8.5) to the center of the membrane and centrifuged the column for 1 min. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, added 30  µL elution buffer to the center of the membrane, let the column sit for 1 min, and then centrifuged.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Gel Extraction Protocol
Excised DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weighed the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg or approximately 100 μL).
Incubated at 50ºC for 10 min (or until the gel slice had completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mixed by vortexing the tube every 2 – 3 min during the incubation.
After the gel slice has completely dissolved, checked that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose).
Added 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mixed.
Placed a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 mL collection tube.
To bind DNA, applied the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuged for 1 min.
Discarded flow-through and placed QIAquick column back in the same collection tube.
Recommended: Added 0.5 mL of Buffer GQ to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
To wash, added 0.75 mL of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuged for 1 min.
Discarded the flow-through and centrifuged the QIAquick column for an additional 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
Placeed QIAQuick column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, added 50  μL of Buffer EB (1 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0 – 8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuged the column for 1 min. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, added 30  μL elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuged for 1 min.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
