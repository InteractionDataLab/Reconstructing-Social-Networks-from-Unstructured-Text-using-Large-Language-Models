WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
In 2005, the UT Austin team worked on a light-dependent bacterial printer.

Phage
WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
The following teams have used some component of our phage system previously.  No other teams have used our method of polyphage with incorporated leucine zippers for polymerization (nor is it present in the literature).
In 2006 the McGill team attempted to use leucine zippers fused to split YFP to display on cells and cause the cells to adhere via the split YFP.
The 2009 Freiburg Bioware team used Fos/Jun for a 'programmable enzyme' using Fok-fused Fos/Jun as factor in DNA cleavage.
The 2009 Paris team attempted to use Jun/Fos as a snare; Jun on signal vesicle, Fos on membrane of receiving cell.
This year, Duke's team is using Jun- and Fos-based synthetic leucine zippers for genetic regulation.

Mammalian
WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
To our knowledge, no other iGEM team has worked with isolating mechanosensitive promoters and directed osteogenesis.
