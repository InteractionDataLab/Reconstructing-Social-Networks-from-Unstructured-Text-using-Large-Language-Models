MIT iGEM 2010 Team
The 2010 MIT iGEM Team is a group of motivated undergraduates from all fields of science and engineering led by dedicated and enthusiastic PhD Students from labs all across campus. As a team we have had a blast working together all summer and we are so excited to present all of our work at the Jamboree!! (We're practically jumping for joy.)
