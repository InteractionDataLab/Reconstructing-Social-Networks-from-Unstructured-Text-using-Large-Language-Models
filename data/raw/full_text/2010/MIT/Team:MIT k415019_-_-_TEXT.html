K415019
From the 2010 MIT iGEM Team . See the Parts Registry Page!! →
This BioBrick is composed of parts BBa_R0065 and BBa_C0261, and produces C6O3HSL when activated by a LuxR-C6O3HSL complex. Thus, this BioBrick works as an amplifier in response to an initial C603HSL stimulus, assuming LuxR is present in the system.
