Experimental
The original pTSMa plasmid from the Collins paper. This plasmid has been modified so that it now contains cI that is hypersensitive to cleavage by RecA = Low Power Toggle.

The Collins/Kobayashi UV Toggle (2004) biobricked. It is a bistable toggle (on or off state) and switching to state 1 is induced by UV exposure and to state 2 is IPTG. If the toggle is set with IPTG, the cells will express cI which will inhibit Plambda. If this is exposed to certain levels of UV (see power modulations) cI is cleaved by Rec-A (a UV induced enzyme) and lacI expression begins and inhibits Ptrc.
This part has since been improved by the 2010 MIT iGEM Team . The new, low power toggle pLPTa (or K415301) requires less UV power to switch states, and thus more cells survive the exposure process.  The following data was taken from cells co-transformed with pTSMa and K415023 .
UV Power Modulation
This data was taken from cells co-transformed with K415023 and the original toggle K415300 . The cells were grown to mid-log phase in LB broth and 2.65μM IPTG. The IPTG was washed out, the cells concentrated 10x, and then 100uL cells were added 1:40 to melted M9 Agar and allowed to cool in small petri dishes. The plates incubated agar up for 4 hours at 37°C, were exposed under a mask to the corresponding UV power levels, incubated for another 4 hours at 30°C and then imaged.
The numbers below the images indicate the UV power level to which the cells were exposed.

This data was taken from cells co-transformed with K415023 and the original toggle K415300 . The cells were grown to mid-log phase in LB broth and 2.65μM IPTG. The IPTG was washed out, and the cells were diluted 2x in LB. 2 mL of this dilution were poured into small petri dishes and exposed with no mask at the corresponding UV power level, put into 14mL Falcon tubes and grown up for another 4 hours. Cells from each sample were added to separate tubes of 1mL PBS and FACS'd.
The numbers below the images indicate the UV power level to which the cells were exposed. In each image, the x-axis is the green fluorescence measurement from our part K415023 and the y-axis is the red fluorescence induced by UV exposure from the same part. We had hypothesized that the greater the UV exposure, the greater the red fluorescence (until saturation).
