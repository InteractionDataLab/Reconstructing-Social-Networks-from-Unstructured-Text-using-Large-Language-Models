bacterial methods
The Bacterial team focused on implementing and improving the Collins toggle. The ultimate goal is to connect our toggle to our phage module, so that exposing UV light in a pattern on a lawn of bacteria will result in phage production and polymerization in the exposed area. As an intermediate in our project, we have managed to create what is essentially an improved bacterial camera capable of instantaneous photography.
We implemented part of the Collins toggle in our bacteria, improving upon previous iGEM bacterial cameras by shortening the exposure time from hours (UT-Austin 2005) to seconds. During our experiments, noticeable cell death in UV-exposed regions prompted development of an additional feature. Our bacterial circuit improves upon the Collins toggle in that the power of UV light required to switch the toggle is reduced, resulting in significantly more cells surviving the image capture process.
