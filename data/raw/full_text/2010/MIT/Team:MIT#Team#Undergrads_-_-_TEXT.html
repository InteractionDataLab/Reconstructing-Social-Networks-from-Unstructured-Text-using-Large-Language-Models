MIT iGEM 2010
The 2010 MIT iGEM team. We are biological engineers, physicists, electrical engineers, chemical engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists.
Programmable, Self-constructing Biomaterials
The 2010 MIT iGEM team focused on the control and production of self-constructing and self-repairing living biomaterials through both bacterial and mammalian engineering. We ventured to set up the framework for material formation in both types of cells, for future applications in living, self-repairing materials and in vitro organogenesis respectively.
We have accomplished far beyond what we expected of ourselves! In addition to our project, we have created a new Mammalian Biobrick standard, contributed original parts for mammalian cells and bacteriophage, and we have biobricked two working toggles for the registry.

This is Andrew. He's pretty much a
baller
joke. Nah, just messin'. Andrew, better known to the team as Andre, has an intense bromance with another team member, Paul Muir.
This is Arvind. He's our secret weapon!
This is Crystal. She is a rising junior in Course 10 who is interested in nitric oxide!
This is Grant :cough: ...I mean, Abdul. As you can tell, he's a pretty scary guy. Fun fact: Toward the middle of the summer, Grant started literally living in the lab.
This is Jstev. He's a rising senior from... wait for it... the University of Kansas! But we consider him to be an honorary MIT baller. Jstev gets paid more than we do and also has free housing. :( Chances are that Jstev is older than you, and he is known to some as Mr. Potatohead.   ...JSTEV!!!
This is Joy. She's Asian!
This is Laura. She works with mammals!
I'm Leanna. I'm a rising junior in Course 20. I like gymnastics and NCAA basketball (men's). I have an intense passion for the Situation.
This is Paul. He lived in Switzerland for years, and yes, he's related to John Muir.
This is Shawn. His unorthodox protocols may one day culminate in several BioBrick standards.
This is Shirley. She's a vegan, but apparently wouldn't mind feasting on her fellow humans. She also enjoys the artist Joanna Newsom, implying she has a few screws loose in her head. Most importantly, however, Shirley is *hungry.*
