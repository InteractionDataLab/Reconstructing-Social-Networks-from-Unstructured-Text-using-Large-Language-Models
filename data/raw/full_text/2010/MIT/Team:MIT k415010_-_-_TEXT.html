K415010
From the 2010 MIT iGEM Team . See the Parts Registry Page!! →
This composite is composed of the parts BBa_K415000 and BBa_S03119. It can produce both luxR and mCherry. The production of luxR is normally constitutive, but can be repressed by TetR and derepressed by aTc. The production of mCherry is activated by c6-AHL and luxR, and repressed by cI. This is a test part that generates a reporter. It also contains an additional R0065 hybrid promoter appended after the LuxR : Term : Term.
