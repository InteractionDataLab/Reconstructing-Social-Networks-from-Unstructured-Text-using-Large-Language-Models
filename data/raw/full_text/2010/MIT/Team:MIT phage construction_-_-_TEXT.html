PARTS
BBa_K415100
Components: RBS : M13 PVIII
Explanation: This is a basic translational unit: a ribosome-binding site and the p8 gene.  You can attach any promoter in front of it for expression.
BBa_K415108
Components: RBS : M13 PIII
Explanation: This is a basic translational unit: a ribosome-binding site and the p3 gene.  You can attach any promoter in front of it for expression.
BBa_K415138
Components: pLac : RBS : M13 PIII
Explanation: This is a basic expression unit: a promoter in front of a ribosome-binding site and the p3 gene.  We used this to generate constitutive expression of p3 in cells infected with hyperphage in an attempt to rescue the wild-type, non-hairy phenotype.  See the results page for an AFM image of this working.
BBa_K415147 - K415152
Components: PluxR/cI : RBS : mCherry : Term : PtetR : RBS : LuxR:Term : Plux/cI : RBS : M13 PVIII-Zipper
Explanation: These parts are K415010 + RBS + P8-fusion protein.  As is, this part produces mCherry and the p8-fusion gene in the presence of c6-AHL (and there's also non-trivial leaky expression).  When combined with the Hyperphage plasmid, the p8-fusion protein should become incorporated into the phage coat along with normal p8; zippers should then be exposed on the polyphage hairs outside of the cell, allowing for potential cross-linking among cells.  With the Collins toggle, UV exposure can be used to control the expression of the p8-fusion protein.  Note: below is K415147 only; the rest are similar but with a different translational unit on the end for each linker (Fos, Jun, ACID, BASE, GR1, GR2).
