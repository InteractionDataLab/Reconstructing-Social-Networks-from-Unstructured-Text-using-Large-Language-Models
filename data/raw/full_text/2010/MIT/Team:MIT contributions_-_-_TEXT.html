Mammalian Standard

Beyond Biobricks
In addition to working hard in the lab, our team cares about the social implications of synthetic biology and developing new tools to push further along the synthetic biology frontier!! We interviewed some of the leading researchers in the synthetic biology field. We asked them about their opinions on the complex interaction between intellectual property law and synthetic biology. We also developed a new Mammalian standard for the registry! We hope this will help encourage future synthetic biology research in mammalian genetics.
