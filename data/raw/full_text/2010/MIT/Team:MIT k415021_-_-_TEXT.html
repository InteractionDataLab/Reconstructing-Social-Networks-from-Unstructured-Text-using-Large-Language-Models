K415021
From the 2010 MIT iGEM Team . See the Parts Registry Page!! →
This part displays red and green fluorescence under specific conditions. Fluorescence is activated by presence of both LuxR and 3OC6HSL. The LuxR is normally constitutively expressed, but can be repressed by TetR and derepressed by aTc. Green fluorescence is repressed by LacI and red fluorescence is repressed by CI. This part is intended to be used along with the LacI/CI bistable toggle switch by Jim Collins.
