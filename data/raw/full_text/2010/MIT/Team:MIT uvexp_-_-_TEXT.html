bacterial experimental setup
Grow cell lawn in M9 minimal top agar. Keep out of the light. Remove top of petri dish, and cover cells with mask that exposes parts of the agar.
Put masked cells into apparatus that ensures there will be no UV exposure to the sides of the plate, and minimizes reflection of the UV from the bottom of the plate.
Expose cells to predetermined power of UV exposure, remove petri dish, recover, and reincubate.
