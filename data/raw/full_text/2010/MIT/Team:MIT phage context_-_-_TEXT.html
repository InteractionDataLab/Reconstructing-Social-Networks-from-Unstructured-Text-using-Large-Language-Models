hairy cells and polymerizing phage - context
WORK FROM OTHER IGEM TEAMS
The following teams have used some component of our phage system previously.  No other teams have used our method of polyphage with incorporated coiled coils for polymerization (nor is it present in the literature).
In 2006 the McGill team attempted to use leucine zippers fused to split YFP to display on cells and cause the cells to adhere via the split YFP.  See here .
The 2009 Freiburg Bioware team used Fos/Jun for a 'programmable enzyme' using Fok-fused Fos/Jun as factor in DNA cleavage.  See here .
Paris's team in 2009 attempted to use Jun/Fos as a snare; Jun on signal vesicle, Fos on membrane of receiving cell.  See here .
This year, Duke's team is using Jun- and Fos-based synthetic leucine zippers for genetic regulation.  See here .
CROSS-LINKING IN THE LITERATURE
Willis et al. (2008) used external cross-linking agents and phage display to create phage polymer bundles as well as a 1cm^3 cube of polymerized phage.
Sweeney et al. (2007) used leucine zippers (ACID/BASE and Jun/Fos) on p3 and p9 to create linear arrays of phage up to 30 in length.
The Belcher lab has also been involved in using M13 to create assemblies, such as nanowires and rings.  See Huang, et al. (2005) and Mao, et al. (2004).
