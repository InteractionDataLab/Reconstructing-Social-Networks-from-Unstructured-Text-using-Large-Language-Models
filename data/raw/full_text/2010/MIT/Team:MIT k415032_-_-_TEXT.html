Improved PLux/cI-OR Promoter
This part is a promoter that was designed as a correction to the anomalous BBa_R0065 BioBrick. This part consists of a Lux Box binding site for the LuxR-C6HSL Complex; in addition, it contains two operator sites for the cI protein appropriated from the Lambda bacteriophage. Because basal expression without the LuxR-C6HSL complex present is expected to be minimal, and because the cI operator sites are positioned so as to block the critical -10 transcription initiation site on the promoter, if cI is high, the promoter is off; if AHL is low and cI is absent, the promoter is leaky; if AHL is high and cI is absent, the promoter is on.
Slightly weaker binding than K415031 .
