Overview     Peptide YY     Population Control
 
Summary of the Project
     The Citadel team decided to tackle  a unique and exciting challenge for iGEM 2010.   In humans and many other mammalian species there exists an intricate  communication network between the digestive system and the central nervous system  (CNS) called the brain-gut axis.   Interactions between the two regions of the axis are performed by  hormonal peptides produced by cells within the gastrointestinal tract.  These proteins are absorbed into the bloodstream,  traverse the blood-brain barrier, and interact directly with neurons within the  brain to regulate the intake of calories.   Inspired by this connection between the gastronomic system and the CNS,  and acutely aware of the plethora of engineer-able microbes already inhabiting  the human GI microbiome, The Citadel team set out to harness this potent  natural system for applications to human and animal health, especially in the  areas of medical diagnostics and drug delivery.   The student researchers pursued a project that would demonstrate the production  in E.coli of a novel protein associated with the brain-gut axis,as  well as indicate the far-reaching potential for engineered microbes to  influence complex systems in remote regions of the body.  Hunger was an especially appealing target for  bacterial influence, and quickly became the focus of the project.  The team identified a protein, Peptide  Tyrosine Tyrosine (3-36), abbreviated PYY3-36 which is naturally  generated by L cells within the intestines in response to calorie absorption  after a meal.  PYY3-36  migrates across the brain-gut axis and binds  to receptors within the hypothalamus, triggering the activation of pathways  that result in taste aversion, a decrease in pancreatic secretion, and a  reduction in appetite.  The Citadel team  converted the PYY3-36 gene into the Biobrick standard format and  designed a system for it's expression and control.
 
Genetic Circuit Design
     There are two separate modules  contained within the circuit envisioned by The Citadel iGEM team.  The next few paragraphs are devoted to a  explanation of how these modules were designed and what they accomplish.  Please refer to the illustrations – they  will be very helpful as you follow the description of the circuit.
 
The PYY 3-36 Module
     The first module is a simple means for  generating the peptide of interest.  A  Biobrick protein coding sequence encoding PYY3-36 is inserted into  an translational unit.  A constituatively  expressed promoter (the team selected J23102 for its high RPU) and a ribosome  binding site (B0034) are placed upstream of the coding region (K373000),  triggering the transcription of PYY3-36.  A double terminator  (B0015) signals the end ofthe sequence.  This module is as fundamental as possible,  ensuring consistent expression of the target protein while allowing for  interchangeability with other peptides without affecting the operation of the  second module in the genetic circuit.
 
The Population Control Module
     The second molecule of the genetic  circuit is intended to regulate the expression of PYY3-36 .  Overproduction of the peptide needs to be  prevented.  To accomplish this goal, the  team chose to couple cell death with a quorum sensing system.  The module is divided into two parts.  In the first part, a promoter and ribosome  binding site are inserted upstream of an AHL coding sequence (F1610).  Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) is  expressed.  This molecule serves as an  inter-cellular message system, diffusing through the cell membrane along  concentration gradients and giving each cell a basic means of detecting its  colony's size/condition.   Quorum sensing  of the AHL molecule allows a cap to be placed on the population size of the  engineered E.coli colony by enforcing cell death once the colony has  reached a sufficient size.  This is  accomplished by way of the second part of the Population Control module.
     A cell-signaling promoter (F2620)  specifically active in the presence of AHL begins transcription.  Then a sensitivity tuner is inserted into the  circuit.  This component acts as a  precision activation mechanism, a gateway that allows downstream transcription  only if the Polymerase per Second (PoPS) input falls within a specific  range.  Any of the various sensitivity  tuners developed by Cambridge 2009   (K274370-K274395) can be integrated into our device to achieve the  desired result, population capping, and variation of which tuner is used will  yield different limits.  The higher the  PoPS requirement of the sensitivity tuner used, the larger a colony can grow  before the countermeasure (the production of a cell poison) is engaged.  Once the sensitivity tuner's activator is  synthesized, translation of the downstream regions of the circuit begins.  The poison gene CcdB (P1010) has been selected  to balance the increasing number of engineered cells due to replication.  Once the requirement set by the sensitivity  tuner has been met, cells begin to produce poison, preventing the colony's  growth.  Thus, the team can ensure a  strict limit to the amount of PYY3-36 produced.       
Successes and Failures
     The Citadel team has succeeded in  formulating a system for the expression and regulation of PYY3-36 in E.coli.  We have designed a  Biobrick part (K373000) that encodes the protein of interest.  This part has been been ordered synthesized,  and will be made available in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Due to time constraints and the natural  hurdles encountered by a group of undergraduate students and professors new to  biological engineering and the iGEM competition, The Citadel team has not yet  been able to characterize the Biobrick parts it has built.  We hope to continue this work in the future  or to inspire others to continue researching PYY3-36.
