We  had no produce to sell. Instead, we came with a demonstration of everyday  science and a determination to inspire our friends and neighbors.  Our marketing division devised two clever  strategies for gaining people's attention:
  1.         give away cookies and &quot;petri dish Jell-O&quot;
  2.         post an enormous sign offering everyone “Free DNA!”.</P><P class="BodyText">     Inspired by projects from the  DIYbio community, our team offered a basic biology experiment to patrons of the Farmer's Market. Visitors  to our table were invited to extract DNA from strawberries using store bought products available in every  household. Young children, in particular, enjoyed the cookies, while parents, grandparents  and others enjoyed the opportunity to ask us questions about iGEM, the chemical  reactions of our experiment, GMOs, science, education, and more. A highly diverse group of  people visited our stall, including middle school teachers, postgraduate  researchers, kindergarteners, market vendors, and at least one very curious  homeless person. The questions they asked often surprised us; we had   not  expected to field questions ra<SPAN class="BodyText">nging from the most basic to highly specialized  all within the same day. The messages we conveyed to our visitors were simple:</SPAN></P><P class="BodyText">1.         Science and engineering are not solely the domain of professionals, but               can be pursued in everyday life.
  2.         Synthetic biology, an emerging discipline that integrates many fields of               science, engineering, and information technology, asks important              questions and  offers unique, exciting opportunities for invention and              creativity. 
  3.         iGEM is an example of young people who are inspired and driven to               innovate.</P><P class="BodyText"><SPAN class="BodyText">     The Downtown DNA Event was a  great success. </SPAN>We made contact with hundreds of many interesting people and  were able to share our interest in synthetic biology with them.  We hope to do this again and  encourage other teams to find a means for  interacting with their local communities as we have.</P><P class="BodyText">     If you are interested in  performing the simple and rewarding DNA extraction we demoed at the Charleston  Farmer's market, or if you would like to host an event of your own, we have  provided a copy of the handout we distributed at the event. It gives  instructions for the setup and completion of the extraction.
