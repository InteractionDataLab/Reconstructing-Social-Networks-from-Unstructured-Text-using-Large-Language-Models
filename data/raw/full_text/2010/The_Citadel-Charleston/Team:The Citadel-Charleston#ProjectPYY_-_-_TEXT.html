Overview of the Protein
     PYY3-36 is an endogenous  hormone of the ileum and colon, postprandially released in proportion to the  calories consumed during a meal.  The  peptide can be absorbed into the circulatory system and pass the blood-brain  barrier, where it acts as a primary contributor to energy homeostasis.  By exerting agonist action on the NPY  Y2-receptor in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,  PYY3-36 causes an inhibition of  gastric motility and a substantial reduction in appetite.
     PYY3-36 has received  considerable research attention in Homo sapiens and in various rodent  species.  The effects of supplementation  to a subject's natural PYY3-36 levels with additional peptide have  been well characterized.  Studies attempting  to discover a variation in the amount of PYY3-36 produced by obese  persons to that produced by a lean person have been inconclusive, but its  anorectic effect remains unchallenged.   PYY3-36's ability to reduce appetite in persons of all body  types is widely accepted within the scientific community.  The peptide has therefore been identified for  potential usage in the treatment of obesity and appetite dysfunction.
     In one example study, human  subjects were given an infusion of either PYY3-36 (2 nmol / m2 body-surface area) or  saline solution.  After two hours had  elapsed, all subjects were offered a buffet meal capable of satisfying any  appetite.  Consumption rates were  strictly measured, and it was shown that the caloric  intake of individuals who had received the PYY3-36 infusion ate 30%  less on average than subjects who received the saline infusion.  The results of this study were consistent  irrespective of a subject's body type.    Lean or obese, subjects universally displayed a marked decrease in appetite.
 
PYY 3-36 at The Citadel
     The goal  of The Citadel iGEM team was to construct a RFC10-complaint Biobrick part that  encoded the protein PYY3-36 and could be successfully integrated  into genetic circuits in the chassis E.coli.  Furthermore, we hoped to show that, with  Biobrick protein coding sequences such as PYY3-36, systems could be  designed for E.coli (or other chassis native to the intestinal  microbiome) that would have application potential as novel, safe, and potent  means for influencing neurological processes such as appetite from across the  brain-gut axis.
