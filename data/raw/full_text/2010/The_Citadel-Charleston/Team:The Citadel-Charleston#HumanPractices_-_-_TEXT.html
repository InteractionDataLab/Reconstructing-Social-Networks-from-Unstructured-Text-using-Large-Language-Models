Team:The Citadel-Charleston/HumanPractices
From 2010.igem.org
Untitled Document
     Engaging communities is an  important part of the IGEM experience, and The Citadel team actively pursued  connections with both local neighbors and our fellow teams over the course of  the summer.
 
Downtown DNA Event
     Early on the morning of June 6,  2010 the three members of The Citadel team set up a stall at the farmers’ market in downtown Charleston, SC. We  had no produce to sell. Instead, we came with a demonstration of everyday  science and a determination to inspire our friends and neighbors.  Our marketing division devised two clever  strategies for gaining people's attention:
1.         give away cookies and "petri dish Jell-O"
2.         post an enormous sign offering everyone “Free DNA!”.
     Inspired by projects from the  DIYbio community, our team offered a basic biology experiment to patrons of the Farmer's Market. Visitors  to our table were invited to extract DNA from strawberries using store bought products available in every  household. Young children, in particular, enjoyed the cookies, while parents, grandparents  and others enjoyed the opportunity to ask us questions about iGEM, the chemical  reactions of our experiment, GMOs, science, education, and more. A highly diverse group of  people visited our stall, including middle school teachers, postgraduate  researchers, kindergarteners, market vendors, and at least one very curious  homeless person. The questions they asked often surprised us; we had   not  expected to field questions ranging from the most basic to highly specialized  all within the same day. The messages we conveyed to our visitors were simple:
1.         Science and engineering are not solely the domain of professionals, but              can be pursued in everyday life.
2.         Synthetic biology, an emerging discipline that integrates many fields of              science, engineering, and information technology, asks important              questions and  offers unique, exciting opportunities for invention and              creativity.
3.         iGEM is an example of young people who are inspired and driven to              innovate.
     The Downtown DNA Event was a  great success. We made contact with hundreds of many interesting people and  were able to share our interest in synthetic biology with them.  We hope to do this again and  encourage other teams to find a means for interacting with their local communities as we have.
     If you are interested in  performing the simple and rewarding DNA extraction we demoed at the Charleston  Farmer's market, or if you would like to host an event of your own, we have  provided a copy of the handout we distributed at the event. It gives  instructions for the setup and completion of the extraction. Click on the image  below for a larger version.
 
iGEM Surveys
     In addition to community  outreach, our team participated in three surveys hosted by other iGEM  teams.  Look below for a brief summary of  these surveys, and please follow the links to learn more about these teams and their  human practice projects:
Mexico-UNAM-CINESTAV  circulated a survey focused on the legal issues at the heart synthetic  biology.  Engineering in a space where  nature has provided many of the tools is a unique legal challenge, and the  questions of intellectual property and patent rights have yet to be  decided.  UNAM Mexico is working to  address these questions.  
METU_TURKEY_SOFTWARE designed  an intra-iGEM survey to determine user's opinions of the Registry of Standard  Biological Parts, with the aim of improving and updating the means by which  teams acquire and submit parts. .
