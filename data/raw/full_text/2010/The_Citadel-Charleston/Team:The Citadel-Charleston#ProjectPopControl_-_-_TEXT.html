Overview     Peptide YY     Population Control
 
     Early in the planning stages of The Citadel team's project,  it became apparent that, while production of PYY3-36 by E.coli would be a great accomplishment, for the peptide to be an effective candidate  for microbial supplementation and use in a brain-gut appetite control system  such as we envisioned, it would need to be under strict regulation.  Overproduction of the peptide ought to be  prevented by a module secondary to the original peptide production  component.  This new module would work to  maintain a specific, desirable level of PYY3-36 production.  The team set out to create such a device.
     The system that the team chose to accomplish a limitation of  PYY3-36 production is simple in principle, built off the concept  that the most effective way to prevent a cell from producing a peptide is to  eliminate the cell.  With this in mind,  the team constructed a poison-generating module that becomes activated only  once the colony of cells has reached such a density that additional PYY3-36  production is not required. 
     Three key features make this population limit possible.  The first is inter-cellular communication, or  quorum sensing.  The AHL family of  molecules is produced constituatively by all cells in the colony.  These molecules accumulate within the cell  and diffuse into the extracellular space.   As the colony grows, the concentration gradient is reversed, and uptake  of AHL into the cells dominates.  In this  way, AHL acts as a broadcasting system for the density of the colony as a  whole.
     The second feature required for the team's population  control module is the sensitivity tuner.   Thanks to work done previously by the Cambridge iGEM teams from multiple  years, the Registry now boasts a set of parts designed to fine-tune the level  at which transcription of a given downstream sequence can begin.  When coupled with the AHL inter-cellular  communication system described above, these parts allow the designer to  construct a device which sets a precise threshold marker for population size,  the attainment of which triggers the transcription of downstream sequences in  the circuit.  Essentially, sensitivity  tuners have allowed The Citadel team to set up a gateway, through which only  sufficiently dense colonies can pass.
     The third and final feature of the population control  circuit is the element which actually performs the limiting, a cell poison. The CcdB gene was selected for this purpose, as it is lethal when expressed  in E.coli and has been shown to be effective at population control in  existing scientific research.  The  peptide operates by rendering DNA gyrase nonfunctional.  Once the translation of CcdB has begun, the  colony size begins to decrease as cells die from exposure to the poison.  The cell population size continues to drop  until it is below the density level which is capable of producing enough AHL to  trigger transcription of the poison downstream of the sensitivity tuner.  The cycle then repeats itself, with the  colony beginning to grow again until it passes the threshold, then decreasing  in density until poison production is cut off.   This oscillatory period has been shown in previous research to dampen as  the cycles continue, leveling out along the “switch point” where CcdB is  expressed
