Sriram Srikant is a Senior in the B.Tech Program of Chemical Engineering with a Minor in Chemistry. Tall and lanky, and almost perpetually sleep deprived, he has a deep rooted interest in all things biological, with a particular taste for the internal chemistry of life. His experience affords him a very analytical and thorough perception on all problems. Sriram is looking to work towards a PhD in Biochemistry and/or Biophysics. <P margin="5px">
He can be woken up at <A href="mailto:saisriram15@gmail.com">saisriram15@gmail.com</A></P></DIV><DIV id="text"><B>Srivathsan Adivarahan</B>
Srivathsan Adivarahan is Senior undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in Biotechnology. He's spent lots of credited class hours exploring and finding himself, and he shows the same passion when he tries to figure out and understand biological systems. He's made up for his lack of understanding in biology by using his blessed mathematical and statistical skills. He's amazed by the complexities of the living system and sees life from a statistical viewpoint. He enjoys drawing analogies between biology in the world we live in. He intends to pursue his PhD in stochastic modeling of biological systems.
<P margin="5px">
It's better if you contact him at <A href="mailto:vatsi.in.iitm@gmail.com">vatsi.in.iitm@gmail.com</A> cause he's never going to pick up your calls.
