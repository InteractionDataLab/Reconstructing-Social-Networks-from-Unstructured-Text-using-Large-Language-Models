Research Interests
Recombinant Protein production:
Current work involves the investigation of different host-vector systems; studying the kinetic and thermodynamic limitations of gene over-expression; and evolving optimal bioreactor strategies for high-yield production of recombinant proteins.
Design of novel bioseparation processes for large-scale protein purification:
Non-linear liquid chromatographic processes; development of affinity-based aqueous two-phase extraction processes for protein purification; protein re-folding.
Design of Microfluidic Devices for Biomolecular Analysis:
This project has been recently initiated, mainly focused on development of silicon-based microfabricated devices for DNA analysis. Development of high throughput devices will have a significant impact on genome sequencing technologies.
