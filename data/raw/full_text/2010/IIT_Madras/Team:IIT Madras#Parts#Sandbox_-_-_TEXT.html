Parts Submitted
This page describes the construction protocol we wished to follow, and also the final design we hoped to achieve.
Legend
This color represents the portion to be added by Extension PCR / Inverse PCR / Assembly PCR
This color represents sites that lie in the middle of the parts to be submitted. These are placed so that the promoters and the inserts can be switched out.
This represents an apparent restriction site, one that cannot be used due to the sequences' presence in an ORF
The following were the primers we designed for conducting our experiments we obtained from other laboratories in our institute. For Monellin, we planned to use Single Chain Monellin obtained from primary literature as the gene-of-interest.
Gene of 295 bp to be synthesised by Assembly PCR / LCR.
