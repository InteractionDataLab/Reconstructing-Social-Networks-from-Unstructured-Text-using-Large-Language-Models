Welcome to the page describing the different members of the IIT Madras iGEM 2010 team. We had a large number of undergraduates working under the guidance of both professors and post-graduates at our institute. Here's saying Hi to all the others iGEM'ers out there and hoping to see you at the Jamboree next week.
