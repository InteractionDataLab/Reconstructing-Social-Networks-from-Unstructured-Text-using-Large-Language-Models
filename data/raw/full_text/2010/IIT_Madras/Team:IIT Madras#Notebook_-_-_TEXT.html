Week 1
21st Aug 2010
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Primary Inoculation in 2XYT media, from XL10Gold (from Srivats) plates; Single colonies couldn't be discerned.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] 200ml Transformation buffer prepared; Mncl2, CaCl2.6H2O, KCl and PIPES (10mM). Left in fridge to be filter purified.
•    [Harsh, Sonia] OD of primary inoculation checked and found to be zero. Primary inoculation re-done.
•    [Harsh, Sonia] Protocols of L.lactis taken from Shashi and noted down in lab note.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Secondary inoculation (from second trial) of sample 2 (OD600nm = 0.126) of 1ml, 2ml in fresh 2XYT done; Blank samples of media taken before transfer.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Flasks kept in 22deg shaker of room 310. To be checked at 1400 hours.
Additional Notes
•    Met Ashish who did not have pGFP but asked us to buy it from Addgene. This must be done on Monday along with the order for CRE vector.
•    Checked for pGFP vector on net, found out to be too expensive to afford.
22nd Aug 2010
•    [Harsh, Amarnath] Ultra competent cells of XL10Gold prepared (later found out that the aliquote doesn’t have any cells).
•    [Avaneesh] Problem discovered in the prepared Transformation buffer, which should have been made to pH=6.8 and stored at -40degC. Transformation buffer remade by Avaneesh.
•    [Amarnath, Chaitra] pEGFP colony inoculated in 4 test tubes for miniprep. Left overnight in 37degC shaker at 200rpm.
23rd Aug 2010
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Two test tubes of inoculated pEGFP minipreped and DNA stored in -40degC. DNA made 10x dilute (by adding excess Elution buffer), corrected by repeating binding with PB buffer and re-eluting in correct amount of EB.
•    [Amarnath] XL10Gold transformed with K272001 (RFP) to check competency of cells. Unsuccessful due to media contamination.
24th Aug 2010
•    [Chaitra] Material sent for autoclaving and decontamination.
•    [Chaitra] 500ml of LB and 100ml of 2XYT liquid media prepared and autoclaved.

•    [Sonia] Transformation of XL10Gold with K272001 (RFP) to check competency. One control with no DNA also incorporated.
•     [Vatsi, Sriram] Digested pEGFP samples 1 & 2, the flow through of excess buffer and a control with no enzymes. Digestion was done with 5mul DNA, 4mul Pst1, 1 mul BSA, 10mul NEB Buffer 2 and made upto 100mul with milliQ water. Left for 60 min at 37degC, followed by heat-inactivation at 80degC for 20 min. Digest mix in UG lab fridge.
26th Aug 2010
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] (Repeat) Double digest attempted with pEGFP samples 1 & 2, the flow through of sample 1 and a control with no enzymes. Digestion was done with 5mul DNA, 0.3mul Pst1, 0.3mul Not1, 1mul NEB Buffer 3 (as found from the NEB site), and made upto 10mul with milliQ water. Left for 180min at 37degC, followed by heat-inactivation at 80degC for 20min.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Prepared EtBr stock of 10mg/ml and stored in 1.5ml eppendorf in UG lab fridge.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram, Amarnath, Varun] Prepared Gel with 100ml 1X TAE Buffer, 1g Agarose, and 5mul of EtBr stock (after microwave-dissolving the agarose and cooling)
•    [Vatsi, Sriram, Harsh, Amarnath, Varun, Praneet] Ran the gel with a 1kb ladder, pEGFP control, pEGFP samples 1 & 2 digestion mix, and pEGFP flow through sample 1 digestion mix. Gel was run at 150V for 20 min.
Results
•    Gel shows that digestion was ineffective, with the samples showing smears similar to the control. Suggested solution - Run a gel for the single digested samples to verify whether, problem was run specific or protocol-based.
•    The gel was seen to crumble very easily, often as seen when water replaces TAE Buffer. Suggested solution - Re-prepare 50X TAE Buffer stock.
•    The gel assembly showed a large amount of particulate debris. Suggested solution - Assembly to be cleaned, before and after every use.
27th Aug 2010
•    [Sriram] Designed the part to be synthesized by PCR / LCR assembly. Incorporated six restriction sites and noted that a Not1 site occurs in SCM. Also incorporated the loxP sites.
•    [Sriram] Used TmPrime to design the primers / oligonucleotides required for PCR and LCR synthesis.
•    [Vatsi] Ordering - NEB, Chemicals have quotations ready. Discovered that the pGFP vector is too expensive and that the pEGFP we have may be a bacterial expression vector (Plac, expression with IPTG). Must confirm. Another alternative for the CRE vector without Not1 located.
•    [Sriram] Funding - Possibilty of funding by Shri discussed with Sayash. Experiment design and future work presented to Shri for funding.
•    [Srivats, Vatsi, Harsh, Sriram, Varun, Amarnath, Vivek, Chetan] Experimental design - Designed 4 blocks of independent proof-of-concept experiments. One for promoter characterisation, SCM productivity, export efficiency and CRE activity under promoter.
•    Parts design - Spoke about the requirement of designing parts based on digestion and ligation requirements and available restriction enzymes.Final parts must contain the E, X, S & P, as specified by standard assembly.
28th Aug 2010
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Met Shashi to discuss the errors that were made in the Primer design. She explained that there are specifics with respect to the entire construct's synthesis (synthetic, PCR and cloning).
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] Especially important is the planning of the restriction sites to be used in the subparts. We also need to add extension PCR steps in the middle to homogenize the Restriction sites to enable ligations, not only for the final construct but also for the proof-of-concept constructs.
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] She also pointed out the misconceptions we had regarding the promoters involved. Pnis is active only aftere OD=0.6 and Pacid is only active only between ph=5.0 to 6.5
•    [Vatsi, Sriram] The final construct was re-designed to NICE+CRE+Terminator;lozP(Pacid+Export+SCM)loxP+Terminator
•    [Harsh, Nishant, Vatsi, Sriram] Designed all the parts involved and marked out all the restriction enzymes that can be used and have to avoided. The design process has been outlined on a google wave.
•    [Sriram] The proposal was re-written and forwarded the same to Guhan. This is to be sent to CSIR, Dr.Reddy's, etc.
•    [Chaitra, Avaneesh] Preparation of the TAE Buffer and EDTA stock was started and the salt was left to dissolve. The salt dissolved and the solution was placed in our shelf.

Week 7
3rd Oct 2010
•    [Sriram] Prepared primary inoculum of the Electro-competent cell preparation protocol.

Water chosen as solvent for DNA and left to dissolve overnight.
•    [Nishant, Vatsi, Harsh, Sriram] Discovered error in part design in that RFP contains the restriction sites of Kpn1 and HindIII, which are used in part construction. Original plan of using RFP as expression system abandoned and new system based on Luciferase in pGL3Basic proposed (Nishant’s idea).
Primers are not wasted and only one new primer required to submit parts involving the two primers, their combination with Luciferase and Constitutive with Luciferase.
7th Oct 2010
•    [Harsh, Sriram] Inoculated 36ml of GSGM17 media with 4ml of primary culture of NZ9000 to obtain 40ml of Secondary inoculum. Checked OD till it reached 0.23 and then the protocol was continued. Error committed in using volume of buffers required for 100ml culture. Final solvent used enough for 200ml. Cell concentration too low. A problem was faced in timely preparation of the required buffers from corresponding stock solutions.
•    [Kousik, Sriram] Second stage of MaxiPrep executed taking special care to ensure that appropriate volumes are used and DNA is not lost in transfer. Ethanol pellet left for air-drying overnight.
•    [Chaitra] Compiled the results of the survey conducted in the technical festival and conclusions was drafted.

25th Oct 2010
•    [Sriram] Realised lack of plasmid in K372003_1C3 could be due to lack of antibiotic in the broth. Reinoculated K372003_1C3 and K372003_1A3 for miniprep.

•    [Vatsi] Discovered that our Quick Ligase had been left outside in water. Ran a reaction ligating Const+SP310mut2, followed by a PCR to amplify the ligated product. Ran controls with no template, only Const and only SP310. Discovered that the response of our ligation+PCR was the multiplication of SP310.
•    [Chaitra] Inoculated all colonies from the P170+pGL3 and Const+pGL3 plates into liquid media with negative controls. Alongside inoculated K272001_1A2 as a reference plasmid, colony from K372001_1A3 plate for repeating miniprep step.
