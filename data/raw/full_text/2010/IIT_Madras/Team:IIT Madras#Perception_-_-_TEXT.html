Survey
A survey was conducted during the annual technical festival of IIT Madras (Shaastra), where people were asked a few basic questions to ask their knowledge about diabetes. The results of the survey were compiled and we've come to the following conclusion:
With India having the highest number of diabetes patients in the world, we, the IIT Madras iGEM 2010 team conducted a survey to analyze the views of the people on Diabetes, Synthetic Biology and Artificial Sweeteners. People are aware of the grim situation in the country with respect to Diabetes. About 65% of the survey population thinks that Diabetes results in most number of deaths a year and 89% know for a fact that Diabetes is not contagious. Insulin (78%) and sugar (48%) are the top 2 words associated by this well informed survey population. The understanding of Insulin produced by the body to maintain the blood sugar levels (blood glucose levels) of the body is crucial. It is a common myth that eating more sugar will lead to diabetes.
Considering our survey population included students of the age group 18-22 it wasn’t astonishing when 89% of them chose synthetic biology to be designing and constructing new systems running on principles of biology as opposed to synthetically creating life. 41% of them also believed advances in Science and Technology will soon result in the discovery of anti cancer drug.
Though 36% of the survey population connected Escherichia coli with Intestine, only 11% of them knew that E.Coli is used as a model organism in laboratories and 25% made E.Coli, the pathogen which causes the malfunctioning of Insulin Gene. It was quite alarming to note that 44% of this young population had safety issues with Artificial Sweeteners.
Lastly, 41% of them liked sweet curd which gives a nice hope to our product.
2010 is the second year of five-year focus on 'Diabetes education and prevention", the theme selected by the International Diabetes Federation and the World Health Organization for World Diabetes Day 2009-2013. We aim at restoring their sweet tooth and We Unite for Diabetes.
