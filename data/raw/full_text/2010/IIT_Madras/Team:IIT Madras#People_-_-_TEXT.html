Meet the Undergraduates
Sriram Srikant
Sriram Srikant is a Senior in the B.Tech Program of Chemical Engineering with a Minor in Chemistry. Tall and lanky, and almost perpetually sleep deprived, he has a deep rooted interest in all things biological, with a particular taste for the internal chemistry of life. His experience affords him a very analytical and thorough perception on all problems. He is looking to work towards a PhD in Biochemistry and/or Biophysics
He can be woken up at saisriram15@gmail.com
Srivathsan Adivarahan
Srivathsan Adivarahan is 4th Year Undergraduate student pursuing dual degree in Biotechnology. Like all his days at college exploring himself he likes to explore the biological system. He overcame his lack of understanding in biology with blessed mathematical and statistical skills. Amazed by the complexities of the living system he sees Life from a statistical perspective and always likes drawing analogies in the world we live in. Whatever happens this iGEM, he would like to pursue his PhD in Stochastic Modeling of biological systems.
Its better if you contact him at vatsi.in.iitm@gmail.com cause he's never gonna pick up your call.
Nishant
Nishant, Senior in The Department of Biotechnology pursuing dual degree and also the 'Seniormost' student member of the iGEM team keeps a keen interest in Biology with a special inclination towards metabolic pathways and cellular functioning. He would also like to pursue his PhD in related fields. He is also a devout foodie and an enthusiastic explorer but sports comes first in his hobby list!
He is (not always) availabe at nishantdk@gmail.com
Harsh Nagpal
Harsh Nagpal, a senior in the Department of Biotechnology. Someone who by a twist of fate landed up studying biology and has loved it ever since. Interested in Synthetic and developmental biology, hopes to one day have doctor before his name An expert at killing flies (for the sake of science). A lover of good food and a good time, can always be found  where there's free food (and drink) around.
Always online at hnagpal89@gmail.com
Sonia Chothani
That's Sonia Chothani currently a pre-final year student at IITMadras pursuing BTech in Biotechnology. Very passionate about the MATH of LIFE. The complexities of living systems amaze her the most. With experience in theoretical modeling of biochemical pathways her interest has grown in this field and she would like to pursue further studies in the same. Passionate about dance as well and hence believes that "Passion is all you need for excellence
Ping her (if you are lucky enough to find her NOT 'invisible') at sonya2611@gmail.com
Kousik Sundararajan
Kousik is a Junior Undergrad student yet another pursuing B.Tech in Biotechnology (Minor in Biomedical Engineering). A nocturnal IITian, totally enthusiastic about being the change that he wants to see in the world. Bio-'Gyan' is his (self-declared) strength. An environment activist who loves the potential of Solar energy and Bio-fuels. Believes strongly that bio-enthusiasts like himself are the real saviors of the earth.
Reach him at kousik.sun@gmail.com
Avaneesh T
With a crazy streak of creativity, and a need for constant entertainment Avaneesh T is a Junior pursuing a B.Tech in Biotechnology with all the enthusiasm of a 5 year old kid in a Toy store. Interested in everything biology, he is yet to choose his stream of interest. He has always dreamed of being called a Doctor, but his fear of the field of Healthcare means his dream can be reached only through a PhD.
Check if he is awake at avaneesh.t@gmail.com
Chaitra Prabhakar
Chaitra Prabhakar, a Junior Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology has immense interest in Research. She enjoys learning about Biochemical pathways and signaling systems and hopes to set a career in Cell biology/Developemental Biology. She considers education and health as two important roads to achieve developement. She loves to contribute to the society in both these respects and hence the motto "We unite for Diabetes" :)
For more mottos, mail her at chaitra.1190@gmail.com
Varun Chokshi
Varun Chokshi, a Junior Undergraduate in the Department of Biotechnology is chilled as a comfortable beer, is the team member responsible for representing the rest of the IITM iGEM team in the academic classes giving the unsuspecting professors the idea of a full class room. He hopes to one day save the world by inventing an alcoholic cure for cancer.
His eharmony user id is not varungr890@gmail.com. Maybe it is, check it out if you'r interested.
Amarnath Bhat
Amarnath is a Junior pursuing a dual degree program in Biotechnology. Hates reading  research papers and almost certainly falls to sleep before reaching the second page. Works better under stress. Has immense interest in synthetic biology.
He is available at amarbhat16@gmail.com
Mahak Singhal
Mahak Singhal, an Undergraduate student at biotech dept. interested mainly in a seek of constant research unveiling the hidden secrets of cell. Appreciating the beauty of nature as my favorite time pass, he loves exploring the evolutionary development of organisms.
Catch me @ mahak906@gmail.com
Chetan Srinath
Chetan Srinath is yet another Sophomore in the Department of Biotechnology. He's someone who doesn't consider himself a waste of protein, and he makes sure it stays that way. An inspirational high school teacher got him interested in biology and he hasn't looked back since. IBO fame apart, Chetan's a Bangalore loving dude who kills time by playing football. He intends to do a Master's and a PhD in the biological sciences although he hasn't decided on what he'd like to specialize in just yet.
Don't miss a chance to get candid with the bio-babe at chetan.srinath@gmail.com.
Vivek Parthasarathy
Vivek “Bladder” Parthasarathy is a Sophomore in the Department of Biotechnology. An 80-something kilogram Carbon-based life form with a semi-American accent, he's still getting a feel for the biological sciences. The prospect of being able to keep people alive forever got him interested in the field at a young age. He is working towards a Master’s in Bioengineering, and an MBA later on. He spends his free time playing Cricket, Quizzing, and killing people by pulling off PJ’s (read as poor jokes, not pajamas).
If he's not hibernating, you can hit him up at vivek.windwaker@gmail.com.
Akshay Rangamani
Akshay Rangamani is a Sophomore in the Department of Electrical Engineering who wears a happy mask all the time. Someone with an interest for all things scientific, the biotechnology elective he picked in school helped him discover his flair for the biosciences. He wishes to pursue a Master's and possibly a PhD in Biomedical Engineering- he chose his current major with this in mind. He spends his free time working on his Carnatic music skills, Quizzing, and shooting hoops.
Feel free to tickle the Pillsbury man at shy492@gmail.com.
