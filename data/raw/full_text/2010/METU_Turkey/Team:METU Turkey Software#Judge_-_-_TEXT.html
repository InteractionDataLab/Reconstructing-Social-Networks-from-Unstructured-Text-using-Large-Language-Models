Team:METU Turkey Software/Judge
From 2010.igem.org
Since the judging form cant save a link with an anchor, we make this page to guide you to our page.. :)
We develop and make available via the Registry an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on standard biological parts.
Link to our page describing how to get this software:
iGEM Wiki Page Name: https://2010.igem.org/Team:METU_Turkey_Software#download
We provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of our software tool, or a second, distinct software tools project.
iGEM Wiki Page Name: https://2010.igem.org/Team:METU_Turkey_Software#miscellaneous4
We outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to our project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Link to this information on our wiki.

For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
We answered the safety question. Click the provided link: https://2010.igem.org/Team:METU_Turkey_Software#miscellaneous3
For iGEM 2010 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.

iGem: Is there any other information about your project you would like to highlight for the judges?
