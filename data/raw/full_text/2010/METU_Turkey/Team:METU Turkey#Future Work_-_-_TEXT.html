- We will use pSB1C3 vector and E.coli Top10 host for other cell sensor components since this vector/host combination worked very well for our pCOOM/RFP device. When other promoter/signal constructs are completed, we will combine strong and weak promoters to complete enhanced dynamic range part of our project.
- Characterization experiments will be further optimized and binding affinity of CooA wild type and mutant response elements will be determined.
