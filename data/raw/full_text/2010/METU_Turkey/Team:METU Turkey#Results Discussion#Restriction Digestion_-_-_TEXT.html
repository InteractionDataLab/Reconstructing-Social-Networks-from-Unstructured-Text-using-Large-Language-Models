- Nuclease Free Water
- Vector
- Buffers
- Restriction Enzymes ( EcorI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI)
- 0.2 mL eppendorf
- P10  micropipette

- Ice
- Ice box
CHECK-LIST PROCEDURE
________________________________________
Experiment Preparation
- Nuclease free water and eppendorfs are autoclaved (1 day before)
- Heat block is set to 37 C
Preparing the Total Mix (for 20 uL total mix)
- Add     uL water nuclease free to 0.2 mL PCR tube
- Add  2 uL appropriate 10x buffer(depending on enzyme type) (thawed before)
- Add     uL DNA solution to the tube (ugr)
- Add 15 unit restriction enzyme to the tube
- Spin the tube for 5 sec
- Incubate the tube for h at 37 C at heatblock
Enzyme Inactivation (EcorI and XbaI)
- Spin the enzyme solution at 100 g for 15 sec
- Incubate at 65 C for 15 min at heatblock
- Store at -20 C in the freezer
Enzyme Inactivation (SpeI and PstI)
- Spin the enzyme solution at 100 g for 15 sec
- Inactivate the enzyme with Fermentas PCR Purification kit
- Store at -20 C in the freezer
Enzyme Inactivation (Fastdigest  NotI)
- Spin the enzyme solution at 100 g for 15 sec
- Incubate at 80 C for 5 min at heatblock
- Store at -20 C in the freezer
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
- Look at procedure for agarose gel electrophoresis
- Load 2 uL sample for confirmation of the restriction
- Load whole sample for insert extraction
Double Digestion
>>> EcorI-SpeI Double Digestion >>>
-  Buffer R
-  4-fold excess of BcuI
-  EcoRI
-  Incubate at 37C
>>> XbaI - PstI Double Digestion
- Buffer O
- PstI
- 4-fold excess of XbaI
- Incubate at 37C
>>> EcorI - PstI Double Digestion
- Buffer O
- PstI
- EcorI
- Incubate at 37C
