Students
Cihan TAŞTAN
2010 is the last year for him as B.S degree at Molecular Biology and Genetics department. Moreover, he is studying at  Computer Engineering  as my minor department. His research will be on Scientist position at Cancer and Virology  Relationship (Let's say Viral Oncology)  by integrating novel technices of Bioinformatics and Synthetic Biology approaches.  This is the second year for him at iGEM.
Sibel ATAOL
Sibel is senior student at Biology department, METU.This is the first year for her in IGEM team.Synthetic biology is the  raising field of Biology what she believes.Studying in biotechnology, bioengineering with novel synthetic biology approaches  is her desire for future.Indeed molecular biology is what she loves to work on so that she is in cloning team.
Funda GUZEY
She is a senior student of Biological Sciences at Middle East Technical University. This is her second year in iGEM competition.  She gained experience in protein expression and purification in this summer. One of the her interests is Synthetic Biology. However, her main interest is Biomedical and Tissue Engineering. She feels lucky to have such a wonderful team and is glad to share  a wonderful summer with her team. .
Ebuzer KALYONCU
Ebuzer is a 4th year student of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Middle East Technical University in Turkey. He was experienced in protein  expression and purification during this summer.He collected some wetlab experience and general knowledge about biotechnology equipments in  Ozen LAB.His main interest is in the regulation of the development and function of the immune system..
Özkan İŞ
Ozkan is especially interested in neuroscience. In near future, he wants to study in molecular neuroscience combined with  synthetic biology approaches. He believes that by applying synthetic biology approaches to synapses, genetic mechanisms  underlying the neurodegenerative diseases will be revealed.
Ceren ŞEREF
Ceren is currently a junior year student of Biology department at Middle East Technical University. It is her first year in METU Syborg and also in iGEM.  She wants to study Neuroscience, especially Neurodegenerative Diseases in the future. Furthermore, she is highly interested in Molecular Biology.  She thinks that Synthetic Biology opens up a whole new page in Biology
Serap MEMİK
Serap is the third year student at the Middle East Technical University. She is highly interested in biotechnology and  molecular biology. She thinks that synthetic biology has great potential and infinite opportunities to practice in human life..
Rengin ERDEM
Rengin is currently a Master’s student of Biotechnology at Middle East Technical University. She has got her Bachelor’s degree  from Gazi University, her major being Biology. She always liked the idea of creating novel systems by utilizing the  information derived from scientific studies. Therefore, she is quite excited to take part in a Synthetic Biology project.  In addition to Synthetic Biology, she is also interested in Biomedical Sciences such as Developmental and Neurological  Biology. Rengin is glad to have an enthusiastic and motivated group of colleagues to work with.
Bilgi GÜNGÖR
Bilgi is first semester student in Master's program of Biotechnology at Middle East Technical University. She is graduated from  Biology Department at METU and joined Metu Syborg iGEM Team during her senior year of her undergradute studies. She is interested in  Molecular Cell Biology and her aim is to solve the mystery of the cell. .
Selin AKKUZU
When Selin participated in iGEM team, she was a senior student in Biology department at METU. She continues her higher education as a Master's student in Biotechnology at the same university. She is mainly interested in Protein Chemistry. She thinks  that Synthetic Biology approaches includes everything in Biology. Therefore, Protein Chemistry and Modeling can be the backbone of  Synthetic Biology. This project is just the beginning for her.
Esen SAYIN
Esen completed the Molecular Biology and Genetics, BSc at Istanbul Technical University. Currently, she is master student in Biotechnology Program at Middle East Technical University and also teaching assistant at METU Biology Department. She enjoys to conduct experiments with fluorophores. She thinks that fluorophores like GFP and RFP have crucial roles at both synthetic biology and biotechnology. Her master thesis involves another type of fluorophore:quantum dots. In the future, she wants to conduct studies involve fluorescent molecules and even their development.
Instructors
Assistant Prof Can OZEN (Team Coordinator)
Dr. Ozen is the head of METU SYBORG (Synthetic Biology Research Group) and the coordinator of METU Turkey team in 2010.  He is also the vice-chair of METU Biotechnology Department and the coordinator of Advanced Light Microscopy, Spectroscopy  and Calorimetry units at the METU Central Laboratory. One of the primary research interests in Dr. Ozen's group is  development and characterization of regulatory genetic elements..
Dr.Deniz YÜCEL
Dr. Yucel received her MSc and PhD degrees in Department of Biotechnology from Middle East Technical University.  She worked on enzyme/protein immobilization on polymeric materials and biosensors. She did her PhD on stem cell  based nerve tissue engineering on guided constructs. During her PhD she worked on mesenchymal stem cell  differentiation for one year at Massachusetts General Hospital and Tufts University. She is mainly interested in  biomaterials (2D and 3D polymeric material designs), tissue engineering and stem cell plasticity. She is currently  working as a Scientific Project Specialist at the Central Laboratory, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology R&D Center,  Middle East Technical University. She contributes to the IGEM team with her instrumental skills and her experience  in biochemistry and molecular biology.
Dr.Remziye YILMAZ
Remziye YILMAZ received her MSc and PhD degrees in Program of Biotechnology at the Food Engineering Department, University of Hacettepe. She then worked as founder in Biogenetic Laboratory of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, before joining the Molecular Biology and Biotechnology R&D Center of the Middle East Technical University. She started at METU in 2005 with a permanent position at the Genome Analysis Unit. She is proficient in gene expression techniques and assay development including microarray profiling and qPCR, also experienced in high-throughput data analysis of microarray results and experienced in working with genetically modified organisms. She is currently working as a research scientist at multidisciplinary projects. She contributes to the IGEM team with her expertise on molecular biology
