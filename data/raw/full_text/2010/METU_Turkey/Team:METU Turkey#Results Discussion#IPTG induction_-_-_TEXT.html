In expression comparison with IPTG concentration experiment, we realized that our CooA pTriEx vector is expressed without IPTG induction however when the cultures were induced with IPTG the expression incresed a little. Thus, we concluded that IPTG concentration doesn't much affect our expression yield. However, when 2mM IPTG was added to culture,expression of CooA was decreased. It has probably a toxic affect on our bacteria.
