From 2010.igem.org
MATERIALS
UV lamp - B58
Heat block - M3
Centrifuge - M8
CHECK-LIST PROCEDURE
GeneJET™ Gel Extraction Kit #K0692 procedure
NOTES
- Gel is cut under UV lamp.
- While the gel is being cut, it shouldn’t be exposed to UV much otherwise DNA mutations may occur and mutated DNA wouldn’t be appropriate to use in cloning.
- While cutting the gel, excess amount of gel should be removed.
- Before putting the gel piece into the eppendorf, empty eppendorf should be weight so that it can be omitted during the weighing of the gel.
- Before starting gel extraction, heat block should be set at 55C.
