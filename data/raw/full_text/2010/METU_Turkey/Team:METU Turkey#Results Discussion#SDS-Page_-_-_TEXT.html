TROUBLESHOOTINGS
Smear / GuHCl / Urea
Normally having 6M GuHCl or Urea will cause  a lot of band smearing and will not produce sharp bands on SDS -PAGE.
Alcohol or Acetone ppt. is suggested for proteins denatured by GuHCl or Urea for running on gels.
SDS
SDS should be added to all gels and the tank buffer at 0.1%. You can replace half the SDS in the Cathode buffer with 25 mg/l CBB-G250, then you can watch the protein bands during electrophoresis (Schägger et al., Anal. Biochem. 173 (1988) 201-5)
Separation of proteins with small MW difference
- Increase the gel % to upto 20%
- A longer SDS-PAGE apparatus, that will be of assistance as you can actually run the proteins out to a greater extent.
- A gradient gel is usefull if you want to separate small and large proteins on the same gel.
- Prepare the samples as usual, i.e. add Laemmli buffer or whatever you use, but leave out the SDS from the gel while preparing  it. Include SDS in the running buffer however. I have seen some appr. 10-kDa proteins that differ by 2 amino acids separate quite well under  these conditions. The gel % around 15-20...
Ghost (Double) Bands
Degradation
PMSF related > protease action > degradation
PMSF is not a very efficient protease inhibitor and if I am not mistaken it only works against serine proteases.
As a remedy, we can purchase and use a better protease inhibitor...
Oxidation Related
Reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or 2-mercaptoethanol cleave disulfide bonds into free sulfhydryl (SH) groups to allow proteins to unfold completely. However, the reducing agent can be oxidized during sample heating which may allow these disulfide bonds to reform, leading to the appearance of ghost bands in the high molecular weight area or precipitation at the sample application point.
Blocking the reduced SH groups can prevent disulfide bonds from reforming. One common way to do this is to alkylate with iodoacetamide. Iodoacetamide also alkylates residual DTT to prevent point-streaking and other artifacts in horizontal flatbed gels. The recommended amount of iodoacetamide is 2.0-2.5% (w/v) in the sample. The iodoacetamide should be added after boiling the reduced sample, but prior to loading the sample onto the SDS-PAGE gel. Alternatively, for first-dimension IPG strips, perform a second equilibration step for the IPG strips with an iodoacetamide solution in SDS equilibration buffer (without DTT). The alkylation reaction should take 15-20 minutes at room temperature.
