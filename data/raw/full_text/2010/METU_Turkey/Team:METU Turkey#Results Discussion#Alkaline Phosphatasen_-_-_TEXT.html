Team:METU Turkey/Results Discussion/Alkaline Phosphatasen
From 2010.igem.org
MATERIALS
________________________________________
- Heat block
- Spin
- Linear DNA
- 10X reaction buffer for AP used in reaction
- FastAP™ Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase
- Nuclease-free water
- P10 micropipette
CHECK-LIST PROCEDURE
________________________________________
- Prepare the following reaction mixture: Linear DNA (~3 kb plasmid) 1 μg (~1 pmol termini) 10X reaction buffer for AP used in reaction 2 μl FastAP™ Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase 1 μl (1 u) Water, nuclease-free (#R0581) to 20 μl Total volume 20 μl
- Mix thoroughly, spin briefly and incubate 10 min at 37°C.
- Stop reaction by heating for 5 min at 75°C.
NOTES
________________________________________
- For efficient dephosphorylation plasmid DNA should be free of RNA and genomic DNA.
- This protocol is suitable for removal of 3’ and 5’ -phosphate groups from DNA and RNA.
