Main Steps/Time Table
- Pre-culturing/5 hours
- Culturing/5 hours
- IPTG induction/15 hours
Materials
- LB medium with a suitable antibiotic
- TB medium with a suitable antibiotic
- IPTG
- 2-liter flask
- Incubator with shaker
- Centrifuge
Check List Procedure
- Culture transformed E.coli BL21 for 5 hrs at 37 C in 10 LB medium containing antibiotic
- Inoculate 4 ml pre-cultured cells into 400 ml of TB medium containing antibiotic in a 2-liter cultivation flask
- Culture it for 5 hrs at 37 C with a rotary shaker at 180 rpm!
- Add 0.5 mM IPTG in a final concentration
- Continue the cultivation for 15 hrs at 22 C.
- Harvest the cells with centrifuge.
Alternative Check List Procedure
- Inoculate single colony for 5 hrs at 37 C in 10 mL LB medium containing antibiotic
- Inoculate 4 ml pre-cultured cells into 400 ml of TB medium containing antibiotic in a 2-liter cultivation flask
- Culture it for 5 hrs at 37 C (OD600 to 0.5 - 0.6) with a rotary shaker at 180 rpm
- Add 1 mM IPTG in a final concentration ( 0.5- 2.0 mM recomended for pT7)
- Continue the cultivation for 3-4 h at 37 C (15 hrs at 22 C.)
- Harvest the cells with centrifuge.
Solutions
- TB (Terrific Broth) see Procedure [Media]
