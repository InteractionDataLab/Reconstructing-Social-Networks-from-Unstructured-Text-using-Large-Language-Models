(in Lab: HB, AV, JV)
Objective: To restrict pBAD, sRBS, mRBS, TetR, dT and pTet for the assembly of pBAD-sRBS-TetR-dT-pTet
Method: Used Restriction of Plasmid DNA protocol.
A front vector was made made in sRBS ,mRBS, dT plasmids using EcoRI and Xbal enzymes
pDNA that was cut out of plasmid for a front vector was pBAD, TetR, dT and pLacI using EcoRI and SpeI enzymes
A back vector was made in sRBS and mRBS plasmids with PstI and SpeI
pDNA that was cut out of plasmid for a back vector was TeTR and it was restricted with XbaI and PstI

Objective: Put lumazine synthase gene and mms6 into pET-28(A) for future overexpression.
Method: Restrict mms6 from Mr. Gene with NotI.  Large quantities of DNA can be used so a gel extraction of the part can be done.  PCR lumazine synthase out of its backbone.  Restrict off the extra DNA fragments from the PCR with NotI.  Restrict pET-28A with notI.  Ligate.

Added 45(µL) MM to each rxn tube.
Objective: Analyze tendency of PstI to be heat killed.
Hypothesis: Ligation will be counteracted by PstI digestion even following 20 minute heat kill at 80oC .
Method: Restrict plasmid DNA with PstI (and EcoRI control).  Reactions stopped by heat killing.  Plasmids re-ligated with T4 DNA Ligase.  Ligation confirmed with PCR.  If PCR product is present then enzyme heat killed but if there is no PCR Product then enzyme was not heat killed.

Analyzed PCR on 1% TAE agarose gel which ran for 60 min at 100 V.
Objective: Obtain new sources of pSB1T3, pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 plasmid backbone.  Backbone from registry used up.
Method: pSB1A3 can be obtained from anything team already possesses.  pSB1C3 can be obtained from BBa_J04450 (RFP) in kit.  Don't have tetracycline plates so cannot obtain pSB1T3.  Used competent cell transformation protocol.
