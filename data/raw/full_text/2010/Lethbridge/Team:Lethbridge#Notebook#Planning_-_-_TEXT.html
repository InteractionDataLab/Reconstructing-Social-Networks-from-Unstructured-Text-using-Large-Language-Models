Week of June 14/2010
Justin et al
Finish mms6-dT work
Heat kill ligase
take small sample for gel
take another sample for restriction (cut out entire biobrick)
Run gel of above
Transform into DH5α
Test T4 DNA Ligase:
Restrict rbs-xylE with EcoRI and SpeI (take sample for analysis on gel)
Heat kill EcoRI and SpeI
Ligate with T4 DNA Ligase
Run unrestricted, restricted and ligated samples on a gel.
Prepare plasmid DNA for sequencing
Adam to upload guidelines for preparation.
Test PCR conditions for confirmation of ligation via PCR:
Run a PCR of lumazine synthase gene that was sent for sequencing (and subsequently confirmed)
using VF2 and VR primers
Run this PCR on a 2% agarose gel
PCR Confirm previous ligations
If (AND ONLY IF) PCR conditions amplified our known lumazine synthase gene, set up PCR of our previous ligation reactions to see if there is any ligated product.
Adam
Finish VWR order (1000µL tips); test tubes; test tube racks; 96 well plates for sequencing, petri dishes
Get RMA for VWR order (ie wrong test tube and test tube racks)
Get guidelines for sequencing.
Make primers for inserting mms6, xylE, lumazine, (C and N terminal labelled CFP/YFP-maybe) into pET28a expression vectors.
No longer required.
Order polymerase, SpeI, NotI, and (maybe, depending on results) T4 DNA ligase from Fermentas.
Check with HJ's lab to see which polymerase they use and from whom.
Restrict lumazine, mms6, and xylE from BioBrick plasmid with NotI, and ligate into pET28a plasmid (pre-cut with NotI).
Check ligation and gel extract bands of proper size (Check for double insertion, plasmid self-ligation)
Transform into DH5α and purify plasmid DNA
Perform restriction analysis (using EcoRI and EcoRV) to check orientation of insert
Perform overexpression tests
Send for sequencing
