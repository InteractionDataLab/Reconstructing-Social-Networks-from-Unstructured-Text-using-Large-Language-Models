Compartmentalization Parts
One of the sub-projects for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds is to create synthetic microcompartments that we can then use to isolate various pathway within an Escherichia coli cell.  To do this we need to have a microcompartment as well as a means to characterize the compartment so that the system can be optimized.  The parts we have created so far are for the characterization of the microcompartment system.
