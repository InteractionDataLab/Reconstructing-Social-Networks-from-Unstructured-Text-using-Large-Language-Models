This page is to help everyone find the information that they need quickly and easily.  Happy browsing!
Gold Criteria
We took a closer look at the previously submitted xylE construct.  You can take a look at what we did on our Characterized Existing Parts page, our Results page and on the registry for part BBa_K118021 .
Take a look at our collaborations !
Silver Criteria
They worked!! Take a look at some of our new BioBrick parts that we made and characterized!  You can find them on our Characterized Parts page and our Results page.  These pages also have the link to the parts on the Registry.
Bronze Criteria
We had a SPECTACULAR summer!!  Check out our Artsmith and Publicity pages!
We are no doubt having fun at the Jamboree!
Come and check out our poster and presentation!  We love talking about our project and hearing alternate ways to approach it.
Definitely registered for the Jamboree.
Submitted the iGEM 2010 Judging form.
Have a look at our team's project description .  We have four subsections to our project; catechol degradation , compartmentalization , DNA degradation and magnetic nanoparticles .
Take a look at the list of parts we have designed and the 9 that we submitted.
We have submitted 9 new BioBricks to the registry along with entering their information.
Attribution and Contributions
The Lethbridge iGEM team declare there is no scientific overlap between our project and the projects of the advisors or instructors .  The undergraduates , in order to apply for the Oil Sands Initiative Grant , independently determined the benefits of using the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase for bioremediation of the tailings ponds.  We were ecstatic to receive the grant in May 2010.  The characterization and development of the project in the laboratory was done by the undergraduates with the supervision of the advisors and instructors as necessary.  All the information found within our wiki was done by the team's undergraduates with the exception of the Modelling which was carried out by the advisors and the Artsmith which was done primarily by or in collaboration with Anonymous Smith from our new media department at the University of Lethbridge.
Other Awesome Stuff!
Important Team Parts
Take a look at part BBa_K331030 , BBa_K331031 , and BBa_K331033 .  They are a few of the parts that we have characterized that you can find on our Characterized Parts and Results pages.
Human Practice
“Study the past, if you would divine the future” – Confucius
Scientific study is generally perceived as the development of new ideas and novel data, but underlying this is the fact that scientific advancement is made by building formerly known information on top of new innovation.  Indeed, without the discovery of the cell, synthetic biology would never exist.
In the same way that scientific advancements can be made by looking at prior invention, the Lethbridge iGEM Team believes that synthetic biology ethical advancements can also be made by looking at ethical concerns of the past.  Due to the fact that synthetic biology is such a new science, we are in the position to dictate ethical rules that should be implemented as new discoveries are made.
Lethbridge iGEM Team has chosen to look at significant scientific discoveries of the past and analyze them from ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social standpoints.  Learning how ethics has been dealt with (or should have been dealt with!) in the past can significantly shape the direction of ethical development in the field of synthetic biology.
Through our analysis of cloning, antibiotics, the steam engine, internet and nuclear power, the Lethbridge iGEM Team will “divine the future” of ethics and its relationship with the newly developing field of synthetic biology.
