May 13/2010 Evening(in lab: AS,TF,KG,JS,MC)
Objective: To make a second attempt at transforming plasmids that didn't transform the first time. These plasmids are:
Lumazine-dT (J5,J6)
pBad-TetR
sRBS (D5,E10)
C-term tag
pTet
All DH5α cells were used up in the last transformation, had to aliquot an additional 50x 20µL aliquots (MC,TF)
Transform plasmid DNA (Using "Competent Cell Transformation" Protocol) into newly aliquotted DH5α cells. (KG,JS)
NOTES:
AS concerned that there is something not quite right with LB liquid media added to transformed cells, but continued anyways (JV informed AS the next day that the LB liquid media had not been sterilized).
Plated all 250µL of culture.

Results:
May 25/2010
(in the lab:JV, HB, AV)
Objective: Transform the following ligated parts:
pLacI-sRBS (single cut from May 18,2010)
pLacI-sRBS (double cut from May 18,2010)
pLacI-sRBS-lumazine synthase-dt (from May 18, 2010)
Method:
Used Competent Cell Transformation to prepare plasmid DNA.
Results:
No colonies grew. No colonies on positive control plate. Something amiss here.
NOTE (June 1/2010; AS): Likely that the problem here was the method used to heat shock the cells. Cells were heat shocked in a heat plate, with incomplete contact of the heating surface, causing inefficient transfer of heat to cells for shock and movement of DNA into competent cells.

Conclusion: To be concluded....
Objective: Transform DH5α cells with plasmids containing ligation products from May 25/2010.
Method: Transform, using the competent cell transformation protocol, the ligation products with the most intense banding from each of the following ligation reactions:
mms6 + dT (B6 + A6)
xylE + dT (B4 + C4)
Incubate at 37oC overnight.
Results:
No colonies grew, even on positive control plate.
May 31/2010
Objective: Transform part BBa_J33204 (Ribosomal Binding Site + xylE gene) into DH5α cells.
Method:
Obtained part BBa_J33204 from 2010 iGEM Spring Distribution Kit Plate 1, well 7P.
Transformed using competent cell transformation protocol, along with negative control (milliQ H2O water) and positive control (pUC19 plasmid). Plated 100µL and 50µL on separate pre-warmed LB agar plates containing 100µg/mL ampicillin.
Added 250µL of SOC media and incubated for 90 minutes at 37o.
Results:
Obtained the following number of colonies on each plate:
BBa_J33204 50µL - 13 colonies
BBa_J33204 100µL - 18 colonies
pUC19 - 9 colonies
Other lab activities:
Inoculated 5mL of LB liquid broth (Amp+ with cells containing Bba_J33204 picked from colony off transformation plate and incubated at 37oC with shaking overnight.
AV quantified each pDNA stock in the working plasmids box by measuring the A260 of a 1:100 dilution of the pDNA samples in a UV cuvette. Results are posted on the working plasmids page.
May 31/2010 - Evening
Objective: Transform recent ligation reactions that didn't work the first time around.
Method: Use competent cell transformation protocol to transform the following ligation products:
pLacI + sRBS
pLacI + sRBS-Lum-dT (times 2)
mms6 (B6) + dT
mms6 (A6) + dT
xylE (C4) + dT
xylE (B4) + dT
Plated all cells; spun down media so cells were pelleted and removed 200uL of cell-free media. Re-suspended pelleted cells in remaining media, and plated onto ampicillin plates.
Results:
No growth on plates EXCEPT:
Positive control (pUC19) - 9 colonies
mms6 (B6) + dT - 1 colonies
