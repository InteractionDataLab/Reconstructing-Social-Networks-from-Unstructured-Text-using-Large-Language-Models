In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing tennis. I can draw fairly well; however, I have not picked up a drawing pencil in a few years. In fact, my picture is a self portrait I did in my senior year of high school. I have always enjoyed science and believe that iGEM is a great way to expose myself to the new expanding field of synthetic biology while gaining some lab experience along the way.“    </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Josh_Sorell"><FONT color="white">Josh Sorell</FONT></SPAN></H2><P>&quot;I grew up in the magnificent city of Calgary where wild people roam and animals sit civilized. Then promptly at the age of 19, I began academicizing at the center for academics, the University of Lethbridge. I left my established abode for this center; for it gave me credit for the AP courses I took at William Aberhart High School and had small class sizes. I am studying biochemistry and am in my 3rd year, of which aquatic biology actually was my favorite class because I had the opportunity to learn so many specifics about North American aquatic organisms. What I hope to get out of the iGEM experience is knowledge about molecular biology and satisfaction on how I helped forward the field of synthetic biology. In my free time I play Starcraft 2 from Blizzard Entertainment, subsidiary of Activision and also try to build sweet devices like a tesla coil.

This is my first year on the school iGEM team and I am fulling enjoying it. I am from Lethbridge and my goal in life is to become a doctor. My biggest fears include; papercuts, centipedes, anything to do with running naked, and a world without chocolate.

Obviously I really enjoy being part of this group and I am excited to head up the fundraising and ethics committees. I just graduated with my neuroscience degree and am looking forward to a year of traveling through Central America. I plan to learn a new language, volunteer in as many countries as possible and make some new friends.

Aside from school commitments, iGEM and a deep fascination for translation factors (namely EF-Tu), I thoroughly enjoy playing a quick game of chess and numerous sports; I am an avid long jumper on the University of Lethbridge Track and Field team.

This dream was to produce a son who would go on to contribute to the invigorating field of synthetic biology. On a beautiful morning in a time very similar the year of 1991, this dream, of a not yet existent field of science, took root with the birth of a son. He was known throughout the land as Tyler Forster. For many years, the dream lay low as it gathered force. In a year very similar to 2010, the time had come for the dream's full power to be displayed, and so Tyler got involved with iGEM while in his first year at a very similar institution to the University of Lethbridge. As part of the master plan, Tyler's parents subconsciously interested him into bird-watching, soccer, volleyball and especially basketball. Although the story is far from over, the rest of the story has yet to play out. And so dear children, I will leave you to sleep in peace, secure in the knowledge that greater things are still to be done in this city. *To be continued, but probably not*</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Graduate_Students"><FONT color="white">Graduate Students</FONT></SPAN></H1><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Adam_Smith_-_Lab_Technician"><FONT color="white">Adam Smith - Lab Technician</FONT></SPAN></H2><P>Adam Smith moved to Lethbridge in September of 2001 to study Biochemistry at the University of Lethbridge.

I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
