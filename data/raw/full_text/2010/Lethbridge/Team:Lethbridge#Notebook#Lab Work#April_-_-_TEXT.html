(*)Star Activity
(**)Optimal Buffer from Fermentas
Use pUC19 plasmid as test, it has cut sites for EcoRI, PstI, XbaI (unsure about BcuI/SpeI, DpnI but will try anyways), and none for EcoRV
Red Buffer: EcoRI, PstI, Control (No Enzyme)
Tango Buffer: BcuI/SpeI, XbaI, DpnI, Control (No Enzyme)
Methods: Set up Master Mixes:
Red MM

Red Buffer (10x)

To each tube, add 19.75µL of master mix and 0.25µL of enzyme
Incubated reaction mixes at 37oC (Start:7:00pm; End:7:45pm)
Add 3.3µL of 6x loading dye to each reaction mixture and load 10µL final volume onto a 1% agarose (in TAE) gel.
Add 1µL of 6x loading dye to 1µL of GeneRuler 1kb ladder (at 0.5µg/µL)
Gel loading order as follows:
Lane
Sample
1
1kb Ladder
2
Tango Control
3
DpnI (Tango)
4
BcuI/SpeI (Tango)
5
XbaI (Tango)
6
EcoRI (Red)
7
PstI (Red)
8
Red Control
9
Empty
10
Empty
Ran gel at 100V for 1 hour
Results: pUC19 plasmid DNA not present at a high enough concentration to visualize by ethidium bromide staining (1kb ladder did stain).
Conclusion: Will have to re-run experiment with DNA that is present at high enough concentrations to visualize by ethidium bromide staining
