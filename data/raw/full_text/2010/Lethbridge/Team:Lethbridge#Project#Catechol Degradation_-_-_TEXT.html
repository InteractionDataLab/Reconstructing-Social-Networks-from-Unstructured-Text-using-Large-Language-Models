Catechol Degradation
Our home province, Alberta, has proven oil reserves of 171.3 billion barrels.  These reserves make up the second-largest proven crude oil reserve in the world.  This is enough oil to meet Canada’s current oil demand for almost 400 years1.  The oil reserves are in the form of tar sands: a sand, clay, water, and bitumen mixture2.  The bitumen is separated from the sticky tar sand by washing it with hot water.  The heated water acquires toxins from the tar sands: resulting in an environmental issue.
Catechol is a toxic organic molecule commonly found in tailings ponds.  Furthermore, many other toxic compounds, such as naphthenic acids, can be metabolized into catechol. Pseudomonas putida demonstrates great metabolic diversity and is able to utilize a wide range of carbon sources, including molecules few other organisms can break down3.  The Lethbridge 2008 iGEM isolated the xylE gene ( BBa_K147002 ) from P.putida, which codes for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE).  However, the Edinburgh 2008 iGEM team isolated the xylE gene ( BBa_K118021 ) from P.putida, along with a ribosomal binding site (rbs), so we chose to work with this part.  This year we have engineered Escherichia coli DH5αto express xylE.  xylE rapidly converts catechol into 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2-HMS).  2-HMS is a non-toxic, bright yellow molecule that can be metalbolized by E.coli DH5α.

We will then use our lumazine synthase (LS) microcompartment to isolate the xylE protein.  The LS has been previously characterized and shown that it is able to encapsulate other molecules.  We can target a protein into the LS through selectively mutating five of the interior amino acids of the LS to glutamate.  By attaching a positively charged arginine tag to the C-terminus of the protein for targeting you can selectively target the tagged protein into the compartment ( Lethbridge 2009 Modeling ) (Seebeck et al., 2006).  We will then purify the complex and use for application in tailings ponds water.  Once we have demonstrated that we are successfully able to isolate the xylE we will then add more enzymes for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds.
