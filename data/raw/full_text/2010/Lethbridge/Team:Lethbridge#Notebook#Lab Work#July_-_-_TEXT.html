Results:
July 5/2010 Evening
Objective: To over-express CFP complete in DH5α
Method:
1) Inoculated 6mL culture with ampicillin and glycerol stock A6-May 13,2010 CFP complete 2) Went in the shaker at 6:50pm
July 6/2010
(In lab: JV, AV, HB)
Objective: To continue the over-expression of CFP complete in DH5α
Method:
1) Put both cultures (taken out of shaker at 9:15am) and put them in 500mL of LB w/ Amp.
2) initial OD was 0.071 (600λ)
Issue:
After checking the the sequencing it was evident that our promotor is always off. It is turned off by the product of the gene TetR. Which is not part of our construct.

Method: A restriction digest was performed on xylE and Mms6 and ran for 90 minutes at 37 C
Results:Did not see any cut out biobricks.
July 27, 2010
(in lab: JV, AV, HB)
Objective: To miniprep the overnight cultures of the parts ordered from the Parts Registry and to test the efficiency of the Qiagen Miniprep Kit.
Method:
The following parts were miniprep'd using Boiling Lysis Plasmid Preparation :
dT (control)
E0020 (ECFP)
E0030 (EYFP)
K249001
K249004
K249005
K249006
K249008
K249014
K249017
The following parts were miniprep'd using Qiagen Miniprep Kit:
K249005
K249008
Results: Qiagen Miniprep Kit produced a comparable quantity of DNA to Boiling Lysis Plasmid Preparation . Since the Qiagen Miniprep Kit is faster and easier, all minipreps will be done using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit.
July 28, 2010
(in lab: JV)
Objective: To create a large quantity of pSB1C3 plasmid.
Method: PCR amplified pSB1C3 received from iGEM headquarters.
July 29, 2010
(in lab: HB, AV)
Objective: To PCR amplify the minipreps on July 27, 2010.
Method: PCR amplified the 11 minipreps and dT control.
Results: PCR amplification was successful and 0.2 µL of polymerase will be used per PCR reaction in the future.
Objective: To maxiprep EYFP (E0030), ECFP (E0020), and Lumazine Synthase (K249002).
Method: Used Maxiprep
Cell Pellet
Weight (g)
ECFP
2.32

July 29, 2010 Evening
(in lab: KG)
Objective: Run PCR products from the morning on a 2% agarose gel.
Method: Ran 2% agarose gel of the 11 minipreps and dT control and stained in EtBr for 17 minutes.
Results:PCR amplification of last year's parts not consistent with sizes listed on registry.
