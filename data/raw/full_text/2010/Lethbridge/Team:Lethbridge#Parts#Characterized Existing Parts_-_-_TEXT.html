Catechol Degradation
The focus of our project is to decrease the toxicity of tailing pond water through bioremediation. We are specifically interested in the degradation of the toxic molecule catechol into 2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde (2-HMS); a bright yellow substrate that can be metabolized by the cell. This conversion is accomplished by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (xylE).
Characterized Parts
You can view BBa_K118021 on the registry and find the experimental data on our Results page.
Compartmentalization Parts
One of the sub-projects for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds is to create synthetic microcompartments that we can then use to isolate various pathways within an Escherichia coli cell.  To do this we need to have a microcompartment as well as a means to characterize the compartment so the system can be optimized.  These parts we have received directly from the Registry and were further characterized for future use in characterization of the microcompartment system.
N-terminal Arginine Fusion Vector
You can view BBa_K249004 on the registry and find the experimental details on our Results page.
C-terminal Arginine Fusion Vector
You can view BBa_K249005 on the registry and find the experimental details on our Results page.
Magnetic Nanoparticles Parts
One of the sub-projects for the bioremediation of the tailings ponds is to reduce heavy metals to create magnetic nanoparticles that can then be removed from the pond.  To do this we need to be able to produce Mms6 (the iron reducing protein) and show that it can successfully produce the nanoparticles within the Escherichia coli cell.  He is the work we have accomplished so far to characterize Mms6.
Mms6 (Nanoparticles)
You can view BBa_K249019 on the registry and find the experimental details on our Results page.
