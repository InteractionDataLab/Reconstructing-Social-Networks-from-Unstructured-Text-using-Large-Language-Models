Advisors
Paul Jones - Hons student in Synthetic Biology
Damian D'Souza - PhD student in Protein Chemistry
Undergraduates:
Ebony Perkins: Former chem eng student now studying biotechnology. Outside science, my main interests are theatre and travelling. Places I've visited include Japan, New Zealand and Vanuatu.
Sebastian Ramov: I have participated in iGEM 2009 and it rocked so I am back here again to rock MIT. I believe that with synthetic biology we can revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and science in general. I cant wait to graduate and enter the work force.
Michelle Chayeb: This is my second year in iGEM and I had a great experience from 2009. I am studying     pharmaceutical science and am interested in the pharmaceutical industry concerning research and development/design.
Danni Kamato: This is my second year in iGEM, really enjoyed the challenge and experience last year, loved working in the lab on something I'm interested in and can't wait to do it over this year.
Tirath Singh: Currently studying Pharmaceutical Science at RMIT; first time participant in the iGEM project. I am interested in the application of potential genetic therapies in combating disease, in combination with traditional Pharmaceutical therapies and how new developments in synthetic biology can combine these two areas.
Karen Lee: I am a new member of the iGEM team and it has been very interesting and informative for me. My interest is in toxins from snakes, spiders , plants and any other forms that have chemicals that can potentially be used in medicine .Another interest of mine includes microorganisms and our capability to manipulate their characteristics genetically.iGEM has provided me an opportunity to gain an insight into genetic manipulation techniques.
Hiwot Kelemwork: this is my first year doing iGEM, i am exited to be part of this great expierence and have gained a great deal of knoweledge through my participation. i am currently in my 3rd year of biomedical science.

Where we're from
Our team comes from RMIT University in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
RMIT University Melbourne
The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University is one of Australia’s leading educational institutions, producing some of Australia’s most employable graduates.
As an innovative, global University of technology, RMIT has an international reputation for excellence in work-relevant education and high quality research.
It has built a worldwide reputation for excellence in professional and vocational education and research. A vibrant alumni community now stretches across more than 100 countries.
RMIT is also a member of the Australian Technology Network (ATN). The ATN is a coalition of five Australian Universities that share a common focus on the practical application of tertiary studies and research as a framework of flexibility and innovation. The focus of the ATN is to produce graduates and research that is closely aligned to the needs of industry and the wider society. The ATN Universities share a common background in the way they distinguished themselves as technical colleges before becoming accredited Universities.

Melbourne, Australia
There is a lot to love about Melbourne. This sophisticated world city is in the south-eastern corner of mainland Australia.
Melbourne is very much about lifestyle. It is no huge surprise to residents that their city has been ranked as one of the world’s most livable cities.
Melbournians love the city's vibrant energy, restaurants, fashion boutiques, café-filled laneways, cool bars, unbeatable galleries, spacious parks and village-like inner suburbs, each with its own special character.
Melbourne is less than 200 years old and never sits still. Modern, cutting-edge designs add to the fascinating mix of heritage architecture and ensure the skyline is constantly changing.
