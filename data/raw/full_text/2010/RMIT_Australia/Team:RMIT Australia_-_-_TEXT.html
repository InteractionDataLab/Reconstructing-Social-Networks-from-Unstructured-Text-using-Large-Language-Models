RMIT IGEM Team 2010
Hello from RMIT!
RMIT is located in Melbourne, Australia and thus far it looks like the team will consist of students studying biotechnology and pharmaceutical sciences, possibly bringing on board some chemical engineering students as well. Watch this space!
Project Summary The objective for our iGEM 2010 team is to create a biological system that will produce a peptide at a low economic cost. This machine includes the use of a bacterial plasmid (vector) that will incorporate a T7 promoter under control of lac elements to express a soluble theromostable protein carrier molecule to allow for sufficient production of the peptide that will be added to the vector by a process of ligation-independent cloning. The peptide will be separable by thermal release from the carrier protein for simple bioprocessing and process intensification. We believe that this system can then be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag associated with its manufacture and development to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research or treatment.
Collaborations
The RMIT 2010 iGEM team is collaborating with Penn state University in their Human Practices Survey.
