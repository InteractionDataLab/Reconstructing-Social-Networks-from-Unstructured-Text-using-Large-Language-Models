Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of
researcher safety?
No, all experiments were conducted in a manner that followed Cornell safety rules.
environmental safety?
No, since experiments are conducted in a controlled environment and wastes were collected in a separate waste. Cornell Environmental Health and Safety was responsible for removing waste in an appropriate way.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, the Cornell Engineering Project Team Board.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
They approve of our project as long as we follow general proper laboratory team safety rules.  Each project team member is required to attend a safety presentation every year to be trained on lab safety rules.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, they are not hazardous
