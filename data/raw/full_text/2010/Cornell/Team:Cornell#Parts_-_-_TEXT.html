Parts
BBa_K399000:  mHoneydew coding sequence.  When attached to a promoter, it can be used as a reporter and will fluoresce light green.
BBa_K399001:  mStrawberry coding sequence.  When attached to a promoter, it can be used as a reporter and will fluoresce light pink.
BBa_K399002:  mTangerine coding sequence.  When attached to a promoter, it can be used as a reporter and will fluoresce light orange.
Parts to be Completed
The ClyA BioBrick will be completed once we have inserted the coding sequence into the appropriate plasmid backbone.
Additionally, reporter devices will be made once we attach the pTet promoter and RBS to the fluorescent protein parts mentioned above.
