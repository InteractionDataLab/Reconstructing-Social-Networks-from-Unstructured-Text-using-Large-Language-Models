Plated NT Cells Immediately after Transformation
Plated Transformed NT Cells after about 3 weeks of Cell Growth
rd29A + RFP Transformed NT Cells after about 3 weeks of growth: The NT cells shown above were transformed with rd29A+RFP, a composite part in which the rd29A promoter is turned on due to external stimuli such as cold, drought or salinity. When the rd29A promoter is turned "on" it then turns on its reporter, in this case RFP. After about 3 weeks of NT cell growth, the transformed cells were "cold stressed" for about 3hrs in 4 degrees Celsius. The results shown indicate that when cold stressed, the transformed NT cells become fluorescent with RFP. Over the next few weeks we hope to see this signal grow stronger and test these NT cells' responsiveness to other stresses that induce the rd29A promoter.
35S + GFP Transformed NT Cells: Currently, our transformed NT cells that contain the composite part, 35S + GFP, have not grow enough to determine whether or not the transformation was successful. The 35S promoter was designed as a constitutive control and would always be turned "on", thus maintaining a constant GFP fluorescent signal. Over the next few weeks we hope to see more cell growth and eventually transformed cells that produce green fluorescent protein constitutively.
