RD29A Promoter + Strong Plant Kozak (RBS) + RFP Team:Nevada/registry submissions
In our project, we designed the rd29A Promoter and the rd29A Promoter + Strong Plant Kozak (RBS) + RFP. These both came from the synthetic design that contained the rd29A Promoter + Strong Plant Kozak (RBS) + RFP in the pMA vector. The rd29A promoter was isolated by the use of the rd29A designed primers in PCR. This was blunt end Topo cloned, digested with EcoR 1 and Pst 1 sites, and was then ligated to the pSB1C3 vector. The design of the rd29A Promoter + Strong Plant Kozak (RBS) + RFP involved the ligation to the pSB1C3 vector using the EcoR 1 and Pst 1 sites. This composite part contains both the promoter and the reporter gene. This functions when the promoter is activated during environmental stress, which would then allow the expression of red fluorescence in plants that can be used as a warning signal to farmers that their plants are under stress.
