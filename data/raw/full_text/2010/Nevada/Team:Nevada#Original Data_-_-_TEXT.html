Boolean Values (Threshold of 2.0)
Values from the log base 2 table which were greater than or equal to a 2.0-fold increase were assigned values of 1 ( "on" ) and values under 3.5 were assigned values of 0 ( "off" ).

Boolean Input Functions
The number of Boolean inputs for this data amounted to 20 megabytes worth of text files, and thus, has been omitted.  The extremely large number of inputs going into each gene indicated that the process needed some refinement to limit the number of possible interactions between these genes.  This lead to the data interpolation and limiting the Boolean inputs to being no greater than 4 for each gene.
For some examples of Boolean Input Functions, please see the interpolated data page.
