DREB1C promoter Team:Nevada/registry submissions
The DREB1C iGEM promoter is derived from a transcription factor that is up-regulated by cold stress and down-regulated by circadian controls to prevent plant growth retardation due to the buildup of DREB1C (Dehydration Response Element Binding Protein) during the day (the cause of dwarfism). The promoter region for DREB1C begins just upstream of the translational start sequence (ATG) and contains 463 bp of the upstream sequence with six ADA independent, cis-acting elements for the up-regulation during cold stress and circadian controlled down-regulation.
The DREB1C iGEM promoter was isolated using custom primers directly from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome via PCR, blunt end Topo cloned, and then ligated to pSB1C3 using EcoR1 and Pst1 sites.
