Project Details
Stess-inducible plant promoters will be linked to a fluorescent reporter gene. Once the plasmid is transformed into NT cells the cells can then be stressed and placed in a fluorometer to reveal real-time induction of the promoter by observing the increase in fluorescent intensity of a line of NT cells over time.
