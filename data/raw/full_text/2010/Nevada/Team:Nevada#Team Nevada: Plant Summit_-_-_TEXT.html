2010 iGEM Plant Summit
On Sunday November 7th, the iGEM Nevada Team is organizing the first iGEM Plant Summit. The goal of this summit is to develop a network of iGEM investigators working on plant systems that can help promote the adoption of plants by the larger iGEM community. We will discuss the initiation of a coordinated effort to develop iGEM compatible resources (i.e. plant promoters, reporter genes, and transformation vectors) and standardized plant transformation, maintenance and safety protocols. The pros and cons of various plant systems will be discussed. Furthermore, because, genetically engineered plants require more time to create than genetically engineered bacteria or fungi, we will also discuss strategies that will allow for the completion of plant related projects within the time constraint of the iGEM competition.
