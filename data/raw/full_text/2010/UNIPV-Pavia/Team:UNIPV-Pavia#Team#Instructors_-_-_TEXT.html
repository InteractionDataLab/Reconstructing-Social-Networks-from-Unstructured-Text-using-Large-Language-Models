Personal
I am 41 years old. I am the promoter of the iGEM competition in Pavia. I am an enthusiastic fan of this competition! I think that it represents a big opportunity for a student. I have selected our best students from Biology, Biotechnology and Bioengineering programs and I tried to build a team. Even if I have spent a lot of time in this initiative, I am very happy to partecipate to iGEM 2010 and to have worked with all of them.
For 20 years, I was a national referee of Handball. I like skiing and ... teaching to those students that want to learn :-)
