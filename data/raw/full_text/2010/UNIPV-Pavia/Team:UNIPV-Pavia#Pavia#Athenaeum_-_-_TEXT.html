ATHENAEUM
The University of Pavia is one of the oldest universities in Europe. An edict issued by King Lotarius quotes a higher education institution in Pavia as already established in 825 A.D. This institution, mainly devoted to ecclesiastical and civil law as well as to theological studies, was then elected as the prime educational centre for northern Italy. Enlarged and renovated by the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, it became the University of the Duchy, having been officially established as a studium generale by Emperor Charles IV in 1361.
During the following centuries, even though passing through periods of both adversity and prosperity, the fame of the University of Pavia grew and not just in Italy. The continuous presence of learned men and scientists who wrote celebrated works and made important discoveries, such as Girolamo Cardano , Alessandro Volta , Camillo Golgi , Ugo Foscolo together with the distinguished educational record of the University, added to the good name of the institution.
Nowadays, the University keeps on offering a wide variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary teaching. About 22.000 students follow the courses in Pavia. Research is carried out in departments, institutes, clinics, centres and laboratories, in close association with public and private institutions, enterprises, and factories.
These are the 9 faculties in which the university is divided into:
Faculty of Economics
Faculty of Engineering
Faculty of Humanities
Faculty of Law
Faculty of Physical, Natural and Mathematical Sciences
Faculty of Medicine
Faculty of Musicology
Faculty of Pharmacy
Faculty of Politics
Pavia is famous for the colleges, which are a quite unique feature of this university city. Merit-based colleges are: the Ghislieri College, the Borromeo College, the Nuovo College and the Santa Caterina College, while public colleges belong to the EDiSU. We have fun with sport events and all colleges have their own traditions.
Selected students in Pavia can take classes also at the IUSS (Institute for Advanced Studies), shaped according to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa model, which reunites all the colleges of the Pavia Study System.
