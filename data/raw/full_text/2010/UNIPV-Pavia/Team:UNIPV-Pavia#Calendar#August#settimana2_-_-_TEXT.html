AUGUST: WEEK 2
August, 9th
Phasins plates showed very few colonies (12 for I20-new and 17 for I21-new): they were all picked and let grow in LB+Amp 100ug/ml. In the evening we made glycerol stocks and re-filled the tubes for the screening of the following day:
I20-new:
I20-1
I20-2
I20-3
I20-4
I20-5
I20-6
I20-7

In order not to loose our time we decided to perform again the PCR-amplification/modification of <partinfo>BBa_K208001</partinfo> in case of a negative screening. Than we gel-ran and gel-extracted right amplicons. PCR was performed with:
10_F and S_R primers
S_F and S_R primers
PCR results: PhaP 10-S and PhaP S-S
The image shows results of our PCR: both amplicons are positive, so we purified cut DNA, obtaining the following quantifications:
PhaP 10-S: 16,8 ng/ul
PhaP S-S: 17,1 ng/ul
Tomorrow we will proceed to digest this part, in order to have an alternative if all clones of I20 and I21 are negative.
In the afternoon, we inoculated all parts we will need tomorrow.

Check of LB+Cm 6 ug/ml agar plates. We let grow at 30°C:
MG1655 in LB
MC1061 in LB
MG123/008 in LB+Amp 50 ug/ml
MC123/008 in LB+Amp 50 ug/ml
F2620-4C5 (positive control)
Than we streaked cultures on a seven-sector divided plate, and we let it grow ON at 30°C. Since 6 ug/ml is a very low concentration, we wanted to check if actually nothing (except F2620-4C5) grows on these plates.
Transformation at 30°C of 100 ul of MG123/008 and MC123/008 competent cells to check their efficiency. We used 1 ul (~4 ng) of RING, F2620-4C5, NOTHING (water) and plated on proper LB agar plates:
RING: Cm 34 ug/ml
F2620-4C5 (positive control): Cm 12,5 ug/ml
NOTHING (negative control): Cm 12,5 ug/ml
Both F2620-4C5 and RING should survive (not RING when in XX123), but we had a problem so that MC008 transformed with RING couldn't be plated. We will check it another time. We let grow plates ON, 30°C.

Digestions were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. A big gel and 2 medium gel were prepared, samples were loaded and gel ran/cut.
Up: Screening for I20-1..12 (PhaP 10-S (X-P)): all colonies are negative :( Down: Screening for I21-1..14 (PhaP S-S (X-P)): all colonies are negative, except for I21-4 gel run/cut and purified (we ran gel again after the cut).
Screening for I21-15..17, I22, I23 and I15-1. The three colonies of I21 were negative, I22 and I23 were positive, so they were excided and purified. I15-1 was excided, even if extra-bands were observed. We use it for ligation because sequencing is ok!
Ent4C5, <partinfo>BBa_B0034</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K105012</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_R0062</partinfo> were extracted and purified. Also PhaP 10-S (X-S) and PhaP S-S (X-S) were extracted and purified, in order to repeat the ligation with a vector, since one only colony was positive for I21 and no colony was positive for I20. <partinfo>pSB1AK3</partinfo> vector cut X-S was also gel extracted and purified.
After purification, digested DNA was quantified as follows:

Ligations were incubated ON at 16°C and tomorrow will be transformed.
Colonies transformed with RING, F2620-4C5, Nothing and plated on proper agar plates were still too little to check efficiency of MC123/008 and MG123/008 competent cells. So we let them grow another day and night at 30°C.

So we decided to store plates at +4°C (in order to calculate efficiency in the next days) and to repeat transformation for
MC008: F2620-4C5 (Cm 12,5 ug/ml), RING (Cm 34 ug/ml)
MG123: F2620-4C5 (Cm 12,5 ug/ml), RING (Cm 34 ug/ml), NOTHING (12,5 ug/ml)
We transformed 1 ul (~4 ng of DNA) and plates were let grow at 30°C for about twenty hours.
Results for our test with Cm 6 ug/ml agar plates:
Test-plate Cm 6 ug/ml: F2620-4C5 is the positive control
As you can see not only positive control F2620-4C5 grew but also very small colonies for MG1655, MG123, MC008.

This morning we checked if our plates were grown. I24 showed many colonies, just like I26.  I15_4C5 showed 3 colonies. I20_M and I21_M showed many colonies
3 colonies of I24 were picked and incubated in 1 ml LB+Amp. After 6hours glycerol stock was prepared and falcon tubes were re-filled with 5ml LB+Amp in order to perform a screening tomorrow. All 3 colonies of I15_4C5 were picked and incubated in 1 ml LB+Cm 12,5. They were stocked, too, and refilled for further screening.
Today we decided to perform a massive screening for phasins. For this reason, we decided to perform a colony PCR for:

For these cultures an inoculum was performed in 6ml LB+Amp. Tomorrow we will prepare glycerol stocks for them and we will perform a further screening, with an X-P digestion in order to see if the insert was ligated in the right direction.
Glycerol stock was prepared for:
I15_4C5-1
I15_4C5-2
I15_4C5-3
I24-1
I24-2
I24-3
and falcon tubes were re-filled with fresh LB added with proper antibiotic. Tomorrow MiniPrep will be performed for also these cultures and plasmids will be digested and gel run.
Only MC008 transformed with RING was grown, so we stored it at +4°C with the other transformed plates and let the others grow at 30°C. We would have calculated the transformation efficiency for all plates together.
MC008 transformed again with RING (OK)

Today Mr.Gene came to visit and he brought us two beautiful gifts: Intein and CREAM !! They were stored at +4°C.
Here the last four plates of efficiency test:
MC008 transformed again with F2620-4C5 (OK, but badly plated)
MG123 transformed again with F2620_4C5 (OK)
MG123 transformed again with RING (OK)
MG123 transformed again with NOTHING (OK)
We calculated (thanks Alessandro, Chiara, Riccardo) efficiency of our home-made competent cells MC123/008 and MG123/008 (#colonies/ug DNA):
