Digestion was performed at 37°C for 3 hours. Digestions were gel run. For I9 and I10 clones all colonies were correct, while for I7 and I8 extra bands could be observed. Since preliminar results of TECAN test didn't provide encouraging results, we decided to select other 3 colonies both for I7 and I8 and to repeat the screening, while I9 and I10 were correct at this screening, so we chose I9-1 and I10-1 as definitive I9 and I10 parts. I9 and I10 will be further screened next week.
TECAN TEST
Screening of I7, I8, I9, I10
PhaP-1 and PhaP-2 were prepared or sequencing: 13,8 ul (2x quantity) of PhaP-1 and 14,7ul (1x quantity) of PhaP-2 were dryed at 65°C and sent to BMR genomics for sequencing service.
All strains received from Yale Univesity were on blotting paper disks, that were placed on an LB agar plates (with/without antiobiotic, see growth conditions), resuspended with 80ul LB and then streaked. After plate streaking, disks were transferred in falcon tubes containing liquid LB.
BT340 was streaked on LB+Amp (50ng/ml) agar plates and from here on LB+Amp (100ng/ml) agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB+Amp (100ng/ml).
BW5328 was streaked on LB+Amp (50ng/ml) agar plates and from here on LB+Amp (100ng/ml) agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB+Amp (100ng/ml).
MG1655 was streaked on LB agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB.
MC1061 was streaked on LB agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB.
BW25142 was streaked on LB agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB.
BW25141 was streaked on LB agar plates. The paper disk was then transferred in liquid LB.

CGSC strains streaked the previous day:
BT340/pCP20 grew on both LB+Amp at 50ug/ml and 100 ug/ml
BW5328/pAH123 did not grow in LB+Amp at 50ug/ml, LB+Amp at 100 ug/ml (also the liquid culture containing the disk appeared clear)
MG1655, MC1061, BW25142 and BW25141 grew on LB plates.
We requested another disk for BW5328/pAH123 to CGSC, while the working strains plates were stored at +4°C.
Inoculum of cultures for a TECAN test. From glycerol stocks: I7-1, I7-2, I8-1, I8-2 (all tese 4 colonies were not correct! we want to see if any fluorescence is observed in order to understamd if there is any unexpected GFP production), I9-1, I9-2, I10-1, I10-2. For these cultures 8ul of glycerol stock were inoculated in 2 ml Lb+Amp. Other three colonies were picked from I7 and I8 plates.

All cultures incubated yesterday night were diluted 1:100 (10ul in 1ml fresh LB+Amp) and let grown for further 3 hours at 37°C 220 rpm. Also I7-3,4 and 5 and I8-3, 4 and 5 were prepared for TECAN test (10ul were diluted in 1ml LB+Amp). After dilution, static OD was measured for these cultures and a proper dilution was perfeormed, in order to start from the desired OD of 0.02, according to the formula:
After dilution, 3 aliquotes each of 200ul were transferred in a 96-wells plate and incubated in TECAN multi-well plate reader. Cultures were incubated at 37°C and a kinetic cycle was performed:
Duration: 20h
Kinetic cycle: 5 minutes
Every 5 minutes:
15 s shaking (3mm, linear)
10 s wait
OD600 measurement
GFP measurement
I7-3, I7-4, I7-5, I8-3, I8-4 and I8-5 cultures were prepared in 5ml LB+Amp, so the remaining cultures not used for TECAN test were pelletted at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, supernatant was discarded and pelletes were stored at 4°C for tomorrow MiniPrep of cultures that provided promising results at TECAN test.
Of the plates incubated yesterday, a colony was picked and grown in 1ml LB (+ antibiotic) for 6 hours at 37°C 220 rpm:

As reported in the table above, BT340/pCP20 was inoculated in LB+Amp(100 ug/ml)+Cm(12.5 ug/ml) to validate the second selection marker of pCP20 and it grew as expected.
Other parts were received from Anderson Lab. in stab form.

TECAN test provided encouraging results, showing that I7-3, I7-5, I8-4 and I8-5 produced GFP. Also I9-1, I9-2, I10-1 and I10-2 confirmed the preliminar results of the precious test, in fact GFP production was observe. At a preliminary analysis, it seems that GFP production is correlated to the srength of the promoter regulating luxI production!! :) Other culture (I7-1, I7-2, I7-4, I8-1, I8-2, I8-3) did not produce GFP, so they were thrown away. A furhter screening were performed on I7-3, I7-5, I8-4, I8-5, I9-1 and I10-1.
For this reason, MiniPrep was performed for the following colonies, with the following quantiications:
I7-3
107,7 ng/ul
I7-5
55,4 ng/ul
I8-4
94,5 ng/ul
I8-5
118,3 ng/ul
I7-3, I7-5, I8-4 and I8-5  were digested with EcorI and PstI. All colonies were digested with NheI-PstI (2 NheI sites are present in the BBa_J23xx promoter, so this digestion shows if the promoter has been ligated.)
