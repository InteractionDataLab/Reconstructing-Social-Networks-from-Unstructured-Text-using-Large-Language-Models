JULY: WEEK 2
July, 5th
LB agar plates prepared:
LB+Amp 100 (500ml)
LB+Cm 34 (500ml)
LB (250ml)
LB+Cm 12.5 (250ml)

July, 6th
We decided to perform a TECAN test to evaluate the strength of some promoters belonging to the Anderson Promoters Collection. Inoculum from glycerol stocks (8ul in 5ml LB) for:
<partinfo>BBa_J23101</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23110</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23116</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23118</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23114</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_B0033</partinfo>
TECAN experiment started at 10:20am.
In the morning one single colony was picked for BW53474 E. coli strain and glycerol stock was prepared after about 7 hours (37°C 220rpm)
Inoculum of:
BW53474 (falcon containing culture for glycerol stock was re-filled with 5ml LB)
MG1655 (from glycerol stock)
BW25141 (from glycerol stock)
BW25142 (from glycerol stock)

July, 7th
Competent cells preparation for:
MG1655
BW53474
BW25141
BW25142
PCR was performed to amplify Phasins:
All parts were correct!! :)

July, 8th
Transformation of 1ul (~4ng) of miniprepped <partinfo>BBa_J23118</partinfo> into 100ul of home-made competent cells
MG1655
BW25141
BW25142
BW53474
DH5-alpha (as control)
to verify the transformation efficiency.
Transformed bacteria were plated on LB+Amp and left overnight in oven, 37°C.

July, 9th
We checked the presence of colonies in plates. All plates showed red colonies!
MG1655 plate (with satellite colonies)
BW25141 plate
BW25142 plate
BW53474 plate
DH5-alpha plate
We calculated (thanks Nicolò) efficiency as #colonies/ug DNA
