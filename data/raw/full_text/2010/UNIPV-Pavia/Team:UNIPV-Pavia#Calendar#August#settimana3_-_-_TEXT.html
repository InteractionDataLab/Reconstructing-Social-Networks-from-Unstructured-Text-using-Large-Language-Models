August, 16th
Resuspension  from iGEM 2010 Distribution Kit of <partinfo>BBa_J13002</partinfo> (Plate 1, Well 13B) and <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo> (Plate 2, Well 8A).
Transformation (1 ul) of <partinfo>BBa_J13002</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_I13522</partinfo>, INTEIN, CREAM (Mr.Gene) into 100 ul of E. coli TOP10 home-made competent cells.
Transformation of 15-4C5 (1 ul) into in re-competentized E. coli TOP10 carrying <partinfo>BBa_T9002</partinfo>.
Transfomants were plated on LB+Amp 100 ug/ml agar plates, the last one on LB+Amp100+Cm12,5 agar plates and were let grow ON at 37°C.

Two medium gel were prepared and samples were loaded and gel run/cut.
Vectors digested and gel run/cut
Inserts digested and gel run/cut
All samples were correctly digested and run; both I20M-1 and I20A-1 are positive, so we decided to use I20M-1; this new screening for I21-4 showed again that it's correct.
Gel extraction gave these results:
I0 (E-X): 20,8 ng/ul
<partinfo>BB_F2620</partinfo> (E-S): 13,5 ng/ul
INTEIN (E-S): 6,5 ng/ul
<partinfo>BB_B0034</partinfo> (E-X): 23,2 ng/ul
I20M-1 (E-S): 7,4 ng/ul
<partinfo>BB_J13002</partinfo> (S-P): 12,5 ng/ul
I21-4 (E-S): 7,2 ng/ul
I21-4 (E-X): 24,7 ng/ul
<partinfo>BBa_K105012</partinfo> (E-X): 23,1 ng/ul
I26 (E-S): 3,4 ng/ul
I20M-1 (X-P): 6,5 ng/ul
They were stored ON at -20°C.

Sample was loaded into a small agarose gel, run and cut.
After gel estraction was quantified with Nanodrop: 19,6 ng/ul.
Finally were performed the following ligations:
I31: I20M-1 (E-S) + <partinfo>BBa_K105012</partinfo> (E-X)
I32: I20M-1 (E-S) + I21-4 (E-X)
I33: I20M-1 (E-S) + I0 (E-X)
I34: I21-4 (E-S) + I0 (E-X)
I35: I21-4 (E-S) + <partinfo>BBa_K105012</partinfo> (E-X)
I36: I21-4 (E-S) + I21-4 (E-X)
I37: INTEIN (E-S) + I0 (E-X)
I38: <partinfo>BBa_F2620</partinfo> + <partinfo>BBa_B0034</partinfo>
I39: <partinfo>BBa_J13002</partinfo> + I20M-1 (X-P)
I40: I26 (E-S) + INTEIN (E-X)
I41: I26 (E-S) + I0 (E-X)

Ligations of previous day were transformed (1 ul) into 100 ul of home-made competent cells 'E. coli DH5-alpha. They were than plated on LB+Amp agar plates and incubated ON at 37°C.
Colony PCR was performed for MyCRIM (9 colonies), 1 blank, 1 negative control (I5(X-S)), 1 positive control (MrGene CRIM from plate).
Screening PCR: MyCRIM (first 9 samples), ladder, blank, RING, CRIM from MrGene.
