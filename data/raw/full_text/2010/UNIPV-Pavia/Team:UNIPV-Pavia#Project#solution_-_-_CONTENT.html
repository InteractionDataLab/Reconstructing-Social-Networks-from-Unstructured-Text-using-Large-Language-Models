</P><P>Self-inducible promoters were considered to avoid the usage of inducible systems especially in large-scale industrial bioprocesses, in which protein production has to be triggered by expensive inducer molecules.
</P><P>Standard and user friendly integrative vectors for E. coli and S. cerevisiae were designed to stably integrate the expression systems of interest in the microbial host genome and to eliminate the need of expensive selection techniques, such as antibiotics or auxotrophic media.
</P><P>Finally, an &quot;in-cell&quot; protein purification system was implemented using BioBrick parts: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. This solution can thus replace the usage of expensive affinity resins/columns and proteases.

These devices are promoters able to initiate the production of the target protein when the cell culture reaches the desired culture density.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Exploiting_quorum_sensing_mechanism..."><B>Exploiting quorum sensing mechanism...</B></SPAN></H3><P>Different studies demonstrated that many bacteria can communicate through a mechanism called <I>quorum sensing</I> and can regulate gene expression relying on cell culture density. One of the most studied organisms is <I>V. fischeri</I>, for which the quorum sensing is regulated by two genes: luxI and luxR. The first one encodes a protein responsible for the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6-homoserine-lactone (3OC6HSL or simply HSL), a small molecule called <I>autoinducer</I>. The second one encodes a protein capable to bind the HSL. The <I>lux pR</I> promoter, which is normally off, can be activated by the LuxR-HSL complex when the autoinducer reaches a critical concentration.
</P><P>When a cell population expresses luxI, the concentration of HSL is an increasing function of cell culture density and so the induction of the <I>lux pR</I> promoter occurs only when the cells reach a threshold density.
</P><P>Taking inspiration from this natural regulation mechanism, a library of self-inducible devices was built by engineering quorum sensing circuits in <I>E. coli</I>. The critical cell density was modulated by changing the autoinducer molecule synthesis rate. In this way, the library members can initiate the <I>lux pR</I> gene expression at different cell densities of the host strain. In <I>V. fischeri</I>, the <I>lux pR</I> regulates a set of genes involved in the bioluminescence of the bacteria, but in synthetic circuits based on this regulatory mechanism users can regulate the expression of the desired genes (Fig.1).

</P><P><I>Vector engineering features:</I></P><OL><LI>The <B>cloning site</B> is compatible with the original BioBrick standard (RFC10), i.e. it is composed by the BioBrick Prefix (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00000&lt;/partinfo&gt;) and Suffix (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00001&lt;/partinfo&gt;). The presence of illegal restriction sites (XbaI in &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_J72001&lt;/partinfo&gt; and SpeI in &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300991&lt;/partinfo&gt;) prevents the usage of this backbone in the classic BioBrick Standard Assembly process. However, the presence of unique EcoRI and PstI sites in Prefix and Suffix <B>fully supports the assembly of the desired BioBrick parts in the cloning site upon EcoRI-PstI digestion</B> and also <B>supports the 3A Assembly</B>.
</LI><LI>The two <B>NheI</B> restriction sites flanking the default <I>integration guide</I> sequence &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300991&lt;/partinfo&gt; enable the <B>engineering of this backbone by assembling new user-defined BioBrick <I>integration guides</I> upon XbaI-SpeI digestion</B>, if the desired guide conforms to the RFC10 or a compatible standard.
</LI><LI>The default insert &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_I52002&lt;/partinfo&gt; contains the positive selection marker &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_P1016&lt;/partinfo&gt; and the pUC19-derived replication origin &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_I50022&lt;/partinfo&gt;. &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_P1016&lt;/partinfo&gt; expresses the <I>ccdB</I> toxin gene, which is lethal for most <I>E. coli</I> strains and is useful to <B>prevent the growth of transformants containing the uncut plasmid contaminant DNA</B>. For this reason, the default vector must be propagated in <I>ccdB</I>-tolerant strains, such as DB3.1 (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_V1005&lt;/partinfo&gt;). &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_I50022&lt;/partinfo&gt; enables the propagation of this vector at high copy in the used <I>ccdB</I>-tolerant strain.
</LI><LI>Like in many other standard vector backbones (e.g. the pSB**5 series), the <B>binding sites for standard primers</B> VF2 (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00100&lt;/partinfo&gt;) and VR (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00102&lt;/partinfo&gt;) are present upstream and downstream of the BioBrick cloning site respectively. These two sequences are sufficiently distant from the cloning site to enable a good quality sequencing of the insert.
</LI></OL><P><I>Genome integration features:</I></P><OL><LI>The four transcriptional terminators &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0053&lt;/partinfo&gt;, &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0054&lt;/partinfo&gt;, &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0055&lt;/partinfo&gt; and &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0062&lt;/partinfo&gt;<B>ensure the transcriptional insulation of the integrated part from its flanking genome sequences</B>.
</LI><LI>The two FRT recombination sites (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_J72001&lt;/partinfo&gt;) enable the excision of &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300994&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300998&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G0001&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0025&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G0001&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300999&lt;/partinfo&gt;-&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300995&lt;/partinfo&gt; (i.e. the R6K origin and the Chloramphenicol resistance marker) <B>upon Flp recombinase activity</B>.

When using the default integration guide &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300991&lt;/partinfo&gt;, the integration method relies on the bacteriophage site-specific recombination (attP-mediated recombination) through the attP site on the integrative vector and the attB site in the host genome.
</P><P>This integration method is applicable when the host strain does not have prophages in the att(Phi80) locus. TOP10 (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_V1009&lt;/partinfo&gt;) and DH5alpha (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_V1001&lt;/partinfo&gt;) strains have the Phi80 prophage and so their chromosome cannot be engineered with this procedure.
</P><P>The genomic integration of the desired BioBrick part into the attP(Phi80) locus has to be mediated by co-transforming a helper plasmid, such as the Amp-resistant &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_J72008&lt;/partinfo&gt; plasmid, which carries the IntPhi80 site-specific integrase gene under the control of a thermoinducible promoter (see Fig.14). The helper plasmid also has a heat-sensitive replication origin, whose replication can be inhibited at temperatures of 37-42Â°C, while a permissive temperature for this vector is 30Â°C. For this reason, it can be cured at high temperatures, when the integrase expression is triggered at the same time.
The Phi80 integrase mediates the site-specific recombination between the attP site in the integrative vector and the attB site in the bacterial genome (for a schematic description of this process, see Fig.15 and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Recombination" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://partsregistry.org/Recombination</A>).

The CmR and the R6K can be excised from the genome by exploiting the two FRT recombination sites that flank them. The Flp recombinase protein mediates this recombination event (for a schematic description of this process, see Fig.16 and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Recombination" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://partsregistry.org/Recombination</A>), so it has to be expressed by a helper plasmid, such as pCP20 (CGSC#7629).
This enables the sequential integration of several parts using the same antibiotic resistance marker, which can be each time eliminated.

This vector can also be specialized to target the desired integration site in the host genome.
</P><P>The default version of this backbone targets the Gal system of the S288C strain (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300979&lt;/partinfo&gt;) through the two homologous regions &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300986&lt;/partinfo&gt; and &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300987&lt;/partinfo&gt;. The Gal system is not essential for yeast survival if the strain is grown on carbon sources other than galactose.
</P><P>This vector enables multiple integrations in different positions of the same genome. The usage of the KanMX dominant selection marker can avoid the usage of auxotrophic markers. In the industrial framework auxotrophies are usually deleterious for the process productivity because they affect the growth rate of cells. For this reason, this vector can be a concrete solution for the design of industrial yeast strains with novel user-defined functions.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Design_features_2">Design features</SPAN></H3><P>This vector backbone was designed as a modular integrative vector for <I>S. cerevisiae</I>. In this section, the main design features for vector engineering and for the genome integration of the vector are reported.
</P><P><I>Vector engineering features:</I></P><OL><LI>The <B>cloning site</B> is not the same as other RFC10 compatible vectors. It contains a <B>RFC10 BioBrick Prefix (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00000&lt;/partinfo&gt;) and a SpeI restriction site</B> instead of the original BioBrick Suffix. However, the presence of unique EcoRI and SpeI sites in the cloning site <B>fully supports the assembly of the desired BioBrick parts in the cloning site upon EcoRI-SpeI digestion</B>. This design feature has been forced by the presence of illegal XbaI and PstI sites in the TEF promoter in the LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300989&lt;/partinfo&gt;). This vector <B>does not support the 3A Assembly</B>.
</LI><LI>The two <B>NheI</B> sites and the two <B>AvrII</B> sites flanking the default HR integration sequences &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300986&lt;/partinfo&gt; and &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300987&lt;/partinfo&gt; enable the <B>engineering of this backbone by assembling new user-defined BioBrick integration sequences upon XbaI-SpeI digestion</B>.
</LI><LI>This vector <B>can be propagated in <I>E. coli</I> at high copy</B> thanks to the pMB1 replication origin and the Ampicillin resistance marker present in &lt;partinfo&gt;pSB1A2&lt;/partinfo&gt; (=&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300988&lt;/partinfo&gt;), that is one of the standard parts that compose this integrative vector.
</LI><LI>Standard verification primer binding sites VF2 (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00100&lt;/partinfo&gt;) and VR (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_G00102&lt;/partinfo&gt;) are present in the &lt;partinfo&gt;pSB1A2&lt;/partinfo&gt; (=&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300988&lt;/partinfo&gt;) backbone. They can be used to <B>verify the vector length and sequence comprised between the two integration sites</B>.
</LI></OL><P><I>Genome integration features:</I></P><OL><LI>The LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300989&lt;/partinfo&gt;) enables the <B>selection of positive yeast integrants on YPD agar plates supplemented with 200 ug/ml of G418 geneticin</B>. Once integrated, this cassette can be <B>excised upon Cre recombinase activity</B>. This allows to perform multiple integrations in the same strain, always using the same dominant G418 resistance marker.
</LI><LI>The heterologous modules in the LoxP-KanMX-LoxP cassette (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300989&lt;/partinfo&gt;), i.e. the TEF promoter and the TEF transcriptional terminator from <I>A. gossypii</I> and the KanR from the Tn903 transposon of <I>E. coli</I>, show a very low homology with the <I>S. cerevisiae</I> genome.

Briefly, they imply the use of expensive proteases for tag removal from the fusion protein, requiring the appropriate aminoacidic sequence to be included between the tag and the target protein. Moreover, the cost of the affinity resins used in the process is far from negligible, especially on industrial scale.
</P><P>The use of self-cleaving protein elements coupled with innovative affinity tags has been recently proposed to overcome these limitations. For all these reasons, in this section a technique compliant to the BioBrick assembly standard and based on self-splicing affinity tags derived from the fusion of Phasins, Inteins and a short flexible linker is proposed.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Tag">Tag</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Phasin">Phasin</SPAN></H3><P>Phasins are proteins involved in formation and stabilization of PolyHydroxyAlkanoates (PHA), intracytoplasmic inclusions in microorganisms like <I>Ralstonia eutropha</I> which serve as carbon and energy storage. As such, Phasins exhibit highly specific binding to PHA granules and can be used to create tags for proteins, while PHB can be used as the affinity matrix.
</P><P>In literature, it has also been shown that the Phasin-tagged fusion protein's affinity with PHA granules can be improved by increasing the number of Phasins in the fusion protein.
</P><P>The <I>Ralstonia eutropha</I>âs Phasin coding sequence, &lt;partinfo&gt;K208001&lt;/partinfo&gt;, was already present in the Registry in Silver standard. However, at the end of this gene there was a TGA stop codon which prevents the usage of this Phasin as a head or internal domain.
</P><P>In order to overcome this problem, &lt;partinfo&gt;K208001&lt;/partinfo&gt; has been improved for fusion protein applications by mutagenesis through PCR using custom primers. Two new BioBrick parts were built and submitted to the Registry:
</P><UL><LI>&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300002&lt;/partinfo&gt;: Phasin - head domain (removed stop codon; Assembly Standard 10 prefix; Silver Standard suffix)
</LI><LI>&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300003&lt;/partinfo&gt;: Phasin - internal domain (removed stop codon; Silver Standard prefix; Silver Standard suffix)
</LI></UL><P>These two new parts allow the construction of composite synthetic affinity tags, built by assembling an arbitrary number of Phasins (it has been shown that a better affinity is achieved by fusing of two or more Phasins). In this work a flexible linker sequence (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K105012&lt;/partinfo&gt;) that connects the Phasins has also been used in order to test if it can improve or facilitate the binding and folding of the tag.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="PHA_production">PHA production</SPAN></H3><P>PHA production in <I>R. eutropha</I> is achieved by the PhaCAB operon, which contains three genes, phbC, phbA and phbB, each encoding for an enzyme essential for the formation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a kind of polyhydroxyalkanoate) inclusions. In literature, the production of PHB has already been achieved in <I>E. coli</I> by incorporating the PhaCAB operon. The PHB granules produced by engineered <I>E. coli</I> can be used as an affinity matrix for Phasin-based affinity tags and the binding of the Phasin-tagged protein of interest can occur <I>in vivo</I>.
</P><P>Several parts for PHB production are present in the Registry: in the past iGEM editions, the Duke (2008 and 2009), Hawaii (2008), Tsinghua (2008), Virginia (2008) teams worked on it and submitted a set of BioBrick parts for PHB synthesis. However, the complete phaCAB operon is not available in the Registry. Because a lot of work about PHB has already been done and because our short term goal was not to optimize the PHB granules productions, an existing engineered <I>E. coli</I> strain able to produce PHB was used as a proof-of-concept affinity matrix producer. This strain comes from the DSMZ public collection and is named <A href="http://www.dsmz.de/microorganisms/plasmid_info.php?dsmz_no=15372" target="_blank">DMSZ15372</A>.
</P><P>Taking advantage of the natural affinity of Phasins to PHB, it is possible to engineer strains in which PHB and the Phasin-tagged protein of interest are co-produced and the binding can occur. The overall yield and specificity of the process depends on the structure of the Phasin-based tags, which can be easily constructed or modified by using BioBrick parts compatible with the common RFC10 and RFC23 standards to perform in-frame assemblies.
</P><P>For this reason these tags are modular and can be freely expanded; a generic one is shown in Fig.23.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:172px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 23: Generic tag composed by two Phasin coding sequences separated by a flexible peptide linker coding sequence.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Protein_purification_system">Protein purification system</SPAN></H2><P>Phasins and PHB granules can replace the common affinity tags and matrix respectively. However, expensive proteases are still essential to remove the tag after the Phasins-PHB binding. A novel engineered inducible Intein can be used to complete the purification process by removing the affinity tag, thus replacing proteases.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Intein">Intein</SPAN></H3><P>Inteins (Intervening Proteins) are sequences capable of self-exciding from a precursor protein through a process known as self-splicing, forming a peptide bond between the flanking proteins (exteins). Many so-called mini-Inteins have been engineered, whose key feature is the capability to completely release a flanking extein (the target protein) in response to a simple stimulus, either chemical or physical, with no need of expensive proteases.
</P><P>In literature, one mini-Intein was obtained through mutagenesis of <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I><I>Mtu RecA</I> Intein. The sequence of this Intein, referred to as ÎI-CM, allows for pH/heat-controlled C-terminal cleavage.
</P><P>Thanks to this feature, the ÎI-CM Intein can be fused downstream of an affinity tag and upstream of the protein coding sequence of interest in order to enable a cheap cleavage process to remove the N-terminal tag.
</P><P>In this project, the ÎI-CM Intein sequence was designed according to [Wood DW et al., 1999] and codon-optimized for <I>E. coli</I> to yield &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K300004&lt;/partinfo&gt;. This part was designed as an internal domain (prefix and suffix compatible with Silver standard) in order to enable protein coding sequence assemblies to generate the desired synthetic self-cleavable affinity tags for protein purification.
</P><P>Thus, it is possible to create an engineered protein purification system that uses the tag construct and relies on Intein self-cleaving capabilities. Fig.24 shows a generic purification tag, composed by Phasins and Intein, as an example.
