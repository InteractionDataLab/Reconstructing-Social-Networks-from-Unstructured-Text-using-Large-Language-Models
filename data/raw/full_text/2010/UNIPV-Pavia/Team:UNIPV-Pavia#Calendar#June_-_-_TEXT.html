June, 3rd
9° Meeting - Discussion of final and technical details about The Project . Planning of Bio-Lab activity.
JUNE: WEEK 2
June, 7th
1° Bio-Lab - <partinfo>BBa_E2050</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K165018</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K165037</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_J61001</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K081008</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K125500</partinfo> were resuspended from Spring 2010 DNA distribution. <partinfo>BBa_P1004</partinfo> was resuspended from Spring 2009 DNA distribution. All BioBricks were transformed in E. coli DH5alpha.
Liquid LB+Amp and LB+Amp agar plates were prepared according with "protocols".
June, 8th
2° Bio-Lab - Inoculum from plates in liquid Lb and glycerol stocks preparation. Falcon were re-filled for tomorrow mini-prep.
June, 9th
3° Bio-Lab - MiniPrep of <partinfo>BBa_E2050</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K165018</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K165037</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_J61001</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K081008</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K125500</partinfo>. Digestion, gel run/cut and ligation of:
I0: <partinfo>BBa_K125500</partinfo> (E-S)+<partinfo>BBa_B0015</partinfo> (E-X)
I1: <partinfo>BBa_E2050</partinfo> (E-S)+<partinfo>BBa_K165018</partinfo> (E-X)
I2: <partinfo>BBa_P1004</partinfo> (E-S)+<partinfo>BBa_B0015</partinfo> (E-X)
I3: <partinfo>BBa_K081008</partinfo> (E-S)+<partinfo>BBa_B0015</partinfo> (E-X)
June, 10th
4° Bio-Lab - Transformation of ligations I0, I1, I2, I3 in home made E. coli DH5-alpha competent cells. Transformants were plated on LB+Amp agar plates.
June, 11th
5° Bio-Lab - Inoculum from plates in liquid LB and glycerol stocks preparation for I0, I1, I2 and I3 in duplicate (2 colonies picked from each plate).
June, 12th
iGEM EU workshop.
June, 13th
iGEM EU workshop.
JUNE: WEEK 3
June, 14th
6° Bio-Lab -  Inoculum from glycerol stock of I0-1, I0-2, I1-1, i1-2, I2-1, I3-1 and I3-2 for screening.
June, 15th
7° Bio-Lab - MiniPrep, gel run/cut and ligation of
I4: <partinfo>BBa_K165037</partinfo> (S-P) + I1 (X-P)
I5: I2 (E-S) + <partinfo>BBa_J61001</partinfo> (E-X)
I6: I3 (E-S) + <partinfo>BBa_T9002</partinfo> (E-X)
June, 16th
8° Bio-Lab - Tranformation of I4 (DH5-alpha), I5 (TOP10) and I6 (DH5-alpha).
June, 17th
9° Bio-Lab - Colonies were picked from each plate, I4-1, I4-2, I5-1, I5-2, I6-1, I6-2 and I6-3 were grown in 1ml liquid culture and glycerol stocked (not I5-2, because no growth was observed in LB+Cm and not for I6-1, not grown). Cultures refilled with 5ml LB+antibiotic for tomorrow MiniPrep and screening.
June, 18th
10° Bio-Lab - MiniPrep for I4-1, I4-2, I5-1, I6-2 and I6-3. Screening gel (all the clones are ok!) :)
JUNE: WEEK 4
June, 21st
11° Bio-Lab - Week activities planning and freezer sorting.
June, 22nd
12° Bio-Lab - Inoculations of I6, BBa_J23118, BBa_J23110, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23116.
June, 23rd
13° Bio-Lab - 10° Meeting - Updating about Bio-Lab activity.
MiniPrep of ON cultures I6, BBa_J23118, BBa_J23110, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23116, with NanoDrop quantification. Digestions, gel run and extraction of the above. We received BBa_K208001, the Silver-fusion compatible BioBrick part that codes for phasin. Streaked them on two LB+Kan agar plates (named PhaP-1 and PhaP-2)
June, 24th
14° Bio-Lab - Colonies on both PhaP-1 and PhaP-2. Inoculation of one colony per plate, with subsequent growth for 6hrs. Glycerol stocks and refill for tomorrow MiniPrep. Yesterday's ligations heated to inactivate ligase and transformed in TOP10 homemade competent cells.
June, 25th
15° Bio-Lab - Plates all show colonies! Picked two colonies from each plate and incubated in 1ml LB+Amp. The cultures were grown for six hours then glycerol stocks were made. PhaP-1 and 2 MiniPrep and quantification by NanoDrop. DNA quantification was poor, so we decided to perform digestion screening and to repeat Miniprep next week for sequencing. Then they were digested and gel screened, both resulting positive.
JULY: WEEK 1
June, 28th
16° Bio-Lab - Inoculum from glycerol stock for I7-1, I7-2, I8-1, I8-2, I9-1, I9-2, I10-1 and I10-2 in 5ml LB+Amp. Cultures grown overnight. Inoculum of PhaP-1 and PhaP-2 in 5ml LB+Kan and ON growth. Received strains and plasmid from CGSC (Yale University). Details in the week view.
June, 29th
17° Bio-Lab - From I7-1, I7-2, I8-1, I8-2, I9-1, I9-2, I10-1 and I10-2 5ul were aliquoted and diluted in 500ul LB+Amp for a preliminary TECAN test. Then cultures were MiniPrepped. Almost all cultures were digested. PhaP-1 and PhaP-2 were prepared or sequencing. All strains received from Yale Univesity were on blotting paper disks, that were placed on an LB agar plates, resuspended and then streaked. After plate streaking, disks were transferred in falcon tubes containing liquid LB.
June, 30th
18° Bio-Lab - Inoculum of cultures for a TECAN test.
