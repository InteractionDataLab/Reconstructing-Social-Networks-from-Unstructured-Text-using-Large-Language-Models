The non-fluorescent culture was considered in the same conditions of the culture of interest (e.g. induced with the same inducer concentration and with the same plasmid/antibiotic resistance, but without fluorescent reporter genes). This operation allows the removal, from the target fluorescent signal, of the &quot;self-fluorescent&quot; component and the fluorescence signal obtained is &quot;blanked&quot;.

Then the linear regression was performed in order to estimate the slope of the line m. Finally the doubling time was estimated as d=ln(2)/m [minutes].
</P><P>In the case of multiple growth curves for a strain, the mean value of the processed curves was computed for each time sample before applying the above described procedure. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Data_analysis_for_self-inducible_promoters_.28initiation-treshold_determination.29">Data analysis for self-inducible promoters (initiation-treshold determination)</SPAN></H3><P>The task of this analysis is the evaluation of the initiation transcription point (in terms of absorbance) for self-inducible devices. The transition O.D.600 value is named, from now on, O.D.start.
Data from three indipendent wells were averaged and blanked. O.D.600 signals were blanked as described in &quot;Preliminary Remarks&quot; section, while the fluorescence signal was blanked with the fluorescence of &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_T9002&lt;/partinfo&gt; part, assembled in the same plasmid of the considered promoter. This operation allows the removal from the fluorescence signal of the autofluorescence component and of the “leaky” component (due to the leakage of <I>lux pR</I> promoter in absence of the autoinducer molecule HSL).
</P><P>O.D.start was evaluated by computing the <I>Scell</I> (GFPmut3 synthesis rate per cell) signal for the desired self-inducible promoter.
</P><P>Scell was obtained by computing (1/O.D.600)*dGFP/dt, where O.D.600 and GFP are the blanked absorbance and fluorescence signals.
</P><P>The goal is the estimation of the critical O.D.600 value (O.D.start) at which the Scell significantly increases. Because Scell is a very noisy signal, a threshold value which takes into account the noise variability was proposed and it is described below.
</P><P>Two different signals, measured from independent samples of the same non-fluorescent culture in the same experiment, are considered: C1 and C2. The fluorescence signal of C1 and C2 (F_C1 and F_C2 respectively) can be thought as the addition of a “real signal” and a noise component.
</P><P>F_C1 and F_C2 have the same expected value and the same standard deviation, since they are two independent realizations of the same aleatory process: in fact, they are two time series acquired from the same cultures in the same growth conditions by the same instrument.
Noise signal was computed as:
</P><P>An interesting signal is the Scell of <I>N</I> time series. It can be evaluated as the time derivative of <I>N</I>, divided by O.D.600 of the culture. It has the behaviour shown in figure:
</P><P>It is fair to say that the noise of Scell is bigger for low O.D.600 values and its amplitude decreases dramatically for higher O.D.600 values (e.g.: O.D.600&gt;0.1 measured with the TECAN Infinite F200 in a 96-well microplate).
</P><P>The O.D.600-dependent noise model proposed for the Scell signal is:
</P><P>According to the formula reported above, it is possible to obtain the sigma_bar value as follows:
</P><OL><LI>multiply the Scell time series values with the corresponding O.D.600;
</LI><LI>the sigma_bar constant value can be estimated as the standard deviation of this signal.
</LI></OL><P>The Scell*O.D.600 signal behaviour is reported below:
</P><P>As this figure shows, the noise amplitude of this signal is no more O.D.600-dependent and the sigma_bar can be obtained.
</P><P>
The evaluation of the O.D.start can be performed supposing that the transcription starts when the signal is significantly different from the noise. A threshold on the signal amplitude was estabilished as reported here:
</P><P>In order to make the method more robust, induction was considered only when 5 consecutive values exceeded the threshold amplitude.
</P><P>
The operation of subtracting the two signals F_C1 and F_C2 is analogous to the “blanking” operation performed on data, as described previously. For, this reason, under the hypothesis that the signals have the same variance (this is a consistent hypothesis, since they are measured by the same instrument in the same experimental conditions), this argument can be extended to the “blanked” data considered in the processing. 
In particular, it is evident that the &quot;blanked&quot; signal is affected by the same noise described above and thus, the noise of Scell signal is analogous to the one described before.
Thus, this threshold was used to compute the O.D.start for the cultures. This heuristic algorithm was implemented in Matlab and analysis results are reported in the “results” section.

In fact the knowledge of this parameter enables the rational design of cell-communication systems, such as the self-inducible devices studied in this project.
</P><P>A model based approach was proposed to estimate this interesting parameter. 
</P><P>Under the hypotheses that:
</P><UL><LI> no HSL is present at the beginning of the experiment - consistent hypothesis because a growth medium washing step is always performed before the experiment start in order to remove the HSL produced until that moment,
</LI><LI> the HSL synthesis rate is not time-dependent (cells produce HSL at the same rate in each growth phase - this hypotesis simplifies the data analysis, but it should be further validated),
</LI><LI> the half life of the autoinducer is much longer than the experiment duration (i.e. the degradation of the molecule is negligible - this hypothesis is consistent, since no HSL-degrading enzyme is present in <I>E. coli</I>),
</LI></UL><P>an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model which describes the HSL production in the growth media can be written:

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Data_analysis_for_RPU_evaluation">Data analysis for RPU evaluation</SPAN></H3><P>The RPUs are standard units proposed by  Kelly J. et al., 2009, in which the relative transcriptional strength of a promoter can be measured using a reference standard.
</P><P>RPUs have been computed as:
</P><P>in which:
</P><UL><LI> phi is the promoter of interest and J23101 is the reference standard promoter (taken from the Anderson Promoter Collection);
</LI><LI> F is the blanked fluorescence of the culture, computed by subtracting for each time sample the fluorescence value of a negative control (a non-fluorescent culture). In our experiments, the TOP10 cells bearing BBa_B0032 or BBa_B0033 were usually used because they are RBSs and do not have expression systems for reporter genes;
</LI><LI> ASB is the blanked absorbance (O.D.600) of the culture, computed as described in &quot;Preliminary remarks&quot; section. 
</LI></UL><P>RPU measurement has the following advantages (under suitable conditions)
</P><UL><LI> it is proportional to PoPS (Polymerase Per Second), a very important parameter that expresses the transcription rate of a promoter;
</LI><LI> it uses a reference standard and so measurements can be compared between different laboratories. 
</LI></UL><P>The hypotheses on which RPU theory is based can be found in Kelly J. et al., 2008, as well as all the mathematical steps. From our point of view, the main hypotheses that have to be satisfied are the following:
</P><UL><LI> the reporter protein must have a half life higher than the experiment duration (we use GFPmut3 - &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_E0040&lt;/partinfo&gt; -, which has an estimated half life of at least 24 hours, or an engineered RFP - &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_E1010&lt;/partinfo&gt;, for which the half life has not been measured, but is qualitatively comparable with the GFP's);
</LI><LI> strain, plasmid copy number, antibiotic, growth medium, growth conditions, protein generator assembled downstream of the promoter must be the same in the promoter of interest and in J23101 reference standard.
</LI><LI> steady state must be valid, so (dF/dt)/ASB (proportional to the GFP synthesis rate per cell) must be constant.
</LI></UL><P>In order to compute the RPUs, the Scell signals ((dGFP/dt)/ASB)) of the promoter of interest and of the reference J23101 were averaged in the time interval corresponding to the exponential growth phase. The boundaries of exponential phase were identified with a visual inspection of the linear phase of the logarithmic growth curve.
