JULY: WEEK 3
July, 12th
Phasins PhaP1 and PhaP2 were sequenced, but none of them has a clear chromatogram, so we decided to amplify them by PCR and sequence results.
Gel run/cut of phasins amplified via PCR
Phasins were gel run/cut and the samples were prepared to be sequenced.
Inoculum of
<partinfo>BBa_J23101</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23105</partinfo>
<partinfo>BBa_J23106</partinfo>
for tomorrow ligations.

96,1 ng/ul
<partinfo>BBa_J23105</partinfo>
62,8 ng/ul
<partinfo>BBa_J23106</partinfo>

These samples were digested at 37°C for 1 hour. Gel was loaded with digestions and with <partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo> and pCP20 not digested. Expected length for digestions was:
<partinfo>BBa_J72007</partinfo>: 1816 and 1351 bp
<partinfo>BBa_J72008</partinfo>: 3580 and 2755 bp (6335 not digested)
pAH123: 2755 and 2437
pCP20: 9400bp
Considered the results obtained, we decided to perform a further screening for <partinfo>BBa_J72007</partinfo>.  Glycerol stock was prepared for PBHR68 and PBHR68 Backup, then falcon tube was re-filled with 5ml LB+Amp for further screening.  Inoculum of <partinfo>BBa_J72007</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_J72013</partinfo> were performed in 5ml LB+Cm 34 (HC). All falcon tubes were placed at 37°C 220 rpm.
Today we received our new enzymes!!!

We checked agar plates after transformation. All plates were ok, except for:
I11: only few colonies were observed
I10-4C5: only 2 colonies were observed
I15: only few colonies were observed
2 colonies were picked from every plate and grown in 1ml LB + antibiotic at 37°C, 220rpm for 6 hours (for colonies grown on LB+Cm, also 1ml LB+Amp was infected). After that glycerol stocks were prepared for:

Remaining cultures were re-filled with 5ml LB+antibiotic and incubated (37°C, 220 rpm) for tomorrow screening.
I10-4C5-2 was grown also in LB+Amp, so it was thrown away!
PBHR68 was grown, ok! :) MiniPrep was performed for:
PBHR68 (BioPlastic operon) -> 272 ng/ul
<partinfo>BBa_J72007</partinfo>(CRIM plasmid) -> 41 ng/ul (not clean spectrum at 230nm)

Digestions were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours, then gel run.
Gel results showed that:
I11 ligations are not correct, the same for I13. This is probably due to the fact that promoters for these two parts are too strong, giving an excessive metabolic burden to cells. For this reason, we decided not to repeat these two ligations.
I12 parts are ok
I14, I16, I17, I18 and I19 are correct, they will be further screened with a TECAN experiment.
I15 was wrong, we decided to repeat this ligation, since ligations with stronger promoters were successful.
I74C5 and I84C5 are ok
I104C5-2 didn't work. This ligation will be repeated.
We decided to performe a TECAN test on our parts, in order to see if RFP was correctly excided from BBa_J231xx vector, since length of RFP and of our insert (RBS-luxI-tt) were similar. For this reason parts that passed "Gel control" were inoculated:
I14-1 (LB+Amp)
I14-2 (LB+Amp)
I16-1 (LB+Amp)
I16-2 (LB+Amp)
I17-1 (LB+Amp)
I17-2 (LB+Amp)
I18-1 (LB+Amp)
I18-2 (LB+Amp)
I19-1 (LB+Amp)
I19-2 (LB+Amp)
and tomorrow we will measure RFP in cultures, hoping not to find it!! :)
Screening ligations I11-I16
Screening ligations I17-I19, I7/I8/I10-4C5
We created a pseudo CRIM plasmid on our own to check that not pir strains aren't able to propagate it. We called it "THE RING" (RING) and we built it from our I5 (Cm resistance - <partinfo>BBa_P1004</partinfo> - + TT - <partinfo>BBa_B0015</partinfo> - + R6K ori - <partinfo>BBa_J61001</partinfo>) in <partinfo>pSB1A2</partinfo>:
