Glycerol stocks of MG43, MC42, MC43. Static TECAN test (absorbance, green fluorescence and red fluorescence) on 200 ul of these cultures.
Cultures were diluted in 4 ml final of LB in order to obtain the same lowest OD with the following formula: culture to remove and substitute with LB=FinalVolume-(lowestOD/measuredOD)*FinalVolume. Centrifuge at 4000 rpm, 25°C for 5 min to pellet the culture, discard the surnatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of M9. Static TECAN test (absorbance, green fluorescence and red fluorescence) on 200 ul of these cultures.
Liquid PCR was performed on MG43 (3 colonies), MC42 (3 colonies), MC43 (3 colonies), MC1061 (negative control) with the following parameters: T_annealing=52°C, cycles composed by 10 min at 94°C, 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec at 52°C and 4 min at 72°C . This is the result:
PCR results for screening.
MiniPreps of I44-1:5 and I51-1:5 were performed with these results:

Probably was used the ethanol buffer without adding before the ethanol, during the wash step and so the quantifications were so low.

Gel screening shows that all the constructs were ok, so we decided to choose I44-2 and I51-3.

Cultures for TECAN test were diluted in the morning (h10:20) 1:100 (40ul in 4ml) and let grown at 37°C 220 rpm till they reach the desired OD.
Trasformation of I42 and I43 in MC008 and MG008 strains, strain DB3.1 without DNA and pSB1C3 RFP in DB3.1 strain. MG42, MC43, MC42, MC43 were plated on LB+Cm34 plates instead DB3.1 on LB+Cm12.5 plates. Integration protocol first day were performed.

Minipreps were quantified as follows:
I20: 113.5 ng/ul
I31: 76.4  ng/ul
I32: 85.4 ng/ul
I35: 77.2 ng/ul
I36: 83.8 ng/ul
I37: 156.5 ng/ul
I38: 94.4 ng/ul
I40: 556 ng/ul
I41: 148.2 ng/ul
They were digested:
I20: SpeI-PstI
I31: EcoRI-XbaI
I32: E-S
I35: S-P
I36: E-S
I37: E-X; X-P
I38: E-S
I40: E-S
I41: E-X
MG42 and MG43 showed no colonies: probably the reason was a mistake on the choice of the MG008 strain tubes during the trasformations.
