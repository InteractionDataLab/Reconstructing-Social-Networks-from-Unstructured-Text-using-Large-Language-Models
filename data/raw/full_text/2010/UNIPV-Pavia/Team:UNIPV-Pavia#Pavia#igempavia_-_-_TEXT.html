IGEM [Last Editions]
Adventure of The University of Pavia in iGEM competition began in 2008 and continued with a good success in the  last edition.
2008
The Project
2008 UNIPV-Pavia iGEM Team
Two years ago the team of the University of Pavia was interested in genetic implementation of logic circuits: the team’s  goal was to provide a boolean logic-based processing in biosensors, especially in multi-input ones. The team  built up genetic networks that mimic a logic circuit function: in particular they implemented Multiplexer and Demultiplexer functions in E. coli.
The Team
Instructors: Maria Gabriella Cusella, Paolo Magni.
Advisor: Daniela Galli.
Students: Mattia Quattrocelli, Lorenzo Pasotti.
Awards
This project was awarded with a silver medal.

The Project
2009 UNIPV-Pavia iGEM Team
Last year the focus of the work was meant to valorize the wastes of dairy farming. The main waste of cheese production is whey, and the last step of its traditional processing is still characterized by high amounts of lactose. Whey is classified as "special waste" because its high concentration of lactose can increase the proliferation of bacteria, protozoa and algae in waters, lowering the level of oxygen. The measure of risk is summarized by BOD/COD parameter.  The team's goal was to valorize whey once proteins, lactose, carbohydrates have been successfully extracted from it. The team thought that degrade and metabolize the lactose left through microorganisms could be an interesting way. In particular, they used bacteria's ability to ferment lactose into ethanol, so that the efficiency of the whole process can definitely be improved.
