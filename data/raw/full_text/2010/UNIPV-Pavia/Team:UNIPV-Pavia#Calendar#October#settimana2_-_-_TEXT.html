OCTOBER: WEEK 2
October, 11th
We are now moving all our parts to <partinfo>pSB1C3</partinfo> plasmid
Colony PCR for I80 agar plate: 6 colonies were picked.
I80-4 is the right length. Inoculum for miniprep of the following day.
Inoculum of MC42-A, MC43-A, MG42-B, MG43-A, MC43_flip-a,b,c, MG43_flip-a,b,c, MG1655.

Miniprep of I80-4. DNA was sent to BMR-Genomics for sequencing.
Screening PCR was performed on MC42, MG42, MC43, MG43 and MG1655 with the following primers:
-BBa_K300975, BBa_K300976 (P1-P2)
-BBa_K300976, BBa_K300977 (P2-P3)
-BBa_K300977, BBa_K300978 (P3-P4).
The order of the samples were the follow: MC42, MC43, MG42, MG43, Cneg (MG1655), blank. Primers were (from left to right) BBa_K300975-BBa_K300976, BBa_K300976-BBa_K300977, BBa_K300977-BBa_K300978.
Screening PCR was performed on MC43_flip(A,B,C), MG43_flip(A,B,C) and MG1655 with the following primers:
-BBa_K300975, BBa_K300978 (P1-P4)
-BBa_G00100,BBa_G00101 (VF2-VR)
-BBa_K300977, BBa_K300978 (P3-P4).
The order of the samples was the follow: MC43_flip(A,B,C), MG43_flip(A,B,C), Cneg (MG1655), blank. Primers were (from left to right) BBa_K300975-BBa_K300978, BBa_K300977-BBa_K300978.
The order of the samples was the follow: MC43_flip(A,B,C), MG43_flip(A,B,C), Cneg (MG1655), blank. Primers were (from left to right) BBa_G00100-BBa_G00101.

For unknown reasons MC43_C didn't show any bands so we decided to perform again the screening with the same primers. At the same time we performed the screening PCR on the two negative controls with the primers BBa_K300977-BBa_K300978 and BBa_G00100-BBa_G00101. The results were the following:
The order of the samples was the follow: MG1655 (from 2 to 5) with BBa_K300977-BBa_K300978 primers, blank, MC43_flipC-1, MC43_flipC-2 with primers BBa_K300975-BBa_K300978, blank and MC1061 (from 10 to 13) with primers BBa_G00100-BBa_G00101
