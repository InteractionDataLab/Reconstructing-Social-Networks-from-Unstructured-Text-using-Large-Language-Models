BRAINSTORMING
So, we have a Team ! But now we face the most difficult task. Most people with different personalities and cultural education have to work together and combine their ideas to produce a successfull outcome. For this reason we decide to organize many meetings to exchange views and update on the work done. At the beginning all our meetings related to the birth of the Project , then it has become essential regular updating about Bio-Lab activity .
