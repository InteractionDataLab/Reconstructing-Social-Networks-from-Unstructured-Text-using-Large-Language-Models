Hi and nice to meet you again, I'm Giacomo, 25 years old, and if you remember me it's because last year I already took part in iGEM - this competition addicted me - as student. This year I'm advisor of the brand new team from Pavia and we are even more competitive than the last one!

I was born on November 14th, 1985 in Pavia.  I think that iGEM experience is terrific, for it gives the opportunity to meet new people and to enjoy a beautiful experience, both coltural and personal.
