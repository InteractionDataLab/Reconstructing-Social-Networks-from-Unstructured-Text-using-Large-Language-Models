Own BioBricks
All our own BioBricks of major importance were sequenced via one-shot sequencing by IIT Biotech (Bielefeld, Germany). The results, sequence (FASTA) and trace files, were aligned to the BioBrick sequences stored in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts and further analyzed with the software tools ‘’Clone Manager Professional Suite 6.0’’ (Sci Ed Central) and ‘’FinchTV 1.4.0’’ (Geospiza, Inc.). Finally, sequences with high quality scores were uploaded under ‘’Physical DNA – BioBrick Blast’’. Apart from minor and negligible, e.g. single nucleotide differing base at the scar, all of our sequencing results completely match the sequences in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
