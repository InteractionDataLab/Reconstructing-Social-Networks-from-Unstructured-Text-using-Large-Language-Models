Press for iGEM Bielefeld
We like to get a feedback to our work and to spread the world with the good opportunities of Syntethic Biology. Hence we did some cooperation with print, radio and tv media.
Print
Westfalen Blatt / local Newspaper:
We got a two-sided leading article in a daily local newspaper with a paid circulation of circa 150.000 copies. Moreover, the paper used the opportunity to discuss the postive and negative sites of Synthetic Biology in a commentary.

The first things for starting a PR-strategy are press releases. Therefore we wrote two press relaeses during the project. The releases explain the iGEM competetion as well as our general project idea. It is important for us to state that the projects are organised by the students themselves, which means fundraising, PR and practical research. You can find some of the publications below which followed our press releases.
Our press releases were published by the biotechnolgy cluster of the federal state of north rhine westphalia as well as by the department of education and research (Bundesminesterium für Bildung und Forschung).

WDR5:
We got the opportunity to present our project in a big federal state radio braodcast. The radio broadcast WDR5 is focused on cultural events and research. They produced three radio coverages about us, in order to present our project idea, the problems concerning the experimental research and the outcome of the project. Moreover, they communicated to the public how research is done and what methods are used. The radio station can be received by approximately 18 million listeners (internetbased radio not counted).
