Public Discussion
We had the great opportunity to present ourselves and our project in a café in Bielefeld to the general public. There, about 100 interested visitors listened to Prof. Dr. Alfred Pühler's introduction to synthetic biology and to our talk about iGEM and our MARSS project. The feedback was awesome! Prof. Dr. Pühler and we answered loads of questions of the curious audience concerning both technical and ethical aspects of our research.

Waffles!
As the deadline is pretty close and time is rare, we decided to bake some waffles. Besides making about 1000 delicious waffles, we took the chance to present our iGEM-project to the local students and folks of our university. Combining food and public relations was very successful... and tasty!
