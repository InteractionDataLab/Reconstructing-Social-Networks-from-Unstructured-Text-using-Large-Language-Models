Characterization of <partinfo>K389016</partinfo>
On this page the experiments and results that lead to the <partinfo>K389016</partinfo> characterization data presented on our characterization page are shown in detail.
Growth functions and mRFP expression for <partinfo>K389016</partinfo>
To characterize this part we performed several cultivations with different concentrations of acetosyringone as inducer and measured the fluorescence emitted by mRFP ( Protocol ). We used Escherichia Coli DB3.1 carrying the pSB1C3::K389016 plasmid. Even without inducer the bacteria carrying the plasmid showed decelerated growth. In addition acetosyringone affected the growth rates (we used a stock solution of 20 mM acetosyringone solved in 10 % (v/v) DMSO). Growth curves, averaged specific growth rates and doubling times are shown below. It can be observed, that E. coli carrying the pSB1C3::K389016 plasmid growths nearly linear.

The specific growth rates µ and doubling times td are calculated with the OD600 and following formulas:

Exemplary induction curves with the fluorescence normalized to OD600 are shown in Fig.2. We observed a basal transcription, but the induction with acetosyringone is undoubtedly. The detailed data analysis and transfer function is described below.

Transfer function of <partinfo>K389016</partinfo>
The data for the transfer function was measured and analyzed as described below . Nelson et al. (2002) suggest using a dose response function and fitting it with a logistical equation for the data analysis of receptor systems.  The data was fitted with a function of the form
(3)
with the Hill coefficient p, the bottom asymptote A1, the top asymptote A2 and the switch point log(x0). Figure 3 shows the measured normalized specific production rates qP,n (eq. 8) plotted against the logarithm of the concentration of the inductor acetosyringone in µM. The fit has an R2 = 0.99.

The important data from the transfer function is summarized in table 2:

So the fully induced VirA/G signaling system has a 2.6 fold increased expression compared to the uninduced system. The Hill coefficient is > 1, so a positive cooperation can be observed ( D Chu et al., 2009 ). The switch point of the system is at about 25 µM, so this is the concentration at which the device output is 50% of the maximum output.
Data analysis for <partinfo>K389016</partinfo>
The data analysis is made in three steps. First step is the processing of the fluorescence raw data gained by the fluorescence plate reader for every sample:
(4)
In the second step the RFUcorrected of every sample is plotted against the cultivation time it was drawn. The data is fitted by an exponential fit of the following style:
(5)
The accumulation of mRFP in the cells is always exponential. A typical fitted product accumulation curve is shown below:
Fig. 4: Exponential fit on the measured RFU plotted against cultivation time of a cultivation of <partinfo>K389016</partinfo> in Escherichia coli DB3.1 in LB medium with 10 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol and 150 µM acetosyringone.
The product accumulation in a cultivation can be described as:
(6)
with the amount of product P, the cell count X and the specific production rate qP.
RFU is commensurate to the concentration of mRFP (P) and the OD600 is commensurate to the cell count (X) ( Canton and Labno, 2004 ):
(7)
(8)
With these assumptions it is possible to calculate the specific production rate of mRFP qP in the third step: the specific production rate for every sample of a cultivation is calculated by the derivation of the exponential fit line which describes the accumulation of product in the culture (dRFU/dt) and the measured OD600 data:
(9)
The specific production rates qP of all samples of all cultivations made with a specific inductor concentration c are averaged and normalized against the specific production rate of the uninduced system qP,0:
(10)
This normalized specific production rate we calculated is commensurate to relative promotor units (RPU) which is commensurate to PoPS (polymerase per seconds) ( Canton and Labno, 2004 ; Pasotti et al., 2009 ):

Plasmid conformation analysis
A plasmid conformation analysis for the BioBrick <partinfo>K389016</partinfo> in <partinfo>pSB1C3</partinfo> was performed by the PlasmidFactory by Capillary Gel Electrophoresis (CGE). The chromatogram is shown in fig. 5 and the results in tab. 3. The data shows a high percentage of covalently closed circular (ccc) plasmid DNA. This is the biological active shape of plasmids so a high percentage of ccc plasmid DNA indicates a high quality of plasmid DNA ( PlasmidFactory ).

Different possible inducers
A list of tested possible inducers for a VirA/G signaling system is shown in tab. 4. These inducers where tested as a mix. The specific production rate of mRFP qP measured as described above for the mix did not significantly differ from the synthesis rate of the uninduced system (t-Test, p < 0.005). So none of the possible inducers listet in tab. 4 induce the VirA/G signaling system significantly in the measured concentration range. In tab. 4 the chemical structures of the testet possible inducers are shown, too. Acetosyringone is also in tab. 4 although it was not testet in the inducer mix to show the chemical similarity of the tested possible inducers to the natural inducer of the VirA/G signaling system.
