BioBricks
BioBricks are the central figure of the iGEM competition. It is pretty important to construct functional and well characterized BioBricks in order to avoid problems for other users. Unfortunately we had to handle some problems with BioBricks from the database. Although we created a lot of BioBricks, we therefore focused on creating good, functional and well characterized BioBricks. Our best three BioBricks are listed below. The detailed information of these BioBricks can be received by using the links.

Luciferase from pGL4.10[luc2]:

Correction of faulty BioBricks
Initially, we wanted to use the VirA BioBrick <partinfo>K238008</partinfo> and the virB promoter <partinfo>K238011</partinfo> in our project, but could only obtain unexpected/faulty restriction patterns. Finally we chose to sequence these parts, hoping to find the cause for the maintained restriction patterns. Unfortunately we could not approve the sequences of <partinfo>BBa_K238008</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K238011</partinfo> deposited in the partsregistry so that we chose to design our own VirA and virB promoter BioBricks. We strongly recommend using our VirA receptor and virB promoter since it has been approved by multiple means, e.g. restriction patterns and sequencing (<partinfo>K389001</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K389003</partinfo>).
Improvement of an existing BioBrick
By sending in our mutated virG gene <partinfo>K389002</partinfo> that works in E. coli without the rpoA gene from A. tumefaciens we improved the existing virG BioBrick from the registry <partinfo>K238009</partinfo>.
Characterizing already existing BioBricks
We helped characterizing the following BioBricks:
<partinfo>P1010</partinfo>
<partinfo>I746370</partinfo>
<partinfo>I746380</partinfo>
<partinfo>I746390</partinfo>
<partinfo>K343006</partinfo>
