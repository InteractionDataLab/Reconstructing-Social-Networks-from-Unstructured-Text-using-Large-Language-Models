Our project is supervised by Prof. Dr. Karsten Niehaus, Dr. Joern Kalinowski and Dr. Christian Rückert from Bielefeld University, respectively from the CeBiTec Bielefeld.
The Institute for Genome Research and Systems Biology (IGS) is a platform dedicated to support the development and implementation of joint research projects at the Center for Biotechnology. The main objectives of the institute are the coordination of interdisciplinary research projects, the organisation of workshops and seminars, and the presentation of activities and results of the research groups involved.
