3. Briefly vortex and spin down the reaction.
4. Incubate reaction at 37C for 3 hours.
Note: PCR program can be set to 37C for 3 hours and cooled down to 4C indefinitely.

Ligation
Ligation Reagents:
50 ng vector
DNA insert(s)
Buffer
1 ul Ligase
Ligation Reaction:
1. Calculate amount of DNA insert and vector needed for reaction.
150 ng / ( # bp in backbone/ # bp in insert) = ng needed
Concentration of insert or vector divided by ng needed = volume of DNA needed
2. Calculate amount of buffer needed depending on concentration for volume needed. A typical ligation reaction volume can be 20 ul.
3. Add reagents together, from smallest volumes to largest. Distilled water can be used to bring the volume up so that the reaction has the proper buffer concentration for the reaction. Ligase or enzymes in general should be added at the end.
4. Vortex or pipet up and down to mix. Spin down afterwards if vortexing.
5. Let reaction sit at room temperature for 5 to 20 minutes depending on ligase used. The ligase may start acting up if left too long.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Gel Electrophoresis Reagents/Materials:
Gel caster
Gel tray
Agar powder
TAE buffer
10, 000X Sybr Safe
50ml conical tube
Gel comb
Microwave
Large flask (microwave safe)
Preparing the agarose solution:
1. Pour in flask the amount of TAE buffer desired. This will be the volume of agarose solution made.
2. Measure out the amount of agar needed for desired concentration. For example to get a 1% agarose gel, you would add 1 gram of agarose powder to 100 ml of TAE buffer. Most concentrations commonly fall between 0.7- 2%.  Higher concentrations of agarose are better suited  for small fragment separation while lower concentrations are suitable for large fragments.
3. Microwave three minutes, may vary depending on volume in flask. Make sure cap is on loosely.
4. Using hot gloves, swirl bottle gently to ensure complete dissolving of agar. The solution should be clear when agar is completely dissolved. If it is not, microwave for another minute.
5. Place flask of agarose solution in 80C bath to store as to prevent solidifying of agarose solution.
Casting gel:
1. Secure gel tray in caster
2. Pour desired volume of premade agarose solution into 50 ml conical tube. Volume desired will vary depending on gel tray size and desired thickness of gel. Thin gels solidify quicker and can show faint bands clearer, but the wells of thicker gels can hold more DNA.
3. Add Sybr safe to agarose solution. For 10 ml of agarose solution, add 1ul Sybr Safe. The Sybr safe is used to stain and visualize the DNA when viewed under a blue light.
4. Invert tube several times until Sybr safe is equally distributed. Invert gently to avoid creating air bubbles.
5. Pour contents of conical tube into secured gel tray.
6. Place gel comb into notches of gel tray. Check that comb is evenly submerged in agarose.  The comb will form wells in the gel to load DNA.
7. Dry at room temperature. The gel will appear opaque when done.
Colony PCR
Colony PCR reagents:
12ul dH20
4 ul 5x gotaq green buffer
2 ul 10mM dntp
1 ul forward primer
1 ul reverse primer
0.1 ul GoTaq Polymerase
1. After adding reagents to PCR tube, pick a colony and touch the bottom of the PCR tube with the pipette.
2. Place PCR tubes into the PCR machine and set the cycling parameters to be optimal for the piece of DNA being copied.

TOPO cloning
Zero Blunt TOPO
- Follow manufacturer's protocol
Transfection
Jurkat Cell Transfection Protocol
1. Cultivate the required number of cells for samples.
2. Prepare DNA for each sample.
3. Pre-warm the supplemented Cell Line Nucleofector® Solution V to room temperature. Either pre-warm an aliquot of culture medium at 37°C in a 50 ml tube (500 μl per sample) or add an additional 500 μl in the step below.
4. Prepare 12-well plates by filling appropriate number of wells with 1 ml of culture medium containing supplements and serum. Pre-incubate plates in a humidified37°C/5%CO2 incubator.
5. Take an aliquot of cell suspension and count the cells to determine the cell density.
6. Centrifuge the required number of cells (1 x 106 cells per nucleofection® sample) at 500xg at room temperature for 5 min. Discard supernatant completely so that noresidual medium covers the cell pellet.
7. Resuspend the pellet in room temperature Cell Line Nucleofector® Solution V to a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/100 μl. Avoid storing the cell suspension longer than 15 min in Nucleofector® Solution as this reduces cell viability and gene transfer efficiency.
Important: Steps 8 - 13 should be performed for each sample separately.
8. Transfer the nucleofection® sample into an amaxa certified cuvette. Make sure that the sample covers the bottom of the cuvette, avoid air bubbles while pipetting. Close the cuvette with the blue cap.
9. Select the appropriate Nucleofector® program, X-01/X-001 or X-05/X-005 Insert the cuvette into the cuvette holder and press the “X” button to start the program.
10. After the program has finished (display showing "OK") take the cuvette out of the holder and incubate the sample in the cuvette for 10 min at room temperature.
11. If in step 3 you pre-warmed culture medium in a 50 ml tube, then after the 10 min incubation step, add 500 μl of this pre-warmed culture medium to the cuvette and transfer the sample into the prepared 12-well plates. If you added an additional 500μl to each well in step 4, then take 500 μl from the well, add to the cuvette, and transfer the sample back into the prepared 12-well plates.To transfer the cells from the cuvettes, we strongly recommend using the plastic pipettes provided in the kit to prevent damage and loss of cells.
12. Press the “X” button to reset the Nucleofector®.
13. Repeat steps 8 - 13 for the remaining samples. Cultivation after 15.Incubate cells in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator. Following nucleofection®,nucleofection® gene expression should be analyzed at different times. Depending on the gene, expression is often detectable after 4 - 8 hours. If this is not the case, the incubation period may be prolonged up to 24 hours.
