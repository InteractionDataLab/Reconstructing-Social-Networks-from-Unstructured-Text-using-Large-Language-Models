Future Implications
We expect that in the Future our Synthetic Cancer Killers would be equipped with GREATER PRECISION in the detection of cancer, STRONGER SIGNALING that would lead to a faster and stronger killing response, and BETTER ARSENAL to kill any kind of cancer they encounter (resistant or not)!
We would achieve this by modifying parts in the natural system (see other sections for more info).
Clinically, we envision to engineer Killer cells from cancer patients with our devices to make them powerful synthetic cancer killers. Upon transfusion of these engineered cells into the patient the cancer would be more efficiently eliminated. review on adoptive immunotherapy
