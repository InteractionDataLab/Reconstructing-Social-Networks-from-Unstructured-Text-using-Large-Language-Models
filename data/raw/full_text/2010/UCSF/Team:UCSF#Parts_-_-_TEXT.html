Parts submitted to the Registry
<groupparts>iGEM010 UCSF</groupparts>
During the summer we built more than 60 devices under the BioBrick standard RFC28 (see more info here ), which was developed by the UCSF team in 2009 and was approved by the Registry of Parts.  However, this year the Registry does not accept RFC28.  Due to time constrains, we could not move all of these parts into pSB1C3 and submit them as we had planned.
