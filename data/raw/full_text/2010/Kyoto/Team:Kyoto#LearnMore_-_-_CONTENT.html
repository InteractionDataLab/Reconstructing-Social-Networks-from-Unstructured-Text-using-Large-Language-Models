This is one of the inducible promoter parts in iGEM, which is often used by a lot of iGEM teams. R0011 is composed of a unique Lac promoter (<I>lac</I>P) whose promoter activity is stronger than an ordinary <I>lac</I>P of λ phage. First, we explain the ordinary <I>lac</I>P and subsequently the uniqueness of R0011.

This means that <I>lac</I>P has the strong promoter activity in the absence of LacI because RNA polymerase can approach the promoter and constitutively transcribe the downstream genes (Fig.2a). However, <I>lac</I>P decreases the activity with increasing LacI. At this time, LacI binds to the promoter and therefore RNA polymerase is prevented from approaching the promoter. As a result, the downstream genes are hardly transcribed (Fig.2b). When lactose is introduced, it binds to LacI and prevents LacI from binding to the promoter. Then RNA polymerase can approach the promoter and transcribes the downstream genes (Fig.2c).

Nevertheless, this hybrid design has the strong promoter activity. Moreover, this part is repressed by LacI and induced by lactose as same as <I>lac</I>P of lambda phage.

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id=".CE.BB_phage">λ phage</SPAN></H4><P>λ phage is temperate phage that undergoes ‘lysogenic cycle’ and ‘reproductive cycle’ (Fig.1). After infection, the viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it fairly harmlessly until host conditions deteriorate. After the deterioration, the endogenous phages (known as prophages) become active. At this point they start the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. λ phage’s lysis cassette is transcribed in reproductive cycle that causes lysis of the host cell <SUP><A href="#RefL001">[1]</A></SUP>.
</P><DIV class="thumbright"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:442px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig. 1: λphage life cycle.λ phage life cycle: λ phage binds to the target E. coli cell, the linear phage genome is injected past the cell membrane(a) and form the DNA circuit (b). At this point, if the host is in good condition, λ phage genome is inserted into host genome (c), λphage enter lysogenic cycle and repeat replication (e), while if the host is in bad condition or host condition deteriorates in lysogenic cycle, λ phage enters reproductive cycle (d), (f). In this cycle, important proteins such as structure proteins and lysis proteins are expressed and λ phages are made (g). Finally, λ phage go out of host by lysis (h).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lysis_system">Lysis system</SPAN></H4><P>S and R genes, which the lysis cassette includes, perform the important roles of the lysis system. S gene encodes ‘’holin’’ S105 which is a small (Mr 5 8,500) inner membrane (IM) protein and N-out, C-in with three transmembrane domains (TMDs)<SUP><A href="#RefL002">[2]</A><A href="#RefL003">[3]</A></SUP>(Fig.4a) and R, or endolysin, gene encodes a soluble transglycosylase which degrades ‘peptidoglycan’ <SUP><A href="#RefL004">[4]</A></SUP>.Holin’s function is not understood completely, but assumed as the system below (Fig.2). After ‘’holin’’ S105 is synthesized, holin is instantly inserted into IM. While a few holins are inserted into IM, each holins remains monomers (Fig.2a), and if enough holin is synthesized and inserted into IM, then holin monomers bind each other and form holin rafts, which is stable cluster (Fig.2b). Subsequently, if more holins are inserted, and a holin raft reaches a critical size, then a hole is made within the raft (Fig.2c). As a result, this hole enables the endolysin into the periplasm, and quickly results in cell lysis <SUP><A href="#RefL009">[9]</A></SUP>.

(a) Holins are monomers while a few holins are inserted. (b) Holins form rafts if more holins are inserted. (c) Holins form holes if the raft reaches a critical size. If S107 is inserted into IM, it is clear that raft and hole formation is delayed due to S107 antiholin function compared with the formation by only holin (b), (c). However, once a hole is formed, S107 function as holin, S107 also forms holes with holin (d).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="S107_function_as_antiholin">S107 function as antiholin</SPAN></H4><P>S gene encodes not only S105 but also ‘’antiholin’’ S107 <SUP><A href="#RefL012">[12]</A></SUP> which forms inactive heterodimers with the holin in the inner membrane <SUP><A href="#RefL007">[7]</A><A href="#RefL008">[8]</A></SUP>. 
The expression of these two proteins is regulated by the dual-start motif. Because S gene has two start codons, S mRNA produces S105 and S107 which are different in the Met-Lys N-terminal extension of S107 <SUP><A href="#RefL011">[11]</A></SUP> (Fig.3). This dual-start motif is regulated by two stem-loop RNA secondary structures <SUP><A href="#RefL010">[10]</A><A href="#RefL013">[13]</A></SUP>.
S107 also has three TMDs and is expected to become the similar structure to S105, but only two TMDs are inserted into IM, and TMD1 of S107 is localized in the cytoplasm, blocked from insertion into IM. This is because TMD1 of S107 has the positively charged residue, Lys2 and positively charged outside surface of IM repels Lys2 <SUP><A href="#RefL015">[15]</A></SUP>(Fig.4a). Because inserting TMD1 domain of S gene into the IM is essential for holins to form a hole, S107 prevents holins from creating a hole by forming a heterodimer with holin.
Thus S107 functions as antiholin and in addition, changes lysis timing <SUP><A href="#RefL008">[8]</A><A href="#RefL009">[9]</A><A href="#RefL010">[10]</A></SUP>.

When an S105-mediated hole formation event does occur in a cell, the resultant collapse of the membrane potential allows insertion of TMD1 of S107 into the membrane (Fig.4b), instantly tripling the amount of active holin by making the previously inactive pool of S105-S107 complexes functional <SUP><A href="#RefL014">[14]</A></SUP>(Fig.2). 
That is, S107 function as holin after many S105 form holes. 
That is why we cannot be satisfied with the strength of function of S107 as antiholin.
</P><P>Then, we use SΔTMD1, which is an allele with TMD1deleted and work as antiholin(Fig.4a and 5). Unlike S107, SΔTMD1 does not function as holin because of the deletion of essential TMD1 for hole formation(Fig.4b). 
In addition, S gene products form homodimers or heterodimers with each other by binding at TMD2.
So SΔTMD1 can form heterodimers with S105 and prevent holins to form holes <SUP><A href="#RefL011">[11]</A></SUP>. S107 is temporal antiholin but SΔTMD1 is dominant-negative holin.

</P><P>Unfortunately, it is known that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments <SUP><A href="#RefP001">[1]</A></SUP>. However, Kelly et al. found that this variation could be reduced by measuring the activity of promoters relative to &lt;partinfo&gt;J23101&lt;/partinfo&gt; which is a promoter as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity by ~50%. They defined a Relative Promoter Units (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units. In order to measure RPUs of promoters, the synthesis rate of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) encoded by mRNA transcribed from each promoter is observed.

</LI><LI>n is the copy number of the plasmid containing the promoter
</LI><LI>ρ is the rate of synthesis of immature GFP in absolute units of protein per second per mRNA.

</P><P>From equation 1 and 6 RPU is described as equation8.
</P><P>If the test promoter φ and the reference standard promoter are measured under the same culture conditions and both promoters are carried on the same backbone plasmid, following equations are approved.
</P><P>From equation 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, equation 13 is accomplished.
</P><P>In addition, immature GFP is stable so that protein degradation is negligible compared to dilution due to cell growth (γ<SUB>I</SUB>, φ=μ<SUB>φ</SUB> and γ<SUB>I,,J23101</SUB>=μ<SUB>J23101</SUB>, where μis the cellular growth rate). Therefore, equation 13 can be modified to equation 14:
</P><P>And if the growth rates of both strains are almost same, equation 15 is approved.
</P><P>Accordingly, we can make equation 16 from equation15.

</P><P>RPU can be calculated from equation 18 or equation 19. Therefore, we have to observe GFP synthesis rate and ABS (OD600) of both strains or to measure GFP concentration per cell and growth rate of both strains to measure RPU.
