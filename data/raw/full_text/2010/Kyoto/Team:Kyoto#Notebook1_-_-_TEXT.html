A vector of pSB4K5 is Kanamycin-resistance, however, we plated it to LB plate (Amp+). And We didn't pre-culture B0015 despite its vector is Kanamycin-resistance. So, it was predicted that we will fail the transformation of pSB4K5 and B0015.

PCR of E0240
E0240 is very important parts to measure RPU of promoters in iGEM. However, we failed to transfect it to E.coli from parts kit of iGEM. So we decided to amplify this parts by PCR.

Culture and Master Plates
pSB4K5 is inserted RFP generator. We didn't distinguish this inserted parts from low copy plasmid backbone, so self-ligated colony is red. So, white colony is correctly inserted parts.
However, white colonies and green colonies are observed in ML (1) and ML (2) plate. We cultured both white and green colonies.
In MS, Many of colonies are red, but green colonies are observed. We cultured green colonies.

As a result, deletion is succeeded, however, point mutation is failed. It is because DpnI is too little to digest all of template DNA.

Discussion: There ware some colonies, which emitted green light, on the plate 1.  So, we cultured those colonies on master plate. On the plate 5 and 6, even though we used KRX, which is able to repress lac promoter, colonies might be dead. However, we still have to do some experience so that we confirm lac promoter cannot repress enough and E. coli cannot survive.

Sample 3 and 4, SRRz-B0015 might be inserted in low copy plasmid correctly.  Sample 11, it might be the self-ligation product of low copy plasmid.  Anyway, we decided to culture those 4 colonies on master plate.

The propagation wasn't observed on some samples on CTLS cultured with M9-Kan +IPTG. It meant that the construction of CTLS was in success. However, the growth was observed on all of samples of LTCS. So, we decided to retry the construction of LTCS.

Except for CTLS4-2 and LTCS1 with Primer2, the sequencing of each sample were well performed. And LCT1, T2, LT2, and CT1 were confirmed that the sequence were correct. There was, however, deletion of some base pairs on lactose promoter [R0011]. of CTLS402.
Result: AATTGTGAGCGGATAACAAGATACTGAGCACA
BBa_R0011: AATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTGACATTGTGAGCGGATAACAAGATACTGAGCACA
There is repeated sequence on lactose promoter and the one was deleted. So, we supposed that the homologous recombination was occureed. From this result, we could say that the function check of CTLS was failed because SRRz gene wasn't induced by IPTG.
Making culture of LTCS and CTL
Tuesday, October 12 By: Ken
Screening of CTL
The propagation could not be observed with LB-Amp and could be observed with LB-Cp. It meant that the part, CTL, was correctly inserted to the plasmid, pSB1C3.
Making culture
Cultured two samples on each part: SΔTMD1-dT and SΔTMD1. Named T1,3,4 and 6.

Retry of the construction of CTLS
Friday, October 15 By: Ken
Screening of CTLS
Cultured CTLS with M9+IPTG. And the propagation couldn't be observed on one sample. We decided to use this sample.
Sequence Analysis
We did the sequencing on ML, MS, CTLS, T4 and CTL. The sequencing of T4 and CTL were in success and the others were failed. The results of CTL was desirable, but that of T4 was bad sequence and there was a mutation on PstI site. Including the last time sequencing, we could say that the deletion of GFP-terminator from SΔTMD1-GFP was failed. So, we decided to retry the deletion PCR.

Retry of deletion PCR of T2
We used PCR to delete GFP and terminator[E0840] from SΔTMD1-E0840.

Sequence Analysis

Deletion PCR of lac-SRRz
We used deletion PCR to get lac-SΔTMD1RRz.
