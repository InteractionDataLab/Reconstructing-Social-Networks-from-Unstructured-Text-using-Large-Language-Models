S107 is expressed by S gene encoded by lysis cassette and S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> is an S allele with the transmembrane domain 1(TMD1) deleted.
Because TMD1 of S gene is essential for the function of lysis cassette as killer gene, S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> inhibits lysis cassette stronger than S107.(<A href="/Team:Kyoto/LearnMore#Lysis_Cassette" title="Team:Kyoto/LearnMore">Learn more</A>)
So, we selected S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> as anti-killer gene.
</P><P>Then, we checked if S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> prevents lysis cassette from causing the cell death. 
To investigate the function of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB>, we used the E.coli transformed with both killer and anti-killer genes ( &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K358021&lt;/partinfo&gt;).
Because E.coli will be killed immediately if the killer-gene is constitutively expressed, we constructed the lysis cassette regulated by lac promoter. At first, the E.coli bacteria were grown in the medium without IPTG. After the population of E.coli become enough, they were cultured in the one with IPTG to express lysis cassette. After that, we checked the growth rate of E.coli by measuring the absorbance (OD 550) of the growth medium. Thus, we investigated the possibility whether E.coli that contains both the killer and anti-killer genes could alive due to the constitutive expression of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB>. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Method">Method</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Bacterial_strains">Bacterial strains</SPAN></H4><P>We used four types of E. coli as follows: (1) E. coli KRX transformed with &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K358021&lt;/partinfo&gt;, (2)KRX transformed with &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K358022&lt;/partinfo&gt;, (3)KRX transformed with &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K358024&lt;/partinfo&gt; and (4)KRX transformed with  &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K358019&lt;/partinfo&gt;.
After this, we call each E.coli to abbreviate in order of name, LB2-1, lacLΔ, LB2-2 and lacL.

It was used in experiment 1 and 2.

The black lines on bars' edges are error bar.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Then, in order to check if TMD1 of S gene is essential for this killer gene, we measured the cell number of lacLΔ, which does not have TMD1 of S gene and that is, encodes S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> and that of lysis cassette. 
This result is below (Fig.1).
From this result, after IPTG was added, the number of lacLΔ was not decreasing, while the number of lacLΔ was decresing.
It proved that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> cannot function as killer gene and TMD1 is essential for this killer gene, lysis cassette.
In addition, in the medium without IPTG, the number of lacLΔ is larger than that of lacLΔ. This supports a report <SUP><A href="#RefL001">[1]</A></SUP>, which says that more short proteins are expressed than the ones that are long.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experiment_2:_Function_check_of_S.CE.94TMD1">Experiment 2: Function check of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB></SPAN></H4><P>We measured the cell number of lacLΔ at several time after induction by adding several concentration IPTG.
The result is below (Fig.2).
This result showed that in the medium with more than 0.03mM IPTG, the number of E. coli is decreasing at a certain point.
It demonstrated that In at least more than 0.03mM IPTG, S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> can't inhibit lysis cassette completely.
Then, we measured the cell number of lacL in the same way, and compared the result of lacLΔ with that of lacL to check how S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> inhibited lysis cassette(Fig.2).
From this result, we knew in more than 0.5mM IPTG both lacL and LB2-1 were decreasing in the number at a certain point, or LB2-1 was a little delayed decreasing in the number. 
This demonstrated that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> can't correctly inhibit lysis cassette. 
So, we doubted whether S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> really functioned as anti-killer gene.
Although S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> has no TMD1 of S gene, S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> couldn't show the function as anti-killer gene.

That is, we were able to make sure that TMD1 of S gene is essential for lysis cassette as killer gene.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="S.CE.94TMD1_cannot_inhibit_lysis_cassette_completely">S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> cannot inhibit lysis cassette completely</SPAN></H4><P>These results showed that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> cannot inhibit completely lysis cassette.
This results can't supported a report on lysis <SUP><A href="#RefL001">[1]</A></SUP>, which says that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> without TMD1 dominant-negatively inhibit lysis cassette. 
Why did we get the result against that report? 
Probably, there were three reasons below, we thought.
</P><UL><LI>S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> in the plasmid did not worked correctly.
</LI><LI>S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> is weaker anti-killer gene than we expected.
</LI><LI>less S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> proteins or more lysis cassette proteins was expressed than we expected.
</LI></UL><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reason1:S.CE.94TMD1_in_the_plasmid_did_not_work_correctly.">Reason1:S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> in the plasmid did not work correctly.</SPAN></H5><P>To investigate this reason, we sequenced BBa_K358021 we used. 
The result showed that this construct is inserted into the plasmid correctly, which demonstrated that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> worked correctly.
So, we assume that the first reason is negative.
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reason2:_S.CE.94TMD1_is_weaker_anti-killer_gene_than_we_expected.">Reason2: S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> is weaker anti-killer gene than we expected.</SPAN></H5><P>As anti-killer gene against lysis cassette, there are two genes, S107 and S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> (<A href="/Team:Kyoto/LearnMore#Lysis_Cassette" title="Team:Kyoto/LearnMore">Learn more</A>).
S107 is the anti-killer gene. Because it has essential TMD1 of S for function of this killer gene, the anti-killer function of this gene is weak compared with S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB>, which does not have TMD1(<A href="/Team:Kyoto/LearnMore#Lysis_Cassette" title="Team:Kyoto/LearnMore">Learn more</A>).
Thus, we expected that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> is a strong anti-killer gene. However, from the result of experiment 2, we could not observe the function of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> as a strong anti-killer gene under the tested condition.
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reason3:_Expression_balance_between_the_anti-killer_and_killer_genes_was_not_optimized_properly">Reason3: Expression balance between the anti-killer and killer genes was not optimized properly</SPAN></H5><P>In order to investigate the possibility of this reason, we analyzed the expression level of the killer gene, lysis cassette and S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB>.  
As a report <SUP><A href="#RefL002">[2]</A></SUP> says, it is necessary for the inhibition of lysis cassette that there are at least ~4.7 times more S107, anti-killer gene than lysis cassette proteins. 
So, inhibition of this killer gene needs at least ~4.7 times more expression of the anti-killer gene than that of the killer gene. Thus, we calculated the ratio of the expression levels of the killer and anti-killer gene. The calculation was done under the assumptions　that S gene, which includes lysis cassette, produces S105 and S107 at a 2.5:1 ratio(<A href="/Team:Kyoto/LearnMore#Lysis_Cassette" title="Team:Kyoto/LearnMore">Learn more</A>), and that the strength of function of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> as anti-killer gene is the same as that of S107. By this calculation, we knew that in LB-1, the anti-killer gene couldn't inhibit killer gene in the medium with more than 0.1246 mM IPTG. So, we assume that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> was not expressed adequately to inhibit lysis cassette completely. 
We assume that our experimental results could be due to the 3rd reason (Reason 3) mentioned above, although we cannot rule out the possibility of the second reason. However, it has been reported <SUP><A href="#RefL001">[1]</A></SUP> that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> inhibits lysis cassette effectively. So, it is reasonable to assume that S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> exhibits enough activity to inhibit lysis cassette. That is why we think that the Reason 3 is the most likely answer. To confirm this possibility, we changed the promoter of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> to stronger one. The experiment to check the function of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> using the strong promoter is currently underway. Surely, this result will help us to understand why S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> could not function as we expected and to develop distinct cell-death controllable devices for the further studies. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</SPAN></H3><P>1)We made and registered S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> by deleting TMD1 of S gene and  lysis cassetteΔTMD1(S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB>RRz) in BioBrick as new parts. 
2)By the comparison of the function as killer gene between lysis cassette and lysis cassetteΔTMD1, We made sure that TMD1 is essential for fuction of lysis cassette as killer gene.
3)By co-expressing lysis cassette regulated by a lactose promoter, we characterized the function of S<SUB>ΔTMD1</SUB> as anti-killer gene.
